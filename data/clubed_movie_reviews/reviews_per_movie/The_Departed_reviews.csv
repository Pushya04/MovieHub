Moles And Rats,"When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime. It's not my favorite Scorsese film, that honor belongs to Casino for me. But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well, rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond.Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed, Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime. The film is simple enough, the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello. That was Scorsese's little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day, although his real name was an Italian one.Nicholson's character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area. He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate. I didn't add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life.Getting this man won't be easy because he has a full bag of tricks. One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy, concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division. A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations.But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood. At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side. There are no dummies on either side, the police aren't keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come.Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast. Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts. Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine.Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time. The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese. Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year, he might have been nominated himself if he wasn't up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond.The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson's character is in the film. If you think you know how this film ends, I guarantee you will be wrong. Nicholson's character has survived in many ways, that's all I can say.Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston's atmosphere, as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas. He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time. The cast didn't let Martin down at Oscar time and they won't let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Twist endings and Leo, name a better duo","Nicholson, Damon, and Dicaprio make for an absolute powerhouse trio in this classic film. I have had this on my watch list for quite some time, and although it wasn't as rock solid as I was expecting, it's ending was right up my alley. Aside from the phenomenal acting and the satisfying conclusion, I was only impressed with the simplicity of which a complex double-rat story was told. I never felt lost trying to keep track of who worked for who and who was spying on who, because the filmmakers laid it out so clearly for me.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Superb acting on top of brilliant storytelling,"Now I know that 'The Departed' is based off of the Hong Kong movie 'WuJianDao', but Scorsese really grabs hold of a great story and brings it to the American Screen. My father grew up in Boston and when we walked out of the theater he couldn't stop talking about how authentic the environment and attitude was. Then there's the acting in which the lead actors (Nicholson, DiCaprio, Damon) not only give stunningly entertaining performances, but you become engulfed in each one's perspective and dilemmas. The smaller roles that of (Baldwin, Walberg, Sheen) are supporting roles that remind me of Jesus Quintana from 'The Big Lebowski', by this I mean that their screen time is limited but they make lasting impressions that you cherish each and every scene they are in, Alec Baldwin especially. The story itself starts off with the basic intro of the players and the setting, but you'll find yourself slowing following each and every plot twist and rooting back and forth for the good guys and for the bad guys. If you're a Scorsese fan, which I am, I think you will appreciate this film. You can clearly see the Scorsese touch ranging from the cinematography and of course the music, it's great to hear ""Gimme Shelter"" again, but ""Comfortably Numb"" played in so well. It's another gangster flick from Scorsese, yet this one stands alone because feels so fresh and most would agree Scorsese does gangster films the best; so why not let him. Oscar worthy, the acting I certainly hope; this is DiCaprio's best role since 'The Aviator' which was his best role since 'Gangs of New York', am I seeing a pattern here. But my lasting impression wasn't concerned with the politics of the golden statue; my lasting impression was that I had sat through 2 and half hours of brilliant and especially entertaining storytelling. Thank you Mr. Scorsese.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Lies, Betrayal, Sacrifice. What will you believe?","First off, this is an American stylized remake of the Hong Kong hit, Infernal Affairs. I have to give credit to that, a good film. I have seen both Infernal Affairs and The Departed. I personally prefer The Departed, and I think because of one thing: Martin Scorsese. This is the master behind such greats as Taxi Diver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, and he's at it again. The film has an all star cast with Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, and Alec Baldwin.The Direction was amazing. (maybe one of the reasons why he won the Oscar for it) I loved how some of the scenes were shot and set up. Especially regarding the Chinatown, and police interrogation scenes, among many others. The film is perfectly set up with intense, suspense scenes while adding in amounts humor at times. It works really well. The script is top notch. (Also Oscar winning) Realistic strong dialogue from scene to scene.Another thing I liked more in The Departed, as opposed to Infernal Affairs, was the acting. DiCaprio really seemed to earn a lot of respect from this role. Here, he takes on the tough guy persona so well. Sure it was known he was a good actor from his Oscar nominated performances in What's Eating Gilbert Grape and The Aviator, but he really takes it to another level here. I can't see anyone else as the character, he fits so perfectly with it. Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg, being Massachusetts natives, also give solid performances, with their natural accents. Nicholson works well in his role, as well. Everyone was extremely solid and everything seemed so real.Set in Boston, The Departed takes in all the Boston like atmosphere. Beautifully shot scenes of the Massachusetts Golden Dome State Capital building is just one part of the landscape. The Dropkick Murphys song ""I'm Shipping up to Boston"" really fits, great use of songs. Scorsese usually works music into his films really well.""Cops or Criminals. When you're facing a loaded gun what's the difference?"" This quote really represents the film."" Matt Damon plays a state officer in the Police, working for the crime boss of the area, Frank Costello (Nicholson). While Damon's character can be described as a ""bad guy,"" he is really misunderstood. As a kid, he is sort of mentored into crime business by Costello while Costello becomes the father figure Damon's character never had. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a young guy, coming from a bad, crime ridden family. He's decides to become a police officer to get away from the crime life he's been surrounded by. Taking all this into account, Captain Queenen (Sheen) and Seargent Dignam (Wahlberg) decide to send DiCaprio's character undercover to find out more about the criminal underworld and Costello. With his family's crime record, he fit's perfectly into the situation. Now you have a highly ranked officer working for bad guy, and an undercover cop in the criminal underworld working for the State Police. From here it's an all out suspenseful thrill ride. Who's who? Who's working for who? Who can you trust? Paranoia threatens everyone. Lies. Betrayal. Sacrifice. How far will you take it?At the heart of this film is character development. We really feel for the characters. We feel like we know them. It's really amazing part of this story and film. Tremendous story telling here.This is one of the most entertaining and suspenseful crime/drama's I have seen in a while. While Infernal Affairs, came first, I think The Departed expands on it in so many ways. Really solid crime/drama. Check both out when you get a chance. It's really worth it. 9/10",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Martin Scorsese Hits the Streets Again!,"Please don't make negative comments like some of the aforementioned people have been doing if you haven't seen the film yet! I have seen it, at a press screening last week. Not only is it the best film of the year so far, it marks a return to form for Martin Scorsese, and ranks with the likes of GOODFELLAS as being one of the best in his canon of films.I'm a fan of the Hong Kong film, INFERNAL AFFAIRS, upon which this is based. While THE DEPARTED keeps the basic structure of the original, it is very much its own movie, so much so that the screenwriter, William Monahan, didn't even watch the original film while adapting its screenplay, thus enabling him to infuse the script with his, and Scorsese's, respective visions.All the actors are first-rate (yes, even Leo, for all you DiCaprio bashers out there), and turn in some of their best performances to date. THE DEPARTED is sure to garner a host of Oscar nods, if not wins, including (hopefully) Scorsese's long-overdue statuette for Best Director. Plus, with actors like Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin playing supporting roles, that says a lot about the quality of the film they signed up for! THE DEPARTED is tough stuff, not for the faint-of-heart. That said, it is a must-see for adult viewers who long for intelligent, gritty stories to grace our movie screens once again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Amazing movie, with an ensemble cast.","Boston Police are trying to bring down Gangland boss Frank Costello, Billy Costigan goes undercover to try and nail him from the inside, but his actions are countered by Colin Sullivan, a criminal who has infiltrated The Police, handing information to Costello.This film doesn't date, as I'm watching it, it is now seventeen years old, and apart from the flip top phones, oxycontin, and the fresh faces of DiCaprio and Damon, it has hardly dated.Intense, fast paced, gritty and violent, it doesn't hold back for one second, I'd place The Departed in my top ten list of greatest films. The action sequences are tremendous, and there's a subtle humour rubbing through it. Even if this film doesn't quite fit into your favourite genre bracket, I suggest you still watch, it's an incredible movie.It's one of those films that gets better with subsequent viewings, you may struggle to put some of the pieces together first time round, knowing what's happening only seems to make it more satisfying.The cast, has there ever been a more incredible cast assembled, it's a tour de force from Jack Nicholson, but Damon, DiCaprio, Winstone, and many more are all fantastic.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A cat and mouse game done at it's finest.,"An undercover cop and a mole in the police attempt to identify each other while infiltrating an Irish gang in South Boston. Let me start off with saying that this is my favorite movie, no doubts about it. the movie starts out slow with it's LONG intro, but picks up and never breaks pace. I normally hate pace breaking in movies, so this is already a big + in my book. the story is interesting to watch as Dicaprio and Damon struggle with their identities while Jack Nicholsen has some fun as the bad guy. This movie has a great plot, cast, music score, length and almost all elements of movies possible such as: drama, comedy, action, crime, thrills and suspense and many more. The Departed is a great movie and should be recognized as one.I find nothing wrong with it. maybe the lack of female characters, but it ain't that bad.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Scorsese's best since Goodfellas!,"He has made good musicals (New York, New York), surreal comedies (After Hours), satires (The King of Comedy) and biopics (The Aviator), but Martin Scorsese has never done better than the times he's dealt with life on the streets and gangsters. Mean Streets, Goodfellas and Casino (and, to some degree, Taxi Driver) are proof of that. It doesn't seem strange, then, that his finest film in over a decade (Goodfellas was released in 1990) sees him return to that familiar ground. With a few changes.The Departed, based on Hong Kong thriller Infernal Affairs (2002), is Scorsese's first gangster film not to feature Italian-American criminals. In fact, this film is set in Boston, where the Irish rule. One of these ""godfathers"" is Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), the man the State Police want the most. After years of investigation, they're finally getting close, thanks to undercover agent Billy Costigan (Leonardo Di Caprio). Because of his family (all Irish, all bad), becoming a member of Costello's crew isn't that difficult. Now all Costigan has to do is report to his superiors, Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Dignam (Mark Wahlberg), who will pass on the information to Ellerby's (Alec Baldwin) Special Investigations Unit. What they don't know is that Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), the most promising element of said unit, has been on Costello's payroll since he was 12. Soon enough, both cops and crooks become aware of the situation, beginning a manhunt that's gonna make the already fragile Billy even more nervous and Costello increasingly crazier.By moving from Hong Kong to Boston, Scorsese and screenwriter William Monahan have made the first step in ensuring this film will be quite different from its Chinese inspiration. Another significant factor is the running time: a mere 97 minutes for Infernal Affairs, 150 for The Departed. This is due to new characters (Dignam and Costello's henchman Mr French, played by Ray Winstone, were missing in the original) and subplots, such as the one concerning Madolyn (Vera Farmiga), a psychiatrist who gets emotionally involved with both of the moles. But the most crucial difference is in the depiction of the underworld: whereas IA was stylish without being excessive, Scorsese's vision comprises very colorful language (some insults are so creative one might expect Joe Pesci to show up) and, of course, buckets of blood, the last part of the movie proving to be particularly shocking. None of the scenes ever reach the gross-out level of Casino's head-in-the-vice scene, but in pure Scorsese tradition it remains unflinchingly violent (also notable is the music, perfectly setting the mood, scene after scene, alongside Thelma Schoonmaker's impeccable editing).Amidst these brutal surroundings, the director handles a spot-on cast: Baldwin, Sheen and Wahlberg (the latter finally back on form) make good use of their little screen time, Damon fine-tunes the edgier side he showed in The Talented Mr Ripley and the Bourne movies, and Nicholson, playing the villain again at last, delivers another OTT but classy turn (original choice Robert De Niro would probably have played the part with more calm and subtlety). A special mention is needed for Di Caprio: working with Scorsese for the third consecutive time, he has finally found a way to shake off his Titanic image, thanks to a vulnerable, gripping (and arguably career-best) performance.With its clever plot, excellent acting and expert direction, The Departed is without doubt the year's best film so far. If this really is going to be his last gangster film (he has said so), as well as his last studio-endorsed picture, Scorsese can be proud, given the masterpiece he has given us. If only they gave him the Oscar in return...",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Sublime Scorsese,"Definitely the the type of movie that makes it worth going to the theater. Very intense action and violence, twisting plot, lot's of misdirection.The story line is a bit overly whelming at times, this isn't a good movie to watch if you're tired and follow the action, the double crosses and the sometimes confusing who's who of the movie, but if you can just remember the basic characters the minor twists won't be too confusing.While it's certainly not a love story, there is that element, with a bit of a morality play going the whole time.I can't make some of the statements I'd like to make because I really try to avoid spoilers in my reviews, but I'll say that I enjoyed the movie even though had I been in charge it may have ended differently...All that said, if you like a thriller that has some rough and tough violence and a plot with a few twists and turns this film would be one I'd recommend to you.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Brilliant,"Before seeing this, I knew I was in for a treat, given that it's a Scorsese movie, but The Departed was even better than I expected.The acting is outstanding. Leonardo DiCaprio gives what is quite possibly the best performance of his career. Even the people who hate him admit he did a good job. It's turned some haters into fans and my brother who despises him even says he was great. Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson give their best performances since The Talented Mr. Ripley and As Good As It Gets. Mark Wahlberg almost steals the show with the best lines. Ray Winstone, Alec Baldwin, and Martin Sheen are good, too.Definitely one of the best films of the 00's. And easily one of the best remakes of all time. It's intense, funny, exciting, suspenseful, superbly acted, violent, has great characters, and has one of the most shocking scenes I've ever seen. And there's not a boring moment in it's two and a half hour running time.The film will most likely be nominated for picture, director and adapted screenplay, and in my opinion, it deserves all three of them. DiCaprio and Wahlberg also deserve nominations.See this as soon as you can.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Fantastic Bro,"Excellent. A great, great movie. I saw it last night at a special screening and must say it was a tour de force. Even though Boston is not really a gritty town Scorsese was able to capture a darker side of the city. Coming from that area, I am always concerned when actors put on the local accent as it tends to be distracting rather than supportive. However, with local pros like Damon and Wahlberg they were able to really grab hold of it and not go overboard... most of the time. The true stand out performance has to go to DiCaprio. He has really come into his since hooking up with Scorsese, having scored a number of original performances all of which have expanded his range. He really snagged onto a deep and tragic character and created something that will hopefully be recognized come awards season. One of my favorite aspects was the friendly hostility the characters had for each other. It is a specific trademark that I have never noticed in any other city. In Boston, when you are really close with someone (or not really) it is, more or less, a requirement to bust their balls and shoot cruel insults back and forth in rhythmic banter. That detail was extensively realized in THE DEPARTED and I doubt anybody who was raised outside of the metro Boston area, or at least visited at some point, would find it nearly as hilarious as those who were. As for Scorsese's direction, I think he scored big with this one. While many have criticized that his movies have become more commercial I believe that he has just evolved. There were some classic Scorsese moments here, my favorite being a scene where DiCaprio is alone and packing his things in his apartment. Beautifully cut and stylistically directed. Is it his best effort? No. But it still is truly mesmerizing. He has created something truly special from a city that is highly underrated.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Whatever I say does not do this film justice,"The DepartedThe screenplay: Top NotchThe performances: all-star cast delivering all-star performancesThe music: perfectThe Directing: Martin Scorsese at his finest and that is saying something.Once again Scorsese delivers a film that meets or exceeds the expectations of its audience in nearly every way. There are moments of incredible tension, violence, and drama, moments where characters reveal their vulnerabilities and weakness. Comedic moments and moments of sadness and through it all a multi layered and brilliant story is told by an American film maker who once again proves Harvey Keitel correct when he said, ""Maybe he (Scorsese) got what he deserves--exclusion from the mediocre.""This film is Scorsese's finest work since Raging Bull, but it is not simply about Martin Scorsese or the amazing screen play by William Monahan, it is more than an amazing score, and great cinematography. While many of the accolades for this film belong to those behind the scenes people who envisioned and directed this film. One would be remiss to not point out the great performances of an all-star cast, many of whom deliver the finest performances of long and storied careers. Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon deliver incredible performances.However the performance that stood out for me was Wahlberg, Mark Wahlberg's Sgt. Dignam stole every scene he was in, and he shared screen time with each of the afore mentioned actors. He gets to deliver some of the best lines, and with every scene he leaves the audience wanting more, and anticipating his next scene.Since The Academy has had its collective heads stuck  for so long, mentioning a Scorsese picture and Oscar in the same sentence seems to be a waste of time. That being said I can not say if he will finally win the Oscar that he has deserved for so long, as his major competition (Flags of our Fathers) has yet to be released, I will say that I expect to see Wahlberg nominated for best supporting, and Leo and Damon will be pitted against one another once more, this time for best actor, Monahan will be nominated for writing, and of course Scorsese will be nominated for director. Also, it goes without saying a best picture nomination will be in order for The Departed.That was the long version; the short version is if you like a movie with incredible performances, direction, music and visuals. If you like a layered story that is not formulaic, in short if you appreciate film making and story telling at its finest then see this film. Even with the glowing reviews of myself and others, and the high expectations they will undoubtedly bring I assure you that you will not be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The Film with it All. Perfection.,"Arguably Martin Scorsese's most action-driven production sees a high brow cast rise to their assignments and add their own special touches on an already glossed finished product - The Departed is simply flawless.An undercover agent and a spy constantly try to counter-attack each other in order to save themselves from being exposed in front of the authorities. Meanwhile, both try to infiltrate an Irish gang.The Scorsese collection is a breathtaking phenomenon, epitomising his dedication and class in the industry, still, today, the 79-year-old continues to provide entertainment for our film-loving pleasures. The Departed was released in 2006 with Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg (as well as many more great actors) star in the crime/drama. DiCaprio even called his only one-to-one scene with Nicholson as ""one of the most memorable moments of my life"". Scorsese described the film as one of the few he has directed which ""actually contains a plot"", as absurd as it may sound at first hearing, The Departed is a controlled picture which isn't forced, it understands the correct balance of speed in its depiction of the timeline and doesn't sway a favourable way. The watch is well-measured and keeps its audience enticed by its uncertainty and regular sharp turns. 5 Academy Award nominations and 4 wins, only Mark Wahlberg's Supporting Actor nod was turned away, the film picked up a total of 97 awards most notably for its sensational image and the magnificent, artistic work of Scorsese who catalysed the production's success. The writing in the play is infectious with clever exchanges implying nothing to its spectators, credit to the crew who unpicked Alan Mack and Felix Chong's thrilling Hong Kong picture Internal Affairs and adapted it into a trope of cinema.An Irish Mafia tale fuelled with excitement and amazement. 'Entertainment Weekly' put it on its end-of-the-decade ""Best of"" list, saying: ""If they're lucky, directors make one classic film in their career.

Enjoyable thriller but there are failings and missed targets across the running time,"The war between the police and the organised crime in Boston has reached new heights. Both Oliver Queenan and target #1 Frank Costello have placed a mole into each other's organisations. Billy Costigan is selected to infiltrate Costello's ranks thanks to a family background of criminals and working men, meanwhile Colin Sullivan has been groomed since youth to come up inside the ranks of the BPD. As Costigan makes progress it becomes clear to his police superiors that they too have a rat feeding information outwards. With only Frank knowing Sullivan's identity and Queenan and Dignam knowing Costigan's, a race begins with the first one to expose the other winning.Having enjoyed the original film, I was quite looking forward to this film and not really worried that Hollywood would mess it up. In a way it does deliver but it is hard to ignore the problems and failings in the film and if I didn't realise how IMDb put together their top 250 list, I would be amazed that the film is running so high up it. The original was a tight cop thriller which I remember thinking owed much to American cinema in style and tone, so surely America can only do it better? Well, if not better then this is certainly bigger, with stars oozing out of every pore, a big director and a long running time. In regards the latter, the film should be commended for moving slickly through the 150 minutes and not feeling as long as it is. The fact that it is cool, engaging and quite exciting will be enough for most audiences and indeed the sheer volume of positive votes on this site shows it has struck something of a chord, but this is not to say it is a classic and those putting it alongside Goodfellas are simply out of their trees.The script here tries to give more room for growth to the characters, to explore their feelings outside of the tension and fear of their situation. Unfortunately this produces many scenes that are a bit dull and unconvincing as they attempt to deepen the material. Specifically I am talking about the thread involving the girlfriend, her scenes add little and the dialogue in the session scenes is obvious and, as a Sopranos viewer, I was surprised by this. A secondary downside of this (although not totally to blame) is that it is not as gripping and claustrophobic as I would have liked. Yes it is thrilling at times but I wanted it to be consistent like a real cat'n'mouse game with the noose tightening palatably around each character's neck as they raced to hang the other first. The ending is also a little less effective than it should be because, added to the original's strong ending is an extra scene that doesn't have a strong foundation and is not as good as it should have been.Ironically for such a starry affair, some of the performances are a bit weak, and I'm thinking specifically of Damon. He never seems like the flipped version of Costigan and I never really got the feeling of him being trapped, panicked and hunted in the same way as his opposite number was. Conversely then DiCaprio is pretty strong and is convincing as he loses himself into Costello's gang of murderers. He works well alongside a scene-stealing Nicholson. At times he threatens to completely tip over into ham but for the most part he is just larger than life and provides a lot of energy to the film. This energy is harnessed well by director Scorsese who directs with this usual eye for a setup and also an enjoyable soundtrack. The use of sudden stops in the music and quick cuts is perhaps a bit much to get used to but it is strangely effective. The support cast is impressive in depth but they are not all that well used. Walhberg has all the best lines but it seems like he has wandered in from another movie at times and, funny as he was, he is never the developed and involved character that he needed to be for the way the narrative required. Baldwin is the same although he is more restrained and fits better, while Sheen is a nice touch of class. The woman playing the girlfriend is as weak as her material and although she did have an important part in the story, she adds very little beyond the writing on the page.Overall though, this is a strong and professional film and it is a shame that it isn't as good as I wanted. The attempts to paint detailed and complex characters makes it interesting but not as convincing as it needed to be  with Damon in particular left out there with little to work with in comparison to DiCaprio. The moments of slick tension and action are very good though and the only downside was that it made me wish for more of the same and that Scorsese had focused on keeping it tight and taut in the same way that the superior original had.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Better than Goodfellas?,"Dare I? Dare I say it? This movie is better than Goodfellas. There, I said it.I saw this latest Scorsese film at an advance screening.

I was very wrong.Though the exact plot is unimportant, The Departed is about the blurred lines that distinguish good guy from bad guy, and cop from robber, in present-day Boston. With a packed cast (which I need not mention) that includes great supporting roles by Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin, the acting in the departed is stellar. Living-legend Jack Nicholson flawlessly delivers one of his best performances in years as the execrable mob boss Frank Costello. Nicholson's nuanced acting was so on-point that at times I felt like I was actually about to be shot by the slimy capo.The Departed is nothing short of spectacular.

I wasn't sure what to expect and actually planned on being a little disappointed with all the expectations and hype of such an all-star cast.From the moment the opening credits came up, the movie grabbed me by the neck, ripped me out of my seat and didn't let go until the final scene.Each performance is more masterful than the next. Damon was a tour de force as the lead, tapping every ounce of his acting reservoir for this role. Nicholson creates another classic role to add to his already sterling resume. His mob boss would almost steal every scene he was in, if it not for every other actor being so fantastic However, the biggest surprise for me personally came from Leonardo DeCaprio.Having never warmed up to any of his roles or movies, I found myself blown away by him in this. I'm not sure if it was the material he was given, or if DeCaprio has grown this much as an actor, or a combination of both, but he finally won me over with his role in this instant Scorsese classic. Every character is pitch perfect, every scene is right on the money. The plot builds to a crescendo of such dynamic proportions rarely seen on film. I don't want to give too much away, but I'm still shaken from the ride I was taken on.People go to the movies in the hopes that maybe once in a hundred times you get to experience storytelling so masterful and transcendent that it changes the way you view cinema. This is one of those spectacularly perfect times.Forget Taxi Driver. Forget Raging Bull. Forget Goodfellas. As much as I LOVE those movies and as much as they have affected me in my lifetime, The Departed will hands down be Martin Scorsese's Master Work.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Scorsese Does it Again,I think I would enjoy a Scorsese movie about making butter!He's a genius and we are all lucky to have him.Its a good story (a remake) that is largely swept to great heights by the performances of the cast.There are over 2000 review for this movie so I don't think I need to add much.Its really great entertainment that won't let you down.Enjoy!,8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

This one is about the mark of a great director,"Like i said, this film is about the mark of a great director, in this case a well paced, well written, violent movie with a great choice of songs, a mark that Scorsese is known for doing so well, but this one here is not his best film (not saying it's bad, far from it) but definitely not the one he should have won the oscar for, in my opinion the film that the Academy should give his best director award, was way back for Raging Bull, also not forgetting that he wasn't even nominated for Taxi Driver, but anyway, judging this film, it have a great cast, full of good performances, especially by Leonardo Dicaprio and Mark Wahlberg.Also, this movie is a remake of a 2002 Hong Kong film called Mou gaan dou, the second time that Scorsese did a remake, the first one being Cape Fear (1991).",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
*A Masterpiece of Betrayal and Identity*,"Martin Scorsese's ""The Departed"" is a brilliant tour de force that stands as one of the defining works of the crime thriller genre. With its gripping narrative, nuanced character development, and a powerhouse cast, the film weaves a complex tale of loyalty, deception, and the moral ambiguity that lies at the heart of organized crime.Set against the gritty backdrop of Boston, ""The Departed"" follows two men on opposite sides of the law: Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), an undercover cop infiltrating the Irish mob, and Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), a mole in the police department working for the crime boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). The dual narratives create a captivating tension as both characters struggle to maintain their identities while navigating a world filled with betrayal and danger.Scorsese's expert direction transforms the screenplay into a visceral experience. The pacing is relentless, and the tension builds to an explosive climax that keeps audiences on the edge of their seats. Every scene is meticulously crafted, from the intense confrontations to the quieter, more reflective moments. The film's gritty realism is enhanced by its superb cinematography, expertly capturing the raw emotions and harsh realities faced by the characters.Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a career-defining performance as Billy Costigan, conveying the character's internal conflict and psychological turmoil with remarkable depth. Matt Damon's portrayal of Colin Sullivan provides a fascinating contrast; he embodies the charming façade of a man torn between duty and betrayal, creating a sense of unease that permeates the film. Jack Nicholson, in his role as Frank Costello, is nothing short of magnetic, bringing an unpredictable energy to the screen that leaves an indelible impression.The screenplay, adapted from the Hong Kong film ""Infernal Affairs,"" is sharp and layered, filled with razor-edged dialogue that resonates with the audience. Themes of duality and loyalty are expertly intertwined throughout the film, reflecting the moral complexities of good and evil, and leaving viewers questioning the nature of identity itself.Moreover, the film is elevated by an exceptional supporting cast, including Mark Wahlberg, who delivers a standout performance as Dignam, a foul-mouthed yet insightful cop. His presence adds a layer of authenticity and humor amidst the tension, creating memorable moments that punctuate the narrative.The film's score, featuring a mix of classic rock and haunting melodies, perfectly complements the mood and intensity of the story, enhancing the viewing experience and making each pivotal moment even more impactful.In essence, ""The Departed"" is not just a crime thriller; it is a profound exploration of identity, morality, and the ever-blurring lines between good and evil. Scorsese's masterful direction, combined with stellar performances and a compelling narrative, culminates in a cinematic experience that is both exhilarating and thought-provoking. This film is a testament to the complexities of human nature, making it a timeless classic that continues to resonate with audiences long after the credits roll. ""The Departed"" is a must-see, a film that cements Scorsese's legacy as one of the greatest directors in cinematic history.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Good, but very familiar story of cops and robbers","Remake of Infernal Affairs is not the second coming of the gangster film that some proclaimed it. It is a very good, if decidedly over long tale of cops battling robbers with moles on each side trying to remain hidden.The plot is simple, a cop is sent undercover in the mob at the same time a crook works his way into the police force. Complicating matters is the fact that the bosses on both sides quickly realize that a rat is among and they begin the search to ferret out the mole.The original Infernal Affairs is one of the better Hong Kong Films of the last ten years. Its a well told tale with some nice stylish twists. If the original has any flaws its that the film falls in love with itself in the second half and becomes a bit too showoffy. Thats not the case here, here the story has been refashioned and rethought into a gritty tale of Irish cops and robbers in Boston. Its different enough to discourage comparisons, which is a good thing in these days of shot for shot remakes.Martin Scorsese has fashioned a really good film. The cast is mostly excellent, with only Jack Nicholson ruining things with an occasional lapse into stereotypical ""Jackisms"". Leonardo DiCaprio has at last arrived as an actor and turns in an excellent performance as the cop gone deep undercover. His performance is sure to garner an Oscar nomination.I really liked this film but I didn't love it. The film carries a sense of having been down this road before, not because its a remake, as I said it different enough to rebuke comparison, rather its because it takes the gangster films of the past thirty years and compresses them together and has a very familiar feel. It reminded me of several other films about the Irish mobs, State of Grace in particular, so it didn't strike me as ground breaking the way The Godfather or Goodfellas did upon first seeing them.My one real complaint with the film is that it takes too log to get where its going. Yes its tense and it keeps you on the edge of your seat but when it was over I felt as though I had been watching it for twice its length. A good movie should fly by and make you lose track of time. I was checking my watch through out much of the second half of this movie.Definitely worth seeing, but I'm not sure you're going to love it, so much as you're going to like it.7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The Departed is Scorsese's most overrated film.,"Now now, before you go and comment, dislike and lambast my opinion, hear me out. This is by no means a bad film, in fact it's better than good. Yet, a ludicrous amount of film aficionados deem this as one the best films from the last decade. I'm afraid I strongly disagree. An amateur Boston cop infiltrates an American Irish gang by following the chief mobster. On the flipside, a criminal from the gang infiltrates the police department and reports the status of the investigation back to the head honcho. It's a vintage crime story that thematically conveys the power of trust. Scorsese is back to what he does best, crafting intricate mafia crime thrillers fuelled by rich character development. The arcs of the leading individuals are fully realised and are played out like a methodical game of chess. Motives are shrouded in mystery, minds are tainted by corrupted ideologies. Scorsese brings in an A-list cast comprising of Damon, DiCaprio and the ever reliable Nicholson who essentially chews up every scene like he is devouring a piece of tender chicken. Monahan's screenplay consistently brings out the gritty Boston upbringing of these characters. It's a harsh environment that lures you into this convoluted world filled with rats and tyranny. Wahlberg's sarcastic banter was a much required element to what is a tough exterior. My reasoning for not rating this excruciatingly high is the narrative structure. There are no surprises in this, it's a ""thriller"" that doesn't excite me. Purposefully indicating who the informants are in both parties at the beginning means a large duration of the film becomes predictably unexciting. It's only at its conclusion that it mistakingly tries to be enthralling by shooting people in the head (literally!). Lazily underwhelming, especially after 140 minutes of character development. The Boston accents also came across extremely heavily from certain actors, particularly Farmiga as she exclaims ""harrrrrdest!"". A well constructed crime drama that unfortunately is weighted down by a mechanical narrative.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A terrific movie.,"A white knuckled crime thriller depicting the cat and mouse game of two cops, one an overworked and overstretched undercover and the other a two faced fa**ot rat holed up in the police department, trying to figure each other's identities out. Both are in too deep and thus will lose their lives if they're found out. So stakes are at an all time high, and they will run over anyone and anything to keep themselves hidden.Leonardo DiCaprio out of all the star studded cast in this flick impressed with his outstanding performance. He was anxiety ridden and dreadful of the uncertainty of his constantly fluxing situation. This is his best role so far, in my opinion. Leo truly morphed into his always unnerved and deeply depressed character. William hated the mob life he walked into, the god-awful mass murderering psychos he was hanging out with, the part where he wasn't able to be his real self, the loneliness of it all and him lacking a normal life. His only escapade was his shrink and even though all he got from her was pity love, she was his sole catharsis. That part was truly heart rending. His character felt all too real. Fantastic performance from Leo who made William Costigan Jr seem human.Matt Damon's portrayal of the deceitful and self serving nasty rat was also excellent. His hubris totally being crushed inside the elevator and seeing him beg to be killed was just funny and a clear display of Damon's broad acting range.Leo and Damon made this movie worth watching. Impressive performances from both.The Departed was a captivating and a truly nail biting experience. A well conceived, well written, well acted and an entertaining thriller that deserves it's popularity and top rating. Sad William Costigan Jr passed the way he did after all the agonizing hell he went through but at least he got avenged. Even though, that's no fulfilling, it gave the movie an acceptable ending. A terrific movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Departed is the best movie in recent memory,"I was somewhat taken aback by the power of this movie. While Godfather II is perhaps the best gangster movie of all time, this flick is a VERY close second. Moreover, it may very well be one of the best movies ever, and it ranks with Scorsese's best, including ""Raging Bull."" The cast was, simply, superb, and as I left the movie, I recounted who will win what Oscars....Scorsese is a lock for best director; the film will win best picture; but the acting awards will be more difficult to determine. Surely Jack Nicholson will win his umpteenth best actor award, and I would vote for DiCaprio for best supporting actor. DiCaprio might get a best actor nomination himself. I thought Mark Wahlberg was perfectly cast in his role as the liaison for the undercover cop. I will see this movie again to ensure that I haven't missed any nuances!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Need more like this,"I've watched these gangster or gangster-esque movies before; goodfellas, the godfather, training day, se7en, this one (the departed) etcetera etcetera but I was too young to appreciate them or remember so watching them again now and all I can think of is why don't they make movies like this anymore. I mean they try to.Usually when I see a cast lineup this good now first thought is ""I hope I don't get disappointed"", but in this movie the plot is just as good as the characters playing in it. And the end... often when a movie or series is full of twists and turns towards the end it's either too dramatic or just there to make up for a mediocre movie but it's perfect in this, watching this I can't think of a much better way to end it.Great actors, great directors and great writers came together in this. It's a simple cat and mouse, cops vs gangsters thriller and it's enticing without being too complicated. What I love most is the viewer knows everything that's going on and you're just waiting to see which character in the movie is gonna figure it out first. More often than not the writers always keep a trump card in the script and you only figure it when the characters involved do which is exciting, but it's nice to see a simple thriller that keeps you at the edge of your seat like this one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Entertaining but Nothing Spectacular,"For a movie over two hours long I felt like there was a lot missing. A lot of the story felt rushed while at other times it felt like it was dragging. The movie just seemed to fall flat despite all the talent assembled on the screen. I don't know if it was the dialog or all the plot holes (there are a lot of loose ends in my opinion).I just always felt like I had a lot of interesting characters but I kept asking myself as I watched this film - what the heck is going on? How much got lost on the cutting room floor? Maybe this film needed to be four hours.I would like to see an unedited unrated director's cut or read the original screenplay for this movie. It covers such a large span of time and seems to jump all over the place without neatly putting things together. And the end seems like a desperate attempt to close off as many open plot lines as possible.Entertaining, yet frustrating. I expected a lot more out of this film and I don't really feel like it delivered. I recommend waiting for DVD.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Making Decisions with a Gun Instead of a Gavel,"I am not saying that I think this movie is in the category with other Scorcese greats such as ""Raging Bull"" and ""Taxi Driver"", actually ""King of Comedy"" is my favorite Scorcese film, however ""The Departed"" is a relatively remarkable film!! The acting in this movie is simply incredible!! The plethora of acting talent simply overwhelms you!! Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, Jack Nicholson, Leonardo Di Caprio, and of course Matt Damon!! I thought Matt Damon's performance was the best acting performance in this movie!! The comment he made which I found to be very interesting was ""The Irish are impervious to psycho-analysis"".. I went to grade school at an Irish parish, and even though they were affluent, they did seem more visceral than many other ethnic groups are!! Boston is the only city in the country where the Irsih control the syndicate. The Italians are accustomed to ruling organized crime in virtually every other city in the United States. Boston is where the movie ""The Departed"" takes place.. The F word replaced a lot of semantics in this movie, and the violence seemed to have some kind of tenet of amelioration attached to it!! ""The Departed"" won for best picture in '2006, as it would appear as though the copious quantity of top notch talent in this film would almost mandate such an accolade!! How were all the problems in this movie solved?...WITH A GUN!! The violence in ""The Departed"" was almost satirical, as it signified a precarious set of checks and balances!! Everyone's anger seemed to reflect a sordid and justifiable pontification for everything!! Many techniques of agitation and vindictiveness with this movie told the movie audience one thing- This is a Scorcese film!! His style emanates a proverbial belligerence through frustration that he has incorporated in so many of his past movies!! I enjoyed this film, and I can definitely see how it won best picture in '2006. What is the best way of saying ""The Departed"" is an excellent movie, by saying this: ""The Departed"" is a really good (F word) picture!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Whom Do You Trust?,"Wow, this was exhausting. We have a cast of characters, each of which has a dangerous side. They are woven into a complex network of crime and honor. Some are spies; some are mobsters; some are weak; and some are strong. The one thing that fills the screen is no one knows when it's coming. There is so much danger out there and it could be around any corner. The performances are great, particular by Jack Nicholson and Mark Walberg. These are a couple of crazies who seem to enjoy the most insane, continuous process of interaction among crooks and police. They are suspicious and ruthless and absolutely great. The down side is having a hell of a lot of sympathy for anyone. Leonardo DeCaprio's character is probably the most sympathetic but we know the fine line he is walking and that disturbs us. There is so much graphic violence and disrespect for humanity that it's at times hard to like it. Still, it never stops, right up to it's dramatic finish.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Truculent Pancake,"What a shame. Scorcese, the old one, lived in a world that worked differently than the world of most folks. His world has no God, no laws, no fate, no environment. His world is a world of characters who exude the world. If there are apparent laws, it is because of the force of people creating the space they project into.He works in this way because its his heritage, an Italian legacy both in culture and film. And because it works. A filmmaker's job is to define a world in a film, ideally in the first few moments of a film. There are all sorts of ways to do this and the way we digest what we see has a lot to do with how it is served in this way.One way, the way the old Scorcese used, was to invest wholly in bodies. Focus the camera completely on people, a few very, very strong people, and grow the world and a whole world system  usually based on simple ethics  around it. It means you have the latitude to develop some loud, apparently full characters, but it also carries disadvantages: we never can fold his movies into our lives. We can never overlap our world into his, because his doesn't exist.He knows these limits. He's spoken of them privately, and in his last two films you could see him trying to outgrow the limits of the old Scorcese. With ""Gangs"" he reached far into space, defining places, a city, underground havens, mobs, the flow of rumors through society. He reached to groups. His camera flew, not as expertly as DePalma's but wildly compared to old filmmaker's which was tethered to single bodies. ""Gangs"" overreached and ran out of money, time and the patience of his patrons, so it was wrapped up with some explosive characters.""Aviator"" showed us a new man. I hailed him as the best new filmmaker of that year. He drifted into the world, away from characters. He designated a watcher in Blanchett, something he has never done before, and he let he bring her tools of folded narrative to bear. It was film worth watching, his first one in my opinion.And now we have the old fellow backsliding into his easy manner, his cheat. His way of delivering apparent power with no power. Yes, it is well put together. Yes, it has serious actors doing their bit without worrying about how it fits in the symphony. There is no grand design, just speechifying. Yes, the use of music is perhaps the most competent you will ever find.But it is empty. Again. We lost a filmmaker this year.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Scorsese at his best,"I've just been binge watching the Scorsese movies for the first time recently have yet to seen taxi driver as the considerable one I've missed but pretty much all his other ""famous"" flicks, I've watched very recently.
I completely understand why people say goodfellas is his best film and I do love that film but this is truly special. Not only is the acting and directing phenomenal but I believe this film has slightly better pacing compared to Irishman or even king of comedy. I think this has the best ending to any of his work and I think mark wahlberg gives a very underrated supporting performance. Overall I think this is one of the best films of the 2000s and is truly a cinematic masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Not Marty's Best.....But Better Than Most's Best!!!!,"A really good old fashioned film, with an excellent story and an unbelievable cast. This film really keeps you interested all the way though as you want to know what will happen to the protagonists, and how they will or won't get caught.We have all seen All-Star cast films where they just did not gel, but Marty seems to have got a good performance out of everybody. You can tell that Jack Nicholson has been given huge leeway in how he wanted to take his character through the story, and as always seems larger than life, but do not mistake that for a recycled performance. Without giving nothing away, his meeting with Matt Damon in the cinema is certainly worth watching for novelty and imagination in introducing yourself to someone you know!!! This is the sort of film you come out of the theatre with a big smile on your face, and surrounded by good spirited chattering. There are twists but you do not lose track of events, and just lap up the quality that laces the film from beginning to end.Sure it is not Goodfellas, but then they say that genius only touches you once....but this is head and shoulders above the best that most other directors can make.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The Departed (2006) Scorsese's most overrated film?,"Among so many incredible films in Scorsese's filmography, only one of them won the Oscar for best film and that was The Departed. However, in my opinion, this is far from being the best film of his career and, although it is not bad, it is far from being excellent. His direction is great, he manages to develop perfect scenes throughout the entire plot and some very different details. These different details are pleasing at certain times, however, at others it seems tacky. I don't like the look, it's one of the ugliest films in Scorsese's career. The story is interesting and the characters are well developed, but it starts to get a better rhythm only in the final hour.

Even tho the movie is a remake Martin sure picked a great one to remake bcuz the original Hong Kong flick (Infernal Affairs) was good as well it's just that Scorsese had Americanized it.

A Perfect Blend Of Vintage and Contemporary Scorsese,"The Departed is a great film to say the least. The film centers around an entire police department's chase of a top boss in Boston. The plot may not seem original but the film gives you a feeling of something new with the intensity of that of a drama and the awe of an action flick.The acting of the cast all around is great with the likes of actors such as Leonardo Dicaprio playing a rookie cop getting his first assignment. As a result of his family's history of criminal activity his first job is to be working undercover gathering intelligence in the dealings of a mob boss played different yet brilliantly by Jack Nicholson. This goes without notice as Nicholson has his man on the inside as well. On the opposite side of the spectrum Matt Damon also plays a rookie cop starting out of the box with a good job though as a result of his honorable family history. There also plenty of great supporting performances by Martin Sheen and Ray Winestone as well as a breakout performance given by Mark Wahlberg.Despite so many explosive performances this film is driven by its story so perfectly directed by Martin Scorsese. With this film Scorsese uses his skill to show the hard and gritty tough life on the streets as he once did so often as well as his fine attention to detail with amazing plot dynamics. What both of these things culminate into is a well rounded and balanced film with an unlimited scope of cops and gangsters. The depth of the film is limitless as it is so well layered. Scorsese here makes the film of his life here throwing out everything he has. Scorsese and William Monahan, who so adapts this film so vividly, combine for one of the most thrilling and psychologically explosive movies in ages as the film so perfectly illustrates nothing is as it seems as well as a chain is only as strong as strong as its weakest link.

Remakes are seldom as good as the original,"I started my day with 2046. I won't recommend that film to any but fans of Tony Leung (Mou gaan dou, Ying xiong), Li Gong (Miami Vice, Memoirs of a Geisha) and Ziyi Zhang Memoirs of a Geisha, Ying xiong). The music was excellent and Tony Leung's performance was spellbinding, but the movie was hard to follow.I only mention Tony Leung because his performance in Mou gaan dou was on my mind as I watched The Departed, which is a remake of that film. I wish I had a copy with me to watch again and remind me of why it is such a favorite, but I have seen it enough times to know that it still stand above the new version.I just couldn't wait any longer, so I bought my copy yesterday and sat down with some chips to watch. Leonardo DiCaprio was magnificent. I have never been a big fan of Leonardo. I really liked him in Gangs of New York and Catch Me If You Can, but this performance was over the top. Having said that, I can't really think of another character's performance in The Departed that is worth mentioning. It ran 50 minutes longer than Mou gaan dou and the extra time was really a waste as it did not add anything to the film. The setup in the beginning was really a bore. Scorcese did so much better work in Gangs of New York and Goodfellas, one of my favorite films. I really don't see him winning an Oscar for this film, though they will probably give it to him for ignoring his earlier and better work.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Not as good as the original,"I know that it is not difficult to say that in every remake's case, but this one really got my hopes high. Unfortunately, it wasn't the case this time. Don't get me wrong, the movie is still great, it just falls below expectation. Yes, Di Caprio is great for the first time (he was good in some movies before, but here he is just superb). Nicholoson - is over the top, being 69 years old he is still much more charismatic and believable than his young rivals. The rest of the cast is just good, no flaws.Whenever they tried to stick to the original - everything worked great. For some unfortunate reason they decided to over-complicate already sophisticated screenplay - and spoiled it. There are some unnecessary characters creating the mess, some FBI storyline in the movie that only God knows what that was intended for. And also the ending - I do not know, ending in the Hong-Kong movie was reasonable and understandable, here it is basically the same - but messy. In the original all of the characters had very clear reasons for everything they did, and they lost it here.My biggest problem with that one is that in the original neither one of the main 2 characters was either complete bastard or saint - and here they actually made it black and white.And no, don't forget about Taxi Driver:) this one is very good (especially if you have not seen the original), but not great.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Scorsese Scores Again!,"Another score for Scorsese with this all-star cast in The Departed. The Departed is loosely based on the real-life Whitey Bulger and the Boston Winter Hill gang. Jack Nicholson delivers one of his best performances yet as crime boss Frank Costello. Leonardo DiCaprio also delivers another outstanding performance as William Costigan Jr. An undercover cop who joins Costello's (Nicholson) crew in an attempt to bring down Costello for the many crimes committed throughout the Boston area. Matt Damon stars as Collin Sullivan a dirty cop who was mentored by Costello and joins the Boston Police Department to help further his criminal activity. This is a wild ride from beginning to end filled with cops, crooks, moles and rats.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Pretty much perfect,"I'm not a massive fan of either Leo DiCaprio or Matt Damon but this movie has to be up there with their best in my view. Both playing up and coming cops in Boston, their lives are intertwined in ways neither realises.Nicholson is superbly cast as Irish mobster Frank Costello, as are Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg as the cops tasked with catching him.Featuring some great turns by supporting cast members Ray Winstone, Vera Farmiga, Alec Baldwin and James Badge Dale.The movie has more twists and turns than a rat would take up a drain-pipe, and the soundtrack is great featuring the likes of the Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd and Boston locals, The Dropkick Murphys.Definitely, definitely worth a watch!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Goated,I don't care what anyone says but this is one of the best movies ever. Leonardo di'caprio pulls off an S tier performance but in my opinion the best performance is Mark Wallberg this movie made his career and gave the movie lot's of depth and tention another great performance is Jack Nickleson even at his age he still brings a sublime performance.My only anger with this movie is Matt Damion because his acting was slightly 1 dimensional which I am sure is not his fault but did disappoint me a bit.,9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Very good movie,"The Departed is a gripping crime thriller and a remake of the 2002 Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs. Set in Boston, the film weaves a complex narrative of undercover operations and double lives.The story centers on two moles: Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), an undercover cop infiltrating the mob led by the notorious Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), and Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), a corrupt police officer who is secretly working for Costello. As both men navigate their dangerous double lives, the tension escalates as their paths inevitably cross, leading to a high-stakes game of cat and mouse.Scorsese's direction is sharp and intense, and the film is praised for its tight screenplay, intricate plot twists, and strong performances from its cast. Nicholson's portrayal of the manipulative mob boss adds a menacing edge to the film, while DiCaprio and Damon deliver compelling performances as the conflicted protagonists.The Departed explores themes of identity, loyalty, and deception, and is known for its suspenseful narrative and memorable dialogue. The film won several Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, cementing its place as a modern classic in the crime genre.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Love It When a Plan Comes Together,"Yea that's right, I made an A-Team reference regarding The Departed. Despite the quality differences between these media stories, this film went exactly as planned. So when Brad Pitt and his production company Plan B decided to help remake a Chinese classic, they decided to go all out. Aside from getting the great Martin Scorsese on board to direct and William Monahan to write an excellent script, they felt like it wasn't enough. They hired Leo and an All-Star cast that could only be matched by a corny romantic comedy (Valentine's Day). Then as they say, the rest worked out itself. The acting was superb with Leo leading the way along with Mark Wahlberg, Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson not far behind. Not to mention the ten other actors who did their jobs well and when it was all said and done. Mr. Scorsese didn't get denied and he finally won his Oscar. Plus he found his new De Niro with Leo and with this and Shutter Island, the future looks bright as long as Scorsese is still kicking.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Overused,"The Departed is an overused concept we have seen in so many films before. If it weren't for great performances by Dicaprio, Nicholsen, even Wahlberg and a few twists that were shocking this film would be boring. The departed was a disappointment but it had a few moments that kept it interesting. I still recommend you watch it but it's not great.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Gritty and Intense!,"The Departed is a gritty, intense crime thriller that expertly delves into the morally ambiguous world of undercover agents. Martin Scorsese's masterful direction, coupled with a stellar cast, delivers a gripping narrative of betrayal, loyalty, and the blurring lines between good and evil.Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon give powerhouse performances as two cops-turned-criminals, each caught in a deadly game of cat and mouse. Jack Nicholson's menacing portrayal of the ruthless mob boss, Frank Costello, adds an extra layer of intensity to the film.

"One of the most overrated films of all time, but hey... when you got star power like this film had, who would dare say a bad thing about you?","*Note: This film has too many big named actors for me to list them according to their roles. There is a such a plethora of characters in this film that they start to blur so I'm only going to refer to character names for ease sake. Actors you may recognize: DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Vera Farmiga, Alec BaldwinSynopsis: In the beginning of the film we are introduced through montage and monologue to Frank Costello, the ruthless crime lord of South Boston. He preaches about power, grabbing life by the reigns, and about his general philosophy of the similarities between cops and criminals.Next we are then thrown into another montage of Colin Sullivan and Billy Costigan, young cadets going through the police academy. After they graduate we see that Colin is a straight- A, climb the ranks kind of officer but also a double agent working for Frank. Billy on the other hand wants nothing more than to serve. However as a man whose family history is littered with low life criminals he is stuck feeling a bit out of place. Noticeably the black- sheep of his family Billy is given a super secret top mission to fail out the ""Staties"" and instead work undercover infiltrating Frank's gang. Billy thinks long and hard about his decision but in the end is persuaded by the father-like figure Captain Queenan.After a 20 minute long intro, the movie begins as the two undercover operatives work on separate sides, doing their best to conceal their dual identities. In doing so there lives begin to morph and derange to the point they don't know if they're more cop or criminal.The story is less to do with a singular event and more to do with when the two will be found out and gutted. There is a thing about some military microchips being sold to the Chinese but that story abruptly ends mid-movie. The driving force of the movie is more about how Colin and Billy must maneuver, bluff, and lie their way out of trouble. Both sides suspect a double agent among their ranks which increases the tension.Madolyn is the on sight psychologist and while getting into a serious relationship with Colin she starts develop an attachment to Billy as their mandatory therapy sessions bring them closer.Review: First of all this movie is almost 3 hours long! No movie should ever be that long unless it contains elements of fantasy or sci-fi. This film has so many stars and characters that instead of choosing who to focus on, Scorsese gives screen time to EVERYONE. It excessively gives moments of emotional development to Frank and Madolyn. Yes, Jack Nicholson plays a cool bad guy but he acts almost like a narrator spitting diatribe after another about cops, foreigners , and every other social intuition on the planet. Why in a movie that has to deal with identity and suspense is there so much ""other stuff"" added? There are themes about church, race relations, and about settling in your romantic life. All things that are great and interesting but simply should have been set aside for another movie.The cinematography is nothing special and in fact can be distracting at times, best example is when Billy is being grilled by Wahlberg for his intent on making the force. The camera gets a little movement happy constantly closing in on heads while they talk. Although this film won for best editing I have to forcefully disagree with that recognition. The film is adequately edited but in no way is the editing outstanding. A well edited film has great pace, which this film struggles with in its entirety. It's a stop and go viewing experience with scenes ranging from a couple of seconds to five minutes. Maybe it was purposely done that way to keep the audiences awake, but you shouldn't have to sacrifice flow for attention. Otherwise you're simply shaking the viewer to pay attention instead of enrapturing them.The acting is pretty good but none of the performances other than Wahlberg's is something new. DiCaprio mannerisms continues to be the same in almost everyone movie and only different thing about Matt Damon's performance is his accent.The Departed is an American remake of the Hong Kong trilogy Infernal Affairs, which is probably why I am being harder on this film than usual. Also the premise of dual undercover characters has been done before the action film Face-Off so I don't understand all the buzz this film has gotten. Scorsese was a frontier shattering director and I loved his work in Raging Bull and Taxi Driver. However The Departed is far from ground breaking cinema and the clearest example I know of success by name.Who this film is not for:-People who don't like gangster/cop films-People with short attention spans",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Nice Movie In Time,"Performances: The performances in The Departed are exceptional. Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a raw and emotional portrayal of Costigan, capturing his internal struggle and fear with remarkable depth. Matt Damon provides a nuanced performance as Sullivan, portraying his character's duplicity with subtlety and skill. Jack Nicholson's performance as Frank Costello is both charismatic and terrifying, adding a volatile energy to the film. The supporting cast, including Mark Wahlberg, Vera Farmiga, and Alec Baldwin, contribute significantly to the film's impact, each bringing their own strengths to the ensemble.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Scorsese Classic,"This is as great of a movie as you can get. Undoubtedly, it is one of the most complete movies of the 2000s. The story-line is engaging, breathtaking, and genius. The cinematography is what you would expect from an Scorsese movie, and directing is top notch. It won the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Directing, Best Writing, and Best Editing to back that claim. Then comes the cast of absolute all-stars. DiCaprio, Damon, Nicholson, Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, and Baldwin. In today's movies, it seems like every time too many starts are placed in a movie, it backfires, but not in a Scorsese movie. DiCaprio delivered an Oscar-deserving performance, and was absolutely robbed by the Academy. Nicholson once again proved to everyone why he is one of the best actors of all time, as if anyone would disagree. Damon was great, although he struggled a bit to establish himself in accordance to his character's personality, however, he was able to pull it off one way or another and complete the story. Whalberg was as usual his own self, and somehow his personality translated perfectly to his character. Overall, it was a great all around effort by every actor in the movie, even those who didn't receive much screen time to prove that the casting was flawless. The story developed well, providing the essential back-story and taking the time to develop each character thoroughly. Although it seemed as if the ending was slightly rushed (even though this was a two and a half hour movie), the climax with all its plot twists unfolded as smoothly as the director intended. This is a must see movie for any fan of Crime/Drama/Thriller movies. It is also captures some of the best performances by all the main actors, whose fans can not go on without watching.-apologies for not putting the time to proof read this review.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

This is an all-time great picture that is an absolute must see,"The Departed (2006) is a movie that is in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows two young men who grew up on the mean streets of Boston with troubled pasts and shady associates. They both register for the police academy and have two different experiences with one being put on the fast track to promotion and leadership and the other being dragged through the mud, sent to jail and placed on a secret undercover mission. As they head in opposite directions their paths are bound to cross again...This movie is directed by Martin Scorsese (Casino) and stars
Leonardo DiCaprio (What's Eating Gilbert Grape), Matt Damon (Goodwill Hunting), Jack Nicholson (The Shining), Martin Sheen (Apocalypse Now), Anthony Anderson (Hot Tub Time Machine) and Alec Baldwin (It's Complicated).The cast for this picture is absolutely amazing and everyone delivers a tremendous performance. This is likely one of the greatest casts ever assembled. The storyline and script is perfectly written. The back story of each character is perfectly developed, the dialogue illustrated the knots inside the characters and how the inner demons impact their decisions and direction. Nicholson is a perfect villain, and his cunning and ruthlessness is entertaining in itself. The narration is legendary, and the ending is both shocking and rewarding.Overall, this is an all time great picture that is an absolute must see.

Still pretty great 18 years later.,"This is one of those movies I sometimes fear I'll grow out of, but it never seems to happen. The characters say some things in The Departed that I don't think would be written into a screenplay today, but it otherwise holds up incredibly well. And you can acknowledge the dialogue, to some extent, being critical of overly macho meat heads. Martin Sheen's clean-cut character never says anything terrible, after all (from memory).I generally like the way it expands the tighter (and arguably more stylish) Infernal Affairs and lets the actors go nuts with some big, broad, beefy material here. It does feel like this would've been a strangely fun movie to make, which is humorously at odds with the way most of the characters in this seem to be having a pretty terrible time (Jack Nicholson's Frank aside).This movie is like watching the preparation and then knocking over of dominoes for two and a half hours, all edited magnificently and presented bombastically. I think this is Martin Scorsese at his most crowd-pleasing, and it's a testament to his skills that he can make something this accessible while still making sure it all feel like a Scorsese film. I love seeing a movie balance a bunch of unlikely things at once and The Departed does just that. And it's pretty relentless for the most part, with very few parts that even come close to feeling slow.It's the sort of movie that's never quite as fun the second time around (once you know where everything's going and can no longer be shocked), but it's still a fun ride of a movie worth revisiting every now and then. It's not one of the director's very best films, but it's better than most other director's very best film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Scorsese does it again,"'The Departed' is an American crime-thriller film directed by Martin Scorsese ('Taxi Driver', 'Good Fellas'). The film gives us a poignant look at a fictional war on drugs fought by the Boston Police Department against an Irish-rooted mob led by Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), with his protégé, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) helping him from the inside of the police force while Billy Costigan (Leonardo Di Caprio) helps the police department by infiltrating Costello's mob.The story takes place in Boston, following the lives of Billy Costigan, an undercover cop of the Boston Police Department, who is at a crossroads in his life, having just lost all close relatives and with no clear direction in his life, as he infiltrates Costello's mob, and Colin Sullivan, who from a very young age has been the protégé of Costello and who now works for the Boston Police Department, providing Frank with information. As the story unfolds, we see the consequences the characters have to deal with by leading a double life. We watch them as they blur the lines of what's right or wrong, and we get to see just how far they are willing to go to protect what they've built, and to get what they want.In typical Scorsese fashion, the director dwells into the moral aspect of their characters, exploring the kind side of the villain and the dark side of the heroes. The cast is on point through-out all the movie, with the performances by Leonardo Di Caprio, Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg being particularly fascinating.One of the strongest points of the film it's is pace, with the story developing in a fast-pace, leaving no dead-time on screen for the viewer to lose attention. One major critic of the film is that it doesn't follow the original, Infernal Affairs, too closely. While this may be true to some extent, it could very well be attributed to the fact that the original is a three-part saga; it's a given that some of the story it's bound to be lost in the process of condensing three movies into one.While it released more than twenty years into the career of director Scorsese, 'The Departed' is a solid film, with a story that will keep you at the edge of your seat, that's going to keep you guessing as of what's going to happen next. If you're in the mood for a film with a fast-paced, thrilling story, fleshed-out characters and superb acting, then 'The Departed' is a must-see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
In hindsight- basically a masterpiece,"I didn't see this in cinemas when it came out, but I've watched it many times since then. And as it got the Oscar, people denigrated it and said it was Scorsese's worst film (at the time). I never agreed with that.One thing is for sure, this film is starting to look more and more like a masterpiece as time goes on, while at the same time the quality of films in the streaming era just continues to plummet.I'm not going to bother going into the various things this film does well, but sufficed to say you could do a lot worse than watch this for the 3rd.. 6th.. 10th time. It's such a great ride, I love it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
As Good As It Gets,"Martin Scorsese, perhaps the greatest American film director of all- time, delivers in a major way with The Departed. The movie represents a return to the material that made him a superstar in the first place. And the result is one of the best American crime dramas ever made. Aided by a brilliant script (William Monahan), and an outstanding ensemble cast, Scorsese is in top form here. It should be noted that The Departed is technically a remake of the Chinese action hit, Infernal Affairs, unseen by me. It also uses the true story of infamous Boston mobster Whitey Bulger as a template for the Jack Nicholson character. But I think it would do the film and the viewer a disservice to think of it as a Bulger picture. It is not. It is its own story with its own characters that stands on its own. The film opens with a young Matt Damon in a local diner, listening to Nicholson's notorious local gangster spouting off in his own poetically vulgar way about how cops and crooks aren't so different. Instant flash forward to the future, and Damon's character is being sworn in as a Massachusetts state police officer. Meanwhile, so is another character, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. We learn that Leo's character comes from a family with an unsavory, non-law-abiding past. He's confronted by his superior, Martin Sheen, and his sidekick, Mark Wahlberg. Wahlberg might be the single most enjoyable aspect of the film, which is saying a lot. He steals nearly every scene he's in as a foul-mouthed, results-driven hothead. They present Leo's character with an ultimatum: quit the force, or join their undercover operation as a mole in Jack's gang. It's a risky proposition, but one they all know is feasible, including Leo. On paper, he'll quit the force and get back into crime, including an assault conviction and a short jail sentence. Then work his way into the Nicholson character's world. At the same time, Damon's character has been handpicked to run a top secret task force out to snag Jack once and for all. But it appears he's still in Jack's debt. One cop who's really a gangster pretending to be a cop, and another who's really a cop pretending to be a gangster. What unfolds is an epic, wholly believable and ultimately satisfying tale about just how thin the line between good and bad can be. It's difficult to overstate the quality of the acting performances in this film. DiCaprio is incredible as a vulnerable savant looking for some sort of salvation, spending his spare time sitting next to a hospital bed occupied by his dying mother. Damon delivers a strong performance as the wormy overachiever who says all the right things and shacks up with the department's psychiatrist (Vera Farmiga in a very effective performance). Alec Baldwin has some great lines in a small but solid role as one of the squad commanders. Sheen is perfect as the wise and cautious bureau chief (or something like that). When Scorsese has material like this, as in Goodfellas or Taxi Driver or Raging Bull or Mean Streets, its as if he's transported to another time and place that allows him to tell the story with an impeccable sense for placement, color, angle, emphasis, and tone. It's like watching Michael Jordan or Jimi Hendrix. It's a special thing when an artist has such control over their craft. If you're the sort of person who likes a well-written, impeccably acted crime drama, and for some inexplicable reason have not seen this movie, do yourself a favor and see it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Scorsese at his true best,The cast in this film speaks for itself. DiCaprio and Matt Damon give such a compelling performance and showcase the corruption of the police force. The film manages to also include 3 or 4 twists in places you do not expect and this shows the courage and confidence that Scorsese has as a director. The film is bold and gruesome but is told in such an intriguing way. Jack Nicholson and Ray Winstone are both great and entertain their roles superbly. However i believe that the best actor in this movie is Mark Wahlberg and his role in the film becomes the most important.,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Scorsese's Boston gangster opera,"Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) is a Boston Irish mobster. He mentors Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) ever since as a little kid. Eventually Colin joins the Special Investigation Unit in the State Police headed by Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen) and the unpleasant Staff Sergeant Dignam (Mark Wahlberg). He works directly under Captain Ellerby (Alec Baldwin). He begins a relationship with police psychiatrist Madolyn Madden (Vera Farmiga). Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a new police recruit from a family of lowlife criminals. Queenan and Dignam put him undercover. After serving some time in prison, he works with his petty criminal cousin Sean (Kevin Corrigan) and catches the eye of Sullivan's henchman Mr. French (Ray Winstone).Director Martin Scorsese goes to Boston to film this gangster opera. The cast is second to none. There is great acting being done here. Leo is terrific holding up even against the peacock acting of Nicholson. Winstone is powerfully rough. Damon is twisting his sweet persona into something a bit more of a douche. There is a bit too much plot and sometimes, the movie tries to do too many things. For example, Scorsese doesn't need some of the camera moves or the back and forth editing which only distracts from staying with the plot. It may work even better with a simplified style. This movie is best at its bloody brutal core especially with Leo acting up a storm.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Very good but not Scorseses' best,"Film takes place in Boston. It deals with two men (Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon) who are both working to bring down a crime lord (Jack Nicholson). Problem is they're both working for different agencies and neither knows about the other. Things quickly go out of control.OK--this is not Martin Scorsese's best film. That goes to ""Raging Bull"" and ""Good Fellas"". However it is one of his best. The plot has many twists and turns and surprises I didn't see coming. There's excellent use of music throughout and Scorsese really manages to capture the mood and feeling of Boston (not easy to do). Also--since this is a Scorsese film--the word ""f***"" is used a few hundred times and the violence is VERY extreme and bloody. This isn't for weak stomaches. My only complaints here are that the movie is too long--it has one climax too many and some lousy acting lessens it. DiCaprio is excellent in his role. I was very impressed--I never thought much of him as an actor but now I've changed my opinion. Nicholson, Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen are good too. Vera Farmiga holds her own in a male dominated cast. But Matt Damon is a blank in one of the main roles. His face never changes expression and I didn't know how to take him. Mark Wahlberg is bad too. How he got an Academy Award nomination for this I'll never know. He's as blank as Damon and just swears non stop for no reason and keeps giving obscene finger gestures. I was just hoping somebody would kill him off soon. He wasn't playing a character--he was doing a caricature. Those two bad performances lessen this. Also some of the cast fake Boston accents pretty well (Damon and Wahlberg are from the area so they didn't have to fake it).It got Best Picture and Best Director Academy Awards because Martin Scorsese was long overdue for both. So--it is worth seeing but not Scorsese's best by a long shot. I give it an 8.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Tight, intense thriller","The best cast of the year 2007 makes this Americanized adaptation of an original Hong Kong film (Internal Affairs) shine. William Monahan's adapted screenplay has been nominated for an Academy Award, the film is nominated for best picture, Scorsese for best director, and there are a couple other nominations out - somewhat inexplicably including Mark Wahlburg for supporting actor for his roles in this film. Wahlburg's performance, though excellent, is really little more than a cameo, and he has actually done better work (e.g. his roles in The Yards and Perfect Storm). But the Academy won't give him an Oscar for this, especially since he is up against a few Academy favorites and a veteran (Arkin). While I do not think this is Scorsese's best film, nor the best film of the year, it is one of the finest serious crime thrillers I have seen in a very long time.The film is set in Boston, and relies on stereotypes of that city and its ethnic groups that only slightly detract from the film's believability. Despite the fertile ground for psychological examination, the film's slightly absurd pace (DiCaprio becomes a trusted confidant of a crime boss in 3-4months???) the film is not a character study, and, rather, relies on archetypes of good cop/bad cop which are employed pretty consistently and to varying degrees throughout the film.Leonardo DiCaprio gives a performance that exceeds his own high standards, opposite Matt Damon in a life and death cat and mouse game. DiCaprio is undercover for the police infiltrating organized crime, Damon is undercover for an organized crime boss (Nicholson) infiltrating the police. Vera Farmiga is excellent as the police psychologist who ends up connected to both. Damon also gives a nice, edgy, though a little detached performance, and stalwarts Nicholson, Baldwin and Sheen do some of their best work in years. The Boston accents only occasionally slip into exaggeration (and surprisingly - are only over-done by actors who have lived in Boston!).The acting is generally outstanding. The cinematography is above average - there are too many straight pans and rhythmic fast cuts, but the action is always well framed and nicely emphasized by the camera. The direction is, as with most Scorsese work, tight, economical and clean. The script is excellent, and, in my opinion, is likely to give Babel a run for its money for the adapted screenplay Oscar. Contrary to some opinions I have seen here, I did not feel that the soundtrack added much to the film. In fact, if I were to fault the film for anything it would be sound.Excellent film, well worth seeing if you can handle the nihilism and violence it portrays.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Infernal Affairs Please..!,"Stylish, Exciting, Thrilling, ORIGINAL..! Oh Sorry I'm talking about Infernal Affairs! So you already know now that I do not feel positive about this remake. This isn't the standard expected from the guy who we loved after Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Casino & GOOD FELLA's... All I will say is the film just attach's clustered elements of the original. The characters psychology is seriously weak compared to 'IA' but even if we do not compare the 2, The Departed just doesn't make much sense and is (I really am choosing my words carefully here) LAZY! Who, What, Where, When, Why? There is too much talking, too much unnecessary scenarios, too much confusion on the characters - the film dived straight into the characters and not revealing why Damon becomes a cop! Things just happen in this film. There is no sense of compassion towards DiCaprio unlike Tony Leungs portrayal. I really respect Andy Lau, he was very polite to rate this boring 2hr+ film 8 out of 10.. The only thing he did comment on was the character psychology.. Now I know why! *Sometimes you don't need to try so hard to be effective* As Infernal Affairs was effortlessly cool. Departed , even with Jack Nicholson is just Painfully Bad!

"What happens to rats trying to ""out-rat"" each other?","A good guy, playing the bad guy, or a bad guy, playing the good guy - who will prevail in a standoff like this? The answers (sort of) lie within this movie, though the narrative is more about them trying to ""out-rat"" each other. What did that lead to? Well, more casualties than anyone could expect, for one. It also resulted in a lot of hurt feelings. Finally, we were left with an ending that leaves quite a lot of questions, even though by that point we had almost all of the answers. If there's a message that this movie tried to deliver, I'd guess it would sound something like ""being a rat doesn't lead to any good"". Seeing the rat in the final shot also gives a similar impression.I don't know why but the ending was pretty blank for me. After losing one of the key characters, it started going downhill. It just felt like that meme when someone is aiming a gun at the person in front of them, while also having a gun pointed at themselves from the back and the guy in the back is also in the scope of the 4th person, getting ready to shoot him from the rafters. Rats were trying to keep their head above water, sacrificing other rats in the process, while someone from above tried to drown them all. The problem here is that all the rats only showed up when water began running from the faucet and that ""someone from above"" was absent. To explain it using a different metaphor - the movie was like a lit cigarette that required harder and more rushed breaths to finish. The twists didn't feel like twists because some of the characters involved in them were so minor and insignificant. The way it collapsed on itself was a bit of a letdown.Even though I didn't like how the final chapter unfolded, I can't say that about the rest of the movie. There were a lot of ups and downs that worked in favor of the rat in the gang or the rat in the special force. The central piece somehow ended up being a psychiatrist, who got involved with both of the rats. It's both a pity and a blessing that neither of them realized that they had their eyes on the same woman. I feel like her part in the story is monumental for both of the rats. Another key character that was monumental to both of these guys is Staff Sergeant Dignam. In a way, he's the secondary true protagonist in the story only made it clear in the end but throughout the movie, he's being a pest to both of the rats. By a pest, I mean he's a hard head that questions both of their intentions and he got into a fight with both of them. His choice of words when confronting them is entertaining as he cusses them out in ways a stereotypical cop with a short temper would but he does it a bit better. It's just too bad that his screen time was pretty much limited, though maybe more input from him would begin to get tiresome. What's worse is that he turned into a ghost for a good portion at the end of the movie. Like his reintroduction just barely made any sense for me. Just like what was in the psychiatrists' package that didn't get another mention. Though it probably is what led to Dinam reappearing, at least that's my guess, I just feel it wasn't explored enough.Overall, I liked the movie, even though the majority of my ramblings were about what I didn't like or didn't get. Hey, just a friendly reminder, if I didn't get it, it doesn't mean it's bad or it's wrong, there's always a possibility that I might have missed a thing or two. And I don't want those few scenes that I didn't like towards the latter end of the movie to speak for my whole impression of the movie. I guess that Scorsese's style and the formula he uses in his movies are just beginning to look a bit old for me and I find myself being less impressed with every movie of his that I watch. That may not be it but it's a thought that I'm beginning to have in my head. It's a movie that I'll need to rewatch again sometime under a different set of circumstances. Maybe I'll find it better then, maybe I'll find it worse but I'll likely feel about the same.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Good, but Overrated","From what I had heard, The Departed was supposed to be an amazing flick, but it really ended up being just a little above average. I was one of the big supporters of the film at the beginning. I had people all around saying, ""That looks so bad,"" but I knew it looked like a great movie. How can you possibly go wrong with a cast consisting of Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nickolson, and Mark Wahlberg? First off, the performances were probably what made this movie. If not for the sensational acting, The Departed just would not be worth watching. Leonardo was great as the lead, and Jack Nickolson was classic as the crime boss. Matt Damon was good, but he didn't really play that big of a part until the very end. However, the performance that really stood out here was that of Mark Wahlberg. He REALLY proved he can act here with an incredibly memorable character.The plot felt like something new, and I was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie. However, I had many issues with the film. For one, the ending made me want to throw up. One of the worst endings to a film I've ever seen! Secondly, there were just too many plot elements that were left wide open and many things that were never given any explanation whatsoever.The Departed was good, but if you want to see an amazing crime movie, stick with Alpha Dog. Alpha Dog is underrated, so you won't really know what to expect.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Good, but it lack the resonance of Scorsese's more notable works.","I watched The Departed the day after it's general release. While watching, I tried to set aside thoughts of the move it's a remake of, Infernal Affairs, aside to be able to assess the movie clearly. Now, I haven't seen Infernal Affairs in a while, so this wasn't too hard to do, however, since I was privy to plot foreknowledge, nothing was all too surprising.Since I'd lived in Boston for three years, it was quite a treat to get to see that city again (well, some of it wasn't Boston, but enough of it was). The presence of the Yankee accent was okay, although I honestly wished that some of the less successful users had just gone without the accent altogether, because having it come and go sort of dropped me out of believability at times. There are enough long-time Boston natives that don't have it, that it wouldn't be weird for someone to lack the accent.Almost all of the performances were overwhelmingly solid. At times Nicholson and Baldwin seemed to go a little too over-the-top, but it was forgivable. The direction was canny, careful and generally nuanced. Scorsese has always been an able director of actors and pulled out performances and matched it with an eye for visual that's both invisible, yet entirely specific at the same time.I did have some issues with the film. First of all, Nicholson's character got too much screen time. He's not the emotional center of the film and a lot of what we see of him throughout the film may do a fine job of characterizing him as a badass devil-man, but we get that at the start. We need to focus on DiCaprio and Damon's characters and their stories (they are the centerpoint to the film); adding in all this excess Jack actually detracts from the film. The film's already a little bloated, running 2.5 hours, so a little chopping of extraneous scenes would've been good.The ending was another problem. It all came a little too fast and was a little ridiculous--causing the audience to burst out in laughter--when Scorsese should've taken a little care to lead the emotions to that point. And then there's also the groan-inducing last shot--that really just took the ridiculousness of the end over the top.So, what needed to be done to the ending? More attention needed to be paid to the moles. Towards the end of the film, DiCaprio's Billy comes across as wanting out so much that there's little motive for him to do what he does. The lack of motive leads to a lack of believability. I think focusing a little more on Billy and how the life of crime is breaking him down would've helped the drama, especially towards the end. This also goes for Damon's Colin. The impact of the life of being a good guy on his life really should've played a bigger impact. The events towards the end partially don't make sense because there's not enough motive for him to do what he does with Jack's Costello. Since his characterization breaks down towards the end, the finale just doesn't have a whole lot of resonance.This movie really needed to be more about these two characters, even with the intricate plot. That's where the core of the drama should've been focused, but the attention of the film was spread too thin to allow the end to be convincing.Now I'm going to start comparing with Infernal Affairs:* The encapsulation of the two female characters from Infernal Affairs into one had a lot of potential. In IA, the female characters seemed less whole. Unfortunately, the Departed doesn't give her enough attention to pull any real drama. This is made worse by some cheap dramatics thrown in via a photograph and made a little ridiculous by the change in relationship between her and Billy, which wasn't really believable based on her characterization.* Although I liked Walhberg's performance, his character wasn't necessary. The only reason for Dignam to even exist is to create the American ending. This is where Infernal Affairs manages to get it better. It better crafts a relationship between Leung's Chan (DiCaprio's Billy) and his police boss--the boss is the only one who knows and so when the later events occur, it's that much more devastating--and gives sufficient motivation for Chan/Billy to do what they do in the finale. It also prevents the believability hole that Billy wouldn't seek Dignam after those events.* And this is another place where Infernal Affairs shines--the focus on the two moles. The movie really explores how pretending to be someone else can affect the way someone thinks and behaves. Chan is just as desperate as Billy to get out, but Chan also keeps a better eye for justice, despite his problems. Likewise, Lau's character (Damon's Colin) has to grapple with the life afforded him by being a goody-two shoes and figure out just where his loyalties lie and why. This leads Infernal Affairs' ending to be more effective than the Departed's, because it's not cheap and the impact of Lau's decision weighs with him even after the credits roll. No one laughs at the end of Infernal Affairs.* The Departed doesn't have Infernal Affairs' flash and bang, but that works to its advantage--it's restraint, at least stylistically really helps what drama it has. Having come from a long tradition of Hong Kong films, the style pushes melodrama at times in IA.All complaints aside, The Departed really is still quite an enjoyable film. The craftsmanship of all involved is highly polished and immensely engaging. Even though they share the same base, Infernal Affairs and the Departed are both different films, although they could've learned something from each other. The Departed is really good, but it lacks the resonance needed to bring it to the level of Scorsese's more notable works. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Good, but not as good as the original","Just got back from seeing this in Taiwan (where it opened yesterday, in time for Mid-Autumn festival) Good movie, but decided to re-watch the original (Infernal Affairs) back home... and the original edges over it in terms of emotion, pace and character development.'The departed' is great once it gets going and the premise really starts to kick in,and jack Nicholson is incredible, but I can't help feeling that the director was going for too much humour - from the 9at times0 overly witty dialogue to the closing scene. And some of the set pieces - the elevator scene near the end, for example, are not handled as well as in the original (the audience laughed out loud during the elevator scene, and I'm not sure that was the intended effect).All in all, a good film, but I feel it just misses out on being a great one, especially when compared with its Asian counterpart.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Good & Bad Of 'The Departed',"THE GOOD - A big collection of well-known male actors headed by veteran Jack Nicholson give standout performances. Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon play guys who are both working both sides of the fence and the big suspense revolves around their characters and if will be found out. Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg, ---- (the only female with many lines), Alec Baldwin, and Ray Winstone give superb support. My favorite was Winstone, a guy I'm familiar with from ""Sexy Beast"" and ""The Proposition."" Despite the length of this movie, it keeps your interest all the way. I never got more bored... BUT....THE BAD - ....I did get tired of all the f-words. Usually I could care less about that, but over 250 of them? Sometimes it seemed like every sentence. It was ludicrous and after awhile, your senses seemed bombarded with it, such as too much action can numb you. It just wasn't necessary to have it said THAT many times, and by practically everybody in the film. That's my other main complaint: every character in here is a scumbag: an untrustworthy person who will sleep with anyone and lie to everyone. Baldwin's character, as an FBI director, was the most ridiculous of them all. Both of these faults are typical for a Martin Scorcese film. He's pathetic. Sorry, Marty, but not every person in the world is a low-life as you must be.OVERALL - Nonethelss, to be fair, his movies - like this one - are usually interesting, just the sordid stuff done to excess.

One of Martin Scorsese's finest movies. Period.,"It's hard to start a review about a movie when you're still so excited you don't know where to begin. Let's take a deep breath for a moment... okay, and here we go:Although he was snubbed by the Academy over and over again Scorsese never stopped working on ambitious projects. He just kept making movies, and they were all solid and good. Still, somehow Scorsese's work lost the importance and the excitement of the director's best movies. ""The Departed"" brings back a Scorsese that glues your eyes to the screen, that makes you forget time and space around you. This is a film that keeps you thrilled for the entire two and a half hours running time.Truth be told, Scorsese doesn't reinvent himself with this movie. The violence, the callous dialog and the soundtrack including ""Gimme Shelter"" and other classic songs from the 60's and 70's - none of that is new territory. Still, it's a hell of a treat to watch the master at work. There's no one who makes a gangster movie like Scorsese. He understands exactly what the story needs, how it needs to be paced. Scorsese's direction serves the plot and not the other way round, which is what sets ""The Departed"" apart from some of his other masterpieces such as ""Raging Bull"".Quite a lot of movieshave five, six or seven top stars in their casting list. In the end you're often let down because some of them don't really have important roles or only very limited screen time. In this movie all of the big names make something of their role: Mark Wahlberg as the amazingly unfriendly but unbribable cop, Martin Sheen as Nicholson's opponent and DiCaprio's father figure, Alec Baldwin as the frustratingly idiotic boss and Matt Damon as the slippery traitor. The two actors that make ""The Departed"" what it is, however, are, of course, Jack Nicholson and Leonardo DiCaprio.Jack Nicholson is just Jack Nicholson. He does what he always does, which means that he's great. He was born to play the bad guy. It's quite amazing that he hadn't worked with Scorsese before and it's like a fanboy's dream come true to see their collaboration working out so well. One can't help thinking: ""What if DeNiro had played the part?"". Sure, that might have been interesting, too, but it's doubtable whether DeNiro would have been able to pull off a villain as clownish and sexed up as Frank Costello.Speaking of DeNiro, Leonardo DiCaprio clearly has proved himself a more than worthy successor as Scorsese's steady collaboration partner. His performance as the tormented undercover cop is once again outstanding. His hounded look alone creates half of the movies' tension. It's quite amazing how versatile this little babyface is. ""The Departed"" should convince even the last skeptics of this guy's talents.At the age of 64 and after movie classics as legendary and influential as ""Taxi Driver"", ""Raging Bull"" and ""GoodFellas"", Martin Scorsese has delivered one of the very best movies of his entire career. Its characters may not be as iconic as the ones from the movies mentioned above, but the superb storytelling and the amazing acting in ""The Departed"" make this nothing less than a true masterpiece.

Scorsese probably had great fun directing this,"Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) is a gangster of Irish heritage running crime in South Boston. The police are always trying to build a case against him but nothing sticks, so they enlist somebody who is training to be a cop, BIlly Costigan, to go undercover to get the goods on Costello. From a criminal transaction that is supposed to go down that does not, Billy does surmise that there is a rat in the State Police. And he'd be right, while the bad cop, Colin (Matt Damon) realizes that there is a rat in Costello's organization. But the records of who is undercover are off limits for everybody but the two police officers who recruited Costigan, so Colin is going to have to find out through old fashioned probing who the rat is. And so it goes for the rest of the film, with the undercover cop and the bad cop both trying to find out who the other is first, because finding out second would be too late. Complications as well as a police psychiatrist being lovers to both Colin and Billy - and not realizing who either of them truly is - ensues.There is something of a prologue with Irish mobster Frank Costello narrating about his environment, the Knights of Columbus, JFK and black people with the kind of language about the latter of which Disney would disapprove, but it's necessary to paint a picture of what kind of guy Costello is upfront.To me it's the fast food of Scorsese's catalog, but then everybody enjoys fast food from time to time. It does a great job of building tension and suspense, and there are good pay-offs for sticking to the end. Plus it is just plain fun to have a bunch of great actors running around shouting ""microprocessors"" in thick Boston accents.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

One thing I think makes a great director is the use of inanimate objects as characters. If you haven't seen this film, watch the Boston State Capitol building appearances. It says more with no duologue than some entire scripts do. Some songs are used with more visual themes than others, but the audio counterpart to the eye-popping candy is so intense I just couldn't wait for the next scene to unfold.

Scorsese is in his prime with The Departed,"If there was any doubt about Martin Scorsese's craft as a film director, The Departed silences any critic of his. However, if there was any doubt in the first place I highly suggest quitting movies. Scorsese delivers an epic in a time where movies are being churned out with no emotion, no connection to the viewer, and reliance on gimmicks so the studios can earn a little dough and taking the prized honor of being the number 1 listed movie on a 12 year old kid's myspace page.The Departed delivers in every facet. The cinematography is well crafted - the camera positions to grasp the scene in its fullest while avoiding being generic and also straying away from overly ""artsy"" camera angles that make the film unwatchable. In fact, The Departed is probably Scorsese's most rewatchable film. There are more twists than a Chubby Checker concert which will make you both gasp and let out sighs of relief.The characters are believable and engaging. Jack Nicholson plays one the most accessible of all the mob villains of Scorsese's past. He is complete slime, but his demeanor is that of an uncle who permits you to watch the TV shows that your parents told you not to. Matt Damon as Colin is like one of those pompous pricks who cheat repeatedly and get away with it, and Leo as Billy Costigan grows on the viewer and as a character through his dangerous line of work as a police informant.The Departed is an American masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Ridiculously overrated.,"Maybe it deserves a 7. It is quite to very suspenseful, with a valuably complex but not arcane plot, well-made, solidly acted (meaning in part that Jack Nicholson does not just re-enact his job as the Joker. DiCaprio was better in Blood Diamond.) The cast is indeed stunning.But right now it is ranked above such trivial fare as Citizen Kane, The Shining, North by Northwest, M, Vertigo, To Kill a Mockingbird, Eternal Sunshine, Bicycle Thieves...(citing only a few whose lower ranks make me want to vomit). I know I am beating a dead horse. It probably is, after all, better than Shawshank (dumb fanboy movie of the world, I guess), Cuckoo's Nest, Inception, Forrest Gump, and arguably 5 to 15 others in the top 46.But it has limited to no imagination and makes no contribution to film history. Its best picture Oscar should've gone to Pan's Labyrinth, or Volver, or conceivably The Lives of Others, or Letters from Iwo Jima, or Little Miss Sunshine--three to five other films to rank ahead of Departed. I haven't yet seen Infernal Affairs, so I can't make that comparison. But in a nutshell, I know Taxi Driver and Departed is no Taxi Driver (#68. Makes me nuts.)",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Let's start with the bad points:,"I think that one or two of the performances from the lead actors were overrated.Matt Damon, for me, seems to fluctuate between good and bad performances. He was great in The Talented Mr Ripley and The Bourne Identity/Supremacy. But I thought this was one of his worse films. His acting seemed quite wooden and forced, and I don't think he was comfortable in his role of a boyfriend.I also think that, early on, Jack Nicholson showed his age, although he did improve greatly as the film went on.On a positive note, Leonardo Di Caprio was outstanding. He's one of the most underrated and best actors around at the moment (he's come a long way since his teenage heart-throb status) and could quite easily have added this to his best actor nomination in the Oscars this year. This film would have struggled if it were not for Di Caprio.As far as the film in itself goes, I hadn't seen or heard much about the original Hong Kong version and was glad of it, as I could judge this solely on its own merit.It's thrilling, with so much suspense. Who's going to make a breakthrough first? Costello's men or the Police? I hadn't seen this before the Oscars, and at first I couldn't quite work out how on earth best Motion Picture didn't go to Little Miss Sunshine.

A Knockout,"""The Departed"" is arguably the greatest cop movie ever made, and certainly one of the best movies of the 2000s - period. What Scorsese did with this movie was masterful: he took a perfectly good crime thriller (the original ""Infernal Affairs"") and elevated it even higher to become a saga of class, race, betrayal, and ""families always rising and falling in America."" ""The Departed"" is one of the most hard-edged, dramatic, and gripping movies that I've ever seen, with a multi-layered story that keeps you coming back to the film again and again. I love the central premise, which takes classic Scorsese tropes like Catholic guilt and ethnic identity and fuses them with true crime history - Frank Costello, after all, is based on Boston's infamous Whitey Bulger.On a technical level this movie is outstanding: the direction, musical score, and cinematography are amazing - but nothing is more impressive to me than the editing. Thelma Schoonmaker well deserved the Oscar for Best Film Editing on ""The Departed,"" which might not have been half as good if not for Schoomaker's past pacing and experimental style. As always in a Scorsese picture the performances are phenomenal: everyone from Leo DiCaprio to Martin Sheen is on their A-game in this one. Though by far my favorite performance is Jack Nicholson as Costello - he brings together humor, sleaze, and menace simultaneously and it makes for a truly terrifying villain.The decision to set the film in Boston, where the movie's rich themes are deeply ingrained in the city's history, was brilliant. The casting of real-life Bostonians such as Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg, and the choice of Dorchester's William Monahan as screenwriter, gives ""The Departed"" an authenticity that many other Boston-set movies lack. After watching this movie again I'll say that I do have a slight problem with the running time - you do sometimes feel the movie's two and a half hour length, and there's a handful of scenes that could either be cut down or removed entirely. But it by no means ruins the viewing experience, in fact despite its length ""The Departed"" remains endlessly entertaining.The fact that Scorsese took good material and made it even better is the reason why ""The Departed"" is perhaps the best remake ever made and certainly one of my favorite crime dramas. 10/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Scorsese nails the cat-and-mouse dramatic thriller,"Scorcese does like himself an intricate plot, and The Departed arguably has one of the better storylines in film today, pitting two acting heavyweights against one another for 2.5 hours. Strong acting throughout this cast (DiCaprio, Damon, Nicholson, Sheen etc.) helps push this story along, interspersed with some decent action and more than a few twists.There were points where I felt the story was lagging somewhat, and the romantic interest seemed overly forced to me.

A great plot that spirals out of control,"The Departed is very instructive in showing us how to write a crime thriller, and how not to. It starts with a terrific premise: cops and criminals have a mole in the each other's organization. But this is also a premise that is loaded with pitfalls. In the Great Screen writing Class, I talk extensively about how you develop your premise, to learn not only the potential strengths of your idea but also the hidden structural weaknesses.In The Departed, the writers must immediately confront the difficulty of two main characters. Again, the need to cross-cut between two leads first takes a toll on the definition of the characters. The writers are so interested in getting the plot going they fail to give Billy (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) a motive for going undercover. As the story progresses, it becomes clear that no one in this movie has a motive for what they do.Lack of character motive (which is connected to the first major structure step, the Need) is always a big weakness. But in a story already dominated by plot, this is a disaster. The characters are nuts and bolts being moved by plot mechanics.The premise does highlight the strength of The Departed, which is the plot. But it also shows us how even the best plot can spiral out of control.Plot in crime stories is all about opposition under the surface, and The Departed is worth studying to see how to create that, not only in a crime story but in any work of fiction. But when you are creating your plot, you have to be aware of the fundamental trade-off between plot and believability. The more you try to hide the opposition under the surface - thus giving you more plot - the more you push the believability of your characters to the extreme. You become so conscious of creating surprise that you force the characters to take actions that they, and indeed no human being, would logically do.This believability problem surfaces right away when Billy, who has been to the police academy, becomes the mole in the Costello crime family. It would be so obvious that this guy is the snitch that I was immediately reminded of Clark Kent and Superman. Somehow when Superman puts on a suit and a pair of nerdy glasses no one can see that he is Superman. In a fantasy superhero story, the audience accepts that convention and lets it pass. Not so in a realistic crime story.The writers keep the believability problems at bay for most of the story. But any story that emphasizes plot always pushes the reveals to the end, where whatever believability problems it has will be magnified as the reveals come fast and furious. Sure enough, The Departed rapidly disintegrates into farce and stupidity. The final sequence is filled with reveals and assassinations, but they are based on actions so mindlessly dumb that the audience is left muttering, ""No! No! No!"" Even worse, this sort of false plot, sprung at the end, kills the audience's sense of investment in the film itself. If it's so easy to assassinate these characters, why didn't they just shoot Costello in the first place and save me 2 1/2 hours of my time.FOR MORE REVIEWS, please go to www.truby.com",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
scorsese's winner,"The Departed offers you one of the best stories of mafia. Certainly the best combination of mob and police in the same movie. There are many good mafia films but this one sticks out because of its great usage of police. The value of this movie does not shrink to the fact that the film is mostly a remake to the Hongkong movie. The value is based how this one has been done. I gotta tell you, it's pretty damn high. And the reason behind that is Martin Scorsese. He absolutely nails this film. He, like Francis Ford Coppola, has a special eye for a mob films. And quite simply, this is his finest product.Leonardo DiCaprio (Billy) is one the best actors around. He is always so good. Never seen him underperformed. He gives a great shot here too. Jack Nicholson (Frank) is always reliable. Matt Damon (Colin) was good. But Mark Wahlberg (Dignam) was most impressive. Quite a performance from him. Very confident. In overall, it's just a first-class cast.The Departed is perfect film for a movie night. It's intense, has plenty of action, great story and great performances. Plus there are two huge bonuses. First one - the movie comes about Boston which is a great city. Second one - the movie has an awesome soundtrack which many films do not have. It has everything a winner should have.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Departed is outstanding,"From the start The Departed had me with all its intriguing characters and storyline. The story flowed and moved along nicely, the opening of the movie was brilliant and does what a film should do, it grabs your attention and makes you ask a lot of questions and it only gets better from there with the ending being a absolute masterpiece. This film is perfect. The characters are all interesting and their personalities are shown through the great acting from the cast. Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg do some of their best in The Departed with their witty and down to the point characters and Leonardo DiCaprio is outstanding as always and all the acting is very good throughout. The thing I really like about this film is how it flicks between the two characters Billy (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Colin (Matt Damon) and the contrast it shows of the two but also the similarities.From start to finish The Departed is excellent with its twists, drama and humour. The Departed is one of the best films I have ever watched and if you haven't watched it yet your missing out.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Don't f**k with Nicholson,"This is Scorsese's masterpiece. I love most of Martin's work but this is his gem. He won best director for this movie and this also won best picture. All well deserved. In my top ten list this is #3. A lot of people don't like this movie because they say the plot is too confusing. Frankly, I thought the same thing after first viewing it. After several watched, I know what was going on and who was who. The dialogue is sharply written and the performances are outlandishly entertaining. Everything about this movie is great and frankly, I don't find any flaws in it. People might think I'm being too generous and that I'm blinded by my love for Scorsese. No, I just know a damn good movie when I see one. This is a gangster drama that hits all the right notes and has a great soundtrack to go along with it. I also love how much they swear in the movie. It's hilarious and its used well too. A lot of times, swearing is abused and overused in movies. Now, I have heard people cuss this movie out for how much swearing there is but realize that people talk like this. Maybe not all the time, but they do. The cast is beyond superb and all of them do a great job. I love this movie, and hopefully someone who reads this, then watches it will uh, love it too. All thumbs up!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Great Acting,"The acting was great and the production aswell. The thing that i most disliked about the movie is how dumb and naive Costello was.

Haunting...,"A remake of the 2002 Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs, Scorsese's 'The Departed' is a haunting film, so effective, that I still have a hang-over of it. Scorsese actually shatters himself by getting into a world of blood, back-stabbing and cruel intelligence. For those who haven't seen this box office smash yet, take time out from other non-sense, and watch this!This Masterstroke takes place in Boston, Massachusetts, where Irish Mob boss Francis ""Frank"" Costello played by Nicholson plants Colin Sullivan played by Damon as an informant within the Massachusetts State Police. Simultaneously, the police assign undercover cop Billy Costigan played by DiCaprio to infiltrate Costello's crew. When both sides realize the situation, each man attempts to discover the others true identity before being found out. The original Hong Kong flick was a masterstroke! And this is a true and best remake possible! Scorsese has made so many remarkable films, that I've lost count by now. He's at his fiery best and his executes the subject with tremendous ease. A True Legend! His biggest accomplishment was, that, He was finally respected by the Academy-Awards for his work here! Halleujah! Michael Ballhaus's Cinematography is eye-catching. William Monahan's adapted screenplay is marvelous.In the acting department, Mark Wahlberg steals the show with a brilliant performance. The rawness and overdose of abusive language help the talented actor steal the show in this multi-starrer. Jack Nicholson, as always, is flawless. Leonardo DiCaprio is superb, he lives his character from start to end. Matt Damon is amazing, as ever. Martin Sheen proves yet again he's a talent that we'll never forget. He's exceptional. Alec Baldwin is in command after a long time. The veteran scores! Vera Farmiga is perfect. Ray Winstone does full justice to his part. Anthony Anderson leaves a mark as well.'The Departed' is a winner all the way! The film keeps you at grip from start to end, and will leave you thinking about it for a long, long time. It's amongst the finest films ever made! Two Big Thumbs Up!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
This movie is simply not one of Scorsese's great ones.,"I went to The Departed last night on the strength of some of the reviews I'd read. And while it was a fairly good movie, it is not great. In my opinion, Scorsese has taken an interesting story and a very good cast and created a somewhat-better-than-mediocre picture. The photography is very good, the shots well done for the most part, but he has made some odd choices. The most puzzling is the Chinese/microchip issue. This could have and, in my opinion, should have been omitted. It doesn't move the plot, it doesn't add depth or breadth to the story and it doesn't help to develop any of the characters.Some of the acting was uneven as well. I love some of Matt Damon's work, but I never felt an emotional connection with this character. I had the sense that I was watching him act. Even his accent isn't consistent, changing from the Boston Southie he displayed in Good Will Hunting to Midwestern.Jack Nicholson is Jack Nicholson, and that's the problem with his portrayal. Unconvincing.There are other issues I have with this movie, but on the positive side, Mark Wahlberg and Alce Baldwin are both quite enjoyable to watch. And by far the best performance, without question, is given by Leonardo DiCaprio. This young man can act! He has a way of becoming the character and his performance here is worth the price of admission.So, my suggestion is to go and see this movie, but don't set your expectations at the level suggested by some of the almost hysterically glowing reviews. If you do, you will be disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Scorsese's Departed is a winner of 4/5 Oscars,"This is a great rendition of the original Chinese movie ""Infernal Affairs."" Martin Scorsese won his first Best Director Academy Award for ""The Departed"" and plants the story in Boston with the Irish Mob and the Massachusetts Police Force.
Jack Nicholson is as great as ever playing the Irish boss that is infiltrating the Police Department. Leonardo DiCaprio shines as an undercover cop so underground that only Martin Sheen's character Queenan and Mark Wahlberg's Sergeant Dignam know about his secret operations. Vera Farmiga plays his police psychologist, Madolyn. DiCaprio and Farmiga's chemistry is undeniably electric and roots the movie with hope. Their love affair reaches a zenith while the song ""Comfortably Numb"" by Pink Floyd plays underneath the scene, while the rain falls outside and the characters explore their vulnerability.

The Departed vs Infernal Affairs,"The Departed is one of the best cop moves in years. I hadn't heard of Infernal Affairs before watching The Departed, and had only a vague inkling that The Departed was based on some Hong Kong film. For the first 90% of its length The Departed promises to be a classic, an all time great. It's a film of restrained violence that serves the plot. A cop (DiCaprio) is planted as a mole in a crime gang headed by Jack Nichoson. His task to report on the gang's activities with the eventual object of nabbing the whole bunch including Nicholson.The ingenious touch is that Nicholson too has a mole (Damon) in the police. Damon's task is to report to Nicholson on the police investigations on his gang, so that Nicholson knows when to go ahead with a deal, when to keep low or in some cases Damon would clear the way of police so that Nicholson can go ahead with his plans.Both these moles have been operating in their respective roles for years. So much so that Damon is actually becoming quite a good cop with a moral dilemma, while DiCaprio is becoming quite a bad ass with an equally desperate dilemma - he knows if he plays gangster too long he might actually be one for the rest of his life.DiCaprio is desperate to get out of his predicament and begs the only two cops who know of his identity as a mole (Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg) to let him back into the police. Before his career as a mole began his records with the police were all deleted. Without Sheen and Wahlberg no one could identify Dicaprio as a cop.This already tense situation is compounded no end when each side discovers at around the same time that each has a mole in the other's ranks. To ensure their own survival Damon and Dicaprio work feverishly to find out each other's identity, and the tension grips you.We are taken through several set piece sequences to what seems likely to be an unbearably tense finale but at this point the move lets us down. There is one too many killings at the end, and I was left wondering whether the serious film-making I had witnessed approaching the end was meant to be taken seriously as the end sequences are almost comic.Nevertheless the ingenious plot device, the powerhouse performances by the leading cast led by DiCaprio make this a very good, highly watchable film. But I was a little disappointed by the ending.Not long after I found out that this was based on the Hong Kong movie Infernal Affairs (made in 2002) and proceeded to get my hands on it. My main motive was to find out if the ending was handled any better.Since this is a review of The Departed I'll keep my comments on Infernal Affairs very brief. Suffice to say that the latter is much the better film. It's 50 mins shorter, but in no way loses out in terms of character development. As far as I can see The Departed was 50 mins longer only for the sake of character development. The ending of Infernal Affais is more restrained, and far more effective. Indeed Infernal Affairs is one of the great cop movies in history in any language. The Departed cannot be considered as anything other than a remake. All the key set pieces are copied wholesale from Infernal Affairs as of course is the plot.Martin Scorcese is long overdue for an Oscar, and as everyone knows is nominated this year for The Departed. For a Director who has made such original classics as Taxi Driver and Raging Bull to win for this would be almost an insult. No doubt he feels differently.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Dark and brutal.Scorsese's most accomplished and entertaining film to date.,"One could look at The Departed and can get the idea that this is less a remake than it is a re-imagining of the riveting crime Drama INTERNAL AFFAIRS.It's more of an inspiration than it is a direct lift off.The story may be the same,but there's a vast difference between Scorsese's epic and the Hong Kong Classic.And for that,this film is truly a fascinating look at the ugly worlds of the two sides of the law.Rookie Cop Billy Costigan goes undercover and is assigned to work for Crime Boss Frank Costello and get really close to him to deliver some information about his crimes.Costigan gains Costello's trust and gets involved a lot deeper in his crimes.On the other hand ,a rising police office is actually a mole in the department, informs everything about the Police Department's movements to Costello.But things get deadly when both men are about to have their secrets exposed and the Mobs and the cops discover that there is a mole/informer,and a traitor who's getting things messed up on both sides.And then they both try to save themselves from each other and the Mobs.They slowly get confused with their dual identities and things get deadlier for the both of them as their delicate balance with the Mobs and the Cops gets them too involved with the world they're into.While both men are in love with the same women,one of them has to suffer the consequences.Leading to a shocking conclusion to this epic.There are intense scenes of violence and action and twists that you never see coming.A Martin Scorsese film is always dark,graphically violent,raw,hard edged,and filled with memorable powerhouse performances.And this film is no exception.The Departed is something new and different .Its complex plot unfolds to an even more powerful story ,with characters colliding with one another and facing terrifying situations.Scorsese shows that what it is like to be a cop.Your life is in danger 24/7 ,and that every minute is a risk when you're undercover.Your only fear is having your true identity be exposed.And then,it's all up to the person who's holding a gun to your face.It's a tough film he carved out,and to be honest it's a perfect example of how a remake should be made.It's actually as good as the original,even better at times.And shows that when it is helled by a legendary director who knows what he is doing the results are always great for a remake.To compare the original and this one,I would say this one is slightly better than the original.Otherwise,it's just as brilliant as the Hong Kong version.But the thing about this film is that even if you've seen the Hong Kong version,you'll still be blown away by the Hollywood version.However,comparisons are inevitable.What else can you ask for when you have a cast this big?I could only recall one such film that had such a huge cast at the moment,and that was Ocean's 11.Where that film didn't do full justice with its cast,this film makes use of its actors and gives you a rare piece of entertainment that is thought-provoking and ingenious.Scorsese really have given a great piece of work.I wouldn't say this is his best work ever,his best directed film was GANGS OF NEW YORK ,which he should've won an Osacar for,but it certainly is one his best work since Goodfellas in the crime genre.It's got the usual trademarks of the director.The script is fantastic.The writer has done a terrific job in this remake.It makes the film a standout from the original.Rich CinematographyThe cinematography is rich,and the editing is sharp. The Score is superb,Scorsese's choice of music is great.And the look of the film and its sets are brilliant,getting us old and new Boston.And lots of cell phone use.Well,you're wondering who's the show stealer out of a giant cast like this.Everyone got to do something with full satisfaction.But the real standout here is Di Caprio and Damon.The actors have only gotten better and better recently and here they pull it off again.They are complex and tough characters to play and they play their part brilliantly.Di Caprio's emotional stature is strong.He manages to bring the character's fear and confusion with full conviction.You do feel sad in the end for what happens to him.You will be shocked and it was unfair for the character.Damon on the other hand is superb as the mole who informs the crime bosses.Their face off and rivalries are intense and suspenseful.And of course,Jack Nicholson couldn't have had more fun doing a film like this than doing another sad comedy.His and Scorsese's collaboration is another reason,altogether a different reason, to watch this film.At this age,he could still pull off juicy performances,and do all that he's done on screen really makes you wonder if he's ever gonna do another film with Scorsese again.And his over the top performance is really fun to watch.Wahlberg is great in his role as the tough cop who talks tough to his co-officers.Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen are both terrific.Vera Farimiga was a real surprise as a women who falls in love with both leading men.She plays her part really well and you kind of feel sad that why didn't she chose the character that deserved her.Of course, this film is not without its flaws,and I expected it to end with a bang,whereas the writer seemed to have abandoned the script's energy and just concluded it somewhat like the original film.It was an uneven conclusion.And I just wasn't sure why was it necessary to do what the writer did to the main characters in the end.But regardless of that the rest of the film is a tour de force raw drama.A modern classic and a definite must-see of the year.This film can count on its chances of being at the Oscars next year.A sure fire success.The Departed is the most exciting,fun and thrilling dark crime Drama of the year.And it's fully satisfying and very entertaining.Highly Recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Breathless But Bewildering,"This has enough violence and gritty street stuff to be another intriguing descent into the world of crime and punishment for Scorsese and his blend of attractive brutality, but it is vastly overrated. It can be confusing and less than engaging as its myriad of mobsters and cops parade in and out of frame with varying results of believability.The acting and characterizations are all over the place with wide ranges of volume and machismo. One example is that the affairs of the heart here are never founded and come across as less than real. Take the scene in the restaurant. Is that for one minute real with its forced laughter? Or the bedroom/sex scene.It is a movie that seems full of itself rather than full. The complexities are so twisted and run by so fast that its hard to keep up with it all. It could be that the pacing is such to give it that dizzying feeling of being trapped like a rat in the bowels of the beast, but its breathless energy sucks the life out of the story and its just whiz-bang, bang, bang, bang.While not without its attractions of audacious anarchy, and it delivers so much that it is hard not to get involved in the goings-on. But the Director has made many better films and one cannot get the feeling that the adulation for this one is misplaced or in place of past disregards.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

An actor's extravaganza,"With this remake of the Hong Kong actioner ""Internal Affairs"", Scorsese makes his mark again with a gripping crime saga in the vein of GOODFELLAS (1990) and CASINO (1995). This time he ventures into what must be somewhat less familiar territory for the director, the Irish milieu in South Boston, but screenwriter William Monahan is a Boston native and seems to know his targets inside out.The cast is to die for, with a line-up of almost exclusively A-list actors. First there is Jack Nicholson as Jeff Costello (a reference to Alain Delon's character in Jean-Pierre Melville's 1967 classic LE SAMOURAI), a psychotic Irish crime boss. Jack Nicholson simply doesn't give bad performances, but here his performance borders on caricature, but somehow he manages to check it in such away, it remains acceptable. Perhaps Scorsese should have toned him down a little, but who can control Jack Nicholson? Who wants to? Perhaps over the top, but hugely entertaining. Perhaps he is the only actor who can get away with this. The rest of the cast is simply outstanding with Leonardo DiCaprio in a very impressive role as Billy Costigan, an undercover cop infiltrating Jeff Costello's gang. Matt Damon as sergeant Sullivan is somewhat more one-note but it seems to fit his role just right. Perhaps he intended it this way. Mark Wahlberg is very amusing as the most twisted, hostile and foul-mouthed cop in recent screen history.On a credibility level, the film put me to the test a couple of times. Why is Jeff Costello, who runs multi-million dollar drug transports, still collecting protection money in person from Pakistani shop owners? The sub-plot with the delivery of microprocessors to the Chinese for the fabrication of advanced weaponry was truly laughable, especially the encounter between Nicholson and his cronies and a Chinese gang in leather jackets. It looked like a scene from a grade-Z '80s action flick. At times the setting in the film plays more like the '70s, despite the very 2006 cell phones, that play such a crucial role in the film, they almost grow into a character of their own. This must be the film with the most close-ups of cell-phones so far.In South Boston all little Irish boys seem to grow up as cops or criminals. I am not sure whether this film should be seen as a realistic depiction of the Boston crime world. In the core, it probably is, but it's more a like a mixture of '70s values, clothes and family ties, with some modern elements thrown in the mix. Irish blokes standing in front of a restaurant with their caps and all, I don't know. Somehow, it seems more like a throwback to another age. Or perhaps in some places, like South Boston, things never change. But probably that's the whole point. Scorsese always presents us an over-inflated dreamworld, where in the end every person runs wildly amok. With Scorsese, bad guys are not just bad guys. They are out-of-control monsters, whether it is Jeff Costello in this film or Joe Pesci in GOODFELLAS or CASINO, they all have an almost comic book flair, which doesn't make 'em any less interesting. On the contrary, after all, this IS the movies. The truth is no excuse. Often, the imagination is far more interesting.I still have to chew a little on this, but this film is quite an overwhelming experience. One of those films, that was already a classic before it came out. Besides some of the aforementioned reservations, these still were a dynamite 149 minutes.Camera Obscura --- 8/10",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Average Scorsese - which means it's still a fine film, just not one of his best","Scorsese's long-awaited remake of the 2002 Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs. Infernal Affairs was a good film, but it always seemed to me like a gimmick, and more like a skeleton of a film than a real film. Scorsese predictably fleshes it out so it doesn't seem as much like just a good concept. The actors add a lot to it, too (though the Hong Kong actors, including Andy Lau and Tony Leung, were very good, as well). I don't think it stands anywhere near Scorsese's best work myself. It doesn't carry near the weight of Goodfellas, for instance. It starts to get a little silly near the end, and the director makes a few really bad choices  especially including that awful image in the final shot. That's just plain embarrassing film-making. And that's not to mention the awful choice the filmmakers made to change a certain part of the ending of Infernal Affairs - the original is definitely stronger in that respect. Of the actors, my favorite was Mark Wahlberg. Matt Damon comes in second, and DiCaprio third. Nicholson has a lot of fun as the gangster. The best comparison with previous Jack performances is actually the Joker from Burton's first Batman movie. Alec Baldwin has probably the most memorable moment, where he expresses his love for the Patriot Act. Well worth seeing, but definitely not best-of-the-year material. I would rank it quite below Scorsese's previous two films from this decade, The Aviator and Gangs of New York.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Jack is not only an evil psychopath, but has a prankster, little boy quality as well. Leo shows every emotion there is, Alex Baldwin is hilarious as is Mark Wahlberg.

The Renaissance,"Martin Scorsese has reached a point in his career where he has free reign to do whatever he wishes as a director. It's hallowed ground for an auteur, and as such, every actor worth his salt would kill to work for him knowing full well that whatever Scorsese chooses to do will be an uncompromising work of art. With ""The Departed"" he has quite possibly one of the greatest casts ever assembled. The deliciously convoluted plot based on the recent Asian flick ""Infernal Affairs"" showcases Jack Nicholson as an Irish mob boss; Leonardo DiCaprio as an undercover cop infiltrating the crime ring; Matt Damon as the crime ring's inside man with the police unit assigned to bring them down; Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, and Mark Wahlberg as the cops working above Damon and DiCaprio; and a breakthrough role for Vera Farmiga as a police psychiatrist in a love triangle with Damon and DiCaprio. This brief but confusing rundown is merely the tip of the iceberg and reveals nothing of the plot twists and tension riddling every aspect of the film like bullet holes from a machine gun massacre.By now, Scorsese is to crime dramas what Hitchcock was to psychological thrillers. Comparatively, he's at the same point in his long career Hitchcock was when he gave us ""Rear Window,"" ""Psycho,"" and ""Vertigo."" Scorsese could've directed this blindfolded and it would've still been first rate. What's so thrilling about Scorsese as a filmmaker is that he's always directing full throttle with his eyes wide open. ""The Departed"" is so ridiculously good it left me with chills afterward. After a brief departure to big budget Oscar pushes with ""Gangs of New York"" and ""The Aviator,"" Scorsese returns to the familiar ground of his most revered projects like ""Taxi Driver,"" ""Raging Bull,"" Goodfellas,"" and ""Casino."" All his hallmarks are here: fantastic use of music, brilliantly choreographed bouts of violence, heart-pounding editing, deep and meaningful camera shots and movement, religious iconography, an epic and detailed sense of place (in this case, Boston), and highly quotable dialogue that is dramatic and funny and full of pathos in all the right places.With its rising tension and cat-and-mouse theatrics, ""The Departed"" is easily the most viscerally thrilling studio film to come down the pike in many moons. Scorsese doesn't just treat us to his usual bag of tricks, he re-imagines them, and in exorcising perfectly balanced performances from an amazingly talented cast that in the hands of lesser director may have gone over-the-top, he delivers a modern day tragedy on par with greatest works of Shakespeare. For Scorsese, the big screen is his canvas, the camera his paint brush, and the blood splattered across the screen his awe-inspiring brush strokes. He's a veteran, he's a master, and ""The Departed"" is his Renaissance.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Not even close to one of Scorsese's best,"I hate to use the word overrated, but that is a pretty good word for this movie. This is Scorsese on autopilot working with potboiler material, but for some reason filmgoers and the film establishment decided to heap this movie with tons of accolades that Scorsese's other, lesser known work is much more worthy of. It feels like a slightly elevated version of dozens of other crime and cop action movies. There are great actors and great performances in this movie, but the plot did not keep me engaged enough to follow its many twists and turns. The ending is so over the top and ridiculous that it borders on parody.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Quick Review,"I was never one of those people who thought that Martin Scorsese had lost his touch. I just thought that as he had grown older his interests had changed, and that was completely fine. No because I believe this would not say that The Departed is Scorsese's comeback. The Departed is his best film since Goodfellas, and is a complete masterpiece. The performances are top notch. If Dicaprio isn't at least nominated I will be extremely mad. Wahlberg and Nicholson are also both stand outs, and I hope both get nominations. Damon and Farmiga are both also amazing. The rest of the cast are very good, but don't stand out in the amazing cast. The script is also great. The dialogue is brilliant and they manage to give each and every character enough development to work well. I also hope Shore is nominated for his brilliant score. Those Irish strings and bagpipes pipe at exactly the right time. The Departed is Scorsese's best in years, and truthfully one of his best ever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
a good film but less compelling than Goodfellas,"In Martin Scorcese's ""The Departed,"" Leonardo Di Caprio and Matt Damon play dueling ""moles"" working at cross purposes on opposite sides of the law. Di Caprio is Billy Costigan, a rookie recruited by the Massachusetts State Police to go undercover to infiltrate the gang headed by Irish mafia boss, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Damon is Colin Sullivan, a seemingly straight-laced detective who, in reality, is a ""rat"" planted by Costello in the heart of the investigative unit, whose job it is to tip the mob boss off when the cops are getting just a little too close to his unsavory operations.The film, a remake of the Hong Kong flick ""Infernal Affairs,"" finds Scorcese back in the familiar territory of tough-talking ethnic gangsters (although for once the Italians are let off the hook) and urban violence. In terms of box office receipts and year's-end awards ceremonies, the return trip has certainly paid off handsomely for the director. Yet, for all the accolades it has garnered, ""The Departed"" falls short of the ""Goodfellas"" glory of a decade and a half ago for reasons that are not always easy to pinpoint or fathom.On the positive side, Scorcese, never one to stint on his performers, has gathered a powerhouse cast for the occasion. In addition to Di Caprio and Damon, who provide some of the most solid and subtle work of their careers thus far, the movie boasts Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg in stellar supporting roles. Nicholson does yet another variation of the sardonic, scenery-chewing bad guy he's done countless times before, but since nobody does that shtick better than he, we don't mind watching it yet another time.The greatest strength of the film lies in the complexity of the storyline, as the parallel cat-and-mouse scenarios continually twist and turn and ultimately dovetail into each other as the movie builds to its frenzied conclusion. There's a near-balletic beauty to much of the plotting as Costigan and Sullivan both struggle with the paranoia and fear that come from having to conceal their true identities from their colleagues at work and the love interest they unknowingly share on the side. One must credit Siu Fai Mak, who wrote the original screenplay - here skillfully adapted by William Monahan - for much of the film's success.Yet, despite its many virtues of script and performance, there seems to be something oddly lacking in ""The Departed"" - a kind of unity and focus that turned ""Goodfellas"" into an instant classic of the gangster film genre. The deliberately clipped editing, which results in abrupt, awkward transitions between individual scenes, gives the film a self-consciously hurdy-gurdy quality that seems more artifice than art. The dialogue is often more mannered than it needs to be, and Scorcese has done surprisingly little to make the Boston locale an integral part of the drama (think back to how Sydney Lumet's managed that feat in ""The Verdict""). The story is interesting, in and of itself, but we never find ourselves very deeply engaged in the fate of the characters, which is the last charge one could ever level against ""Goodfellas."" Moreover, even the violence in ""The Departed"" is handled much less effectively than it was in ""Goodfellas."" In the earlier movie, the violence - and even the threat of violence - was cringe-inducing, unsettling and disturbing, with the Joe Pesci character, in particular, keeping the audience in a state of dreaded anticipation throughout, but in ""The Departed,"" the blows land with very little impact, and the violence is really not much different from what one might find in any decently executed, garden variety action film.Perhaps it's unfair to keep making these constant comparisons to ""Goodfellas,"" a standard that, let's face it, very few directors would ever be able to live up to even on their best day of film-making. It's just that Scorcese set the bar so high, for himself as well as for others, with that film that his own failure to reach it inevitably seeps into our evaluation of his current product.A good film but not a great one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"great cast, script, and of course Scorsese's genius","Any fan of Scorcese's work will love this picture. I was a little worried that the cast would not hold up to Marty's genius, but the performances were great. I was most worried about Alec Baldwin and and Mark Wahlberg's performances, but after I saw the film I thought they gave some of the most memorable performance's in the film. The story starts off a bit slow and jumps from story to story a bit to often, but once the premise is established the movie is excellent. The plot can be confusing if you don't pay close attention, but if you're an avid Scorcese fan or just someone who appreciates great cinema, then this is a great movie to watch. This is the best movie I have seen in years. The writing was great, the director is a legend, the cast was incredible, and I think this may be my new favorite Scorcese picture.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Black humour and Head shots! Scorsese at his best....,"The Departed is the best movie I have seen in years. It's gripping, shocking and hilarious all in one movie. Like the best roller-coaster ride, one second you're laughing, the next you're 'Oh my God!' as something really shocking happens.Yes this movie is a remake of the classic Hong Kong 'Infernal Affairs.' I loved the original but somehow the movie seems to sit even better among the Boston Irish.The performances in this movie are all standout, the leads DiCaprio, Damon and Nicholson as well as the support Wahlberg, Baldwin, Sheen and Farmiga. It is their work which makes the Departed special and absolutely gripping. From the hilarious one liners thrown by Wahlberg's Dignam and Baldwin's Ellerby to the intense fear and vulnerability shown by DiCaprio's Costigan as he tries to survive in the world of Nicholson's colourful and terrifying Costello.Surely this movies deserves some acting nods at the Oscars? I would certainly recommend 'The Departed.' You do need to be prepared for Goodfellas type violence and language but if you can live with this then The Departed will be one of the best movies you have seen in a long time.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
What great acting,"I waited to see The Departed with antisapation and having just seen it my wait was not in vain.The acting in the movie was the tops, including Leonardo De Caprio, Matt Damon, and of course Jack Nicholson who is great in anything he appears in. Even the bit parts by Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin were outstanding. The problem I had with the movie was how similar DiCaprio and Damon looked in this movie, I got sort of confused as to who was who. This is a different kind of cop story and I am sure you will enjoy watching the artistry of this unit of actors in this fine movie. It is the best two hours I have spent in a long time, so go see this outstanding movie and you will certainly enjoy it as much as I did. This is Oscar material for sure.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Yeah buddy.....,"The answer is yes. This is a very good movie. Scorsese is back to his former form. Not that the Aviator and gangs of new york were bad movies, they're actually quit good movies, but not Scorsese good. The Departed is Scorsese good though.The story takes place in Boston which is a new field for Marty. It's actually quite refreshing. But when it all comes down the city doesn't really matter.In terms of acting there isn't much to say. Everybody does their job, and well. EVEN Mark Wahlberg and Matt Damon. Dicaprio has really become a talented actor. But Matt is probably the actor that surprised me the most in this movie. I'm not a big fan of his, but he really does a good job here. I expected nothing less from the legend Jack Nicholsen which is one of my favorite actors. And Alec Baldwin probably shows his best performance so far. All in all a GREAT cast.A great movie, Probably better than infernal affairs, but it is Scorsese after all. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Most of the time, foreign movies are reworked by American directors and it turns to crap. While I cannot yet comment on the original, if it's anything like this version, it must be pretty good. This is way above some of his best works, including Goodfellas and I LOVE Goodfellas. I couldn't believe he could top it but he did with this movie.

Masterpiece,"Departed, The (2006)**** (out of 4)I went and saw Martin Scorsese's latest film today and afterwards one thing jumped into my mind and that was the word masterpiece. From the time I first got on the internet I've always told people they shouldn't label a film a masterpiece for at least 10-15 years so you could see how a film would sink into you. However, I guess I'm going to have to break my own rule because I thought this film was absolutely flawless and it's certainly the greatest thing I've seen in a very long time. I had a top ten of this decade but this here jumps right at #1. I was a major fan of Scorsese's previous two films but this one here is vintage Scorsese. I really feel sorry for those who have to pick Oscar winners because this film is full of possible nominees.DiCaprio once again turns in a super performance and Matt Damon gives the best performance I've ever seen from him. Jack Nicholson is someone you can always expect greatness from and he delivers here again but it was great seeing a great performance from him outside of a romantic comedy. As with Scorsese, this legendary teaming has Nicholson doing vintage work. I'm sure Nicholson will get a Supporting Actor nod but you could also throw in Damon, Mark Wahlberg, Adam Baldwin and even Martin Sheen. In most Hollywood films the movie would spend too much time with Damon and DiCaprio but I thought it was a brilliant move to make this thing more of an epic and give all sorts of character detail to the supporting players. Sheen really shines the most and I'd probably give him a nod before Nicholson.I haven't seen the film this is based on so I'm not sure how much is the same or how much is different but I felt Scorsese grabbed you from the very start with Nicholson's narration cut to a beautiful camera shot and then, of course, The Stone's Gimme Shelter. Seeing the rise of Damon's character through the division was something else that really worked and I personally feel the film could have told more of his story at the start. When the two eventually get undercover I thought Scorsese showed his master's touch again. Most Hollywood films would have just set up several bang-bang scenes but this one here carried the suspense throughout. Little by little plot developments would occur and little by little Scorsese would build the suspense. I was a little worried about the 150-minute running time but the way everything was moving this here could have been doubled in length and still worked just as good.No spoilers here but I thought the ending was brilliantly played out. I can't remember the last time I watched a movie and thought it was over only to be hit upside the head with a complete and utter shock where I was asking myself if something really happened.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Fantastic,"Was desperate to see ""The Departed"" because it was the first time I was catching up on a Scorsese movie in US on release date. (I am from India). Making a 2 1/2 hr gangster flick is a very tough task. But there are so many twists and turns that are there in this flick that 2 1/2 hrs just passed by without my knowledge.Initially i took some time to get into the movie. But once you are there, you will get so involved with the characters that you actually feel whats going on with them. Screeplay was very tight and gripping. To actually make a movie about two guys who don't meet until the end, is quite an achievement. And the last half an hour was amazing. I saw quite a few reviews which said that the climax as not up to the mark. I totally disagree with them. The scene when DiCaprio is shot, the whole theater was shocked and I could hear the sounds like ""Oh!! My God""...Man it was amazing ....

"An Adaptation Of ""Infernal Affairs"" Finally Wins Scrosese An Oscar? The Clueless Academy","""Infernal Affairs"" is a superb film and so is this ingenious remake. I didn't think Scorsese could top two of his previous gangster masterpieces, ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"" but he has. This film has superlative performances by all the actors involved. The plot revolves around two moles, one who infiltrates South Boston's well known criminal organization and the other who infiltrates the police investigating the organization. Once it becomes known by both sides that these moles exist the cat and mouse fight for survival between the two begins. For years Scorsese worked with DeNiro which earned him a Best Actor Award for ""Raging Bull"". However Scorsese has been continuously snubbed for a Best Director and Best Picture Award which he has deserved many times over. Recently he has taken DeCaprio, an excellent artist, under his wing and finally the favor was returned. At last Scorsese has been rewarded for bringing out the best performances from his actors. This film does an outstanding job examining the mobster lifestyle, authority, politics and corruption. This film has masterful acting, directing, cinematography, editing and screenplay. It is one of the finest in it's genre and a bravura film by Scorsese. Bravo Academy! You finally got it right.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Masking Good and Evil,"The 2006 Academy Award winning director Martin Scorsese has brought us some of the greatest films of all time to American Cinema and stands as one of the greatest directors to ever live. With films like ""Raging Bull,"" ""Taxi Driver,"" Goodfellas,"" and more recently ""The Aviator"" and ""Gangs of New York."" Marty now has the best film of 2006 to add to that list of greats with ""The Departed.""""When you're facing a loaded gun, what's the difference?"" This is coldly and meticulously uttered by Boston Mob Boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). The significance of the memorable quote tells us that no matter who you are or what you've done; when death is staring you in the face, it takes no prisoners. Costello says this to a group of young impressionable kids and among these impressionable kids is Frank Costello's next and future pawn- the wise, savvy, charismatic, charming, and slick talking Colin Sullivan played by Matt Damon, who gives his best acting performance of his career on the heels of another great performance in Robert De Niro's, ""The Good Shepherd"". From the start we see Colin headed down a path of corruption and deception as he is groomed to become a spy in the Massachusetts State Police for Frank Costello and his Boston mafia. His counterpart, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), is a cadet who has been kicked out of the academy and the only way he will ever be able to serve the commonwealth is by going undercover and infiltrating Frank Costello's crew for Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen). Queenan and Staff Sergeant Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) are the only two people that know Billy is a cop. Academy Award nominee, Mark Wahlberg does a great job as the fast talking, always ready for anything, humorous cop that will make you think this is a comedy at certain points in the film instead of a thrilling drama. Dignam can be cold, callous, and most of all, a dirty cop like the rat he hunts for in SIU.As Billy and Colin rise in their respective fields, the tension mounts as suspicion in both the State Police and Costello's crew heats up in search for the rat(s). There are twists and turns in every direction. As they become more and more aware of each others presence the anticipation becomes almost unbearable as both look to find each other and take each other out to protect their own skins.The film brings in plot twist after plot twist and manages to maintain its structure thanks to a perfect script by Academy Award winner, William Monahan. The two opposing figures in the film- Colin and Billy- frantically search and scheme their way to the top all the while sharing a sexual relationship with a psychiatrist, named Madolyn. Both characters fall for her and both unknowingly become twisted in a love triangle that only she knows about, but has no clue how grave her situation is. The motives for each falling in love with the psychiatrist is something to pay close attention to. Look for the reasons Colin wants a girl, and look for the reasons Billy wants a girl. One is putting on an act at all times, and both men struggle to keep their identity in check.Costello puts fear in the heart of both Billy and Colin as he starts to question everyone around him as the heat is turned up on him. Jack Nicholson gives one of his greatest performances of his career, and an Oscar worthy one at that. The psychological fear and mind games that he plays with both Colin and Billy make them fear that their conscience might be getting the best of them. This is something to truly admire and become utterly stunned by as both actors do such a great job of portraying the paranoia. Costello is not your typical gang leader. He is upper class with a little L Street mentality still left in him. He like's to go and listen to the opera. He loves fine wines and lobster dinners (with a side of bloody hand that could make anyone queasy- especially the nervous wreck that is Billy Costigan.). He also doesn't mind indulging in a little annoying fly, that may be crossing his face at the wrong time, or even a little coke to set the mood so that he's comfortably numb. He has his flaws as every man does, but Frank doesn't recognize any weaknesses because he's just so good at making a habit of getting away with murder. The very deep characters surrounding Costello, along with Costello himself, make this a ""must see."" We watch the drama unfold as the pressure on both Colin and Billy mounts as their guilt of deception and criminal activity makes both men start looking for a safe way out. They realize they both can only take so much and neither sees a way out that doesn't result in death. Colin wants to become a political influence in the community as he goes to law school at nights while Billy just wants his identity back. Neither are able to depart from Costello as he has a strangle hold on their every day lives. This is where we see the characters become three-dimensional and where we start to gravitate towards the characters- good or bad. We see what they are and how far they've fallen. Their weaknesses make them so humane that it's impossible to not feel or root for them.As the body count rises and the pressure is turned up one notch at a time before the final standoff the film becomes mesmerizing. The shocking and surprising ending will leave some pleasantly surprised or some looking for answers and disappointed. For most directors this would be their crowning achievement, but for Martin Scorsese, it just another classic to add the resume.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
great movie,"I saw this movie yesterday, and think this movie is the best movie of the year in my opinion, Scorsese's will go to win the Oscar of better director and Leonardo DiCaprio will go win Best Actor in a Leading Role MAT makes one great Role and Alec Baldwin, Jack Nicholson too. this movie is better the Japanese movie. he acting of all the leads were legendary and they all looked very comfortable in their roles.

The Best Film of 2006,"""You accuse me once, I put up with it. You accuse me twice... I quit. You pressure me to fear for my life and I will put a f*cking bullet in your head as if you were anybody else. Okay?"" - Billy CostiganWalking into 'The Departed' the latest Scorsese picture I didn't know what to expect. The way it used to be, back in the 70s and 80s, was when Scorsese released a film you knew it was going to be spectacular and a contender for 'Best Picture'. Now, unfortunately, you cannot say the same thing. Besides blessing us with some of the Best American Films Ever Made (Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, GoodFellas), in his recent years some of his other films have been more than a little disappointing (Kundun, Bringing out the Dead, Age of Innocence, The Aviator). I wanted to think positive, and think maybe this could be on par with Scorsese's early efforts. Despite the talent of Jack Nicholson of the bad guy, I was pretty sure it was going to be good, but the same old disappointing stuff we got from him in recent years. But, when those ending credits started to roll, I realized, I could NOT have been more wrong. Believe most of the critics and myself when we say 'The Departed' is not just excellent, but a masterpiece, and one of the best films Scorsese has EVER made.'The Departed' is based on the superb 2003 Hong Kong thriller 'Infernal Affairs'. Remakes usually are inferior to their originals, but in this case, 'The Departed' is 10 times better than 'Infernal Affairs', featuring acting and direction that is literally 20 times better. Instead of Hong Kong, the story of the remake is set in Beantown, or Boston. An up and coming rookie cop with a criminal family history, Costigan (DiCaprio), is commissioned by his superior officers Captain Queenan (Sheen) and Sergeant Dignam (Wahlberg) to go on a secret undercover mission and infiltrate the crew of the charismatic yet incredibly violent crime boss, Frank Costello (Nicholson). At the same time, a street hood practically raised by Costello, Sullivan (Damon), is commissioned by Costello to go undercover and infiltrate in the Boston Police Department. The film quickly becomes a thrilling cat and mouse game of wits between Costigan and Sullivan, to see which of the two will come out victorious. Scorsese's riveting Boston crime drama also stars The War Zone's Ray Winstone as Costello's equally twisted #1 man, Mr. French, The Manchurian Candidate's Vera Farminga as a psychiatrist working for the Boston P.D., who forms a relationship with Colin, and Alec Baldwin as the sarcastic, easily-irritated, but constantly fun to watch police Lieutenant who tells Colin one of the benefits of getting married is that the other cops won't think you're a 'homo'.Analyzing the different aspects of this film, there is really nothing to complain about, but so much to praise. First off, the acting is perhaps the best out of any motion picture released this year. Jack Nicholson is absolutely outstanding not to mention bone-chilling in his supporting role as Frank Costello, creating what is his best 'bad-guy' yet. It will be virtually impossible for Nicholson to be denied an Oscar nomination for his work in this, seeing as though whenever he's on-screen he steals the film, even if he doesn't have lines. Matt Damon is magnificent in his role as the calculating gangster posing as Bostod P.D., but the real breakthrough and the finest performance of 'The Departed' is Leonardo DiCaprio. In a tour-de-force performance that gave me goose bumps, DiCaprio completely makes up for some of his lack-luster performances in the past and then some. I predict DiCaprio might receive another Best Lead Actor Oscar Nomination for his work in this, God knows he deserves it 100%. In smaller roles, Mark Wahlberg is hysterical and scene-stealing as the demeaning police Sergeant who always has some smart-ass nasty comment to say to someone. Martin Sheen is solid to say the least as the Police Captain, Alec Baldwin is quite humorous in a tiny role as the Lieutenant, and Vera Farminga is fantastic in her role as the precinct shrink. Rounding out the cast, Ray Winstone is perfect as one man no one wants to screw with, Mr. French, and The Shield's Anthony Andersen is merit-able in an almost unnoticeable role as another cop who works with Sullivan.William Moynihan provides a masterful screenplay which redeems him for the scattered and stilted screenplay he provided for 'Kingdom of Heaven'. The dialog in 'The Departed' never seems stiff, and most of the time it is laced with side-split-tingly funny yet gritty one-liners from both the criminals and the cops. The cinematography and film editing are astounding, but the real secret to the success of 'The Departed' is Martin Scorsese's breathtaking directing abilities. Scorsese outdoes himself with 'The Departed' which is as stylish as 'Raging Bull' and as entertaining and engrossing as 'GoodFellas'. Scorsese has been nominated seven Academy Awards for 'Best Director' and has never actually won, but mark my words, 'The Departed' is probably going to be the film he finally gets the trophy for. Not just because he's overdue, but because his surprisingly exceptional work in 'The Departed' is more than deserving.Out of all these nearly perfect aspects of the film, the only down-side is that the first fifteen minutes of the film aren't very gripping. No worries, though, the rest of the two hours and fifteen minutes fly by and will have you pinned to your seat. It's one of those films you don't want to end because you are having such a fun time in the movie theater. 'The Departed' is the best film of the year, thus far, and is a reminder of why we as a people go to the movies.

A terrific film. Always worth watching.,"Has there ever been a film with a better cast than this? I can't think of one. Comment if you can.

The music is awesome. Especially Shipping Up to Boston which is done by one of my all-time favourite bands @dropkickmurphys. The song was the perfect choice for the film and they played it at just the right times. The plot is ingenious and Scorsese directed it superbly. This film even managed to be better than Infernal Affairs, which is what this film was based upon. I love the opening scene with Jack Nicholson's monologue and it really set the film for what was to come. The film also had it funny moments (thanks to Mark Walberg).

For all you movie buffs out there, remember how we always say they don't make real movies anymore, movies with plots, and characters, and development, and story lines, and subplots, and just amazing direction...well this is finally a movie we can say reminds us of the good old days. THIS IS A PERFECT MOVIE, AND IF NOT, IT IS VERY CLOSE TO IT. So no talk about what its about, no talk about what happens blah blah blah...just go and watch the Departed and enjoy a true gem for its time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

best mob movie since scarface,"and I love mob movies. I loved this movie. When I think of mob movies, I think of the Godfather(s), Scarface, and Goodfellas, in that order. It's not the Godfather, but it is definitely a classic. The story is better than Goodfellas (yes, I know that was based on a real story, but this one seems more realistic). The violence and dialog are so much more satisfying than Scarface. You feel like the violence makes sense, and isn't there just to decorate the movie. And the characters are nearly as compelling as the Godfather. The acting (and writing) is so good, that I will be disappointed if there are not multiple Oscar wins for the cast and story. I could easily see ones for Nicholson and DiCaprio (and I normally don't like Leo).I'm not sure what the running time was, but if anything I felt the film was too short. It was paced well, and tidied things up nicely, but I felt like I wanted to spend yet more time with the characters to understand them. Imagine if you only got one movie to know who Vito Corleone was...And of course, the directing was A++. Scorcese is quickly becoming one of my favorite directors. W/o giving things away, some of the duality, and contrasts are brilliant. One guy has one phone which he switches the sim cards. Another has two phones, which he carries around openly.I can't wait to see this movie again!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Purest Scorsese,"The new classic crime thriller by the great Martin Scorsese who delights us with his impeccable gangster cinema, and with his masterful direction, which surprises us again with this great masterpiece headed by a very luxurious cast that are totally important with a Leonardo DiCaprio who is great, a young Mark Wahlberg who is literally perfect and one of the best villains in history Jack Nicholson who is absolutely outstanding, all this makes The Departed my favorite movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A triumph,"Scorsese spend a lot of years lingering on different projects. Gangs of new York was okay, The aviator was quite good but every fan of Marty was secretly hoping for a new crime flick from the master. And this is the one! The Departed is brilliant. Absolutely stunning. Like Goodfellas, it's one of those rare movies where everything just..works. The acting is amazing. I was never a big fan of Leo DiCaprio but the performance he gives in this changed that. His character is very well developed and you feel for him right away. Matt Damon gives a surprising turn as a underhanded moll infiltrating the police. And of course there is Jack Nicholson in a blistering performance. Jack radiates menace, madness and charisma as Irish mob boss Frank Costello. A true legend at work. And he hasn't lost his touch. There is a reason for his 12 academy award nominations. And for this he will undoubtedly get his thirteenth.In the supporting roles Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin deliver the goods. Wahlberg is a scene stealer with some of the best lines and he has fabulous chemistry with both Sheen and Baldwin. Ray Winstone also shines as Costello's right hand man, Mr French. His part in this movie is overlooked in many reviews. But it is a golden one.The crew knocked this out of the park once again. The camera-work looks effortlessly smooth and Thelma Schoonmaker's editing is impeccable. To top it off there is a very strong soundtrack with the indestructible Scorsese-favorite Gimme Shelter.The Departed is Scorsese rising back to the up. even though he was never really away.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

too many plot holes,"The plot of this movie has too many plot holes. In the beginning, Leonardo's character Billy has just graduated from the police academy and only spent six months in prison, yet he manages to convince the gang leader Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) that he's not a cop, and it is unbelievable that Frank easily believes him. Then, in every mission, Billy becomes a key figure. It is more reasonable in the original that Chan Wing-yan (corresponds to Billy) had been taken away while still in the police academy and been undercover for ten years, with Hon Sam (corresponds to Frank) been undercover for three years.And, It's unbelievable that despite Frank suspecting a mole several times, he never doubts Billy, who came from the police academy, had the most apparent suspicion. However , every time he can shake off suspicions.At the end of the movie, there is a chaotic shootout, and Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) emerges as the ultimate winner. It's impossible to discern what Scorsese intended to convey here. In the original version, besides telling an undercover story, it also conveyed the idea of giving bad people a chance to reform themselves. However, just when you are expecting the movie to convey its final message, it abruptly ends with this inexplicable shootout and the main characters are dead.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Such an accomplishment for even a man like Scorsese,"After watching this film, I can't ignore how this film compares with the rest of Scorsese's films. In my opinion, from what I've seen, this is Scorsese's best effort. The only films of his I've seen are this one, Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, and The Wolf of Wall Street; and in my opinion, this one tops all of those.Amazing acting by one of the greatest casts of all time, and all of the supporting characters such as Martin Sheen who plays an amazing role. Many beautiful shots and great camera work by the god Scorsese. Great script with almost no flaws at all. One of the most perfect scripts I've ever witnessed.

Might as well be a Christopher Nolan movie.,"What I mean by that is that it can get a bit confusing, not the plot but the dialogue. So many of the words and phrases in the movie I assume most average people won't have heard and the movie dose t care to explain what they mean, this leaves some of the conversations to be bland and boring. The first half of the movie is really there to build tension, which it does very well and it doesn't disappoint as the end of the movie is insanity, so much happens and your mind explodes with everything that just occurred. The acting didn't stand out to me, even with a extremely famous cast, it wasn't bad though. The tension is really what makes this movie good, you just want to know what's going to happen but it's delayed further and further making you keep watching.

"Divided Loyalties, Compromised Choices.","Plot Outline: A police plant tries to infiltrate a Boston gang-lord's crime empire, while the gang-lord's police mole tries to expose him.Talk about the proverbial 'film of two halves'!!Martin Scorsese's latest film ""The Departed"" is his loose re-working/ trans-location of the acclaimed Hong Kong thriller, ""Infernal Affairs"", which spawned two sequels, one of which was, effectively, a 'prequel'.When I saw the earlier film on the festival circuit some three years ago, I was bowled over, even more than I had been by John Woo's kinetic thriller, ""Hard-Boiled"" from some 10 years earlier. What made ""Infernal Affairs"" so special, besides the technical excellence of the production and the fast-paced, high-octane action, was its emphasis on characterisations: particularly in what I regarded as the key, indeed the only players of any necessary substance: Tony Leung as the police plant, and Andy Lau, as the crime-lord's mole.The problem with Martin Scorsese's 're-working', and, while I recognise that he is at liberty to expand the narrative to broaden the supporting characterisations, is the way he allows himself to be compromised by the star turns and the 'alternate agendas'.So, and in what I refer to as the first 'half' we get too much of: Jack Nicholson, (whose HK equivalent was, at best, a two-dimensional peripheral character), revelling in an excessive quota of 'Jack-isms': think 'The Shining'; ""Batman"", etc, etc. Alec Baldwin, in his latest incarnation of his 'Glengarry Glenn Ross'/'The Cooler' hard-man, seemingly revelling in his ever-expanding waistline; Leonardo Di Caprio, who had to be given plenty of opportunity to emote, his 'Aviator' Oscar play having fallen short. while Ray Winstone gets to drop the Cockney hard-man stunt in favour of its Bostonian equivalent.Then, just when I was about to doze off, having realised too late just why Martin Scorsese needed 140 minutes to tell his story, he cranked the gears up a few notches.Matt Damon's gang-lord's police mole realises he's got to move fast before Di Caprio's good guy undercover cop brings his (Damon's) employer's empire crashing down and, in a daring move, orders a police tail on the head of the police undercover unit, thus hoping to flush out Di Caprio: the resultant 10 minutes or so of breakneck, white-knuckle tension, even if it does rely too much on the original and 'The French Connection' for inspiration, is almost worth the price of admission alone,culminating as it does in a tragic death which ultimately precipitates a breakneck pace of cross and double-cross.This is where Scorsese really comes into his own, with the kind of frenetic, yet sure-paced action sequences not seen since the heyday of ""Goodfellas"". Pausing briefly to swiftly despatch Nicholson's crime-lord, (which couldn't have come too soon, in my opinion), he constantly keeps us guessing as to the next twist and turn of the tail, and which of the 'double agents' will eventually prevail, and at what cost.A 'film of two halves', indeed, and while the second 'half', of perhaps 50 minutes or so, probably contains more cinematic merit than most Hollywood productions of at least the past 5 years, ultimately this has to be seen as a missed opportunity for Scorsese.As with 'The Aviator', Scorsese seems these days to be compromised too much in his artistic 'vision', to such an extent that I don't believe that this is 100% the film he wanted to make. 'The Aviator' seemed to me partly an Oscar vehicle for Di Caprio's (admittedly fine) acting, and part Scorsese 'Citizen Kane' homage: granted it was, after all, a Di Caprio vehicle.Here, once again, it appears to me that far too much screen time is devoted to 'Jack-isms', and more (unconvincing) brooding Di Caprio 'emoting'. As if, 'the Aviator' pitch having failed, they'd make sure of it this time. The trouble is, while Di Caprio is certainly a fine actor, who, I believe has yet to achieve his peak, more often than not he's trying too hard in this film in what is an underwritten role, lumbered with often puerile dialogue.And, where acting is concerned, don't get me started on Alec Baldwin, (whose acting capabilities seem to decline in inverse proportion to his waistline), or to Mark Wahlberg's cardboard-cutout undercover sergeant 'character'. Matt Damon, who doesn't try too hard, almost reaches what for me was his peak of 'The Talented Mr Ripley' But it was good to see Ray Winstone doing a 'foreign' accent, for a change.Once again, Scorsese's choice of music was impeccable: And I so loved his apt placement of Roy Buchanan's sublime, bluesy guitar rendition of Patsy Cline's ""Sweet Dreams"".Would that all of Scorsese's moves had been as sure.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

And in the end Jack Nicholson, well you all know Jack, NO WORDS, he just has to be the best.... like always. So I am very pleased with this movie and I won't think twice about seeing it again.

Unbelievably gripping and a perfect cast.,"I wouldn't want to spoil one second of this perfectly crafted film by giving anything away and you should do the same when recommending it. Often the advertising hype and public frenzy about a movie proves to be ill-founded. However in the case of ""The Departed"" it was well deserved. Martin Scorsese drew stunning performances out of already incredible actors. The seamless dialog and high emotional intensity didn't let up for a moment. Nicholson was the ultimate sleazy sociopath mob boss and Damon portrayed the pretty-faced bad boy to perfection. DiCaprio continues to astound me with his deep complexity as an actor. I was quickly drawn into his precarious situations and often found myself literally holding my breath on his behalf while awaiting the outcomes. Even Wahlberg and Baldwin, though their roles are supporting rather than lead, maintain a powerful presence throughout. Oh, and let's not forget Martin Sheen(Where has he been, anyway?)excellently playing one of the lone good guys in the film. I am not generally a fan of violent gangster-type movies, and I admit to much cringing and eye-closing. But the story, the acting, the dialog and the edginess hooked me right off. Nicholson's voice-over in the first minutes introduce him as a man with a definite idea of who he is, where he belongs and what he wants out of life. The interactions are snappy and believable with a few really memorable volleys between Wahlberg and Baldwin. We actually had to pause the DVD at times in order to fully enjoy them lest we be still laughing instead of paying attention. I appreciated the non-Tarantino-like directing. Rather than making the violence twistedly funny there are humorous moments within an intense and violent story. And the scarceness of ""Naked Flesh"" kept the story true to its purpose. Well done, Mr. Scorsese.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Living a double life is not different either as a cop or a criminal when you are working undercover,"(Synopsis) The city of South Boston has been taken over by the Irish mob boss, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). The Massachusetts State Police Department has set up the Special Investigations Unit to collect evidence and put Costello and his men in jail. Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) has just graduated from the state police academy, and has been assigned to infiltrate Costello's gang by the unit chief. Billy joins the mob and begins to earn Costello's trust. Years earlier, Costello was able to get one of his men, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), to infiltrate the state police. Colin is assigned to the Special Investigations Unit, the same unit that is trying to take Costello down. The only problem for the police is that Colin keeps Costello informed as to what the police are about to do. Eventually, the police and the mob discover that a mole has infiltrated their ranks. Each man is living a double life where one misstep will mean life or death if he is caught.(My Comment) This was a noteworthy movie with many memorable performances. Jack Nicholson's performance as an evil psychopath will get him an Oscar nomination. Several others probably will also be nominated for this film. The movie is graphically violent and shows the dark side of crime. It shows what it takes to work uncover as a cop or as a criminal. Costello said, ""does it matter who is holding a gun to your head, it is all the same."" Both sides risk their lives every day. It is a long movie, but the time passes very fast.

pretty good adaptation,"quite good. a little more violent than the hk original though; Scorsese shock value which actually works. plus a bit more humor to spice it up. though i liked both movies, the original turned out to be more suspenseful while this one was the grittier drama. Mark Wahlberg steals the show whenever he's on screen. And his character wasn't even in the original movie. All the major actors did a splendid job. From Alec to Wahlberg, everybody turned in one of their most memorable performances. However, the role of the shrink is just pushing it. Just way too incredible that she's been sleeping with the two guys who are after each other.

"Good film, but certainly NOT Scorsese's best...","THE DEPARTED is a long and intriguing film where opposite rival bands infiltrate each other to gain inside scoop info. The guys who do the ""infiltration"" are Matt Damon, doing the bad guy on the good side, and Leonardo DiCaprio vice versa. The story develops slowly and you have to pay close attention to all the minor details because so much is given that you might lose some info. The bad guy of the story (Jack Nocholson )doesn't appear to be all that mean and bad. In fact, you don't feel much for any of the characters, except maybe for DiCaprio's. This aside, the movie moves at a fair pace, although the beginning is a bit slow. By the time the movie's over you hardly notice what's going on. This is a finely crafted movie, big budget and stuff and a fine Martin Scorsece film, but, in my humble opinion, don't think it deserved a best movie award. I think most of you out there will agree with me that Scorsece has done way better in the past: TAXI DRIVER, CASINO, GOOD FELLAS, RAGING BULL, etc. I think the Academy felt so wrong and sorry for not awarding ANY of his past movies that they just had to give him an award this time around.

My favorite film!,"I finally saw the long-awaited classic film from Scorsese. This is one of the best films in the last decade and I am still having a personal discussion with myself on comparing it with some of the my ultimate favorites such as Goodfellas, Casino, Rounders, A Bronx Tale, The Deer Hunter and I am pondering even ranking it higher than my top 3 films the first two godfather's and taxi driver. I think i will need to watch it a couple more times before making such an important decision, but after seeing it once, one thing is for sure, The Departed is a masterpiece. Everything put together by Marty in his own perfect stylistic fashion. The violence is perfect, the cursing is perfect, the actors absolutely committed. Nicholson, Wahlberg, and Dicaprio check in for 3 of their best performances of their careers (and thats saying a lot for nicholson whose had an amazing career). Matt Damon was also good here, a bit subtle and overshadowed by his peers, but nonetheless always convincing. Vera Farmiga was charming and very good in the female lead. Alec Baldwin, Ray Winstone and Martin Sheen were perfect in their selective small roles as well. Marty did a great job with this one.

Should have been better,"Organized crime, organized crime fighting. Corrupt policemen and undercover agents. They seem to be connected at the hip and this film plays with that from the start to the very last minute of it, telling the tale of the actions of a FBI/police combination fighting to bring a hotshot criminal down. Apparently it is a remake of the Japanese film Mou gaan dou (2002). I have not seen that original but will be on the lookout for it now.The Departed is intense. A tad slow in the beginning and maybe a little too fast in the ending, but I guess keeping a very good balance in a 150 minute film can be a very daunting task. The most of it is rather interesting and builds a tension that runs somewhere until the last 15 minutes of the film - but - that is where it all fails. For me the last 15 minutes of film feel glued to the rest but not really connected to that rest and that more or less breaks the film in half, destroying its quality.All in all.

Martin's best ever...,"I haven't voted ""10"" for a movie before - I've always felt that giving a ""10"" rating is that's like saying there's no room for improvement, and there are always elements that could have been done better. And no matter what you're doing, there's always room for improvement. But this was a definite 10. The pacing, the plot, the characters, the performances... This was a terrific movie. There's no doubt that in the future The Departed will be the new benchmark for this genre.The cast is brilliant. I have always been a fan of Nicholson, and here he is even better than usual. Some say he is too over-the-top, but I disagree. The character he plays is himself over the top, and I think it is a perfect performance. Damon's Colin Sullivan is a stunning picture of evil. A man with terrific abilities and, the way he looks to that golden dome, a man with dreams of other better things, but he is so hooked into his patron that he can't get out, and in the end embraces the entanglements as what his life is. Leonardo is such a classic tragic figure in this. Unbelievable... To be willing to sacrifice himself in this way. I think it shows a more realistic picture of what this kind of double life must be than anything I have seen.Every supporting character is just as flawlessly portrayed.

Good Movie,"""The Departed"" was good but not excellent. Jack Nicholson hammed it up through most of the movie. If he had less screen time I would have thought he made the movie but there was too much of him being too much. Matt Damon portrayed the nasty little sh!t I always thought was in him. He was great. Leonardo DiCaprio was also very good portraying the mental stress I would think a mob mole would have. Mark Wahlberg could have been a bit over the top but I think his character's personality evolved from working with big ego macho cops and, for me, he was very believable. Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone were good in their supporting roles. Vera Farmiga was OK. I guess I didn't believe her as a therapist. I think she need a bit more meat, emotionally, and as the girlfriend, physically. I didn't see the original, ""Infernal Affairs"" so I can't compare the two. This version's story, especially towards the end, seemed rushed and forced to finish with the big gun battle but the mechanics of the movie's cop story was secondary to the story of the two moles. If the movie is examined for the story of the cops trying to get Jack Nicholson it comes up short but the mole parallel story was intriguing and Matt and Leo were great. It was a violent movie and the ending was a bit much. Well worth seeing but not Scorsese's best. His best are icons, ""Raging Bull"", ""Taxi Driver"", ""Mean Streets"".

Scorsese back to form,"The Departed (2006) Dir: Martin ScorseseRating:If you like good things... go see this film. Scorsese's best film in years.What's Good About It:They say that people elevate the level of play if they believe in their coach, (Which is evident this year in the miracle that is the Detroit Tigers) and it is evident that every one of these actors (great in their own right) upped every ounce of their game for Scorsese. Scorsese is back to what he does best, (after more than a decade since Casino) and he shows that he hasn't lost any of his balls in the decade, despite the scientific likelihood that his ability to procreate has decreased with age. Anyways, despite a couple things I didn't like on his end, this film was gloriously directed, with the pace of a healthy bowel movement (slow and steady with spurts of speed and spatter). It also brings back a lot of the directorial instinct I liked from Taxi Driver, and haven't really seen him explore again. Some people say that being a child, and being elderly are very similar, and I hope that this is the beginning of Scorsese's second childhood, where he re-finds what made him a unique voice to begin with.OK, the acting in this film is some of the most top notch acting by a group of individuals I have seen in a long time. They don't act like an ensemble (ie United 93) which is what made the film a lot better, all were individuals who were after their own goals, and all even appeared to have their own mini film within in the film. It's something that doesn't work very often unless you get the right mix of actors, and this mix of actors is glorious, all of which I would love to work with.I would love to write a paragraph on all of them from Ray Winstone to Alec Baldwin to Kevin Corrigan but that would take FOREVER... so I will talk about the highlights. Finally... FINALLY!!! someone cast Leonardo DiCaprio in a role that he was suited for, I didn't like him as 'Howard Hughes' in the The Aviator, I thought there were dozens of actors better suited for that role that Leo (I am not saying that he was bad, he just didn't have the tools or the look). I am of the belief that Leo gets miscast more than any other actor, just because people really wanna have Leo in their films, and in only 1 out of 4 films is he ever cast correctly (Such as; Catch Me If You Can, Titanic being the reason people wanna cast him and do so incorrectly for everything he was casted in before this i have no qualms with) I think Leo really defined himself as an adult actor with this role, before he was playing roles that he was still coming of age, or still the young kid. This was an adult role that he took and hit out of the ballpark, out of the number of Oscar nominations I assume this film will get, his will be one that was actually deserved (not to take anything away from the rest of the film, its just a film that the academy will over praise... I am sure).I was happy to see Martin Sheen kickin it again on the big screen, and he was great. The team up with Mark Wahlberg's character made for some of the most memorable portions of the film. Both these actors are actors that I have enjoyed for a while, and I am happy to see them both doing something other than The Italian Job 12 (Wahlberg) and small screen fare (Sheen).That will be all that I go into detail about what is good, for there was so much that I can't really get into it all unless I write an epic... and I don't write epics unless its about 'poo' or 'holes in my shoes' so I shall move on to...What Was Bad:I am going to go out on a limb and say Jack Nicholson. He is so close to brilliance in this film, but I feel it crossed over into ridiculous cartoonish evil. Really I hate to say it, because there is so much to like about the performance, but I even feel that the film makers saw what I saw, and his part in the film feels edited down (also from the information I have read in interviews, and other literature on the film). Though I will give him praise for taking risks in his character (for there were many), because there isn't enough risk taking in Hollywood today, and it was great to see a well established actor (who is known for taking risks) take some.Also I will say this, and I won't write any spoiler, though it doesn't hold a bearing on the story... the last frames of the film, almost ruined it for me... They did something I despise, and that is toss in a simple ass visual metaphor and symbolism just so that the idiot average film goer can think he figured out a ""subtle"" insinuation from the film maker... when and if you see the film you will know what I mean... it's literally the last frames of the film before the creds.Epilogue:If you like any Scorsese, see this film. If you like any Quentin Tarantino (specifically Reservoir Dogs), see this film. BUT DON'T TAKE YOUR MOM'S OR YOUR KIDS!!! This film is rough... so show it to people judiciously.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Is this as a result of my devotion to Scorsese? I have read some posts that point out this scene as ridiculous, and I am just wondering what the consensus is on that particular issue? Alec Baldwin gave yet another incredible performance, almost on par with his movie stealing acting from Glengarry Glen Ross. The other thing I could see someone not hopelessly devoted to Scorsese taking issue with was the scene in which Costello's guy died on the couch before revealing Costigan as a bad guy. That seemed a little bit ridiculous. The violence in this film was done beautifully I thought, and yet I read some conments stating that the part where Martin Sheens character hits the ground and his blood sprays up on Costigan as looking fake. I could not disagree more, I though it looked quite realistic. Am i completetly blindfolded by my respect for Scorsese?",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Informants number exaggerated.,"The way of Billy's infiltration to gang group was so foolish. What is more annoying more than this is the leader of gang group accepted Billy after a very short testing and took him in the main operational gangsters' group for no reason. 
Secondly Lazio mostly uses abusive language and the chief of Lazio expects the officers and most probably the audience to accept it. The language in his role was unnaturally showy.
Number of informants and the battle of different departments of enforcement agencies each other on these informants are so exaggerated. The gang leader even appeared as FBI informants at the end of the movie.😁 It is the most silly part of the movie. 
In terms of players' acts and cinematography, the movie is outstanding and worth to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Just as the nay sayers said,"This movie sucked big time. I agree with all of those who complained about the abusive and unrealistic cursing, specially when coming from the cops. It makes no sense that educated people whose job it is to run investigations would keep talking like that all the time. But even if you choose to suspend disbelief on that matter, there are just too many inconsistencies to be able to let yourself taken in for the ride. Other viewers have described them very well, so I thank them for saving me the time. I also felt a great disappointment since I used to think that Martin Scorsese was a great director. Well no more I guess. Just another big commercial production which just doesn't fly...

"This time, they gotta give Martin Scorsese an Oscar.","The 79th Annual Academy Awards will run tomorrow night, and ""The Departed"" is one of the Best Picture nominees. All that I can say is that they have to award Martin Scorsese this time. ""The Departed"" hits you like I have almost never seen in a movie. It is an absolutely great movie in terms of the acting.First, we get narration from aging mafioso Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). He's been pragmatic about many things throughout his life, but he's never given up his life of crime and being one of the nastiest people whom you could imagine. Then, there's Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), joining Boston's police force but secretly infiltrating the mafia. Next, there's Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), one of Costello's acolytes secretly infiltrating the police. Add psychologist Madolyn (Vera Farmiga) to the mix, and you have a practically explosive situation.One thing that you should understand about this movie is that almost every character is a total creep and there are basically no good guys; Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) is particularly bad. With all these characters being so vile, it is no surprise that we see violence and brutality that movies almost never show. It's the sort of stuff that makes you feel like the characters are pounding your face in. Don't be surprised if you walk away from ""The Departed"" feeling very shaken up. And you'll probably never want to be a cop after watching this.Anyway, I say that even if they don't give the movie Best Picture, they gotta give Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar. His direction is top notch (as is almost every other aspect of the movie). I wholeheartedly recommend it. Also starring Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin and Kevin Corrigan.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Without a Doubt, The Movie of the Year in 2006","I saw The Departed last night, and already expecting a great movie I got even more: the BEST movie. I officially declare this the best movie of 2006, without a doubt.Jack Nicholson plays an Irish mafia boss, who is hunted by a rat in his mob. He also has a gang member who is a rat in the police department. The two rats do not know about each others' double identities. With Matt Damon, Leo DiCaprio, Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg and more...What is great is not just the great double embedded story, but the way the two chase each other without knowing who to target. And the acting is phenomenal.Jack Nicholson returns as a villain and is the most evil and ruthless he's ever been (compare to ""Batman"" or ""The Shining""). DiCaprio is intense, and delivers some of the best fight scenes captured on film. You will believe assault can be an art form. Matt Damon is in top form. Wahlberg is the most Irish you'll ever see him. And Martin Sheen is the father figure he obviously wasn't in real life.I want to pay special attention to the music. Twice, they use the Dropkick Murphys' cover of Woody Guthrie's ""I'm Shipping Off to Boston"". Once when Leo goes to jail and again later when the mafia marches into battle. This tune is loud, intense and violent... pure perfection. Scorsese could have just used incidental music, but he knows when to get a modern rock song and this was one of those times.Go see this movie and love every minute of it, just like I did.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

In Infernal Affairs the same character is a conflicted man torn between loyalties and gains the audience's sympathy. In the new film you hated Matt Damon and felt nothing about supporting characters. It's really too bad. Scorsese's movie would have been better if the characters gained our sympathy like the original.....that was the purpose of the film.

A Deeply Absorbing Masterpiece by Scorcese,"This film employs a brilliant plot device of parallelism, by contrasting two characters, one an undercover cop working to do good, with another character, a cop who appears to be pristine and ethical, but has actually been planted to rise to the highest levels by the arch criminal and tragic (Greek) figure Jack Nicholson.Thus, the storyline follows classic elements of Greek drama over the course of nearly three hours. Yes, it's about Boston crime; yes it's about a Boston crime figure who flourished for years by informing to the FBI on his rivals, thus eliminating the competition, which the FBI willingly turned a blind eye to for decades; and yes, it's a film with dozens of great actors, spot on directing & writing, and epic, Greek Tragic Dramatic level story arcs and resolutions.One of cinemas' great achievements.A beautiful, brilliant transcendent film, luminous in its perfection.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Not as good as Infernal Affairs,"Having seen Infernal Affairs, I had expectations that were perhaps unrealistic. The 2002 film from Hong Kong had action and depth. The writers of The Departed took an excellent story and expanded it. The additions made added nothing to the story, in fact they detracted from the main characters' struggles. The expansion of the mob boss character only served to highlight Jack Nicholson. While I enjoy Jack as much as the next person, the story is more about Costigan and Sullivan and their struggle with each other and their own demons. I will admit that the acting was very good. Unfortunately, a great cast does not necessarily mean a great movie. Scorsese was over the top in terms of the violence and side stories. All in all, I was very disappointed. I expect American audiences will be pleased enough.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Bad acting, non-existent character development, confusing plot.","First of all, I must say this is THE worst Martin Scorsese movie I have ever seen. I usually like Scorsese's movie, but this one is the first one I have encounter that totally blow me away in its awfulness.My first problem with The Departed is the casting. They got a bunch of baby-face fruitcakes like Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Anthony Anderson and Mark Wahlberg which totally throws the suspension of disbelief out of the window. It is like watching a bunch of boy scouts playing cops and robbers - None of them look like cops - more like boy scouts.Secondly, the acting, is just wooden. There is no subtlety in the acting, and they try to cover that up by over-acting, and constant swearing. (Perhaps it is to make them look more ""mature"" for their part.) Now, about the plot, it is pretty thin, and confusing at times, lacks clarity or resolve. The several scenes made me cringe, particularly when Jack Nicholson tries to torture Leonardo DiCaprio, it just seems totally unbelievable after Jack Nicholson violently tortured DiCaprio and he trusted him AGAIN!!Now, about Matt Damon's acting in this movie, it is pretty god damn bad. In fact, what acting!!?? Matt Damon just doesn't emote at all!! He is as souless and as wooden as a robot. It is extremely wooden as if he is the living proof that Pinocchio exist!Leonardo's acting is more of his usual self, pretty boy in distress with endless whinings to anyone who would lend his ears to him - but in this movie, he seems particularly out of place. The character development lacks subtle internal conflicts presented in the original character so involving and multi-dimensional.Jack Nicholson is just his usual sly scoundrel self. Totally uninspiring acting. Same goes with Martin Sheen's super stiff acting. Anthony Anderson is totally mis-casted in this movie as if he is a comic relief (and yet there is nothing comic about it)The character development and inter-character dynamics are almost non-existent between the two rivaling characters (Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon) it is as if they are in two separate movies. The movie not only lacks any subtlety but blatantly plays up the caricatures of what we perceived as ""mafia"" - loud mouth constantly swearing goons - it is both extremely cliché and uninteresting.The plot is also pretty confusing due to extremely bad direction, it lacks focus, and the camera work is also chaotic and uninteresting.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Departed Review,"""I don't want to be a product of my environment. I want the environment to be a product of me."" - Frank CostelloA remake of the Hong Kong thriller, Infernal Affairs, The Departed is once again yet another crime masterpiece that deals with identity and deception, and it's all done in such style that only Scorsese can pull off.Set in contemporary Boston, it follows Irish Mob boss Frank Costello who plants a mole within the Massachusetts State Police while, at the same time, the police sends an undercover cop to infiltrate Frank's organization. Eventually, both sides realizes what's going on and both moles race to identify each other before their covers are blown.In an age when remakes are often inferior to the original, there comes a remake where it takes the original concept and gives it its own unique style, and this is no exception. From its moving cameras, to its cinematography, Scorsese incorporates his own style into this film and gives it a gritty and tense feel to it. The editing, for the most part, moves at a steady and flowing pace, even if some moments where the editing moves frantically.The two major themes the movie deals with are identity and deception. Both moles are simultaneously trying to discover who each other are, but, at the same time, trying to blend into an environment they aren't originally from without revealing their true motives. It's also noted that both men, despite being different from each other, constantly competing in a similar manner is so clear and strong that it makes for some really intense moments.These intense and emotional moments wouldn't be possible without its star-studded cast, and each one delivers. Leonardo DiCaprio puts on a captivating performance as Billy Costigan, Matt Damon is great as Colin Sullivan, and, of course, Jack Nicholson, who might be the best performance in the movie, is outstanding as Frank Costello.Overall, The Departed is an excellent thriller. Emotionally gripping, thematic, and elegantly cinematic, it's one of Scorsese's best films and it's one of the best pieces of cinematic art.Final Verdict: 9/10 with an Epic Seal of Awesomeness.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Johnny Sal Approved! Amazing Film,"The Departed is an Amazing Film. I found the film contained good dialog, shot composition, and lighting as well as fantastic editing by Thelma Schoonmaker. Not as long as Gangs of New York (2002) but it still contains the action and clever plot twists and general excitement found in most Scorsese pictures.The Departed is authentic, captivating and heart felt. I predict Globe and Oscar nominations for Mark, Matt, and Lenonardo. Martin Scorsese's brilliant mind as a director shows up in this work of art and he better get the Best Director Oscar. He has worked for too long and too hard his entire career and has yet to receive one. Possibly best supporting actor for Alec Baldwin, or Martin Sheen. I rate this film 10 out of 10, a superb masterpiece of ""Crime Art"" as i call it.

Why a meaningless and unbelievable subplot?,"I must have read a dozen reviews of ""The Departed"" by professional critics. No one, however, has pointed out the utter meaninglessness of the 20-minute subplot--quickly discarded--involving the selling of mysterious microprocessors to agents of the government of China. It's beyond belief to ask an audience to believe that a local mobster into loan sharking, drug dealing, and the usual local mobster fare would delve into far murkier international intrigue. I guess Scorcese must have had second thoughts, too, since this whole sequence was dropped like a hot potato, not to be mentioned again. Further, and oddly, too, the agents of the Chinese government are seen speaking Cantonese, not Mandarin.Was the subplot a big mistake or was it an expensive tip-of-the-the-cap to the movie's Cantonese origins?

"Cops and Criminals, what's the difference?","Taxi Driver was hailed at the movie of the seventies; Raging Bull was the film of the eighties; Good Fellas was the film of the nineties; now in this decade, Martin Scorsese returns to his mafia roots, not in New York or New Jersey, but brings his mafia to Boston where in this update of Infernal Affairs it's mean, violent, frightening with full of surprises, and Jack is Back making The Departed Martin Scorsese's definitive film of this decade.""When you're faced with a loaded gun...what's the difference?""In The Departed, Leonardo Dicaprio and Matt Damon play different sides of the law that go in the opposite directions in their careers; Leo is Billy Costigan, a smart recruit who flunked the academy but is hired by Capt. Queenan (Martin Sheen) and the foul-mouth Sgt. Dignam (Mark Whalberg) to go undercover inside mob boss Frank Costello's (Jack Nicholson) team and get any information; Matt is Colin Sullivan who is not only a smart prodigy to Frank, but once he is promoted to the Special Unit Investigations leaded by Capt. Ellerby (Alec Baldwin), it's up to Colin to make sure that he gives Frank the early step.In a game of cat and mouse, both sides of the law want to find out who the mole is in their operative sources while at the same time both William and Colin are taken in by the father-son figures of their work with Frank thinking of William as a son despite his henchman Mr. French (Ray Winstone) breaking him down. Just like most movies, there is always the love interest. Vera Farmiga who is unknown to a lot of general film freaks like myself plays the police psychiatrist who falls in love with Colin's Suffolk education attitude while she sees Billy as her patient and falls for both characters despite not knowing that both are undercover operatives.Everyone gives top notch performances, but everybody knows that the one who steals the show is none other than Jack Nicholson's Frank Costello. Nicholson's performance as Costello brings back the devil's grin that made everybody loved villains in the first place; compared to the sadistic Bill the Butcher from Gangs of New York, Jack's performance is one that people will be talking about and reenacting.On another note about the film, the editing of the film is top notch with Thelma Schoonmaker giving it all she's got bringing energetic life to the movie.

"""Honesty is not synonymous with truth...""","Cocky Boston police detective with the Special Investigations Unit--who, as a young man, was mentored by a drug kingpin, an overgrown thug who is still making everyone shake in the old neighborhood--is still in-cahoots with this mob boss and attempts to ferret out the police cadet whose job it was to infiltrate the bad guys' circle and get hired on. In turn, the cadet--who is frustrated by his lack of identity--must find the spy on the police force who is playing both sides. Big Oscar winner from director Martin Scorsese is an Americanization of Hong Kong's ""Mou gaan dou"" from 2002. It is also very typical of this particular filmmaker: flashy, fast-moving, repugnant and yet reveling in its nastiness--to the point where one nearly feels the rampant ugliness and constant homophobia gets the director's seal of approval. As the undercover cop, Leonardo DiCaprio does some of his finest work yet; although he can't do much with the man-woman stuff involving a perplexing Public Service psychiatrist, DiCaprio is convincingly rough in a very difficult role to pull off. As the bad detective, Matt Damon is also first-rate, bravely playing a real pr*ck while giving the picture a smug swagger that suits the narrative well (I would have preferred more about this character's loss of morals however, which happens entirely off-camera). As the drug-lord, Jack Nicholson performs without vanity and slithers through the movie like a smiling cobra; his unpredictability as an actor is tailor-made for this role, and Scorsese is careful not to overload the screen with Jack (we get just enough of him, although one sequence in a porno theater goes over-the-top).

Scorsese did a good job remaking an awesome movie,"Most of the people who went to see the Departed, didn't know anything about the movie ""Infernal Affairs"". A great Chinese movie (part one of a trilogy), that left viewers yearning for more cop thrillers like these. Although no one actually thought of an US Remake. But if you make an American version, at least use a great director. Which they did, with Scorsese.The story isn't exactly copied from the Chinese Original, but you get many high points from the Original. And some shock moments, might not shock you as much as they did with people, who haven't seen the Original. Some roles are also changed here. And here comes a funny fact (it might be written here on IMDb somewhere), that of one Jack Nicholson, who changed his role and the script as they went along with the filming. And even if his co-stars didn't mind (at least they didn't say otherwise), Ballhaus (cinematographer, DP) wasn't amused! And it seems as if this incident (like changing the whole set-up for a scene, just for Nicholson and lighting kind of everything, just to be sure to have Jack's spontaneous outbursts on film) causes Ballhaus considering, not working with Scorsese anymore.But that's just behind the scenes. What matters is the result on screen. And that is good enough to watch. After reading the Oscar nominations, one could feel, that it might be Scorsese time. And although it's not his best film he ever made, Scorsese was overdue for an Academy Award!.

His departure lasted way too long....but he's back!,"The man spawned legions of imitators and followers, some good, some bad, and some terrible. His style is unrivaled, his violence over the top, his language, coloured, but his expertise, unparalleled. The man has never been recognized by the Academy, and for a crime like that there are no words. But what the man does best is not win awards; it's the gangster movies. And oh how long it's been since we saw one.Martin Scorcese is back in the vein that made him great, the vein where he revealed a whole new style of film making, a style imitated by many young talents in the industry today, such as Quentin Tarantino. He's respected like no other, and he shows why in his latest gangster movie, his first in 10 years, 2006's masterpiece ""The Departed"".Starring a cast that fires on all cylinders, never slacking in any department, it is a remake of the Hong Kong thriller ""Infernal Affairs"", transposed to a Bostonian setting in which gang business plagues the city, and investigations on the reigning crime lord, Frank Costello (expertley portrayed by Jack Nicholson in a scene-stealing role), always seem to turn up empty. Enter new State Police officer Billy Costigan (an Award deserving Leonardo di Caprio), a man with a troubled past. His assignment: to lose himself in the world of organized crime and become an undercover unit in Costello's gang.However, not is all as it seems, with Costello having his own spy within the State Police, a rat of a cop, Colin Sullivan (well played by Matt Damon) who is sent to find the undercover within Costello's crew.It's a deadly game of cat and mouse, where one false move could mean certain death for either party involved.The story is excellent and engrossing, but the real star here is not only the actors, but the style. That's Scorcese's bread and butter: the style. Expertly cut and crafted, every shot seems as though it's cool, without even being overly remarkable.Martin Scorcese has been dabbling in styles unfamiliar to him. While well respected by the Academy (though still never winning, I believe John Stweart summed it up best) it was a departure from his career making mold. This isn't always a bad thing, as Steven Spielberg has slowly undergone a metamorphosis into a very different director than he began as, however, for Scorcese, his newer movies just didn't feel right.All that changes with ""The Departed"". A crowning achievement for the dismal year of 2006, and definitely a contender at Oscar time.Perhaps maybe, justice will be served, and Scorcese will finally get his due.

That's this film.It plays out like a slick mystery novel - everything revolves around the narrative and everything happens to conveniently fit perfectly in place.While this isn't bad necessarily it comes at the expense of the characters being more interesting. Even with the all star cast line up it doesn't do much to give anything more than a cardboard cut out for the characters.How this won an academy award is certainly a wonder. Either the competition that year was terrible, or the judges simply looked at the names in the credit roll and felt like in order to keep their jobs they had to vote for it.The movie opens up laboriously slow trying to give you a background and history of the main characters, but what it fails to do is make you feel connected to the characters - it comes off slow and trite. It's just too forced and almost feels like a soap opera for the first 15-2 minutes.The major low in the film is when Billy somehow is supposed to fall in love with Madolyn and vice versa. The movie makes about as much effort to sell you on it as a bad porno. IE: Therapist girl gives one session with Billy, kicks him out. And then somehow a few scenes later they're knocking boots. It was just so terribly unrealistic or believable, but then again most other things in this film are. Now film works by the viewers suspending but this film just fails to really engage the viewer with the characters which would then allow you to suspend belief. So many things in this film come off as trite.Overall a watchable film but despite it's all star line up it's a very forgettable film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Not Really My Thing,"I'm not into a lot of Martin Scorsese movies mainly because hardly any of his characters are likable or even relatable and the Departed is no exception. Sure, it's well acted, well directed and well written, but I don't get a lot of enjoyment out of shitty people acting like shitty people. Just a really unpleasant experience all around. If you're into dark, twisting thrillers about horrible people give it a watch. If you're like me, however, and prefer a protagonist you can actually root for you're out of luck here.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"A testosterone-fuelled turn, The Depahted","Two newly-graduated police officers Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) are hired by the Massachusetts State Police, one to simultaneously infiltrate the Irish mafia lead by the colourful Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) and one to investigate leaks within the bureau. Their respective tasks parallel each other at all times, but they never meet. Cue intrigue en masse, coated with tense cat-and-mouse games and green-and-white Irish culture in Boston, making The DepAHted something of a Goodfellas lite.This is, essentially, all that is achieves. For a 'Best Picture' nominee, The Departed lacks heart and makes up for it by trafficking in violence, suspense and swearing. The aforementioned naturally gets it a long way with most people, and indeed even with me, but since Martin Scorsese is incapable of making a film shorter than two and a half hours, the substance stretches thin. I'm no math whiz but things simply do not add up to a complete film. Much like in Goodfellas, The Aviator and Gangs of New York, Scorsese gets so taken with the setting and atmosphere that he positively dawdles on scenes and the majority of these serve no other function in the story than to get us a feel for the way--and the venality--with which things are run.The acting, by contrast, is actually good. Jack Nicholson may simply be rehashing his psycho-Jack routine but it works as well as ever and he chews scenery whenever he is on screen. Leonardo Dicaprio inhabits something of a lead role in the film, but his acting regimen consists of shouting as loudly as he can. Billy Costigan is a difficult character to capture the nature of, for he is both contradictory and confused, jockeyed between the Irish mafia and his allegiance to the police department. Matt Damon's slick character Colin Sullivan is a joy to watch as he ""rises faster than a twelve year old's dick"" in his career, but much credit is also due to Mark Walhberg's streetsmart Dignam who is given some excellent and brilliantly funny dialogue in the script, such as the latter observation about Sullivan. The only problem is that he is at the mercy of a grossly underwritten character.The big problem that The Departed has is that its story rotates around genuinely unlikeable anti-heroes. I'm not even sure if they'd qualify as heroes, for these are characters with good qualities that are so distant that you need binoculars. It is difficult to slot them in protagonist/antagonist positions because while Sullivan is corrupt and selfish, he is funny, charming and we follow him from childhood. Costigan, by contrast, lacks all the enjoyable theatricality of his polar character and comes across as whiny, moody and desperate in his actions but certainly he is morally right in the film, and quite firmly on the side of good in spite being taken under the wings of Nicholson the mob boss himself.Without likable characters a wide array of problems follow, but the direction, pace and action of the film cleverly mask most of these. Who cares that all women are hookers (often literally)? Who cares that these is product placement by the bucketload? And who cares that the ending is one huge mess? The fact is that Martin Scorsese knows how to craft a compelling film, and much of this expertise has translated into an enjoyable crime cop drama with Boston accents and slang that snap and crackle like kindling in a fireplace. Ultimately, the actors sing tunes we have all heard before and the story may be intricately-sketched but we have been down this road before, so this is nothing revolutionary. And where, pray tell, is the tracking shot?!7- out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

What a Disappointment! .. The Departed Goes Actually Nowhere!,"What a Disappointment! .. The Departed Goes Actually Nowhere! I'm not saying the movie is awful but it isn't great .. yeah, there's a big load of excitement but I think it is too big for the movie to handle it and most parts of the movie aren't even, it is an OK at its best .. Martin Scorsese did cast a bunch of Hollywood's class ""A"" Actors and he was relying on the good performances that they could give to empower the movie but unfortunately they all were So-So except for Mark Whalberg who gave an OK performance but his little role didn't give him a chance to do any better .. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance was bad & disappointing .. so is Matt Damon. Nicholson's performance is OK but not at his best.What I miss in that movie is the depth .. I feel like if it is a cheap thriller movie with a great excitement but it makes no sense sometimes. I felt that the movie is disconnected and not very solid!!! When you read most of the reviews that praising the movie .. you feel that it is the movie of the millennium or of the year .. but actually The Departed goes nowhere .. it was going to be an OK thriller that you watch and forget about it the next day until the horrible ending blew up all the ""OK"" work .Martin Scorsese did a great job on cinematography but he didn't give a depth to his exciting story. I'm a big fan of Scorsese's .. Martin Scorsese has directed great movies that we loved such; After Hours, Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and Goodfellas .. I wouldn't call ""The Departed"" one of his best .. probably his worst.I'm not comparing the moving with any movies .. I even haven't seen ""Infernal Affairs"".It is an exciting thriller .. you will enjoy it but by the ending you will feel that you are lost in the middle of nowhere because of the lacking of the necessary minimum depth and it was just a stupid ending. I highly doubt that the movie will receive any big nominations at the Oscars or any other big film awards.That's what Hollywood dose to a movie! .. it makes it only ""pretty"" pointless picture! Overall, it isn't a bad movie .. it is enjoyable most of the time .. watch it without high expectations and you will save the big disappointment.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
And the Oscar goes to...,"Well, Martin Scorsese finally got his Oscar. Long overdue. Some may quibble and say the film for which he was rewarded was not his best. Those who say that may have a point. But that's really not important. The questions which must be asked are whether this film is worthy of being an Oscar winner and worthy of being forever remembered as the film which broke the infamous Scorsese Oscar curse. The answers to those questions? Resoundingly yes. The Departed stands in its own right as a remarkable film, one of the best to come along in quite some time and clearly worthy of any and all awards it has received. Maybe not Scorsese's best but if not it's pretty darned close.Where to begin? So many different things come together to make The Departed the standout film that it is. There's a great story, a terrific cast full of big-name performers clearly on top of their games, wonderful visuals, a perfect soundtrack...all capped by that unique Scorsese touch. In this film Scorsese goes back to the familiar world of organized crime. This time the mobsters are Irish rather than Italian and the story unfolds in Boston rather than New York but it will all seem rather familiar to the Scorsese devotee. But this is not just another Scorsese mob movie. It's as intense and gritty and violent as you would expect but The Departed is quite unique, thanks mostly to the wonderfully involved and intricate story which unfolds in the film. For everything else the film has going for it in the end, as it usually does, it comes down to the story.The plot really revolves around two figures, Leonardo DiCaprio's Billy Costigan and Matt Damon's Colin Sullivan. The two both come from Boston's rather proud but rather rough Irish community. After very different experiences in their youth, both end up in the same place, becoming Massachusetts state troopers. But soon their paths will diverge again and the story really begins to pick up steam. Sullivan has become a cop for one reason, to provide inside information to Frank Costello, the gangster whose presence is always looming over Boston's Irish neighborhood. Sullivan's a mole. Soon Costigan will be too, assigned to go undercover and infiltrate Costello's gang. Quite a tangled web. Soon both the police and Costello are well aware they each have a rat inside their organization and Costigan and Sullivan will be racing to unmask each other before being discovered themselves. A very high-stakes drama this is as the potential consequences of being discovered are painfully obvious for our respective rats.While the story is thoroughly engrossing, great actors are required to bring that story to life. And one thing The Departed surely has no shortage of is great actors. DiCaprio and Damon are both terrific, each bringing just the right personality to their respective characters who are quite a bit alike but also so different in many important ways. Damon seems more calm and collected, DiCaprio more edgy and intense and those emotions work perfectly for the two characters. Playing Frank Costello is Jack Nicholson who is typically brilliant. Authoritative, menacing, diabolical and always dangerous...that's Frank Costello and who better for such a role than Nicholson? DiCaprio, Damon and Nicholson have the three meatiest roles but there are plenty of opportunities for other actors to shine as well. Mark Wahlberg breathes great life into the character of Sgt. Dignam, one of Costigan's handlers within the police force. Dignam is a man of great conviction and passion and whenever Wahlberg is on the screen you get the sense there is always something fierce simmering just beneath the surface. Well played. There are other big names in the cast like Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin who fall perfectly into their smaller roles. And there are countless less-familiar faces who also do fine work. It seems Martin Scorsese has brought the best out of each and every member of his cast. And in doing so he has been able to wring as much drama as possible out of the terrific story with which he had to work. A great story, performed wonderfully by a terrific cast, all touched by the hand of a master director. Add it all up and you have something truly special, a wonderful film worthy of all the accolades it has received.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Very good - but not very Goodfellas,"The Departed is a slow-burning simmering thriller, a tale steeped in deception, and gently, expertly brought to the boil - until a slightly overcooked finish leaving a slightly unsatisfying taste in the mouth.Martin Scorsese's latest is a very well told story by one of the greatest directors of all time, and while the Departed does show exactly why the great man is so highly thought of, it also hints that perhaps he is not quite at the peak of his powers anymore.The film is good, indeed it is very good, but the Oscars for best picture and director feel more like an apology from the Academy for overlooking Raging Bull, and particularly Goodfellas, rather than just recognition for this film. Yes, nobody does gangster films like Scorsese (unless Coppola wants to continue his Godfather saga), but while many directors would be proud to have 'The Departed' in their filmography, Goodfellas was far superior. The dialogue was sharper, the acting crisper, and the story more flowing.Yet the Departed remains an enjoyable film. Largely the feeling of two parallel intertwining stories feels very effective, with both Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio providing a great deal of conflict in bringing their lead characters to life. Both are all contradictions - Damon is the cop who is a mole for the mob, and is smooth, charming, but yet somehow slightly bland, whilst DiCaprio as the man from the wrong side of the tracks handpicked for a special undercover assignment as a mole within the mob is a violent thug with a turbulent past but desperate to get his job done. With so much deception, you are never sure who knows what, and, rather appropriately, you feel like rats in a maze. And Scorsese does expertly time the reveals of information and keeps you guessing - but yet something about it feels ever so slightly underwhelming. However the action does heat up nicely towards the final third, with an interesting homage to the original by the use of a scene in Chinatown in Boston, creating some genuine edge-of-the-seat moments, until a rather unexpected conclusion that slightly jars against what has gone before.The acting however is uniformly excellent. One thing that can be said for Scorsese is that he sure can get the best out of DiCaprio, who here produces work to rival that of his portrayal of Amsterdam in Gangs of New York - another Scorsese picture. Damon however seems to be slightly lacking in charisma, although that does not provide a tremendous problem here. But it is the supporting actors who really steal the show. Jack Nicholson as the crime lord produces an atypically restrained performance - never overacting, and producing a quietly menacing performance, relying on his natural gravitas to still fill the screen whenever he is on it. Martin Sheen is as ever a class act, but the show-stealers are Mark Wahlberg as the intensely unlikeable but committed handler, and Alec Baldwin, who is given precious little screen time, but certainly makes the most of his scenes without scenery-chewing antics like those seen in Glengarry Glen Ross.Overall, while this is a worthy addition to the Scorsese canon, the unsatisfactory conclusion and some of the slightly unsatisfying reveals make this feel a somewhat inferior cousin to Goodfellas, rather than a true companion. Yet any other director would be proud of this work, and rightly so, as there is a great deal to take pleasure from. Maybe Scorsese just set his own standards too high for anyone, including himself, to live up to.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Intense and Gripping Throughout,"The Departed as many as declared as Martin Scorsese's masterpiece. What's surprising here is that this is not an awards seeking film rather The Departed is purely a thoroughly entertaining mainstream blockbuster designed more to be enjoyed than to be analyzed. The Departed has been praised for several years, especially since it's immediate release. It is a great example of the difference that a visionary director can bring to relatively conventional material.The overall premise is clever, the action is gripping, production values solid all around. What really makes it stand out though, aside from Scorsese's style, is simply how much good fun it is. Laughs come frequently and loudly throughout the film, with almost all being character based rather than cheesy one-liners or goofy sight gags. The result is some tremendously smart and snappy dialogue interplays mixed with scenes which give the actors room to breathe and add their own style.

"More of the same - good, but the same","Don't get me wrong, I am a big Marty Scorcese fan, but I want to point out a few things about his latest film that you may not have noticed because he has become so crafty over the years. These are some of the ""tricks"" or ""Devices"" which were cool in ""Casino"" when first used, but now that it is ten years later, they seem a bit tired and overused.1. The use of Early Rolling Stones music under a scene. Can't you afford to hire a real composer? OK, we get it. Rolling Stones music is cool, but do you have to use it in every movie and have it play under scenes.2. The steady cam shot into a place of business that the mob guy has dominion over: Although the steady cam shot in this film was relatively short, it still reeked of the same type of shot into the Copacabana club in ""Good Fellas""3. The Iris wipe. This, to me was never a good idea and in fact seems like a frustration of the ""limitations"" of film by Scorcese: Basically, the director can't find a way to focus our attention on a particular piece of business in the shot, so he narrows our field of view to exclude everything else except what he wants us to see.4. Lots of graphic violence. Again, OK, we get it. Organized crime kills people and chops them up and puts their heads in vices and beats them with baseball bats: Hey, Scorcese has an excellent special effects team headed by Robert Legato that make those head splatter shots realistic, but really, there is more violence in a Scorcese picture than most Friday the 13th flicks. Can you tell the story with less on screen violence? It seems that Scorcese forgot that the audience has an imagination and that their imagination is more powerful than his special effects and stunt crew.5. The ""chop sound with picture"" edit. Again, a cool and effective device for switching scenes, but again more of a crutch device. Can't you just find a clever way to edit from one scene to the next without chopping the music from the previous scene?6. Stupid women. Aren't you ladies a little angry at how women are portrayed in Scorcese's films? Let's see, Jodie Foster is an under-age hooker in Taxi, Sharon Stone is a drugged-out gold-digger in Casino, and Vera Farmiga plays a Psychiatrist, but is basically pushed around and lied to the whole picture. I am guessing that this is reflecting Scorcese's Heritage's view of women as subservient, second-hand citizens. Imagine how much richer his films could be if he had the ability to portray a strong female character?In summary, I really enjoy Scorcese's directing and his visual style. I am just disappointed that the little Italian man gets stuck in his bag of cinematic tricks. Imagine Hitchcock using a shower scene in several movies or Kubrick using a steady cam shot behind a big wheel more than once and you get the idea I am trying to get at.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Original is WAYYYYY better!,"Having seen both the original Martin's adaptation of the movie, I can't help but feel that the original totally outperformed in terms of writings, screenplay, plot, dialogue, soundtrack and depth of the movie. Both films had a very strong cast. However, the original's cast acting performance was more real and touching. The original made a huge hit because it encompasses more than just a basic organized crime and thriller movie including the philosophies and thinking of the eastern culture and Buddhism. No doubt I would rate it as a great movie had I not seen the original but Martin's adaptation is too far-cry compared to the original. It's completely a waste of time.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"One of the best films this year, despite a couple of flaws.","Acting: Top notch. Everyone involved gives a top caliber performance and, let me just say, it's so good to see Nicholson being the crazy badass we all know and love again. Even though Baldwin doesn't have much screen time, he steals the show with almost all of his lines.Dialogue: I cracked up more than once, and I felt myself barely breathing the rest of the time. It went from darkly humorous to riveting in a flash, and did so brilliantly.Story: I gasped more than once during the ending, if that's any inclination. This movie's long, but it more than held my interest the entire time so I'm not complaining.So why didn't I give The Departed a ten? It was held back from true greatness by shoddy editing (I noticed at least ten inconsistencies, and I'm sure there were more that I missed since I was so entertained) and a very serious flow problem. It jumped from scene to scene so quickly that I found myself confused a decent part of the time, especially in the beginning, and a good portion of scenes were completely useless. For example, there's a one minute long scene of Nicholson's character throwing crack on a bed and telling a hooker to snort it 'till she's numb that comes out of nowhere, and disappears just as quickly. You could say it was to show how screwed up his character was but, trust me, there was plenty of whacked out crap to serve as proof of the villain's madness, so the scene was useless.Despite its flaws, though, it shouldn't be missed. Scorsese does it again with this brutal, dark caper that keeps you guessing up until the end. You'll laugh, you'll jump, and you'll have to pick your jaw up off the floor. There's one scene in particular, centering around a cell phone 'conversation' in which nothing is said and both characters stare at the phone, simply thinking. If the actors weren't as brilliant as they are, it'd be a waste, but their talent lets you practically be able to read their minds. Simply brilliant.If you're a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Martin Scorsese, Martin Sheen, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg or Alec Baldwin, GO SEE THIS MOVIE.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Oh the Scorsese,"You can not go wrong with that man, can you? For me, this movie was one of the best I've ever seen. The suspenseful aura was definitely there.

That feeling of being certain about what happens next and the realisation of your mistake is what makes this movie good. You feel like you can easily predict the next scene and BAM - here comes the wow part. However. There was something unsatisfactory hidden in that movie. At some point I felt lost by the tempo. Is it too fast? Maybe. Is it too fast for me? Surely. I would love it to last longer, to let this movie get every detail, squeeze the juice out of it! Also, there is this thing that bothers me. One moment of the movie was like The Irishman for me which isn't necessarily a bad thing, it's the same director, right? But it felt almost like copy paste kind of thing.

King Martin conquers Boston,"Martin Scorsese hits the mean streets again in his triumphant return to the crime genre that has justified his position as arguably the world's greatest living filmmaker. The Departed, a remake of the well-acclaimed Hong Kong grit-fest Infernal Affairs, follows the complicated lives of Billy Costigan (former criminal turned undercover cop), Colin Sullivan (current criminal who's weeded his way into the police force) and Frank Costello (the seemingly infallible Don who's array of memorable quotes have made The Departed the most naturally quotable film since Mean Girls).This film is always contained in the mind and hands of Scorsese; we never forget that this is his project, and his influence is constantly felt throughout the film. The cinematography employed reminds us of some of the director's earliest projects, and that he certainly hasn't lost his touch. The trademark quick cuts, flashbacks and general detail offered to every aspect of every scene are all on display. The integration of dated yet actual footage of the Boston race riots with the commanding, satisfied voice of Jack Nicholson's Costello creates one of the most engaging opening scenes in recent film history.Frank Costello reminisces about 'years agowhen we had the church' and that, even today, 'no-one gives it to you, you have to take it' all to the tune of Gimme Shelter, a song that has largely defined all Scorcesean works post-Goodfellas.But don't be fooled, this is not the stereotypical Don who can't believe business is no longer conducted the way it was in the old country. Flunking out of the Corleone School of Business, it appears that Frank controls every aspect of his universe with an iron fist and a silver tongue, until his own flaws come to the forefront in a denouement scene that could be seen as uncharacteristically cliché, if it weren't so masterfully acted out in front of us.For all intents, the acting, in its purest form, is the strongest suit of The Departed. Essentially an ensemble film, Dicaprio and Damon exceed expectations while Crazy Jack adopts his most blatantly villainous role since The Shining. Marky Mark is delightfully hateable and the rest of his Funky Bunch (Sheen, Baldwin and Farmiga) make themselves known as well. One of my film-osophies is that one can distinguish a good director from a great one on how they apply a comic-relief character within the plot of their film. Baldwin's portrayal of Ellerby is witty, used sparingly (a crucial quality) and has a genuine respect and passion for his work within the force, giving him a somewhat larger scope for character development than just being the laugh generator in what is otherwise a very serious film.While The Departed goes against the mould of earlier Scorsese dramas (which typically focused on the goings-on around a single crucial protagonist), it does retain the fact that each primary character has very obvious flaws that will be inevitably extracted and exploited as the film progresses. I find this to be not only a treat to watch unravel from a creative perspective, but also the central message of the film: humans, by their very condition, are morally flawed, and that the consequences of their actions upon society have greater reaches than the effect of those consequences on any one person.If there was to be any criticism imposed upon this film, it is that the intended plot controls the characters, rather than the character(s) dictating where the story is going. This might need to be made a little clearer. In films such as Taxi Driver and Raging Bull, the story does not go anywhere unless Travis or Jake respectively choose to steer it in that direction. With The Departed, the characters merely serve as a vehicle for getting parts of the story from A to B, or to connect the plot in a plausible manner, and several scenes towards the conclusion seem somewhat too convenient for a film that has a lot to say about the implications humans have on the world around them.That said, this remains a highly enjoyable film, but one that benefits infinitely from multiple viewings. After eventually deciphering who dies, where they die, and why they died in your first sitting, it is advisable that you re-watch the film. This allows you to delve very deeply into the persona of each major character and gain a subsequent understanding and appreciation of one of the best examples of ensemble cast filmmaking in the history of dramatic cinema.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

Easily one of my favourite films,"Somehow I'd never watched this movie until now, but it definitely didn't disappoint. The whole gangster/mafia genre isn't usually my sort of thing. I was already aware of what the last scene in this movie was, but fortunately it didn't take away from the experience and I was still left shocked by how it all played out.
The Departed easily features on my list of favourite films, and has left me wanting to explore this genre a bit more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Wow!,"The departed is definitely one of the best work of Martin Scorsese. The biggest postive point that makes the movie more interesting is the the way the director had provided proper backstory for almost all characters in the movie. The lead characters have their conflict and they try to solve them, which in turn results again some conflicts. This shows the brilliance in the screenplay. The movie has a run time of about 150 minutes, but still the way we are glued to our seat till the climax portions is clearly depicting that the director had succeeded in his part of giving a edge of a seat crime thriller. Especially, the plot twist at the end makes the movie even more effective. And, the performances of the lead actors are totally praise worthy.

Huge disappointment,"""The Departed"" is being hailed in some circles as Martin Scorsese's return to a genre he knows like the back of his hand -- the gritty crime drama. And to be fair, there are moments of grit in the film. The problem is they are just that -- moments. Nothing ever builds to any tangible feeling of dread. The film's effect (if it has any at all) dissipates the moment the credits roll.The acting is serviceable at best, but the much touted script by William Monahan barely gives the main stars anything to sink their teeth into, with the exception of Mark Wahlberg. He's the only actor who registers anything resembling a real, live human being. Leo DiCaprio and Matt Damon try their best, but when they're not spouting exposition they're floundering with dialogue that tries in vain to give their characters some color. (The session between Leo and shrink Vera Farmiga, for example, drags on to embarrassing length in a dismal effort to give Leo some shading.) And while most reviews praise Nicholson, he's more of a distraction than any kind of menacing character. For all his offbeat touches, his character never come across as dangerous; in fact, the longer the film goes on, the less interesting he is and the more goofy and unbelievable he becomes. (There were times I wondered if anyone could possibly follow him into a life of crime.) As for Scorsese, whatever gritty touch one might think the master would bring to a supposed throwback project is sorely missing. At 2 1/2 hours, the film has a noticeably slack pace, and many scenes are surprisingly flat, considering Marty's way around a camera. The only scene with any real tension is the rooftop scene between Costigan and Queenan. The photography, editing, and acting all combine in a perfect example of film suspense. Nothing else in the film is nearly as exciting.And the less said about the ending the better. It feels like Marty is trying to channel Quentin, but it just gets more and more outrageous until all connection with reality is sapped away. Too bad. I wanted to love ""The Departed"", but I can barely say I liked it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Departed--and not a minute too soon.,"This is a terrible movie.

It isn't; think of the great gangster movies of the thirties, forties and fifties.

The Second Best Scorsese Film of all Time!,"Considering the overwhelmingly positive critical as well as laymen reviews this movie has garnered over the years, it would certainly be an understatement to content that this movie solidified the quality of Scorsese as a promising and exceptionally talented director to such an extent that it earned him his long awaited 'Academy Award for Best Direction'. This movie also turned out to be the only Scorsese film to ever earn an 'Academy Award for Best Picture'. This movie is certainly my second favorite Scorsese film of all time (behind Goodfellas at #1). This is undeniably one of the best movies of the century so far. This movie has it all! From top-notch acting to a complicated and tricky plot involving dilemmas of the protagonist as well as the antagonist and spectacular action sequences to notoriously brutal violence. This movie perfectly encompasses everything that is expected of a Scorsese film. Certainly deserves a 10/10 rating from me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Better than the HK version,"I've seen the HK version, Internal Affair, of this movie long before it became available in movie theater. I think the delivery is much better in The Departed than Internal Affair. I have seen countless of Hong Kong movie, believe me, I was born in Hong Kong.In the HK one, the dialogue were just not there. I think in general, dialogue in HK movie need a lot of works. Second, the role of each player wasn't very clear in the HK version. Remember at the beginning where both of the cadets started from the same Triad group, i.e. the temple sense at the very beginning. So it makes audience wonder who is really the bad guy. Third, in the end, the police guy (the real bad guy) trying the be good after the head detective was killed. I think that confused the heck of the audience there. The role switching near end of the movie is a big no-no and just don't make sense. If I was the mole in the police force, I would have done what Matt Damon did, killed everyone to protect my identity.The American version has a much more powerful delivery of the story. It is very good in showing how Leonardo DiCaprio nearly becoming insane for being a mole in the Mob. The 3-way relationships between Matt/Leonardo/Vera Farmiga is a good tying-everything-together development. The brain splatter scenes simply drive home the fact that its is not a nice job to work with the Mob. It is expected because it is an action movie, period.In all, I like the American version over the HK one is not because the story but its delivery and logical way of laying out the characters. It make you think twice on becoming a mole....",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Double dealing with a vengeance,"The debates will probably rage on for years: Has Scorsese done his best work here?Like many in this forum, I've seen all of his movies. From the aspect of thrills-a-minute, edge of your seat action, I think I'd say this is his best movie. However, as gangster movies go, I still prefer Gangs of New York (2002). For suspense, Scorsese's remake of Cape Fear (1991) beats them all, I think. And, for characterization, Raging Bull (1980)  the movie that should have got him an Oscar  is still without equal, for me. Having said all that, however, The Departed is still the overall winner, mainly because the story is so well constructed and delivers the best double twist  or is it triple?  I've seen for many a year. In fact, I'd be hard pressed to think of a better one...So, I won't be saying too much about the actual plot (the sequence of events), but the story is basically this: two young graduates of the police both act as undercover agents, one as a mole inside the Boston Irish mafia, the other as a mole for the same Irish mafia inside the Boston police force. The story centers around the two moles trying to unmask the other and it's a race to see who gets in first, so to speak. Aaaah, such irony...With a stellar cast of just super actors, this film just had to turn out right: too many careers were on the line, I think. And, it did turn out right. There's not a false note by any of them, with one exception: I wasn't convinced that Madolyn (Vera Farmiga) as the police psychiatrist could be so stupid to become the lover of both moles. I can suspend my disbelief about a lot of things to carry on with a narrative, but that just doesn't ring true. However, it serves a purpose, as you will find out; and that suggests to me that such artificiality was injected for that very reason. But, I could be wrong...Generally, it's fast paced, as I implied, but there are a few slow spots for me, mostly to do with Madolyn with the moles. To keep pace with the action, the editing is quite the best I've seen; the sequence when a body lands, from a great distance, on a city street in front of one of the moles in unbelievably precise, timed to the millisecond, but believably gruesome.Jack Nicholson is just superb as the gangster boss, affable yet entirely menacing; Ray Winston  always my favorite gangster  is an excellent sidekick and trusted friend for the boss; Alec Baldwin again shows his implacable nature as one of the police heads, Ellerby  just as affable as the gangster boss, and almost as menacing when needs be; Martin Sheen, as Queenan, the head of the undercover section, brings perhaps the only honest face into the story; and Mark Wahlberg, an actor I've ignored for a long time, gives a very good impression of a terrier that just won't let go  he's actually terrific in the role of Dignam.As to Di Caprio and Damon, the two young cops: both very accomplished actors and both acquit themselves with very believable portrayals  apart from sharing Madolyn.The only sour note for me was the closing scene, and I mean the very last shot, as the camera pans across the balcony of an empty apartment to show... Well, I'll let you find out. Tsk, tsk  how banal... and how unnecessary.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Fan-frickin-tastic,"Raiders of the Lost Ark is the only movie I'll ever give a 10 to, but this movie is as close as you can get to that. I love this movie. This is one of the most engrossing films I have ever seen. The writing, cinematography, direction, and acting are all awesome. It is an intense movie that kept me on the edge of my seat. And the ending is of this movie is beyond words. Blew me away. Damon is in my favorite role of his next to Jason Bourne. Jack is great. And even Dicaprio, who I am not a fan of, is pretty good.

great if you haven't seen Infernal Affairs,"I was a skeptic. I saw Infernal Affairs for the first time a few months ago and thought it was an excellent movie. One of the best Asian flicks i've seen (and i've seen a lot of them). I thought ""great....another American remake"". There was a small glimmer of hope. It's Scorsese after all. I waited....great rotten tomatoes rating. Great IMDb rating. Was this the comeback of American cinema? I was excited. It was what a wanted. A great story, great actors (well...more on that later), and a great great director who understood the genre.Well...apparently, my guess is everyone that raved about this movie hasn't seen Infernal Affairs. This film, in no way, lives up to the original. I think, if you haven't seen the original, you would probably think this is the greatest film ever. The story is that clever, and Scorsese is that good. Unfortunately, it ALMOST all ways (not all...almost all) the Chinese movie betters this one.You would have thought Scorsese learned after Gangs of New York that Leo does not make a good tough guy. Guess not. I hope Leo plays to his strengths and take roles more similar to Catch Me if You Can or the Aviator.Martin Sheen's character is no where near as prominent as the Chinese flick. and in the end, as great as Matt Damon and Leonardo Dicaprio are, they do not have the ""coolness"" factor that Andy Lau and Tony Leung brought.There were some correction of plot holes that were re-written to make more sense, but in general the plot changes were no good. Some scenes were done different to the original, but some scenes were done shot by shot. Unfortunately, even these copies scenes didn't deliver as powerfully as Infernal Affairs.Infernal Affairs had such a great ""coolness"" factor to it. And the chase/action scenes were executed in a way that built up WAY more suspense than The Departed.All that said, still a decent movie. But seriously.....if you've seen Infernal Affairs, don't expect this to live up to the hype it's been getting. If you haven't seen Infernal Affairs, I'll leave you with two options.1) You are OK with watching non-Hollywood films and don't mind reading subtitles. By all means grab the Infernal Affairs DVD and watch this!2) You hate reading subtitles and dislike non-Hollywood films. Watch The Departed and enjoy it. It is good.....but i fear only because the original story was good.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Another ""Sympathy"" Oscar","I'm never going to be in a position to win an Oscar, so maybe I just don't understand how goshdarn fab it is to get one. Still, were I Martin Scorsese, I can't imagine not being too ashamed to show my face in public after receiving an Oscar for this claptrap. This isn't a Martin Scorsese film; this is a Saturday Night Live sendup of a Martin Scorsese film. This is the Academy saying, ""Well, we didn't give him one for Gangs of New York or for Good Fellas, and he's getting a little long in the tooth, after all. We'd better give him an Oscar for this before he croaks."" Is there anyone -- ANYONE??? -- in this film, with the possible exception of DiCaprio, who isn't acting following a major dose of Xanax? (Matt Damon evidently took his Xanax after a lobotomy that was so botched that he could no longer even change his facial expression.) And what's with Mark Wahlberg's HAIR??? Is there any redeeming social value in scene after scene (after scene) of heads exploding in a red cloud? Even Scorsese is bored with depicting violence; he does it because it's expected of him, not because he really gives a damn anymore. You're stupid enough to want it; he's jaded enough to give it to you. A plot line with more holes in it than the hull of The Titanic. Characters about as appealing as Jeffrey Dahmer. You can't care what happens to a single person in this film, and you can't even care that the moral center collapses about an hour in. This film isn't even sickening; it's just dull, dull-witted, and trashy. Scorsese got his Oscar out of sympathy; too bad the film doesn't have any for the viewer.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Sufficient,"Really impressive entrance scene is welcoming to us. Clearly introducing the character, his effects to the other people and his personal characteristics . The scene contains all of them. Also the perfect acting of the Jack Nicholson highly augments this condition. Absolutely marvellous. The time range which is containing of these scenes (about 10 minutes with the police academy scenes ), is pretty short but this is not causing any error. Afterwards the mini plot twist is improving this beautiful effect.One of the good event in this movie is the process is obvious even though contains the complicated stories. Also the bad end is exraordinary and quite dramatic. I like that
Actings are magnificent, it beggars all description.But after the nice scenes, the part which is when the Di Caprio at the interview is so confusing and just about these times we contiously hear music. The music status progress with the movie this is really annoying to me. If we watch an action movie this doesnt have to mean all of the scenes must contain action and tension music. We watch a dialog scene and in the background constantly hearing a music together with it. The music pull me out from the movie. What am I doing now? Am I listening to music or watching a film?So my general suggestion is fairly good. But I think this is a bit exaggerated.

Truly a master piece. Pwns the original Hongkong one.,"It is no secret that The Departed is a remake of the successful Hongkong movie Infernal Affairs. I watched the original one in 2002, right after it was out. I wasn't so impressed then, plus it has been quite some time, so I barely remember any details. But I still can recall the general idea I got. It has a script with intertwining clues which generates considerable intensity, even if several leading actors' performances are mediocre at the best.I mistakenly extended my old opinion to the Departed, and delayed watching this masterpiece because I thought it could be overrated. As soon as I finished watching it, I realized that I want watch it again, right then. It is a completely new movie, spiritually. The affiliation in the screenplay to the original one is unavoidable, but Martin Scorsese did a great job in substantiating the cop and criminal story with his own interpretation. If the original Hongkong movie delivers the sense of cool and cool (sorry I couldn't find another proper adjective, since all what they tried to do is to be or pretend to be cool; anybody, anytime, anywhere.), The Departed is on the other hand all about crime, homicide and deep unrest. Infernal Affairs attempted to get into various profound philosophical topics such as causality, karma, the nature of human being. In my opinion it overextended itself to gain ground for none. The Departed starts less ambitiously and puts more effort on setting up the backgrounds. The psyches of the main characters become subtler and more authentic. DiCaprio's role rooted in the Irish Section with a family heritage being either bankrupt or criminal. This setting credibly fits into DiCaprio's expertise and explains why he is picked to play the mole. Another bold but effective modification of the original script is to combine the role of the 2 lead actress into one, a change proved smart in that it not only reduces redundancy but also creates an convincing love triangle.Even better is the award-worthy performance of its shiny all-star cast. Matt Damon (as Colin Sullivan) persuasively presented us a deceitful rouge cop, especially considering those dutiful roles (Private Ryan~) he used to act. Jack Nicholson (as Frank Costello) skillfully portraits the aged corrupt boss with a strange paternal charm. Vera Farmiga's Madolyn is gorgeous. Intellect and sensual, she is just the right person for this character. And Leonardo DiCaprio, eventually get enough matured to break the Jack-of-Titanic prince-of-charm stereotype, really outperformed himself in his rendition of Billy Costigan. (BTW Leo also did a great job in Blood Diamond, another highly enjoyable Oscar nominee.) In my opinion Dicaprio is the biggest surprise I got from this movie.Some people have been concerned about the excessive curse and violence in this movie. To me these are necessary materials to faithfully depict the restlessness of those who plays with darkness so intimately.The Departed is a timely reminder to the industry that good movies are made of solid storyline and engrossing acting, not of superficial CGIs or eye-candies. Cheers Martin Scorses, Cheers all men behind this great movie. If The Academy won't give you the deserving awards, surely the audience will hold a place for it in their memories.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Oscar Nominated and Winner? Another Shameful Joke of Hollywood,"Two just-graduated officers from Massachusetts Police Academy follow opposite sides of the law: William Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is assigned to work undercover with the Irish mobster Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) to get evidences to arrest him. His true identity is only known by his superiors Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) and Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen). The protégée of Costello, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), is promoted in the Boston Police Force and is the informer of Costello. Each police officer gives his best effort trying to disclose the identity of the other ""rat"".""The Departed"" is a good movie, with a great cast, but never deserved to be nominated to the Oscar. There are dozens of better movies, and even ""Donnie Brasco"" is better and better. The exaggerated and absurd story and situations have no credibility; some dialogs are simply ridiculous; shows prejudice against the Catholic Church with free aggression; the romance between William and the incompetent psychiatrist is senseless; and the character of Jack Nicholson is full of clichés and awful lines. A guy with such stupid attitudes could never be a powerful boss. Now I understand why Martin Scorsese asked to double check whether his name really was in the envelope of the Oscar. He probably knew that this movie could never be an Oscar winner, and he was afraid that it could be a joke. Actually it was another shameful joke of Hollywood.

Everyone shoots everyone.   ooops I gave away the plot!,"Jack Nicholson does his impersonation of Rip Torn, Dicaprio and Damon are distinguished only because one of them (but which?) has some facial hair, and all of them and everyone else puts on a lousy ""Southie"" Boston accent so even the actors natively from there come across as fake. Except a few actors put on a fine Irish Brogue so you know they're Irish. Such entertainments are needed in this remarkably plot-free orgy of camp, grumbling, meaningless shootouts and poignant cell phone usage. I haven't counted to see if cell phones are used as often as guns, but no doubt a future thesis on the theme is lurking.Jack Nicholson at one point refers to the John Hancock building. That's a building in Boston. Wow, Nicholson was so in character he might have just winged that.Everyone calls everyone else a rat, or an undercover, and sometimes they say things like ""He's undercover!,"" What undercover?"" ""No, he's my undercover."" Abbott and Costello more humorously expressed it: Who's rat's on first?There's also authentic Hollywood crime lingo, like ""were you tailed"" (a play on rats perhaps).Everyone informs on everyone else and in the end, everyone shoots everyone else, except one person who's character is so vague you can look him or her in the eye and not know who. ""I want my identity back,"" says one character, mysteriously. All of this highlights the key themes of the film, that everyone is everyone else, and in the end, only cell phones survive.There's also a lot of looking in cell phones, presumably because to Hollywood types, even more than the rest of us, looking at cell phones is done often and always is a thrill.This movie is a really good argument for having movies directed instead of run by mugging improvisers; alternatively a future film can dispense with actors entirely, and focus entirely on cell phones and computer screens.However the City of Boston, played largely by itself, is convincing.T",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

It ain't no good remake and it ain't no Goodfellas.,"Compared to the original, Infernal Affairs, the Departed is a much weaker film: it lacks a whole lot of style and grace. This not only goes for the directing, but also for the main actors, Leonardo DiCaprio (well, he is at least 'okay' for the very first time) and Matt Damon (who is, as always, eh, Matt Damon). In Infernal Affairs the relationship between the two characters is much more layered en also much more equal: the viewer can feel for both of them. In the case of the Departed there is one hero in a very black and white setting.The greatest disappointment of the movie is perhaps the way Jack Nicholson is allowed to be completely over the top in every scene he's in and do all the tricks we've seen him do over and over again. Why didn't Scorsese tell him to tone it down? All Nicholson has to do to be impressive is walk into a room, he doesn't need all that other stuff (which is proved in About Schmidt). And the thing he does in the porn theater: come on! Since when are wrap-party- jokes put in movies? No, the Departed ain't no Goodfellas.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

I'm not going to come out and say Infernal Affairs is a better movie. When you add up all the elements of both films, The Departed is the superior piece of film-making. What disappointed me though, was that Scorcese really didn't take it to the dizzying heights I would've expected after such a positive reaction from almost everyone that had seen it.Probably every aspect is improved upon in terms of the production process, with the exception of editing. I thought some of the earlier scenes about their childhoods were unnecessary and failed to add anything really substantial to the structure of the original... and that's perhaps my complaint for the whole movie. By the end I felt like I'd just watched Infernal Affairs all over again. What was good, didn't really change. What was bad was changed, but not in such a way that it made any dramatic impact.The romance subplot for instance, was equally as dull as it had been in the original. There wasn't much chemistry between the psychiatrist and the two leads.. it was done well enough to make a point about the two of them, but not well enough to really move me.The acting was fine, believable, occasionally there'd be something that'd make me draw breath from Jack Nicholas and Leonardo DiCaprio. But most of the time, nothing more.I guess what I'm trying to say is this: had I never seen Infernal Affairs, The Departed would have been nothing short of spectacular. But I had. And what I got was a very competent remake from the master that didn't take the story or characters to any dramatic new depths. What ultimately kept my attention wasn't anything different that Scorcese did, but the same, tense game of cat and mouse that was lifted straight of the original.Honestly I wanted to sing this movie praises, but all I can really do is clap and say: 'well done'.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A film filled with unnecessary and nihilistic violence and  profanity,"Do you know the story about the king who left his palace naked and everyone in the crowd watching him were commenting on his splendid clothes? This is how I feel after reading reviews from well-known and ""respected"" critics on Scorcese's ""The departed"". Because that is what Scorcese's film is-it is naked, devoid of any rhyme or reason, of any reason why things happen, of any values. To me it is just the ranting of an older man, it is Scorcese fantasizing about violence, sex, corruption ; it is Scorsese thinking ""wow it is so clever to show all this blood and to have my actors swear all the time, yeah this is art"" . Well, I am sorry, but this isn't art. This is about Scorsese repeating himself and indulging in his obsessions and us congratulating him. I am not a conservative person- I just feel like the little boy in the story who cried out that the king was naked; like the little boy who wasn't a hypocrite and just showed things as they were.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Brilliant Film,"If i was to define this masterpiece in one sentence it would be: Martin Scorsese's crowning achievement. This film is absolutely stunning, this movie is a rare case of a movie remake that surpasses its original in most ways. The acting is stunning, performances from high profile actors such as Leonardo DiCaprio,Matt Damon and the legendary actor Jack Nicholson are just a part of what makes this film a must see. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is his best, and perhaps Jack Nicholson's best film since the shining or even one flew over the cuckoos nest. If Martin Scorsese is the Beatles of mob movies The departed is his Sgt. Pepper. Although an amazing film, the departed can be difficult to follow and at one point is victim to choppy editing. The movie is complete with a fantastic score including the rolling stones classic ""Gimmie shelter"", the Beach Boys, the allman brothers band. All in all, one of the greatest movies of all time.

Exciting and unpredictable,"What I liked most about this movie was that after watching it, there are still a lot of topics to think about even though the movie itself leaves no loose ends. Everything is beautifully shot and the plot is - in my opinion - damn near perfect. The characters in this movie are all so well rounded and the acting is amazing. It's almost a cat-and-mouse thriller, but also so much more.DiCaprio as an undercover cop and Damon as a crooked cop both are entangled in their life choices. Their actions bring up many questions about what separates good from bad and how ambition or pride can be your downfall. Just about each of the main characters have their own journey and are interesting enough to keep you submersed in this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Serious men,"IMDb Top 250: 58The Departed is like Goodfellas for the next decade. It has crime, music, and Scorcese at the reigns. While it cannot replicate the magic of Goodfellas, which will never happen, The Departed tells a different kind of crime story with great success.If you didn't know, The Departed is about the Irish mafia in Boston shown from both sides of the law. The tale is quickly paced, with lots of angry looking men. There's several twists and unexpected moments that will affect you in various ways. Gritty and violent, The Departed gets in your face.The film centers on men who are on both sides of the law, or so it appears. DiCaprio is excellent as Bill, a rookie cop in a family with a history of crime, who is sent undercover. His anger is very well conveyed. Leo does a great job. He is backed by Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Dignam (Mark Wahlberg). Sheen may be the only reasonable person in the entire film, and he's a good foil for the vulgar Digham, played well by Wahlberg, who acted from experience. They're all going after Costello, in another superb performance, this one by Jack Nicholson. He's a little crazy, and a great villain. His informant in the police is Sullivan, played by a mostly straight Matt Damon. He does the role justice, but doesn't stand out.This is very evidently a Scorcese picture. Great shots, including a cool intro with Costello where his face is just out of the light until the reveal. The pace is fast, and the film is well edited. Music accompanies, but ends abruptly, or is nearly silenced. It doesn't work as well as Goodfellas or Casino. For some reason, Gimme Shelter is played- twice, as is the most- fitting Shipping Up to Boston.Crime fans and fans of Scorcese need to see this, and those who can stomach the brutal violence and copious amounts of swearing should see why this won Best Picture. Serious men indeed. 8.6/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

It's a drama that will get you to laugh sometimes, fast paced too and far from just an amusing movie but one that you will have to keep pace with to fully comprehend the plot.Di Caprio's part was really important to me because it was the one I tried to identify with, espesially after he gets released and he's roaming the town. Almost every character is interesting though, with Colin, Costello and Dignam on top of the list.Acting was great too, Wahlberg is aware that he is not one of the best but I like him and in this film he proves his self.

Still Stands Up Among Today's Modern Films,"This was an absolute masterpiece. It forgoes today's flashy action, predictable deus-ex-machina plots, modern CGI, and picture-perfect good-guy-gets all endings for genuine suspense, gritty crime, and the great human elements of playing dirty and playing double. LeoD and Matt Damon are incredible in this film, bringing intention and rawness to an incredible script.Definitely more than a simple story of cops and robbers.This story digs deeper into the mind of man, and arguably juxtaposes two definitions of what it means to belong, what it means to make something of oneself, and challenges the typical image of loyalty to tribe. As much as we might despise our antagonist in this film, an insightful viewer will respect his commitment to his definition of family and loyalty throughout most of the story.This isn't a before-bedtime film.

First off,"First off, this is an American stylized remake of the Hong Kong hit, Infernal Affairs. I have to give credit to that, a good film. I have seen both Infernal Affairs and The Departed. I personally prefer The Departed, and I think because of one thing: Martin Scorsese. This is the master behind such greats as Taxi Diver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, and he's at it again. The film has an all star cast with Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, and Alec Baldwin.The Direction was amazing. (maybe one of the reasons why he won the Oscar for it) I loved how some of the scenes were shot and set up. Especially regarding the Chinatown, and police interrogation scenes, among many others. The film is perfectly set up with intense, suspense scenes while adding in amounts humor at times. It works really well. The script is top notch. (Also Oscar winning) Realistic strong dialogue from scene to scene.Another thing I liked more in The Departed, as opposed to Infernal Affairs, was the acting. DiCaprio really seemed to earn a lot of respect from this role. Here, he takes on the tough guy persona so well. Sure it was known he was a good actor from his Oscar nominated performances in What's Eating Gilbert Grape and The Aviator, but he really takes it to another level here. I can't see anyone else as the character, he fits so perfectly with it. Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg, being Massachusetts natives, also give solid performances, with their natural accents. Nicholson works well in his role, as well. Everyone was extremely solid and everything seemed so real.Set in Boston, The Departed takes in all the Boston like atmosphere. Beautifully shot scenes of the Massachusetts Golden Dome State Capital building is just one part of the landscape. The Dropkick Murphys song ""I'm Shipping up to Boston"" really fits, great use of songs. Scorsese usually works music into his films really well.""Cops or Criminals. When you're facing a loaded gun what's the difference?"" This quote really represents the film."" Matt Damon plays a state officer in the Police, working for the crime boss of the area, Frank Costello (Nicholson). While Damon's character can be described as a ""bad guy,"" he is really misunderstood. As a kid, he is sort of mentored into crime business by Costello while Costello becomes the father figure Damon's character never had. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a young guy, coming from a bad, crime ridden family. He's decides to become a police officer to get away from the crime life he's been surrounded by. Taking all this into account, Captain Queenen (Sheen) and Seargent Dignam (Wahlberg) decide to send DiCaprio's character undercover to find out more about the criminal underworld and Costello. With his family's crime record, he fit's perfectly into the situation. Now you have a highly ranked officer working for bad guy, and an undercover cop in the criminal underworld working for the State Police. From here it's an all out suspenseful thrill ride. Who's who? Who's working for who? Who can you trust? Paranoia threatens everyone. Lies. Betrayal. Sacrifice. How far will you take it?At the heart of this film is character development. We really feel for the characters. We feel like we know them. It's really amazing part of this story and film. Tremendous story telling here.This is one of the most entertaining and suspenseful crime/drama's I have seen in a while. While Infernal Affairs, came first, I think The Departed expands on it in so many ways. Really solid crime/drama. Check both out when you get a chance. It's really worth it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Without Nicholson, Departed Would Have Been Better","The Departed is pretty good, but not because its large cast is good or because of Martin Scorcese's direction.Its good because the original Chinese film its copied from, Infernal Affairs (2004) was probably a superior script. I'm rushing to get a copy from Netflix as we speak.The story is about two impersonators who have infiltrated the Boston Police Department. One is employed by the Police Department to find any moles who might have penetrated the force. The other works for Boston Mobster Frank Costello, not related at all to the Mafioso who rapped his knuckles on a congressional desk in the fifties during a televised hearing about organized crime.Jack Nicholson plays Costello and wrecks the movie pretty much. In interviews this weekend, Nicholson said he wasn't inclined to be in the film because the Costello role was little more than a cameo. But Scorcese had the part built up for Nicholson, hurting the film in the process.The film is a tightly wound tale of intrigue about moles inside the Boston department. Leo De Caprio and Matt Damon play the spies. De Caprio is better than Damon but not by much. De Caprio knots up his forehead too often in order to be taken seriously as a slightly troubled cop.There's a certain amount of advanced technology to sleuth the mystery the audience already knows the answer to. But this is a great script.Jack Nicholson's Costello is over the top, damaging a pretty good film substantially. De Caprio is off his mark too.But this is the best Scorcese film in years, better than Gangs of New York or the Aviator, both of which were directed by Scorcese and both of which featured Leonardo De Caprio.Nicholson is so awful and such a gargoyle, he reminds me of Burl Ives, who was terrible as Big Daddy in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof in 1958. Nicholson is almost always miscast and overacting these days. I think the last decent film he did was the Postman Always Rings Twice in roughly 1980. He hasn't been good in anything since, but they keep paying him as if he's a bankable star.Other actors in what is supposed to be an ensemble film include Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Alex Baldwin, Vera Farmiga and Krista Dalton. Dalton is a newcomer and is quite good. But Baldwin, Farmiga and Wahlberg don't get enough time to act with Nicholson chewing scenery all the time.The film, due to its extraordinary plot and a series of film surprises, is quite good, despite everything.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The Departed: A Must-Watch Masterpiece,"One of the most delightful surprises in this was definitely Mark Wahlberg's performance. I was expecting a terrible performance when I heard he was in this movie, however, what Wahlberg delivered was pretty amazing actually. His intensity, sharp wit, and commanding presence stole every scene he was in, and he was sharing the screen with Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio of all people.And then there's the dynamic duo themselves, Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio. Damon's suave yet tormented portrayal and DiCaprio's raw, emotionally charged acting was actually really good. Together, they created some of the greatest on-screen chemistry I have ever seen.Jack Nicholson was just incredible. His performance was off the charts. As Frank Costello, he was both scary and charming at the same time. Every expression, every line he delivered was spot-on, making his character one of the most memorable things about this movie.I really want for more collaborations between Scorsese, Damon, and DiCaprio after watching this movie.

The Rat Pack,"I've been after the 2007 Oscar's badge for a while now and have had a couple of aborted attempts to rewatch ""The Departed"". It's arrival on Netflix though gave me the impetus to sit down and watch it. Though I know it's rather thought of as Scorsese's ""honorary"" best picture Oscar winner, there's an awful lot to admire in this remake of the Japanese organised crime thriller.Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) runs organised crime in the Irish controlled areas of Boston. Taking a smart young boy under his wing, he convinces Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) to join the police force and be his man on the inside. An organised crime department within the force takes young recruit Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), who has dubious characters in his family, and convinces him to worm his way into Costello's crew. With both moles in place, the pressure on the pair rises and the risk of exposure becomes all consuming.If Scorsese tends to prefer to make character study type movies, ""The Departed"" is a bit of an anomaly - not because it's lacking in performance, Nicholson excels as the truly awful crime boss Costello and is matched in memorable turns by Mark Wahlberg's foul mouthed cop - but because the film is driven by it story. The duality of the two 'rats' both perhaps the only two people who could understand each other but driven to acts of violence by fear of exposure. Admittedly, Scorsese has made the odd organised crime film before, though the shift from an Italian accent to an Irish one provides the smallest big of variety. Speaking of accents, it's another misfire from Ray Winstone, not quite ""Black Widow"" bad but certainly moreWhat's unarguable is the quality of the rest of the film, the cinematography, score as well as the depth of the ensemble cast. It doesn't, for me, get close to a true Scorsese classic, like ""Goodfellas"" but it's certainly a worthy enough film in its own right.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Unbelievable film,"The Departed was one of the best movies I've seen in awhile. The characters, including the minor roles, were spectacular an humorous. The story itself was well done and for a movie over two hours long, it sure wasn't boring.Martin Scorsese is one of the premiere directors of his generation. He helped make Robert DeNiro one of the greatest movie actors ever, and with the Departed he shows that he still has what it takes to make a clever movie. With movies like Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and Mean Streets to his credit, The Departed fits rather well in that great selection of movies.The plot is not real complex. Jack Nicholson plays Frank Costello, the leader of the Irish Mafia in Boston. The police department is trying to find hard evidence on him so they can finally arrest him. They use a spy of their own named Billy Costigan(Lenardo DeCaprio) to try and get the information they need too finally catch the man. However unknown to the police department, Costello has his own mole planted in the FBI. His name is Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), and he always lets Costello know what's going down before the police can ever catch him. This cat and mouse game is played throughout the entire movie and has the audience wondering how both characters, Costigan, and Sullivan, are going to manage this all without being caught themselves.This all leads to a violent conclusion which had everybody in shock. Some people were disappointed and some were just plain surprised. I was one of those that was surprised by what went down because it happens so quickly that the audience of the film has no time to react. The final scene on the other hand is somewhat predictable and that alone is probably the only weakness of this film.Overall this film is probably one of the best I've seen all year. All the characters were great, even the minor ones. Mark Wahlberg in particular has a hilarious role, and I mean that in a good way. Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin were also very good as was Vera Farmiga who plays a clinic psychologist for the police department. Very well made movie and worth the ticket price.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Scorsese  got his Oscar out of sentiment, not for this embarrassment","Very, very, very disappointing given the all-star cast. I love much of Nicholson's work, but in this he's not very believable as a crime boss. Nicholson can certainly do the man in charge, but not in this. Leonardo is fairly believable, although he seems to be working hard on looking sullen. Damon is okay, nothing special. Sheen is fairly good but Wahlberg is awful. Sheen has to pretend there's not a bad smell in the room when he's with Wahlberg. We are to believe that his Dignan is expressing real emotion, this is a real tough guy? This story relies on so many twists to carry itself, but the weakness of the characters and to some degree, the plot, is surprising.

Exceptionally well made misery,"I absolutely, unequivocally loved this movie when I was a teenager. And how could you not? It's incredibly well-made, well-crafted, and so well-written you have to wonder if William Monahan didn't make a deal with the screenwriting devil that he's been paying for ever since.But after watching it recently, for the first time in more than a decade, my biggest takeaway was how depressed it made me. This is a miserable movie about miserable people making miserable decisions that ultimately serve to make them even more miserable (even more so than other Scorsese classics).And don't get me wrong -- I don't believe the job of every movie is to make you feel nice, safe, and happy all the time. I was just surprised at how a movie I'd been thrilled by in the past was now leaving me completely deflated.So I guess in a sense this is less of a review and more of a reflection on how our perception of movies changes as we do. When I was younger, I was entranced by the style, craft, suspense, and unpredictability, but now, after having been through the wringer a few times myself, I empathize so much more with the characters and everything they go through. All the elements I loved about the movie before are still there, and I still appreciate them, but the content, itself, hit me differently than it ever had before.All this to say: if I sit down to watch ""The Departed"" again in another decade, I'm gonna have a stiff drink or two ready to go.Special shout out to Thelma Schoonmaker's editing, in this and all of Scorsese's films, now and forever, amen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Both fortunately and unfortunately, it's what we've come to expect from Scorsese","Martin Scorsese was once one of the world's great filmmakers, but the truth is that he has been rehashing some combination of ""Raging Bull"" and ""Mean Streets"" for the last quarter-century. Even his latter-day masterpiece, ""Goodfellas"" repeats the revisionist gangster themes of ""Mean Streets"" with the visual language of ""Raging Bull"" almost exactly copied. In this way it's unfortunate that ""The Departed"" is more of the same.However, even in his darkest hours of imagination, Scorsese has always been a competent storyteller whose films are filled with excellent, vibrant performances, spot-on editing and of course his much-revered knack for choosing score material. In this way, it's fortunate that ""The Departed"" is more of the same.The story is one that inherently involves all of Scorsese's favorite themes: violence, identity, and loyalty. It tells two essentially identical inverted story lines: (Slight spoiler, but no more than the commercials told you) A young man who has grown up learning from gang leader Frank Costello becomes Costello's mole inside the state police and a young man who has grown up surrounded by criminals becomes an undercover police officer who infiltrates Costello's organization (spoiler over). The intertwined stories are perhaps the most interesting part of the film, since this take on narrative is something new to Scorsese's repertoire, but it unfortunately is not handled perfectly. Some of the editing is coarse for no obvious reason and yet Scorsese does not provide us with any visual cues that either show that we are supposed to be confused or help us orient ourselves.Meanwhile, the acting is perfect all the way. Mark Wahlberg may be a one-note actor, but his character is his note. Meanwhile, Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio are excellent in deep, layered roles, though Damon does not have the opportunity DiCaprio does to chew up the screen now and again. Martin Sheen is used perfectly in the type of role we're getting used to him playing. Most importantly, the borderline-campy theatricality and evil of Jack Nicholson is used to absolutely perfect effect in devilishly comic portrayal of an underworld kingpin.Oddly, one place where the film goes awry is in its use of music. While certainly the Rolling Stones' ""Gimme Shelter"" is used wonderfully, to great effect and absolutely appropriately (almost as well as the instrumental section of Derek and the Dominoes' ""Layla"" in Goodfellas), some of the music was annoyingly distracting. This problem also crept up on Scorsese's last film, ""The Aviator,"" at a few points, which is a disturbing and disheartening trend in the director's career. It almost sounds as if he is trying to insert more ""hip"" music with which he is less familiar (and which he may even like less) and thus is forcing it into place far more than when he uses some of the classic rock anthems and classical standards he has used to such great effect in the past and even in this film. The presence of composer Howard Shore obviously doesn't help, either, as the master of the Very Standard Score delivers the same thing he nearly always does--a bag of clichés.Overall, the film is worth sitting through once, and probably worth more than that if you're unfamiliar with Scorsese's work.

Boston PD Culture in an Unforgettable Crime Mystery,"Although I'm several years late watching The Departed, I was impressed by how real the film holds up, despite time travel. Brutal language, violence, Boston accents, and culture, and the evil conflicts between the Boston and Providence RI mob gangs, creates an unforgettable Scorsese film. Particularly interesting is the birds eye view of the Massachusetts Police Academy, with anecdotes of how people inside law enforcement live seemingly ordinary lives while dealing with the worst evil crime syndicates in the US. DiCaprio is absolutely at his best playing the conflicted undercover PD agent Billy Costigan, who tries to win the confidence of his mob boss (Jack Nicholson) while keeping his undercover identity secret. At cross purposes is Matt Damon, who is doing the complete opposite, as PD officer Colin Sullivan, who tries to keep the confidence of his precinct boss Captain Queenan played by Martin Sheehan. In fact, Sullivan is double crossing his public trust by keeping the mob led by Jack Nicholson's character Frank Costello, in the business of murder and extortion. The Departed is an adult film, period. Nonetheless, performances by the main cast are extraordinary - note Alec Baldwin who holds the viewers attention as a PD facilitator and instructor for the plot to uncover the undercover agents. There isn't another actor I know of who could execute this minor but bridge building role other than Baldwin. Nicholson's evil intentions carry this film's graphic plot, because his performance as a crime boss is totally convincing. Otherwise, Vera Farmiga is a somewhat ambiguous character who is not exactly likable, but she brings the cruel pieces together in the end, so to speak. I would give The Departed a rating of 10, except I did not like the counseling scenes with DiCaprio and Farmiga - they were not realistic. Yet, I believe, The Departed will stand the test of time as one of Scorsese's best films and a great cultural description of America's syndicated crime culture.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Watch the original before this one,"I don't understand how can it have such great marks when the original version is way better. It's pretty much the same as the original except for one particular thing that was one of the best parts of the original film.And the thing that really pisses me off is that it was given the Oscar for the best adaptation... it was adapted from another film (tell me how difficult it can be) and the good parts are all the same.It may be true that the actors did it very well and that the plot is excellent, but the original actors are as good as these ones and the original plot is even better so I highly recommend to watch the original one first (Infernal Affairs).

Another great from Scorcese,"A great movie I thought that picked up pace more towards the end of the film. The acting particularly from Dicaprio was great, in particular the scene where he meets the shrink and the moments he tries convincing Costello that he is not a mole. Jack Nicholson played his character fairly convincingly. Despite not having the same menacing demeanour that Pauli's character portrayed in Goodfellas, Costello did look very much like the 'should be retired' rough and mean looking gangster in his own laid back way. I should have guessed Mark Wahlberg's character was still out there at large. He had a big mouth in the film and played the annoying and to some extent a crooked cop well. I totally did not see the ending coming, the twists in the end did not match my guesses but were a welcome shock in the end. Another great film from Scorcese, although Goodfellas still keeps this one in the shadows.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Entertaining Gangster Movie,"If you like Scorsese you will definitely enjoy this movie. For those like me who are less convinced of his genius, it is still an entertaining gangster movie. Many critics voted this as the best movie made in 2006. The film is well-made but I have always failed to understand his Scorsese's films are so loved by critics. I know cops and I've worked with the Russian mob and the characters in Scorsese's movies have always seemed phony to me.Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) and William Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) are Boston police officers. Costigan agrees to go undercover to catch local crime boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Costello runs a protection racket and sells drugs. Some of Costigan's family members have a background in crime, so he is accepted into the gang. Sullivan has known Costello since childhood and becomes his mole in the police department. Costello's tips allow Sullivan achieve accelerated promotion and become the superstar of the police department. Damon and DiCaprio spend most of the film trying to unmask each other. They also become involved with the same woman (Vera Farmiga), a therapist.In Scorsese's world everyone men are macho sociopaths. There is plenty of high decibel screaming and swearing. His characters don't mind killing and torturing and violence is just another form of communication. Women are either whores or mothers or like Vera Farmiga's character they act like both. The cops and villains seem interchangeable. In fact half the thugs seem to be working for some government agency. Police Captain Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen) seems to be the only normal guy in the movie. The police behavior is occasionally so extreme that the movie loses credibility. Sullivan's boss, Alec Baldwin, beats up a police technician because he makes a mistake. Sergeant Digham (Mark Wahlberg)abuses everyone and gets into fisticuffs with both Damon and DiCaprio who are supposed to be on his side.Sullivan seems to be in it for the money, but none of his colleagues questions how a police officer in his twenties can afford to live in a large expensive apartment in the Beacon Hill area of Boston. It's not clear why DiCaprio, with a 1400 SAT score, would agree to go undercover and mix with psychos for an indefinite period. The movie has a cast of superstars, but Damon and DiCaprio both seem a little too familiar and congenial to be believable tough guys. Nicholson looked as if he had wandered in from a romantic comedy. He seemed too old and lacked the menace the part demanded. DiCaprio gives a one note performance as a grim, angry man. That said, if you like crime dramas you will be entertained. There is plenty of action and the actors ham it up to attract your attention.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

DiCaprio does a good job and Damon is surprisingly good, but the story is just so blah and predictable that it is easy to fall asleep while watching the movie. in my opinion,the movie does not focus enough on one character to facilitate viewer involvement. also,the music is not prominent enough and some of it is recycled from other Scorcese films which makes a veteran movie goer such as myself think Scorcese should ride off into the sunset.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Great movie,"The Departed was a fascinating movie chronicling the Massachusetts State Police Department's battle with a Boston mob led by Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a young, aspiring police officer with family ties to the mob. Seeing this as an opportunity, the police department sends him undercover to infiltrate the mob and become close to Costello. At the same time, Costello sends one of his own men, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) to become a police officer and infiltrate the department to stay one step ahead. This turns into a high stakes race between the two men to find out the identity of the other.There seems to be a strong theme of morality in the film, as it has a classic good cop-bad cop storyline. What is fascinating is how both Costigan and Sullivan have to pretend to be exact opposites of who they are as they play their undercover roles. On multiple occasions, Costigan admits that the stress and anxiety of living a double life is causing him problems psychologically, knowing he is one screw up away from being killed. Sullivan is also dealing with his own issues of leading a double life, which begins affecting his relationship with his girlfriend.Two aspects that I thought really enhanced the overall vibe of the film were lighting and music. As most of the story centered on the mob and illegal activity, many of the scenes were shot with a low contrast. In particular, there were several bar scenes toward the beginning of the film where Costigan got into some fights with members of other mobs as a way to impress Costello. Another crucial scene where an illegal deal took place between Costello's crew and a rival gang also exhibited this lighting style. The low contrast element did a great job of setting the tone for the illegal activities as well as making the audience feel like they are a part of that world. The music choices also set the tone very well for some big scenes in the movie. The best example of that is the song 'Shipping Up to Boston' by Dropkick Murphys, which is used several times throughout the film, including the climatic chase scene at the end. The song naturally has a Boston vibe and fits great with the mob culture that is portrayed. All in all, The Departed was a riveting film, and one that does a great job portraying mob culture as well as the humanity and morality involved in pretending to be somebody you are not. If you are a fan of other Martin Scorsese films, such as 'Gangs of New York,' then you will absolutely love this film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Something's missing,"I think being a fan of the original movie ""Infernal Affairs"" ruined this one for me. The original is almost perfect that I feel there's something lacking for this one. DiCaprio and Damon doesn't seem to quite fit the characters they're playing. The suspense and nervousness I felt every time I watched the original movie, I do not feel it here. There's a lack of sympathy or empathy for the good guys. I've watched Scorsese's films before and I loved them. But this one was not up to par in my opinion. I was actually excited to see what he's going to do with the adaptation of one of my favorite movies but it feel like he made a tamed down version of it. It's like, he has a check list and made sure all the important parts of the original is in the new adaptation. But those who will watch it for the first time may think this is a great movie because it has a strong plot and storyline and Scorsese did a great job adapting this from a HK environment to a Boston environment.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Dreadful,"Here we go again. Another chapter in Scorsese's love affair with slimeballs. Whether it be Italian or Irish he has an unreasonable fascination for the genre.The central baddie is played by Jack Nicholson who does nothing but play Jack Nicholson. He chews every piece of scenery with a reprise of the malevolence he exhibited in ""The Shining"". You would think that a director with the skills of Scorsese could control him. But, perhaps he didn't want to do so. In any event, his performance is operatic and intolerable.Damon and De Caprio do well, as do Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg, but not well enough to make sense or meaning of an atrocious script.Scorsese showed us that he can be skilled in material other than sewer trash, with ""The Age Of Innocence"". Please Martin, give this garbage a rest.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Identity,"This is kind of the ideal remake. It takes a concept with great potential that the original didn't fully realize, deepens it, does more with it, and transplants it to a completely different setting. This isn't just Infernal Affairs in America, this is Infernal Affairs in Boston. The script by William Monahan, a Boston native, ends up so intimately tied to the reality of the city, its different cultures, locations, and even history that it gives the movie such a wonderfully distinctive flavor that sets it apart from the original. Add in Scorsese's incredible skill behind the camera, his ability to coax great performances from all of his actors, and the editing prowess of his long time editor Thelma Schoonmaker, and you've got one of the most entertaining mob movies of the past twenty years.This film follows the original plot point for plot point, and yet they feel like entirely different movies. They're made differently with vastly different focuses that provide incredibly different experiences. Those who value plot over every other element of narrative would probably gravitate towards Infernal Affairs more naturally, while I see The Departed as a much more well-rounded experience that provides wonderful characters to enjoy. It's the story of two young men, one a police recruit and the other a protégé of the local mob boss, going undercover in the oppositional organization. There's Billy Costigan who goes from the police academy to the mob, and then there's Colin Sullivan, who follows the local mob boss, Frank Costello, around as a very young man who enters the police academy as his mole. The two moles end up on each other's tails, just behind as they try to figure out who the other is.Where this movie really differs from its predecessor is ability to really let its characters breathe. That starts with Leonardo DiCaprio's Billly Costigan. A young man of two worlds from the start (his mother lived on the north side of town while he adopted a Southie accent when he went to visit his father), he's pulled from the police academy and given an undercover job to infiltrate the mob organization of Frank Costello, played by Jack Nicholson. DiCaprio gives one of his best performances as Costigan, especially deeper in the film when he begins to feel cornered, desperate for a way out. The other side is Matt Damon as Colin Sullivan. Overconfident, probably to mask some inner turmoil (potentially some homosexuality), he's a star trooper, helped along by Frank who offers up ironclad proof for crimes against unconnected people that Sullivan can present to his bosses and wrap some bows on cases. Sullivan is the much more improved version of Lau. His inner turmoil combined with the actual relationship with Frank he has that steadily frays as Frank gets more and more commanding and paranoid is a fully believable train of thought and action that sells the final act completely.Both Costigan and Sullivan are at war with themselves. They both want to be good and loyal, but to whom should they be loyal? Should Costigan be loyal to Captain Queenan and Staff Sergeant Dignam who leave him exposed to danger for years? Should he be loyal to Costello who takes him under his wing and ends up trusting him more than anyone else in his organization? Should Sullivan feel support to Costello who treats him terribly, threatens him constantly, and could potentially be an informant to the FBI (like Whitey Bulger, an inspiration for the character)? Should he feel loyalty to Captain Ellerby who promotes him and gives him greater authority? It's really interesting how often the two characters' journeys mirror each other, and it never feels heavy handed, like when Costigan has to get his broken arm recast while Sullivan is on the fancy date with Madolyn, the pretty psychologist.Madolyn represents one of the major improvements from Infernal Affairs. None of the female characters in the original Hong Kong production could have been really called characters. They were thin placeholders for dialogue and little else. Madolyn gets into relationships with both Costigan and Sullivan, and she ends up being a driver for both characters. She meets Sullivan first, falls for his easy charm, moves into his nice apartment overlooking the state capitol, and gets engaged. They seem happy, but he's at war with himself and he can't open up to her, outright telling her that he can't tell her things. Costigan, on the other hand, is a patient that she sees a single time in a meeting so mean spirited but honest that she can't see herself helping him on a professional manner, but he manages to ask her to coffee immediately afterwards. There comes an honesty between the two that gives Costigan his one safe outlet in a dangerous world. She becomes his guiding light in the fog. Played with intelligence and poise by Vera Farmiga, Madolyn is a very good addition to the story.Matthew Modine, in this video from the Criterion Collection, said that in theater actors create performances, but in film it is directors who create performances based on their choices of takes. Jack Nicholson's Frank Costello is quite a creation that fits this theory pretty well, I think. From the stories I've read of this film's production, Scorsese gave Nicholson a very wide berth to create Costello. The scene where Costello confronts Costigan on whether he's a rat or not was filmed with a few props just out of view that Nicholson could pull from if he was feeling like it. The take that Scorsese left in was where he grabbed the gun and pointed it at Costigan. What I'm saying is that Scorsese has learned how to both allow his actors to go off in any direction they want but to piece together a cohesive performance through the chaos. It helps that Nicholson is playing a man who's steadily feeling cornered and out of control, a psychopath struggling to keep control of his environment, but that could be a recipe for getting lost, like what Scorsese oversaw in New York, New York.The film's resolution as the moles work their ways out of their holes, Costello comes to his end, and Madolyn discovers the true natures of the two men in her life, is a surprisingly affecting ending. There's a lot going on across a fair number of characters, but while ensemble pieces are hard they are far from impossible to pull off. Everyone's dealing with similar issues, centered around the idea of duality. Even smaller events have this implication like when Costello confronts the older priests about how they abuse young boys, the men of the cloth being corrupted. Costigan finally facing off with Costello's mole is the ultimate bringing together of all the parts, though, and the suddenness of the turns in this scene fit the story, fill out details, and it never feels cheap.The Departed is the work of a screenwriter providing concrete settings and intelligent character work to an existing plot while an incredibly talented director builds performances that fill out the characters and pulls all of the other disparate elements into a complete package. It really is a great film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Brilliant,"Everything was perfect about this film except for the girl. I can't decide if it was poor casting, horrible acting or she just wasn't ready for this caliber film. Although her presence wasn't irritating enough for me not to enjoy this movie, it really made me question the professional opinion of who looked at her and thought... ""yes, she's perfect."" DiCaprio, Wahlberg, Damon, Nicholson & Baldwin gave masterful performances...even the supporting cast (with the exception of the girl) gave applause-worthy performance. Visually stunning. I expected nothing less from Scorscese. This film is the epitome of what film-making should be and it was long overdue from Hollywood. A film that makes you recall that film-making is an art-form. Although there were parts that made me cringe, I could respect their necessity and move on because I was thoroughly engaged in the rest of the film. I recommend that every true fan of films, film student, and respecter of fine art go see this movie and if you know Scorscese you know its not for the faint of heart think more Casino/Goodfellas/Raging Bull/Gangs of New York rather than Aviator or anything else he's done.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Departed (2006) - A Gritty and Thought-Provoking Crime Epic,"A story of trust and betrayals involving every genre of people there is. No one can be trusted. From the protectors of law, who does the bidding for those who break it, to the thugs who secretly protects it. Scorsese direction is nothing short of brilliant using the medium, weaving together visuals, character development, and themes to make the movie engaging and impossible to forget the realistic dialogue, electrifying acting, and vivid setting of Boston to make the pace frantic which leaves us as viewers mesmerized. Potentially the most striking and captivating aspects of the movie is the concept of identity and the nature of duality in people's personalities. Thus the theme of loyalty, betrayal, and the realism of lying is complicated by the fact that both Costigan and Sullivan cannot come to terms with their true personalities as they don the personas assigned to them by their respective organisations.Dude, what a fun movie it was. After watching many Martin Scorsese's films, this is his third-best film for me (the first being Goodfellas). Everything was perfect, from the starting frame to the ending ones, and it hooked me damn well. Also, it took me some time to understand things after that boom very intriguing some of the scene was really shocking and thrilling, especially the third arc, bro, unexpected things happens, although being a remake, it has surpassed the original one that has a fast-paced screenplay. That movie was also very good, but here martin takes time like all things go into depth, just like cooking good food takes a lot of time.

Slick and entertaining but no masterpiece,"""Infernal Affairs"" was a fun to watch but totally implausible thriller. It's no surprise that Martin Scorsese's remake is the same. The running time passes smoothly and it never jars in the way that so many Scorsese films do. After you've watched it though the questions start to pile up. The story is basically totally unbelievable and would work much better with a camper approach - John Woo achieved this with ""Face/Off"", a much more entertaining film, mostly due to inspired casting of Travolta and Cage, two actors who can make the best of ridiculousness. Here instead we get DiCaprio seemingly taking it all very seriously and Matt Damon being as dull as he is as Jason Bourne. On the plus side Scorsese remains a technical wizard, a wizardry though seemingly divorced from any insight or guiding intelligence, to the point that he seems to fail to notice the pulp nature of the material here.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Martin Scorcese's The Departed is a modern gangster drama masterpiece,"No director has boasted a stricter understanding of the gangster genre than Martin Scorcese, at least not yet. His filmography dating back to 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino' greatly prove this. We have seen a devilishly gritty portrayal of Henry Hill in the former movie, we have seen the portrayal of a crime family caught in the hazardous world of illegal gambling in the latter. If there is any director who's shown competition against Scorcese in breathing grit into the image of mobster families, it is Francis Ford Coppola with his uncompromising cinematic classic 'The Godfather'. This violent, gritty crime- thriller sees Scorcese continues his trademark cinematic ambition with showcasing an authentic take on the life of mobsters in the complicated world of crime. What many filmgoers may not to know is that this modern gangster piece happens to be a remake of a Chinese film 'Internal Affairs', following roughly the same plot and story structure. Set in the crime-ridden city of Southern Boston, Leonardo Dicaprio plays Billy Costigan, a brash undercover cop and former convict of the Boston Police Department, who is assigned by Captain Queenan (played by Martin Sheen) and Staff Sergeant Digman (played by Mark Wahlberg) to infiltrate an Irish mob gang run by Frank Costello (played by Jack Nicholson). With FBI informant Colin Sullivan (played by Matt Damon) set as Costello's mole and trusts of long-time friends and business partners put to the test, Costigan gets involved in a deadly game of cat-and-mouse as the two fight to uncover each other's identities.In the world of modern day mobsters, things gets complex in a brutally ugly way. And director Martin Scorcese more than just demonstrates here. Keeping the high stakes high and the story engaging, Scorcese places a nasty twist on the mobster genre with this crime-drama where almost none of the characters are who they say they are or make out to be. Then the question that lies throughout the entirety of the plot is who are the good guys and the who are the corrupt ones. The question which lies among the characters escalates into a tautly-paced race against two of the main characters Billy Costigan and Colin Sullivan racing to discover each other's identities. With gunfights erupting in the streets of Boston and the lives of close allies threatened by corrupt individuals handled by the antagonist and crime boss Frank Costello, the film proceeds with an appropriately dark atmosphere. Scorcese does a magnificent job on propelling each scene with near-constant tension and substance, and persistently maintains absorbing character development to keep things engaging without losing track of momentum. Leonardo Dicaprio's Billy and Matt Damon's Colin along with the roaring tyranny of Jack Nicholson's Frank Costello are driving forces of the plot as one of an undercover cop fighting for the truth, and the other is a backstabbing mobster who disguises an law enforcement to put the other in the pawn of their dubious plan. As the body count rises and the identities of the aforementioned characters are exposes, everything builds to a startling climax that seals the deal. Like many of Scorcese's pictures, there is plenty of bloodshed and hard-hitting violence to paint the ugly, but true portrait of the crime underworld.Leonardo Dicaprio, who last collaborated with Martin Scorcese as Amsterdam in 'Gangs of New York', suits up in the center figure of the film here and propels himself with plenty of fortitude and intensity in the role. Dicaprio has proved he is capable of playing roles of both the right and wrong side of the moral compass. His powerhouse portrayal proves is talented at channeling with both anger and striking humanity. Matt Damon, often known for playing the hero role or perhaps an ordinary human protagonist, is given a whole another ball game here. Shifting from his good guy persona to a corrupt individual with a perplexing agenda, Damon gives a genuinely versatile performance that marks easily one of the highest points of his career. Mark Wahlberg plays the trusted supporting figure of Dicaprio's protagonist and certainly makes a big name of himself here. His performance is strong and shines of emotional depth. But perhaps none of these actors are able to compete with Jack Nicholson who boasts a gritty portrayal of the ruthless mob boss Frank Costello. Although Nicholson is no stranger to playing character with violent tendencies, especially after playing the psychopath Jack Torrance in 'The Shining'; Nicholson propels with a sinister appeal to the role that makes this long-time actor stand out among the rest. His character, greatly inspired by real-life Boston gangster James ""Whitey"" Bulger, is about as darkly charismatic as many gang bosses in cinematic entries -- nothing more, nothing less.The Departed is a thrillingly enthralling modern-day gangster drama powered by Martin Scorcese's superb direction and powerhouse performances by a brutally talented cast. This Scorcese piece is an astounding cinematic effort that not only transcends the gangster genre, but marks a powerfully stunning masterpiece that is more than likely to stand the test of time in many years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The Departed,"Yeah so everyone who knows anything about movies has heard the fuss being made over the new Martin Scorsese movie The Departed starring Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Matt Damon. Many critics are saying it is Scorsese's best directed movie since the 1990's classic Goodfellas, and it deserves to sweep the Oscars this year. I have had the pleasure of seeing it twice during its opening weekend and I strongly agree with the above praise.The Departed is an American re-telling of a Hong Kong movie Infernal Affairs and it has a very complex plot but here is a general summary from IMDb. ""In South Boston, the state police force is waging war on Irish-American organized crime. Young undercover cop Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio giving some of his best work to date) is assigned to infiltrate the mob syndicate run by gangland chief Frank Costello (the legendary Jack Nicholson). While Billy quickly gains Costello's confidence, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon, also at his finest) a hardened young criminal who has infiltrated the police department as an informer for the syndicate, is rising to a position of power in the Special Investigation Unit. Each man becomes deeply consumed by his double life, gathering information about the plans and counter-plans of the operations he has penetrated. But when it becomes clear to both the mob and the police that there's a mole in their midst, Billy and Colin are suddenly in danger of being caught and exposed to the enemy-and each must race to uncover the identity of the other man in time to save himself. But is either willing to turn on the friends and comrades they've made during their long stints undercover?"" Like I said above it is a very complex story, which is fitting because the two moles in each organization lead very complex lives. It is a thematically rich yet wildly entertaining movie about honor, duty, loyalty, and identity. It is not just an action/crime flick. The movie breezes by at a pace that feels like much less then its 2 hour and 30 minute running time. Leonardo DiCaprio delivers the best acting performance in the film and once again proves he is one of the finest actors of his generation. The terrific acting from the entire cast (also including Martin Sheen, Mark Whalberg, and Alec Baldwin), sharp screenplay written by William Monahan, and Martin Scorsese's brilliant direction make The Departed a masterpiece.Scorsese is one of the very best American directors of all time. With this film he is exploring the gritty mobster territory that got him recognized over 30 years ago with his breakout hit Mean Streets (1973), yet at the same time telling a fresh and interesting story to make The Departed unique from his other work (unlike 1995's Casino which is basically just a Goodfellas ripoff). I really think he will finally get a long overdue Oscar for best directing, an award he should have received multiple times in the past. The Departed will continue to be discussed in film circles for the next few months until Oscar night comes around, here is hoping it will dominate the ceremonies. It is one of the best films of the current decade as well as one of Scorsese's best films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Great acting, good direction, very flawed storyline.","My main objection to the movie was the vast amount of flaws in the storyline, e.g., Damon was selected to this elite team and no one questioned how he could afford the apartment when he was raised by an elderly grandmother with no money...Dicaprio comes into the police when he knows that the only person there who can identify him as an undercover cop is gone, how stupid is that...Wahlberg quits and leaves Dicaprio without anybody to help him and shouldn't Wahlberg be at least a little suspicious that his boss was killed because he was being followed by Damon's crew, don't quit because you keep your friends close and your enemies even closer...why did Damon warn Nicholson about the second tail when he sent the message where the exchange was to take place...why did Dicaprio stay around when Sheen got killed, he was not the type to go into shock and he knew he was being chased by the killer crew...why did Sheen not protect himself against the killer crew...and finally the shrink she was allowed to live even tho she knew that Damon was guilty. There are others.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Great Addition to an Amazing Filmography,"Any film student or film aficionado can tell you the man behind such iconic movies as Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, and Raging Bull: Martin Scorsese. Scorsese may often work with the same actors and direct stories around criminal life, but there is not a specific distinct style when it comes to his films as you would find with directors such as Tim Burton, John Carpenter, or Christopher Nolan. I mean, how can you compare Hugo to Casino stylistically? What IS behind a lot of Scorsese's films is great storytelling, and The Departed is no different. Though Scorsese deserved an Oscar long before 2007, The Departed lives among some of his greatest work.While it may not be a very diverse ensemble, the cast in this film is simply phenomenal. It consists of iconic white male actors both old and young pulling off their roles as cops and gang members perfectly, and Vera Farmiga doing a ""good enough"" job as a therapist for young cops and undercover workers. While Mark Wahlberg earned himself a deserving nomination for best supporting actor, the actor who steals the show is Leonardo DiCaprio, who probably would have also received a nomination if he had not worked on Blood Diamond the same exact year. We don't know whether to be terrified of Costello (Jack Nicholson) or if we should nervously giggle at his dark sense of humor, Alec Baldwin is at his A-game as an excitable investigator, Matt Damon is Boston personified, and Martin Sheen reminds us why he shouldn't be associated with Charlie Sheen in this day and age. Phenomenal work all around, and one last note is as odd as this may sound, Mark Wahlberg excels at swearing in this film. Funny s***.Based on the foreign script ""Infernal Affairs"" (which this critic is eager to watch) The Departed is unsubtle in its focus on ""rats,"" double agents both in the Irish mafia of Boston as well as the state police force. Matt Damon is a man who was practically raised by Frank Costello to become a rat within the state police while Leonardo DiCaprio plays a young man who grew up in a notorious family who wants to turn his life around by becoming a true cop. Nobody would believe him in a uniform, so Sheen and Wahlberg ask him to gain Costello's trust and he becomes a rat within Costello's gang.Morality is what is at stake in The Departed. The morality of lying is the most notable since the film is focused on double agents, but even the love triangle developed between Damon, DiCaprio, and Farmiga brings this into question. DiCaprio tries to get under Farmiga's skin at first asking if she lies in general, and as she gets closer to him she confesses that she would lie if her boyfriend (Damon) saw her together with DiCaprio. As we realize that Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio are not the only ""rats"" in the story, it brings not only the morality of lying into question, but also it calls for the audience to ask how we can determine who is on which side of the law. Is there a line? Is the law black and white? Or are there exceptions when it comes to double agents?While the narrative is amazing, it is important to note that this film is littered with swearing and violence, so keep that in mind if you're sensitive to these issues or if you are considering letting a child view this movie. Regarding these same issues, do NOT watch this film on cable TV as it is censored to the point where the dialogue becomes ridiculous and you cannot take the film seriously. Other than that, this film should one day become a required screening in college level film courses; a true masterpiece.4.0/4.0",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I couldn't believe this film won best picture...,"I am not a real film buff, and neither is my wife. I had heard that this film was supposed to be good, and rented it. Despite the excellent cast and good production values, I couldn't believe how labored the script was, and how much overacting was taking place (much of it by Nicholson).When we finished watching the movie, I remarked to my wife that I must have gotten the film confused with some other. I went to IMDb to see what rating it had gotten -- I figured maybe a 6.7 or something.To my disbelief, it lands in the top 100, and won the best picture Oscar! I went back to tell my wife that it had won the best picture, and she thought I was joking. Then her reaction was that someone had hacked my computer.As far as the comments here, I would have had to think that there was a large astroturf component. But with the film winning best picture, I guess I am just seeing one of those occasional mass delusions that happens in the world.But what I *really* can't believe is that it won best script. Un. Be. Lievable. This script was so bad, and so unconvincing, that after I told my wife that it had won best picture and director, I remarked that for sure it couldn't have won best scriptwriting. But it did.I simply don't understand what people see in this film. The plot is sophomoric. The involvement of Costello in routine pickups and deliveries, and the immediate trust and access to the boss given Costigan, is so implausible that I find it difficult to believe anyone can take this film seriously.

Finally...the Scorcese I like,"What can I say about this movie? Well for starters I haven't watched anything that stands less than a mile from this movie for quite some time. Scorcese is back with a vengeance and for all those people who loved Casino and Goodfellas, I have three words for you: watch it NOW!! Scorcese somewhat deviated slightly from the habitual Italian mafia movie style in the sense that the film is based on the Irish organised crime in Boston. Having said that, mafia is always mafia and if you're turned on by ruthless killings, major drug deals and gangster etiquette, this is the right film for you.The story line is very gripping and the ending gives credit to its master mind. I expected something more when it came to the dialogues between characters, however that's just me wishing that De Niro was part of the crew...everything else is just perfect.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the best movie endings I have ever seen,"Usually I watch a movie, and I expect what will happen in the end about 15-20 minutes before it happens, or at least I have some ideas how it's going to end. This movie left me shocked because I didn't even think that the movie will end that way.In general, it's a great movie, the start wasn't so clear to the me at least, but it got clear fast and the movie makes interest in the watcher till the end, you never get bored!The acting was good the whole movie, great actors.one think that I think that could be better - Madolyn could've been used to a better link between the 2 main characters, I think the build up of her character and her bonding to the main characters was good, but they good do a better job with it towards the end.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Good but Overrated,"I just revisited the movie for the first time in about six years. I feel like when it came out ( I saw it in the theater), there was so much anticipation for it that everyone seemed to love it. It was probably the best movie of that year, but it is not on the level of Scorcese's best works. However, it is good and watchable compared to most movies. This is due to Scorcese's masterful directing. He can turn a relatively simplistic story into a compelling drama with attention to gritty details.I don't think this should be ranked where it is at about 42 on Top 250. I could see it in the 140-180 range maybe. It's a fun movie, but some of it feels bloated, and some of the acting is mediocre.Speaking of acting, DiCaprio, Nicholson, and Sheen all do great. Farmiga is good enough too as the psychiatrist. But the others- Damon and Wahlberg and some other supporting roles by the gangsters, are a little off. Fortunately, Scorcese has enough script and story to work with here to hide and cover up these weaknesses, especially when it first came out. It's a fast moving script that equally distributes screen time for the most part for most of the actors, so the weaker acting is overlooked on a first watch or two.While I can totally agree with some of the 7 rating or less reviews, I still can't rate this under an 8, but that's solely because of Scorcese's directing of a good script. I also agree that elements of the ""climax"" scene at the end were a letdown. It comes on so quickly and not only did I not like that Colin takes out Costello, but I also didn't find it very believable in a way. I would have had Colin arrest Costello (by that time Colin had no idea that Costello was maybe going to give him and the other mole up to the bureau), as I didn't buy that Colin could be that ruthless, to basically his dad who made him everything he was. It was a violent and disappointing turn of events. But I get it- it sets up the epilogue twists to take Costello out I guess. Also, Damon may very well be and arguably is the worst of the five main actors in the movie.I feel like The Departed is the most pop-culture movie that Scorcese has made, and that's part of the reason he finally won his first Oscar for it, as it appealed to everyone and didn't have much competition in 2006.It's a very flawed, very good movie, but not great. It's not as great as Goodfellas and probably not as good as Casino. But it was fun to see Scorcese make another good gangster movie with a flamboyant cast of actors.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Almost good,"This could be a good film if it weren't for a few loose ends in the development of the story and a couple of strange coincidences made up to maintain the plot in line with the general structure of the script.

Then the good technical quality of the movie and the excellent acting of the other performers. One word too for the good form of all the violent scenes which are truly made and convincing. In conclusion, a movie that can have you agreeably occupied for about 3 hours without adding any special event to the history of cinema.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Give the man an Oscar already!,"The Departed is another knock-out blow from director Martin Scorsese. A gritty, fast paced and highly impressive cops versus robbers fable that is reminiscent of his old classics and makes for a riveting cinema experience. With the awards ceremony season in full swing and the Oscars just around the corner, it'd be a real shame if he didn't walk away with at least one golden statue having been denied them so long, as it is a very impressive movie. At turns, it is both tense, violent, funny, dark and packed with so many terrific performances it is hard to pick a standout and should hopefully be remembered as one of the best films of 2006.Returning to gangland sees Scorsese tackling the underworld from a slightly different perspective. Set in the world of the Irish mafia, it differs from his Italian-American gangster pictures by showing us contrasting elements on both sides of the law in the shape of Leonardo Di Caprio's police mole within the gang and Matt Damon's gang mole within the police. As the police force led by Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg and Alec Baldwin struggle to take down Jack Nicholson's kingpin, the two moles become aware of each other's existence and are soon caught in a deadly game of cat and mouse.All of which might sound familiar and to no surprise, for as has been widely publicised, The Departed is a Western riff on the classic Hong Kong series Infernal Affairs that told the same story. It might be a little unoriginal, but with a pro like Scorsese at the helm, it avoids the inevitable disaster that awaits most Hollywood remakes (stand up The Ring, The Wickerman, The Fog, The Omen blah blah blah) by the twin virtues of having its own identity and a terrific cast. For where the Hong Kong original was a slick thriller, this one is covered in dirt.The Boston underworld here comes across as a bleak and unwelcoming landscape with little of the criminal romance of Goodfellas to be found. The gangs do not lounge in jazz clubs or casinos here but dingy, whiskey soaked bars and quayside warehouses filled with rats. Urban decay is all too evident and when the violence comes, it hits you like a jackhammer. The gun shots sound incredibly loud and forceful and when they strike human flesh, heads are blown apart with stark realism and zero fanfare. Fist fights as well remain taut and ugly, Di Caprio breaking his own wrist in a brawl through punching too hard as his foe is rammed through a glass window. Violence here has pervaded even everyday life and when Jack Nicholson emerges from the back of a bar drenched in blood with no explanation, it is treated as just one of those things that needs no questions.As previously mentioned as well, the cast is on fire. Di Caprio has banished all memory of the floppy haired teenage heart throb and emerged as an unquestionable successor to De Niro's place as Scorsese's on screen muse. Faced with a life or death situation, he throbs with nervous, aggressive energy and his eyes have never seemed more dangerous, yet he is supposed to be the good guy. Jack let go Rose, Jack let go. Matt Damon meanwhile proves himself once again, his role as Detective Sullivan overflowing with moral dilemmas as the polar opposites of his situation come into conflict.They are not the only ones to be celebrated though as Jack Nicholson puts in one of the finest appearances of his long and glittering career. As mafia kingpin Frank Costello, he moves from one dirty situation to another, delivering racist barbs to Chinese gang members and having people murdered with a wicked grin etched on his face, displacing his venom with a malicious sense of humour. Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin deliver fine performances as reliable old hands but perhaps it is Mark Wahlberg who comes out strongest. His Captain Dignam is one of the most hard-assed police officers you're ever likely to see and he encapsulates him perfectly, as well as getting some of the film's best lines. With this and Four Brothers it could be argued he is trying to cap the market for overly macho, angry young men but it must be said, he is one of the most memorable things in the movie.However, if one thing stands in the way of this film and the Oscars it is the undeniable remake syndrome. For all its strong points, it is still a retelling of an existing story and the lack of total originality might be to Scorsese's disadvantage. Nonetheless, it puts paid once and for all to the argument that remakes are a waste of time and is a very worthy version of the Hong Kong original.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Disappointing Remake,"Being Chinese, I have already seen the original Hong Kong version (a trilogy in fact). Honestly, I am very disappointed by Scorsese's remake. Matt Damon's character does not seem to struggle in his double identity. The ending of ""The Departed"" surprises me in a negative way. It is really lame and dull compared to the original.However, it is not fair to evaluate ""The Departed"" by constantly comparing with the original ""Infernal Affairs"" trilogy. I hereby turn my focus to ""The Departed"" as a movie of its own. This is my first time watching a Scorsese movie. He achieves a marvellous job in terms of directing the actions although they are excessive. DiCaprio and Damon are very good in acting but the best actor has to be Jack Nicholson. Playing Frank Costello, Nicholson's facial expression and acting demonstrate the charisma of a gangster leader. Scorsese does an excellent job on generating the tensions between characters too. I did not want to leave my seat for the most part of the movie.Damon used to be an altar boy at the church that Damon can see from his home's window. He has then become Nicholson's mole in the Special Investigative Unit of Boston police. It reminds me about Damon's past. But if Damon has some struggles, Scorsese ought to do a better job illustrating them. I experience Damon's character to be naturally evil in ""The Departed."" ""The Departed"" probably has a different focus from ""Infernal Affairs."" ""The Departed"" comes across to me as an emphasis on the ones that depart after doing good works for the society. ""Infernal Affairs"" emphasizes the tension between people's goodness and wickedness.If this is the case, the ending of ""The Departed"" makes very little sense. I give it a 5 out of 10 mainly because of the poor ending. In addition, the actions (well-choreographed) and foul languages are too much. They become too unnatural as the movie progresses. If you enjoy pure actions, ""The Departed"" is worth watching. But I recommend the original trilogy even more. ""Infernal Affairs"" is miles better than ""The Departed.""",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Rat,"I was kind of disappointed of the last shot of the film--the rat by the window. But who am I to critique Scorsese? It's just that I wasn't expecting such an obvious subtext from Scorsese. The material was superb to start with. The transitions from scene to scene was dry, which I loved the most about the film. All in all, I'd say it's a great film... great great great!The film's cast scintillated each character. I could not think of any other actor playing Leonardo's role. Di Caprio is indeed the most underrated actor in Hollywood today. Yes, he's dubbed as a great actor, but no recognition was given to him yet. The Acedemy has overlooked his talent for quite too long now. Too bad for him.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Beautifully directed, acted, written and edited","Martin Scorsese has had many collaborations with Leonardo DiCaprio. The Wolf of Wall Street is my favourite of them but The Departed comes at a close second.The Departed follows Billy Costigan who is an undercover cop working to infiltrate Frank Costello's gang whilst Colin Sullivan is a mole in the police force working for Costello as he pretends to infiltrate Costello's gang.Scorsese is known for his mob flicks and The Departed is an example of one of his best works. What makes this film work so well is the direction, acting, writing, soundtrack and editing. The performances are all fantastic and it's sad that only one got nominated for an Oscar. This is one of Leonardo DiCaprio's best performances. His acting is a major reason as to why the audience cares about his character. It's amazing how he switches emotions when he's with the police and when he's in Costello's gang in order to avoid suspicion. He does it so naturally and should've got a nomination at least. Matt Damon is also fantastic here as usual and suits his role extremely well. Jack Nicholson is mesmerising in every scene he's in, truly embodying the character of Frank Costello. He's fierce, funny and has a huge presence when he's on screen. Mark Wahlberg gives probably the best performance of his career. Despite his short role, he completely steals the show in every scene he's in as the foul-mouthed, abusive cop. He's absolutely hilarious, a joy to watch and deserves his Oscar nomination. Martin Sheen is also terrific and Alec Baldwin is also great and hilarious during some scenes.The film is very long but Thelma Schoonmaker's incredible editing and Scorsese's impeccable direction keep it from being a bore. There is a sense of tension as we see this cat and mouse game unfold especially with DiCaprio's character as to whether or not he will get caught. The film gets more tense as it goes on leading to an epic finale that completely shocked me as it happened. The song choices are also wonderful and fit very well with the film's location and tone which is expected from a Scorsese film. A massive contribution to The Departed's greatness is William Monahan's smart and witty script. The dialogues are sharp, funny and the actors make them sound so natural. Some of the lines are absolutely hysterical, especially the ones given to Wahlberg, Baldwin and Nicholson, which provides great levity to the suspense and serious tone.The Departed is yet another fantastic Martin Scorsese film. It's great to see him finally get his overdue Oscar because he deserved it a long time ago. I would definitely recommend seeing The Departed.

The Godfather for this generation,"This movie was hazy to me at first. I had questions like which side was Matt Damon on? Was Jack Nicholson going to find the rat?

And just to see Jack Nicholson doing what he does best, it reminded me of Marlon Brando in The Godfather. This was definitely Scorsese's best film since Goodfellas. I truly think that it was the right choice for Best Picture. This movie made me have a whole lot more respect for Leonardo Di Caprio and Alec Baldwin, who I think did the best in this movie. It was a truly spectacular film, with a great cast to go along with it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Thrilling Ride,"In The Departed, Martin Scorsese makes his return to the mob underworld, and he does it with a thrilling intensity that overshadows his previous films. From the start, to the closing credits, The Departed is an incredibly exciting film, and there is rarely a slow moment. Unlike GoodFellas and Casino, the characters were written in a way that makes the viewer relate to them in a very personal way. Their trials and struggles make them very human, and I found myself very emotionally involved, hoping for the best for the major characters. Speaking of characters, give credit to the acting cast for filling the roles emotionally and intensely. DiCaprio and Damon were excellent in the lead roles, but Baldwin and Wahlberg were an absolute joy to watch as supporting characters. While the writing was intense, I sometimes felt that the plot had no central point, and it seemed to go on and on without resolve. It is sure to keep the audience guessing, but at times this was frustrating and I wanted to know more that wasn't being given to me. The finale, while intense to say the least, didn't fill all the holes created throughout the film, and is sure to leave many questions with viewers. I would go as far to say the acting is some of the best I've seen though, and if you're a classic Scorsese fan, this is definitely a movie well worth your time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

One-third as good as Donnie Brasco,"I guess film critics and movie buffs are going to give four stars to any old Scorcese-directed gangster movie, huh? Even ones that don't deserve four stars, like ""The Departed.""I must admit that it's not a bad film, by any means. The performances are mostly solid, the Boston setting is unique and interesting, and there are some genuinely suspenseful scenes. But, on the other hand, there are also plenty of scenes that feel either completely unbelievable, or totally flat, or a noxious combination of both.The plot, which gets needlessly convoluted at times, involves a mob ""mole"" in the police department and his counterpart, a police ""rat"" in the mafia. Apparently, it's based on a Chinese film called ""Internal Affairs,"" but I've never seen that movie so I can't make any valid comparisons.Personally, I couldn't stop thinking about ""Donnie Brasco,"" the similar Johnny Depp/Al Pacino movie about a rat in the mafia. That film contained genuine emotion, complex character relationships, realism... all qualities that are pretty much absent from ""The Departed,"" which feels like an unrealistic Hollywood production all the way. The only apparent advantage that ""The Departed"" boasts is that it has a trendier director than ""Donnie Brasco."" But I think Scorcese pretty much drops the ball in this case and doesn't deserve to be automatically credited as a genius - just how cutesy and self-indulgent is the last shot of ""The Departed,"" anyway?Some people complain about Jack Nicholson's performance, but it didn't really bother me. His scenery-chewing is a nice change of pace from watching DiCaprio and Damon act all earnest and depressed all the time. (Incidentally, I also thought Mark Wahlberg's foul-mouthed cop was very funny and entertaining.) The real weak link in the acting chain is Vera Farminga as the love interest. She's supposedly a psychiatrist, but she gets so emotional and confrontational with her patients that she completely fails to come across as a professional. She's also a bit insipid and doesn't really have chemistry with DiCaprio or Damon.My other major gripe with the film is that the editing is often choppy and strange. Scorcese doesn't linger long enough in most of the scenes - he simply dives into the middle of the action, and jumps out again as quickly as possible. This MTV-style editing doesn't really enable me to get immersed in a movie. And some of his choppy little scenes are downright bizarre and don't seem to fit in the movie (like the weird one where Nicholson goes to the opera.)I suppose that modern films are so bad that critics freak out when a remotely competent movie like ""The Departed"" shows up in theaters. It's a welcome relief from movies about CGI animals and superheroes, sure. But is it really a masterpiece? A top 100 movie on IMDb? Hardly.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Say Cheese!!!---Rat Traps.,"Director Martin Scorsese gets back to the seamy mean streets of metropolitan America after a decade-long hiatus that took place after ""Casino"" was released in 1995 with this fiery and mean-spirited masterpiece that focuses on double agents attempting to infiltrate the inner-most sectors of those very groups they want to take down. Matt Damon is the bad guy in deep with the Massachusetts State Police and Leonardo DiCaprio is our hero who may drown in an abyss of crime and wrongdoings with sadistic Irish Mafia crime boss Jack Nicholson. We have law enforcement officials galore (Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg and Martin Sheen), evil henchmen (led by Ray Winstone) and even a female element (in psychiatrist Vera Farmiga, who gets torn between Damon and DiCaprio herself) in the tangled and winding mixture. William Monahan's script rises above most all other film noir-styled classics of the genre mainly due to the overwhelming star-power (led by Nicholson in arguably his best role since ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"") and of course Scorsese's out of this world talents as a legendary American film-maker. Fast-moving, tense and devastatingly brilliant in most every way, ""The Departed"" is easily one of Scorsese's finest efforts and quite possibly the best film of 2006.

Best American movie in a long time,"Martin Scorsese was already a great America artist but what he has done here transcends mere movie-making and restores my faith in the ability of people today to make a masterpiece. Every week I go to the theater hoping to see a film that will blow me away, and it was getting to the point where I was really thinking that will never happen again. Thank you Mr. Scorsese for a truly great American film. Everything is almost perfect, great story telling, great acting, and great musical score. It's very telling when a crime drama, lased with violence and corruption, still manages to have more humor then most of the comedies produced today. The characters are so well developed and intense, that every scene, every piece of dialogue is mesmerizing. All set to some of the best backdrops ever seen on film. Oh, and one last thing, anyone who thinks that Jack's portrayal is over the top, doesn't have a clue.

Scorsese Gets Back to Basics,"Critics and fans alike are hailing ""The Departed"" as a return to form for director Martin Scorsese, and though I don't exactly know what a return to form is for a director who's made such a list of diverse films, I understand the sentiment.""The Departed"" is not as good as ""Taxi Driver"" or ""Raging Bull,"" but it is as good, and maybe even better, than ""GoodFellas."" Like ""Fellas,"" it's fast, brutal and wildly entertaining. But also like ""Fellas,"" it comes off as fairly glib and lacking in the greater psychological or social meaning that made ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Raging Bull"" such great films.It's nearly intolerably exciting at times; I came out of the theatre actually sweating. Scorsese gets terrific work out of his male ensemble (and lone female, Vera Farmiga), especially Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, who play moles on either side of the cops and robbers divide and end up hunting each other. Scorsese's point, that the line between those that break the law and those that enforce it is hopelessly blurred, is obvious and easy. But the film is so well acted and so technically accomplished that you feel that you're in the presence of greatness, even if the story itself is standard-issue pot boiler stuff.The ending is somewhat of a let down. It feels like the screenwriter got lazy, and instead of resolving matters in a creative fashion, decides that the best way to tie up loose ends is to kill off virtually the entire cast, with one blow-your-brains-out shot after another. But the overly tidy ending does not diminish the impact of this propulsive, addictively watchable and disturbing film.Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
My favourite film,"'I don't want to be a product of my environment, I want my environment to be a product of me.' The film starts with this dialogue. A question is also popped at the very beginning- ""When you face a loaded gun what's the difference,if you're a cop or a criminal?""At the very outset the mood which is started, is kept till the end.Billy ( Leonardo) is from south Boston, has a family with criminal background, which makes him a suitable undercover in his criminal neighborhood. He is a mole in Costello's( Jack Nicholson)outfit. While, Colin Sullivan(Matt Damon)is a Sergeant in Massachusetts, is actually a mole working for Costello. Throughout the movie Billy & Collin try to figure out each others identity.As referred to as Rock star of the gangsters Costello by Alan Baldwin, truly in this movie Jack Nicholson outshines everyone. His character is so insensitive in this film. Everybody has done justice to their characters. Again , Leonardo proved why he is Martin scorsese's pick. Mark whalberg's character of insulting everyone was very unique, also with Mark's Massachusetts accent, adorned the character.Matt Damon was also very good. One more thing I want to say about this film is about its dialogues. I don't remember hearing so many crispy dialogue exchange, after Pulp Fiction. This movie is very intense throughout, with some twists and turns, that keeps you at the edge of the seat. This movie touches everything like, racial discrimination which was there once in Boston. And, bravely puts forth its opinions.I have seen this movie more than 50 times. But, whenever I see it, it never bores me. This movie teaches you a lot of harsh realities of life. Martin scorsese dished out so many good flicks. But, according to me this has to be his best film. He gave it all. Deservedly, it won an Oscar This is one of the best crime thrillers of all time. I would recommend everyone to watch this great flick.Hats off and all my clothes off to Martin scorsese for giving this incredible film. I'd like to finish this review off with a quote in this film- "" No one gives it to you, you have to take it.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
My favorite film of the year!,"Martin Scorsese's newest film, ""The Departed,"" will be sure to take audiences on a thrill ride they won't soon forget. The film has a great ensemble cast that's headed by: Leonardo DiCaprio (Billy Costigan), Matt Damon (Colin Sullivan), and Jack Nicholson (Frank Costello).""The Departed"" is a character driven piece that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The film follows an undercover cop, DiCaprio, as he attempts to infiltrate a deadly mob ring lead by Nicholson. Not to be out done by the police, Nicholson installs a rat of his own (Damon) to keep him abreast on police activity. The movie evolves into a cat and mouse tale like no other, with each side trying to determine who's the rat.For Scorsese fan they will be delighted to see that the man has not lost his touch. The films brilliant editing and camera work will make sure that your viewing experience will not be a dull one. Along with, the film comes with a great soundtrack, invocative of the streets of Boston.Great dialogue, directing, and performances make ""The Departed"" a must see film. Action, drama, comedy, this movie has it all. After seeing ""The Departed"" I cannot wait to see it again, and I encourage everyone to go see for themselves.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"2,5 hours of brutality, violence and massacres","The film is well made with great actors that are doing an excellent job, but it's actually a remake of a Korean film, which are notorious for their excessive brutality and violence. That is certainly not lacking here. The Korean original is much shorter, more efficient and intensive, while Scorsese has made his version as long and tedious as possible. There is very little action the first two hours, and mainly only talk and paranoid intrigue. But the worst thing is the language. The word ""f..k"" occurs in almost every sentence and at least in every scene. This extremely base and vulgar language with very little vocabulary and mainly used aggressively in constant outbreaks of anger and violence ruins the film and makes it deplorably void of style. Of what use then is the brilliant technique, the excellent actors and the splendid direction, if the film is just 2,5 hours of brutal criminality, atrocious violence, constant massacres and only foul language? Sorry, Scorsese has made a few great and interesting films, like ""Bringing Out the Dead"" and ""Shutter Island"", but this is not one of them.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Overrated - Disappointment,"Summary: Well directed, excellent actors, OK plot..I saw this movie a couple of days after I watched ""The Usual Suspects"" on DVD.. Compared The Departed is miles behind in both total quality and plot! Great humor, some nice violence.. Not the best photography I've seen and definitely not the most clever movie out there. But overall this is one of the best movies of this genre in 2006. Scorsese have done better before, but this is way better than Gangs of New York and some of his other later movies, and Hollywood in general..Overall worth the money, but I miss an even more clever plot, nothing actually happened that I couldn't predict!

Brilliant,"This was easily the best movie I have seen this year, maybe even this decade. This is the ""Goodfellas"" or ""Pulp Fiction"" of this decade. The story is put together by Scorsese so well that when it hits you it never lets up. The performances are top notch. Leonardo DiCaprio steals the movie from power man Jack. His character is so perplexed and caught up in this mess, you begin to feel his pity. Damon is excellent as someone who truly only looks out for himself and has no heart. The surrounding cast is also excellent surrounded by the power. Kudos to Mark Walberg and Vera Farminga. The Departed is so well paced that when the climax his it leaves you stunned.Unfourtanly when the climax begins it obvious the fate of all. Scorese gets this genre better than anyone. This is a movie about crime, but so much more. See it ASAP!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"The Dee-PAH-tid, as we say here.","Well, where to start? Martin Sheen gets Most-exaggerated-Boston-accent Award. Jack Nicholson gets Most-like-""here's johnny!"" Award (again). Alec Baldwin gets the He-really-looked-and-acted-like-a-local-Irish-American-bully-cop Award. No awards for Marky W... he was just playing himself back in Southie. Great retelling of a notorious Boston story. Can't wait to see the one about the Big Dig, Mr. Monahan. I hope Whitey and his brother Billy Bulger got a chance to see this one. I think Scorcese went a little Little Italy on the violence. Too many bullet wounds and not enough baseball bats and beer bottles, the more traditional weapons of Boston hoodlums. A gripping suspense thriller most of the time. A short 152 minutes. It's a shame that Monahan's villains met a moralistic end.

The new born departed,"This is a totally awesome movie from start to finish..a great cast..some undisputed performances...everything is almost perfect..From a Director that knows his best angles..specially in a story like this..comes a work of art that touches (even with such gore) and i might say that nobody expected the ending (unless there's a book ).All the actors have done an outstanding job but Jack performed ""crazy"".He is an actor which you can't get enough of watching..and although he was the bad guy (in a way) we still felt sorry for him in the end.My only disappointment is to the Head Shots scene..i think it was a little too ""fake"" ..specially because there was a key element missing (spoiler). All the Departed were the new born (as their life were turning points)!!! Go watch it..i's fabulous !",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Excellence in contrast and delivery,"As ever Scorese has brought together an array of outstanding actors. Jack Nicholson's performance is as usual competent and a well thought out character study. But the gem of the film is Di Caprio, he is awesome it is as though he is growing in stature and becoming a much more grounded actor with immense passion. He really does enlighten the scenes as his character continues to struggle with the conflicts and demons that he faces. He is in the same form as he was in The Aviator in which he deserved an Oscar nomination, maybe a little early to tip him for an Oscar, but certainly worth another Oscar nod for Best Actor.Scorese is such a clever director, this is probably the only mixed form film he has made. The film ventures to the two extremes of comedy and drama within this film, Scorese carefully delivers the most appropriate balance of comedy to lift the gloomy content within this film (for example the very last shot on the window as the film ends). He continually shows his early influences in many scenes, particularly the scene when Di Caprio is following Damon after the cinema visit (enough said don't want to spoil the story), this reminded me of Taxi Driver and Mean Streets.Another great partnership is the combination Scorsese with Schoonmaker's editing. She has won several Oscars when working with Scorese and this is certainly her best work. The editing is snappy and executed superbly, creating immense tension especially towards the climax of the film. Thelma Schoonmaker is an outstanding editor and deserves another Oscar, well done.The complex, clever and intertwining narrative enables the script to follow an excellent structure which never detracts itself away from the core action.Overall an excellent film, well done Scorese!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"By no means an ""Instant Classic"" but still worth your time","Well, I must admit this was the first movie I was dying to see in theaters for a long time while it didn't quite live up to the expectations I set, it was still worth seeing.The Departed sets the mood pretty quick which is good bad thing, as with most movies that follow that format, it quickly reaches a point where it begins to drag some when it came time to wrap up the film, things seemed a little rushed.Here's the basic premise Matt Damon's character is and up and coming Massachusetts police detective who has deep ties to a high profile mafia member in Boston (played by Jack Nicholson) he uses that connection to help further his own career while also keeping Nicholson's character from being arrested. The other main character is played by Leonardo DiCaprio Leo is sent undercover to keep tabs on Nicholson.So the plot of the movie becomes, who can catch who first? Damon is trying to help Nicholson find the ""rat"" in his group, while DiCaprio is trying to find the ""leak"" back at the police department who keeps tipping Nicholson off.It's a pretty cool premise that leads to some great dialogue and tense scenes. DiCaprio does a good job of portraying the ""tormented soul"" part who's in constant fear of blowing his cover Damon does alright playing the dual role of ""poster boy"" cop and smug, crooked cop Nicholson's plays his bad-guy character a bit over the top, but adds a nice comedic element to it in the process there are several ""laugh out loud"" moments in the film which don't disrupt its intensity.But what helps make The Departed an even stronger film is its supporting cast. Both Mark Wahlberg and Alec Baldwin serve as scene stealers who will have you chuckling to yourself. Martin Sheen turns in a nice performance as the head of the task force looking to take Nicholson down. Relative newcomer (at least in a movie of this scale) Vera Farmiga plays the love interest of Damon and holds her own. Anthony Anderson makes an appearance as well, but really seems out of place in a non-comedic role.Overall, The Departed was a very well written and entertaining movie my only quarrel came towards the end when there was an element introduced that produced one of those dreaded ""aw, come on"" moments from me.I'm not sure if this movie will have quite the replay value as some of Martin Scorsese's other works have had but it is definitely worth seeing if you're a fan of the genre or of movies in general.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Departed Affairs...........,"It would be a shame to compare this film to the Infernal Affairs trilogy, though I would admit that I enjoyed Infernal Affairs(still didn't watch the later 2) but you shouldn't look at this film like it was the finger print copy of the Hong Kong version because it's completely a different film. Yes the story and everything else is identical to Infernal Affairs, apart from the language and location. All cars are running on the same concept since the day they were born, you need wheels to drive you, you need an engine to drive the wheels, you need a fuel to drive the engine, yet how come we got over a hundred different car manufacturers when its the same design under the hood?...think of it like this, The Departed is a luxurious Italian car while Infernal Affairs is a luxurious British car :), the problem is people's taste, not everybody in the world love football. This is a great movie, great acting and the cinematography is just simple and yet so complex. Jack Nickolson is still a great actor, though he did act like he was the joker from batman. If you're going to watch this film then watch it like you've never seen Infernal Affairs and if you haven't seen Infernal Affairs then I suggest you watch both but don't compare them.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Scorcese's Long Overdue Oscar win is quite simply, a masterpiece","Martin Scorcese finally snagged a Best Director Oscar for THE DEPARTED and though there are some (myself included) who do not feel this was his best work, the film is more than worthy of the Director Oscar it finally nailed for Scorcese as well as the Oscar for Best Picture of the Year that it also received. This exquisitely mounted epic tale looks at the war between the police and the mob in South Boston, supposedly during the 70's and 80's, centering primarily on three characters. Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio)is a young cop with a shady family legacy, who is sent deep undercover to get the goods on renowned Boston mob boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Matt Damon plays Colin Sullivan, a young man who grew up working for Costello,a la Ray Liotta's character in GOODFELLAS, but also becomes a police officer. A two-way cat and mouse game ensues as Costello tries to learn which member of his organization is a cop while the police try to figure out which one of their officers is a stooge to Costello. The race to learn which rat is where advances to the point where Sullivan is actually assigned to, in so many words, rat out himself. Scorcese offers one of the greatest examples I have seen in years of storytelling on screen with a meticulous and detailed screenplay that requires complete attention, not to mention multiple viewings to fully appreciated the multi-layered story presented here. Scorcese's direction is crisp and in-your-face, as always, and surprises are offered around every corner of the story told here. Every time you think you've figure it out, the story takes another detour and if you miss anything, you will be confused. DiCaprio offers the best performance of his career as the tortured Costigan and he might have won the Oscar if he had been nominated for this instead of BLOOD DIAMOND. Matt Damon's richly complex portrayal of Collin Sullivan hits the bullseye as does Nicholson's expectedly ruthless mafioso. Mark Wahlberg received a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his razor sharp performance as DiCaprio and Damon's 2nd commanding officer who allows matters to get personal. Alec Baldwin, Martin, Sheen, Ray Winstone, and Anthony Anderson also register in strong supporting roles, but it is primarily the compelling story, masterful direction by Scorcese and the three electrifying lead performances that make this film an instant classic not to be missed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Meh, entertaining but nowhere near Marty's best work.","The Departed is a film with massive hype and expectation laid upon it, but unfortunately, it doesn't deliver.Nicholson: Plays himself. its not believable that he's a widely feared crime boss, there's too much larking around.Damon: He's too rigid. A man who has been brought up around the mob, would be violently bubbling with insanity under the surface, not a cross between Spock and Jason Bourne.DiCaprio: Terrific throughout.But his performance is distracted from, by the terrible casting of the characters around him. I'd have liked to see Michael C Hall play Sullivan.PS, how can some people compare this to Goodfellas...Different league!!!",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I thought it was boring...,"I didn't know who directed the movie until the credits when the name Scorsese popped up, so I saw the movie without any expectations. I must say I wasn't very impressed. First off the infiltration of Costigan into Costello's gang happened way too fast and wasn't very convincing, just like the infiltration of Leo's character in Gangs of New York. Mark Wahlberg's character Dignam felt really fake, the kind of language he used was not very likely to be used by someone in his position, same goes for Baldwin's character capt. Ellerby. The love triangle drama was just pathetic, why would she date some ex con with drug problems when she's already moving in with Sullivan, a career cop who climbs the latter in the department like a sky rocket (i.e. very unlikely). They tried to portrait Costello as this big time mobster but the way he handled business felt more like a small time gangster, stealing pocket change from some corner shop.I haven't seen the original Infernal Affairs so I can't say weather or not this was worse, but I would really think so. The only part that surprised me positively was in the end when the other mull showed up and blew Costigans brains out, I didn't expect that one. That kind of woke me up, too bad it was just before the credits.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Very good mob film,"The crime epic to end all crime epics- The Departed. The Departed marks Scorsese's return to gangster cinema, 15 years after his genre-defining Goodfellas. This time however, the scene is moved to Boston, the focus on the Irish mob. Two young cadets graduating from the academy; one a devoted law enforcement officer joining the state police undercover unit. The other, a mole from the mob who answers directly to Irish underworld kingpin Frank Costello, his mentor and father figure.It isn't long before both organizations start to suspect a rat in their midst. The real tension and excitement of the film stems from the two men's circular game of cat and mouse, as they each try to smoke the other out while simultaneously attempting to remain anonymous to their colleagues and each other. It gives a the film an ever-present, immediate sense of dread, particularly for Dicaprio's character which I see as kind of the answer to the typical undercover cop character; it's not some glamorous, slick job, it's stressful as hell! The film gives a more realistic view on what kind of toll that would take on a person, with life on death on the line every minute of every day and no time to cope with it.None of that to say the film is ""arty"", which it ain't! It's a bloody, coarse, lurid mess of a picture... in the most complimentary sense. While the film has more atmospheric tension, and is more plot driven than some of Scorsese's earlier work, there's still buckets of gore, plenty of shock value and some amusing soundtrack choices for some of the more grisly moments.Still, I wouldn't say I liked everything about The Departed, and wouldn't consider it in masterpiece territory. Some aspects of the film, and some of the characters I found less believable than others. And I thought Nicholson's character began verging on cartoonish towards the end. However, the film is an excellent showcase for Leonardo Dicaprio, who is electrifying in his frenzied, panicked state, as well as in his dialogues with Costello. While the film is clearly very much an ensemble piece, I would call him the standout.The Departed is a very good mob film. There're elements of it that have been done before, but the film's particular brand of rawness and high-octane tension elevate it above just another study/comparison of cops/criminals. Because after allwhen you're facing a loaded gun",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
It doesn't get any better than this,"Martin Scorsese has been a renowned film maker for quite some time but he has just now reached his peak. I was in sheer amazement after seeing his newest The Departed, remake of the Japanese version Infernal Affairs. Scorsese mixes his classic style of films like Goodfellas and Taxi Driver with a new age swing that makes for the ideal film.The film is about an undercover cop(Dicaprio), a high ranking police official(Damon), and an underground city crime runner(Nicholson). Also starring is Mark Whalberg, Martin Sheen, and Alec Baldwin. The movie is action packed from start to finish as a plot continually unfolds about a mole within the police station during the pursuit of Nicholsons arrest. All of these premier actors live up to their name as DiCaprio and Nicholson lead the way. Don't be surprised if Leo's name comes up during Oscar season. He really put on a performance not to be forgot. Nicholson also succeeded admirably. He creates a sense of intimidation up to DeNiro status.This film is by far the best picture I've seen this year and I don't see it being topped. I simply cannot think of a more entertaining, riveting, and well acted film I've seen in many years. I can't recommend it any higher. 10/10. Bravo Scorsese!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Scorsese is Back!!!!!!!,"The Departed **** out of ****Over the past 5 years, it seemed as though Martin Scorsese was spending too much time trying to win himself an Oscar for best director that the films he was making, though good, were not typical Scorsese films. Gangs of New York and the Aviator were both good films though it seemed as though I wasn't watching a Scorsese film. After viewing The Departed, all I can say is that Scorsese is back.This film almost seems to be a screw you to the Academy. He did his best to conform to Academy style to win his award and when all was done, Scorsese was left standing statue less. Now, Scorsese returns to a genre that has made him one of the best directors in the business. The Departed is a crime drama that is bloody and vulgar just the way Scorsese has made films in the past.The Departed has an all-star cast that includes Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg.Nicholson plays Frank Costello, a villainous crime boss who under the eye of the Boston Police and FBI. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Billy Costigan, a police cadet hired to go secretly undercover to be an informant Sheen and Wahlberg. It is later learned that not only does the authorities have an informant in Costello's crew, but Costello has an informant in the State Police.All the cast members give an outstanding performance. It is hard to say who had the best performance because they were all great. Nicholson, who has been doing a lot of comedies lately, reminds us just how great of a villain he can be. DiCaprio reminds us once again that he is a better actor then Titanic would suggest.Damon once again shows us why he is one of the better actors today. And though both Wahlberg and Baldwin both have small parts, they come across as great performances.The film runs in at about 2 1/2 hours but it certainly doesn't feel like it. There are no slow moments which is good for a long film. Scorsese has a brilliant talent for mixing a great soundtrack with a great film. Look at Goodfellas and Casino. Both of their soundtracks help push the films along. The violence is in your face as it should be with a story like this.In doing this film, Scorsese may bring himself a best director award at the Oscars without trying as hard as he did in the past. Many feel he was robbed back in 1990 for Goodfellas and it would only be fitting that he gets an award for this film being this film is his most violent since Goodfellas.

Best Movie This year!,"There were many reasons why i wanted to see this movie. The handful of talented actors, Martin Scorsese directed it and even the commercials were pulling me in. I couldn't help but go, which was a good thing i did. The movie had me leaning forward and gripping my arm rests the whole time. Martin made Boston seem like Brooklyn New York. A dangerous daring gangster movie. I was happy with every actors performance in this movie, Jack Nicholson was very different from his usual character, of course he's been evil before but he made his character menacingly evil. Other actors such as Mark Wahlberg,Matt Damon,Martin Sheen and Baldwin had stellar performances but what I think made this movie excellent was Leonardo Dicaprio. He was very involved with his character, made you involved with his character. You felt pain when he did. Made the movie almost seem real. If you watch this movie you won't get it out of your head until you see it again, which you will.

Scorsese Needs His Oscar ... and This is Worthy,"""The Departed"" -- what an awesome *expletive* movie! Yeah, it's another of those cop vs. bad guy vs. cop movies, but this is probably the best interpretation of that style of film-making that has come out in years, perhaps even decades. It's gritty, and vulgar, and violent, and yes, a bit overacted. But it's fraggin' entertaining, I tell you what! This film has so many great elements. First, and most importantly, it's a great movie to watch. It's very rare for a movie to be entertaining through-and-through, ""The Departed"" pulls it off. Most movies make me look at my watch several times, as if saying ""um, are they getting near the end?"" Not ""The Departed""! Most of the actors play their characters slightly over-the-top. Matt Damon's vulgar turncoat cop is excruciatingly squeaky-clean. Alec Baldwin's vulgar police captain is excruciatingly by-the-book. Martin Sheen's vulgar police lieutenant is excruciatingly trusting, loyal, and competent. Mark Wahlberg's vulgar sergeant is excruciatingly tough, combative, and vulgar (yeah, I used ""vulgar"" twice, and for good reason). And Jack, what can one say about Jack? His portrayal as crime lord Frank Costello is both over-the-top and subtle, for he really sells the idea of a powerful crime boss realizing his empire is falling apart.Now normally one would see these exaggerated characters as a negative in films, but in this case it works brilliantly. The film's core is Leonardo DiCaprio's conflicted undercover cop, Billy Costigan. He plays this very straight, and does a great job. What we are seeing is the world through Costigan's eyes, a regular guy's view of the ridiculousness of office politics in crime and law enforcement. When you're an undercover cop, the straight-laced police hierarchy (Baldwin and Sheen) seems comic. When you've overcome a tough childhood, phony toughness (Wahlberg) seems ridiculous. When you've struggled to make it in life, those who've had it easy but act otherwise (Damon) appear pathetic. When you're an honest guy thrown into a world of crime, the paranoia and wrath (Nicholson) seems otherworldly. By having these supporting actors put that bit of ""top spin"" on their characters, it gives us the viewpoint of the main character.This movie (as also suggested) is quite vulgar. Expletives tossed out at every turn, the petty (and not so petty) bickering and demeaning that fills up this world. This movie is *highly* quotable (something not said about too many movies today). Some of the lines are hysterical! Of course, this is Martin Scorsese, so the film is quite violent. But these comical interchanges between bitter rivals keeps it light, you're not drowning in a sea of blood but are peppered with comedy amongst the carnage.The writing, of course, is really top-notch. This is a clear case where the writing makes the movie. The writers did a great job keeping the plot complex and surprising, yet intimate. The banter between characters is superb. The plot itself is not wholly original, so you may think ""I've seen this before."" I suggest you pay attention to how the pieces are put together: this is more of a character study than an action film, although there's plenty of the latter. And they did a beautiful job making an ending unlike most films of this genre. You do want to watch it all the way through. I don't know what the qualifications are for an Original Screenplay Oscar, if this fits the rules then these guys should surely be nominated.The soundtrack is also terrific. I don't know who's doing that Irish-ska-punk sound heard at various points, but I'd love get one of their CDs.I would love to see Martin Scorsese get his Oscar. I'm not entirely sure if the Academy will give it to him for ""The Departed"". Personally, I think it's a great movie, well-crafted, and Oscar-worthy, but I could see how the voters may be put off by the violence, vulgarity, and over-the-top acting by the various leads.However, if the rest of this season is like the season that has already passed, full of uninteresting crapola, ""The Departed"" should be a shoo-in for at least a nomination.10 out of 10, a ranking I haven't used for many movies in 2006.Barky",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"""The Remake"" is what is it. A great movie, however","Other then the addition of an extra character to the movies script, (that played by Mark Walberg) this movie is in essence the very same plot and story as the movie it was taken from..... Infernal Affairs. That movie too won best picture of the year in it's respected country of China and starred local Chinese stars as well. Now don't let me sway you from this great movie. If you don't like foreign movies then you'll never watch the original and this is all you need to watch for a great thriller. But if you don't mind subtitles the better of the two comes from China.

Betrayal at its zenith.,"The Departed is excellent entertainment from some of America's best actors and one of its best directors. Not a totally believable story line, but who cares? It was believable enough to entertain and not lose the audience. It allowed good actors to do excellent work.The basic story is the head of the Boston Mob (Nicholson)plants an informant in the Massachusetts State Police (Damon)and the State Police plant an informant in the mob (DiCaprio). Both sides figure out there is an inside informant and go looking. The chase and final chapter are great action and great drama. The final 5 minutes are not what you expect which adds to the fun and entertainment. If you have trouble with blood and bad language, this is not your movie. The language and blood are not inappropriate to the story, these are mobsters not school kids.Jack Nicholson is still Jack Nicholson. With the right part, he is still one of the best. Matt Damon is wonderful as the mole and does some of his best acting. His character has no conscience and that fits the part. DiCaprio is a more difficult and troubled character, but he carries it well. Wahlberg (a state trooper supervisor) is an unlikable jerk, but does redeem himself in the end.If you go to movies to be entertained and enjoy a mobster movie, don't miss this one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Not the Best Movie Ever,"First, I like to comment on the brilliant performance by Leonardo DiCarpio and Jack Nicholson. I'm not a film critic, but DiCarpio and Nicholson had the best lines and the best scenes in the whole movie. The scene in the restaurant where Leonardo pleads his case that he is not the ""rat"", while Jack Nicholson sniffs his wine glass, eats a bug, and pulls a gun out on DiCarpio was entertaining, gripping, and climatic. Mark Wahlberg also put in a great performance with the limited facetime he received in the movie.The movie had twisting plots that at times confused me, especially at the beginning where I actually didn't know if DiCarpio was undercover or not. The scenes that he busted up the two guys in the store and him selling cocaine with his cousin probably was the reason why I was confused for so long. I know that some movies are not suppose to be spoonfeed to the audience and sometimes it takes mentally looking back at scenes to figure details out. This I don't mind at all, it's rather interesting.Overall it was a good movie, I don't give it the credit that many give it because the past week I was hearing it was Scorsese's best film, but it was lacking what films like Goodfellas, Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, and Raging Bull had. What I'm saying is that the movies I mention above had the street elements involved which in turn described how the characters grew up and acted like they were. This movie didn't have that, it had the accents, but I feel it lacked the quality neighborhood addage that many of Scorsese's films have.I do recommend this movie, it has some of the best current actors at or near their peaks. You may want to keep the children and wife away though.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Totally in-justification of a masterful script!,"What a waste to a masterful script! Scorsese has totally wrecked the script by polluting it with unnecessary profanity, gore, blood and tasteless sex scene. The only good thing about this remake is Jack Nicholson performance (except for the rubber penis). The original is thought provoking and make you want to see it over and over again. The characters in the original are captivating. The characters in the remake seems shallow and pointless. You don't feel for any of the characters, even the supposedly good guys, i.e. Martin Sheen, Mark Walberg and Leonardo DiCaprio because Scoresese did not care spending the time to build the story behind the 3, instead he just overloaded Walberg character with mindless swearing and stupid insults to DiCaprio.

Oscar for Best Editing,"Oscar for Best Editing. Oscar for Best Director, the only one in Scorsese's portfolio. Oscar for Best Screenplay, adapted from the script of the Asian film Infernal Affairs, which came out 4 years earlier. Oscar for best film, which was expected, since The Departed could only compete with Inyarittu's Babylon. I deem it necessary to consider the latter deserved in absolute terms, the picture is not without reason considered one of the best in its decade.Who else but Martin Scorsese knows how to make the viewer look at the prologue of his picture with one eye and immerse him in the much-loved criminal world of the great director. We are simply not willingly forced to concentrate on the screen for the entire two-hour-plus timekeeping, bite our nails and only occasionally glance somewhere to the side in order to share our admiration for this picture.Here we are simply dragged into the dynamic flow of scenes and destinies of the main characters.

Oh my god!! Do Not Miss!!,"Wow! I saw this movie the day it came out and it was all I expected and MORE!! Of course it had to be good with Scorsese directing, and starring Nicholson, DiCaprio, Martin Sheen, Mark Whalberg, etc. But, man, this movie had all the nail biting suspense and awesome action as Goodfellas! I almost can't come up with the words. All I can say is this had better win some Oscars, especially for Scorsese and DiCaprio, they both deserve them. Everyone must go see The Departed!! Now, I do agree with the last comment, though, if you have a weak stomach or don't like violence then this is definitely not the movie for you.

Masterpiece!,"The best movie of 2006! Brilliant casting & acting. Scorsese did it again! Topcast: Nicholson, Baldwin, Sheen, Damon, Wahlberg, Di Caprio. The Irish accent of one Nicholsons helpers is just marvelous. This masterpiece has the same quality as Goodfellas & Casino. Nicholson is one of the better and sure the most sadistic & flipped godfather in movie history! I'm not a big fan of Leonardo but I must admit that his acting in this movie is the best i've seen from him so far. Everyone who likes gangster/mafia movies has to see this masterpiece. One thing, don't be tired when you want to see the movie. Two hours & half, but never boring! 'As far as I can remember I always wanted to be a gangster!'",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Scorsese's Back!,"As an avid fan of the original ""Infernal Affairs"" I can say this one just about equals it. Borrowing a premise and a few memorable scenes, it creates an original vision by substituting the Irish gangs of South Boston for the Chinese mob of the first film.Jack Nicholson, as mob boss Frank Costello, creates an honestly larger-than-life character. A monster who chews scenery as only Jack could. The first scenes feature a younger Costello, roaming his neighborhood in the mid '80s, and help set the pace of the entire movie as he recruits and trains a young boy named Colin Sullivan--later to join the State Police in the form of Matt Damon.Leonardo DiCaprio gives what is probably the film's best performance as the other side of the coin, Billy Costigan, recruited by fatherly Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen) and his controversial colleague Sgt. Dignam (an explosive Mark Wahlberg). With few exceptions, DiCaprio has never really fit his roles (he was great in ""The Aviator,"" but he looked too young). Here he perfectly portrays the manic, stressful situation he's been placed in as the cop infiltrating Costello's crew of thugs.Both men end up falling for psychiatrist Madolyn (the very talented Vera Farmiga) in what feels like a Hollywood love-triangle. But given the rather low-key way it is played out, it doesn't feel too corny, despite the improbability.Alec Baldwin offers some hilarious scene-stealing moments as Damon's superior. And British actor Ray Winstone gives a cold, menacing performance as Costello's bodyguard, Arnold French.Scorsese's direction feels fresh, not necessarily from his style, so much as the cross-cutting style he uses feels so totally different from anything else out there recently. And his use of music, as always, works to great benefit.The cast is absolutely stellar. William Monaghan really gives these characters depth. Jack does too. And Scorsese is at the top of his game once again.All I will say about the ending is, I thought I'd never see a movie end this way. But to be vague, it's all tied up in the end.Will this movie win Oscars? Maybe. It's got the acclaim, but I still wouldn't be surprised if it gets overlooked for whatever reason.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Martin Scorsese as we like it,"Leonardo DiCaprio shines in Martin Scorsese's new gangster movie 'The Departed'. Mat Dammon, Jack Nicholson, Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen and especially Mark Wahlberg throw in their talents as well to make this one of the most entertaining films of the year. I would go as far to call this the most entertaining film Scorsese had made since the great 'Goodfellas', although his 'Casino'' came pretty close. This is simply what the man does best, lifting an average story up to greatness. This is not an attack to the original 'Infernal Affairs' on which this film is based on, which was great as well, but the Scorsese magic is seen here in all its glory.The plot circles around two infiltrating people. One of them is an undercover cop named Billy (DiCaprio) who joins the team of a gangster named Frank Costello (Nicholson). The other is one of Costello's man named Colin Sullivan (Damon) who joins the Boston police department. These two young men are trying to discover the identity of the other and at the same keep their own identity covered. Sheen, Baldwin and Wahlberg belong to the Boston police, all playing their part in this complex tale. I say complex, but Scorsese makes sure the audience knows who is who and why they act the way they do.I have said about enough about the plot, which is more fun if you do not know too much. For this film is probably best if 'Infernal Affairs' is not seen either. If you do not have too much problems with the bloodshed we have seen in earlier Scorsese films this is the film for you. Technically brilliant, uncompromising, and arguably the most entertaining film from 2006, from start to finish.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Scorcese does it again,"What can I say? This is the best gangster flick I've seen since Goodfellas. This movie had me engrossed the entire time and I definitely was not expecting the ending at all. I love movies like that. An all-star cast doesn't hurt either. The acting was excellent, though I think Mark Wahlberg's character was a bit over the top. His character was unlikeable, though at the end of this movie it works out, because the ending wouldn't have worked if he wasn't such a high-strung A-hole. The plot was simple yet intricate. A special unit of the police is out to round up a bunch of gangsters by placing a rat in the gang, only there's a slight problem. The gangsters have a mole working in the police department.I will say that I'm going to have to rent this one again to catch a lot of stuff I missed the first time through. I'm sure I'll enjoy it as much as I did the first time.Go out & rent this one along with Goodfellas, The Godfather, and Casino and have a great night of gangster action.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
This is the Martin Scorsese I missed for such a long time.,"Let's face it, Martin Scorsese has made some good movies the past few years but nothing too brilliant or remarkable, at least not compared to his more early work from the '70's, '80's and early '90's. The last real brilliant Scorsese was in my opinion the remake ""Cape Fear"", which dates back from 1991. But ""The Departed"" is really again a movie that deserves to be on the long list of brilliant Martin Scorsese movies.From the opening sequence on it's obvious; this is a typical Scorsese movie. For this movie he went back to the genre were he already was successful with in the past; the gangster-movies. It's a nice touch for a change that the movie is set in present time. After all, why should the best gangster-movies always take place in the past?""The Departed"" is a greatly told and constructed modern crime movie about an infiltrator in the state police and an infiltrator in a crime syndicate who have to hunt each other down. It's a movie that provides the movie with some thrills, unexpected twists (especially toward the ending) and some great confrontations between different characters. The story on its self is already quite good (Just loose the love-story next times. It adds nothing to the characters or story.) and interesting but it's made all the more great by the way it is told. Not only kudos to Scorsese's directing for that but also most definitely for the editing by Thelma Schoonmaker, with lots of good quick flash-forwards and other tricks. All I can say is that she really deserved her Oscar for this movie. It really helps to tell the story and give the movie a look and identity of its own.The movie its cast doesn't seem like the most likely won but it works out perfect in the movie. I think a lot of people were screaming for Robert De Niro but also Jack Nicholson is perfectly believable and just great as a gangster-boss. Mark Wahlberg was great as a bastard-cop and Alec Baldwin as a nice cop. The other way around would seem more logical but they work out surprisingly well in their roles. It was good to see Matt Damon in a more villainous and tougher role for a change, mostly because it shows how great as an actor he actually is. Leonardo DiCaprio also shows once more that he is more than just another pretty face.It's not a movie that relies on its action but more on its characters and story. The movie is exciting, tense and spectacular regardless of that it hasn't a lot of action in it.Of course this isn't Scorsese's best (which really says something about the extremely high qualities of this man), so is it fair that he finally won his Oscar for this movie? I mean after all, if this movie won, then should had movies such as ""Heat"", ""Training Day"" and so on. As a matter of fact it is of course true that if this movie was completely the same but had another director's name attached to it this movie would probably not had been nominated at all. It's just not the Oscar-type of movie but alas, I'm glad that Scorsese finally has an Oscar now, only just 3 decades too late.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Ratted Out,"I haven't been living under a rock, and neither have I been in a coma, but I just watched The Departed for the first time. I know, where have I been? My love for Scorsese films runs so deep, how did this movie pass me by for so many years? Anyways, I thought I knew what I was getting myself into when putting this on. I thought it would be some kind of worthy successor to Mean Streets, GoodFellas and Casino. Another Scorsese mob classic? Well, I wouldn't call it a classic. It's a very good film, i assure you, but it in no way compares to the genius of his very best films. It is hard to compare any mob film to the greatest mob film of all time, but when it's made by the same director and you notice all of these little setbacks, it's hard not to be slightly disappointed.The acting is by far the film's greatest strength, DiCaprio and Damon provide great intensity in their scenes, no matter how subtle. Jack Nicholson as Frank Costello definitely delivered the best performance. It's that same brand of craziness, and evil, that Nicholson does so well. As an interpretation of Whitey Bulger, it's pretty creative. This is much more of a grandstanding version of Whitey. Watch Black Mass, however, and you'll see a more entrancingly real portrayal of Whitey by Johnny Depp.The movie's mystery aspect had me very interested, and so did it's brilliant direction from Scorsese himself. This is, at the end of the day, an action picture. Reminded me a little of a ""Geezers with Guns""/Guy Ritchie film. Perhaps that is why I felt so differently about this film than his others. It doesn't have Scorsese's words, or even his ideas. That is kind of what draws me to his movies the most. When Marty has his own idea, and puts it to work, you can really tell the difference. His heart and soul is in the picture. Here, I think he just does an excellent job directing someone else's idea. What's sad is that this is the film that granted him his long- overdue Academy Award for best director. Really? This is the film that deserved it? Where were you all during Raging Bull?I'm being too harsh on a good film. It is a good film. Just not one that I'll think about when I think about one of my favorite directors.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Amazing Film--Stays With You Long After It's Over!,"OK, so I'm one of those people who likes indie films, and usually roots for them at the Oscars and so on. I watched Babel a few weeks ago, and that movie is REALLY GOOD (and I laughed so hard at Little Miss Sunshine, I think I peed myself a little), don't get me wrong, but there is something about The Departed that makes it basically a perfect movie. Obviously, the acting is perfect, so I won't waste your time on that. Why should you see this movie? Because of the incredible directing by Scorcese (who is not usually a favourite of mine) (I'll get back to this in a moment), and the characters that form from both the actors and the writing. So, the movie is about (NOT REALLY A SPOILER, but if you know nothing about the plot and don't want to, stop here) a cop who spies for the local gang lord, and a cop who is undercover in the gang lord's ring. But here's the thing, (and if someone has already pointed this out, I apologize for the repeat) and it's totally brilliant, they are basically the same character. They're from the same background, same age, roughly same characteristics. They are two sides of the same coin. And what makes it better is one leads a life of seemingly happiness, while the other just can't seem to win. To me, that's what makes this movie so incredibly GREAT!! And Scorcese directs this aspect of the film so perfectly, I just can't explain it. It's just perfect. Props to Monaghan (and the original Hong Kong writers) for doing this so well. And the thing I love about this is that as far as I can tell, it's really meant to be more of a gangster or action film, or that seems as though it was the original intent, but instead this jewel emerges and it's not about gunshots and running through dark alleys, drugs, strippers and whores, but about these two men and their lives in this brief intersection. INCREDIBLE MOVIE!!! SHOULD BE SEEN BY EVERYONE!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A note on why the Departed missed the point of Infernal Affairs,"One question to ask yourself when watching Scorsese's The Departed compared to the Hong Kong original Infernal Affairs. Scorsese didn't realise it was a remake until after he bought the rights to the script and didn't watch the original so as not to influence his vision. The result is a mixed bag. Do large budgets and A-list celebrities make a film better?The two films are separate enough not to be a straight-up American retelling, but the story is essentially the same. The Boston accents, and hilarious banter between the cops, especially by Walberg, who delivers some brilliant insults, are a fantastic addition. However, the one thing it lacks is the subtext of the original. Infernal Affairs was released shortly after the British handover, a time when a lot of Hong Kongers were experiencing an identity crisis. It was the perfect metaphor for the future of Hong Kong, being a mole in Chinese society to protect Hong Kong or vice versa. This was the real beauty of Infernal Affairs and something no budget or list of celebrities was able to replicate.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
So-So Effort,"I watched this movie (again) last night and it finally dawned on me what bothered me about it the first time I saw it. It's actually a pretty weak story. Too many big names.(very distracting). Pretty weak acting. Especially Sheen, Nicholson and Wahlberg. I really like Scorsese and Goodfellas is one of my all time favorite films but The Departed isn't even in its league. Jack shows up, well, as Jack. I think the last time Nicholson actually played a character, other than himself, Reagan was still in office. I don't buy him as a powerful Irish Mob boss for a minute. Wahlberg just yells and cusses a lot for no good reason. And Sheen looks kinda like he had a minor stroke before filming started. He looks like he's trying not to soil himself in every scene he's in. Not a bad movie but Best Film?? Really?? I also noticed the Boston Police Department is portrayed as an inept bunch of clowns who do nothing but yell, cuss, and argue instead actually doing any police work. 5 stars.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Hands down the best movie I've seen all year,"I expected The Departed to be an excellent film, but the final product blew me away. The story, the cast, and the direction were amazing. DiCaprio has improved with each performance he's given, and he is at the top of his game in this one. Damon plays a perfect foil, a smooth and sneaky character that was so easy to hate and yet remained empathetic. Nicholson was memorable as mob boss Costello, a twisted character that was made for him. The supporting cast, especially Baldwin and Wahlberg, were just as great.The story was engrossing from start to finish, and Scorcese presents it with style and visual flair. He uses music and camera angles to great effect. No one can deny he is a master of the trade. Monahan's adaptation is tight and balances story with character perfectly.Look out for The Departed come Oscar season.

The point of the movie was that there was a rat in the mob helping the cops and a rat in the cops. So now we had to find out what was going to happen. the story is pretty much based on the inner man giving info to the enemy(rat).

"""...Do you lie?""","The Departed is the most entertaining kind of non-stop, intense crime thriller of the year, maybe in the past few years. Some critics have said that it's the best film that director Martin Scorsese has made since Goodfellas. I understand where the compliment comes from, though I slightly resent the subtle criticism in the charge as well, meaning that Scorsese hasn't made a film as great or powerful or entertaining in over fifteen years. I would even go far as saying this is Scorsese's best since, well, Scorsese's last film, or at least since Gangs of New York. Some may forget, or maybe just not really take in, how consistently strong Scorsese's career has been overall, how he keeps on taking chances and still keeping his style so instictually 'cinematic' (he is possibly the biggest ""film-geek"" ever), so distinctive, and even so fresh in the 21st century, that his is a career akin to the likes of Kurosawa (many masterpieces, and otherwise very good to excellent efforts). The difference though this time from some of his previous outings- and this is perhaps the correlation with Goodfellas besides the obvious of genre linking- is that it's pure, devilish fun, it goes by quickly but supremely satisfyingly over what doesn't really feel like 2 1/2 hours, and it's cast is uniformly good.Leonardo Di Caprio in particular is so impressive here- and this may be the first-viewing-buzz talking, it might be my favorite of all the performances I've seen him in up till now. Under Scorsese these past several years he's kind of grown up more and more from the oddly pubescent look to him even in his 20's. His performance as Costigan is often very ferocious and tough, but he also makes it a fully rounded character, one that he makes very much his own. He has a dark past, almost too dark to even be an informant for the Boston PD. His whole family is messed up, and there were even links to Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). So, what better way then to send Costigan into Costello's wing and see what comes out? Then the flip-side comes with Matt Damon's Colin, who infiltrates the police department in legitimate fashion. Damon's is the flip-side as well in performance quality to Di Caprio; while Di Caprio, even when lying through his teeth, is truthful to the bone and always believable, Damon is pitch perfect as a bold-faced liar, as he never flinches for a moment, even when caught like a deer in the headlights.And the performances end up making a sort of square, with Damon and Di Caprio in their own corners, the bulk of the excellent supporting players (Martin Sheen, Marky-Mark Wahlberg, Ray Winstone, Vera Farmiga in a breakthrough role) on one, and Jack Nicholson all on his own. That was the first thing about hearing of the Departed that had me psyched, knowing that one of the great stars/actors of the past 40 years was teaming up with someone with a stature and track record like Scorsese's. With Nicholson in the role Frank Costello is at first already a character to feel is the 'man' in the room when he walks in and talks. But as far as performance goes, it's vintage Nicholson all the way, digging into it with the style, vigor, wit, charm, and all that and a bag of shark-grin chips that have made Nicholson so remarkable. His is such a dastardly character that it teeters on becoming self-parody, but both director and actor know how to reel the part in to being someone to fear, while also being someone who's a helluva lot of fun. It's worthy of an Oscar nomination, and not just because it's Nicholson in a movie.As for the director and his crew, they have assembled what could be by the bare essentials nothing more than a genre film with a premise that seems a little cooked-up. But, of course, it is a remake of a trilogy of Hong-Kong police pictures, so that may be why the premise and story feels not completely original, even as it's passing itself off as one. Yet that too didn't detract. If anything, I felt as if Scorsese was doing what very few filmmakers working today- particularly this year if you look at what's come out- don't do, which is to take material, and not just do a simple 'remake', but to do a re imaging, a refashioning, a full-on reinterpretation into the deeper aspects, in this case the morality and sense of loss among all of these characters. There's some religious bits put in, as it IS Scorsese after all, but this time there isn't something like in Mean Streets where it's always there in the background. Here the characters are on, like in Goodfellas, a version of hell, where things all do come to a head; the last thirty minutes had me laughing, cringing, and mouth-agape in equal measures.In other words, go see this film, if you think it might be up your alley, and you think you were burned by Scorsese ever since he left behind modern-time crime pictures ten years ago.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Took itself too seriously,"I'll admit the plot summary drew me to this as it had a great premise. The execution was just annoying. Wahlberg, DiCaprio and Damon were barely distinguishable. Coincidences were so contrived they were laughable. I think the problem was that this was made to be too serious. That plot and the over-the-top script would've made a hilarious comedy. In this genre it was just annoying and slow. They should've put a little more time into the end (from when they try to catch each other), instead of spending way too much time on the set up. Also, I'm not prudish, and I don't mind some cussing here and there, but it was gratuitous in this. Cussing punctuated every single sentence.",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Return to form, return to greatness.","Martin Scorsese has long been seen as one of, if not the, great American film directors. Film after film, he has continued to explore new pathways and areas of both cinematic and storytelling greatness in classic films that have stood the test of time. The Departed is such a film.This was Scorsese's most mainstream film to date (it has since been replaced by Shutter Island), and it featured an all-star cast that very few directors could ever pull together. All gave standout performances, particularly Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon. They are the key characters; everything goes through them and Scorsese uses close-ups of their respective faces to emphasize and emulate all the feelings and ideas he is presenting. With that in mind, they both are very convincing with the Boston accents, with the constant profane interactions and the extreme deviousness. Perhaps because they are both professional liars some viewers tend to criticize them more harshly; it can be difficult to feel empathetic for someone not necessarily true to themselves.The main underlying theme here is one Scorsese has tapped into again and again: guilt. Ever since his first film, Who's That Knocking at My Door? in which Harvey Keitel played a young man wary of his relationship with his girlfriend after finding out she was raped, the notion of guilt and its relation to faithfulness to the Catholic Church has dominated Scorsese's mode of thought. Here, guilt lies on all the characters. Each of them completely embody the new life they are to now acquire. Colin Sullivan (Damon) is a clean-cut kid with an immaculate record as well as a former gangster turned State Police sergeant. He is the perfect tool for Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) to use to keep the cops on their toes and his business alive. On the flip side, Billy Costigan(DiCaprio) is a kid with family connections to South Boston gangsters attempting to make it into the State Police. He is assigned to inform for the police into Costello's organization. Right from the get-go, Scorsese establishes the pain and pressure these two will face in regards to their professional compromise.Another buried element here is the idea of identity. What exactly is it to these men? What is their true identity and how can they get it back? Because Sullivan and Costigan spend so much time pretending to be what they are not, eventually they get caught up in attempting to succeed at a job that isn't really theirs. In some ways, Scorsese creates an atmosphere that is deliberately contrary to that of his 1990 masterpiece Goodfellas. In that film, everything rested on the joy Henry Hill had in committing crime and living the mafia life. Here, these emotions must be subdued, lest someone get caught and possibly murdered.In the end, I believe this is one of Scorsese's best films along with Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, After Hours, Goodfellas and The Age of Innocence. All of the aforementioned films tell stories of men conflicted with living how they are told and how they are able to. Here, Costigan and Sullivan symbolize that. On top of all the underlying themes, this is just a very well-made cop and gangster picture. The acting is superb, the editing is so sharp and jolting so as to keep the tension and suspense alive, the cinematography greatly captures the tender living conditions in Boston, and of course Scorsese's Oscar-winning direction corrals everything together to create one gloriously entertaining film. It is a return to classic Scorsese form as well as Scorsese greatness.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Masterpiece!,"I don't get it... How did Martin Scorsese manage to make this movie so great? Well, more or less, everything was at least close to perfect. Somehow, Scorsese figured out a way to combine violence and humor in a way that is anything but cheesy. And that's only one of the incredible accomplishments of The Departed.Above all else, the characters are so well developed and so likable that even if the plot was awful, I'd still watch this movie. You're looking at a diverse set of characters, who all have some little thing about them that makes it impossible not to find them interesting. I couldn't believe it! And then, you have the plot. Just what you might expect, there are a good many peaks and troughs of action in this movie. But the whole time you're wondering how it's going to end, which makes it possible to avoid the ever-so-cheesy extreme plot twist, while still keeping the audience guessing. And as complex this movie is, everything comes to its neat little conclusion at the end, and there isn't a single question that hasn't been left open beyond necessity. Well done, Scorsese!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"2006's Golden Goose. Better yet, Scorsese's Golden Goose","This has everything a movie lover could want. Great plot, brilliant storyline and acting that you could die for. This is the golden goose of Martin Scorsese and of 2006. This is what Infernal Affairs U.S is. Guns, Action and a nasty Jack Nicholson which movie buffs have been wanting since his brilliant performance many years ago in 'Batman' as The Joker. If you want a film that shocks, surprises you and leaves you hungry for more, 'The Departed' IS this film.The plot is pretty basic and understandable and the blurb tells you a lot. But you can follow through without becoming all confused (ala Matrix) and the story becomes more and more interesting. You start rooting for the good guys during this one even though the bad characters are really excellent. Especially Ray Winstone. He has a scene with Leonardo DiCaprio that just leaves you breathless (the scene in the bar for those who've seen it).This is Scorse's Golden Goose, all right. :)",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Outrageously good,"For me, 2006 has been a fairly mediocre year at the cinema. Too many films with excessive special effects that weren't essential to the plot of the film (aside from the fact that most of them had razor thin plots anyway). For me, Departed has blown all the other films I've seen this year clear out of the water. I've been reminded why all of the major actors in this are rated so highly. They've all turned in either medium or mega sized turds in their careers, but they should all rightly be proud of this.I'll spare you the synopsis of the film. IMDb's own synopsis plus other comments have done that for me. I'll go into the performances themselves.Leonardo DiCaprio turns in arguably his most gripping performance since Basketball diaries or Gangs of New York. A slushy lovable character he certainly isn't in this film; self assured and confident at the beginning, by the middle of it Billy Costigan is a total wreck - still on the right side of the law but losing his mind as he comes ever close to being uncovered and brutally, viciously killed.Nicholson's Irish accent is next to non existent, but you don't care. He's menacing beyond belief, a particular scene coming to mind between him and DiCaprio when he nonchalantly waves around a severed hand whilst having breakfast to make a point. DiCaprio's character is terrified.Damon has always been pretty damn good with everything he touches seemingly turning to silver if not gold, but he effortlessly plays a bent corrupt cop who is ultimately out of his depth. Colin Sullivan (his character) will stop at nothing to protect himself and you get increasingly incredulous at how low he'll stoop. Watch for the scene with him in his office on a walkie talkie as he tries to frame another member of the unit to save his own neck (I'm not saying who). It's chilling.Mark Whalberg provides some black comedy, useful for breaking up the tension and rebuilding it once more. He might (or might not) be bent, but ignore his character at your peril - he's more key to the plot than you realise. The dead pan double routine about sleeping with his bosses sister (played very well by Alec Baldwin - the boss who is out of touch with the brutal truth) who in turn asks how his mother is is great fun.Make no mistake, Scorsese makes a film with good potential in a fabulous film and will deservedly take much credit for it. It's pretty damn impressive right up until DiCaprio and Damon come face to face; the conclusion of the film will ram itself right in your face and leave you outraged, brutalised, exhilarated and stunned. It's the fastest 2 1/2 hr film I've ever seen and I am seriously contemplating going back to watch it again - something I've not wanted to do since I saw Sleepers - and wasn't that a long time ago... This is really as good as I (and everyone else) is making out. A definite must watch, it's bound to pick up a couple of Oscars next year..",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I don't like any crime series but this movie kept my eyes sharp the whole time,"Jack Nicholson's acting as a madman boss is very entertaining and the plot is great. If you want to keep up with this movie you must keep your attention in the film all the time. The ending was the worst part of the movie in my opinion.

Perfect,"The perfect ensemble delivering believable dialogue in a marvellously photographed movie. What more can you ask for £6? I was a little nervous going to this film (I still haven't got over Gangs of New York, which IMHO was a shadow of the film it should have been). Could Marty serve up a spectacle that matched the hype? Would he be able to corral the all-star cast while still allowing enough artistic freedom? Would Jack chew every single scene to shreds? The answers to these questions is an unequivocal YES, YES, YES.I loved every minute of it and was wrong-footed more than once by the surprise plot twists. What could have been a very predictable good cop/bad cop movie was lifted to Oscar favourite status by sublime direction and a rich screenplay that will, I'm sure, become every bit as quotable as Goodfellas in the years to come.DiCaprio and Damon are fantastic as the hunters/hunted. DeCaprio has one brilliant scene in particular where the stress of living the undercover life is obvious in his nervous twitches but the Oscar will surely go to Jack Nicholson. He overplays his role to perfection and effortlessly dominates every scene. He plays a perverted psychotic killer who clearly enjoys his job but it's still our Jack and I couldn't help smiling as he revelled in his g(l)ory.Mark Wahlberg also deserves a special mention - haven't seen him do anything half as good as this before.Go and see this film and expect to be entertained.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
no goodfellas,"I folk can remember the impact of Scorceses (spellink?) Goodfellas and a fine (if violent) film it is. The Departed will probably be hailed as a return to that fine form, but I hope folk are paying carefull attention, because apart from a few notable one liners, it really is too much the remake and not an individual film.The story is complelling enough, but not enough twist potential is made of the rich characters created in this version - which has always been the directors strength. Jack Nicholson, however, seems a bit reigned in, leaving acting credits to Leonardo for the main cast, but the supporting cast pulls some surprising irons out of the fire. Alec Baldwin as the furious sweaty police captain and Martin Sheen as the proverbial good cop show there is more to casting than who is popular at the time.Good but not fab.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

DiCaprio I give an A for effort. The female psychologist roles is the worst. I couldn't sit through this and I am from Boston. Unless you are a cell phone salesman.

Simply put: Incredible,"All that needs to be said about this movie is that it tops scarface, good fellas, boon-dock saints, and blow. movies that I thought were once not again attainable because of the way writers write now days.

This movie's special effects are right where they need to be and NOTHING looks fake or over the top, the acting is nothing short of perfect, the directing WILL win for best directing, the writing is actually really good writing, and the movie; probably at the top with the best movies ever made. One thing that I really like about this movie is that I was never bored. From the first second of the movie i was interested and wanted to see more. One thing that I didn't like, was that it ended.

He shows his passion, integrity, and ambition.The plot moves smoothly and very understandably. The pace is very well tempered.

"""The Departed"" Won't be Leaving Anytime Fast","There were a couple complaints about this film's length during my screening, as clocking in at just over two and-a-half hours, it's a long movie. But there's a big difference between good long movies and bad long movies, which this is most certainly the former. The time flew by and not once did I find myself checking my watch. That being said it was also a fairly original idea, despite actually being a foreign remake. I think it's definitely safe to say that none of the important parts were lost in translation during the conversion. The finished product easily did justice to the original, especially considering how poorly the majority of Americanized releases have turned out lately.As far as the acting as a whole was concerned, it was way above par. Jack Nicholson effortlessly played a great insane gangster, whose level of psychosis steadily increased. Alec Baldwin was hilarious as the dedicated but extremely sarcastic administrative officer. In fact I think it was the combination of these two characters that led to the perfect blend of comic relief that made it much easier for the conservative audience members to digest some of the harsher subject matter. The star turn was definitely put in by Leonardo DiCaprio, who displayed such naturally conflicted emotions and added so much inside depth to his role that at times it was even scary. Leo's both physical and various forms of mental anguish could be felt by all. I could really feel what he was going through the whole time without ever having those exact same experiences. This is one time where it'll be tough to ignore him at the Oscars again. Matt Damon gave a pretty flawless performance, but it also felt that he had the least interesting of all the characters despite having a lot of screen presence. Mark Wahlberg was surprisingly good in a different role than he's accustomed to, although he did drop his accent a couple times. Somewhat newcomer Vera Farmiga was passable, but not overly convincing and did seem to get clunky.Overall the character development could've been better as the viewers just received a surface glance at them, but I wound up caring for most of the individuals regardless. The cinematography was excellent and contained some beautiful scenes of Boston along with some not so desirable shots of its seedy underground. The soundtrack was amazing and not just for the wonderful songs themselves. They really heightened the emotions by being blasted at some intense scenes as well. Needless to say this particularly grabbed my attention. Finally, the editing was tight which also helped with the quick pacing and the script was smoothly written into several layers but at the same time not being formulaic. Even if the scenario mainly dealt with translating the ""Infernal Affairs"" story for audiences over here.This was a highly enjoyable flick and I fully recommend it on just about every level. In fact, my only real problem with it was that the ending felt rather contrived and was a letdown. It turned messy quickly and was going all over the place when the filmmakers were trying to tie everything together. Not too mention also highly improbable. Notwithstanding, if you can overlook that, then you'll be in for a real treat as usual from Martin Scorsese. This is without a doubt his best film so far this decade, and could quite possibly be right there under ""Goodfellas"". It's fairly ironic that the title is ""The Departed"", because I was so intrigued that I didn't want to leave.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Perfection!,"I'm a huge Scorsese fan, so I was extremely excited to see the Departed. The movie was as good, if not better then what i expected. LIke people have said, it's Scorse's best film since Goodfellas, or Casino. He seems to be returning to what he loves best: Organized Crime. It's also the first movie that I've been surprised at in years. Mostly, movie plots are fairly easy to figure out, but this had me bouncing of the walls. It has a high body count, which is always fun, meaning, classic violent scenes, only Scorsese could make look poetic. The Entire cast is perfection. Leonardo DiCaprio was it his best, ever. He became Billy Costigan, to the point were you felt that what Billy was going through, were actual moments of Dicaprio's life. Matt Damon as always was good, though not as good as Leo. Jack Nicholson, well, what can you say about him? That he is amazing. Another perfect performance. Mark Wahlberg really surprised me, he was somewhat the comic relief of the movie, and stole the screen every time he appeared. Every inch of this movie was great, and i can't wait to see it again. Scorsese, your the best there ever was! Love, Simone",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Fair, but nothing spectacular","The Departed left me cold, much as many in the movie end up. It was fair, but fell far short of the hype that has been heaped on this flick. Plodding in the middle, with a lot of unnecessary exposition, the movie is too long - perhaps a sign of Scorcese's age. It is nowhere near the level of Casino or Goodfellas, but the plot is interesting. The last 25 mins make the movie exciting. Unfortunately, it closes on a note that makes me question what the actual point was. Acting was generally good. Nicholson, DiCaprio and Damon turn in decent performances (especially DiCaprio, who I doubted could pull off a tough-guy role). Wahlberg's character is extremely irritating and unrealistic. There is no way that a character like his would be present in such a high-ranking position at the state police level. Sorry - people just don't talk like that. I didn't find the movie any more violent than any of the director's previous work (perhaps even less so). However, a major problem I have is that the movie goes out of its way to be VULGAR. I found it quite tasteless and it detracted from my enjoyment of the film. There was a lot of nasty sexual talk in reference to women, etc that not only made it difficult to enjoy with my girlfriend, but felt unnatural. There is also plenty of racial humor to throw around which could possibly be overlooked for the sake of realism, but in light of all the potty mouths also comes off as a bit much. No better than your average misogynistic rap video, I hate to say it, but I don't think this should've been released as an R. It is worse than that. With its decent acting, witty lines and intensity nearly derailed by it's vulgarity, watch and weep for the end of taste in Western cinema.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Great Film; liked it better the second time I watched it.,"This is definitely something new for Scorsese, and I liked it. He delves into the Irish mob this time around, and it allows him to switch things up.It has everything every moviegoer would like to see, and it sets a pretty good deliberate theme about being a 'rat.' Matt Damon, DiCaprio, and Nicholson all have a great take on an Irish accent and play their part well. Especially Nicholson. ;)So yeah, in closing, take some time out to watch this artistically beautiful movie, and remove the fact that it won 'Best Picture' from your head.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Better than Aviator or Gangs, worse than Goodfellas","If The Departed had been directed by anyone else, especially someone without the pedigree of Scorsese, I would have been pleasantly surprised and left the theater more than satisfied. However, movies like Goodfellas, Raging Bull and Taxi Driver have infected me with an extremely high standard for anything with Scorsese's name on it, and while this movie is good, it is not in the same league as those classics.To begin, Scosese probably went a little over the top with casting. I realize that big names bring big bucks, but having dominating talents like Alec Baldwin (if you don't agree, see Glengarry Glen Ross or any one of his stints in SNL) or Martin Sheen in supporting roles is distracting. Such recognizable faces removed any sense of anonymity or realism from those roles -- they felt more like cameos than real characters. Not that Scorsese is the first to make this mistake; The Thin Red Line suffered from this same fatal flaw.There were also some underdeveloped relationships that I had trouble sinking my teeth into. In particular, the affair between Vera Farmiga's and DiCaprio's characters seemed contrived, particularly later in the movie when I wondered what exactly DiCaprio ""wasn't there for."" It's not that the actors failed to do there jobs adequately; it's more like there was some critical scene left on the cutting room floor that would have explained the characters' behavior towards the end of the film.On the plus side, for the first time in a Scosese movie, I was not annoyed by DiCaprio's presence. While he still looks young, this movie called for a younger actor. This is in stark contrast to The Aviator, where DiCaprio looked like a child with a mustache glued on his lip. Nicholson was fun to watch, of course, and Damon gave a particularly strong performance as a charming alpha male with a menacing streak lurking just beneath the surface. Mark Wahlberg is from Boston and therefore has the accent down pat, but I thought his dialog was a little over the top. This is not his fault really; the writers probably could have better developed the reasons behind why Wahlberg's character hated DiCaprio, and most the other characters for that matter, so much.I suppose I probably went into the movie having the wrong expectations. Not every movie can detail the rise and fall of a criminal family. Had this movie been too much like Goodfellas, I'd be complaining about Scorsese riding his own coattails. Looking over the reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, apparently I'm alone in thinking this movie is not the next American Classic. I wish there were some way to see Scorsese's next movie without knowing he directed it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

What happened? You see DiCaprio, Damon, Nicholson and all the other stars and you have a masterpiece? That's not what I thought cinema was. I've seen both versions, in fact I have it on DVD. The Departed is a great movie, that's true. But it's nothing more. I can't understand why Martin changed so many things and he still thought it would be the same story but told in a different words. This is not about Italian Mafia!!! This is about Chinese mafia, and that's not the same!!! Please, everyone who enjoyed The Departed: Take a look on Infernal Affairs.

"""I don't want to be a product of my environment. I want my environment to be a product of me.""","The first lines of this movie are said in a monologue by Jack Nicholson's mob-boss character Frank Costello. He starts with, ""I don't want to be a product of my environment. I want my environment to be a product of me."" This line essentially sums up the movie even before it begins. The Departed is an Americanized version of a Hong Kong filmed called Infernal Affairs, and tells the story of two Boston state troopers--one goes undercover and works against the Costello gang from within (Leonardo DiCaprio's Billy Costigan) and one works for the Special Investigation Unit while still on Costello's payroll (Matt Damon's Colin Sullivan). Each one lives in a world of deception, each trying to keep their real motives a secret from their adoptive bosses, each trying to out maneuver the other. The Departed ends up being a 150 minute long cat and mouse game between two guys who are referred to as rats in the entire movie. At first, each takes to their responsibilities with vigor and enthusiasm, with Costigan having the more difficult assignment, trying to infiltrate a gang who all knew he was once a cop. As the movie goes a long, we feel the noose tightening around each, as both characters go through moments of dread and loss, until the bloody ending where all of the characters who deceived and schemed ended up getting a suitable punishment. Each character in the movie imposes their outlook on the world on their situations, as each one makes their own luck, so to say, as the first line uttered by Nicholson alluded to. None of the characters are the result of a predetermined destiny, as everyone made decisions on their own and had to live with their results. As Costello said, their environments were all products of their own actions. As far as Scorsese's direction goes, it is as usual top-notch, with quick cuts when quick cuts are needed, a neat opening that gives about as much background information as we viewers could possibly need in a fast-paced 15 minutes before the opening credits even finish, a fine selection of music (almost Tarantino -like in how the music matched each scene), and as much violence and obscenities as you could possibly get in two and a half hours. Boston makes for a fascinating location for a movie such as this--a rich subtext to each character, the possibility for interesting supporting players, and a gritty street life that makes it a poor man's version of New York City, without having thousands of movies made about it already. The one problem with the Boston setting is the accent thing--some of the characters lose the accent then it magically comes back. This is always a concern when it comes to Boston movies. Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen are terrific as high-level police officers, and Mark Wahlberg goes all in with his portrayal of the salty Sergent Dignam. But the real stars are DiCaprio and Damon, each young actors who have really developed into well-rounded portrayers of emotion and gravitas. Yes, DiCaprio may never really leave the Titanic, but here he shows he can act in a subtle, yet strong roll in a Scorsese movie that is almost as good as Goodfellas.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

What's the Difference?,"Greetings again from the darkness. I will admit it upfront. It is very rare that I don't enjoy/appreciate/respect Martin Scorcese films. What I will say to his detractors is this is his best work since ""Goodfellas"". Yes it is based on the 2002 Hong Kong film entitled ""Infernal Affairs"", and Scorcese is so respectful that he actually notes this in the closing credits.Prepare for a a no-holds-barred all out blazing explosion of film making! And so much fun to watch. If the ""f"" word bothers you, stay home. It may rival any Tarantino flick for harsh, but real in-this-world language. If violence bothers you, stay home. There are some moments of extremely brutal and realistic violence and bloodshed. On the other hand, if you are a fan of complex story lines, amazing cinematography, top level acting and crackling dialogue, rush out now to see this film.Oh my ... the acting is as good as it gets (pun intended) with Jack Nicholson as the personification of EVIL as Mob boss Frank Costello. This is a very bad man and Jack is in his element. Sure the guy is a great actor and can pull off fluff like insomnia with Diane Keaton, but this is the Jack that we have loved for decades. He literally spews venom with his lines and facial expressions. Matt Damon, back in his Boston comfort zone (remember ""Good Will Hunting"") pulls off the role of informant with a truly believable lack of conscience that will hit you in the gut. Now what to say about Leonardo DiCaprio? I promise to never call him ""Little Leo"" again! He is now a man and flashes the acting maturity that Scorcese has been pushing him towards for a few years. Sure, he steals some mannerisms from DeNiro (watch him flick a cigarette) but his simmering emotions are plastered on his face throughout and trust me when I say, this dude has a LOT of emotion!.As is Scorcese's custom, the supporting actors are also solid, believable and disappear into their roles. A bloated, washed-out Alec Baldwin is remarkable. Martin Sheen is fine and Mark Wahlberg had to be laughing out loud when he first read his lines ... I know I was! Few could pull off three or four of Wahlberg's hilarious lines without sounding like a stand-up comedian instead of a wily, veteran cop. Also fun to watch is relative newcomer Vera Farmiga who falls for both Leonardo and Damon in what is one of the few story lines that could have been better developed.Toss in Scorcese's legendary pacing and camera action, an eclectic soundtrack that somehow combines the Rolling Stones, Van Morrison singing Pink Floyd (""Comfortably Numb""), Badfinger and Dvorcak, and the most complex use of cell phones yet, and you have one amazing film that will keep you glued to the screen.

It's okay,"I found this movie to be rather boring. I love Martin Scorcese's other films, and when I saw this one win so many Oscars, I expected something as good as Goodfellas, which is a true masterpiece. The acting was great, and the cinematography was pretty good, but the story barely held my attention. About an hour and a half into it I wanted to turn it off, but was compelled to finish it, hoping for some really cool plot twist. I figured that must be the reason that everyone liked it so much. Perhaps there was too much hype, but I was extremely disappointed. I just don't see what all the fuss is regarding this movie. Most of the movies that are coming out of the studios nowadays are complete garbage. So now Scorcese makes a pretty good movie, and people think it belongs in the top 50 of all time. We're becoming complacent and settling for less. This movie is good, but not that good.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

DiCaprio, Damon and Jack Nicholson is at their best with insane amount off attention that just flows through the entire movie. There is a lot off brutal violence that is not for people that like that kind of stuff, if you don't like blood and gore I wouldn't recommend the film.

I am meaning no disrespect or saying ""you are wrong!"" to the people who liked this film! I saw this film the other night, and well from the off I thought it was absolutely terrible. The script just seemed to be full of macho swearing nonsense and very little else - however the premise of two parallel characters was very interesting, and I thought DiCaprio did his role justice - but the film never took them anywhere near the depths that would have made it truly engaging. There seemed to be lots of contradictions - jack nicholsons character was painfully 2 dimensional and so very unrealistic. I mean no one is that superficial are they? Banging on about p***y and money to illustrate a personality doesn't seem to suggest much of one, especially not a complex individual who would be dancing the fine line of crime and citizen. Even the tag line is a bit of a car crash cliché (the one about barrel of a gun blah blah blah). Is anyone else fed up with this Hollywood-fed nonsense dressed up to be ""gritty"" or ""real"" or ""profound""? People seem to love this film - what has happened to telling a good story well!",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Mark Wahlberg haters ...die,"I do not get why all these people are saying that Mark Wahlberg sucked in that movie. That was actually one of the movies that he was good in, and anyone who thinks otherwise is an idiot.The dialog was flawless from the beginning of the movie to the very end, Scorsese indeed has another masterpiece on his hands. I was very disappointed to see all the critics saying that Wahlberg delivered a terrible performance. ""F**k"" was used excessively, but I haven't seen a good movie that didn't have ""f**k"" in it every 3 seconds e.g. Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs. He played a role that took a lot of balls I guess, and he did it pretty damn well. My favorite line was definitely, ""Maybe, maybe not, maybe f**k yourself."" Again with the flawless dialog.Directors like Scorsese and Tarentino really capture small talk moments that capture real life perfectly. They give you a different view than that of a happy utopia that so many movies portray. Utopia is bullshit. This movie goes into the heart of human behavior, and gives you a lot of good laughs along the way.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Fabulous Scorsese movie, watch it 3-4 times","The movie starts from a childhood of Matt Damon and then he is in military training courses with Dicaprio. At the final stage, Damon is accepted to be police but Dicaprio is rejected. Police and Mafia want to have rats in each organization. Damon and Dicaprio, who was once rejected are employed. Many meetings of Mafia and the reactions of the police are betrayed. So the police decides to choose Damon to find the rat inside, unaware of he is the rat himself. After lots of great scenes, the rats are found. This movie has to be watched at least 3-4 times. But I think it had some mistakes, i.e. ending parts of movie, in the elevator, Dicaprio is very amateur, never a police stands besides the hostage, always behind it. But the death of Capitain was wonderful. It shook me up. Martin Scorsese's movies are always great.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
No respect!,"This remake of ""Internal Affairs"", a great movie in its own right, adds a Whitey Bulger-John Connolly Boston twist that just BEGS for brilliance - it's a can't-miss story line with a powerhouse cast.However, it's a huge disappointment. Despite such compelling material, Scorsese only skims the surface, opting for gloss instead of substance, adding confusing sub-plots that serve mainly to hook the audience. These sub-plots destroy the momentum of the film and pull the whole thing off the tracks. Without these (no spoilers), the film may have had a chance. Scorsese's trademark violence stingers are now overripe at best. Am I the only one who started to yawn when people were getting pounded over a loud soundtrack in ""Casino""? I doubt it...There is some pretty silly ensemble work here, too - we're not talking ""Glenngary Glen Ross"" or ""The Usual Suspects"" here by any stretch. Most of the bad highlights usually involve Wahlberg's profane fool of a character. Overall, the individual characterizations seem to be either shrill, as in the case of the annoying Wahlberg and chest-thumping Damon, or flat, like Sheen's police captain. Nicholson's Whitey Bulger take is completely lacking in menace - it's amusing, if nothing else. Only DiCaprio's brooding Billy Costigan stands out, but he's got nowhere to go, both literally and figuratively - the sub-plots basically turn his character to face the wall...Much has been made of the ending here, but I would describe it with one word - ""cowardly"". I just couldn't respect this film much, particularly in light of ""GoodFellas"" and other Scorsese masterpieces. Overall, 4 stars and only because it's him - probably the worst best picture Oscar since ""American Beauty"".",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Copycat script unseemly in a film with such pretensions,"I saw Infernal Affairs just two weeks before I saw The Departed. I can't understand how a film (and its director and screenwriter) that so completely mimics the Chinese original, scene for scene, with bits at the beginning from the old Boston Globe series on Whitey Bulger's predatory treatment of young Southie girls and their families, has received so much praise, let alone Oscars for scriptwriting and direction, which would seem to require some substantial originality and creativity. The acting and technical aspects of the film, e.g., cinematography, were fine, but the copycat nature of the script, taken from a fine foreign film that was barely out of production itself, left me feeling like someone had cheated.Perhaps I am missing something, but I did not feel any such disappointment in the American remake of the Seven Samurai, i.e., The Magnificent Seven, because I felt that the scriptwriter and director in the second of that pair, while keeping the general plot outline, made many more substantive changes in the story.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Scorsese goes back, once again to gangsterland.","The Departed tells the story of two men working for the Boston state police; one is mole working inside the mob, and the other is a mole working for the Irish mob boss. Leonard DiCaprio plays Billy Costigan, the cadet police officer sent undercover to infiltrate the Irish mob, which is headed by Frank Costello, played by the wickedly wonderful and outrageous Jack Nicholson. Matt Damon plays Colin Sullivan, the mole inside the police force that tips off Costello on the police's activity while trying to put him away. Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg also star as police officers that are heading the investigation into putting Costello and his whole crew behind bars (or in a casket). Costigan works his way into the mob and Sullivan works his way up into the internal affairs unit of the state police, who is actually sent in to investigate who's been tipping off the mob.You can see a bunch of Scorsese's touches throughout the film; from his music selections (great use of Dropkick Murphys, but The Rolling Stones song is getting a bit old now), to long tracking shots and plenty of disturbing outbursts of violence; which hit you like a sledgehammer to face in the film's final moments. Where The Departed really shines are the performances. DiCaprio is great, and this is probably his best performance to date. Damon comes through, but he won't exactly blow you away, he usually delivers good work and he doesn't disappoint here. Nicholson is a scene stealing weasel that will probably be compared to, and loved much like Pesci's wild and crazy work in Goodfellas and Casino. Nicholson is perfectly cast and has a lot of fun playing a character so wildly evil and nefarious you just love to hate the son of a bitch. And what's up with Alec Baldwin? Seriously, when was the last time he was in a film this good, and seemed to be having so much fun. And Martin Sheen was also good, but he really wasn't given enough to do in my opinion.Whether or not Martin Scorsese will actually admit that his latest film, The Departed, is a remake of the Hong Kong thriller, Infernal Affairs, remains to be seen. I probably would have gotten a little bit more enjoyment out of The Departed had it actually been an original Scorsese film like Goodfellas or Casino, but this film pretty much follows the same exact plot as Infernal Affairs; beat for beat, up until the film's last minute twist ending which, no that I think about it actually does kind of make sense. Should you see The Departed in theaters? Yes, absolutely! Especially when you look at all the other amazingly craptastic movies playing in theaters right now you should definitely go out and see it, hell, see it just for the great performances; they alone are worth the price of admission. Actually the more and more I think about it, the more I love this movie. I'll definitely need to see it again, and if necessary again and again. I actually could see myself rating this one as a ten after multiple viewings.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the very best films I have ever watched.,"At first when they announced that Di Caprio was going to be the lead (or one of the lead) characters in The Departed, I was strongly against it. I hated the guy. I thought his acting was wooden at best and compared him to a poor man's Christian Bale. But after seeing him in this I have to change my view. He is outstanding, as is all of the cast, with exception of perhaps Martin Sheen who I think was perhaps miscast but still does a great job. But that's my only fault. This is Scorsese's masterpiece and I only hope that if they do make a sequel/prequel... that they don't bastardise what is truly a great film. The film has been called a shot-for-shot retelling of Infernal Affairs... but this doesn't begin to describe just how good this film is. Infernal Affairs is an amazing film, but The Departed takes the story to new places and does something that no film in the past five years has done... be re-watchable.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Scorsese gangster movie with a ""twist""","Great movie which unbelievably gets worse from about half way through all the way to it's unsatisfactory conclusion. It's so close to being a classic but a series of bumbling mistakes contribute to it's downfall. Flawless acting, very good but not perfect direction and okay editing are here to be seen when all should be of the same standard coming from these people. The romantic triangle is preposterous when it could have been acceptable as a professional relationship and a separate romantic one and it never really serves the story any purpose but the tying up of the story is where it's classic status is strangled. The individuals outcomes are fine but the manner in which they end there are nowhere near the way they should have been. If Mexican stand offs weren't so overused.....However, recommended viewing none the less as it is captivating even as the story heads downhill, perhaps a compliment very few movies in history can boast.

Quite Possibly the BEST Movie in 2 Years,"Let's get one thing straight, Martin Scorsese is a genius. Goodfellas, move over. Gritty, dramatic, suspenseful, all-around awesome. Everything was well acted. Great cast, though, anything with Nicholson is unbelievable. I can't say enough great things about this movie. The twisted nature of the story is what binds it together and keeps you begging for more. From the superb shots of Boston to Alec Baldwin's witty and hilarious lines. My favorite being to Matt Damon... ""You want a cigarette? What you don't smoke? What are you, a health nut? Alright, go f*ck yourself."" All done monotonously and dry. Just a superb move through and through, and though, it clocks in at 2 1/2 hours, the time seems to fly by as the story just draws you in deeper and deeper.

A great film on every level,"I saw this movie today with very high expectations. While I loved ""The Aviator,"" and moderately enjoyed ""The Gangs of New York,"" I was very excited to see Scorsesee doing what he does best; street-grit mobster movies. Of course, he did not invent the genre, but with this movie he proves that he has mastered it.Many others have described the plot, so I will not, only in saying that the plot is rather intricate, but it proves to be very rewarding and entertaining if you stay focused and glued to the screen, which is not hard when you're dealing with a top-notch cast that clearly enjoys the material. Leonardo DiCaprio proves that his brilliant performance in ""The Aviator"" was no fluke, as he shows a new level of depth in this role. Matt Damon is superb, but Jack Nicholson steals the show. His performance is in turns creepy, hilarious and realistically disturbing. Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg deliver fantastic supporting performances as well. Am I crazy in saying that Alec Baldwin is turning into one of my all-time favorite actors? His supporting roles in recent years have been simply incredible.Another aspect of this movie that I enjoyed was the humor. The dialogue was great, and some lines were just plain hilarious, funnier then most comedies. Go see this movie. Movies this amazing are becoming few and far between.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Gimme a Break!  ""The Departed"" is Pretty Good but Far From Great","""The Departed"" is a fairly entertaining movie, although about 2/3 through, it definitely drags. There is simply too much reliance on cell phones as if, ""Oh, wow, ain't it something the way we can call one another at any time and, gee, isn't Generation X really interesting to watch?"" The answer is a resounding NO! You get really tired of yet another ringing cell phone and another kid picking up and blabbing away as if it's so important and so ""heavy."" Leonardo DeCaprio gives an uneven performance as the undercover cop who has successfully infiltrated the Irish Mafia in Boston. He starts out well, especially when he is being taunted by his superiors who are hoping to recruit him for undercover work, but it becomes increasingly evident that he has copied the characterization effectively utilized by Johnny Depp for ""Donnie Brasco,"" a better movie about an undercover cop who has infiltrated the mafia. Even his facial expressions start to resemble too much those used by Depp. At times, his character does hit a sort of stride, but generally, the ride strains credulity. Were I the crime boss, I'd have greased this punk the first time I suspected he might be a rat, because his denials are unconvincing. However, his IS a likable performance, despite its limitations, and I especially liked his budding romance with the sexy young psychiatrist. Unfortunately, the buildup doesn't really deliver, save for an abbreviated sex scene, mostly because the plot doesn't allow it. DeCaprio's nemesis, Matt Damon, the gangster mole in the Boston PD, never gains our sympathy. This guy is a piece of sh*t, pure and simple, and you might expect that he had some redeeming qualities, which he does not. That he gets away with all his inside machinations and is never seriously suspected by anyone in power, once again, asks us to suspend disbelief a tad too much. Jack Nicholson, as the ruthless crime boss the mole often refers to simply as ""Dad,"" hands in a reasonable performance that has been referred to as ""absolutely amazing,"" which it simply isn't. There are one or two interesting moments, such as his imitation of ""the dirty rat gnawing at cheese,"" but he fails to convince us that he is evil personified or incredibly mean and scary. This Nicholson is definitely not as good as the crazy caretaker of ""The Shining,"" nor for that matter, the inspired bum of ""Ironweed."" He's pretty good in this movie, but not great, and definitely not as good as De Niro or Pacino in similar roles. In fact, certain of the gang members, especially his right-hand man, do a more effective job of exuding pure evil.This is not to say that ""The Departed"" is a bad film, only that it is clearly flawed. And the ending, jeez, it definitely IS surprising, I'll give it that, lending further credence to the idea that Scorcese wasn't really serious when he made this thing. It comes off as black comedy rather than the gruesome drama of his earlier efforts at portraying organized crime. But something about the ending, however startling, doesn't quite add up, if you think about if for a moment. With all the violence, one is almost tempted to push aside lingering doubts about several developments, but you won't get a chance to consider it until after the credits roll. The final scene sets things about as ""right"" as can be expected, but it's almost too neat and there is something unsettled here that all the hype can't sweep under the rug. If you can get in to see this flick for a discount price, it's probably worth it, because it is reasonably entertaining most of the time, otherwise, I'd advise you wait until it comes out on DVD.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
It is just a bad terrible Hollywood copy of IA.,"It is just a bad terrible Hollywood copy of IA. I can't believe how Hollywood treat the audience.

I am very very very disappointed, we can be more creative, this is very sad !!!!! I don't believe the screen play writer hadn't watched the original Infernal Affairs while writing the Departed screen play. I am sure everybody in the cast and of course the writer and Director had watched the Original for at least 10 times if not 100 times. The actors delivered the same exact emotions and writer and director just Americanized the story. Add some sex scene. Add few sub plots not related to the story and a happy resolution in the ending. Come on guys you can be a little more creative with 90 Million dollars budget. The other sad thing is how films are sold and marketed using actor names and not the story line. Infernal Affairs and Departed are great example of this. The Original Infernal Affairs when screened in US just made $89.6K, because in US there are very few people that watch anything made outside Hollywood.

Worth seeing twice,"I really liked this movie. A lot.Frequently when a movie with this much talent is put together, it seems like a lot of it gets drowned out by some other element of cinematography, but here, the film making process actually did what it was supposed to do--it acted as a supporting mechanism for the brilliant actors.I have to admit that the casting was superb. Leonardo did a great job... he really came through in the clutch with one of the most difficult acting jobs he could have been assigned. Likewise, Nicholson was AMAZING. He was the absolute perfect man for the role and he will leave you wanting to like him, but the whole time knowing he is the bad guy. Damon again does what he can with his rather bland personality, which happens to be perfect for this role... he was the right casting choice and fits into the movie perfectly.The two big surprise actors in this movie are Wahlberg and Baldwin. Both have minor roles, but are hilarious. Wahlberg especially. He provides the necessary comedic relief to make this movie feel like a dark comedy at some points rather than a drama. Also the Boston element really comes forth within this movie... there is a heavy emphasis on the Irishness of the town not seen since Boondock Saints.The character development that we see is really a major plus to this movie. Watching the characters change and suspicions arise does just as much for this movie as the action does.The reason that I didn't give it a ten is because the ending leaves a few questions that give the viewer a solid amount of confusion, and in a movie like this I feel like it would be best to answer those questions. However the ending is great--its shocking and brilliant and leaves the viewer with a deep satisfaction that most movies these days do not.This is the epitome of a good film, don't let this one pass you by.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Academy Award Winner of Best Picture for a reason,"When I went to see The Departed, I was left with a feeling I very rarely have after watching a movie. I usually either feel satisfaction or disappointment, but The Departed left me craving. I wanted more! I did not want the film to be over! There is never a dull moment in this film! I really do not care if some people feel it is a copy-cat film of the Chinease movie ""Internal Affairs"". I absolutely love this movie and I am glad so many people enjoy it as much as I do.Martin Scorsese is able to somehow grab a certain story from real life and just turn it into an unbelievably good movie. He does that here. He is able to take the terms and lifestyles used in an original historical Boston setting and incorporate them into this film. The story itself is terrific. It focuses on the part of two ""undercover"" agents working against each other! One is a police officer inside a Boston mob organization and one is a member of that organization inside the police force. The entire story sets up nicely and builds up to a huge climatic point where to put it simply, ""the $hit hits the fan!"" The filming of this movie is fantastic! Every scene looks perfect! There is plenty of action in this film and a lot of humor. There is never a point of boredom or uneasiness! The movie flows so perfectly that you can follow it easily! If I were to put this film into a genre, it would be a mixture of a comedy/action/drama/suspense/thriller.The casting in this movie is self-explanatory. Just look at the names; DiCaprio, Damon, Nicholson, Wahlberg, Winstone, M. Sheen, and Baldwin. Everyone plays their hearts out! DiCaprio and Damon are good in their two lead roles. Nicholson was up for an Oscar Nomination for his role which is fantastic! He plays the stylish and dangerous mob boss Frank Costello. Alec Baldwin is pretty darn funny, he plays the head of a special investigation unit of the police department! But the best actor in this film is without a doubt, Mark Wahlberg. He got an academy award nomination for best supporting actor for his character, Dignam! He stole every scene he was in! He was extremely funny and serious at the same time. A terrific performance on his part. All the actors in this film feed off of one another brilliantly. You can pick out the intensity they have when they are shooting this film. It is phenomenal! And although the actors do a great job in their roles, the characters created for them are perfect! Every character created for this film has an important part and they all do something memorable for this film. Everything about the actors and the characters in this film rocked!I love Martin Scorsese and I truly believe, in my own opinion, this is his best film. I know it is my favorite but I think it may also be his best. This film has everything a good movie needs! Yes, you can expect violence and a lot of vulgar language, but it is worth it! The vulgarity in my opinion only adds to the intensity of the film. I truly believe everyone should see this movie. It may seem long at 2 and half hours but it is worth it.

However, when Billy Costigan (Played by a surprisingly on-fire Dicaprio) goes undercover for the MPA, in order to infiltrate the Irish Mafia, both begin to smell a rat in each others organizations and things get tense and let it be said, violent.Superbly done, intelligent, cleverly-crafted dialog and a genuinely simple story with underlying complexities makes The Departed an intense, intriguing thriller, coupled with a fantastic cast makes this a personal favorite and no doubt the feeling is mutual amongst many others.Simply a must see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Pales next to the Hong Kong original,"THE DEPARTED is Scorsese's eagerly anticipated remake of the smash Hong Kong thriller, INFERNAL AFFAIRS, which captivated much of Asia and spawned two sequels across the Pacific. The casting of Nicholson, De Caprio et al looked promising.While there are some entertaining moments in DEPARTED and the film is enjoyable, it falls far short of INFERNAL AFFAIRS. Ironcally, IA feels more like a Scorsese film than DEPARTED: fast-cutting, a rock soundtrack, sharp camera moves and action jacked-up to 11. DEPARTED is inconsistent. At two-and-a-half hours, it moves, slows down, rocks, stops, goes forward, pauses.There's also a little too much posturing among all these cops and villains and not enough suspense which accelerated INFERNAL AFFAIRS like a rocket ship hurling into space. The central cat-and-mouse premise between the two moles is strangely muted in DEPARTED and that's what hurts the film the most.Performances are fine, starting with a salty Nicholson. I love Scorsese, but his hallmarks of slick camera moves, swift editing and the perfect soundtrack don't hit the mark.Not bad, but certainly not vintage Marty.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the 50 best movies of all time? Really??,"""The Departed"" isn't a bad movie, but it's certainly not one of the best movies ever made, yet as of this writing it is #49 on IMDb's Top 250-- a list which reveals far more about the reviewers than the films.One look at the Top 250 is enough to make any cineaste curse transient gods like Michael Bay and the Wachowskis. The list is so slanted toward movies that are both American and recent that a serious list of excluded movies-- from 1919's ""Broken Blossoms"" to 1939's ""Rules of the Game"" to 1959's ""400 Blows"" -- makes the Top 250 look downright silly. How silly? It includes the following, all of which have good qualities but nothing approaching best-ever levels: Inglourious Basterds, The Prestige, District 9, Kill Bill I, V for Vendetta, In Bruges, Benjamin Button, Big Fish, Crash, and an Eastwood quadruple-threat, Gran Torino, Changeling, Million Dollar Baby, and Mystic River. (News flash: Eastwood is as talented a director as he was an actor.)Ranking ""The Departed"" at #49 is particularly strange because it isn't even as good as the Hong Kong original, ""Infernal Affairs"" (2002), which lands at No. 249. (Foreign films take a real beating on this list, which is why I cite many non-American filmmakers here. The USA is, after all, only one of more than 150 countries producing movies.) ""The Departed"" at #49 is also odd because it's far from the best work of any of the actors-- Damon, DiCaprio, Nicholson, Winstone, Farmiga. (As for Oscar-nominee Marky Wahlberg, all I can ask is WTF. His apparent facial paralysis wasn't a particular handicap in his role as Sgt. Dignam, maybe that's why he was lauded. All he had to do was deliver profanities, but even at that Wahlberg is to R. Lee Ermey as Bud Lite is to Guinness Stout.)It's probably also true (for obvious reasons) that a lot of IMDb-ers have mainly seen movies made after they were born, and mainly American movies besides. No wonder they produce a list as lame as the Top 250. A lot of young people I know categorically dismiss black-and-white movies, which is probably a fair reflection of the number of idiotic fusspots in the world. But if you've never seen Gregg Toland's cinematography, how can you evaluate Wally Pfister's? One 20ish couple I know-- movie buffs who are well-read and savvy-- haven't even seen The Third Man or Grand Illusion or Rashomon, so I find it really impossible to take their uneducated opinions about film seriously. I also wonder if they really are fans. I don't see how they can be if they're not searching out Ozu and Leone and Lubitsch.Ultimately, IMDb's Top 250 is a good list if your teeth need grinding. As for the actual written reviews-- some of which are very very good-- the only profitable way I've found to read them is to customize them by eliminating all ratings of 1 and 10. Try it. It's an astonishingly effective filter because about half the reviewers don't seem to know that numbers 2 through 9 even exist. I just checked an unquestionably average-to-above-average film, ""Rushmore"": it had 592 comments-- and 452 (76%!) rated it 1 or 10.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"The best cop thriller since ""Goodfellas""","This movie is excellent. It is definitely the greatest movie of 2006 is one of the 5 best movies of the decade. Everything about it is good. The story is one of the best ever. The story is just amazing. The acting is also incredible by almost everybody that was in it. The script is also great. This is definitely The best cop movie since Goodfellas, or you can say the second best cop movie ever made. This is Scorcese's best job directing ever. He deserved to win for Goodfellas. This movie was definitely worthy of the Oscars that it won. It deserved to take home best picture, director, and screenplay. I am surprised that Leonardo DiCaprio wasn't even nominated for this. This was a great movie. Scorcese's second best. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One For The Ages,"It's quite evident anyone who knows anything about filmmaking, anything about cinema would logically put this in their top 10 or 15 of all time. We have two fine actors in the primest of primes in DiCaprio and Damon, and a lunatic Nicholson on the back nine of his career, giving us one of the most likable bad guys of all time. And a supporting cast that reads like Walhberg, Baldwin, Sheen, Winstone, etc. Scorsese delivers what he does best, a film about the mob and the fuzz, where we are somehow simultaneously rooting for every single character and yet we don't know why. Scorsese has the ability to make us fall in love with every character and every turn in the story for better or worse. He has me afraid of the opening of an elevator or apartment door for the rest of my days, but he also has me looking forward to his next project like none other.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
DiCaprio Performance was GREAT,"Wow Wow Wow. I just saw this movie and was blown away. I was on the edge of my seat for the 2 ½ long movie just waiting to see what would happen next. You can not tell the good guys from the bad or what will happen next. But what you can tell is everyone brought their A game to this movie. Everyone's performance were wonderful, from Alec Baldwin and Mark Walhbergs great line delivery, that let you laugh out loud when thing on the screen where getting to intense. To Martin Sheen and Jack Nicholson both letting you know who's in control. The of course Matt Damon who continues to surprise me about how good of an actor he is.But the person that really stands out for me was Leonardo DiCaprio as Billy Costigan. You feel his pain in every scene, you feel how alone he is, how frighten, and how freaked out his world is. You can almost feel his rapid heart beat. If you are not a Leo fan you will be after this. I highly recommend this movie for the great acting you get to see.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The master of crime movies is back!!,"When I heard that Martin Scorsese was making a new movie I didn't know what to think. He had made some superb movies such as Goodfellas, Raging Bull and Casino but recently he had made the Aviator which i thought was OK but nothing special. Also the fact that Leonardo DiCaprio was starring in it made me think that it wouldn't be all that great either as i had only seen 2 movies in which i thought he was good (Gangs of New York and the Beach). But then i heard the rest of the cast (Jack Nicholson..come on!!) and the plot (an urban crime saga) and i thought that Martin may very well make another classic. When the trailer came out i was blown away and couldn't wait to see. When i finally did get that chance i thought it was cinematic genius. a not too complicated storyline, great acting, well known actors and edge of your seat suspense. I'm not sure if this is as good as Goodfellas but Jesus Christ its as close as we'll ever get to ANY film topping Goodfellas....The master of crime movies is back!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Four Stars,"Jack Nicholson is widely known for playing characters like himself. The question for the audience of his latest film, The Departed, is, will you be watching his character or the grinning Nicholson we know and love? Veteran Director Martin Scorsese opens the film in a way that any speculation of whether Nicholson can pull off his nastiest role to date (his turn as The Joker in Batman comes close) vanishes on the spot. Scorsese shows Nicholson in shadows during the opening sequence, aided by The Rolling Stone's Gimme Shelter. Not until the audience has been truly sold that this is the brutal, malevolent, and immoral Frank Costello, does Nicholson's face reveal itself from under the shadows.The Departed, based on the Hong Kong thriller Infernal Affairs, carries some large star power. The director, Scorsese, is arguably one of the best working directors to date. The cast includes Leonardo DiCaprio as Billy Costigan, Matt Damon as Colin Sullivan, the aforementioned Nicholson as Frank Costello, with supporting roles by Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Vera Farmiga, Alec Baldwin, and Ray Winstone. Catch any wind of that list of names and any expectations of this film go sky high. Yet despite gargantuan expectations for a film that was rumored to have so much tension on its set, the movie succeeds on almost every level.First off, the screenplay by William Monohan is brilliant. The fast, often surprisingly hilarious dialogue is coupled with the gripping story of two informers, one infiltrating the Boston State Police (Damon) and the other the Irish Mafia (DiCaprio). Scorsese's stylistic direction and old film school techniques assisted by Michael Ballhaus's slick cinematography make the story flow smoothly yet surprisingly fast-paced for a two and a half hour movie.The acting is phenomenal all around. DiCaprio proves his skill to everyone who denied his talent, even after his award worthy role as Howard Hughes in The Aviator (his second pairing with Scorsese, the first being Gangs of New York). He truly gives a layered, emotional performance, and arguably his best. Matt Damon reminds us that he is still an extremely capable actor, yet his role feels overshadowed by DiCaprio's. Nicholson gives one of his best performances with his wild turn as Frank Costello. However, the very underrated Mark Wahlberg gives a scene stealing performance as Dignam, giving his best work to date. Just about every single word that comes out of his mouth is absolutely hilarious. Sheen also gives a surprisingly great supporting performance, as do Farmiga and Baldwin.The film is nearly perfect until a scene during its climax, where the action might appear over the top to some. But not to worry, the film's ultimate ending provides all the satisfaction one could hope for. The Departed is a remarkable film, proving that Martin Scorsese still has it after all these years, churning out what is possibly the best movie of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Better than ""Goodfellas"" Scorsese's best film.","I realize saying Martin Scorsese's best film is a very bold statement, considering his film history, but i still believe it to be true. Although movies like ""Raging Bull"" and ""Goodfellas"" are classics, and very very well made films, ""The Departed"" was incredible. From the amazing cast, to the perfect soundtrack, awesome editing, this movie had it all. I feel as if people value movies sometimes only upon there value to the industry, thats why people say ""It's no Goodfellas"" i believe it is! It could be i grew up about an hour away from Boston haha, but it's tremendous none the less. I suggest this film to any Scorsese fan, or any one looking to see one of the greatest films this year,great action, great suspense, great drama, sprinkled with comedy the whole way through. Spend the $9 bucks, get popcorn, haha enjoy this to the fullest, you won't regret it",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Not a ripoff but not a good remake!! Original was better!!,"This film is not a carbon copy ripoff, its a bad remake of the original. The story line was kept exactly the same...so much the same that the dialogue was kept the same...exactly the same. Basically anything Hollywood takes from other countries and tries to remake it..they do it badly. Whether its Japanese horror, Chinese action films or anything for that matter..they fail. Why cant they just promote the originals instead, since those who thought them up did a great job and a much better job than Hollywood can ever do. I'm not saying nothing good comes out of Hollywood...I've seen a lot of great films from Hollywood...just never one that was made better than those who thought of the original foreign version.

Not as good as people say,"I must say, I went into the cinema with high expectations (always a bad idea) and this film did not live up to them. It was ploddingly slow at times. Scorceze is one of those directors whom people loathe to criticise but I think he is also one of those directors who is beginning to believe his own hype. This movie takes time to overemphasise things which add nothing to the plot, such as the religious attachment of Matt Damon's corrupt character. Too much of the movie is reliant upon the charisma of the core actors, especially Nicholson. It almost feels lazy in it's direction.There are some very good performances. Leonardo Di Caprio is excellent, Jack Nicholson is charismatic. Matt Damon is OK.Other than being glaringly slow, there were not many problems with the movie. Some careful scene culling and it would probably have engaged me a lot more. Do not believe the hype nor all the ""this is the best ever"" comments from people here. Don't get me wrong, It is good. But it's nothing special. I prefer the Chinese original over this remake - even though I have to read the subtitles! The Departed lacks the flair of Gangs of New York, and lacks the cohesion of the original Internal Affairs.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

All the subtleties are lost by the poor dialogue.As you know, this movie is based of a hong kong made movie ""Infernal Affairs"". If you have the chance, watch that version.

It's an entertaining movie, no doubt, but it's definitely not up to par....",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Scorsese hits the jackpot..... again !!!,"The Departed is one of the best contemporary thrillers that I have seen. True its a remake, and critics will be be saying,""So what the Chinese did this before and even made sequel to it.."" But Scorsese's Departed is a whole new thing. Firstly Jack Nicholson.(Screw me, but I'm a big fan of him...) Even though Nicholson is the villain, the movie doesn't give him much of a headway. He starts off as a local absconder and rises up to a mafia boss, but throughout the movie he rules about every other actor. Be it DiCaprio or Damon. Even in the scene where he dies he commands an aura of respect. Second point making this a must see, is undoubtedly its marvelous star cast. True again that some of the actors were not used to their potential like Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg but still no one would be able to resist the temptation of such an unbelievable cast. Thirdly Martin Scorsese. The bloke has given Hollywood some amazing movies over the years. He may go down in history as the greatest director not to get a Academy Award(I cant see him bagging an award for this, since its a remake) but he truly is a genius. And lastly Pink Floyd. If you people are wondering if I have lost my nuts, then no. Indeed Floyd's most remarkable song,""Comfortably Numb"" does feature in the movie in the love making scene between DiCaprio's character and Vera Farmiga.No point harping about the story cause many people saw the smash hit, Infernal Affairs and its a clone of that. Every odd scene, leaving out the ending. The technical bits was good. Screenplay was solid, acting out of the world, there was some bits for comic relief. Some real cool stuff shown with cell phones. Matt Damon, DiCaprio and Martin Sheen all were very good. Vera Farmiga also looked good, even being a new face. Alec Baldwin was vastly underused, so was Mark Wahlberg. But end of the day Jack Nicholson owned the movie. He set the tone, and even at the age of 75, he commands such respect. The scene at the porn theater, I couldn't comprehend Nicholson enacting that masturbating drama, but he pulled it off. Its like a tug of war, with all the heavy weights on one side and the 75 year old man on the other. So bottom line Departed is one hell of a movie, a rated must see. 8/10 !!!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Martin Scorecese is finally liberated...,"There is not too much to say that hasn't been already said. Let me just add that with this movie, Scorcese has been liberated from the cultural obligation to make an EPIC movie. With this, he has been freed to just make a great MOVIE. There are no grand passion plays here. Just a damn good story.The ending was a little bit ruined for me because IMDb or Yahoo entertainment news or some other piece of fluff article spoiled it when they speculated on the possibility of making a sequel. Shame on them! Also, why does Scorcese have to include ""Gimme Shelter"" in all of his trailers and movies? I can just imagine him trying to include it in ""Kundun"" for crying out loud! Although with that one exception, the soundtrack was superb.This is Leo's best performance to date....clearly the most understated yet. It amazing to watch him get exponentially better and better with each and every role. All of Leo's past sins have been completely, 100% absolved at this point as far as I'm concerned.All in all, a superb and riveting movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
These comments are all good.,This was an excellent film. It has a full cast of amazing actors an amazing director and who ever else was involved in this film definitely deserves something for it. This film is a work of art and will be a talked about movie for years to come. The only thing this film needed was a lower rating so other people can see it and agree with how much of a good movie it is. If it had a lower rating then they would have made more money because it was a very big talked about movie so people would recommend it and people would go and see it. So i am going to give this movie a 10 out of 10 because everyone did there job to the best of their abilities if not better and it really paid off.

Excellent - but not as good as Infernal Affairs - SPOILERS,"***** Contains Spoilers ******The Departed takes the Hong Kong classic ""Infernal Affairs"" and moves it to Boston. Skipping yet another plot summary, I'll concentrate on strengths and weaknesses. The writing, directing, and acting is absolutely first rate. Scorscase has assembled a great cast. Unfortunately, Jack Nicholson ONCE AGAIN feels the need to do slapstick and face-muggings in many places where simple acting would have been better. Leo DiCaprio gives what may be his best performance to date - he's riveting as a man so deeply uncover that he's losing his way and losing his mind - thanks to the immense pressure he's under. Having said that, I must also say that Tony Leung's performance in the original was even better. Mr. Leung is probably the best actor in Asia and maybe anywhere. Matt Damon, Mark Wahlberg, and others also do exceptional work.My nit-pick is this: The thing that elevated ""Infernal Affairs"" to classic status was not only the intricate story (that is preserved in ""Departed"") but the emotional connection that the audience had with the main characters - even with subtitles. When Tony Leung's good cop went down, it was devastating. When Leo DiCaprio's good cop went down it too elicited gasps from the audience I was with. But it was immediately followed by several other shootings and by the end many audience members were engaging in nervous laughter at the over-the-top violence. There was so much violence in ""Departed"" that the each occurrence held very little meaning and very little emotion. In ""Infernal Affairs"" most of the violence evoked true feelings in the audience.I highly recommend ""Departed"" - its an excellent film - but rent the ""Infernal Affairs"" DVD - and watch it with subtitles - the dubbed version is crap.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Best of the Year!,"I must admit that I went into the viewing of the film expecting it to be only OK, something to view on a Saturday afternoon. I left the theater wanting to applaud. While the film isn't flawless, it has great acting, a well-written script and good direction. I was glued to my seat immediately. I was worried about Leonardo. Yes, he has a handful of good performances on his resume, but the bad choices outweigh the good ones. You never know if he will actually be able to nail the part. Within 5 minutes you knew he would nail this one. If he doesn't get Oscar and Golden Globe nominations something is wrong. This is one of his best performances. His intensity is honest to the character. This is his film. The rest of the cast is awesome. Jack is a little over the top, but the audience allows it. Matt is, well Matt. He knows how to play this character. Basically he offers nothing new from what he has given us in other roles. There is a hint of charisma in some earlier scenes, but for the most part he doing just enough to make the character believable. The supporting cast is great. The movie is well casted. I loved infusing actors who were actually from MA. The violence wasn't over the top. The story was excellent. These actors had a great script to work with and the direction makes this film a modern day classic. I am purchasing it as soon as it comes out on DVD.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Best Picture of 2006,"Matin Scorsese does it again in The Departed. Like his previous hits (Goodfellas and Casino), he takes movie making to the next level and when you don't think it could go any higher, he takes you there. The Departed is an intriguing story that revolves around Jack Nicholson's Frank Costello, an Irish mafia boss. He befriends Matt Damon's character Colin Sullivan, who eventually becomes a Massachusets State Police officer. Frank uses Colin to make sure his deals run smooth. On the other side of the law, Leo DiCaprio's character, Billy Costigan, goes undercover for the State Police and takes orders from Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg. 2+ hours of great film making ensues. I previously had thought that V For Vendetta would be a front runner for Best Picture but after seeing this film, there's no way I can see it win. Scorsese deserves a Best Director and Best Picture award while everyone else in the film, especially Leo DiCaprio, deserve huge amounts of attention for their acting. The story is fresh, intriguing and it keeps you on the edge of your seat and guessing. Finally, when you think you have it all figured out, you realize just how wrong you are. This film should and will go down in history.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"An honest, concise critique","Although this movie is not that bad, it is however, too overrated. The movie spans more than 2 hours, a lot of which are used to re-iterate irrelevant minute details that don't contribute much to character development, plot, or the general theme. The movie is plain in trying to create a complex story which basically is not all that complex..2 simple parts that cocoon the overall story. watch this movie and judge for yourself, but don't follow the general wave that gives this movie excessive credit where it does not deserve it. Think about it from a third party perspective for a minute..Would this movie be as highly acclaimed and rated if it wasn't directed by Martin Scorcese and starred A-list celebs? imagine a normal cast, I'm pretty sure this movie would be in the same rankings as the lethal weapon series.. 5-7 but definitely not top 250.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
An explosive crime-thriller! Could be the best movie of the year.,"Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) are two new Police Academy graduates who are trying to make it into the police department. However, Colin has been raised by the notorious Irish mafia crime-lord Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) and is only there to infiltrate the police dept. He makes it through the interview and becomes an employee of the unit whereas Billy is denied the same opportunity. Instead, Billy is offered to take an assignment as an undercover cop to infiltrate the mafia. But this is a very special assignment and only two police officers, Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) know that Billy is actually a cop.So, we have two men each working secretly for the other side and no one, except their bosses, knows their true identities. Soon, each side realizes that there is a mole in their unit and tries to uncover his identity. That's when things start to get tricky. As each party tries to inform their boss about the possible future actions of the other side, it turns into a dangerous game. Colin warns his boss Costello ahead of time because he knows about the operations of the police department and Billy tries to inform Oliver and Dignam about what Costello is up to.This is truly an excellent film that will keep you at the edge of your seat until the very end. The plot is very well-written and, despite the many twists and turns, it feels completely natural. I feel the need to say a few things about Leonardo DiCaprio. I have always liked his acting but his performance in this movie is truly magical. He has matured as an actor and he completely steals the show in this one. He is explosive! All the other actors are actually performing very well.I am not a big fan of remakes and this is a remake of an originally a 2002 Hong Kong movie, ""Mou gaan dou"" (see the name Siu Fai Mak in the writing credits; he is the screenplay writer for the original movie).

Sell-out!,"In a society where being rich and famous is everything, it's sad to see a former rebel succumb to his nation's core values. Martin Scorsese decided being a celebrity with all the material trappings were what mattered most to him, and dreadful films like Departed and Aviator are the result. Perhaps Mr. Scorsese can rationalize his admirable work on film restoration and figure he's doing his part for the greater good, but I'm not buying it. In fact, I no longer will see a film simply because Martin Scorsese is the director. I wish he and Mick Jagger would take their champagne and yes-men to France, and leave the film and music-making to more eager and less corporate fellows. Also, as much as I respect Roger Ebert's analysis and writings, I can not take seriously his review of a Scorsese film.

Far from departed for America's modern movie master,"For over two decades, Martin Scorsese captured the essence of the modern mafia and street-wise tough guys so distinctly and vividly that the very idea of anyone else trying to so seemed infeasible. With Mean Streets, Goodfellas, and Casino, Scorsese molded ugly, violent and unrepentant criminals into captivating and even likable characters that are impossible to forget. After going off the beaten path with past efforts Gangs of New York and The Aviator, the man most people (myseslf included) to be our greatest living filmmaker has returned to his roots with The Departed. Simply put, it's the best film of 2006, if not the last several years. From the first words, there's no mistake that Marty has crafted another masterpiece like only he can. Obscenely crackling dialogue, in-your-face blood and brutality and a soundtrack that hits all the right notes are only a few of the familiar fingerprints left in the reels by Mr. Scorsese. It's funny, it's startling, and it's spectacular. How good is it? This could very well be the work that finally gets Marty the Oscar gold that he should've gotten a few times by now. We'll have to wait a few more weeks to see if that happens, but it takes much less time to see that The Departed is a masterpiece of film-making from a director who has made a living out of creating them.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Departed: Long Awaited Satisfaction,"The Departed released this week, directed by Martin Scorsese, I am compelled to say is the best movie that I have seen in my generation. This is the type of movie that recalls to all cinema effectionados the true reasons why we loved film so much throughout the years. It for one made me realize once again what a real movie is and should be; and understand for the first time all the grizzle that the film industry has been feeding us from each season to the next. Fueled with all the big names of the industry,(I mean Jack Nicholson, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, and Mark Walberg); every actor's performance was an exquisitely wrapped, unexpected gift. Certainly Jack Nicholson's best role since The Shining or One Flew Over The Cookoo's Nest. I have always been an avid fan of Scorsese's, having fallowed his career from Mean Streets to the present. Like a fine wine, he as aged to perfection. With the wisdom and guidance of his absolute wizardry, he has molded DiCaprio into who may be one of the most well respected artists of our time. It only seems like yesterday I had seen DiCaprio in Basketball Diaries thinking that one day he would amount to great things. That is an understatement. The film opens the underbelly of organized crime, exposing the relationship between what society has deemed the good-guys and the bad-guys. In this world, painted in brilliant shades of black and white, the cat and mouse game that plays out is a symphony to be reckoned with. It all begins with the paralleled lives of two aspiring Boston State Police Force agents. One is the all American, blue blooded thru and thru and the other a hardened, agent reject with a broken past. Both are moles for opposing sides: the Police and the Irish Mafia; each violently struggling to reveal the other's identity. It is interesting to see how this one ends, so I will not give you any spoilers. You can see the trailer at the link posted below . I suppose the next step for me is to see the movie for which it is based, Infernal Affairs, a Hong Kong Gangster genre directed by Siu Fai Mak.

Scorsese Departs from the Norm,"Are you wondering what you should do with your Friday night? Well you have come to the right place to, this movie had it all from bloodshed to romance it told the story in a way that keeps you wanting more. This movie was an amazing, psychological thriller including nonstop action, and a love triangle, that would give most movies a run for their money. The Departed starts out with two Boston Police trainees, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), two very different men on opposite sides of the law. Colin Sullivan is best friends with South Boston's local mob boss, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), whom he has known since he was a child. However Bill Costigan, whose family has quite the criminal history, is suspected of being a dirty cop due to his family history. In actuality Colin Sullivan is the dirty cop. After Costigan is subjected to interrogation from his boss he finally gives in to the fact that he can never be a cop with his family being a bunch of criminals. His boss offers him the job of infiltrating Costello's gang and finding out the identity of the mole in the police force. At the same time Costigan has fallen in love with Sullivan's girlfriend, the police force's psychiatrist. This movie takes so many twists and turns but it is all worth seeing. But be cautioned this is not a movie to bring young children to, the movie is aptly rated, this movie contains gore, and foul language, therefore it is not for a younger audience. This star studded cast was sure to attract a few moviegoers, but who knew that it would be enough to give the director, Martin Scorsese his highest grossing movie to date. This movie also has a great soundtrack that is sure to attract the older audience, including tracks from the Rolling Stones, and Pink Floyd, but the soundtrack also includes newer tracks by the Dropkick Murphy's, which contributes to the Irish theme in the movie, because the Dropkick Murphy's are known for incorporating Irish undertones in their music. Overall this movie is quite amazing, it is the best movie I have seen in a very long time. This movie deserves a 10 stars out of 10 because of its originality and its amazing acting.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"An Endless, Terrible Mess","What has happened to Scorcese? This film is just plain bad on so many levels, from the dreadful lead actress, to the hackneyed and confusing and badly structured & written script. There are bells and whistles aplenty, but bad acting, verbose storytelling, and general filmic desperation are the salient aspects of this bad film. Scorcese deserves the Oscar for Mean Streets, Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, King of Comedy, Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, but if he wins one for this dreadful movie, well, that's Hollywood. It seems Scorcese has been in Hollywood too long and is trying to impress the suits by parodying his early work...",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Why does Hollywood need to copy good foreign films?,"The departed is a top movie that will be remembered for decades. It contains everything that a good movie of this genre needs to contain.I have to admit that this was a very good, memorable and exciting movie. And the cast is amazing, especially the role that jack Nicholson is playing- which will probably lead to his fourth academy award for best male actor.But still of all its positive sides I don't like the idea that Hollywood movies kind of ""steal"" other foreign scripts/movies and turn them to American movies. I don't know if many of you know that the departed is kind of a rip off from the marvelous Hong Kong movie Infernal affairs. It came out year 2002 and in my opinion it's even better then departed an obvious 10/10!! I like it better because it's exciting all through the movie, one of the reasons is because it's 50 minutes shorter.Okay, now to my point. All due respect for the departed as a movie, as I said before I like it a lot. But the thing that bothers me is why Hollywood movies have to take other foreign scripts and turn them so that it will be more suitable for an American public. And because they also use well known actors, this will be a far greater success at the box offices all around the world then the Hong Kong movie. I think that they kind of take the credit from Infernal affairs, and it will be Departed that will be remembered throughout movie history.I think that's wrong thing to do, instead I think they should broadcast and market the Hong Kong movie in America and all around the world. They should try to do something about it, for e.g. came up with new ideas, new scripts, instead of just changing a bit of the content. By doing this Infernal affairs would get the credit they deserve abroad and we could also maybe have a totally different and new film instead of the Departed with the same actors and director. I don't know if many people agree with me, but that is my opinion.Please comment what I have been writing here, would be glad if you did!",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

I was amazed!!!,"I think this movie is wonderful. It gives you info about a time you do not need to know, but is still real and important in an interesting way. I am Irish so I had a special passion for this film, but even if you are not you get sucked in. The acting is amazing. It is like a wonderful ice cream treat on a hot day and the cast is the cherry on top! This is a fascinating tale of two men who are doing the same thing just Leo Dicaprio is on the good side pretending to be bad and Matt Damond is a bad guy pretending to be good.

Cops and Robbers At It's Best!,"The twist and turns in this movie are unpredictable. But the plot, perfectly simple. This all adds up to a flawless emotionally packed who's-who crime drama with a bit of pulp to say the least. There is no one better to direct a crime drama, then Martin Scorsese. There's only one powerhouse director that could have pulled this cast of many superstars together, yet it not get in the way of the characters. You can't find a better cast! To top it all off, Scorsese once again merged music into film better than anyone, where the emotion of the music enhanced the image on screen. Having said that, and of course the soundtrack had to be a throwback to my favorite kind of music. As the classic rock soundtrack magically weaved itself from the beginning scene until the end, the cast of music stars seemed to echo the film stars. The music artists and song choices were if God came down to Scorsese and said that he has one list of songs that he can take with him to heaven. It absolutely hypnotized me. Ironically, the soundtrack gave the movie a modern or more perhaps shall I say timeless feel. I can't wait to see this movie again and again on DVD.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Departed - Professor Scorsese teaches us all a lesson,"If you think this is the usual blood and guts gangster movie, you will be wrong. But I do not think you will be disappointed. There is so much more to this movie as long as you can put up with fiendishly clever and excessive, blood, guts, swearing and downright beautiful acting, writing, direction, camera work in an incomparable style that will be hard to beat at the next Oscar awards.It's easy to say that the people going to this movie want to see at least one of the numerous famous actors. By far the best was Nicholson, but for the rest, everyone very nearly as great, they were nose to nose at the finish line. I want you to know that I have not been a big fan of the grown but still young brat pack, Dicaprio, Wahlberg and Damon, but I am now a believer and no one twisted my arm. Seriously, everyone in this movie performed extremely well. If you have something against ""blood and guts"" movies and decide not to go, the choice you make will deprive you of the best group performance I have seen in a long time. The acting is very stylistic and sometimes comically over-the-top. The writing and camera work will almost make the normal mystery buff drool for more.And now, for the master himself, Martin Scorsese. Bravo! The way you manipulated the characters, drained the Red Cross of every last drop of their reserve and yet managed to make the story so easy to follow despite its surprises was sheer genius. On top of that, this was an extremely fun movie to try to figure out. When I knew there was going to be a twist, I was surprised each time how you tricked me. I suspect Jack has taken you to the dark side. Good move! Great movie!!I do not give bloody movies a 10, so giving it an 8 of 10, you can see how nearly perfect this movie was.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Interesting, but certainly not Scorsese at his best","This film is based on the Chinese (Hong Kong) thriller ""Infernal Affairs"", which in my modest opinion was much better than Scorsese's version. Certainly the editing, the directing and the acting of The Departed are all more sophisticated and more spectacular than in the Chinese film, but they sometimes tend to outshine the plot, like people wearing dinner jackets at their children's birthday party. The Departed is basically the story of two police officers working as undercover agents: Leonardo DiCaprio (who is the good guy) infiltrates a criminal organisation run by Jack Nicholson (whose performance is sometimes too over the top to be credible), whereas Matt Damon (the bad guy) is a mole for that same criminal organisation but working inside the police headquarters. The characters, though generally well played, are therefore not exactly ""deep"", so the film basically focuses on the twists of the story line, which had to be adapted to American tastes: there had to be a bit of romance (which might as well have been left out, as it is not essential to the film), a few references to growing up in tough neighbourhoods, a lot more violence than is absolutely necessary, a scene where Chinese criminals try to buy technology to develop a nuclear bomb (the ""Iranian"" and ""Korean"" scare), etc. These new, extra elements make the film much longer than the original version, and the last hour is painfully long as viewers are treated to a succession of boring scenes that only delay the conclusion everyone is hoping for. Martin Scorsese directed his best films in the 70s and 80s (especially classics like Taxi Driver and Raging Bull), but his more recent works have been rather disappointing: Gangs of New York was a rambling mega production about two-dimensional characters settling their scores amid no story at all; The Aviator was another mega production without a real story; The Departed is yet another millionaire production with a stellar cast but badly in need of a good plot. Has Scorsese lost his touch? Or are some viewers just not as easily convinced by his work when there are much better films like The Queen, Pan's Labyrinth, Babel or Little Children around?",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Vastly Overrated.   Worst ""Good Film"" of 2006 POSSIBLE SPOILERS","Maratin Scorsese has been a fixture in Hollywood for decades and members of the Motion Picture Academy must have felt that they ""owed"" him this Oscar for being Martin Scorsese, certainly not for this film which has more phony elements in it than any movie in recent memory. True it has 3-1/2 high profile stars: Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson and Mark Wahlberg. Plus it has more violence than can be found anywhere outside a war zone and enough blood to fill your average blood bank. Scorsese has plowed this field before -- in ""Goodfellas,"" a vastly superior movie. Why didn't I like it? Because the plot is stuffed with unbelievable elements including a three way romance between Damon as a cop, DiCaprio as an undercover agent posing as a criminal and a police psychiatrist who is treating them both ???). As for Jack Nicholson, he is reprising previous roles as the Devil, this time in the person of a crime boss who is also -- get this -- an informant for the FBI. Damon is Nicholson's ""mole"" inside the police department and DiCaprio is the police department's mole inside Nicholson's organization. The question is who's going to find whom first and, eventually, after many (bloody) twists and turns, who gives a damn anyway? Scorsese has made more bad films than good ones but what the hell -- it's time to give him his Oscar. As for the principals, DiCaprio presents himself as a cool but tortured soul living a dangerous lie, Damon is Damon once again, and Nicholson is out there in front of the camera chewing the scenery as he is increasingly wont to do. Wahlberg does quite a decent job in a completely over-the-top role as an overseer in the under cover section of the police department. Martin Sheen distinguishes himself in this movie (as DiCaprio's ultimate boss) primarily because his character is almost believable and he's low key where everyone else is hamming it up big time. This movie is expensive trash and its success proves once again that you can't underestimate the taste of the American people (or of the Motion Picture Academy).",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The only one that can do what I do is me. Lot of people had to die for me to be me. You wanna be me?,"The Departed is directed by Martin Scorsese and written by William Monahan, Alan Mak and Felix Chong. It stars Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone, Vera Farmiga, Anthony Anderson, Mark Rolston and Alec Baldwin. Music is by Howard Shore and cinematography by Michael Ballhaus.An Irish gang in South Boston becomes aware there is a rat in their midst, whilst the police force has a mole to contend with - with each one trying to out each other before the other does...Martin Scorsese remakes Hong Kong thriller Infernal Affairs (2002) for the English speaking world, and promptly bagged his first Best Director Oscar in the process. It's a thrilling picture packed with suspense and edginess, a psychological gangster picture driven by two men leading double lives that is leading them to the abyss. When the violence comes it erupts in thunderous strokes, all while the narrative pulses with paranoia. There are some irksome contrivances, but with a uniformly strong set of turns from the cast, great musical accompaniments, and a director returning to gangster form, The Departed is a sure fire winner. 8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Scorsese's 'The Departed' a Masterful Crime Drama with Expertly Crafted Suspense and Superb Performances,"""The Departed (2006)"" is a masterful crime drama that skillfully weaves a complex web of deceit, corruption, and loyalty. Director Martin Scorsese delivers a captivating and suspenseful story, drawing exceptional performances from a star-studded cast. The film tells the story of two undercover agents, played brilliantly by Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon, who infiltrate opposite sides of the law in an attempt to bring down the Irish-American organized crime syndicate in Boston. The tension and suspense are palpable, with each character struggling to navigate the treacherous moral landscape of their respective roles. The film is expertly paced, with well-crafted action sequences and dramatic twists that keep the audience on the edge of their seats. The supporting cast, including Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, and Martin Sheen, are all excellent in their roles, bringing depth and complexity to their characters. The film's thematic exploration of loyalty, betrayal, and identity is thought-provoking and emotionally resonant. Overall, ""The Departed"" is a thrilling, intense, and expertly crafted crime drama that ranks among the best in its genre.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Camp With Guns,"It has taken me years to see this masterpiece of cinema again. I saw it in the Netherlands in the afterglow of both DiCaprio and Matt Damon being idolised by gay men. Even the poster showed them in a sort of twilight state with Jack Nicholson lurking in the shadows behind them. Seeing it again and unravelling who is the ' mole ' in the Boston police force still remains fascinating to watch, as if deliberately forgetting the end of ' Hamlet. ' I am half in love with Scorsese's work because of its blatant violence, its homosocial world and in ' The Departed ' I actually laughed out loud at the Grand Guignol camp of it all. Straight camp is very elusive in film, but when DiCaprio has a show off scene goading Jack Nicholson into a dizzying excess of words, and best of all DiCaprio's one longish scene with Damon I felt that this was the real thing. Changing sexes I imagined Barbara Stanwyck and Joan Crawford ready to verbally and literally get out their guns. And also for some inexplicable reason the sextet from Donizetti's ' Lucia di Lammermoor ' recurring several times, and even on Nicholson's phone. No spoilers but he is really a villain soaked in other's blood and it is delirious seeing him watch the Opera with two bored women beside him. This should not work but it does, and initially I was offended by the homophobic language coming out of Damon's mouth, and quite a barrage of it before the opening credit simply saying ' The Departed. ' I firmly believe this film will last until the end of cinema as we know it, and even then it could resurrect itself. It is quite simply a great exercise in bad language, astonishing set pieces, Catholicism and all sorts of ways that people can be killed. It gets you in the gut, and for as long as humanity is what it is there will always be an audience for it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Scorcese is Michaelangelo,"In my view, Martin Scorcese, like Michaelangelo, is a great artist and sculptor. His medium is film rather than stone, but he has a similar capacity to create memorable images. The Departed has proved thought-provoking and I greatly enjoyed the story elements dealing with the machinations, the double-crosses, etc. Scorcese's films, with their ferociously kinetic forwarding devices and no-explanations action sequences make violence incredibly seductive. For me, this is due to the chiaroscuro simplicity inherent in the characters that create it. There is no hand-wringing, no questioning. In Scorcese's filmed world, this is simply the way things are, the way things are done.This said, Scorcese's similarity to Michaelangelo extends to the fact that the man is brilliant at drawing male characters, but horribly deficient at rendering females. Michaelangelo's drawings and sculptures of women (when he did them at all) looked like men with breasts stapled onto their chests. The women in Scorcese's films aren't characters, they're plot devices and interruptions. He seems to use them to establish a quiet respite of a moment. The problem is that such respites are anathema to his style of film-making and so the women are relegated to the sidelines, except when they get trotted out to forward a specific plot device. By and large, the women are never as vital, as supercharged, as fascinating and charismatic as the men. Instead, they're usually passive leeches who are there to be sexual vessels, doormats or harpies. Like the Catholic Church and old school Police Departments, Scorcese's films are a clubhouse that says ""NO GIRLZ ALLOWED"". Most of the times I have come away from seeing a Scorcese film with equal measures of admiration, resentment and sadness. If only Martin Scorcese could make a movie where his female characters were as cool, as fascinating as the men. Alas, I don't ever see this happening and it is a true pity that an artist as great as Mr. Scorcese should have this regrettable, glaring lack.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Best So Far For 2006,"My first thoughts walking out of the theater were, ""wow that was great but it wasn't as good as Goodfellas."" Few living directors have such built in levels of expectations as Martin Scorsese; his past will always be difficult to live down but he mostly does an amazing job with his all-star cast in The Departed. Given access to Hollywood's greatest talent allows him to create a vividly interesting and intensely watchable crime film. Everyone will have their favorites but for my money Alec Baldwin in the most consistently entertaining even with limited screen time.The film is long, but doesn't seem long. If you are weighing the film from an investment standpoint I doubt that there are many places that you can go for two and a half hours and be this enthralled for only about eight bucks.Back to The Goodfellas comparison. One of the reasons that that film had such a visceral appeal was that Ray Liotta was pretty much an unknown at the time. We got to know Liotta as Henry Hill, we didn't have many previous roles to work through in our establishing empathy. Sure he played in Field Of Dreams, but it was a brief appearance. In The Departed we never feel the same level of cathartic involvement because the actors are still just actors.In the end this is but a minor quibble as the action is so riveting, the performances so well presented and the story so engaging that it doesn't matter much that we don't have that same level of emotional involvement.Oscar time for Marty? Who knows. Most thought that the breakthrough would come with The Aviator (A great historical-visual masterpiece) but it was not the case. If the opening weekend means anything this will be probably be the director's most successful box office creation. Maybe that has been the real barrier to Scorsese getting over the top. While the violence is certainly ever present it seems to be less violent of a film than Taxi Driver or Goodfellas because of the way the violence is presented on the screen. It just sort of happens and it's happening just fits into the way that the plot unfolds.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Best movie I've seen in 20 years,"I caught this on DVD last night. The rest of the family was asleep while I sat in living room, slowly moving from chair to chair to get closer to the TV. This movie grabbed me and pulled me in hard. It had everything that I like in a movie. It had suspense, characters (that I care about and ones I hate), unpredictable, twists and a great ending.The movie basically is the story of two police officers coming out of the academy. One was sent there to be a spy for the mob (Damon), the other is recruited right away to be a mole in the mob for the cops DiCaprio). We watch as each reported to there boss's and tries to not get caught. Meanwhile a lot of people die around them (the departed).The suspense in this movie was so high I couldn't stand it. I sit here at work the next day and I'm amazed at how much I'm still thinking about it. The reason the suspense is great is two fold. One you feel like these characters (all of them) are in danger, real danger. Two you don't know what's going to happen next. All this makes for a great ride.I highly recommend this movie unless you don't like mob movies. This is very much a mob movie. 10/10BTW DiCaprio got robbed for not getting an Oscar nomination. I really don't care for the guy, but he did a hell of a good job. Walberg deserved his nomination. Damon was good but played it a little too cold. Nicholson, Sheen and Baldwin were great stars willing to play their parts to the hilt as supporting actors. If Martin Scorsese had not gotten the Best Director then the Oscars would have lost ALL credibility.Good Day!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Original.,"The Departed has some good actors and even better acting.

And it doesn't go overboard with the dialogue. With the exception of some parts, it was evened out nicely. I won't give it away but the ending in particular stood out most for me because it wasn't happy or sad. It was just an ending. A very original movie by Scorsese.

''give me that Oscar'',"As Martin Scorsese collected the Best Director Oscar for The Departed he jokingly began his speech by asking 'Could you check the envelope again??' This came after an extended show of respect from the crowd for a man who should have walked those steps many years ago. It is a fact of life that you aren't going to win every time. But to not win at all with movies like Taxi Driver, Casino, and especially Goodfellas, well, thats just an injustice. As his name was called out it seemed a collective sigh of relief swept over the film industry as finally the man who has battled long and hard collected his award.Scorsese stepped outside his gangster film making home last time out to tackle the biopic with 'The Aviator', with mixed reviews. Although not a bad film, it wasn't the Scorsese we've come to know, and it was time to get back to basics in the search for that elusive Oscar.'The Departed' tells the story of two men from opposite sides of the law ,undercover within the Massachusetts State Police and the Irish mafia. The State Police's aim, led by Detectives Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) and Queenan (Martin Sheen), is to take down Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), who has been terrorising the City for years. Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), is assigned the unattractive role of going undercover in attempt to do so. Costello's hand is made up of Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), who is his mole in the Police Department. To add to the tension, both Sullivan and Costigan fall for the same girl, shrink Madolyn (Vera Farmiga). The story is as intriguing as it gets, and the acting is superb on all corners, including the terrific Alec Baldwin.Jack Nicholson is immense, DiCaprios improvement away from the bay faced actor continues, and Damon is one of the best actors around full stop. My only annoyance is that Robert De Niro, a man who has forged a great partnership with Scorsese over the years, didn't feature in the film that finally got the great man an Oscar.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Scorsese proves why he's America's best living filmmaker,"Today I went to see a movie, I really didn't start hearing about until the past few weeks. While the internet has been the cause for much time away from my family, I never really seek out movie info, part of me still likes the surprise of seeing trailers at the theater, but I also have adopted a ""I'll see it when I believe it"" attitude when it comes to movies in the works. I have other things to do than bad mouth movies that have not even come out yet... with that being said....I went to see the latest Martin Scorsese film ""The Departed"". First of all ""Goodfellas"" is easily the top 2 of my favorite films of ALL TIME (right up there with ""Empire Strikes Back""). I have seen ""Goodfellas"" easily over 20 times in it's entirety. I am in the camp that believes that Martin was robbed of the Oscar in 1990, by Kevin Costner and his ""Dances with Wolves"". Don't get me wrong ""Dances"" was a good film, but I really think that for me it lacked the emotional journey and overall power that ""Goodfellas"" had. GF is film-making at it's best and honestly ""The Departed"" is like a breath of fresh air that's missing from so many big Hollywood films. Like many, I believe that Scorsese is arguably the best American director still alive today. Admitingly I was not a huge fan of the ""Avaitor"", and while ""Gangs of New York"" had it's flaws, it was still an enjoyable film. Of course films like Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, and Mean Streets stand on their own through the test of time.The film centers around Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) who is an undercover cop working inside Frank Costello's (Nicholson) gang and Colin Sullivan (Damon) who plays a cop working as a spy for Costello and his crew, keeping the Boston police off his tail.What follows for the next 2 and a half hours is an intricate crime drama with richly developed characters and an often vulgar, blood soaked story that will have you fully enthralled for the duration of the film.I don't want to spend all this time discussing the plot, I don't want to be put in the position of spoilers and giving away the best parts of the film. I am here to say that this is easily the front runner for the best film of 2006. Scorsese returns to his mobster roots and does not miss a beat. For a Scorsese fan all his signatures are there, from a soundtrack that could not relate better to the images on screen, to the brutality of the violence... This is no cheesy WWE John Cena film, this is a raw, bloody ""R"" rated movie for all the right reasons. This combined with the Boston setting make this a choice film for this boring time of yawn inducing October releases.The cast is suburb, Damon, DiCaprio, Nicholson are all equally amazing. Nicholson especially pitch perfect as Frank Costello, the aging crime lord that gets the sense there is a cop in his crew. Matt Damon is also amazing as the prick dirty cop working for Costello keeping him out of harms way. DiCaprio of course proves why he is worth every penny and this role really solidifies that he is the real deal. On a side note I find it funny that Ben Affleck gets tons of press, but has been in only one good movie (""Chasing Amy""), but friend Damon, has not only been getting quality roles, but roles that make money as well.While these are the key players, they take nothing away from an amazing supporting cast including Alec Baldwin, Mark Walberg and Martin Sheen, all do an amazing job in bringing very complex, unforgettable characters to blistering life.Worth a second, and third viewing, just to watch the acting alone, but also to really immerse yourself in the complex world of cops and criminals.Highly recommended, and worth every penny. This holds up as a very good reason than great movies can still be made. It's just sad that there are not more movies that are of this quality.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Good, but not as good as original.","Simple. Infernal Affairs(the film that this was adapted from) does a better job executing the story in 90 minutes then this does in 150. The screenwriters/adapters(which i believe Paul haggis might be involved) felt that inserting the word ""f-u-c-k"" about 750 times provided realism. In fact all it did was make the dialog more ridiculous. Infernal affairs stuck to its through-lines, whereas in this film the through-lines are more like short outbursts that are supposed to make you go ""ohhhhh i got it now"". Do not get me wrong, Jack, Leo, and Mark have exquisite performances. But Andy Lau's performance in Infernal Affairs blows Matt Damon's out of the water. The adaptation to Boston is good, the performances are good, the direction is good, but it is not great. And that is what one must look at when rating film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Scorsese proves himself once again,"**Contains spoilers** The departed is a great cop thriller that works on every level. Scorsese's direction is amazing proving once again he is one of the greatest directors. The editing is also great. The movie paces very well, and there are some very nice cuts that editor Thelma Schoonmaker uses. The story is great and has a lot of twist and turns that you don't expect (even though I still can't understand why Costello doesn't try to find the rat the old fashioned way and has to gather everyone's records in an envelope). The dialog is also great and fun especially from Mark Wahlberg who has a lot of nice one-liners. He also gives a good performance even though I didn't really like him as an actor. The performances are amazing from everyone. Jack Nicholson, may be a bit over the top but Scorsese knows how to control him. DiCaprio is amazing and proves again his acting talents. He is on the verge of mental collapse and has violent outbursts and DiCaprio seems like he's living his situation not acting it. Matt Damon is also great as the corrupt and sleazy cop and is the perfect actor to play DiCaprio's mirror character (the rat in the police-DiCaprio is the rat in Costello's gang). Vera Farminga does an excellent job as the only female character and Scorsese did well not to choose a famous movie star, and Martin Sheen is great as the head of the head for the investigation against Costello and I was really shocked when he was thrown out of the building. Which brings me to the ending. Though I was a bit annoyed about the way everybody got shot in the head, after I thought about it a little I realized that there wasn't any other way to end the movie. By killing all the 'rats' (Costello is the rat of his own gang to the FBI, DiCaprio is the rat in Costello's gang, Matt Damon is the rat in the police), Scorsese gives a message that betrayers will get what they deserve and makes the film theme of trust and betrayal even stronger. Now to see Infernal Affairs and compare the two!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
'The Departed' is what all those critics have been waiting for,"When you read reviews of Martin Scorsese's films from the past sixteen years, you'll notice a sense of disappointment with the films, as the critics usually express a dissatisfaction with the main character - arguing that whatever film they're reviewing lacks in comparison to Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Mean Streets, etc. Frankly, I loved Cape Fear, Casino, Bringing out the Dead, Gangs of New York and the Aviator. They are all, in their own ways, unbelievable tour de forces that left me shaking by tail credits. I'm even coming around on Kundun. I usually hate the day a new Scorsese movie opens, because I'm flooded with reviews from critics who are chiding that they weren't graced with another Jake LaMotta. With this movie, they seemed to find the pill easier to swallow, and it's easy to see why. It's bloody, it has a cast full of a-listers, a plot that's been around so long every kink has been ironed out, and Jack Nicholson, who deserves a few more awards for his turn as Frank Costello. I haven't had this much fun watching him since As Good as it Gets - but this time, it's a bit of a guilty pleasure. He is funny, frightening and pathetic all at the same time, a character so large he practically jumps off the screen. But of course, when you watch a Scorsese film, you're watching actors who are willing to take amazing risks because they trust the man at the helm - everyone in this movie gives the performance of their life. So, I was happy yesterday to read the positive reviews in all the trades and papers. Finally, people are starting to ease up on the guy a little. Not every film is Raging Bull, and that suits me just fine. This movie has everything for a Scorsese fan - melancholic main characters, a hint of religious undertone, blood, rock and roll, Thelma Schoonmaker, Michael Ballhaus, and a third act that really gets the blood rate up. I loved it so much, I'll see it again tomorrow.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Great film,"I finally saw this film the other day on DVD - for some reason I never got round to seeing it at the cinema...and I loved it.A smart, cat and mouse script, where the mice are both cats and the cats are both mice...a wonderful ensemble cast...and catchy, fast direction.Scorsese is often a director whom I admire far, far more than I enjoy - it's impossible not to be blown away by the styling and look of Taxi Driver and Raging Bull etc, but I can't say that watching them gives me a great deal of pleasure. Strangely, it's when he steps away from that iconic style that I love his films, rather than appreciating them in some distanced aesthetic sense.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Dazzling character study from a master filmmaker,"Without a doubt this is the best film of 2006. The deceptively simple premise involves the Massachussets State Police planting an undercover operative (Leonardo DiCaprio) in the South Boston underworld in order to take down Irish mob kingpin Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). However, Costello has a mole of his own....What unfolds is an absolutely stunning examination of the nature of violence, loyalty, avarice, and betrayal. The ensemble cast are uniformly excellent though Martin Sheen and a caustic Mark Wahlberg absolutely steal the show in their supporting roles as DiCaprio's world-weary handlers. Big Bad Jack turns in a bone-chilling, high octane performance that simply lights up the screen. As a side-note, his character is based in part on the exploits of a real-life South Boston mobster, Whitey Bulger.The razor-sharp dialogue is enthralling and Martin Scorsese's direction is flawless.

Scorsese can go straight to...,"...the editing room. That's right. Another example of modern film-making's inability to tell a story in a reasonable amount of time. Much like Peter Jackson's bloated ""King Kong"", Scorsese's remake of another classic would have benefited from a good chopping of 30 minutes' worth of film.Oh sure, Jack Nicholson steals another film with his performance. Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg didn't have to go to school to learn their Boston accents, which probably saved the producers a few dollars. I didn't see the purpose of the tug-of-war between Damon and DiCaprio's characters for the female love interest...it contributed absolutely nothing to the plot.In general, the performances were good, the bloodletting and violence were more than adequate to satiate contemporary film audiences. Overall, I'd call ""The Departed"" another big-screen exercise in tedium. Might as well go and see it. At least it's better than having a root canal without anesthesia.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Scorcese ceases to score,"Do not be deceived by favorable reviews.This is a bad movie from a director who has long ago lost his edge.It is a naked king's clothes, the Jonestown cool-aid, an Iraqi WMD, Iranian uranium for peaceful purposes only...all hype, no substance.A suicidal Scorsese confided in friends in 1980 that Raging Bull would be his last great film; he was not far off. King of Comedy was great. In a vacuum, Goodfellas was also exceptional...but, if you think Goodfellas was on par with Scorecese's 1970s triumphs then you should watch (or re-watch) Mean Streets, Who's that Knocking at my Door, and Italianamerican. Goodfellas is a big budgeted, sleek production that rehashes these earlier classics.Which leads us to The Departed.What is wrong with Scorsese? Has he developed dementia? Does he have permanent writer's block? Has his obsessive-compulsive disorder gotten the best of him, again? Why has he lost the precious ability to be artistic and original?In The Departed, the best Scorsese can do is abscond core themes from other great movies faster than Winona Ryder can stuff away apparel at Saks.The Departed, itself a remake of a recognized foreign classic (Marty, didn't you learn anything from Cape Fear?), grabs from far better films likeReservoir Dogs (e.g., the rat/informer)Donnie Brosco (e.g., the undercover cop in too deep)Mystic River (e.g., the gritty & violent underbelly of Boston)See these excellent movies and identify others that Scorsese has rubbed his dirty hands all over.Hey Marty, my version of The Departed has the Tigers' Kenny Rogers shaking your hand and leaving with enough smudge to pitch a few good ones, (at least until Tony LaRussa gets a look).",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Amazing,"In simple words this movie is just what it takes one man to see beyond entertainment. Though my favorite actor has always been Tom Hanks, recently when I watched Leonardo's 'The Departed' & 'Blood Diamond', I can say one thing he (Leonardo Di Caprio) has really evolved as a great actor. His performance has evolved beyond doubt if one has already seen his other movies like 'Gangs of New York', 'Titanic', 'Romeo + Juliet'.'The Departed' has a good storyline and gives an everlasting impact on the viewers. It really has been successful to portray the risk involved for men working as under cover police. This movie has everything that viewers can ask for 'action' and tons of 'thrills'.

I thought that movie was great. 2 1/2 hours of pure entertainment. Then we can down the whole list of his Oscar nominated movies. What was the movie he lost to when he was up for Raging Bull?

25 years in the making...and worth the wait,"In 1981, Martin Scorsese was nominated in the Best Director category for Raging Bull. That he didn't win then was criminal, that it took 25 years for him to get his hands on an Academy award is simply felonious. And so it is perhaps apt that it was The Departed that won it, being arguably his best crime picture to date.I have just re-watched the epic on DVD, after being blown away in the cinema, and I was struck again by the level of humour it boasts. The film is a masterpiece, as good in my opinion as Goodfellas, Casino or Taxi Driver - if not directly comparable - and a welcome return to form after the trudging blockbusters that were Gangs of New York and The Aviator.'The Departed', as a title, works on many levels. It refers literally to the numerous deaths in the film, but also reminds us how far 'departed' the main characters of Billy Costigan and Colin Sullivan have become from their original selves.Costigan (Leonardo di Caprio) and Sullivan (Matt Damon) are, respectively, a cop from the wrong side of the tracks and a choirboy turned crook, acting undercover in each other's organisations. Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) is the mob boss, and Martin Sheen plays Captain Queenan, ably aided by the excellent Mark Wahlberg as Sergeant Dignam.I could eulogise at length about how much I enjoyed this picture, or explore some of the many themes, from the many religious connections (Nicholson as Costello is the devil incarnate for sure) to the clear juxtaposition of the lives of Costigan and Sullivan (e.g. when the latter is buying a flat or having a date, the former is in jail or in a fight), but instead I would like to focus on the humour.Productions of this ilk, (and by ilk I include the likes of Donnie Brasco, Pulp Fiction, Goodfellas or The Sopranos), generally succeed where others fail because of the human side to the story. It's all very well having a killer plot, plenty of violence and lots of gangster patter, but if people can't relate to the characters it is unlikely to engage them.Think of the most memorable scenes from the afore-mentioned films and in your list is likely to be Joe Pesci asking ""What do you mean I'm funny?"" in Goodfellas, Johnny Depp explaining what ""Forget about it"" means in Donnie Brasco, ""Royale with Cheese"" from Pulp Fiction or any number of one-liners in The Sopranos. These jokes, while they would never bring the house down, remind you that these are real people rather than just killers, gangsters or crooks.And the Departed delivers as well as any of these, whether it's Dignam's insults: ""My theory on Feds is that they're like mushrooms, feed 'em sh*t and keep 'em in the dark"" and ""I'm the guy who does his job. You must be the other guy""; Captain Ellerby's quick-patter: ""I'm gonna go have a smoke right now. You want a smoke? You don't smoke, do ya, right? What are ya, one of those fitness freaks, huh? Go f*ck yourself""; or Costello's big-talk: ""One of us had to die. With me, it tends to be the other guy."" This aspect of the film kept me engaged, and meant that I was alert enough to the action to spot other subtleties, such as the references to ""Psycho"" and ""The Third Man"" in the shower scene and at Billy's funeral. One reference though, also I feel the film's weakest point, was more rammed down my throat than slipped into my subconscious. This came right at the end of the film, where the ""rat"" runs across Sullivan's window. A little too literal I thought.I probably wouldn't have remembered that had it not been the last scene of the film, and that aside, this is easily the best film I have seen in the cinema in the last decade. It certainly deserves to become in time a classic to be mentioned in the same breath as Scorsese's finest and is fitting to be the one that finally earned him an Oscar, after 26 years of being a bridesmaid.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"The Departed, go ahead and depart..please!","Not a terrible movie, but WAY overrated. Ridiculous dialog, predictable, and scenes that run on forever. Jack Nicholson overacts to such a degree that I laughed at several scenes that were supposed to be dramatic. And if I were the Boston State Police, I'd be furious at the depiction of unprofessional, irrational behavior exhibited by the central characters. Damon is a terrific actor, but seemed oddly miscast as a corrupt cop. I actually think Wahlberg would have been better as the morally bankrupt cop and Damon would have been better as the good cop with the anger management problem. So, not a bad movie, but I was terribly disappointed based upon the reviews and ratings listed here.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Fails to provide genuine emotional satisfaction,"Based on the popular Hong Kong action thriller Infernal Affairs, Martin Scorsese's The Departed has kinetic energy, an outstanding ensemble cast, a world-class director, and tense non-stop action but ultimately fails to provide genuine emotional satisfaction. Scorsese, whose Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and Goodfellas are classics of the genre, has come up with another gritty urban drama but, unlike his earlier efforts, it is filled with casual, ""cartoonish"" killing and a point of view that the excesses of organized crime and law enforcement are virtually indistinguishable. In an environment that does not distinguish between ends and means, there is no one to root for and those that do find a character to cheer for are begging for disappointment.Set in the mean streets of South Boston, The Departed is the story of an undercover cop (Leonardo DiCaprio) planted in the Costello crime syndicate and a mole (Matt Damon) who infiltrates the police force, pretending to be a cop. The film comes out of the gate roaring with the Rolling Stones Gimme Shelter providing the background to a street fight. The first Irish Mafioso we meet is Frank Costello, played by Jack Nicholson. In a flashback, Costello recruits a youngster named Colin Sullivan by buying groceries for his family. Later, Sullivan goes to work for Costello when he becomes a detective sergeant in the police force. Unfortunately, Mr. Nicholson performance is so over-the-top that we are all too conscious that we are watching Jack Nicholson, the actor not Frank Costello, the mob kingpin.Sullivan is played by Matt Damon as a one-dimensional Southie character just out of Good Will Hunting (I was half expecting Ben Affleck to wander into the scene with the rest of his drinking buddies). Sullivan's superiors are devout Catholic Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Sergeant Dignam in an Oscar-nominated performance by Mark Wahlberg. Dignam has the most quotable lines in the film, but his character is so foul-mouthed and antagonistic that he soon becomes tiresome. The most accomplished performance in the film is that of Leonardo DiCaprio as Billy Costigan, a tough but sensitive undercover cop who comes from a family with a criminal background and fits into the Costello organization but has to swallow Valium just to stay on an even keel.There is some love interest in the film as well. Both Billy and Colin fall for the police mental health counselor Madolyn (Vera Farmiga). Ms Farmiga does a creditable job but her part is so underwritten that it feels extraneous. Both Costello and the police soon discover that they have a rat in their midst and Sullivan and Costigan are assigned the job of finding the fink. As the noose tightens, both men desperately strive to avoid detection and there is lots of action as the dead bodies pile up.The Departed is a finely crafted film, excellently photographed by Michael Ballhaus and for the most part very well acted. Unfortunately, the plot is very thin and there is little character development or seriousness of purpose. While Scorsese should be acknowledged for telling the truth about the thin line between criminals and the law, the ending is so downbeat that it leaves us wondering what point other than futility the film is trying to make. During two and one-half hours of gratuitous violence, betrayals, double-crosses, and one-note characters, the departed may include members of the exhausted audience.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Scorsese Does It Again!!!,"Certainly Martin Scorsese is in the Top 5 film Director's of all time! His ability to put out movie after movie with astonishing screenplays and unforgettable characters is unlike any other. The Departed is an amazing film, from its acting, to its script, to its portrayal of the Boston police and the Irish mafia, and to its shocking finale.ACTING: The acting in the film is superb. At first it's awkward with everyone having Irish accents and such but you learn to love it. Like all of Scorsese's pictures, The Departed is extremely well cast. Leonardo DiCaprio is a fine actor indeed and may very well merit another Oscar nomination for his roll as an undercover in the Irish Mob, but nothing is certain with the Oscars. Mel Gibson wasn't even nominated for playing William Wallace in Braveheart, even though Nicolas Cage was more than deserving of his well earned Oscar for Leaving Las Vegas. Anyways back to The Departed. Matt Damon also delivers a strong role and possibly the best performance of his career. Is it just me or does Scorsese bring out the best in people? Everyone is already quite aware of Jack Nicholson's quality as an actor so I'll only say one thing. The personality he gives in his role as a criminal is surreal. There are still 3 actors who must be noted for making The Departed all that it is. Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg, and Alec Baldwin. Each of them giving unforgettable performances. They really stand out in the film and provide some humorous comments as well.STORY: From writer William Monahan (Kingdom of Heaven and soon to be Jurassic Park IV) comes an engaging, thrilling, and powerful story about corruption within the Boston Police and its ties with the Irish Mafia. Two moles, one within the police force tipping off the mafia, and one with the mafia tipping off the police force play a frustrating game of cat and mouse to discover each other's identities. That's the basic story line. Throw in a little drama, some very entertaining dialogue, a couple gun fights, and a few well placed twists and turns and you've just seen The Departed. Do all of Scorsese's movies have great screenplays or is it just me?OVERALL: The Departed is a must see and will hopefully win at least a few Oscars this upcoming year. With a runtime of about 2 and 1/2 hours it keeps you engaged the entire time. It's basically rated R for language, a little sexuality, and some traditional Scorsese violence. Great acting, cinematography, screenplay, musical score pieced together nicely, and direction make The Departed an astonishing film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Scorsese's best film????? for the Oscars yes, for me no but....","Is difficult to say what is the best film of Marty, in my opinion there are three films: Taxi Driver, Goodfellas and Raging Bull, maybe Gangs of NY, Casino and The Departed also, but in my opinion the first three are the best. Well about The Departed: this film is one of my favorite films of the 2006, with a great performance by Dicaprio and by Jack Nicholson and of course a great history about mafia, corruption and cops. I have seen this film like three times and every time i found a lot of news things and i think that is why this film is a masterpiece but for me is not the best of Marty.And of course we have to give some credit to ""Infernal Affairs"" in which this film was based and that is also a great film.About that this film won the best picture Oscar: for me the prizes are not important, because the art of a movie can't be compared with others, and for me the Oscar or the golden palm or all the other prizes are not important because when a movie is excellent, it is excellent with or without prizes.... but is a shame that a lot of people don't think that because they only see The Departed ( or whatever film) because The Departed won an Oscar. That is a shame but is true that a lot of people only watch film because some others say that is a good film ( like the jury of the Oscars), but well thats my opinion.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Deserving of every accolade it received.  The rebirth of gangster film.,"I'm not going to pull any punches here. 'The Departed' is the definition of a crime/thriller. Any fan of Martin Scorsese, Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Wahlberg, and gangster films will absolutely love 'The Departed', which deserves to go down as one of the best films of the last 25 years, if not of all time. It is near perfect in every aspect of film making, and is a non-stop, heart pounding, gripping, and brilliant thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat wanting more.Gang lord Frank Costello (3-Time Oscar Winner Jack Nicholson) is practically the most feared man in all of Boston. For years, he has controlled the streets with unparalleled authority. But now, that could change. The police has assigned a young man from another gang family turned police officer, Billy Costigan (3-Time Oscar Nominee Leonardo DiCaprio), to infiltrate Costello's system with hopes of bringing him down once and for all. Meanwhile, Costello has assigned his most loyal and trusted friend, Colin Sullivan (Oscar Winner Matt Damon), to be a mole within the Massachusetts State Police Department. When both sides discover that they have a mole in their midsts, it's war between the police and Costello.The real standouts of the film are DiCaprio, Mark Wahlberg, Jack Nicholson, director Martin Scorsese, and writer William Monahan. The cast is phenomenal, probably the best ensemble acting this year. DiCaprio gives the second best performance of his career (only to Blood Diamond, an Oscar nominated performance), a role which really is an actor's role. There are so many emotions involved with the character of Billy Costigan, and DiCaprio expresses them naturally. The feelings of fear, hate, depression, and indecision are displayed naturally and perfectly. It would have been very easy to nominate him for 2 Oscars in 2007, but they don't allow that. Mark Wahlberg gives the best performance in the whole film as the menacing cop Dignam. He steals the show in every scene he's in with his intensity and no holding back approach in this Oscar nominated performance. He upstages just about every other actor in this film, and looking at DiCaprio and Nicholson, that's extremely impressive. Jack Nicholson is the villain of the film, and he is just plain scary. There are moments when you will jump in fear of him, and you won't laugh at his jokes (not because they're not funny, but because you're scared to laugh at him). DiCaprio and Nicholson feed extremely well off of each other. DiCaprio has a thing for working well with other great actors (see Johnny Depp, Daniel Day Lewis, Cate Blanchett, Djimon Hounsou, and Tom Hanks). The other stars, while they are great, are not at the level of Wahlberg, DiCaprio, and Nicholson. It's not really his fault, but Matt Damon just doesn't seem right with a Boston accent. He does capture the essence of his character very well. Colin Sullivan is a character you may not understand at first, but as the film progresses, you'll know his motives and understand his actions. Well done by Mr. Damon. Vera Farmiga is proving to be one of the next generation up and comers with her second golden performance of the year (Running Scared was the other). Her ability to display powerful emotions such as anger and sadness pave the way for her to eventually become a leading lady in the caliber of Hilary Swank or Reese Witherspoon. Her performance as the conflicted and truly good Madolyn is one of the best of the year, and it's a shame she's been overlooked so much in the awards field. It must be because her character has the least connection to the main story, while she is strongly connected to Damon and DiCaprio's characters. Alec Baldwin and Ray Winstone give great performances, both being in small supporting roles. Winstone in particular stood out to me. In the smallest supporting role is Anthony Anderson, an actor generally known for comedy. With Hustle & Flow, and now The Departed, Anderson is proving that he is one of the more versatile performers in the business with a good and likable performance.Writer William Monahan pens an excellent script adapted from the Asian thriller 'Infernal Affairs'. Monahan does not allow the story to slow down at all, making it feel much shorter than the 2 and a half hours it runs. Monahan develops every character extremely well, and that is the strong point, because there really aren't that many twists, and no huge one either. Monahan won the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar because of the excellent characters he created.Legendary director Martin Scorsese won his first Oscar for this film because his film-making here, and all the time, is simply amazing. From the cinematography, to the sets and backgrounds he created, to the direction of a trio of phenomenal leading performances and a couple great supporting performances, Scorsese is at the top of his game in 'The Departed'. It's his best in a long time, possibly his best film. It's extremely hard to find fault with 'The Departed', except that I wish Mark Wahlberg had more screen time...but that was just because he was so damn good. 'The Departed' is one of the best films of the last 25 years, and should not be missed by any true fan of the movie industry. Remember, it won Best Picture of 2006, which it rightfully deserved. I absolutely loved this film, and recommend it to everyone age 16 and up, due to the brutal violence, strong language, and sexually explicit dialog. The 'f' word is spoken over 200 times, if you need an idea of how severe it is.10/10 --spy",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Scorsese's Masterpiece of Boston Gangsters and Crooked Cops,"Martin Scorsese should easily finally take home his first Academy Award for Best Director for ""The Departed"". With consummate skill he has assembled bewilderingly complex and varied ingredients: performers, story, settings, photography - with the result being a film that grabs your attention in the first few moments and doesn't let up until the credits roll. The film clocks in at a minute less than 2 1/2 hours. With about 10 minutes left the Mrs. and I shared that we both needed a bathroom break after our half-gallon sodas... but neither of us dared leave.The screenplay, I learn, was adapted by William Monahan from a Hong Kong script by Siu Fai Mak which was translated into English as ""Internal Affairs"". I also read that Mr. Scorsese didn't see the Chinese film but, rather, worked from an English translation of the ""Internal Affairs"" script. The story is a compelling narrative and Mr. Monahan has adapted the story to a Boston setting of Irish cops and gangsters. The dialog is full of sharp, witty one-liners, but also with a realistic, gritty ring of truth. The language reflects the setting of South Boston, not Sesame Street, so if your ears burn with the constant use of profanity - you may want to wait for an ""edited for TV"" version.The cast is brilliant. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a sizzling performance as a Boston ""Southie"" who joins the police force at a tender age, but because of his family (his father was a local tough guy and his uncle a low level mobster)and intelligence(we're told he scored 1400 on his SAT - not usual police recruit material) he is recruited by a secret undercover unit to infiltrate the local mafia. We see him put through a grueling interview by his to-be superiors, Martin Sheen, full of paternal wisdom, and Mark Wahlberg, full of suspicions and vulgarities (but with many of the movie's best moments in a role that is no higher than maybe 5th or 6th billing.) At the same time DiCaprio is being recruited to infiltrate the mob, Matt Damon has been sent by the same mob to join the police force where, with his intelligence, etc, he is soon in a parallel secret unit investigating both his boss, Irish Mobster Frank Costello (in yet another defining performance by Jack Nicholson) and the ""mole"" who it is apparent has infiltrated the police force. (Among the many fine scenes are one where Damon gets to inform Nicholson that he is now leading the investigation to find - himself.) Jack's performance is a Nicholson special. Frank Costello is a nearly untouchable sociopath. (The reason Costello is ""ungettable"" by the Massachusetts police force is one of dozens of intricate twists and sub-plots.) Costello is vulgar and menacing and everyone in Boston quakes in his presence, from local priests to the scariest hit men. The Mrs. and I differ in our opinion of whether the film revolves around Costello (her view), since all the other characters revolve around him and, after all, he's played by the great Jack Nicholson, or whether DiCaprio's Billy Costigan is the main character (my opinion), since he has the most screen time and, if this story has a protagonist, Costigan is it. It's enjoyable to discuss such things, but it's quibbling. ""The Departed"" has so many well-drawn characters breathed to life by stellar actors in brilliant performances that it could easily populate two *good* films! Vera Farmiga was previously unknown to me, but she delivers in the only major female role as a police psychiatrist who graduated from Harvard, but takes the presumably lower-paying position because she wants to serve her community while she also helps her patients. In one of the trickiest roles of the film she becomes romantically attracted to both ""moles"", not knowing the ""true identity"" of either until the climax of the film. Her steely determination after she discovers that Matt Damon is the police department ""rat"" reminds me of Alida Valli's famous performance in ""The Third Man"" and her final scene in this movie (walking away from a funeral in a cemetery towards the camera in a single shot, completely ignoring the man who thinks he has romantic possibilities with her) is an obvious homage by Scorsese to Carol Reed's film classic.Ray Winstone (as Costello's right-hand man, ""Frenchie"") and Alec Baldwin (as the over-matched police detective who is trying to bring together the various machinations of the Boston detectives and undercover mob infiltrators) lead the next tier of supporting performances. It's just another sign of the overall quality of Mr. Scorsese's picture that actors who would ""star"" in other films take on roles that in other films would be fleshed out by unknowns.The films ends, I think, as it must, and it's fair to say it's a Noir ending and not a ""Hollywood"" ending. Over the weeks leading up to this year's Academy Awards this film will be praised more than the last 25 films nominated for ""Best Picture"" combined. All the praise and hoopla will make ""The Departed"" and it's various investors a lot of money. This makes me wonder - if great films like this are profitable, why bother with the other 99% of brainless dreck that shows up at my local cineplex every week?

This isn't just another 2 and 1/2 hour movie... This isn't just another Oscar stealer... This isn't just another Leonardo movie.... This isn't just another insane Nicholson part... This isn't just another heart-pounding thriller.... This isn't just another movie to not see with mommy...This is all of these things packaged together into a slice of movie history...Nicholson gets crazier and more powerful as time goes by, and in this movie he sure doesn't disappoint. Mark Wahlberg is truly a BAMF. Leonardo is, without a doubt, a gift from God to all movie fans out there. Matt Damon has grown and molded into a more complete actor and has the rising skills to be one of the elite in the future.The world is a sick and twisted place and no one understands that better than Martin Scorsese....",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"The original was not that long, and way better and intense.","This movie is too long, and it has too many twists which made it less intense than the original movie.There was no reason to put in so many twists and killings which only made this movie a little confusing and illogical. Even gangsters don't just kill random people everyday. They could have focused on the two main characters, made this movie shorter, that would be a little more interesting to watch.I wasn't sure that this was the copy of the Hong Kong movie until I saw cpt. queenan got thrown from the roof top.Overall, this is a bad copy of the original movie due to its bad storyline. Of course, it had so many famous actors. Otherwise, it could never have got such a high rating, even higher than the original movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Why are ""Southie"" films always so great?","OK, so I have an affinity for Boston, and a strange obsession with ""Southie"" or, the Irish area in South Boston. I personally have a list of My top ten movies of all time, based, primarily on their ""re-watch-ability"", their constant creeping into my mind, acting, how witty the dialogue is, and ""other"". I would be greatly surprised, if, ten years from now, I am not quoting this Scorcese masterpiece. The dialogue is so witty, and the characters so memorable, and the ending....ohhhhh, the ending! Mark Wahlberg, pound for pound, was the best character. However, the greatest line belongs to Mr. Alec Baldwin. In a high stress sequence where the Boston Police are onto the bad guys, Alec Baldwin, says to one of the other cops in rapid fire delivery, ""Hey, I'm gonna have a cigarette..you want a cigarette?..what? You don't smoke?..What are you some kind of health nut?..Hey F&*% You!!!"" If that doesn't translate well to print...go watch the movie, see for yourself. Damon is fantastic, DiCaprio is excellent, Nicholson is great, and no one in the cast is a liability, even the ""love interest"", which, I had read in some reviews was lackluster, I thought, was great. So GO watch this Movie, and if you love the dialogue, then go rent...NO BUY, Good Will Hunting, and the Boondock Saints (My other favorite Boston Movies) Oh, and don't forget Goodfellas!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
good but not goodfellas.,"Right lets get a few things straight this is not the performance of Jack Nicholson's career (although its good), it is not the return to form we were hoping for from Scorsese and neither Matt Damon nor Leonardo Decaprio are that convincing as the two main cops. All that aside this isn't that bad a film, there are moments of Scorsese magic, there is a stellar cast including Ray Winstone, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin to name a few of the excellent actors here, it has a great soundtrack and a killer script. Sadly it is a bit too long and not as good as 'Internal Affairs' on which it is based. Where it does shine it really is very bright but the flaws hold it back too much to be a career high for anyone involved, it is a lazy 'Goodfellas' at best and a Snatch/Lock Stock hybrid at worst. The casting of Matt and Leo (neither of which I rate as actors) as the rookie cops is an inspired take on the original story but the fact that in Internal Affairs the two cops trying to rat each other out had been on the force for so long gave the film a gravitas that just isn't here. A rather flimsy tentative connection is hinted at by a love interest they both find themselves sharing but it never goes anywhere, in fact her character just kind of disappears out of the plot leaving unanswered questions. Essentially the script highlights, apart from Nicholson, come from the banter between Baldwin and Wahlberg as the two department heads set with the task of bringing down Costello (Nicholson) but neither having access to each others resources. Being a rare 18 certificate means that Scorsese can still get graphic if needs be and he does. There are laughs, winces and tension and enough twists to keep your head spinning. Scorsese has also embraced the technological revolution and made mobiles and texting a prevalent form of communication between the cops and the bad guys and especially for the moles to sneak out info. Without spoiling the end or any of the really good bits I cant really say anymore, just that this is an OK film, not brilliant by Scorsese's earlier standards but worth seeing none the less, certainly the best he's done for a while.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
if Marty was trying to parody himself he's a genius.  i don't think he was trying.,"so lame. you didn't believe any motives behind any character. Nicholson & marky mark make you laugh i hope on purpose.

Unique in this type of films,"The film is very violent indeed, but its artistic merits are truly overwhelming. It is rare to see such a high standard of acting, and this unqualified praise is for the entire cast. It is too neutral politically but one can draw one's own conclusions. Directing and editing are excellent, too. The film makes a Compelling viewing and it is even thought-provoking. A word of polite criticism: the violence is sometimes excessive and I detected at least four or five people at the theatre who actually laughed as if they witnessed a slapstick-type comedy. I feel that some creative restraint would have been helpful. Fortunately, the assured handling of the plot by the director has proved to be the decisive factor in the film's outstanding overall impact. I am almost certain that viewers will Cherish it even in 40 years time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Brilliant, brilliant performances","OK now... I've never been a big Leonardo DiCaprio fan, but I have always believed that he is a brilliant actor. ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"", ""Gangs of New York"", ""Catch Me If You Can"", ""The Aviator"" and now ""The Departed."" All fantastic performances. This might be a bit premature for me to say, but after four Golden Globe nominations with one win, plus two Oscar nominations... come on Academy people, hand over an Oscar to this guy, he deserves it. (Martin Scorcese's is a whole other request... I've given up on that one). He really held his own against an acting powerhouse like Jack Nicholson (who was, of course, great as well). In fact there were times when he actually stole the scene from him. If ever there was a character you sympathised with from the very beginning, it was this guy. And DiCaprio's performance really helped build that feeling.Matt Damon has been steadily pacing himself as an actor of immense worth as well. His career speaks for itself. Solid performances every time. It was nice to see him play a character like this though. I agree with people here who say he should do this type of role more often. He was believable, it worked.Martin Sheen was, well, Martin Sheen. Great screen presence.Alec Baldwin was hilarious. I love the way he just disappears into his characters. He just 'blends in' with the atmosphere created by the scene. Swift, sharp dialogue execution. I love it.But Mark Wahlberg stole the show for me. He didn't have as much screen time as the others, but man oh man, he just killed it. Brilliant performance. There are times when you wonder whether he's going to be in the next scene just so you can see him again. He stood out in every scene he was in: in the beginning with Sheen and DiCaprio and then later with Nicholson, Baldwin and Damon. I think he's always had this in him, but he really needed a quality film like this (Scorcese being the director has gotta help) to show what he can really do. I was blown away by his performance.In fact there wasn't a hair out of line in all the performances. We've all been hearing it for weeks and I'll just say it again... this is a superbly-cast movie.Now with the acting out of the way, let's get to the rest of the movie. It was thrilling, it was suspenseful and it took me a few minutes to get used to the ending, but the longer I thought about it, the more I liked it. I haven't seen ""Internal Affairs"" so I have no idea how similar this is to that. But I don't like making too many comparisons anyway. This movie stands out quite prominently on its own. A bit of a slow start, but things really heat up after the first hour.Highly recommended. :-) ****/***** 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Scorsese's Oscar,"Absolutely brilliant, super performance from every actor especially good old Jack and Dicaprio. And there are no excuses for not giving the Oscar to Scorsese this time !!! Also a good job by the pretty unknown Vera Fermiga who shines among the stars. Scorsese has done it again. My opinion is that this present time mob story actually is better than one of my favorites The Goodfellas. Very commendably. Problaby an Oscar for Dicaprio and another nomination for Nicholson. Its along time since we have seen Martin Sheen in a great role as Inspector Qeenan, Wahlberg does it good to. His role is a bit annoying but very important in the end (say no more). Damon is as always doing a good job but not as remarkable as Nicholson and Dicaprio who really shines. I haven't seen ""infernal affairs"" yet but after seeing The Departed I definitely have to see it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Better not win an Oscar.,"Sorry Martin, this felt very under par in terms of quality. There were parts of the movie where people within the crowd could feel the energy of a scene which lost its aim. There were laughs at parts where normal human beings would normally not laugh. Some of the lines were terrible. The editing at times looked like something out of a really bad student film. But what kept me going was the acting. When it was solid, it was SOLID. Matt and Leo are fan-freakin-tastic. The complexity of each of their characters dealing with their surroundings and the dynamic between Damon and Farmiga is amazing. Very true to life. But unfortunately the movie would anti-gravitize itself with a scene, sadly usually involving Jack Nicholson, which a line would be said or something would happen that seemed entirely out of place. Maybe that was the point to add a bit of awkward realism. But from a movie-going standpoint, it ruined the flow of certain parts. Over-all it was entertaining and the acting was phenomenal but definitely not a classic. I think Scorcese can definitely do better.I don't think I've seen so many people shot in the head in a movie before.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Finally!,"Finally, Martin Scorsese returns to the gritty underworld of crime in the United States. After ""Casino"", he left it - for whatever reason - and made a few bombs, followed by ""Gangs of New York"" and ""The Aviator."" One could say that after so many years away from the crime underworld (over 10) Scorsese could have lost his touch. This is just not so. The camera flies around just like in ""Goodfellas"" and keeps us on the edge of our seat for the two-and-a-half-hour run time. The violence, Scorsese's trademark for so many years, is kept in check by the director up until the bloody end - and that's not a British-ism; it's quite gruesome at the end. Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio are superb as the rat of Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) and the rat of the Boston PD inside Costello's crew, respectively. The plot is simple, but through his mastery of the camera, Scorsese keeps us interested and engaged. William Monahan's script is simple, but relatively well-done (this is only his second produced screenplay; his first was ""Kingdom of Heaven."") The supporting cast is excellent; Martin Sheen plays a high-ranking official in the Boston PD, Mark Whalberg plays his slight subordinate (Whalberg's Dingam is a real prick, but ultimately, a hero - kind of), Alec Baldwin plays the head of the Special Investigations Unit, who's tracking Costello (Costello's mole is within the Unit.) Scorsese has brought us back to the American crime underworld, and it is a journey that makes us realize: films like these are why we go to the movies in the first place.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Wow!  You people are easy to please.,"I am a fan of Martin Scorsese but this movie sucks. This movie is a remake of a Hong Kong movie called ""Internal Affairs."" If you have never seen the original, then please do so because you will definitely appreciate how well the original was as opposed to this crap made by Scorsese.Why do I hate ""Departed?"" First, Scorsese was an idiot putting Jack Nicholson as the crime boss because he is going to steal the whole damn movie. Nicholson is that talented. Plus, Scorsese gave too much part to the crime boss character. He should have been a tangential character with the real crux of the movie focused on Matt Damon and Di Caprio.Second, Matt Damon's character was too one dimensional or there was no real complexity to his character. He was simply bad. In Internal Affairs, the bad cop was more complex. In that movie, you see a cop becoming annoyed by the crime boss who he sees as a threat to his future.Third, there was more violence and sex in this movie than in Internal Affairs and I love gratuitous violence and sex in a movie so long as it is done properly. Scorsese just injected more sex and violence to cover up his terrible script adaption of an excellent film.Fourth, the dialog was fine but again, it lacks intelligent discourse among the principal characters so I cannot say it was great writing. It was simply mediocre at best.Fifth, and primary reason I hate this movie is that there is no real TENSION between the characters. Oh sure, Damon character wants to kill Di Caprio and vice a versa but there has to more to this than that. In the original, there was interaction between the bad cop and good cop, but you see that the bad cop is not so truly bad and therefore, the audience is torn. What I am trying to say is that there was a subtle buildup to the real tension in that movie which makes you really appreciative of the quality of that movie as oppose to this crap.That being said, if you have never seen Internal Affairs, then you will like this movie. But if you are like myself and some others who have seen it and have seen this movie as well, then you will be disappointed. In fact, for those who decide to rent Internal Affairs, I can almost guarantee that you will like Internal Affairs much more than Departed. You will like Internal Affairs so much more that you will see what a junk Departed really is.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

He's working with the big stars today, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Matt Damon, Martin Sheen, Anthony Anderson, you get the idea. The Departed lives up to it's reviews, plus more!It's about a man named William, played by DiCaprio, he's trying his best to be a cop, but do to his violent past and family, is put on probation and can only join if he does a special assignment for Oliver, Martin Sheen, and Digman, Mark Wahlberg. That is to spy on Frank, played by Jack Nicholson, the leader of the mafia in Boston, and find out information that will put him behind bars. But there is one other problem, there is a rat in the FBI gang that William is trying to get into, Colin is informing Frank that there is a rat in his mafia gang and will capture William. Who's the true rat? You'll just have to see!This movie is amazing on so many levels, it's not just the acting or picture, it's the story. It kept me going 'till the end, I just loved every scene.

"Watch Scorsese's The Departed for Damon, DiCaprio, Nicholson","Directed by Martin Scorsese. Starring Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, and Mark Wahlberg, The Departed is a compellingly dramatic story of moles in both the police and organized crime gangs in Boston. Nicholson is at his most charismatic over-the-top as mob boss Frank Costello, Damon is fine as Costello's informant at police headquarters, DiCaprio is excellent as the undercover cop trying to bring Costello down. Scorsese seems to show off his actors in the beginning but brings us full force by the time we find who Damon's ""father"" is on the phone.

An orgiastic bloodbath - elevated by great performances,"What started as a Hong Kong thriller has been elevated by the masterful touch of Scorcese. The Departed is most certainly a return to themes touched upon in older films such as Goodfellas, and even Taxi Driver, but more than his other recent projects, it seems Scorcese has ""matured"". Yes, this sounds strange - a director like him has always been an eloquent and masterful one - but here it seems as though he is looking back upon his career and making decisions based upon those that seemed correct in his past. The film? why worry - the plot is as similar as Heat, or any other crime thriller - the secret is in the delivery, and the way the director coaxes masterful performances from the cast.

A lot of one-dimensional characters, one-dimensional violence and over the top language. 273 times the word 'fuck' seems a bit overdone. On the other hand, diCaprio portraying a multi-layered character, full of doubts, was an absolute joy to watch. This in contrast to the other leads, which gave a rather charicatural performance.

The leads and supporting actors were not good, they were fantastic, gritty and raw. The moral fiber is shredded, the line separating good and bad faded, and drugs, money, and crime reign dominant. There was no one shining star in this film, Wahlberg, DiCaprio, Sheen, Damon and lets not forget Nicholson were superb.

Just one question for Mr. Scorsese: how many times will you shoot the same movie again and again? I mean, this one is the same as Casino, which was the same as Goodfellas... OK, the stories were a bit different, but they all look the same (the structure, the music, the acting). Hollywood has definitely lost the magic, all the movies are done the same way - you know what to expect. Just like you know what you'll get when you order a Big Mac.

Home Run Scorsese,"This film not only met the high expectations I held for it, but SURPASSED THEM. The Departed was expertly written, crafting each character's development thoroughly, without useless background information that would drag the length of the film. Everything took place ""in the now"" and kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. In fact, the movie flew by, but left me completely fulfilled and overly satisfied, well more like BURSTING AT THE SEEMS WITH EXCITEMENT!I was very impressed at how the plot took shape, and how every twist that was thrown into the mix never pushed the border of believability, but still wowed the audience entirely. The violence was exceedingly well done and strategically placed, adding the right amount of muscle behind the film, which only enhanced the color of each of the characters. The plot took into account the mindset of it viewers, and gave us an excellent scope into the undercover world of police officers. Whether or not there is complete validity to cut throat mentality surrounding this line of work didn't matter, it had me in complete belief of every character, and every piece of action. In addition to a brilliant script containing superb characters, the directing was also top notch by mister Scorsese. I enjoyed many of the artistic flares and interesting shots, but mostly the artful way he kept that dissonance of the two main characters in the forefront of the viewer's mind, making me as an audience member, really take interest into what was to come of each of them in the end. The finale of this film is bluntand perfect.I LOVE THIS CAST. Many times star studded movies can fall flat, as they rely on names, rather than writing an performance to draw money to the box office, but this was not the case. Leonardo DiCaprio was astonishing at every moment, and he plays this role PERFECTLY. I personally loved Mark Wahlberg's performance as well, and Alec Baldwin delivered an excellent supporting performance, truly allowing his character to shine, and adding high quality comic relief when needed.The soundtrack also surprised me slightly, and I loved the Irish flare the dropkick murphys added. It kept things interesting to say the least. Overall this is an EXCELLENT, WELL CRAFTED PIECE OF ART!

"This tantalising story traces the race between opposing moles. This is interwoven around the Irish American gangs in Boston, rather superbly led by an ""on form"" Jack Nicholson","As an Englishman living in Hong Kong, i am in the unusual position of having seen the original ""Infernal Affairs"" in the cinema in 2002, and now ""The Departed"" in the self same cinema 4 years later. Both are first class movies. The remake is very loyal to the original, and only locations and a few minor changes have been made. It is one of the best movies of this genre i have seen in a long time. Probably the best since i saw the original one. I would say that Martin Sheen was slightly miscast, and Matt Damon, although good, does not get the same sympathy from me as did Andy Lau in the original version. The point about this is that you should like this character,which is at odds with the fact that he is a bad guy. I tended to like Andy Lau, whereas Matt Damon was not quite so likable. This is a rather ""picky"" point, and would probably only be picked up by somebody who has seen both versions.

Another masterpiece by the master of crime,"There is no question as to the level of genius that Martin Scorsese portrays in every piece of art that he creates. Anything the man touches turns to magic. Even with that said, it sets the bar far too low to measure a masterpiece we know as The Departed. I can honestly say that I am a fan of crime family, mastermind scam, and mafia movies. They seem to appeal to the darker side of me that has never and will never be unleashed. The Departed grabbed a hold of that darker side and did not let go until my darker side was whipped into criminal submission. My Irish-rooted soul was bound to the cast of characters in the lore of Mick cops and gangsters; and the sex, drugs, and brutal use of violence left films like Scarface simply wanting. I am not completely sure if I can say that The Departed is my favorite mafia movie, considering The Godfather is still out there, but it is up there on the chart.

Daft,"Y'know, I don't think I've actually watched much Scorcese before I watched this last night with the missus, but I can understand why people rate him so highly - in terms of putting together a tight piece of entertainment and getting convincing (albeit not necessarily realistic) performances out of his actors, he's indisputably one of the best, but I couldn't escape the impression that this film was utterly ridiculous. The good points are many; Jack is 200% fun to watch, it rattles along at a rate of knots and I was always intrigued to see what happened next (despite it dragging in a couple of scenes near the end)amongst others, but equally there were places where I thought, ""Oh come on...""; I wouldn't know a Boston accent if I heard it, but despite that, even I could tell that a fair whack of them were mangled, especially Ray Winstone's (you're great to watch, Ray, but please, god, stick to Cockney). And I didn't really buy Vera Farmiga's character, but then I've lived a very sheltered life...I guess I was expecting something more hard hitting rather than this silly, but as I say, it was a lot of fun.

Excellent,"Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) is a mole inside Costello's (Nicholson) crime gang. Colin Sullivan (Damon) is a mole inside the Boston Police Dept. When the cops and Costello find out each has a mole among them, things get more than interesting.It is more than nice to have an all star cast performing an excellent story. This doesn't happen often and doesn't disappoint. Plus the fact that it moved along at such a lively pace the 2 ½ hours didn't seem like 2 ½ hours. One can easily see how this was nominated for Best Picture (which it won) and also how Martin Scorsese was nominated for Best Director (which he won). And, one can also see how some of the stars could have been nominated for Best Actor or Best Supporting Actor: DiCaprio, Damon or Nicholson (but none were).But, there is one area that surely needs to be recognized and that is the film editing, and by-God it won for that too. This was a cat mouse-chess game and the shots went back and forth at a rapid pace at times and yet, and you didn't lose the thread. Great editing job.This is a movie you have to stay with. If you give yourself an intermission while the DVD is still running, you may lose something you probably need to know later on. So pay attention.When we saw the Academy Awards we saw Jack Nicholson looking like Mr. Clean, Lex Luthor, Kojack, or Daddy Warbucks (take your pick) and we feel the reason for this is because Jack saw himself in this movie and realized he had a really bad hair day all the way through. Also, did anyone but me notice some facial similarities between DiCaprio and Nicholson?

how do you feel about the ending?,"OK. i'm opening this topic cause i'm having mixed feelings about the ending of the movie. when i'm talking about the ending, i'm talking about the part from the moment Leonardo realizes that Damon is a rat in the force, and on.first of all - why does Leo run away? makes no sense for him to run and then later tries to ""arrest"" Damon. why doesn't he go straight to Baldwin?! 2. what's the thing with the yellow envelope?!? he gives it to psychiatrist and then...what? no sense, again. 3. everybody get's killed. after seeing Goodfellas (imdb auto corrected the name) and the casino i can understand that Scorsese likes to kill everybody on the end. but in this point, it makes no sense! what was i watching for 2 hours if on the end - no one wins? the mobs get wiped out, the good guy, the bad guy, innocent people (like the black cop). why? i mean, what's the point of executing everybody? who won? what have i learned in this movie?if you ask me, a great movie with perfect performance, almost unseen quality acting crew, interesting story during all of the movie... and it gets destroyed on the ending showing us that actually there is no winner. it just has NO ENDING. that frustrated me, a lot.2 more questions. why in the name of god would Wahlberg kill Damon??? unless of course it was Wahlberg who ""got killed"" in front of an elevator by Damon. i'm not sure of that. first i thought it was him, but then my friend said it's not true, that it is another cop. 2nd question. if Damon ""wasn't the only one"" working for Nicholson in the force, what did the other guy do? what ever Nicholson did, what ever he needed help with, Damon was the one who would tip him off and save his ass. so what the f..k did the other mole do for Nicholson?my opinion after a long conversation with my friend: the end is not Scorsese's work. i think the producers said ""ok, we want it to be this way"" and it had to be like that. cause a disturbing and illogical ending like this is nothing like Scorsese. i just can't believe it's so.i gave this movie a ""7"" just for the ending. unfortunately i will always remember it as ""could-of-been-a-master-piece"" but didn't cause the ending was destroyed it. hope to see a directors cut.cheers all!",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I'll Keep it short for now - excellent!,"I will start by saying what a massive fan I am of foreign cinema - I love the original trilogy - Infernal Affairs. When I first head that a remake was being made I instantly took a harsh stand against it - thinking how could they destroy such a masterpiece of a film (hence what will happen with the Oldboy remake). I watched this last night - had high hopes - excellent cast, excellent director.The film ultimately was amazing for me - yes the script is very much based on the Infernal Affairs (hence it being a remake). But I can't help but feel that Scorscese really has made this shine.Another huge surprise for me was Leonardo Di Caprio - thoughts about his role before watching the film I felt I was going to be very disappointed. But I really do feel he deserves an Oscar for this.Watch it you will not be disappointed - especially if you are a fan of the original trilogy.Glad it kept it's ""18 / NC-17"" certificate Utterly Adult humour, violence and story in every sense of the word!!Definite 10/10 for me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"An Instant Scorsese Classic, Nicholson Dominates...","""The Departed"" will join director Martin Scorsese's other classic crime dramas, arguably on a par with ""GoodFellas"" in particular. This film easily swept the Academy Awards in 2007, winning Best Picture, Best Director, Best Editor and Best Adapted Screenplay.This classic film is set in Boston, where two young police cadets( Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio) are pulled into the web of betrayal and murder orchestrated by Irish crime boss Frank Costello (played by the legendary Jack Nicholson). The complex plot is based on the Hong Kong film ""Internal Affairs""(2002) of which ""The Departed"" is a remake. The film is packed with A-list talent; in addition to that mentioned above, the movie also stars Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, and Mark Wahlberg.The screenplay for ""The Departed"" is among the best ever written for a crime drama, it keeps the action moving at a fast clip and delivers clever dialogue alongside fantastic character development. Martin Scorsese won his first Academy award for Best Director for this picture; a well-deserved and long-delayed honor for one of America's greatest directors. It's easy to see why Scorsese won for this film, it is yet another brilliant expose of his masterful skill as a director.Jack Nicholson dominates this film. His performance as crime boss Frank Costello is brilliant and seems to come effortlessly to this living legend of the silver screen. The Costello character is ruthless and Machavellian to say the least, he ""adopts"" the young Colin character (Conor Donovan, played as an adult by Matt Damon) who grows up to join the Massachusetts State Police, thereby giving the crime boss an inside man within law enforcement, and the perfect ally to protect and expand his various rackets. From Nicholson's opening line, he outshines the other actors with screen presence alone, and then eclipses them altogether with his classic line deliveries.Leonardo DiCaprio has grown to full maturity as a true A-List actor. His third collaboration with Scorsese (following 2002's ""Gangs Of New York"" and 2004's ""Tha Aviator"") as police cadet-turned-undercover cop Billy Costigan is perfectly performed, illustrating Scorsese's continued ability to draw out DiCaprio's best interpretations. Matt Damon revisits familiar territory as a South Boston cop, this role recalls his performance in ""Good Will Hunting"" complete with authentic Boston accent. Damon also works well under Scorsese, portraying the duplicitous, crooked cop Colin; his performance is sharp and well-balanced.Mark Wahlberg's character Staff Seargent Dingnam is all wit and constant profanity, giving him the majority of the hilarious one-liners and zingers in this film. Martin Sheen provides a perfect counterbalance to Wahlberg's character as Chief Queenan. Providing further evidence of perfect casting is Alec Baldwin, who portrays Lieutenant Ellerby, the most crass and humorous of the veteran officers. Ray Winstone also delivers a superb performance as the menacing, authoritative Mr. French, Costello's most trusted enforcer.The music of The Rolling Stones constantly drones in and out during the film, providing excellent atmosphere for a crime flick set on the mean streets.""The Departed"" is a instant classic, a great movie for fans of gritty, violent crime dramas ala ""The Sopranos"". Scorsese continues to exhibit his mastery for this genre of film, his best work to date.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A masterpiece !,One of the best police undercover movies of the decade! Brilliant acting especially by Dicaprio. A must watch!,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
tough guys shouting profanities with an intriguing plot,"Do you want to see a movie with cops and bad guys (and there is certainly some overlap between the two)? Then watch this movie.The best part of this movie is the intriguing story line that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the movie. In summary, the cops have planted ""a rat"" (DiCaprio) in the criminal organization led by Nicholson. But Nicholson has his own ""rat"" inside the police force (Damon). To make things more interesting there are also ""rats"" for the FBI, and both Damon and DiCaprio fall for the same woman. This then all plays out like a bloody game of chess where at the end both ""kings"" die.This is a star-studded movie where most of the actors do very well, especially DiCaprio and Damon. I found Sheen's Boston accent convincing and Nicholson of course does his thing. Some times I got the impression that there was a bit of competition going on between the actors. Like, who can play the toughest guy.The weakest point of the movie was the psychologist who is torn between DiCaprio and Damon. The speed at which she falls for the convict (as far as she knows) DiCaprio seems unprofessional and unrealistic. There is never a real confrontation between DiCaprio and Damon over her as one might expect, but the documents that DiCaprio gives to her (not to be opened until something happens to him) end up being Damon's downfall.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Highly recommended,"To much are mobsters romanticized, the mob is full of the most depraved and horrible people on the earth and Scorsese certainly showed that in the Departed. I kept hearing about this movie before I seen it, about how good it was, and I certainly was not disappointed. It has a complex storyline and even more complex characters, and are brought together in a great way. The acting is fantastic, every actor in the movie gave the performance of their career. I loved this movie and it is a rare movie that is full of suspense, actions, and stills has a deep impact on the emotional level. This is the only must see movie in the last 2 years, and it is best Scorsese has ever done.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
