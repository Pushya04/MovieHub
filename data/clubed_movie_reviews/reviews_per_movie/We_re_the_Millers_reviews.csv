Good for lazy evening on the sofa,"If you've seen enough movies you know exactly how this is going to end a few minutes in, so the fun is watching how they work the plot towards that conclusion.It's an enjoyable movie with humor that sometimes made me cringe and other times laugh out loud. Jason S. is typecast in this role, but he has good screen chemistry with Jennifer A. The two kids play their roles well, the boy maybe too well.If you like sexually charged humor, or want something to tune out with, I can recommend it. The biggest compliment I can give it is saying I hope they make a sequel.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Will probably be regarded as a ""so dumb but so funny"" comedy.","There's nothing to it, if all you're looking for witty/clever/subtle/deep humor, and you hate sexual/stupid/slapsticky type humor...you will probably still like We're The Millers.It's not a gold mine of comedy by any means, but it did the job it told us it would do: Make us laugh and give us a fun ride. They really brought together a dysfunctional family and did it in a way that allowed for some suspension of disbelief. A lot of comedies nowadays have those hit or miss scenes where you either laugh, or you just can't suspend your disbelief and you're sitting there like ""Really? Really? She's gonna poop in the sink?"" (guess the reference). We're The Millers is pretty much a compilation of those kinds of scenes that hit just the right tone to pull it off as funny, clever and it just kinda grows on you.The ""family"" we see on screen for most of the surprisingly high 109 minute runtime is in a lot of ways funny, in some ways disgusting, and in a few ways charming. The film just works with the pairing of Sudeikis and Aniston, as we saw for a tiny bit in Horrible Bosses, which to me is one of the funniest movies in a long while. If you liked Wedding Crashers, or Hot Tub Time Machine, chances are you'll like this one, which was written by the 4 screenwriters who worked on those films. The 2 pairs of writers who have a history with comedy throw some subtle humor in the dialog which you probably won't get if you're not paying enough attention, which allows for every comedy lovers dream: To be laughing out loud, then hearing an ever so subtle joke causing you to laugh harder, then hearing another one and another and another. The film was consistently funny in a sense that when it got me, it REEALLLY got me.Overall, the film is just a slight bit lovable, with characters you actually kinda like...not too common for a modern comedy. More so than the story, the laughs came interspersed well enough to where I can't complain because I did way more laughing than I expected. It wasn't ""rolling on the floor"" funny, but I did have some hearty laughs out loud.Recommended to anyone who enjoyed the previous works by the screenwriters.7/10EDIT: I ended up seeing it a second time and tried to pay attention to all of the funny subtlety of one-liners and witty remarks by characters throughout, and I laughed very hard at quite a few things I didn't catch the first time. I liked it more the second time and raise my rating to an 8/10. Is truly a very funny film.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Finally!!! A solid comedy!!!,"I have to admit I didn't expect to like this movie as much as I did. I laughed during the whole movie and truly didn't notice how did the time pass by. For me this is the best American comedy I've seen in the past couple of years. Very well directed, very good cast. The movie is very casual but at the same time so full of content. I can't come up with any flaws in it. It was not gooey like you would normally expect. Jennifer Aniston was just marvelous as always. I also liked Will Poulter very well.I recommend the film to everyone, not only comedy lovers (I'm surely not one of those).",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
An actually funny comedy,"'We're the Millers' follows a drug dealer, a stripper, a runaway and a geek, who come together pretending to be a traditional, all American suburban family to smuggle a whole heap of drugs from Mexico into the US. Fortunately for us, Jennifer Aniston plays a stripper. With all the actors playing surprisingly likable characters, who's opposing chemistry works impeccably when put together.I usually find that most of the time, films that parade around claiming to be comedies, usually with one famous face to show, are often just not funny. But 'We're The Millers' was actually a good comedy; probably not in a witty sophisticated way, but it made me laugh. This film also has its emotions, in their own little unconventional ways, considering the leads were not exactly your average person.If I had to think of the one thing that I found extremely obnoxious, it would have to be Ed Helms. Everything about his character and his acting, was just annoying, which is probably why the ending made me quite happy.Worth watching if you need a no-brainer to spike your mood. And if not for the laughs, I'm sure Jennifer Aniston stripping would do the trick.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Family redefined. Along the same old lines. Funny!!,"We're the Millers (2013)Okay, this seems like just another goofy comedy, but it's pretty great. It's funny, has lots of fun twists, and some good comic lines. But more than that, it creates a kind of intimacy and sense of real family (a sense of it) that makes you realize what family is all about. Yeah, unlikely, I know, but it works. When the two ""fake"" parents start to act like real ones, it's funny but also moving.Who woulda thought?It's hard to say who pulls this off—clearly the ""parents"" are terrific, Jennifer Aniston and Jason Sudeikis. And the two kids are pretty good too, if clichéd. But what makes it all happen is the breezy comic writing. The basic set up is filled with clichés, and you have to like corny humor to really enjoy the play on these. So there are drug lords and immigrations officials. There are dorky RV tourists and clueless bystanders everywhere. But kick back and don't' expect too much and be surprised.And don't miss the bloopers in the final credits. Among them is a great moment where they play the theme to ""Friends"" on the RV radio, and it seems to catch Aniston by surprise. Group admiration.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"The fake family brings many laughs, the other elements bring a few groans","""We're the Millers"" is a stoner comedy, except better than that because it's written as a family comedy - well, inappropriate family comedy. Oh, and it's actually funny. All of the main and supporting actors keep bringing the jokes so you can over-look the ridiculous plot. David (Jason Sudeikis) is still a pot dealer, even though he's 20 years past college.Two teens in need of parental figures screw up his simple drug-dealing lifestyle and now he has to smuggle a load of marijuana across the border. A fake family should be the perfect cover to fool the hapless border guards. He hires the two teens and his sexy neighbour, Rose (Jennifer Aniston), who is working as a stripper, even though she's more than 20 years past college.The comedy builds slowly, but then a fake baby (let's call her Mary Jane) enters the picture and the laughs come fast and furious. Some jokes weren't as funny as they thought (their new friends' sex acts), but by this time our fake family has connected with one another and the audience, and their obvious ending can drive us towards the conclusion of the ridiculous plot.Overall, ""We're the Millers"" is pretty funny, and if you're watching a stoner comedy, you should be pretty forgiving of any nonsense the plot throws at you.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Surprisingly Entertaining,"I was really excited to see this movie when I saw the trailer, because I thought it looked hilarious, and I'm a huge fan of Jason Sudeikis and I absolutely adore Jennifer Aniston, and I can guarantee that it does not disappoint. It was actually better than I was expecting it to be, because you don't usually expect much from drug dealing comedies. The plot in this was actually pretty clever, and to be honest Will Poulter's character Kenny really makes the entire movie. He played it so well, and he was perfectly awkward and strange, it was hilarious. It was definitely one of the best comedies I've seen in a while. Sure it did have some corny moments that are unrealistic, but I overall enjoyed the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Very entertaining and a good laugh,"As far as comedies go this is certainly one of the best I've watched over the last few months. It is an interesting combination of characters which work really well together. You've got the drug dealer, the geek, the stripper and the runaway (who in my opinion is more of a rebel than anything else).The story itself isn't the strongest element of this movie, however in my opinion Jason Sudeikis, Jennifer Aniston and Will Poulter all deliver a really great performance.As funny as Ed Helms is in 'The Hangover' I feel the script didn't really allow for his character to emerge as much.Overall I really enjoyed watching this movie and I recommend it to anyone looking for a good laugh.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Well...,"Went to hate it, left loving it. Great funny ""real"" movie. Starts and ends like everyone movie, you know it from the beginning, but the laughs and the experiences this gang faces is well don. Not over the top , just laughs and a somewhat sentimental story. Not sure why all the bad reviews, went in with an opened mind and walked Out laughing and talking with friends about how much we enjoyed it. I encourage anyone in the edge to go catch this film. Good for Jen and good for Jason, more daughter and this would be great. Kenny almost stole the show... Man has no heart finds family and gains one. Worth watching Do it!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Dumb Fun,"Jennifer Aniston plays a stripper in this movie. I think that's all that needs to be said here.We're The Millers follows local pot dealer David Clark (Jason Sudeikis) after unfortunate circumstances lead his boss, Brad Gurdlinger (Ed Helms), to have him transport a giant shipment of weed from Mexico into the U.S. To do this, David assembles a fake family bearing the last name Miller to cross the border without suspicion. This family consists of Rose O'Reilly (Jennifer Aniston), a stripper who lives in David's apartment block, Kenny Rossmore (Will Poulter), David's dorky neighbor, and Casey Mathis (Emma Roberts), the local ""gutter punk"".While this particular story may be original, the way the movie plays out is completely cliché. When watching the movie you're going to be able to tell what's gonna happen next as far as the progression of emotion between the characters. The classic at first they don't get along, then they start to have fun, then they find out something about one of the characters that upsets them, yada yada yada. You know the drill. But I'm very lenient with comedies because they have one job: to make me laugh and We're The Millers, for the most part, does its job successfully.This is a very dumb comedy. There is no joke that takes any thought to figure out, but the movie never seems full of itself. It's very self aware and doesn't try to be something it's not. That being said, I don't know if I would have liked the movie as much if it wasn't for the cast, particularly Sudeikis and Poulter. Sudeikis just has a natural charm to him and he delivers lines that aren't actually that great in ways that make them funny (Also he's engaged to Olivia Wilde, so good on him). Poulter has the perfect face for this role. I almost feel bad for saying it but his character was hilarious just because he's such a dorky looking guy. Aniston and Roberts do what they can with what they're given in the script but neither of them really did anything that stood out to me (Except for a scene that was actually rather uncomfortable after Kenny attempts to flirt with a girl). Also, Nick Offerman is in the movie for a little bit and has a really awesome scene involving a mug. None of the other actors really do anything worth mentioning, which sucks because Ed Helms is in this movie and nothing with him made me laugh due to the unfortunately weak script. Really it's the actors that made this movie likable, and the fact that the b-reel during the credits of the movie is funnier than most of the actual movie backs that up.What you see in the trailer for the movie is basically exactly what you get: A pretty enjoyable comedy, although nothing remarkable. Speaking of the trailer, it actually gives a lot of the best laughs away (as most trailers do) so if you haven't seen it or you don't really remember it, don't watch it! This Is The End still reigns champion as this year's best comedy, but I'd say We're The Millers is good in its own right.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
One of my favorite comedies of all-time,This movie is hands down one of my favorite comedies of all time. There is no way you could watch this movie and not laugh constantly. This is a fun ride the entire ride. It is outrageous at times (but in a great way) but also has heart warming scenes and it all just mixes together in an incredible way. Everyone of the main characters plays their parts to perfection. It just hits all the spots that a great comedy should hit. If you have not seen this movie WATCH IT RIGHT NOW. You will not be disappointed!,10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
An amusing and funny film about a group of misfit characters who pretend to be a well-off family.,"This diverting and decent story has lots of amusement, fun, giggles and being pretty entertaining. David Burke (Jason Sudeikis) , a marijuana dealer, has all his drug merchandise and money stolen, leaving him with nothing to pay his supplier, Brad (Ed Helms). The only way to settle the score is to bring Brad's new shipment from Mexico, for which he needs a good cover-up. So a fake family is formed: David as a alleged good father, sardonic stripper Rose (Jennifer Aniston) assuming the role of housewife, teenage misfit Kenny (Will Poulter) posing as the awkward son, and rebellious Casey (Emma Roberts) filling in as his sister. The peculiar family starts heading south. Meanwhile, as David tries to convince himself that the border patrol wouldn't give a second glance at such a typical suburban family, the shipment -- and the stakes -- both prove greater than anticipated. Along the way, they encounter another family at the border called the Fitzgeralds, consisting of Don (Nick Offerman) , Edie (Kathryn Hahn), and Melissa (Molly Quinn). Later on , they are relentlessly chased by Chacon (Tomer Sisley) and his henchman One Eye (Matthew Willig) who are waiting for them and prepare to execute the family. On A Family Vacation, No One Can Hear You Scream !.Jennifer Ashton, Jason Sudeikis, Will Poulter and Emma Roberts play the false family that the film's protagonist decides to create to introduce the drug into the USA safely. The picture blends cynical sense humor , family relationship feeling , tongue-in cheek , adventures, and spectacular outdoors. There's an agreeable relationship among the members of the alleged family, they all get to know each other better and deeper and discover the real truths about their own pasts which could change the family forever. The movie contains numerous ingredients for the bemusing , it is an enjoyable comedy with attractive family bonds and glimmer landscapes. The sight gags , although predictable , are sometimes on the mark. However, being spoiled by some tasteless, crude scenes and continuous sexual references that may bother more traditional viewers. In the style of a ¨Road Movie¨, Jason Sudeikis plays a little drug dealer, Anishton a stripper, Roberts plays a teenage runaway and Poulter a dim-witted boy. They all share good chemistry and the spectator enjoys it. They are joined by a good supporting cast, such as: Ed Helms, Nick Offerman, Kathryn Hahn, Tomer Sisley, Matthew Willig, Luis Guzmán, Thomas Lennon, among others.Furthermore, it contains a lively and charming musical score by composers Ludwig Göransson and Theodore Shapiro; as well as colorful cinematography by cameraman Barry Petersen. This film is sufficiently budgeted and was professionally directed by Rawson Marshall Thurbe, though it has some flaws and implausibilities. Here he returns to the mischievous comedy of his feature film debut: ¨Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story¨. Rawson's a good filmmaker and producer, known for ¨Central Intelligence¨, ¨Red Notice¨, ¨Easy A¨, ¨Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story¨,¨Skyscraper¨and this ¨We're the Miller¨. Director and his team of technicians blast the screen apart, delivering an acceptable film with full of humor and ridiculous situations, but neither notable, not extraordinary, but passable. Rating: 6/10. The film will appeal to Jennifer Anishton and Jason Sudeikis fans, that's why they are the complete show.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
We're the Millers,"A very interesting movie. I really enjoyed watching movies that made me laugh most of his comedy attempts, especially from Jennifer Aniston and Emma Roberts. The drama side was very weak.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The funniest scenes took place during the ending credits,"""This is not a smidge of pot! You got me moving enough weed to kill Willie Nelson, man!""We're the Millers is a raunchy comedy with some funny moments. It's an entertaining movie, but ultimately the script felt a bit lazy. The premise and the cast promised more, but director Rawson Marshall Thurber uses jokes and gags we've seen in other comedies. I did laugh at several scenes and there were some great lines, but I can't just judge a comedy based on that because usually I will laugh at anything. You know there is a problem with a comedy when all the audience laughs more during the end credits in the blooper reals than during the entire film. There are some awkward and uncomfortable scenes as well, and I didn't like the fact that they made all the lovable families look uncool and act as dorks in this film. Jason Sudeikis is a great actor and I would love to see him starring in more comedies. He has great comedic timing and delivers his lines with a perfect precision. Jennifer Aniston is also a very likable actress despite the fact that she really hasn't made a great film, but there is something about her that draws the audience. Will Poulter was the star of this film as he had the funniest scenes. He didn't have to say much, his facial expression alone was hilarious. This is the first comedy I've seen him in, although he did have some funny scenes in the last Narnia movie. Emma Roberts was probably the weakest link in this film, but I wouldn't blame her because her character was the least developed in the film. Ed Helms was a big disappointment for me here, his performance was way over the top, but Nick Offerman (Parks and Recreation) was effortlesly hilarious. I was a huge fan of Thurber's earlier film, Dodgeball (perhaps one of the few people who enjoyed that movie), but I can't give him a passing grade for this movie although I didn't have a bad time either.David (Jason Sudeikis) is a low profile pot dealer who receives his supplies from Brad Gurdlinger (Ed Helms). After getting robbed during a deal, Brad forces him to go to Mexico and bring back his latest marihuana shipment in order to pay his debt. Being a small dealer David has no idea how to cross the border as he realizes the consequences his actions may have. He believes that the best way to cross the border safely will be pretending he is on a family trip. The only problem is that he is single so he gets a local stripper named Rose (Jennifer Aniston) to pretend she is his wife, a streetwise angry teen named Casey (Emma Roberts), and his kind hearted neighbor Kenny (Will Poulter) to pretend they are his kids. He plans on getting across the border without problems by driving his apparently wonderful family on their big RV.The funniest scene in the movie happened during the final credits, but I also though there were some funny moments here and there, like when Kenny realizes that David is paying Rose and Casey to come along with him, or when Kenny gets bit by a spider. I also enjoyed some of the pop cultural references like when David thought he was going to be killed because of the plastic he was standing on claiming to know what it means because he has watched Dexter. The cameo with Luis Guzman was pretty funny as well. Those were some of the silly moments, but nothing that stood out or that I will probably remember tomorrow. The film is predictable and you know where it is heading, but it still is an enjoyable movie.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A Good Deal Funnier than I Expected,"When the trailers for WE'RE THE MILLERS started making rounds, I had no intention of watching it. It just looked dumb. Another low-brow comedy catering to the lowest common denominator. Then the reviews starting creeping out and the general consensus seemed to be that it wasn't all that bad. It wasn't going to win any awards and it's doubtful to be on anyone's top ten list for 2013, but it was fun. So with that little bit of encouragement (and Jennifer Aniston as a stripper) I finally relented and, you know, I don't regret it. It's not a great movie, but it's definitely got some laughs thanks to a pretty nice bit of casting. It's a road trip movie with familial themes but it never slaps you upside the head with them. The movie is about small-time drug dealer David Clark (Sudeikis). He's robbed one night by a gang of thugs who make off with all of his drugs and cash, leaving him on boss man Brad Gurdlinger's (Ed Helms) bad side. But he's willing to forgive David and even give him a nice little payday if he'll run down to Mexico, grab a ""smidge"" of marijuana, and bring it back across the border for him. David reluctantly agrees and formulates a plan of bringing the drugs across the border while attracting minimal attention: pose as a family on vacation and cross the border in an RV. But he's going to need a family. He recruits his stripper neighbor Rose (Aniston), a homeless punk (Emma Roberts), and a sheltered neighbor kid (Will Poulter) and soon the ""Millers"" are on their way to Mexico.My big concern with any ""family"" movie is, well, the family part. I hate overly saccharine, heart-felt moments in movies when someone realizes how much they love/need their family/loved ones/whatever. I was worried about finding that sort of sugary sap in WE'RE THE MILLERS with Sudeikis realizing how much better he feels when he drops the loner bit and starts to act as if these misfits are truly family. Andwell, OKthat does sort of happen but it doesn't shove your nose in it. It happens in small doses and usually comes with some raunchy humor to soften the blow and remind you, ""Don't worry, this is still a movie about drug smuggling and there's a stripper."" Aside from a final monologue moment from Sudeikis around the movie's climax, it's never too much. Each of the four main characters has the family deficiency issue and have their reasons to embrace their situation. David's a drug dealer and a bit of a loser, and he's reminded of the fact when he sees an old college buddy in the beginning of the movie who became a family man. Rose is a stripper but it's obviously not where she wants to be. Casey's a runaway, living on the streets with her iPhone, and Kenny's been home alone since his mom went out for a drink with friendstwo weeks ago. So, the seeds are all there for the finale we all expect but it's nice to see it's all thought out better than I expected from a drug comedy.The main reason this movie works as well as it does it the casting. I stopped watch ""Saturday Night Live"" before Jason Sudeikis joined the cast but I loved him in HORRIBLE BOSSES and he was one of the funnier bits of MOVIE 43, and WE'RE THE MILLERS gives him the chance to be the main character. He handles it well. I love his sense of humor and his comedic timing, and some of his line deliveries had me rolling. The other highlight is Nick Offerman as a fellow RV vacationer whose family the Millers meet and can't seem to shake. An All-American sort of dad with a distaste for profanity and the ultimate family man, Offerman's hilarious as he goes from leading his family in campfire songs one minute and offering the Miller's the chance for a little swinging the next. His wife Edie is played by Katherine Hahn and the two work perfectly together. The rest of the cast is fine enough. Aniston still seems a little odd delivering the raunchy dialogue but she's still hot, and so is Emma Roberts. Despite any flaws, the film works because the main four (Sudeikis, Aniston, Roberts, and Poulter) had a real good chemistry. WE'RE THE MILLERS was a lot funny than I ever anticipated, even when it wasn't firing on all cylinders. It was a fun comedy to help close out the summer and it sets itself up for a sequel with the Millers that, honestly, I'm not adverse to. I'd be down for another adventure with the family.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

They cater to the lowest common denominator and contain stupid sex and bathroom jokes.However, despite some stupid jokes along the way,""We're the Millers"" is a funny comedy with a great premise and good performances.A low-level drug dealer, David (Jason Sudeikis) is robbed of money he was delivering to his boss, an old college friend. His friend, rather than killing him, says they can wipe the slate clean if he will pick up a very small stash of drugs in Mexico for him under his ""Mexican"" name, ""Pablo Chacon."" David agrees, though reluctantly.He decides the best thing to do is travel as a tourist with a family to avoid interest from the police. He drafts a stripper who can't stand him (Jennifer Aniston) with the promise of money; a homeless girl, Casey (Emma Roberts), and a nerd (Will Poulter). Along the way they have to think fast, sometimes move faster, protect one another, and, without realizing it, they become a family.Lots of very funny stuff here, which comes out of the situations. And, despite the crazy characters, the movie has warmth. I wasn't that familiar with Jason Sudeikis' work as I don't watch Saturday Night Live, but he did a great job.

The review that no one will pay attention to (because it's bad),"Four stars sounds right for this film, which I just saw last night. 1 star being 'unbearably bad and difficult to sit through', and 10 being 'so good it changed my life', this movie was bearable to sit through, not painfully bad, but well... predictable and brainless.The good news, I saw it in the right frame of mind- not in the mood to think. Cliché characters, unoriginal jokes, and predictable story notwithstanding, the pull of the movie were the four main stars, especially Jason Sudeikis. I haven't followed him in SNL but every other role I've seen of his: ""30 Rock"", ""Portlandia"", and a few other appearances here and there- the guy is funny and charismatic.

Some people didn't expect anything and were pleasantly surprised, some expected too much and were disappointed. But even the cinema version might is not kid friendly.

Jason Sedakis is the drug dealer. He assembles a unlikely cast of characters as an ersatz family and off they go to Mexico.

What more could you possibly want?The other family members are a nerdy boy and a homeless girl. Both of them are hilarious for different reasons, the nebbish kid is sincere, honest and of course a willing dupe for all of the drug dealers schemes. Tension is added to the film by the appearance of a drug dealer who has been tricked into allowing his product to be sold to the wrong dealer and a DEA Agent and family that the Millers happen to befriend.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Incredibly Silly, But Incredibly Funny","Pros:
1. The saturated colour palette does a good job at reinforcing the light-hearted comedic tone.
2. Jason Sudeikis (David Clark), Jennifer Aniston (Rose O'Reilly), and Will Poulter (Kenny Rossmore) deliver fantastic comedic performances.
3. The costume design helps to portray the 'Millers' as the generic friendly white family.
4. The humour is hilarious and of the laugh-out-loud nature and it never misses a beat.
5. Jason Sudeikis, Emma Roberts, Will Poulter, and Jennifer Aniston all have amazing chemistry together.
6. The soundtrack is basic, but suitably fun and lively.Cons:
1. Ed Helms (Brad Gurdlinger) is horribly miscast as the main antagonist, with his over-the-top and goofy nature makes it hard to take his character seriously.
2. Tomer Sisley (Pablo Chacon) gives a rather stale performance.
3. The CGI orca and fish tank look awful.
4. Some of the sub-plots, such as Kenny Rossmore getting bit on the balls from a spider, feel wholly unnecessary and thus just inserted to increase the run-time and add in pointless drama and gags.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Disney and Jennifer Anniston sink to a New Low,"In the movie ""The Millers"", Disney and Jennifer Anniston sink to a new low. For Disney to put their name on this movie is sad. The ""F"" word repeated over and over again is not comedy. The ""daughter"" told the flight attendant on the airplane trip to Mexico that she has missed her last few periods, and she doesn't know how that could be, since all she has done lately is anal sex. And the ""father"" trying to get his ""wife"" to give a corrupt Mexican policeman oral sex is also not comedy. Then when that fails, Disney thinks that the adult ""father"" trying to get his ""son"" to give a blow job to the Mexican policeman is the height of comedy. Jennifer Anniston ""acting in"" and lending her name to this film shows her little regard she has for herself now. And going around the country touting this movie and her stripping moves, without telling what the movie is really like, is false advertising. Parents who brought their children to see a Disney comedy got a terrible surprise. Needless to say, we walked out and got our money back, and I recommend that anyone else not even go in.

An Enjoyable Enough Comedy,"The script isn't the greatest here, but it is the cast that saves this from being bad.

Again, the jokes aren't the best - as with all comedies, there are some that land and some that don't - but it's the delivery of the jokes that makes them a lot funnier than they would be otherwise.

"""Millers"" takes lots of familiar comedy trappings and makes them into an entertaining original","The most effective comedies tend to be the ones you swear you've seen before yet you can't name any other just like it. ""We're the Millers"" has lots of familiar pieces but puts them together in a new-ish package. Often funny, sometimes hilarious and always amusing, ""Millers"" doesn't raise the bar for R-rated comedy, but it works the formula in all the right ways.The movie plays like a Farrelly brothers comedy, only it doesn't live and die by its jokes. There are some situational jokes involving awkward sexual situations, nudity and comedic violence, but what's more funny is the relationship dynamic between this ""family.""Jason Sudeikis, Jennifer Aniston, Will Poulter and Emma Roberts are the Millers, as well as a pot dealer, stripper, awkward loner and homeless runaway, respectively. After David (Sudeikis) gets rolled by some thugs, he owes his old college friend and wealthy employer, Brad (Helms), a ton of money. He can square up with Brad, but only if he goes into Mexico and smuggles in a shipment of pot for him. To do so inconspicuously, David recruits a ""family"" of equally desperate individuals and they set out for a Fourth of July ""RV trip"" in Mexico. Of course what starts easy ends up going south (no pun intended) in a hurry.These four actors are a pretty unusual group to begin with, though Aniston and Sudeikis both starred in ""Horrible Bosses."" Considering they all play degenerates of a sort who don't actually like each other, it makes their whole charade quite entertaining. The script could've played this premise out in really predictable fashion by sticking to typical family tropes, but Bob Faber and Steve Fisher (""Wedding Crashers"") along with Sean Anders and John Morris (""Hot Tub Time Machine"") take things a step further, crafting a lovable yet totally awful group of misfits who struggle to balance their personal motives with the idea of family spirit.""Millers"" doesn't completely steer clear of cliché territory and it sometimes plays off of homophobia for a few laughs, but it doesn't giggle at dirty humor and exploit its R rating in a way that seems fake like so many bad comedies do. The story acknowledges its outlandish premise early on and then just has fun with it, calling upon techniques used in road trip comedies, drug comedies, dysfunctional family comedies and more. Again, it's the idea of taking old tropes and building them into something more unique.The actors all really fit their parts. Aniston's move toward raunchier films still has her playing a type, but even though ""Millers"" exploits her for her sex appeal, she gets moments of ownership in the script, which doesn't paint her into a stereotype of a stripper character. Sudeikis does his thing and does it well with a bit more license to utilize his different strengths.Roberts does a good job changing perception of her character throughout the film, who sucks more than the others at the beginning, while Poulter is both lovable and hilarious as the clueless Kenny. Talents that are unusual and different like his (he doesn't fit a clear mold) can really take a typical comedy up a notch and he certainly adds something to this movie. Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn also provide top-notch supporting characters as a fellow RV couple.Despite their illegal purpose and somewhat self-centered motivations, it's pretty impressive how easy it is to like the Millers the family, not to mention the film as a whole. The script does a great job of clearly showing how all four of them desire something good in their lives; they each demonstrate a desire to live better lives and be better people. That helps make things interesting when they're thrown into your typical raunchy comedy tumult.""We're the Millers"" gets a lot of the small things right, and some of the credit needs to go to director Rawson Marshall Thurber (""Dodgeball"") who knows how to avoid the eye-rolling moments and to find some heart in spite of all the predictable comedic setup, in spite of knowing that even though they are doing this for money, the Millers will become somewhat of a family, or at least care about each other in the end.There are so many times in ""We're the Millers"" when it could've lapsed into same-old same- old R-rated, drug-related, sexual, foul-mouthed humor, and arguably it does, but the premise and the attention give to the characters helps it avoid the falls of so many similar comedies.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Much Better Than Expected,"David Burke is a pot dealer who is blackmailed into going to Mexico to pick up a big shipment of marijuana to smuggle back into the U.S. Realizing that a man travelling alone might draw attention, he asks his stripper neighbour Rose, naive teenage neighbour Kenny, and runaway punk girl Casey to tag along; together, they form ""The Millers"" family.""We're the Millers"" is a comedy movie that looks like it's not taking itself too seriously, but is actually very smart.It delivers funny and sarcastic lines, and features interesting characters.The latter are never one-dimensional; even the villains were likable, and minor ones have memorable lines ( ""You know what I'm sayin' ?

I lost IQ points,"I don't typically write reviews, but my outrage for this film could not go unheard.My friend and I decided on this film because it seemed like it had promise. Generally, before a film I'll check this site and read the ratings/reviews. Both appeared to be mostly positive, so naturally I was fuelled with excitement and optimism.The film is annoying, miscast, and screams desperation. The mundane script drags you and your intelligence through mud for what feels like eternity. If I kept tallies for the amount of times this movie made me cringe with irritating and misplaced references, my sheet would look like a prison cell from 1952.The jokes that jokes weren't even the worst part, to be honest. That honour goes to Nick Offerman and his wife played by Kathryn Hahn, who I am having difficulty describing without erupting in violent, vulgar shouting. Nick is okay, but whoever thought Kathryn's character was usable should never see a set again. I can't remember the last time I've been so physically and mentally irritated and frustrated with a cast, or film.The film itself has a fairly doable premise, I guess. But the cast, my god the cast. Why would they put Jason Sudeikis as a lead character? Why would you do that to us? He was great in Horrible Bosses, but you simply cannot have a film revolve around this man. He will disappoint you. Jen Aniston's character is ridiculous, as well. You take a women who was in one of the most loved and successful television programs of all time, and have her desperately cling to her stardom by stripping periodically throughout the film.It's like they never edited the film at all.

This is yet another inappropriate road trip movie. There are some hilarious moments and the group has fun chemistry. My only minor complaint is that Jennifer Aniston is more MILF than enjeunue.

The jokes were pretty funny and you grow to care about what happens to the characters, who were chosen well by the director. I also liked the fact that it wasn't predictable and it goes from one extreme to another. The out takes on the DVD shows that they had fun making the movie, which makes the chemistry between the characters great. It isn't realistic, but it is crazy humour which makes you stick with the movie until the end. Enjoyable!Round-Up: I was a bit worried when I saw Jennifer Aniston in this movie, but she played her part really well, along with the other characters in this film. Jason Sudeikis was great as the main character and I liked the other character that can into the movie along the way. The audiences must have enjoyed this movie, judging by the money that it made, and I think that it was well deserved because it could have easily drifted off into a buddy type of movie, which it definitely doesn't.

A surprisingly enjoyable family comedy,"We're the Millers is one of the entertaining, enjoyable, not-so-serious, formulaic but better comedy films out this year. (better than the abysmal Hangover 3) The story is simple: a drug dealer, a stripper, a troubled runaway and a virgin disguise as a fake happy family (on the assumption they will not get caught) on a road trip to Mexico to smuggle few tons of marijuana to the states. The film features a lot of amusing episodic misadventures during the journey (a ridiculous series of plot contrivances moves the film along), with consistent bickering (due to different backgrounds for each of the characters) and the eventual sentimental bonding between them.Despite the simplicity the plot, the film is well-acted and uplifted by a group of talented actors who tried their best to make it an entertaining film.It managed to offer some occasional laughs and smiles to the audience while feeling relaxed throughout the film.If you don't take it too seriously, lighten up and don't pick on the details of the film, you will find this family comedy enjoyable and worth the ride.The outtakes at the end of the film were quite good and fun to watch, especially a family sing-along scene in the van where they played ""I'll Be There For You"" (from F.R.I.E.N.D.S.), teasing Jennifer Aniston, from which she responds after smiling embarrassingly, 'That was very good.

'We're hilarious...but little else',"'We're the Miller's' is a terrible film but excellent comedy packed full of humour with incredibly likable characters meaning that this insensitive pile of senseless piece is actually quite entertaining and painfully funny!Jason Sudeikis is a small time drug dealer who owes his crack pot fellow dealer Brad (Ed Helms) a heap of cash (which he has just been mugged for and lost). In desperation he is sent on a wild goose chase by Brad to get him a ""smidge and a half"" size of marijuana from Mexico. In order to do this he gels together a quick ""family"" out of a stripper (Jennifer Aniston), a reckless young adult (Emma Roberts) and the innocent 18 year old (Will Poulter). On their journey they encounter a number of twists which threaten to tear this poorly patched together family apart!Sudeikis starred in 'Horrible Bosses' with Charlie Day and Jason Bateman and in my opinion this was a great example of how modern day comedy can be funny and have an entertaining plot. While 'We're the Millers' is no doubt funny, it lacks the excitement of 'Horrible Bosses' and and is a tad inferior to Sudeikis' previous work.Saying that - apparently Jason Bateman's recent comedy 'Identity Thief' hardly won rave reviews from the critics and when you compare this to some of Adam Sandler's stinkers and some of the drivel directors Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer have galvanised then its pretty good.Anniston is fabulous as Rose the stripper - in not just her acting - while Will Poulter is certainly becoming a rising star. He has shown experience in a variation of genres which make him a very versatile actor. Sudeikis is also good and Emma Roberts is sound. However, of all of the sub-cast I loved the cameo from Mark L. Young's Scotty P; for people who have watched it ""you know what I'm sayin'"" this for.Please don't watch this if your are a humourless bore because you will find nothing in the film to your taste except perhaps certain characters.

Very funny & very much worth seeing a few times at least. Sudeikis & Aniston are great but Kenny steals the show. I say B+,"""He's actually really cool, he's a drug dealer."" David Clark (Sudeikis) is a drug dealer who is great at his job. One night while trying to do the right thing he loses all he has. When his boss finds out he gives him a way to pay him back. All he has to do is move a ""smidge"" of pot across the Mexican border. Thinking that no one will stop a family in an RV he recruits a stripper, a homeless girl and a clueless boy and off they go. But it doesn't go as smooth as he expected. Comedies are the hardest to market I think. The goal of a trailer is to put enough in to make you want to see it but not give too much away. Most comedies fall into the trap of putting all the funny parts in the trailer and when you see the movie you are disappointed. While I would say that 80% of the trailers gives away all the funny parts the movie is still hilarious and very much worth seeing. Sudeikis is funny as always and Aniston is great in her role but the kid that plays Kenny really steals the movie and he is worth the price alone. There are some comedies that are funny the first time you see them then start to lose something with repeated watching. Some exceptions to me are Anchoman & Wedding Crashers. Those are funny every time I see them. While I don't think this is in the same class as those I still think it will be a long time before the humor is lost with repeated watching. Overall, very funny and very much worth seeing a few times at least. I give it a B+.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
An amazing comedy drama!!,"For all Jennifer Aniston fans out there, here is an amazing comedy drama movie with a great storyline. The direction is amazing as it character development is at a proper pace. A drug dealer makes a fake family to transfer drugs from Mexico all the way to his hometown. It is one of those movies which make you feel delighted. For people who loved FRIENDS, there is a surprise at the end of movie. But do watch the whole movie before jumping to the end. It is amazing to see that Jennifer Aniston despite being over 45 is still amazingly gorgeous. It is one of her most popular movies and is one of those movies where she plays a leading role unlike Horrible Bosses.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Who knew drug trafficking could be so hilarious...?,"""We're the Millers"" turned out to actually be a rather surprisingly nice comedy. I had initially just expected this to be another run-of-the-mill comedy that are found in abundance, but it turned out to be more than just so.The story is about a small time drug dealer named David (played by Jason Sudeikis) who has his supply of drugs and money stolen from him. To pay off his debt to his supplier Brad Gurdlinger (played by Ed Helms), he takes on a drug transporting job to smuggle a smidge and a half of weed over the Mexican/American border. In order to not arouse suspicion at the border, David needs to blend in and decides to be an all-American family, complete with wife, son, daughter and RV. He persuades his neighbor Rose (played by Jennifer Aniston), who is about to get evicted from her apartment to play the wife. And to play his son, he persuades Kenny (played by Will Poulter) who also lives in the same apartment building. And as the daughter he persuades a run-away girl named Casey (played by Emma Roberts).The situations that the 'family' finds themselves in are hilarious and they are so well constructed and there is a heap of laughs to be had throughout the movie. The dialogue is witty and lots of funny remarks and lines here.The movie was really well cast and the people were doing great jobs with their given roles. And the characters in the movie were really nicely detailed and fleshed out; lots of dimensions and aspects to them and their differences were great together for situational comedy.Once the movie has ended, be sure to remain seated and watched the bloopers and outtakes, because they are quite funny as well.As a side treat for those guys who are fans of Jennifer Aniston - for the obvious reasons - then there is a special performance to witness in the movie... just saying!""We're the Millers"" is well worth a watch if you enjoy comedy movies. Usually the great weed/pothead comedies are far between, but ""We're the Millers"" is right up there at the top of the list with the 2010 ""High School"" comedy with Adrien Brody in it. ""We're the Millers"" gets a 7 out of 10 rating from me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
worst film of 2013,"This movie was so depressingly awful, we reached for a copy of Flirting With Disaster to relieve the trauma suffered by watching 40 minutes of this assault on the brain and senses. It's squarely the screenplay's fault which seems to have been written in a playground one afternoon and shot the next day. How any actor with name recognition agreed to be in this suck fest is beyond me.The entire flow of the movie seems like a high school play, with one scene setting up an idiotic premise and the next scene fulfilling it as badly as possible. None of the characters is in any way believable Jason Sudeikis comes across like a yuppie in a Verizon commercial from the get-go when he's passed off as a drug dealer- a sourpuss, unlikeable jerk. Jennifer Aniston is capable, but I don't buy her as a stripper for a second. And that Fundamentalist- Christian outfit from 1992 she has to wear throughout this torture fest is just too painful to watch. Ed Helms doesn't have to be believable as a marijuana cartel guy (chuckle, yeah, right, marijuana), but his lines are just so unfunny. When the border agents beat an old hippie senseless and the Mexicans scurried away from under the bus, I had to turn it off. How insulting to the nation of Mexico. After viewing Despues de Lucia hours before this waste of time, a movie set in Mexico City, it's obvious Mexican filmmakers and the characters they depict have more class and finesse in their little finger than the writer and director of We're The Millers will have in a lifetime.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Cliché but Still Very Funny,"I love surprises for the most part and We're the Millers was a pleasant surprise. I saw trailers for this movie and it seemed like a typical summer comedy that would have a few laughs in far-fetched situations. Basically this is a typical summer comedy with a few laughs in many far-fetched situations. The only difference is the interesting premise. The movie starts out very cleverly. Jason Sudeikis plays a drug dealer who gets robbed so he has to make up for it by smuggling drugs from Mexico. He figures it will be easier if he has a fake family to ease the suspicion. That is very interesting and almost brilliant. It takes the family road trip cliché that has been done before and adds a twist.The twist was there but the clichés were also there and I really hoped they wouldn't have been. The drug dealer dad and stripper mom was great. It is something different and worked really well for the story but the cliché children were a little annoying. The tough and rugged sister was everything you expected with her adult humor and attitude. The brother was a sissy and added his own form of comedy that was also expected, but he was so funny. The brother stole the show and the family was believable.The clichés were there and the story was one that has been done time and time again. The family starts as opposites and they hate each other but slowly start to grow on each other comedically. Is this movie funny? Yes, the movie is very funny at moments. It isn't constant laughter but each scene brings out at least a chuckle. There are parts where the story slows down and it gets a little ridiculous with an obvious solution but it plays out in a way it probably should have. The cliché of all clichés in this movie is the other family.Why? Why does every movie with an RV involved have a crazy family in another RV in which the family constantly crisscrosses with? The other family was funny and probably necessary for the movie but they were so cliché. Some clever writing should have been in place instead of a story we have seen time and time again. This family took the good twist in the premise and diminished it. It was like the Purge. The clever premise disappears with the same old cliché. The family didn't destroy the entire movie but I sat in my chair and couldn't believe that I was watching a dirtier version of the Robin Williams movie RV.Sure a few things annoyed me with the characters and the story, but let's be honest; I went to see this movie to laugh. I laughed a lot during this movie a lot more than I thought I would to be honest. Will Poulter stole the show as the son of the family. Every scene is funny because of him. The best scene is when he sings Waterfall by TLC. He sings the one verse and I was rolling in my seat laughing. Then he is being taught how to kiss from Jennifer Aniston and Emma Roberts. Come on, that is hysterical and I was hoping there was a scene like that. This kid had no career before this movie but this will put him on the map. This kid has a bright future, mark my words.A major flaw in the movie was the marketing. A lot of the funny moments were shown in the trailers. This isn't the movies fault but I would have laughed more if I didn't see so much in the trailers. OK, this isn't going to be popular but I didn't think Jennifer Aniston was that sexy. That scene shown time and time again in every trailer did nothing for me. That is the scene where she is in her bra and panties but I didn't like it. It was over the top, forced, and I expected it to be later in the movie. This happens and then there is like another 45 minutes left. Don't get me wrong, Aniston was the perfect choice for the role and she did a great job but that one scene was too much.If I wrote this movie I would have done a thing or two differently. With the idea of sneaking in and out of Mexico I was looking forward to some chaos in Mexico with a lot of buildup to actually crossing the border. That didn't happen. They make it over and back over the border before any chaos even happens. It was a missed opportunity. This movie could have went in many different directions but again played into the clichés. Luckily they worked and it was still very entertaining. Was this movie how I wanted it to be? No. Was it funny enough for me to enjoy? Yes. Would I see it again? Probably not. Once was enough and I'm content. Don't expect me to buy it on blu ray or go out of my way to see it. It was good the first time but if it's on TV I'll give it another go. Other than that I'm done with the Millers.Overall, We're the Millers was a good time. I have no ""ragrets"" about seeing this movie and if you see it you should enjoy it. It had its obvious flaws but I was able to loom past them and enjoy a fun summer comedy. This movie is nothing more or less than a solid WillyT Recommendation. I give it a high recommendation. I liked more than I didn't like in this movie and the Millers were an entertaining bunch. They basically did their job.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Good But Raunchy,"I went to this with my Russian girlfriend not knowing what to expect but thinking Sudeikis and Aniston are usually pretty good. As hoped, they were both excellent. Ed Helms was also great as the big time drug lord. The constant satire of American middle class 'RVers' was hilarious and the 'Fitzgeralds' were classic with their excessive hospitality and cliché 'intimacy issues'. Some of the movie was very clever such as the Mexican cop scene, although the premise was rather crude. Had to explain terms like 'anal' and other sexual innuendo to my lady friend but it was fun to hear her giggle and laugh about what she missed. Worst part of the movie: the dumb rap by Will Poulter - couldn't wait for it to end. Plus we did not need to see the private parts of one of the male characters... I think they overdid the raunchy language, so if you are offended by 'F' words and so forth, avoid this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

The trailer and some extra bits,"I admit I mostly wanted to see the film because of the striptease bit in the trailer. And, while at her age Jennifer Aniston is pretty hot, the scene was singular and short. The rest of the film does have some merits, but also few and far between.The plot is that of a rather benign drug dealer (ahem!) who needs to do a crazy thing in order to stay alive, basically. He recruits a stripper, a juvenile delinquent and a hapless kid as a cover family. During the eventful trip, they come together as, well, a family. Now, you can imagine this script a thousand ways, one of them at least showing real people with real problems coming together when pressed by the outside world. This could have been a phenomenal dramedy, in my mind. Instead, it went for the brainless laughs, the cheap shots, the as predictable as completely unbelievable story and the lame ha-has to situations that are nothing to laugh about, like being mugged and almost killed, being asked by your employer to have sex with customers, being a socially isolated kid or a homeless adolescent girl with no adult supervision. Am I the crazy one or is it completely insane to know what is going to happen, even while being completely certain it would never ever happen in real life? Exactly what are we buying here?As a result, I could not empathize to any of the cartoonish characters and felt completely disconnected from any of the several amusing scenes in the film. As if being aware of this, the makers of the movie added a bit of bloopers at the end of the film, only those too felt staged and artificial.Rarely I try watching a comedy, hoping that I would be entertained, or trust a trailer to be a significant sample of a movie. Alas, most of the times I meet only disappointment. We're the Millers is clearly one of those times.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
No Ragrets,"I absolutely fell in love with this movie simply because it's nowhere close the movies you usually see in the cinema. I payed for the movie expecting the usual family story with a couple of fun scenes. I hadn't read the summary so I had no idea what it was all about. To say the truth, I was pleasantly surprised. The actors definitely fit the people they are playing and it's really beautiful. I don't want to spoil anything so I'll speak in general. The story line is something outstanding. It is so unbelievably crazy that it sucks you right in. It's something that shows you a totally different kind of life.Something crazy.Something extreme. And all that happening in a family van. It reminds me of Bethoven. No, not the composer-the movie.Only instead of a dog they were loaded with drugs. Some of these stuff are were so insane... so disturbing.It really drives your humor up a notch testing how uncomfortable you can get while still finding it hilarious.

There are moments that are far too implausible and many comedic moments taken directly from other comedies (Malibu's Most Wanted, Identity Thief, etc.) but overall, I am not disappointed that I spent $11 to see this film.

Not as funny as I thought it would be,"I have to say that, judging by the trailer, I was looking forward to this. It had a simple premise, i.e. a bunch of misfits masquerade as an 'all-American' family in order to smuggle drugs across the border from Mexico. Every step of the way I was waiting (and wanting!) it to get better, but it never really seemed to.Don't get me wrong - it's not terrible. I wasn't left feeling like I'd wasted nearly two hours of my life on it. However, there just weren't enough jokes in the film. Sometimes it felt like it was going whole scenes without anything funny happening and, when the jokes did come, they were a bit predictably and I felt like I'd seen them before in other films.It wasn't the actors' faults - they'll all good and they've all played better in other films - the film was just seemed like it was so meant to be funnier, yet didn't seem to pull it off. The film tries to add an element of danger by having the family pursued by real 'hard core' drug dealers, but the 'baddies' were only in a few scenes and every time they popped up, it had been so long since I last saw them, I practically forgot they were even in the movie! Yes, the (now infamous) 'Jennifer Aniston stripping scene' will always make the film stand out in the mind of many guys (embarrassingly, me included), but I'd have happily swapped it out for a few more decent jokes. The story deserved to be funnier, yet seemingly the best the writers can come up with is a big spider biting a guys on his...This is a film you'd probably want to rent over own.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Make Me Look like The Guy!,"Jason Sudeikis and Jennifer Aniston play a drug dealer and exotic dancer who pose as suburban parents of teenagers to smuggle in drugs from Mexico. The film includes two awkward teenagers. Emma Roberts and Will Poulter play Casey and Kenny. The cast is first rate and the writing is above average. I enjoy watching Ed Helms as the boss. Luis Guzman deserved better in his small role. Kathryn Hahn and Will Offernan play another couple on vacation. This vacation movie reminds me of the National Lampoon's Vacation more so. Despite them playing a family on the road, they clicked well together. They take a plane from Denver to Tuscon and then rent a massive RV to Mexico. The direction is pretty good. The film has some slow moments but it's worth watching. Jennifer Aniston can pull off as an exotic dancer than her normal girl next door appearance.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Hilarious,"One of the few newer comedies that is worth the watch. It's so hard to find a really good comedy, but this one did a great job.The story is a take it or leave it one, but the cast is what really makes this film shine. Putting together an odd cast of characters and having them act like the perfect family is the perfect recipe for a comedy. The nerdy innocent virgin, the homeless naughty girl, the hot sexy stripper and a petty drug dealer that cares about no one or anything. Its just down right funny.Not only were the characters perfectly written and portrayed but the cast chosen was a perfect fit for those roles. Jennifer Austin gives quite the show of her beautiful body and sexy attitude throughout the move. As per usual Jason Studeikis is the perfect amount of funny and has great chemistry with Jennifer Austin.

"Yet another raunch-com that tries to be vulgar and sweet, this fitfully amusing road trip movie has some laugh-out-loud parts that make up for an otherwise mediocre whole","Ever since ""The Hangover"" and ""Bridesmaids"" convinced Hollywood that there was an audience hungry for R-rated comedies, it's been one profanity-laced affair after another, the latest addition to the line this loosely scripted but well-acted raunch-com 'We're the Millers'. Foul-mouthed though it may be, this is like those earlier two movies a slice of vulgar vanilla - and by that we mean a movie that will in the end stick to formula to deliver a crowd-pleasingly safe happily-ever- after ending.Coined by the team behind the very funny ""Wedding Crashers"" - Bob Fisher and Steve Faber - and polished by the duo who crafted ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" - Sean Anders and John Morris, there's no denying that its premise has comic promise. The joke here is that ""the Millers"" are but an invention of the small-time middle-aged pot dealer David (Jason Sudeikis) - consisting of a stripper named Rose (Jennifer Aniston), a local runaway named Casey (Emma Roberts) and his young neighbour named Kenny (Will Poulter) - who hatch a plan to recruit a fake family as cover for one major score.David owes money to his supplier Brad (Ed Helms), and in return for erasing his debt, he is forced to drive to Mexico to smuggle a whole shipment of marijuana over the border. Playing obviously to stereotypes, David's plan rests on the assumption that a wholesome-looking white- bread family in an RV is less likely to be stopped and inspected for drugs. That's the setup for a twisted road trip made up of episodic misadventures, consistent bickering and finally of course the obligatory sentimental uplift - is it any surprise that by the end of the movie, the bunch of misfits actually become the all-American family they spend most of their time before mocking?But such is a movie where the destination is probably less important than the journey itself, and ""Dodgeball"" director Rawson Marshall Thurber manages enough fitfully amusing gags to make taking this trip worthwhile. A recurring one which the four writers and Thurber milk for maximum hilarity has the Millers running into fellow RV-ers Don and Edie Fitzgerald (Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn) along with their teenage daughter Melissa (Molly Quinn), whom are the exact sort of family the Millers are pretending to be - not only do the adults end up almost having a foursie, Kenny is also caught ""kissing"" his sister and then his mother by the very girl (i.e. Melissa) that he is taking such lessons for in the first place.The rest of the best bits are unfortunately already in the trailer, though seeing Kenny demonstrate his way around TLC's ""Waterfalls"" and getting bit where it matters by an errant tarantula still yet again remains pretty amusing. That should probably also clue you in that there are quite a number of jokes that miss their mark - in particular, one where David asks Kenny to perform sexual favours on a corrupt Mexican cop (Luis Guzman in a cameo) to avoid arrest just feels wrong. A subplot that sees two double-crossed Mexicans - One-Eye (Matthew Willig) and Pablo (Tomer Sisley) - hot on the trail of the Millers also offers little payoff even after they finally confront the Millers.What the material lacks, the cast however try their darnest to make it for it. Sudeikis strikes a nice balance between being appealing and obnoxious, while Aniston puts her 44-year-old-but-not-looking-any-of-it hot bod to good use especially in showcasing the stripper moves she picked up for this movie. Poulter is surprisingly sweet and likable as the shy virgin, though Roberts looks too demure to be a runaway rebel. Deserving of special mention here are Offerman and Hahn, the two veterans quite nearly stealing the show with their square-seeming behaviour that one only sees through when the Millers decide to pay them an unannounced visit in their tent in the middle of the night.And thanks to the game cast, what is in fact an utterly mediocre script for an inspired high-concept comedy turns out passably entertaining. At no point does it reach the comedic heights of 'The Hangover' or 'Bridesmaids' - or for that matter even 'Wedding Crashers' and 'Hot Tub Time Machine'; instead, it offers occasional laughs for those looking for some naughty fun, but will most likely disappoint those hoping for anything more. If you happen to be catching it though, make sure you stay for the outtakes - there's a bit which references Aniston's time in F.R.I.E.N.D.S. that makes for the perfect sendoff.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
refreshingly astute Hollywood comedy,"""We're the Millers"" is that rarest of cinematic creatures - a high-concept Hollywood comedy that actually works.Jason Sudeikis from ""Saturday Night Live"" plays a small-time drug dealer who's sent by his skeevy drug lord (Ed Helms) to Mexico to pick up a shipment of marijuana. In order to avoid arousing any unwanted suspicion at the border, David rents an oversized RV and hires a motley crew of acquaintances to pose as his all-American family. These include a down-on-her-heels stripper posing as his wife (Jennifer Aniston); a hard-edged, homeless girl standing in as his daughter (Emma Roberts); and a big-hearted dork from the neighborhood assuming the role of his son (Will Poulter).The story is fraught with any number of comical misadventures as David and his unlikely troupe encounter armed-to-the-teeth bad guys and another family (led by Kathryn Hahn and ""Parks and Recreation's"" Nick Offerman) in an equally ostentatious RV along the way.What separates ""We're the Millers"" from so many other recent studio-manufactured comedies is the sharpness of the writing and the appealing nature of the characters. The script maintains a deft balance between subtle wit and blatant slapstick, modern-day crudity and old-fashioned sweetness. And even in those rare moments when the movie jumps the track, it's quick to climb right back on and head on to its destination.Much of the credit for the movie's success goes to the actors who create tremendously likable characters, all with their own comic quirks and eccentricities, but all rooted, at least to some extent, in real life. The real scene-stealer is Poulter whose spot-on portrayal of a lovable nerd serves as the beating heart of the movie.So effective in fact are the actors in getting us to root for the characters that the movie can play up the whole corny and sentimental notion of what it means to be a family and get away with it. Thus, it manages to keep its subversive cred while at the same time warming the heart. That's a pretty impressive accomplishment when you get right down to it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"""Miller time got interrupted by irrelevance.""","It's good to see an original film come once in a while but even with that there's always going to be some part of the writing that doesn't make sense or work at all. In this film, we're primarily focused on four different characters that are partnered together in a drug-smuggling ring for money and personal satisfaction. Of course, as a road-trip film, there's always going to be some constant complications between the relationships and situations everyone embarks into.With most of the film being straightforward and self-aware, there's also parts where it becomes disjointed and too prolonged with nonsense. While most of the film has humor, action, and suspense set in the right place, it quickly becomes a hassle to await for the execution. Like most films, the cast and crew bring their fullest performances and provides a vast and subjective presentation for everyone, but it doesn't mean all viewers will be satisfied.Even though some viewers may enjoy this, it doesn't change that there could have been so much more to this that once again failed in almost the rest of the film when you think it could get crazier.

It's funny; know what i'm sayin'???,"Wasn't expecting a lot from this one; i knew it would be funny but i didn't expect to enjoy it as much as i did.Story is basic and simple enough, a drug dealer (Jason Sudeikis)-due to a bad turn of events- has to turn to smuggling in order to repay a debt. He enlists the help of a stripper (Jennifer Anniston), a dense virgin (Will Poulter) and a homeless rebel (Emma Roberts) to create a fake family in order to accomplish that. And from there chaos ensues.It is full of quick witted, snappy one liners. Hilarious scenarios and added to that a real feel good factor pops in and out of the film. As i said i had an inkling it was going to be funny, due to Jason Sudeikis. He just has this ability to make you laugh by doing anything; a facial expression, his delivery, his timing. He, for me, is the star of the show as David Clark. But that in no way takes away from the rest of the ""family""...well 2 of them anyway. Jennifer Anniston is excellent as Rose; she's funny, wild and does a good job at keeping up with Sudeikis' lightning fast wit. And as for Poulter's role as Kenny; well if ever there was an actor cast perfectly for a role, this may well be it; flawless display. Roberts' role as Casey was good, but it didn't come close to the other 3.

Pass the Popcorn review,"Here's something I never thought I'd see again: a funny modern comedy. Because of the horrendous Movie 43 and all those Adam Sandler shits everyone seems to love, mainstream comedy is a genre I'd suggest to avoid, even if it has an amazing cast - unless it was filmed at least 20 years ago. But We're the Millers, surprisingly, manages to be an exception and makes you laugh easily. Even though its director isn't well known, and the cast features only a few famous actors, We're the Millers shows filmmakers something they should never have forgotten: to make a great comedy it really takes nothing else than good jokes and a good script. Are you taking notes, Adam Sandler? David Clark (Jason Sudeikis) is a successful pot dealer who, one evening, is robbed of all his drugs and money. The next day he's kidnapped and brought to Brad Gurdlinger (Ed Helms), a rich drug lord whom David owes money. Brad forces David to smuggle marijuana from Mexico in order to erase his debt. Realising him going alone would cause suspicion, David convinces a stripper (Jennifer Aniston), a young runaway (Emma Roberts) and his teenage neighbor (Will Poulter) to come along and pretend to be his wife and kids.The premise of this movie is pretty obvious and not too original: it's about a dysfunctional (and, in this case, fake) family in which everyone hates each other until they end up realising they are almost perfect for each other. You also learn that ""all you need is love"" and ""no one likes to be alone"" and all that sentimental stuff. But, interestingly, We're the Millers succeeds in making something so obvious come up as fresh and new. Even though we know that will happen - it must, it's a comedy! - this doesn't make the movie boring or predictable. This might sound contradictory, but the only thing you really do see coming is the happy end, and that's just because We're the Millers follows the standard comedy pattern - as it should. This again confirms what I said before: to make a good comedy you just need a good script and good jokes. And the jokes are good - unexpectedly, since they are mostly based on dirty words and slapstick humour.The characters are very well developed and work good together. Although Jennifer Aniston is way more famous than anyone else in this movie, you never think of that, as the movie doesn't focus on her, and consequently doesn't forget there are other, equally important characters in this movie. This also helps turn the protagonists themselves into good jokes: sure, they are somewhat stereotyped, but in a truly funny way. Ed Helms is fantastic as the rich and spoiled drug lord, even though he gets little screen time: you hate him as soon as he opens his mouth! Emma Roberts as the angry teenager, and Will Poulter as the 18 year-old who's never been kissed, are both remarkable. As you can easily understand, the movie's best quality is the ability to make old, stereotyped, already-seen humour funny again. Do not trust the cocky, wannabe-intellectual critics on Rotten Tomatoes and their bad ratings - this is truly a movie worth seeing that will make you laugh!Rating: 7/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
funny,"Definitely a film which belongs under the must watch section. so funny had me in stitches its witty,clever, funny, excitable. if you love comedy films then this is just the film for you. A well matched / unmatched family forced to do something to keep their heads a float. Great name for a great film. Seen this so many times now.Just cant stop watching it. It has just become one of my favourite films of all time. Perfect for any audience over the age of say 15 due to the drug nature in this film. anything with Jennifer Aniston is worth a watch in my eyes even if it was rubbish which it wasn't. 10 out of 10 from me. as previously described 'so dumb yet so funny' i agree completely. you will be surprised about how much you will laugh at this real film. its a bit like real life in so many ways but so funnier.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Good For Some Laughs,This is a decent comedy featuring Jason Sudekis as a drug dealer looking to settle a debt by becoming a drug smuggler. Jennifer Aniston and Emma Roberts are hired to play his family as he crosses the Mexican border. Not hysterical but funny at spots. Aniston has some of the best laughs. Cute dynamic between the characters. It had a National Lampoon's Vacation vibe.,6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

A Fun But Heavily Flawed Romp,"""We're the Millers"" is a film aiming to be an unconventional and irreverent R-rated comedy and somehow missed its margin by a devastatingly huge amount. The events that happen in this picture should be grounds for genius comedic situations and fresh dialogue snapping one great line after another. Unfortunately, what we get is a lumbering comedy that relies too much on clichés, even despite the fact that the movie clearly wants to be different and edgy. A fake-out family road trip to smuggle a surplus of weed is essentially the plot of the film. I could think of a million funny family satire that could have spawned from that idea. But fortunately, this movie uses on some occasions, very clever moments of inspired comic genius. There aren't enough of them, but whenever a joke hits in this movie, it hits pretty hard. I enjoy a nice big laugh in a movie, even within a movie thats not all that great. I have to say, i loved the choice of casting. It really can't get much better than the people they chose to be the Millers. Jason Sudeikis plays his charming average joe character so playfully, you honestly can't help but fall in love with whatever he does. Jennifer Aniston is well.. the most perfect woman to ever grace the earth (one man's opinion obviously). Even Ed Helms gets in a couple of yuks! So it goes without saying, We're the Millers is not a bad movie. Its actually worth your while in watching.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"Horrible acting, weak story line, poorly written comedy","The comedic writing for this movie was weak to say the least, with a few funny lines and then fillers. The movie was so jam packed with stupid clichés, the ditzy Mother who has lesbian fantasies, the DEA agent with the good heart, the kids who just want a normal family. All tired old junk used countless times before.Jason Sudeikis is not a lead actor either. He has 2 facial expressions. Jennifer Aniston once again proves what a useless unfunny actress she really is. Her only redeeming quality is her body which is shown gratuitously. Neither of these two have enough screen presence to carry a comedy.

Enough Laughs to Make It Worth Watching,"We're the Millers (2013)*** (out of 4)A low-level drug dealer (Jason Sudeikis) hires a stripper (Jennifer Aniston), a punk (Emma Roberts) and a dork (Will Poulter) to be his ""family"" so that he can sneak in and out of Mexico with a large amount of marijuana. Obviously, there's one trouble after another, which leads to plenty of laughs. WE'RE THE MILLERS is a good but not great comedy. It certainly wasn't the laugh riot I was hoping for but when the laughs are on the mark they're strong enough to make the film worth sitting through. I'll get the negative comment out of the way first and that's the fact that many of the jokes just seem to fall a little short of their punchline. In other words, several times I thought the jokes really could have delivered more had they crossed a certain line but instead of doing so they took a safe way out and the laughs weren't as big as they could have. When the film works best is when it really starts to go ""naughty"" and this includes a hilarious sequence where the ""mother"" and ""sister"" teach the little brother how to properly kiss. Another excellent sequence takes place in a tent when a new friend wants to get a little close to Aniston's breasts. The film benefits from four very good performances that really make you feel like this is a fake family on the run from a variety of characters. All four actors do a very nice job in their roles and this is especially true for Poulter and Roberts as the children. And yes, Aniston has a very hot body for the stripper role but don't expect her to cross the line of nudity. The film moves along at a pretty good pace but I must admit that it started to run a tad bit too long. Still, there are enough laugh here to make the film worth watching and the four leads are so good together I doubt many would complain if a sequel was to follow.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
solid summer road trip movie,"I've seen both films released locally on my birthday, August 9th, and while I felt that ""Elysium"" was a long mile better than ""Total Recall,"" released last year on August ninth, I must admit, in spite of all my reservations before entering the theater,""...Millers"" deserved a Fourth-of-July weekend release. I mean, who decides these things. It's obvious, too, it's got legs, more than what Aniston can offer, as it had earned over 90 million as of the latest box office figures, while ""Elysium,"" probably getting as many or more screens, had faded to 69 mil'.And given the obvious Fourth-of-July tie in for the first of three climaxes, all of which are good, it's just bizarre to me that this film was pushed back to August 9th, where they release the films that are second tier at best.Granted, Aniston is about as believable as a stripper as she would be as a country singer or secret agent, but, she shines in so many other areas of comedic ensemble, deliver-the-line-and-get-out-of-there acting that she has honed over the decades, that one can easily forgive her stereotyped stripper moves. Sudeikis is given more of a chance to flex his considerable talent, and he is truly believable in every aspect of his character. This film is a solid step forward for him in an already impressive comedic career.As with most road movies, the plot twists and turns require more than a little leap of faith, but our genuine caring for all four of the ""Millers"" makes us want to stretch out our suspension-of-disbelief the extra long summer highway mile. Wacky, warm, gross, guttural, shocking (and it takes a lot to shock me) fun that's like pure carnival cotton candy. Melts in the mouth, empties the brain pan, and I get to forget all about it after it's gone.Take the one hour and forty minute ride. I can tell when I like a movie. Unlike ""Elysium,"" after ""The Millers,"" I stayed for all the credits, and left the theater with a little spring in my step.Excellent work from a great cast plus good writing and direction. Now someone tell me why it was pushed back to an August release? Was it just too much fun for the Fourth? Producers surely lost some money out of the gate by holding it back. I'm sure it will continue to earn overseas and in rental and HD. But the accountants should not have ""counted to three"" on its release.So here's a tarantula on your balls. Only summer movie I have really liked so far. ""Millers"" is lite but satisfying.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
It's just your average drug smuggling road trip in We're The Millers,"The rated R comedy is one that either really pushes the limits and succeeds or just falls apart. The latest brings Horrible Bosses stars Jason Sudeikis and Jennifer Aniston back together once again letting Aniston unleash her inner sex symbol, but does deliver more than that and go above and beyond or is all the funny in the trailer?We're the Millers follows a pot dealer who is forced to move a huge shipment of weed from Mexico to the U.S. In order to divert attention of the law he takes up with a stripper, a homeless girl, and a geeky kid that lives next door to create a fake family on vacation. The trailer was funny, but this movie is even funnier that it lets on. The beginning of the film struggles a bit and looked as though it was going to be a dud, but once they hit the road things pick up and finds its stride. This cast has some great chemistry as both friends and enemies as things progress. The film is somewhat of reminiscent of National Lampoon's Vacation, with Sudeikis delivering a similar deadpan character that works really well, especially when he begins to lose it. Aniston showcases her comedy chops and really let's lose as well as delivering one of her sexiest characters to date. Emma Roberts and Will Poulter are great as the ""kids"" but it's Poulter he really steals most of the scenes. His character is so innocent and confused that he is a laugh riot. The real treat of the whole film is the inclusion of the always great Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn whose uptight strange family creates a camping experience for them all that steals the film. Ed Helms, who is usually great, isn't given all that much to do and feels a bit miscast at times, but still manages to entertain.With any film like this there is some heart to the story that does keep it from ever going as far as it could have, but it still manages to create one of the funniest R rated comedies to come along in a while. There are numerous moments that are over the top and unbelievable on some level, but they all fit the formula to make a film like this work.

"Simple, no-brainer with sufficient laughs & the best balls on screen this year.","When small-time dope dealer, David (Jason Sudeikis), is robbed of his stash and cash he is forced to undertake a dug smuggling run for his boss, Brad (Ed Helms), to bring a small quantity of marijuana across the Mexican border. He recruits stripper Rose (Jennifer Aniston), geek Kenny (Will Poulter) and homeless dropout Casey (Emma Roberts) to be his clean-cut 'family' for the trip but what looks to be a milk run rapidly descends into dangerous farce when the 'package' fills their RV.We're the Millers is a comedy of recompense where Sudeikis goes some way to making amends for his inexplicable appearance in the execrable Movie 43 while Aniston restores our confidence in her ability after her lukewarm flop, Wanderlust. There's not a lot of depth, it's a ridiculous premise with dubious morals that you know from the outset Hollywood will feel the need to temper but, you know what? It's funny! From the trailer We're the Millers gives the impression of being the hilarious sleeper hit that The Hangover was in 2009. Alas, it falls far short of that but Helms is on his best form since his big screen breakout hit and it works as a simple, no-brainer Friday night flick.Sudeikis holds the film together as the selfish manchild with some deeply hidden morals and is wonderfully deadpan when the mania around him needs to be played down. Aniston gets to be both sexy and bitchy while playing the mumsy role and Roberts has the opportunity to pout and give her 'mum' a run for her money.The funniest moments, however, come courtesy of Poulter who's come a long way since his debut, Son of Rambow. His Kenny is embarrassing, nerdy, sincere and very funny at times presenting us with plenty of opportunities to cringe or wince at his expense. Oh, and he has the honour of owning the funniest balls seen on the big screen this year so far.There are plenty of enjoyable cameos from Helms, Luis Guzmán (as a Mexican cop) and Nick Offerman, Kathryn Hahn and Molly Quinn as the RV-freaky Fitzgerald family ensuring We're the Millers ambles along at an enjoyable pace and providing sufficient laughs to keep the attention.Unfortunately, there is too much reliance on old jokes badly reworked and pretty obvious scenarios for We're The Millers to be anything more that a fun evening and a distant recollection, but it is fun, you WILL laugh and it's worth a small amount of effort.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

What kind of comedy is this supposed to be?,"I'm fairly picky when it comes to comedies so I didn't expect much from this one.

A ""feel good"" comedy? A buddy/group comedy?It can't ever figure it out and sort of hops between styles never getting a real fit.Most of the funny moments are of the ""HAH"" variety and over very quickly and then you're stuck waiting 5 to 10 minutes for the next brief ""HAH"" moment.It does have a classic scene that is hilarious and while it doesn't save the movie, its amazing and you'll know which one it is when you see it.The movie feels every bit of its hour and fifty minutes and I found the outtakes at the end to be as funny as the whole of the movie put together.Its just simply not my thing and I partially feel that way because I think it could have been an excellent dark comedy.

Also, a lot of dumb scenes, like taking the drugs from unknown place,stupid talks with the other camping family, ""mom-sister-brother"" kissing scenes... At a moment, you see loosers trying to earn some money, and the other moment they act like a family. After all, when everything's OK ""like a movie"" the police actually gives a chance for the dealer and he takes the money from the drugs....and they live happy to the end of their stupid lives like a family.

"Better than I was expecting if predictable, some genuine laughs though","This was actually pretty funny, better than I was expecting and definitely had its moments. I went in anticipating ""dumb"" though so in that respect I wasn't disappointed and ultimately enjoyed my ride along with the Millers.The storyline and set up (while preposterous) at least managed to feel somewhat original, following Jason Sudeikis as a low level pot dealer who is forced to retrieve a ""tiny"" drug shipment from Mexico in order to pay off his supplier after he gets robbed. He then finds and agrees to pay a stripper (Jennifer Aniston as eye candy but she does it well) and two misfit teens to portray his family as cover for his RV drug trafficking trip.Unfortunately its in the execution that this movie fails because the way events play out are completely cliché.

Sticks out like a sore tes...thumb.,"What do they say about too many cooks? WE'RE THE MILLERS is a comedy penned by four screenwriters. Two of them, Bob Fisher and Steve Faber also wrote the occasionally hilarious WEDDING CRASHERS. The other two writers, Sean Anders and John Morris were responsible for the tasteless and unnecessary HOT TUB TIME MACHINE. And putting all this together is director Rawson Marshall Thurber, whose best movie so far is the mediocre brat pack DODGEBALL: A TRUE UNDERDOG STORY. See where I'm going with this? To make a long story short, WE'RE THE MILLERS is a no-brainer comedy filled with moments that lack taste and tact. But if you prefer to switch-off from reality, especially after a bad day at work, there are plenty of insane tidbits to make you laugh.On the short end of the stick, the film does have one redeeming quality and that is the casting. Last seen together in the not so horrible HOBBIBLE BOSSES, Jason Sudeikis and Jennifer Aniston are pitted together as neighbors who don't get along. In fact Sudeikis' David doesn't get along with any of his neighbors – Kenny (Will Poulter) an 18-year-old nerd who hasn't even kissed a girl, Casey (Emma Roberts) a homeless Goth-chick, and Rose (Aniston) a debt ridden stripper. Comprising of chaotic moments strung together in the form of a road-trip, the over marinated premise has David downgraded from small-time drug dealer to a mule. After losing his cash and stash, David owes his boss big time and is forced to smuggle ""a smidge and a half"" of dope from Mexico into Denver. Sure enough, David does the most sensible thing and recruits the aforementioned neighbors to masquerade as the titular family on vacation. What his boss Brad (Ed Helms of HANGOVER fame) fails to do is define the word 'Smidge', resulting in a faux pas road trip with the most dysfunctional family onboard a RV.While the setup might seem original at first, the gags and corny one-liners catch up to leave you with a high level of clichéd predictability. More often than not, the Millers find themselves flying out of the frying pan and into the fire due to unexpected predicaments. These situations are frequent but also sugar coated with coincidental salvation in the nick of time. Hence, whatever situation lies waiting, the Millers will find a way around it or through it, but in a manner that will leave you either chuckling in delight or grimacing in disgust. Each of the actors playing the Millers is also tasked with a characteristic personality trait that underscores the film's R-rated content advisory. Somehow, this is built into the array of jokes while also allowing the audience to root for at least one of these misfits. While Sudeikis is his goofy self all throughout, Roberts meets her match with an Eminem wannabe called Scottie P. and Aniston switches from exotic dancer to suburban housewife in the blink of an eye. On the other hand, British actor Poulter can be credited for some of the heavier laughs even if these scenes are literally made of below-the-belt humor.Thurber keeps things moving, if not alternated by moments straight out of a Farrelly Brothers movie. Some characters are in just for kicks (Luis Guzman as an improvised Mexican cop) while others appear contrived and repetitive (Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn as a weird pair of swingers). For this reviewer, the best laughs are the most natural and these are saved for the end-credits sequence where actors are themselves. Did I mention Jennifer Aniston plays a stripper? If all else fails, watching Aniston do her thing is worth the price of admittance alone.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Pleasant comedy movie,"We're The Millers is a great movie, if you're looking to spend about 2 hours just laughing out into thin air. It gives a good premise and delivers the jokes perfectly, from that premise. With the kind of characters presented in the movie, one could only get these funny situations. All the main roles, plus a solid supporting turn from Ed Helms contribute to the movie's appeal and only make it better.So in a nutshell, long-time pot dealer David Clark asks a group of misguided people to create a fake family with him, in order to smuggle a shipment of weed from Mexico to the U.S. He offers compensation for the job, given the danger involved. However when he finds out that his boss was actually stealing from a Mexican drug lord, David must find a way to survive, while also learning to cope with this strange group of people pretending to be a family. Between a stripper, a virgin and a runaway, we get a strong comic dynamic which I felt was well explored. Anniston shows once again why she is still a strong name in comedy and Poulter gives a standout role as the bumbling teenager that always seems too naive. Still my favorite of the bunch is Sudeikis, as he always plays these parts right on the money.We're The Millers is a crude and sometimes inappropriate comedy movie. In my estimation, it does a great job with the laughs, even if the story does get a bit sappy at the end (as most movies do anyway).

Love Aniston,"The ""family"" we see on screen for most of the surprisingly high 109 minute runtime is in a lot of ways funny, in some ways disgusting, and in a few ways charming. The film just works with the pairing of Sudeikis and Aniston, as we saw for a tiny bit in Horrible Bosses, which to me is one of the funniest movies in a long while. If you liked Wedding Crashers, or Hot Tub Time Machine, chances are you'll like this one, which was written by the 4 screenwriters who worked on those films. The 2 pairs of writers who have a history with comedy throw some subtle humor in the dialog which you probably won't get if you're not paying enough attention, which allows for every comedy lovers dream: To be laughing out loud, then hearing an ever so subtle joke causing you to laugh harder, then hearing another one and another and another. The film was consistently funny in a sense that when it got me, it REEALLLY got me.Overall, the film is just a slight bit lovable, with characters you actually kinda like...not too common for a modern comedy.

"From Friends, to family","After watching 'We're the Millers', I came to the realisation that Jennifer Aniston has had the most success out of the main cast of popular 90′s show 'Friends' after it went off air in 2004. Whilst David Schwimmer directs and occasionally lends his voice to animations such as 'Madagascar', most have rarely been on the big-screen since, perhaps peaking with the sit- com.Whilst Aniston never veers far from her portrayal as Rachael when acting in most roles, it seems to have been a winning formula for her as she stars in a mixture of romantic comedies. In terms of putting aces in places, 'We're the Millers' excels at placing their actors as characters best suited to them which really helps pack the humour with an extra punch.When local pot dealer, Dave (Jason Sudeikis), is robbed of his drug dealers money and stash he finds himself forced by his boss to smuggle a 'smidgen' of weed across the Mexican border with a family he assembled, as compensation, purposefully finding people to fit every family stereotype. The teenage girl with an attitude (Emma Roberts), the awkward son (Will Poulter) and the loved up wife (Aniston). Their motives for joining his escapades vary from being an out of luck stripper to a runaway child. Soon, things get out of control as they jump in a recreational vehicle, leaving a trail of madness in their wake. Along the way they are pursued by a drug cartel and meet a family of three who they repeatedly cross paths with.The film reminded me of a more adult re-imagining of the 2006 Robin Williams outing, 'R.V' and whilst the Williams movie was based around him trying to bring his family closer together again this road trip was more of a personal journey for all involved in this film. Although it was obvious where the plot would go in the sense of the protagonist being a single, lonely drug dealer finding his missing link, the journey throughout was light and, at times, sentimental yet not overbearingly so as it kept the gags rolling thick and fast.Despite Ed Helms being popular due to his recent achievements in 'The Hangover' trilogy I couldn't help but imagine Bob Odenkirk of Breaking Bad fame (Better Call Saul!) being the most ideal match for the part of Brad Gurdlinger. Maybe this is just down to my current addiction to that specific series yet Helms still performs well as the dirty drug dealer.Additionally, the sporadic use of many references to popular television and films help to elevate the humour such as mentions to 'Dexter' and Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight Rises', both immensely prominent in their respective mediums.Regardless of the fact that some of the wisecracks are predictable. Some are pleasantly unanticipated as the family find themselves in odd situations that have laughable, unexpected resolutions including a scene where Aniston proves she's 'still got it'.

The (okay but not fantastic) story brought forth some unforgettable moments. I also liked that each character was explored or ""had something"". You didn't feel that one character was just there to be there, you know? Each character brought their moments and background and by doing so, claimed to be essential for the plot and fun.Overall I would recommend this movie for a cozy night in front of the TV with some friends or partner, with the intention to have a laugh. Be sure to be okay with jokes about drugs & sex and some profanity (as seen in the trailer).",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A truly unexpected and quite underrated gem of a comedy,"Given the circumstances involved, and the total compartment of it all within one film, there is no way We're the Millers should work as a film, and yet it does, and it pulls it off wonderfully. The film is packed with truly hilarious gags, that may be unforgettable to watch from time to time, but is an absolutely insane experience to watch and enjoy. All the actors involved I thought were great, especially Aniston and Poulter who have a nice time to shine from their usual roles. The film never really lets up, which may seem like a problem said offhand like that, but in reality, watching it, it is an absolutely entertaining ride that is truly enjoyable through and through. The casting is perfect, and without the exact people in the roles allotted, it may seem a lot messier, but luckily the cast is there to tie it all together, and they do a splendid job of doing so. In the end, We're the Millers may seem like a ridiculous film of situational comedy, but it is always very entertaining, and though not every moment might land perfectly, it is certainly a joy to watch.

Pretty Good! Surprisingly...,"I was surprised how much the movie affected me. I actually walked away with a good feeling inside! We're the Millers balances crude humor with a legitimate good story about people's innate need of socialization. It literally spins RV on its head. The story was actually decent and pretty well written to a certain extent. The only thing was the humor is crude. However, keeping in mind who is in the movie, I didn't find this surprising. I would recommend watching this with friends and maybe, if they are old enough, family members. I would also consider watch it on a Friday night. Overall, a generous 6 out respect for the message and the plot.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
I want my money back,"I'm not sure if I'm getting old and losing my sense of humor or I'm getting old and I've finally realized it takes more than sexist, rude, crude and crass comedy to entertain me. If being completely honest I'd like to think that I even in my younger days I still would not have found this funny as the majority to seem to. It seems as though I've finally found a film where I am out voted. We're the Millers is a story about how being wrong and soulless can lead to a deserving life. Jason Sudeikis (Horrible Bosses, Hall Pass) plays David Clarke a local neighborhood drug dealer dealing to everyone from the tidy business man down to the local thugs. He's not exactly big time money but earns enough to keep him happy. After being robbed by a couple of teen rough nuts he is pretty much told he needs to pay back the big boss or die, he must go to Mexico and pick up a small amount of herbs to repay his debt and clear his name. Knowing all too well that getting across the border in a RV by himself will cause a lot of suspicion he enlists the help of a stripper neighbor named Rose played by Jennifer Aniston (Horrible Bosses, Friends), and two others to play his kids. One his 18yr old never been kissed neighbor Kenny played by Will Poulter (The Maze Runner, School of comedy) and the other a teenage runaway named Casey played by Emma Roberts (American Horror Story, Valentine's Day). Together the foursome set out on their road trip to Mexico ready to play happy families to get through the boarders security with a nice big payload at the end This movie is wrong on so many levels, Jennifer Aniston really needs to hang her head in shame here, it was a disaster from beginning to end with some of the most absurd dialog I have ever heard in a comedy. Jennifer playing a stripper for a start was ridiculous, yes she is quite hot and knows how to move her body but her character was such a mess I swear the character must have had some form of mental illness from one scene to the next she was someone different. Jason Sudeikis I just don't think he is funny, he is pretty much one character in all his films, a womanizing no hoper, the way he treats his ""family"" is ridiculous. (Yes I'm well aware they aren't exactly a family but these strangers and the way they behave with one other is ludicrous). It seems the writers (Bob Fisher) and directors (Rawson Marshall Thurber who also directed Dodgeball) idea of funny is to be as rude and crass as possible whilst at the same time insult as many viewers as possible by being sexist, racist, homophobic and belittling. I hated this movie, I didn't laugh at its stupidity the only time I actually laughed was at the end during the credits for one moment where the cast gave a nice little surprise to Jennifer Aniston. I just don't know what else to say here. What I do know though is there are a lot of people out there who still find this kind of comedy amusing, I guess its some kind of escapism or perhaps there is more to it. I'm not sure. The feedback I received when I said I had watched this film was very 50/50 some loved it whilst others loathed. I guess if you want the rude, crude, loose women, gay d#ck sucking, ear poking, weed baby, cartoon villains type of film you will love this.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Funny and Entertaining for what it is,"This certainly is cheesy and nonsensical but there really are some genuine laugh out loud moments. Some concepts they took too far (the idiot RV/DEA couple) and that really hurt the overall tone of the film. Still, you can tell that a lot of the funny lines were adlibbed based off the rather funny blooper reel they ran before the credits. Everyone was cast perfectly and you leave the cinema smiling just as you should for a goofy summer comedy. Some stuff was crass and over-the-top and I think that's why critics are all over the place with this one.Plus, Jennifer Aniston is as hot as ever and what about the young man actor that got to kiss the three TALENTED actresses in this film.

A Wildly Entertaining Comedy Heist,"We're the Millers is a raunchy, laugh-out-loud road trip comedy that combines outrageous humor with a surprising dose of heart. Directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber, the movie stars Jason Sudeikis, Jennifer Aniston, Emma Roberts, and Will Poulter as a mismatched group of strangers posing as a fake family to smuggle a massive load of marijuana across the Mexican border.The film's success lies in its over-the-top premise and the hilarious chemistry among its cast. Sudeikis shines as David, a small-time drug dealer forced into the scheme, while Aniston surprises as the street-smart stripper Rose, bringing sass and comedic timing to the mix. Emma Roberts and Will Poulter round out the ""family"" as the rebellious runaway Casey and the socially awkward Kenny, delivering standout moments that steal the show-especially Poulter's infamous ""No Ragrets"" tattoo gag and spider bite scene.The comedy is unapologetically crude, with plenty of moments that push the envelope. Yet, the script balances its raunchiness with genuinely funny situational humor and unexpected emotional beats. The ""family"" dynamics, while exaggerated for laughs, develop into a surprisingly heartwarming bond that gives the movie a relatable core.That said, the plot is predictable, and the humor won't land for everyone, particularly those sensitive to the film's edgier jokes. Still, for fans of comedies like Superbad or Horrible Bosses, We're the Millers offers an outrageous ride filled with laughs, ridiculous situations, and memorable one-liners.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Enjoyable but Shallow.,"We're The Millers is the latest R Rated flick telling the story of David Clark, a low level drug dealer who is assigned by his boss to move 'some' marijuana from Mexico to the US. He assembles The Millers, a family of sort which includes his neighbours, a Stripper, a runaway teenage girl and an 18 year old virgin. Under this pretense they hope to transport the marijuana in an RV and the movie is about the perils they face on their way. Basically its one of those roadtrip movies where the 'friends' are replaced by a 'fake family'.Directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber of the Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story fame, We're The Millers sets out the promise of being uproariously hilarious. The previews were good and it did seem like a run-of-the-mill comedy flick. And it deliver, the first half of the movie was indeed hilarious but halfway through it began stuttering both in pace and comedy. Post the second act, the scenes with another RV family felt like it went on forever. Had it been trimmed down a bit the movie would have been a much better watch.I never felt Jason Sudekis was a main-lead-material. Well, he tries hard here to convince me but even that fell flat. Maybe its coz the fact that this guy is boning Olivia Wilde that envies me (kidding obviously). The only movies I've seen Emma Roberts in a female-lead role were It's Kind of a Funny Story and 4.3.2.1. and she doesn't have a lot to do here as one of the Millers but she doesn't disappoint either. Will Poulter, despite his odd looks was surprisingly entertaining as well. Jennifer Aniston does steal all the limelight though, her striptease obviously being one of the (and most likely the only) USPs here. And it does bring a smile to my face that, strip or not, she's still got the same charm from F.R.I.E.N.D.SReferences to The Simpsons, The Dark Knight Rises were thrown in for cheap laughs. At times jokes felt bland and boring but that doesn't make the movie thoughthere are indeed scenes that tickle your funny bone. We're The Millers does not have over the top humor, neither does it have that much R rated jokes to make you feel like its Hangover all over again but for what its worth its okay for a lazy weekend watch. Ooh and wait till the end credits coz there is sweet sweet scene in the bloopers reel.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Wow...Surprisingly great,"I have to say that I agree with every other reviewer on this film. I really went into this movie thinking that it was going to be another dumb comedy. One of those stupid comedies with stupid one liners and ridiculous antics. I expected to hate it, but boy was I wrong. Normally I can't stand movies like this, but this movie was surprisingly amazing. Jennifer Aniston has definitely redeemed herself in my eyes, and Jason Sudeikis was a breath of fresh air. I had no idea who Jason Sudeikis was coming into this show. I don't watch SNL ever because, as far as I'm concerned, it hasn't been funny since the original cast of Belushi, Radner, Aykroyd, and Curtin. This guy was amazing and witty, and lead this entire movie to victory. You can just tell by watching him, that Jason Sudeikis is not only a great actor, but brilliant in real life. I am watching this movie again for a second time and felt compelled to write a review. I'm not going to go into any specifics because I don't want to give away any spoilers, but I urge you to watch this movie....especially if you (like me) go into it with very low hopes.

I don't even know where to start with the list of bad: foul language galore, which these days some directors I guess think will make their movies better and use it a lot, stupid dialog that will not inspire you but make you cringe, the characters are the scum of society which again these days directors seem to prefer to normal people and dedicate tons of movies to, stupid plot.

"We're The Miller is one of those comedies that has a few laugh out loud moments, but it isn't something we've haven't seen before","We're The Millers is about a pot dealer, played by Jason Sudeikis, who gets robbed of his drugs and money and his way of paying his drug lord back is by going to Mexico to smuggle some drugs for him in exchange for some cash. The Pot dealer decides the best way to get through and back through the boarder is to create a family and to go on a family vacation in a RV, because apparently, you don't get checked at the boarder when you're with your family right? Well, that's what the Millers believe ! And in movie world, that's exactly how it will happen. His family includes of a stripper, a gutter punk and his neighbour and some bonding and relationships ensue. Things go wrong with the smuggling and some bad guys come after them. They need to get the drugs to the drug king on time so they can get their money or else, they don't get anything at all.Looking beyond the stupid story, We're The Millers was surprisingly funny at parts. Jason Sudeikis is very funny and I'm looking forward to see him in more comedies. However, the film had a lot of vulgar humour and cheap laughs. Whatever happened to making good jokes and not resulting to penis and sex jokes?The humour was very low brow, but some of the jokes were funny. It just gets to the point where you get sick of the penis and sex jokes. We've seen it all before, even if it's done in different ways. In the film, a boy gets bitten in the penis by a spider. The boy pulls down his pants and you see his swollen testicle. If this scene wasn't added, I think I would have enjoyed it more. It wasn't necessary. It just seemed like a cheap laugh that I wasn't buying. People have their different tastes in comedy, and while I'm quite open to anything, it got to the point where I just didn't think it was funny anymore. The film had some funny lines, don't get me wrong, it just gets a little over done and makes you want the movie to end.I was surprised by Will Poulter. He played the nerdy type kid well and actually had most of the laughs. I've never heard of him before this, but I'm hoping I see him in more down the road. Emma Roberts was kind of a miscast for me. She didn't seem to play the punk type very well. I always see her as cute and innocent. Maybe I was just caught by surprised with how ""not innocent"" her character was. Jennifer Aniston was basically playing the role she always plays. Only difference is, she was a stripper. She was great in Horrible Bosses. That role was a change from the same role we've seen her play since Friends.Would I recommend We're The Millers? Well, if you like vulgar humour, then yes. We're The Miller is one of those comedies that has a few laugh out loud moments, but it isn't something we've haven't seen before. It's one of those movies that shouldn't be taken serious because there's nothing serious about it. Just your hard R movie with an unbelievable story. Sometimes, those movies are great, and while We're The Millers was alright, it was too vulgarity.Grade: C+Please be sure to check out my movie reviews and entertainment posts on www.themovieboy77.com",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Starts off hilariously, but then kind of fades","A disappointment. It's not that I went into it thinking it was going to be great or anything. I was only hoping for a decent comedy with a few laughs. It's that it starts off so great but then kind of fades into nothingness over the course of its runtime. Jason Sudeikis plays a pot dealer who, after losing his stash to muggers, is forced to travel to Mexico by his employer (Ed Helms) to pick up ""a smidge"" of marijuana for him. Stymied by the task, Sudeikis eventually comes up with a plan: recruit three misfits he knows to pretend to be his vacationing family, in the hopes that the border patrol will overlook it. There's his nerdy next door neighbor (Will Poulter, who several years ago starred in the excellent film Son of Rambow), a runaway teen girl (Emma Roberts) and a stripper (Jennifer Aniston). The four misfits bond and become more and more family-like. Problem is, all the best jokes occur in the first half hour. It really runs out of steam. After escaping Mexico, the Millers accidentally pair up with a DEA agent (Nick Offerman) and his family (Kathryn Hahn plays his wife). I love Offerman and Hahn, but the film never knows what to do with them (Offerman does get a couple of awesome moments). The film also never really knows what to do with Aniston or Roberts (there's a decent subplot near the end where Roberts falls for a carny and her ""parents"" try to stop her). Sudeikis starts off really well, but as the film runs out of steam he seems to be working overtime to get it back on track. Helms is probably the most consistent of the actors. He's great in all his scenes. This film isn't too bad a way to waste time, but I wish it were better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

WAY under rated movie,"Not gonna lie - came to watch this after watching the wonderful, amazing Ted Lasso series (at this point, 10 episodes into Season 2).First want to point out - I watched the extended version, which almost always makes a movie better (as the director can squeeze more shots).

I'm not saying this is on par with ""Something about Mary"" which has a laugh every 15 seconds or something. But, it does hit a lot of great notes, and the characters are fun enough to watch, that you can forget life for a bit.And, if you get another shot at watching Nick Offerman, you take it, right?

Don't try this as a family activity,"'We're the Millers' follows a drug dealer, a stripper, a runaway and a geek, who come together pretending to be a traditional, all American suburban family to smuggle a whole heap of drugs from Mexico into the US. Fortunately for us, Jennifer Aniston plays a stripper. With all the actors playing surprisingly likable characters, who's opposing chemistry works impeccably when put together. I usually find that most of the time, films that parade around claiming to be comedies, usually with one famous face to show, are often just not funny. But 'We're The Millers' was actually a good comedy; probably not in a witty sophisticated way, but it made me laugh. This film also has its emotions, in their own little unconventional ways, considering the leads were not exactly your average person. The film moves along at a pretty good pace but I must admit that it started to run a tad bit too long. Still, there are enough laugh here to make the film worth watching and the four leads are so good together I doubt many would complain if a sequel was to follow. National Lampoon's Drug Mule Vacation could be an alternative title as it has the vacation vibe. British actor Poulter is the revelation who takes this film by the scruff of the neck and it is funny enough to make you laugh along the way. An inane little time-killer with enough low laughs to placate undemanding audiences, this Warner Bros.

One of the funniest (not best) comedies of the recent years,"""We're The Millers"" is a 2013 comedy directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber starring Jason Sudeikis and Jennifer Aniston. I don't know about you, but I'm someone who watches movies according to the weather outside. I really can't explain that phenomenon, but the weather condition is always a main influence of my movie of choice. It's just that some films just feel way much better when the temperature in reality fits. If it's cold as hell outside and snow is everywhere there's an almost one hundred percent chance I'll be watching ""The Shining"", the other way around, when the sun is mercilessly melting the world to the ground you'll be finding me watching ""Predator"" and sweating with the characters. What I'm trying to say, this watch was inspired by the awesome weather and my tendency to revisit one of the hottest films of when I was in eighth grade. Funnily, we even watched this film in class once and back then I of course loved it. Honestly, the film doesn't fail to entertain me even as of today. Given the fact that it was made by the director of ""Dodgeball"", one of my favourite comedies growing up, it was probably was the reason it appeals so much to me. But not solely this. The film basically lives from it's sarcastic humour any the absolutely genuine chemistry of the protagonist faux family. Not only is Aniston showing how undeniably hot she is, also her Rachel-Green-with-more-cuss-words kind of acting is also a key factor this film works out so well. But Sudeikis is also delivering decently, Roberts is convincing and Poulter is awkwardly loveable as hell. I definitely cannot deny that I liked the characters immediately and really rooted for them all the time. Well, while the characters are undoubtedly entertaining it's undeniable that the story itself is absolutely generic. Enjoyable but yet absolutely generic. Drug dealer gone smuggler creates a fake family and tries to bring drugs from México to the USA. Most of it happens in the very beginning and then carries itself from trailer park to trailer park. It definitely isn't much, but fun to watch nevertheless. Most of the jokes work though and as already said, the general crude and at times even dark humour was absolutely fine with me, even when there were even a few scenes that created an uncomfortable sort of awkward tension. The idea with the weed baby? Argh. The other family talking about everything no-one wants to know about? I know that it's supposed to ridicule this concept, but it was more cringe worthy than actual hilarious. But that didn't stop me from having a good time. I loved how the characters developed and began to have actual feelings for each other and it was nothing short of heartwarming to see them having a happy end. All in all, this film is definitely not a comedic masterpiece, but it's a decent watch with absolutely loveable characters, enough naughty jokes and hilarious lines and definitely a pleasure to watch. The best thing is that this road trip makes me feel good. It's just a mindless fun to shut your brain off to. Nothing else did I expect to get from it. Oh, and I'm not gonna deny that I was sorta jealous of Poulter that he got to make out with both his female costars. But that's another story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

The film was nominated for several awards. A sequel is rumored to be in the works. This is your average comedy with some cheap gags. It's a little Smokey and the Bandit meets Vacation.

The Vidiot Reviews,"We're the MillersThe best thing about smuggling drugs in a Winnebago is you can poop out the condom-encased kilos onboard.Mind you, the motor home mules in this comedy don't have anything up their butts.Losing his stash helping his neighbour Kenny (Will Poulter) rescue teen-runaway Casey (Emma Roberts) from thugs, dealer David (Jason Sudeikis) must answer to his boss (Ed Helms).To absolve the debt, David commissions an RV, enlists Kenny, Casey and his stripper neighbour Rose (Jennifer Aniston), and heads to Mexico to pick-up an order of marijuana as the Miller family.However, they take the wrong shipment, and end up running from a kingpin (Tomer Sisley).While the crass story is unfocused, the titillating interplay between the Millers, and those they encounter, can be simultaneously deft and dumb.Incidentally, when you send your child to their room aboard an RV, you send them to the fold-out sleeper-bench in the kitchenette.Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Good Fun - First Laugh Out Loud Movie For a Long Long Time,"I watched this film with little expectations - based on Jennifer's poor track record after Friends. However although she was one of the main characters she was ably supported by an excellent cast.It was not pretentious - this was not a comedy with a hidden moral message - they were first time drug smugglers- whose only redeeming qualities were they were hopeless cases in their normal lives. You knew that they were good inside and that they would bond.However the comedy - some adult- was laugh out loud - with the normal misunderstandings that create a comic situation - but unlike other movies the situations were not overly extended beyond the initial surprise factor - i.e. the tent scheme - this was funny but was kept short. Other films would try and make more out of this type of situation joke and in doing so ruin it and make it totally unbelievable. Yes the premise for the film was unlikely but once you get over that everything else was not such a big jump.I would recommend highly - but I suppose I approached this film without hearing the hype so had low expectations - which I have now ruined for you as you will now - if you listen to me - have high expectations.

Not funny,Not funny at all. The language was so over the top and the double entendre's were not natural. I felt embarrassed for Jennifer Aniston and the script she had to follow. What ever happened to Movies like 'Tootsie' and 'What about Bob.' Movies with great acting and a great comedic script; scripts with not all the filth and language. Today's scripts are so riddled with bad language you can't even watch them with your children. With people like Seth Rogen pumping out scripts that are just filthy and not clever is what Hollywood has become. I'm not saying some language can be used but every other sentence just isn't funny to me. It takes no acting skills to mutter filthy language scripts.

Miller's Crossing,"Blackmailed into smuggling drugs across the Mexican border, a small-time drug dealer lures three social misfits to pose as his family to avoid suspicion in this energetic comedy starring Jason Sudeikis, Jennifer Aniston, Emma Roberts and Will Poulter. The zest of the film lies with the principal cast, all of whom are in top form. The film particularly comes alive as the foursome jump back and forth between assuming family stereotype roles from overprotective parent, to concerned sister to confused son and so on. There are also several great moments as they keep running into a vacationing police officer and his wife, who turn out to be less conservative than they first appear, while the likes of Luis Guzmán and Ed Helms have great cameo roles. As a comedy, the film is nevertheless uneven with several gags that are telegraphed way too far in advance (walking in on the kissing; the spider bite) and the antagonists are a bit too comical to be fearsome, but when the film does work, it shines. There is a hilarious line regarding a local Apple Store and some great running gags. Fans of Jennifer Aniston will probably take interest in her striptease scene, though the best gag with her happens during the closing credits. Flawed as it may be, 'We're the Millers' is certainly an amusing look at four lonely individuals who, quite by chance, form a really good surrogate family.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Coming from the director of Dodgeball, Jason Sudekis plays a career drug dealer who loses his stash & cash putting him in thrall to his boss, Ed Helms. Helms' proposition is to pick up a load of drugs from across the border & bring it back to the States. Seeing the easiest way for this endeavor to succeed is for him to pose as a family man in a RV on vacation to tote his swag so he enlists a neighbor, a street kid & his stripper neighbor (Jennifer Aniston) to be his family & away the comic antics go. Better than I thought it would be, it was an easy view from start to finish. The charades scene is one for the books.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Hysterical,"I waited for this to rent. I'm 55 and supposedly ""grown up"". This is one funny movie! Since I retired, I do things the old fashioned way and went to a video store and rented this as nothing seemed to catch my interest. Good thing! This was hysterical! And to top it off, warm and touching at times. Jennifer is gorgeous, dances like a professional stripper and has the body for it- Man, does she. Then Jason. Wow, what a funny guy. I like him very much in most of his latest movies but, this one takes the cake. He starts out as a small time pot dealer and ends the journey a much more open and honest gentleman as opposed to the immature, selfish and drug-dealing ""kid"" he was. His ""daughter"" is a homeless, street wise, child of the 21st Century- free spirited, irresponsible, lonely, and angry. His ""Son"" is a nerdy, virginal kid with problems at home- the same apartment complex Jason's character lives in. Jason's character gets ripped off by thugs and he now owes his supplier. His only option is to go to Mexico and along with his new ""family""- they set out on a funny and dangerous mission- to smuggle ""enough Marijuana to kill Willie Nelson"". A little profanity, a little sexual stimulation by Jenn's dancing, and few other ""adult situations"". Not for the whole family but, certainly for those with a funny bone and open-minded enough to see this without political argument- it's a movie after all. Rated R for language mostly and violence in the sense they had to shoot it out with drug dealers along the way. Great weekend movie, bad weather movie or just great for watching comedy without too much sex, violence, or ugliness.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Funny comedy undermined by studio formula,"We're the Millers delivers some great laughs and lots of promise before it descends into lame cliché that robs it of potentially classic comedy status. With an interesting, edgy premise – neighbourhood drug dealer forced to smuggle weed from Mexico hires a fake family to get it across the border – the movie consistently delivers laughs-out-loud as this band of foul-mouthed social malcontents somehow clicks and makes it happen. The first half is totally engaging, except perhaps for an implausible Ed Helms as the affable drug baron, while the pace and laughs allow you to overlook a few minor plot flaws, which unfortunately snowball in the schmaltzy second half.This a Hollywood movie, so you can't really expect the cynical take on the American family to continue, but the switch from satire to sentiment left me wondering if the script was butchered by studio bean counters, or was it always lame? The movie becomes part cliché RV comedy when they meet up with another family on wheels, part teen love story, part drug thug chase movie, and ultimately a full-on family-values feel-good fest that becomes nauseatingly obvious. While the cast is great and keeps up the laughs, the plot becomes a formulaic insult to the intelligence.Without giving anything away, I just want to know why does Hollywood feel it has to embrace the truly pukeful heart-on-the-sleeve speech finale? Do all Americans at some stage in their lives find themselves upon the podium, or staring down the barrel of a gun, and deliver lump-in-the-throat speeches that make you want to cheer for America or the human race? And do they get away with it without being heckled, laughed off stage, or shot? Go see this movie for the laughs, but it could have been so much better under the guiding hand of bolder indi producers.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Fun Comedy -- Hard R,"Entertaining comedy. Builds well and I liked the ending. Jason S. Seems to be doing an 80s Bill Murray type of thing, and it stands out from the post-irony stuff that seems to be the norm. Anniston is miscast, but there were lots of great cameos and smaller roles. Ed Helms with his orca was a highlight, and Scotty P was memorable--his outtakes had me wanting more. I'm glad there are still some R-rated comedies being made that are making money, because a lot of the PG ones feel too restrained. I think after this movie and Wedding Crashers, we can consider any Fisher and Faber projects something to look forward too. Here's hoping for more.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Better than expected,"We're the Millers was a surprisingly fun and funny movie. Small time pot dealer played by Jason Sudeikis is robbed of the money he owes to his supplier, so to pay off the debt, the goofy and eccentric supplier sends him on a big time smuggling deal into Mexico. As cover, Sudeikis convinces stripper/neighbor Rose (Jennifer Aniston) to pose as his wife, runaway Casey (Emma Roberts) as their daughter, and young neighbor Kenny (Will Poulter) as their son-- and together they become the uber-American family, the Millers. Naturally, the situations and people they run into going and returning ensure nothing goes according to plan. There were lots of chuckle-out-loud moments (not so many full blown belly laughs), and it moved along at a pretty fast clip. The performances were all outstanding, especially Sudeikis. Loved watching him! Parents: some sexually suggestive scenes won't be appropriate for kids, or you'll have some 'splainin to do. All in all, a real fun film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Very funny.,"WE'RE THE MILLERSAnother Jennifer Aniston comedy... Does anyone think she will try a serious role? I think she would be quite good at it... and no... Leprechaun does not count. haha.We're the millers is a comedy about a drug dealer who is forced into picking up a lot of drugs and smuggling it into America from Mexico. He thinks he will never gets away with it on his own so decides to get himself a fake family and pretend they are on vacation. He hires the dopey boy that lives in his apartment, a runaway girl that hangs out outside his place and his stripper neighbour that hates him. All goes well until they get some serious drug lord after them for stealing their stash.I liked it a lot actually... it was so much better than I thought it was going to be. But that was mostly because of the acting. The actors had some great lines and they had the timing down perfectly. The comedy was very funny and it was not a romantic comedy, so the romance was little which made the film better anyway.The movie stars Jennifer Aniston, Jason Sudeikis, Emma Roberts & Will Poulter. Everyone in this film had great lines and were good, funny characters. I am not sure they should have got Jennifer to play a stripper though. Yes she has a good body and she pulled it off well, but I still think she was a little too old to play a stripper. But then if they got someone younger, it would not have been as convincing for her to be the kids mother. It is a tricky part to cast. But she did a good job anyway. The funniest character though was Kenny, played by Will Poulter. Will has such a funny expression and has a great way of acting a bit dim. He was by far the funniest character and the film would not have been anywhere near as good if he was not cast in it. It is hard to believe he was the kid in Son of Rambow. I didn't even recognise him.The story was good, the comedy was good and the acting was good. If there was anything bad to say about it, I would say it is just another typical comedy. There were some very cheesy moments, and there was a bit of romance near the end... but that is to be expected these days in most comedies. It is not the best comedy I have ever seen, but it is still very entertaining and worth watching.I will give this film 7 out of 10.""This is not a smidge of pot!

Certain Extent Comedy,"We're The Millers blends forms of comedy into one, as the film works for several reasons. Although predictable, it is entertaining, and some of the comedic jokes do work well. The chemistry is there as we see the cast come together as one family towards the end. What works in the movie is its offensive and raunchy comedy, a type of comedy that most often just goes horribly wrong. The entire cast is simply fantastic at making the gross out stuff work and even better at delivering the site gags. Sudeikis is obviously the core of the group, but it's Poulter who steals the show as the half-witted fake son with a heart of gold. Anniston and Roberts are both fine on screen. Anniston as well plays her part convincingly to some extent.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
There's Something About The Millers. ♦ 66%,"I laughed numerous times and trust me, they were at the intended humor and by the look of it, the writers have worked hard on those parts.

What looks like a story generated at that water-machine chat turns out to fill in your calm afternoon with laughs & gross-out fun.

Jennifer Aniston, my my, isn't she hot? The other two do their parts well, too.

"Eustace, Is That You? What Happened in Narnia?","I must say, it's a hilarious film despite those backlash from the critics. This is again like I said in my 'This is The End' review, is the film that you could watch twice or maybe more and you could still be entertained.Aniston, like in every comedy film she's in, her performances are all the same. Despite that, she always deliver a good one, she makes her works look so easy, like without even trying. I'd like to see her step out of her comfort zone and do some dramatic role, we all want to see her standing at the Oscars stage and give us the Best Actress speech.Poulter, Eustace is that you? It's great to see an actor 'grow' in this industry, and more of that, he's an international star now. There's a little bit cringe moment of him in this film but hey that's normal for every actor, I believe.The cast's performance is very decent. It took 4 people to get the script done, and still it didn't create a 'perfect' film. It's safe to say, comedy films don't get enough credit and It's rare for them to be noticed at awards season.

"We're the Millers is an entertaining but uneven crime comedy, the acting and character interactions are great","A veteran pot dealer creates a fake family as part of his plan to move a huge shipment of weed into the U. S. from Mexico.The premise of We're the Millers is actually quite original, mostly because of the writing and the actors chosen to play the characters. Jason Sudeikis, Jennifer Aniston, Emma Roberts and Will Poulter portray the Millers and they all do a terrific job with both comedic timing and acting. Nick Offerman, Kathryn Hahn, Molly Quinn and Ed Helms is in the supporting cast. Rawson M. Thurber directed the film and he did a good job with creating a crime comedy, but I think the film would have been better in the hands of a different director. But whilst the story is good, I found the screenplay to be average, some lines of dialogue were stupid and just not as funny, luckily enough the actors' execution saved most of the bad dialogue. It's very uneven. But jokes like the weed baby make for some truly hilarious moments. But the screenwriters didn't really have realism in mind whilst writing the script, but was it needed? It all depends on what kind of movie you expected it to be, I didn't expect it to be this uneven going from ridiculous to serious. But I've to admit I liked the characters and their interactions together, the writers and director nailed the drama aspect of the movie. Again, I have to praise Jason Sudeikis, Jennifer Aniston, Emma Roberts and Will Poulter for their work in this film. Truly brilliant for a comedy film. I wish the sequel gets made as it has potential, with all the character development in this film, they could go in so many directions with a sequel.Overall, We're the Millers is a good crime comedy, but it's the character interactions that make the movie good and even quite great at times. It's well thought but uneven at times, but an entertaining film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Enjoyable, but nothing special","In a year in which most comedies have been rather lackluster, We're The Millers is above the previously mentioned, but still not as good as it could've been.What makes the film work is the chemistry between the cast. Jason Sudeikis is great as always and gets the best material to work with her. Jennifer Aniston and the actors playing the kids do a good job as well. They all helped carry this movie and are the most enjoyable thing about it. Ed Helms also has a supporting role in which he is fantastic! The film has a great setup and the first 30 minutes are really funny. However, once the films kicks into gear and the characters hit the road, it somewhat falls apart a bit. The main problem with the film is that the script is weak and doesn't deliver as many laughs as it should. That's not to say all of the jokes fall flat, but I found myself chuckling a lot more than actually laughing. They could've really done something fun with this concept, but instead it ends up feeling like a generic road trip movie with an uneven mix of raunchy R-rated and weak sitcom level humor. A good majority of the funniest parts of the film were already spoiled in the red band trailer which also didn't help.Don't get me wrong this is not a terrible film, but you'd expect something with a bit more effort put into it considering the people involved. It has plenty of decently funny moments and the cast does an excellent job. But, the script is very weak and it never takes full advantage of it's concept. It's still better than some other recent comedies such as The Hangover: Part III and Grown Ups 2, but it's still rather disappointing and a bit dull.Worth a rental.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
An adventure comedy with some good dialogue that delivers on the giggles,"Funny for me is not really a matter of opinion. I think that if something is funny then it's universal. That's why comedies do so well in the mainstream. Laughing is some of the best medicine that a doctor can't prescribe. And I think my comedy IQ is decent enough that I can laugh at just about anything. I know that may sound egotistical but I love a good comedy. Especially for me a good R-rated comedy. We're The Millers trailers made it look a bit stupid at first glance. It was a low concept premise that had to deliver on the performances and the writing.The story goes as follows, in trying to do the right thing a drug dealer (Jason Sudeikis) gets robbed and owes his boss (Ed Helms) money and drugs. In order to pay him back he has to go to Mexico to pick up a shipment. He gets this crazy idea to pose as a family with two people that live in his building, a stripper (Jennifer Aniston) and a goofy kid (Will Poulter). The one thing is that not everything is as it seems. Most of the main characters don't like each other which leads to some of the best lines in the film. They get into comedy hi-jinks, some action hi-jinks and meet a very ""open"" family led by Nick Offerman.As funny goes this film has some good moments. There are moments when I was laughing not stop and there are other jokes that fall short. Sudeikis does his shtick well and the guy has the comedy chops. I'm not a fan of Aniston but put her in an vulgar comedy and I'm there. She's found a nice home in this genre. Poulter is decent as the awkward ""son"" and he has one of the best moments in the movie. Emma Roberts plays the fourth in the group thankfully sticking to her angst teen act which fits well with the other cast members. Offerman is cool in a extended cameo. It's not much of a change from his cameo in 21 and 22 Jump Street.The script plot wise is a little hit or miss but the dialogue is great. I love the banter between the characters that at times holds nothing back. I know that most movies of this nature go for guy nudity plays as a joke, which it is here. But I was shocked to see the only nudity in this movie was male and it was full frontal. That's forward thinking. Way to go Sudeikis and the filmmakers for battling equal nudity in films. It's also a scene that had me dying. The film does runs a bit slow in the middle. The finale is a bit of a let down but brings everything full circle. I just thought the drama and ""family values"" were a bit heavy handed. I get that every character has to go through their evolution as humans but it could have been done less after school special.This is a decent addition to the new line of popular comedy. It seems like Sudeikis is a part of the new school comedy coming in. Add this film to The Hangover films and Horrible Bosses as that adventure vulgar comedy genre that seems to be slowly picking up steam. I giggled more than I laughed but when I laughed it was hard. Much funnier than I had initially thought, We're The Millers is nice for a Saturday when you just need something lightly dusted with laughs.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Hilarious, Fun, and Stupid","Robbie K is back with another movie review and boy what a fun movie it is. This time I share my thoughts on the latest comedy, We're The Millers, a movie that seems to have fans raving. With a cast of NBC veterans like Jennifer Aniston and Jason Sudeikis, the funny factor for this movie seems potentially high, well that and the ridiculous plot the trailer hints at. Yet many comedies prove to be rather stupid or so vulgar that they become garbage polluting the movie pool, yet still seem to be so popular. What's my verdict on this film? Find out below.In case you haven't seen the trailers, We're The Millers centers on dysfunctional family situations, which have been beaten to death in various media. Yet the creative minds behind this movie managed to salvage this overused concept and instead give it a modern twist to make it enjoyable for the masses, while at the same time crossing into uncomfortable territory for some. What is this twist? Essentially a ridiculous adventure of a drug dealer named David Clark (Sudeikis) being sent to Mexico to pick up an obscene amount of drugs for his supplier (Ed Helms). To achieve this rather risky operation, he decides to make a fake family consisting of a stripper (Anniston), an abandoned virgin (Will Poulter), and a runaway (Emma Roberts) to assist him crossing the border. Sounds hilarious doesn't it?Well in truth I indeed laughed my head off at this movie that had a bit of comedy for all to enjoy and relish in. While most comedies I prefer to watch are kiddier, involve bathroom humor, or clever uses of geekiness, We're the Millers somehow had me laughing at the more mature and drug centered themes. The sexual innuendos, awkward situations, and crossing into uncomfortable territory were gradually increased in intensity as the journey continued, instead of cranking the awkward level up to max at the very beginning. Perhaps what I liked even more was the fact that all these situations were cleverly integrated into the façade of the dysfunctional family, instead of just having idiotic characters mouth of and randomly spouting out disgusting and awkward phrases. Unlike many modern stoner/alcoholic comedies, this movie also broadens its humor to not just focus on sex and masturbation, but again cross into uncomfortable subjects without turning into an R rated light porno. Was I the only one who enjoyed this? Not even close, the entire audience laughed the night away at the constant insults, references, and reactions of the faux family and their surrounding cast. Of course what also helps bring laughs is the stupidity of just about every cast member on set that allows the insanity to occur. I'll admit many of these things are jabs to humanity and the government, but it's still fun and one hast to let go of how ridiculous the concept is. Those who can't, well take a break and look for another movie, as well as those who hate sexual and drug based comedy.Of course no good comedy can be done without a good dialog and acting. We're the Millers definitely isn't the best when it comes to these things, but it's certainly built for the fun adventure to be had. Sudeikis for once isn't a complete pervert or idiot as I've found him to play in previous roles, and somehow curses his way past my low tolerance level to be funny, yet sometimes annoying. I guess it's the time limit David has keeping him grounded, as well as the predictable ""story"" forcing him to be a little more balanced and less stupid. Roberts is enjoyable as well, not only very beautiful, but brings some edge to her insults that remind me of my roommate's quips. Yet for me, it has to be Poulter and Aniston who got me to laugh the hardest. Poulter's character Kenny is like a white Urkel, geeky, innocent, and big hearted, whose qualities counter the selfishness of the other three. While some will find this annoying, this good Samaritan attitude keeps the comedy balanced and adapting as Kenny's experiences, and in some cases inexperience, leads to the family having to shove their morals aside and do something funny to save the day. Kenny also has a few embarrassing moments that will speak to geeks and 90's pop junkies to have tears rolling down their eyes. Aniston is just as good as she always does, using her beauty and talents to create a believable, and often-lovable character. The actress uses her body, words, and reactions to drive every scene, often stealing the show and causing the most laughs for me. Her ability to use sarcasm is fantastic; the way she slings her curses sparingly and well timed to get the most laughs and not be annoying. The awkward moments I have mentioned often involve her in some way, and her character (Rose) does a great job adapting to the situation, while still requiring assistance to help her out. Of course alone these characters are good, but together they really shine, and when combined with the extras, makes for a fun, albeit crude adventure. As for the cursing, well this summer must have helped me develop a tolerance, but We're the Millers dialog is full of many F bombs and other words I try not to say, though the dialog is not solely the foul mouthed slang.While definitely not a masterpiece in terms of story, character development, or really fantastic editing, We're the Millers is very fun and enjoyable. Many will love the ridiculous adventure, the stupid laughs, and the cheap blows Hollywood has prepared for us. Go see it if you are looking for something fun, but avoid if you have lower tolerances for any of the things I've mentioned. My scores for this movie are:Comedy/Crime: 8.0 Movie Overall: 6.0",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Puff the magic dragon,"We're The Miller's is a lightheaded comedy and the ultimate pot head's dream assignment. To bring in a pinch of grade A maryjane from Mexico. Seems like an easy assignment and David Clark (Jason Sudeikis) decides to come over with the cover of a family vacation. Nothing is hotter than Jennifer Anniston (Rose O'Reilly) as the dotting wife and the two happy along kids. This movie is basic story line with a few mixed in twist in turns. If you want to take the ultimate road trip, then check out this flick. There are some funny lines and the adventure is crazy. Jennifer Anniston still has her sexy flair as she goes from stripper to housewife. A silly movie that has few giggles along the way.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Dig at disabled people unwarranted!,I watched this movie today and as a woman who is married to a man with no arms and therefore has 2 hooks for hands I am horrified that you would make a dig at people like him in the movie. Why even talk about a man with hooks for hands entering a strip club? So what if they do? The comment had nothing at all to do with the movie so why have it in the movie? It wasn't even funny! That scene should be removed!I nearly walked out of the movie but didn't. Wish now that I had. The rest of the movie was poor very adult jokes and although at times I laughed it was predictable and a waste of my time.I think an apology re the disabled dig should be issued.,3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The Millers Family Road Trip,"This was never a great movie but I remember liking it a lot more than I did this time around.

Fun but ....,"We're the millers a comedy criminal movie about umm I don't want to burn . I will get into my review about the movie directly .So first of all it's really good comedy criminal action movie . And the best thing is the way the guy who acted the character David it was so fun and amazing he was the best . Also about the cast it was amazing and evryone was great . The plot was good and fun like you don't feel the time when you watch it .But the worst thing that I didn't like that it's not a family movie . I hoped it would be a family movie so it would be more fun because it's about a family and how they are in actual and other stuffs but it was so bad because it wasn't at all a family movie and I really really wished hardly that it's a family movie and I was so shocked . There were so many over 18 scenes and things and scenarios in the movies so that made the movie a little wierd and weakTo sum up , I rate this movie 7 out 10 and I advice you to watch if you were bored otherwise I don't .",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Run of The Mill(ers) Comedy,"We're The Millers is a typical summer comedy. The first half starts out poorly paced, gives little time to establish anything but roughly sketched out characters, and its crude, stereotypical jokes simply fail (and not just because they're crude but because the acting and direction is hurried and poorly conceived). The actors simply seem to be going through a routine. At this point it seemed to be a good idea for a movie gone typically awry. Once the Fitzgerald family enters the movie though, things begin to pick up and there are some genuinely funny (albeit mostly predictable) moments. Overall, the film is decent enough to pass some time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Dumb idea bringing the fun.,"It's all about smuggling the drug across the border, and the plan comes with an idea of putting a fake family together to get the task done. That's where the fun starts.

"A virgin, stripper, drug dealer, and runaway all go on a marijuana smuggling ""family"" vacation.","Where to start? This movie is hilarious. It was made to be a comedy and that's exactly what it is. Ed Helms is the drug lord and he just ads that special something. Their is a virgin, a stripper, a runaway, and a drug dealer but somehow the film makes us care about them. Nick Offerman - ""Ron Swanson"" from the show ""Parks and Rec"" is in it and he is awesome. That guy needs to be in more projects. Anyways, this movie is one of those that you can watch over and over and still enjoy it.Dislikes: Emma Roberts character - Casey, is boring. She doesn't find her character in this film, sorry. All the other characters learn something. They evolve. I just don't see that with her. I don't think it is her acting because I usually like her a lot.

Better than it's poster & trailer,"Jason Sudeikis is David Clark, a veteran pot dealer who is forced to drive to Mexico and pick up a load of marijuana for his supplier. In order to get past boarder patrol with ease, David gets a stripper named Rose, played by Jennifer Aniston, a runaway girl, played by Emma Roberts, and the neighbor kid, Kenny, played by Will Poulter, to pose as his family.Jason Sudeikis proves he has what it takes to be a leading man. Emma Roberts does well with the little she's given. In Horrible Bosses, Jennifer Aniston proved to be able to play dirty and get laughs but here she doesn't seem to be taking her role very seriously. However her role is so horribly written, the blame is on the writers, who seem to have never met real-life broke and desperate strippers before. And really, who hasn't? It's Nick Offerman and Will Poulter who save the film. Poulter with his performance and Offerman simply with his presence.Despite some horrible marketing choices for the film, We're The Millers actually delivers some good laughs as a raunchy adult comedy. The poster is hard to look at, the trailer seems to give the entire plot away and makes the film look predictable and unfunny. Yet the film seems to embrace it's stories stupidity by not taking itself too seriously and having as much fun as possible. The fun the cast is having comes through and makes it an enjoyable experience with some surprise laugh-out-loud moments.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The Millers,"We're The Millers is a rare and exceptional comedy movie. It's a modern day redefinition of what it means to be funny while still maintaining a good story line and a decent plot. The concept itself is so funny. A group of misfits who band together to pretend to be a family in order to smuggle back drugs to repay a debt. It's instantly funny without even trying and then it's met with great writing, funny moments throughout, and lovable characters with great actors. From start to finish you see the characters grow and develop while still maintaining being a true comedy movie. Totally recommend this movie to anyone.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Surprisingly enjoyable,"Saw it on HBO, not the type of movie I'd go to see. That said, despite expectations to the contrary, I rather enjoyed the movie. The fake family construct offered a lot of good comedic twists. Jason Sudeikis is already a comedic force to be reckoned with, and has the added plus of being a naturally endearing character, just like Anniston. Sudeikis is going to go beyond Adam Sandler, Steve Carrell, Seth Rogen. He's got leading man good looks and a brilliant comedic flair and a delivery like Vince Vaughn, Bradley Cooper, Ben Stiller, and Paul Rudd, and given the right material could go very far. And he will be able to crossover into dramatic roles as well. So even with some predictable plot turns the movie was still able to bring some originality without stretching credulity too far. I cringed at the spider scene, because it is SUCH a played out routine--I'm surprised they don't have a retirement home for Tarantulas. And the fake family dynamics was just smarmy enough to make it work and make it endearing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"What a funny, sweet movie - a must see!","I can't believe how good this was - I was not expecting it to be so funny. It was kind of a hybrid between Half-baked and Little Miss Sunshine, but not exactly - shared some of the same comedic elements. Entire cast was stellar and by the end of the movie you truly grow attached to them. I would like to see a sequel because I enjoyed these characters so much. There was never a dull moment in it, either - pace keeps flowing with one table-turning event after another. Starts off as a ""fake"" family, as the movie describes, but not only do we grow to care about the characters - they grow to care about each other.

We are drug smugglers,"National Lampoon's Drug Mule Vacation could be an alternative title as it has the vacation vibe.A small time, nice guy drug dealer (Jason Sudeikis) is forced to smuggle drugs by his boss and lookalike (Ed Helms).Sudeikis has the idea that posing as a happy family might not invite suspicion at the border crossing and persuades his neighbour who is a stripper (Jennifer Aniston.) A homeless teenager as his daughter and a nerdy boy (Will Poulter) to be his son and off they go in a RV.The film is sporadically funny thanks more to Poulter although there does not seem to be much road comedy.The plot comes to life after the drugs have been picked up with the predictable double cross. Then it becomes a chase film with the added bonding issues with the 'family'. After an abrasive start they seem to act like an actual family.Sudeikis does comedy with his sarcasm. His character is supposedly a rebel but just looks like a nerdy slacker who never became a bank manager and has no business living in a low rent, rough neighbourhood.Aniston does a few sexy scenes and there seems to be a budding romance between them.British actor Poulter is the revelation who takes this film by the scruff of the neck and it is funny enough to make you laugh along the way.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Could have been worse, but still not great","I was expecting to hate We're the Millers because it is a comedy that looked like it would just be chock full of lazy jokes about sex and drugs (my biggest struggle with modern comedy.) In many ways, it was exactly everything I expected. And yet there was a story at the core of this film that actually charmed me. It was kind of fun watching these misfits who have rejected a more mundane family life suddenly discovering that belonging to a family might not be so bad after all. There was some emotion in this story, and it won me over. I even laughed at some of the jokes despite the fact that they weren't the most creative or intelligent bits of comedy. I think the cast helped me tolerate this movie more than I would have with other actors. Jason Sudekis is quite good in the lead role, and you can actually buy his character arc. And the surprise hit of the film was WIll Poulter who provides a lot of the heart to the story, and proves he has great comedic timing.All that positive stuff being said, I have to clarify that I'm grading We're the Millers on a big curve. If it had looked like a movie I would enjoy from the trailers, then perhaps I would be less forgiving of the stupid garbage that is littered throughout it. There are two scenes in particular that I felt dragged on for way too long and lacked any decent jokes. They were constructed with the most juvenile humor imaginable and annoyed me rather than bringing a hearty laugh. The story is quite predictable, and I was a little annoyed by the clueless nature of the main character. It seems like he never catches on to the fact that he's being manipulated the entire time. While Jason Sudekis is playing a character that is a jerk and a loser, he never came across as an idiot. I could easily see why others would hate We're the Millers, and it's not a film I loved all that much. However, there's an underlying story that worked for me, to the point that I was genuinely excited to see how it would end.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

The only part I didn't like in the movie was the main villain. He was just too cliché which made him WAY too predictable. Other than that the movie is great. The ending was really great too.

Aniston gets 'em off.,"To pay off a debt, small-time pot dealer David Clark (Jason Sudeikis) agrees to smuggle a shipment of marijuana across the border from Mexico; in order to raise less suspicion, he assembles a fake family, comprising of stripper Rose (Jennifer Aniston) as his wife, neighbour Kenny (Will Poulter) as his nerdy son, and homeless waif Casey (Emma Roberts) as his daughter.Okay, I'll admit it like most male viewers (I suspect), my main reason for watching We're The Millers was to see Jennifer Aniston doing her well publicised striptease routine, but I actually found the film entertaining for several other reasons: while not all of the gags necessarily hit the mark, those that do are extremely funny and there are enough laughs throughout to make the trip with the 'Millers' worthwhile; the cast is extremely likable and work very well together; and although it's a tad cliché, there is a fuzzy, feel-good factor about the whole thing despite the film being about drug smugglers.Although it's unlikely to make anyone's All-Time Top Ten Comedies list, We're The Millers is an enjoyable enough time waster with the added bonus of Aniston in her undies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Not as good as I hoped.,"We're the Millers is unfortunately your typical modern comedy. The acting is good enough but the plot is predictable and the situational humor is drowned by the absurdity of the situations themselves, effectively losing the entire point of situational humor. Jason Sudeikis is typically really funny but he isn't given much to work with here. Jennifer Aniston looks amazing and Emma Roberts is about as pretty as they come but they don't push this movie over mediocre. Honestly, the only really entertaining thing about the film is the other family they run into. Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn are hilarious and own the screen when they're on. Again though, they don't have enough screen time to make the movie better than meh. The funniest scene in the entire film, in my opinion, actually takes place after the movie during the blooper reel. In it they replace the TLC song from the trailer with the theme song from Friends, catching Jennifer Aniston, aka Rachel, off guard. I got a good laugh out of that but when the best laughs come from the bloopers, there's clearly something missing in the movie. Overall, it's not a bad movie but it should've been much better. I have a feeling the only reason most people are giving it higher ratings is because of the stripper scenes.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

A Road Trip Full of Chaos,"We're the Millers doesn't try to reinvent comedy; it just wants to make you laugh with its shameless humor and absurd situations. The story is simple but effective: a small-time drug dealer comes up with a fake family to smuggle drugs across the border without getting caught. To pull it off, he teams up with a stripper, a clueless teenager, and a tough girl. As you can imagine, things quickly spiral out of control, turning the trip into a mess full of chaos and ridiculous situations. The movie follows the style of classic American raunchy comedies, with jokes that sometimes land and others that fall flat, but overall, it delivers a fun time.The cast is one of its biggest strengths. Jason Sudeikis nails the comedic timing with his sarcastic humor, while Jennifer Aniston brings charisma and fits well into her role. However, the real scene-stealer is Will Poulter, whose awkward and endearing teenage character delivers some of the funniest moments. Ed Helms also stands out, adding a touch of craziness to his villainous role.This isn't a refined comedy, and it doesn't try to be. We're the Millers goes for straightforward humor, with absurd moments that, while not always perfect, get the job done. The ending is predictable, and some scenes could have been tighter, but if you're looking for a lighthearted comedy without big ambitions, it's a solid choice for a good time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Great Eentertainment Value.... Light Comedy Movie,"We're the Millers was nowhere on my list till very recently when I came across this in one of the wishlists on IMDb. With an average rating of 7, I knew it could go either way - luckily it went the right way as the movie didn't disappoint at all.Story (8/10): The plot is about how a seasoned drug dealer, with the help of a completely made-up and a dysfunctional family, smuggles in a bountiful of weed into the US from Mexico. With a wife (stripper), son (weird ""inexperienced"" teenager) and a daughter (runaway teenager), he sets off on a journey where he'll not only need to escape from the police and the border control but also manage his completely out of sync ""family"" till he reaches back. While the story is interesting, it is the screenplay that elevates it with brilliant punches, one- liners, and hilarious sequences.Acting (8/10): This is the second Jason Sudeikis movie I've watched after Mother's Day, and he is one of the most natural actors I am seeing off late in Hollywood. Apart from him, Will Poulter shined with a more difficult role to play and he did it very well with his amazing expressions. Jennifer Anniston was great with brilliant chemistry with Jason Sudeikis (which is perhaps why they almost paired again in Mother's Day). Emma Roberts was great to watch in her role as a runaway, self-learned teenager who is probably the most outspoken of the four. The rest of the cast supported the movie well. However, it was largely a Sudeikis movie.Direction (9/10): Rawson impresses with the direction. Some of the sequences were very well conceptualized. He brought the best out of the cast and does a commendable job of creating a very light and hilarious movie.Overall (8/10): Overall, the movie has a great entertainment value and a definite watch in case you are in a mood a light comedy movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
They're the Millers,"The film is cool, I surprised my expectations. It's a good movie to watch, relax and laugh, but nothing fantastic either.Starting with the casting and acting, David Clark, in the role of Jason, made a strange performance, it is rather a good actor and did a good role in this movie, but him as a drug dealer/ drug smuggler not able to convince me, that teen hair early in the film and his acting ""rude"" really did not seem to me to combine (although I imagine that chooses for the role he was because he could easily pass for a ""straight-laced family man""). Jennifer Aniston had a normal performance, despite their interesting strip scene. Emma Roberts seems to act always the same, but in this film like this came together in his role, that riot girl with parents (which could be better spent). Will Poulter, playing Kenny, was what more surprised me, I believe he can get more at the scene of current cinema, has potential. Among others, Ed helms had a very bad acting, and the father Fitzgerald (Nick Offerman) very surprising, it was cool.The plot is cool and well done. But I still think some scenes a little too forced, like that of Pablo escape with the trailer or the meeting between Jason and Brad ; others were cool and could be better exploited. Overall it was cool, especially considering it is a comedy film that should not be taken too seriously.Overall, this is it, the film is cool and fun.

Better than I thought; a disturbing undertone,"The trailers looked good. Early buzz about the movie said it was disappointing. I relied on the buzz because I'm not a huge Sudeikis fan and Aniston has been hit and miss in her projects.The film had its funny moments and some colorful characters. The movie shows that the world of drug dealing and smuggling is a dangerous world, but then turned that into a long gag. Yeah, it's a comedy, but the attitude that Sudeikis displayed was that yeah, bad things are happening and some people were probably killed, but I'm a hip little dealer who is cooler than everyone else. That recurring attitude just added a little stink to what was an enjoyable movie. Aniston was okay, but the character was pretty cliché. Standouts were William Pouter(funny, funny), Matthew Willig as One-Eye, Emma Roberts, and Molly Quinn.

Very funny - everything works.,"Surprisingly this movie is extremely funny and gets funnier as it goes along. It's well written and original with a combination of funny situations and one liners. The characters are endearing. Unlike the comedies these days which rely on excessive crudeness, this one doesn't. Yet the jokes are current enough especially the Border jokes.The cast of the fake family smuggling drugs is terrific. Jennifer Aniston has cornered many of the best comedies of recent years and she deserves it. She still is very slim enough to pull off the stripper role tastefully. Jason Sudeikis is suited to his role as drug dealer - brings to mind an updated Chevy Chase in the National Lampoon movies. Emma Roberts is also well cast as the sulky runaway. Will Poulter as the 18 year old virgin has such a comically hilarious face. He has some of the funniest scenes. Supporting cast is good too.Really good comedies are few and far between maybe one or two a year - go see it in the cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

A Poor Effort,"This is one of those movies that tries really hard at being funny....but it's not. It is loaded with profanity that does not quiet role right with the actors and that is said in a way that is reminiscent of a second grader trying to boost their tough guy image with excessive swearing.The story line is very clichéd and weak. This is the sort of movie you only show your friends if you secretly hate them. Its the same old theme; a goof-ball owes a drug dealer money, he pays the dealer back buy moving drugs and runs into several unplanned obstacles, in the end the good guys win, goof-ball gets off debt free and falls in love with the beautiful side kick.Overall the unnecessary overuse of profanity and nude men dampen the movie when they are put in to try and add some humour.

Funny but not really good.,"Let's say you can buy into a nearly fifty year old Jennifer Aniston as a stripper.Maybe you can even buy a forty year old Jason Sudeikis as the hip drug dealer who dresses like a Dave Matthews fan.Then you can probably buy that when they pretend to be a family their kids are almost thirty.They go from ridiculous parodies of old people trying to be cool to actual old people with very old children.I guess that makes sense in some other dimension.While the premise and plot are very thin, there are some good jokes in here.There's a stripper with a tattoo over her box that says ""Boner Garage"".That's comedy gold.Ed Helms is hilarious as usual and Nick Offerman is very disappointing as usual.The worst thing about this movie is the very long and totally unnecessary campground scene.It has nothing to do with the story and turned a good 90 minute comedy into a two hour test of your movie watching ability.I guess what I'm trying to say is that this movie is very average.If you never see it you have two hours to watch something else.If you do see it, you probably won't be angry.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"Far better than expected, multiple giggling opportunities","I have been gradually starting to select movies for watching on the basis of directors and/or actors; therefore, I was long hesitant to see We're the Millers as respective names (director + 2 ""older"" stars) have not impressed me much. Luckily, the first 10 minutes or so already showed that I was wrong: the plot was well constructed and smooth, sex-related scenes were funny, not banal, characters were elaborated, acting was true to nature and distinct; above all, I was surprised to see Jennifer Aniston (as Sarah ""Rose"" O'Reilly) in a new and pleasant angle (well, Friends was not a favorite series of mine, mildly speaking). Jason Sudeikis was also ""higher into the air"", and both teen actors were not trivial cute-face types. Many ambiguous scenes were really funny, boosted by pleasant chemistry between all the so-called family members.Moreover, in spite of being a ""raw"" comedy, many topics approached were quite serious and actual, giving reasons to ponder on and over.

Surprisingly Funny!,"I thought We're the Millers was going to be another one of those stale road-trip comedies, but actually you can take the word stale out of the equation. It has a bashful, mean-spirited undertone, but the jokes work so well and this is the case where they are so mean, but so funny. A certain spider joke comes to mind. I also liked the concept of the film. Strangers working together to show themselves as a family to the public is a good topic to work on. I really enjoyed the film and to be honest, I would not say no to a sequel.Rawson Marshall Thurber's film is about a low-level drug dealer named David Clark who is assigned to travel to Mexico and smuggle marijuana. In order to keep suspicion away, David realizes he should travel with a ""family."" He gathers his stripper neighbor, Rose, a homeless thief named Casey, and his virgin neighbor, Kenny to be his fake family for the road.This film has a good cast and I think everyone had good, natural chemistry. Jason Sudeikis is often a mean guy, but is naturally funny. Jennifer Aniston is sexy hot in her role and is one of her better roles as of late. Emma Roberts is a good cast and is probably her raciest role to date. Finally, Will Poulter does a good job as he is the butt of my favorite jokes.Overall, We're the Millers is your modern, typical R-rated comedy but it's hilarious and the jokes work more often than not. I was surprised at the outcome, and I never thought I would be calling this the funniest film of Summer 2013. But indeed it was. From that spider joke to another joke involving lots of kissing, I really could not stop laughing. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Skip it unless you're really bored and believe anything.,Bad script. Cheap jokes. The characters have no chemistry. The acting is juvenile at best (not that they are acting juvenile rather their acting abilities reveal themselves as elementary). Anniston couldn't even outshine or carry the scene she shared with the young girl. The boy was unbelievably static. The young girl was probably the brighter of the cast though no saving grace. The writing was distasteful and the directing was dull and uninspiring. The guy playing the main character was somewhat funny in small doses in Horrible Bosses and Hall Pass but as a lead he relies way too much on a shotgun approach of vulgar language and sexual deviance with no cutoff point to let the manure air out & some humor to cultivate.,2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Just re-watch Friends.,"Another Jennifer Aniston rom-com? Yes, and with the same ingredients. We're the Millers is a comedy and, to say something nice about it, it contains its share of worthwhile moments and tiny pleasures. Some of the jokes are funny. If one was to compile all the good snippets and scenes into a highlight reel, it might run about six minutes. Unfortunately, the movie as a whole has a running time of 110 minutes. That means that, accounting for credits, there's close to 100 minutes of tedium to endure, which results in a mathematical ratio of 16:1 in favor of the drab, the monotonous, and the just plain boring. I think of a number of better ways to spend $10.

Genius road trip comedy film!,"'WE'RE THE MILLERS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Genius road trip comedy film about a pot dealer who hires a stripper, a neighbor kid and a homeless girl to pose as his family in order to smuggle drugs from Mexico into the U.S.. Jason Sudeikis stars as the drug dealer and Jennifer Aniston, Will Poulter (of 'SON OF RAMBOW' fame) and Emma Roberts co-star as his fake family. The film was directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber (who also directed the 2004 hit comedy film 'DODGEBALL: A TRUE UNDERDOG STORY') and written by Steve Faber, Bob Fisher, Sean Anders and John Morris. Faber and Fisher co-wrote the 2005 hit comedy film 'WEDDING CRASHERS' together and Anders and Morris co-wrote such hilarious comedy flicks as 'SEX DRIVE', 'SHE'S OUT OF MY LEAGUE' and 'HOT TUB TIME MACHINE' (they're two of my favorite comedy writers). The film is just a grade A production all around and it's hilarious!Sudeikis plays a pot dealer named David Clark who's been selling weed since he was a kid (and now does it for a living). He works for a rich drug lord named Brad Gurdlinger (Ed Helms) and when he's robbed (by three thugs) he loses a bunch of Gurdlinger's drugs and money as well as his own cash savings. Gurdlinger threatens to kill him for it unless he agrees to transfer a small amount of marijuana over the border for him (from Mexico into the U.S.). Clark reluctantly agrees and comes up with the idea of hiring people to pose as his family so he's not overly questioned (or searched) by authorities. He hires a down on her luck stripper named Rose (Aniston), who lives in his apartment building, to pose as his wife, a local homeless girl named Casey (Roberts) to pose as his teenage daughter and an 18-year-old boy named Kenny, who also lives in his building, to pretend to be his son (Kenny is also mostly to blame for David being robbed). Things go as planned at first but then they run into many complications and end up having ruthless drug dealers chasing them.The movie really surprised me! Watching the trailer and commercials for the film I thought it had a clever premise but didn't think it looked all that funny. Often the best comedy films don't sell that well though (but obviously this one did because it's making a killing at the Box Office. It just didn't sell that well to me, but I still went and saw it I guess). Thurber does a great job directing the film but I think it's the script that's even more impressive. It's just packed with great comedy setups and even better payoffs and all four of those writers are pros (especially Anders and Morris). The cast is probably what really makes the film work though. Sudeikis is quickly becoming one of my favorite comedic actors and he's great in this. Aniston does a lot of bad films but for such a popular actress she also does a surprising amount of good ones as well, especially clever and smart comedy films (and she's great in this too). Roberts is cute and effective here and Poulter really shines (he's a scene stealer).

If this is what Jennifer Aniston has stooped to in order to save a career that has essentially sucked since she left Friends, well, there's nowhere to go but up.

"A Fun Comedy with Great Chemistry between its Four Leads,","We're the Millers is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a terrific comedic cast. It's a very funny film, I don't think there was a single scene that didn't make me laugh at least once, it has a clever and original set up, there's nothing about it that feels cliché or overused for a typical comedy, it aimed to be different, not just to write a few jokes and make a lot of money. One thing I think was definitely missing from this film was more character arch, we really don't know anything about these characters before they head off on their journey, we learn a bit about David as he is the lead character, but even he feels underdeveloped. The cast is terrific, particularly the four leads Jason Sudekis, Jennifer Aniston, Emma Roberts and Will Poulter, they all come from very different acting backgrounds but all manage to fit in together very well in to this comedy, and the relationship that develops between them throughout is the highlight, the dynamics between them is outstanding. Countless laugh out loud moments and a terrific cast, We're the Millers makes up for most of what it lacks, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy.A marijuana dealer recruits a fake family in order to smuggle a shipment across the border without raising suspicion.Best Performance: Jason Sudekis",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"One of the funniest comedies of the year, all the inappropriate things you could possibly think of for a made up family!","I had seen the trailers for this movie the last few times I went to the cinema and I kind of had this written off as one of those movies that once you have seen the trailer, you have seen the best bits & the rest of the movie would be average. How wrong could I have been, this was a very entertaining movie & gave what the trailer promised and so much more. There were more laughs, plenty of one liners, and a decent story that didn't dry up as quickly as it could have. There is more to this movie than going along to watch Jennifer Aniston as a stripper!The story begins with a brief introduction of David (Jason Sudeikis), a drug dealer who seems to be cruising with his life, although something does seem missing for a 30 something guy, like a family of his own. After being cleared out of all his drugs & cash by a gang, his boss forces him to take a trip to Mexico to collect some marijuana. After a chance meeting in the street with a touring family, he comes up with a plan to get across the border without raising suspicion, by assembling a ""family"", consisting of himself, his stripper neighbour Rose (Jennifer Aniston), Young neighbour Kenny (Will Poulter) & runaway girl Casey (Emma Roberts) who then go on a family holiday, with hilarious consequences.The movie has a decent, possibly under the radar cast, with Jennifer Aniston being the big draw to watch the movie, but the talent shines through. I'd even go as far as to say that Jason Sudeikis should have the top billing, being the main character & for all the perfectly delivered lines throughout the entirety of the movie, he kept me laughing the whole time, as well as fellow cinema goers who were watching along with me. I enjoyed Jennifer Aniston's character, she & Jason's characters really did fit & mesh well between the funny & serious scenes, although I did feel she came across a little awkward in the scenes in the strip club, although I do believe this was more down to the character she was playing & not wanting to be there, more than how the actress performed. The supporting cast were all great too, all playing up to typical stereotypes, from the sleazy strip club owner Todd (Ken Marino), to drug lord Brad Gurdlinger (Ed Helms) all adding to the hilarity.Add to this already great mix of talented & seriously funny actors & a good, evolving storyline, a good & fitting soundtrack, you got yourself one of the best comedies of the summer, if not the year!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Best comedy in 2013,"Greetings from Lithuania.""We're the Millers"" is definitely the best comedy of this year, and i liked the ""Heat"". I'm not the fan of Jennifer Aniston, but she's quite good in this one. Many things work in this comedy, and i laughed very hard - and that is a rate thing. Jason Sudeikis (who's last name is Lithuania'n)is very good in this one, actually, everyone involved in this flick did a strong job. One thing i really liked about this comedy, that jokes aren't unnatural (hope you know what i mean), they are very natural and that's why they work an are funny. Overall, this is a very good R rated comedy. Beware - it's really R.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Solid job!  Give Sudeikis his props for this one!,"This movie stars Jason Sudeikis as a grown adult who's still selling drugs for a career, winds up in some serious debt to his supplier/old high school buddy-turned millionaire, and takes on a crazy scheme to smuggle a ""smidge"" of drugs over the border from Mexico. He enlists the help of a stripper (Jen Aniston), a nerdy kid, and a runaway girl to pose as his family for the trip.If you were judging this movie by the commercials and trailers, you'd think that the main draw to the movie was Aniston's 'striptease' scene. And you'd be wrong...this movie is pretty damn funny.Pros:-Jason Sudeikis kills. This is his best film yet. I had my doubts on whether or not he was strong enough to handle a lead role, but he put those worries to rest.-Jennifer Aniston has definitely been taking on raunchier roles these days, but she doesn't feel out of place in the slightest. She does a solid joband the striptease ain't bad, either (You'll notice a little bit of fourth-wall breaking during that scene, which was perfectly done.)-Ed Helms is hilarious. He needs more work.-Kudos go to the writers on this one – all the jokes are spot-on, and the movie has a great flow to it.Cons:-If you were hoping to get some nuditywell, you get it, but probably not the type you were looking for-If you're not into the raunchy stuff, then you probably won't be a big fan. Definitely think twice before bringing any childrenOverall, I was pleasantly surprised by how good this was. Everyone nailed their roles, and it pays off in a pretty fun ride.We're The Millers scores a 4 out of 5 on the BDBOS.Make sure you stick around for the blooper reel, right before the credits.

funny,"I enjoyed watching this movie because it was so funny. It kept me laughing from the beginning to the end. In my opinion all of the characters matched great. The plot of the story is crazy to think about and the characters made the plot even better. The characters fed off each other and seemed to make the film even more funny. I couldn't stop laughing. This film was amazing and it was spread out perfectly, it made it seem like the jokes never ended.

Unexpected Enjoyment,"Okay, my expectations for We're the Millers wasn't too high when I went to see it. And granted, some of it is overly crude and too gross, but a lot of it is laugh out loud funny, too. This is not a movie that's going to win any awards, but it is not a bad movie if you just want to be entertained for an hour or soand are not a kid. This is not a movie for kids, but for grownups who aren't the sort to be put off by a few of the scenes, it's a funny film. And I don't suppose those folks are going to be interested in seeing a picture like this anyway, so.. At any rate, it's refreshing to see something that isn't geared to the teenage mindset, brimming over with vampires, or moronic party, party, party time, or the sort slam-bang full of non-stop violence as to make your head hurt, so that I quite enjoyed myself for the most part. Like I said, a few scenes I could have done without but then, nobody asked me about the content, or how to present it, when it was filmed. Jennifer Aniston continues to prove what a delight she is. She's one of the few actresses who appeal to both male and female viewers. The males for obvious reasons and the females because , although she is gorgeous, it's the rare version of beauty that isn't threatening because she IS so very likable. The perfect star for a comedy movie. And Jason Sudeikis is terrific. Just perfect for comedy and yet has the ability to carry serious moments equally as well. This had a fun plot, if one can get past the drug-running aspect of it, and after all, it's only a movie, so why not? Had some good music with Will Poulter, who played the 'son' super doing his thing to Waterfall. All in all, better than you'd expect and a dandy opportunity for some laughs.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Funny Family,"David finds his group of unlikely family members. Rose (Aniston) is a stripper in need of some cash to pay her rent. Casey (Roberts) is an independent homeless girl, and Kenny (Poulter) is an 18 yr. old without a lot of intelligence or life experience. Throw them altogether in an RV and you get a pretty funny family who sometimes has a difficult time convincing others that they truly are a family. As the film progresses though, they start to care for each other and stick up for each other as many real family members do. There are some instances when I watch a movie that the movie does not have to be great to feel great. After spending all day with the kids and staying quite busy, this movie was truly a vacation and paid off in every way possible. It was predictable and by the book, and pretty R rated, but definitely funny and worth the escape. It's definitely not going to win any awards, despite the humorous attempt during the credits, but shouldn't disappoint.The good: The casting worked pretty well here. Although Sudeikis doesn't have much experience being a ""leading"" man, he once again doesn't really have to ""lead"" here. He has a pretty good supporting cast most of the time and Aniston more than holds her own. I'm not sure what's funnier, the family trying to blend as a family, Clark constantly making fun of his family members, or Kenny being Kenny. Although predictable, the formula struck often and worked most of the time for me.The bad: Was it predictable? Yes. Is that bad? Depends if you want something you can rely on to be funny. Most of the punch lines and jokes that I was wanting or expecting came up. There were a few parts where they could've gone for more realism, or more laughs but it was adequate. Plot holes? Yes please. Also, Clark leaves his family behind at one point and it takes him all of 5 minutes and a silent RV to realize he misses his fake family.The ugly: Nothing too ugly here except a nasty spider bite. I will provide no more details about this.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
It has weak plot points just to make this whole story happen.,"If Will Poulte's character didn't exist the entire situation would have never been feasible. Which isn't all that bad considering every other bad comedy. But honestly, it just left me saying ""who does that?"" or ""no one can be that stupid and it not be a concern to others."" I am not saying anything negative about the kid's acting. Just this story is bad. It doesn't ""whisp me away"" like a film should. It keeps me firmly planted in reality AKA the place I am trying to take a break from by watching a movie.All because of those weak plot points that had to be included just to make this whole story happen.

Pot heads will love it,"Jason Sudakis from Saturday Night Live plays a pot dealer who adopts a family for smuggling trip to Mexico to pay off a debt when his loot is stolen one night. Jennifer Aniston plays Rose, his stripper wife, fully clothed and tanned throughout. She will do any film as long as the pay is good, I guess. Kenny, the son, always has a fixed wrinkle on his forehead nearly to the point of being mongoloid. He has the worst gags of anybody, swollen genitals from a tarantula bite only the least of them. Violence and profanity are overdone to the point of not being that funny. Seriously, the cast is too clean goody-two-shoes to resemble any of the Millers they are supposed to portray. It feels like an extended episode of Saturday Night Live and any comparison to the similar Chevy Chase Vacation series would be an insult, since those films had good characters driven to bad ends instead of the reverse. Jen's strip tease scene the only positive quality I can locate in the whole movie.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
I loved it!,"I don't know where to start. This isn't the best comedy I have ever watched nor is it a masterpiece but it was extremely fun to watch and I did not get bored at all as I sat through it. This is currently the best comedy flick out in theaters though, with Kick Ass 2 more along the same level as it.So this is why I liked this movie. First of all, it was light-hearted. It wasn't something you had to pay full attention to or would miss out a massive amount of detail from missing a small scene. The story-line was simple, easy to follow and the movie was bright so this was something very comfortable to watch.Secondly, the comedy is this movie was of course very funny. Use of obscene activity was not over done like in The Hangover (which was still a very nice movie though). The comedy in this movie is very dumb (not as dumb as Family Guy) but that's actually a good thing. Anybody can understand and it uses a lot of comedy as well good, old fashioned slapstick comedy.The acting in this movie was exceptional. I mean, the roles in the movie didn't need such major acting skills. Everybody gave a believable performance and that was a good thing.Lastly, Jennifer Aniston!9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Disappointing Despite Great Potential,"I like ""dumb"" comedies sometime, such as ""Bad Grandpa"", and I had high hopes for this one, based on the description and some acquaintances recommendations. But unfortunately, despite some funny moments early on, for me the laughs were few and far between. Jennifer Aniston was largely wasted in her role, and the casual graphic sex talk got old after a while. The highlights, as another reviewer noted, were the outtakes during the credits, and the ""cute"" moments with Kenny (Will Poulter), whose eyebrows are rather unique. Too many of the supporting cast were caricatures, especially the bad guys, be they the killers or the one who gave Sudeikis the job of bringing the drugs back to Denver from Mexico. The humor should come from the situations and the script, not from silly overacting and mugging. Not awful, but it should have been funnier, and about 15 minutes shorter.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"Spoiler-free - Great Idea, Inconsistent Results","The basic concept for this film is really strong, and could have easily been fleshed out into a knock-out comedy TV series. Like Arrested Development crossed with Breaking Bad.Because the pretend family members don't care about or really know each other, they end up treating each other horribly and looking even more like a real family than they're pretending to be. Put this situation in Mexico, throw in a drug-deal and some tense border crossing scenes, and its sit-com gold.Unfortunately the edgy, un-PC, laugh-out-loud humour quickly fades once this set-up resolves, about a third of the way in. Then it seems to ramble on forward, finding more excuses to fulfil a feature-length running time. The humour moves from modern/edgy, to 80's family/sentimental, which pulls down the overall vibes of the film.If it had spent more time in Mexico and with the drugs plot, kept the humour witty and more over-the-top, it could have been an absolute comedy classic.Its like it lost faith itself - which is a real shame, because the first third is great. I really don't think that the kind of people who enjoy the first third are going to care about the sentimental, corny character developments, and vice-versa.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Only funny if you're severely stoned and/or mentally challenged,"So a friend with similar movie tastes to mine was very excited about this film. It hadn't even entered my radar, so I was quietly hopeful I might have an undiscovered gem on my hands. And when I read it was a stoner-action-comedy from director Marshall Rawson Thurber (Dodgeball) and writer Bob Fisher (Wedding Crashers), I was positively salivating! Cue: massive disappointment (and re-evaluation of a friendship).The film starts promisingly enough. David (Sudeikis) is a middle-aged, middle-class, white-as-can-be pot dealer, looking for his big score. He devises a plan to ship a truckload of ganja across the Mexico-US border, and to allay any suspicion, recruits a bunch of misfits (including a pole-dancing Aniston) to pose as his fake suburban family.While the premise is relatively original, it can't make up for the incredibly one-dimensional characters, poor dialogue, and cheap attempts at laughs that cater to the lowest common denominator Come to think of it, I don't know why I expected anything better. The fact that the protagonist is played by Jason Sudeikis (who? exactly) should have been a big red flag.So if you're 13 years old and are a fan of such paragons of comedy like Two And A Half Men and The Big Bang Theory, then you'll probably love this pile of faeces. Otherwise, don't waste your time.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
One of the best comedy reviews ever,Horrible Bosses is a great movie and also stars Jennifer Aniston and Jason Sudeikis who in this play Rose O'Reilly and David Clark. David is a drug dealer who makes a family all with interesting characteristics (of course) which is really funny and at times a but cringe-worthy but great all the while. Funny plot twists keep you on the edge of your seat and the way characters deal with that is very amusing.

Decent Movie and Good Laughs,"When this movie came out my first reaction was, it's gonna bomb. I underestimated Jennifer Annistons appeal. The movie started off good and I found myself laughing, sometimes hard. It's a decent script, not great and the performances are decent as well. The movie holds up, though there are moments that really feel contrived. However, it's about the journey and this road trip movie was pretty good. Jason S is capable, Jennifer too, the supporting cast however, are the true gems of the movie. The 'kids' are spot on, and when TLC's ""Waterfalls"" plays...its hilarious. The second half of the movie begins to lose steam as it becomes predictable but again, there were enough laughs that the dull parts don't last long. All in all, I thought it was worth watching, it was funny and the story, again, is decent.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Surely the most under rated comedy ever,"We're The Millers is one of the few films I revisit at least once every year because they're awesome.

But this little gem of a film I love because it's brilliant and fantastically side hurtingly funny. It probably shouldn't be as the story isn't anything special (although the script is) but the cast is magnificent. Jason Sudeikis and Will Poulter (particularly Will Poulter) are superb as are several other main cast members. Jennifer Aniston is probably miscast but better than expected.But this film is great because, despite the drug dealing storyline, it's an old fashioned feel good story of the goodies overcoming the baddies.

The NBC alums save this promising comedy from totally drowning,"With a terrible cast, this movie would have been a downright disaster.With an excellent cast, this movie would have been mediocre.We're the Millers has a decent cast, and it almost saves the movie from being a weak summer comedy with an intriguing premise. Unfortunately the script was too distorted, the laughs were too far in between, and there is a cringe factor and an unnecessary force-fed sentimental taint that doesn't allow for the insane movie to breathe. For a unique movie (Four different people posing as a family to cross the border with drugs), this movie has a lot of clichés. Tons of awkward sex jokes, tons of awkward sexual moments, and all the minimal clichés you see in tired and effortless comedies clutter this overblown production.But like I said before, the cast definitely makes up for most of the shortcomings. Jason Sudeikis has the charm to cover the general disgusting personality of his character. Jennifer Aniston has enough appeal to cover the all-to-common stripper-with-heart-of-gold routine (and enough to spread around all of California). The rest of the cast does pretty well with the material they are given, with special nods to Nick Offerman. Even after the comedy rolls past 100 minutes (News to Comedic Writers: comedies should never run past 90 minutes unless you really have a good concept) you will warm up enough to the cast to care about their whereabouts.The movie's idea could have definitely worked as a stoner road comedy.Instead, the movie comes off as disjointedly sex-driven and unnecessarily crude comedy whose main McGuffin becomes a pure afterthought. For a movie about a drug dealer, they definitely cut back on drug humor while focusing more on the male anatomy. Well, this is what happens when four different people write the script. Although Rawson Marshall Thurber didn't fumble the directing job, he didn't add any style or cleverness to the film.We're The Millers does have its laughs; it does have its moments, and underneath the drudge has a hintage of charm. But, between these positives are plenty of negatives including inconsistency, too much of the crude humor, and its smuggling of clichés. Similar to Identity Thief, this movie can actually benefit from a remake down the road and not because of the quality of the original, but because of the promising premise that tumbled upon arrival.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Very good surprise,"At first, when seeing the contrast between the press ratings and the public ratings, one wonders if the professionals snubbed a bit too much the movie as they did with 21 Jump Street, who has a similar rating distribution. And indeed, you realize that We're The Millers is far much better than the critics tried to convince us. The concept is simple but strong and leads to the immediate adhesion of the viewer. The dialogues are incisive and the gags, based on quid pro quos and other situational comedy, are for the most part very funny. Still, one could regret a slight slow-down towards after the ""family"" gets the RV back at the garage, which is a bit unfortunate since the rest is so dynamic, but it's minor and ultimately, the movie turns out to be a very good surprise.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Pretty Good, Pretty Funny Pretty Normal, and a Good Feeling at the End","Spoilers Not the funniest movie, I ever saw. This movie is good, but not outstanding, except that, you know the ending all along and are still pretty happy to see it. The ending is a reaffirmation of the love and mark of a real family and it makes this movie worth while. Some might say the ending is corny, but I still like it. As the movie and the comedy roll on, and Jennifer Aniston gets to play still another woman who is not the main love focus but somehow through the plot, becomes the loved one, we get the affirmation we wait for. The family begins to bond, to care, to show they are really a very functional and unstoppable group when united. We know that its coming, and we wait for it. We hope for it. It happens. The magic of Hollywood takes over and we get the very functional loving family made out of people who could not have cared less about each other in the beginning. Of course, like other movies that do similar feel good things, we get the almost obvious but still a little surprising reason they will remain a loving family at the end.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

I was looking for easy fun while smoking but it didn't provide even that. Most of the jokes went absolutely flat during the delivery. One funny irony noticed during the movie is that they deal in huge amounts of marijuana and no one smokes. At any point in the movie. That was original, except for the rest of the movie is all typical romcom cliché one after another. And when you think it cannot get any more dumb, it does and not in a good way. It is not even the kind of movie that it so dumb its funny. Unfortunately this one is just dumb. The romantic part of the movie is also annoyingly bad follows the usual cliché , but somehow always at the wrong times.

"Total laugh riot, up there with Hangover","I watched this movie on DVD at home and I was recently recovering from Pneumonia which caused me pain every time I laughed, changed breathing, burped and hiccuped -- and this was totally the WRONG movie to watch. I laughed so hard and uncontrollably I was literally in pain. Every situation is drop-dead hilarious that this movie should come with a health warning.What makes this so hilarious is the genuinely funny plot and the situations; a drug dealer, a stripper, a virgin and run-away hobo girl pose as a happy American happy family(father, wife, brother, sister) and hire out a mobile home/family van to smuggle drugs across US-Mexico border. A million things can go wrong course, and they do, but they are not what you expect! The real comedy is in the situations our lead characters get themselves into and you think ""Now, are they are going to get themselves out of that""This is also a road trip movie and so it has a lot of character bondings over the trip, and as a nod to it more tender moments, the ragtag family actually comes together as a real family at times and it is believable because the cast bounce of each other so well.The comedy is strictly adult and relies heavily on explicit verbal sexual humour and bad language, and to some this might be offensive, but I felt in this this case toning down the sex and bad language quotient would have worked against the characterization; our characters are straight of the street and uncouth. It makes one for one comic situation when they are getting on a plane(as a family) and relax their pretence. This also in turn plays a into a group character arc, as we see what the family was like at the beginning and what is towards the end.Last time I laughed this much was in Hangover.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
An enjoyable journey through an implausible plot,"I watched this on the strength of Jennifer Aniston's performance in a 'Life of Crime' (worth a watch!). Not a comedy per se, but a great vehicle for demonstrating the breadth of Aniston's acting. However, I digress.'We're the Millers' has great ensemble casting here, that means the jokes work well. The sightly implausible plot plays to the ridiculousness of the situations the family find themselves in. It's all good. Worth a try ;-)",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"So, so bad","Whatever contract Jennifer Aniston signed that wound her up in the unequivocal flop Just Go with It must have tied her to this piece of trash. Granted, I actually sat through the entire movie, so it is better than her Adam Sandler creation.The premise is terrible. If Jennifer Aniston hadn't been in it, I never ever would have seen it. The tagline: ""A veteran pot dealer creates a fake family as part of his plan to move a huge shipment of weed into the U.S. from Mexico."" Included in the fake family is a stripper as the mother, a runaway girl, and a teenage virgin boy. I have a problem with this. The label ""virgin"" is an insult now? This teenage boy has to act like an imbecile, just because he isn't worldy wise? And for that matter, not having sex doesn't make you unwordly, just as having sex doesn't bestow you with common sense. During one scene, the ""family"" is listening to the radio, and a rap song starts. The idiotic virgin starts rapping along. He knows all the lyrics, and the rest of the family is awed and impressed. It's supposed to be funny, but I found it offensive and even racist.If you like really stupid, off-color comedies that basically promote drug use, you might find this funny. Just one last question: who told Jennifer Aniston it was a good idea to play a stripper? Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to the drug content, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

No light comedy has or ever will top this movie,"I have watched many many TV shows and movies that I have absolutely loved and never wrote a single review. After rewatching this We're The Millers for the 7th time, I had to share why I think this movie simply cannot be topped. Although - like most light comedies - the general story is predictable, they manage to make the absolute best choices for scenarios the characters face, the things they say while facing them, and the consistent mini resolutions. I can comfortably say that this movie possibly has the greatest character arcs; every character story is perfectly fulfilled, with no lazy or skipped-over plot points. The start builds the core of each of the characters' dilemmas and imperfections, and throughout the movie they are slowly explored and finally solved. The script, language, body language, and chemistry (between the characters), plays out flawlessly in every scene of this movie.As I mentioned, I have rewatched this movie 7 times, and have never gotten bored of it; if anything, the reason I am writing this review (as my first ever), is because through my many rewatches, I keep exploring newer features and elements that I adore in this movie. 10/10, and if you did not think so then wait a couple months and rewatch it.

"Stupid and utterly ridiculous so called ""comedy""","Another comedy from Hollywood that tries to go for risqué (a drug dealer, a stripper - unbelievably played by the aging Aniston, a troubled runaway girl and a clueless idiot of a boy all dabbling in international drug smuggling) that could have gone for the jugular but only ends up biting its own lip before passing out.This tale of a drug dealer who looses his stash during a robbery, is then unable to pay back the supplier which results in him drafting in his neighbors as they cross over to Mexico in a camper van with the intention of smuggling vast amounts of weed back into the States under the guise of one big happy family results in a film that should have been funny but only ends up not being funny at all.We're the Millers has possibly one or two chuckles that register about a five on the laugh meter but that's it when it comes to the comedy department.

The interaction between the four main leads is great. It's a little too raunchy to be a movie for all the family and there are a few gross-out moments and some of it is clichéd, but it does go beyond your average comedy.

A Thoroughly Enjoyable Fare!,"We're The Millers is a comedy that is not meant to be taken seriously. It features Jason Sudekis in the lead role of a small- time drug dealer and Jennifer Aniston as a stripper. Now, this guy gets the opportunity to go to Mexico and smuggle some drugs to the United States in exchange for 100 Grand. David undertakes this risky mission and realizes that he will be less suspicious if he went to Mexico with a family.To form his fake family, he hires Rose the stripper, his teenage neighbor and a homeless girl who reluctantly agrees to be a part of this mission for 1000 dollars. The fake family is disguised as The Millers.For the majority of the movie, we follow the crazy, reckless adventures that involve threats to their lives by drug cartels. The film derives its humor from the conversations that the characters have with each other.We're The Millers has its flaws but it works as it does not try to be anything other than what it is, that is, a mindless comedy.

Beyond awesome!,"This is one of the most entertaining movies I've seen in a very long time. I saw We're the millers without knowing what to expect since I haven't seen the trailer and haven't heard any of my friend's thoughts on this movie. This movie is basically about 4 people, a drug dealer, a goofy kid, a stripper, and a runaway girl, who are in a mission to smuggle an RV loaded with drugs all the way from Mexico to the United States of America. The idea is for them to act as if they are a family on a family vacation to Mexico, since hardly anyone suspects a typical American family. We're the millers is one of the funniest comedies. I laughed at all the scenes and jokes, and i don't find things funny easily. The story line was original and fun, and it was executed brilliantly. You keep guessing what's going to happen next excitedly. The jokes are very vulgar and some scenes were rather disturbing, but i love them. The other thing that makes me love this movie is the actors. There are so many familiar faces and they are all really talented comedians. Brava to them.

There was even moments of suspense and even if it was a bit silly I think it worked (the marijuana bags, search scene, etc.).

Also the movie is with a surprisingly amazing cast of actors and actresses (whom I hardly knew before the movie, except Rose). Everyone's character was very fittingly chosen and played, even the Fitzgeralds' and Scottie P.

Millers versus the killers,"Surprised adventure-comedy of the year. 'We're the Millers' tells about a fake family who are trying to smuggle the drugs from Mexico to United states. David is a single who is a drug distributor in small scale. One day his boss makes a deal with him after he was robbed by the street boys that he must bring a huge shipment from across the border. So he makes a team with the struggling stripper, homeless girl and abandoned boy as a fake family called Millers. The rest of the movie was full of fun adventures on the road.A simple predictable concept with the potential theme to make the movie at its best. How could no one ever thought this kinda story before. The movie was nothing special except the unique lead four characters. Each performance was good, individually they all gave the life to the movie. Surprised to see 43 year-old Jennifer Aniston as a stripper. It might be about a family's road adventure but not suitable for the family audience especially the kids.One of the best road movie in the form of unusual movie characters but same old adventures and comedy. Some of the scenes were nice which really brings the wide laughs out from us. The story might deal about the smuggling drug but in the presentation you will witness that no one consumes it. Yeah, kinda weird way a movie to get a rating R other than semi nude from the Aniston. A cool comedy, I recommend it for its rare and originality concept.7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Saw it in theaters twice,"First viewing was me and my boyfriend opening week. We loved it! It was hilarious and overall a good movie.Second showing was last Friday night we were hanging out with my friend and got bored so we looked at the movie show times at our local theater and saw ""We're The Millers"" was still playing (2 months after release)as soon as we saw that we got ready for the next showing. Me and the boyfriend were more than happy to go watch it again and my friend hadn't seen it yet but wanted to.She as well loved it.It really is a good comedy and I don't care what other people think on the matter. Just here in my town new movies have come and gone and as I said its still playing here and scheduled for all day show times and should be here for a few more weeks. The employees at the theater said they sell more tickets to it than the other movies playing. Its just good!The script is well written and clever. Cast is great. Jennifer Aniston plays a stripper, can't get much better than that! I found it to be a unique idea for a movie. I hear a lot of people saying its generic... While it may follow a formula that many comedies do it still stands on its own. I mean maybe I missed the flood of movies where a drug dealer has to recruit a fake family to accompany him to Mexico and smuggle in marijuana and then hilarity ensues? Otherwise I don't see how its generic. The jokes aren't reused. And its very quotable! We've been quoting the movie all weekend.Being natives of North Carolina it was also cool for us to see the scenes filmed in one of our favorite vacation spots, Wilmington NC and places we've been to on the big screen. Like the scene where Jason Sudeikis is in the café was filmed at a great coffee shop Port City Java they had turned into a diner for the scene.I've seen forgettable movies but to me this isn't one. We enjoyed it enough to make it to theaters twice to see it. I'm not afraid to recommend this movie and if you didn't like it or choose not to see it. Well, that's your loss. If you have a sense of humor and the heart of a kid go see it and enjoy the little perks of life like a good comedy. It made me laugh, smile and the ending was sweet.

The group of characters together shouldn't work but does in the best possible way. Jennifer Aniston at her best, in my opinion, she is full of enough whit and sarcastic comments to make her character actually likable.

The characters were properly cast, really makes a huge difference when they have on screen chemistry. How could a family so wrong seems so right?? Kenny, man I hope this guy appears in more films in similar roles. Don't want him to be typecast but he just has the features for comedy. I read somewhere Jason Bateman was supposed to play the lead male role, while I enjoy his work I think they were right in casting Jason Sudekis instead. This guy has that likable douche thing going on for him, and hey he's shagging Olivia Wilde so he's definitely doing something right.

"Some raunchy, over-the-top fun!","If you're a fan of Jason Sedeikis, then you're in for a real treat with this film. I love him in ""Ted Lasso"" but this guy has made an absolute boatload of other great films over the years. And a good deal of them are comedies. This little gem is truly laugh-out-loud funny.David (Sedeikis) is a pot dealer. While all of his college buddies have moved on, he's still stuck in his old ways. One day he gets robbed and owes his supplier, played by Ed Helm, a ton of money. He's forced to go down to Mexico and bring back a shipment of dope. So he concocts this hair-brained idea to rent an RV, and head south of the border with a made-up family. His make-believe family includes Rose (Jennifer Anniston) a stripper who pretends to be his wife. I've never seen Ms. Anniston this foul-mouthed before. I think it's one of the best parts she's played. It turns out to be one of the whackiest road trip films I've ever seen. While on the road he encounters another couple, played by Nick Offerman (""Parks and Rec"") and Katheryn Hahn. And the film takes so many twists and turns you never see coming.

"Sometimes funny, still raunchy and has uncomfortable moments","David (Jason Sudeikis) sells Weed on a small scale. His boss Brad (Ed Helms) needs him to go to Mexico and bring back a ""smidgen"" of pot. David agrees but decides to take a fake family with him so the Mexican Border Officials only see a family on vacation in an RV. Fake family consists of wife: Rose (Jennifer Aniston) who is a stripper; son: Kenny (Will Poulter), and daughter: Casey (Emma Roberts).If it weren't for the some uncomfortable moments, and raunchy sex talk this would have been pretty good. But, Hollywood insists on Raunch thinking that is what most people want to see in a ""comedy."" Maybe they are right as most comedies these days contain volumes of Raunch and all become millionaires.I do have to admit there were some honest comedic moments when Raunch wasn't involved and I chuckled at times. And, I have new respect for Jason Sudeikis as he can carry a movie. I can see where he could become a pretty good dramatic or RomCom actor if given an opportunity. He is not a comedian by any stretch. He along with Jennifer Aniston did pretty good despite her mouthing F-words mostly in the beginning.But, you must know about some uncomfortable moments. A Mexican policeman wants $1000.00 or oral sex to let the ""family"" pass. Not having the USD, David selects Kenny to do the deed until David realizes the policeman meant he wants 1,000 Pesos, not USD and David gives the policeman the equivalent of 1,000 Pesos (about $80) and the policeman goes on his way.On the way back to the US, the ""family"" meets up with the Fitzgeralds who have some troubles in their sex life. There is an encounter whereby we thought we were going to see wife-swapping or something close to that. Turns out Mrs Fitzgerald (Kathryn Hahn) just feels Rose's breasts through her blouse and that ended as a first step to solving the Fitzgeralds' problem. Still this was quite uncomfortable as we didn't know how long this would go on.The other uncomfortable moment comes when Kenny gets bitten on his genitals by a spider. And, I really didn't think they would show his genitals, but they did. This was to show Rose how bad it was and she needs to decide if he should go to a hospital. And, it is bad and they do take Kenny to a hospital.Those moments above were the most uncomfortable and if it weren't for them and the language, this could have been a fun movie. There is a twist no one saw coming mostly because I believe the 4-writers of this mess couldn't come up with any more uncomfortable moments. Hence we get to see some real action stunts with vehicles.I know I let the cat out of the bag with the uncomfortable moments above, but you had to know about them especially if you decide to watch with children.

Plenty of fun and laughter with the Millers,"Jason Sudeikas and Jennifer Aniston have both proved to possess ingenious comedic caliber over the years, with Sudeikas giving off a hilarious vibe in 'Horrible Bosses' co- starring with Jason Bateman and Charlie Day, and the latter in the ever-popular sitcom 'Friends'. It is little surprise these two stars make a successful comedic duo in this road comedy directed by Rawson Marshall Thurbar, the man behind the hilarious 'Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story'. Jason Sudeikas plays David Clark, a long-time pot dealer making a living salary off of selling marijuana. This is until one day he tasked by his boss Brad Gurdlinger (played by Ed Helms) with a highly dangerous assignment: pick up a large load of pot from Mexico and smuggle it into the U.S. Fearing the suspicion of authority officials of traveling alone with a mass amount of pot, David assembles a fake family consisting of his neighbor and local stripper Rose O'Reilly (played by Jennifer Aniston) as his wife, teenage social outcast Casey (played by Emma Roberts) and geeky teenage boy Kenny (played by Will Poulter) as his children in pretend of a family vacationing for the Fourth of July. As you might have guess, things don't go quite as they may expected and result in them running into some trouble, along with an unexpected acquaintance of the Fitzgeralds, a family of threeIn today's realm of stoner comedies, characters often take advantage of a mass variety of drug-related dialogue and humor, and off-the-wall situations of characters on pot usage. This movie in the other hand, takes a slightly different route. With plenty of gut-busting humor thrown around and about by the cast and surprisingly original jokes that don't come too often, viewers are in for an entertaining ride down the comedic lane. Enter the two leads Jason Sudeikas and Jennifer Aniston and we are already introduced with a solid comedic duo, thought not on the lines with others like Jonah Hill and Michael Cera in 'Superbad' or Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly in 'Step Brothers'. Then there is Emma Roberts and Will Poulter as the teenager characters. These actors come together to form a strong, hilarious comedic chemistry, and there are many scenes to prove it. One scene in particular involves a Mexican police officer, plenty of laughs are offered here. As the film nears a two-hour runtime, the characters do take a rather long time on their drug smuggling mission and so get involved in some overly recycled road comedy clichés, so the fun and laughter does fall short in a few areas, including a scene featuring Jennifer Aniston performing a strip dance. Fortunately, the film manages to make it work for most of the time and there is rarely a dull moment lying around here.We're The Millers is a hilarious comedy that leaves good notes on the careers of Jason Sudeikas and Jennifer Aniston as well as director Rawson Marshall Thurbar. This film is a must-watch for those seeking time of laughter and fun. Yes, there are some especially crude moments, one in particularly involves frontal nudity so take caution. Otherwise, this comedic picture is worth your attention.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"Funny, Funny and more funny!","Have to admit, I never thought Jason Sudeikis was that funny, But this movie changed my mind.This family came together and made me laugh a lot. Jennifer Aniston is her usual great self. It was not just a comedy it was a pretty well written story as well.If you love comedy's I think you will love this one.My philosophy is don't expect to much going into the movie and you should be fine.Do yourself a favor and watch this movie, you'll love it! Why you still on this review? Go watch it!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Family in disguise,"Now here's a comedy that is raunchy and flat-out all the way through! ""We're the Millers"" delivers all the mixbag humor designated for Friday Night viewers. I was less expecting it to be a successful one, but I guess I failed. It is one of the best comedy films of the year, promising a great set of cast including Jason Sudeikis.One of the reasons I trust the potential of this movie is its director Rawson Marshall Thurber (""Dodgeball""). After the disappointment of his last offering ""The Mysteries of Pittsburgh"", Thurber goes back in directing a script written by two writers of Wedding Crashers and the two writers of Sex Drive, which were also good comedies. The film proves to be the director's knack of making comedies than shifting to drama. Better yet, there will be more of Thurber in this genre in the future.Jason Sudeikis stars as David Clark a small time pot dealer who gets over in his head. And to get out from under, he's got to smuggle a ton of Marijuana from Mexico across the border back to Colorado. To do that, he hires a local stripper Rose (Jennifer Aniston), a homeless runaway girl Casey (Emma Roberts), and a nerd who lives in his apartment building Kenny (Will Poulter) to pretend to be his family. They rent a recreational vehicle, call themselves ""The Miller Family"" to make it successfully in Mexico. But will things go as planned? Who knows? At least nobody in the cast is gleeful enough to consume marijuana, just plenty of bumps along the way.The script flirts with subtle humor but not getting too far. The offbeat dialogue and wicked sense of humor doesn't run out of steam. You may laugh on how screwed up a fake family which turns out to be drug smugglers, but the film doesn't take the serious issue of this crime. Instead, it is masked with deliberate sarcasm for the sake of getting even and willing to cope.I consider the stars a Dream Cast. Sudeikis as a pot dealer is new for me. Every single quips of his part is packed with energy and absurdity even in dire situations. The same goes with Aniston as a stripper, though I do not consider her to be the good Rose in the film. However, the striptease scene felt crazy than wild. Will Poulter and Emma Roberts shares a rigorous chemistry as fake siblings. Poulter is the exact guy I liked to be the nerdy type, well nerdy might involve being a virgin or singing Waterfalls by TLC. Ed Helms as the billionaire boss is the weakest link perhaps. He's not as funny as he was in the Hangover Trilogy.We're the Millers indeed is surprisingly funny with a great ensemble. Hands down, it is one of the best comedy films of this year. Hollywood may have run out of ideas, but everyone wants a good throwback of the recent funniest and less broad comedies of the past few years. You're in for a ""Miller"" treat.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

If you've seen the trailer...,"While the movie had a great cast, and good chemistry among them, I can't recommend this movie for those wanting to see it. It wasn't a horrible movie, but it was no where near as good as the trailers let on to be. Furthermore, If you've seen the trailer (more so the red-band trailer) for this movie, then you've seen the entire thing. Not horrible, but literally not one single part in the movie came as a surprise, as I had seen it a thousand times on TV-spots and trailers. They also played it too safe, in my opinion; they should have taken it to the next level like The Heat. I'm not saying that movie was amazing, but they had some pretty off-side scenes that made the movie worthwhile. Good cast, but not worth the money.

I figured out what the producer wanted,"Now this isn't a true review because I could not stomach watching this entire movie. Bored during an NFL game's commercial breaks, I flipped over and saw several short segments of this movie.What I think I figured out is that the producer set out to see if he could succeed in making the absolute worst comedy movie in the history of film.What I saw were the lamest joke lines, the most reprehensible characters, and the crudest attempts at humor I ever saw.I think three of the six segments I tried to watch were so bad, I couldn't even stick with it for two minutes--I switched back to see the commercials before they went back to the game.The game was one of the most boring NFL games I've seen in years, but I'd rather watch the complete game replay six times this week than endure another 10 minutes of this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Movie Goes Soft Though Language Remains Strong,"A drug dealer, a stripper, a runaway and a square pretend to be a family in order to smuggle drugs into the country. What could go wrong? That's the premise of the movie, so what about the movie itself? I'm going to sound a bit insensitive if not depraved and immoral with this review but here it goes.The movie could have been better if they didn't go with the piano-playing-heartfelt-moments. If you're sitting down to watch a comedy involving the aforementioned players and the aforementioned plot and every one of them has a potty mouth you're not looking for some deep message in the movie. What's funny is that the message wasn't necessarily that drugs are bad, or being a drug dealer or a stripper or..., but that having a family is important. The importance of having a family, or having people you can love and trust in general is a great message, but it sooooo didn't fit here.These four characters gathered together sheerly for money (well three of them did anyway) yet somewhere along their wild road trip they develop a special bond that transcended money. Umm... not what I was looking for. Honestly, I was looking for a purely absurd comedy. Why? Because the concept in and of itself is absurd. Four outcasts pretending to be a family to smuggle drugs; that is the definition of absurd. And the movie started out ridiculous enough, and I mean ridiculous in a good way. Then, somewhere in the middle, they decided to slip in a not-so subtle message that was less believable than the entire plot. It was a very weak move.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Sure to make you laugh quite a lot.,"While being completely flimsy in the practicality of the plot but utterly funny, We're the Millers will sure to make you laugh quite a lot.David Clark is a small time pot dealer in the neighborhood. But his title is about to change to drug smuggler after he is unintentionally pulled to a wicked plot to smuggle weed over the Mexican border. While trying to figure out the best way to accomplish his assignment he realizes that a happy family on vacation is the way to go. So he gathers up few individuals and set up the fake family the Millers. But the drug smuggling business turns out to be tougher than he expected.The plot is one good reason for making this movie watchable. It throws out some instant yet funny twists now and then. And as mentioned before the humor (mostly adult) is good. Thought it puts this movie on the long list of movies that actually make jokes about sexuality to make an impression it does work here. But this is not another American Pie or 21 Jump Street. It's not that funny. We're the Millers is good for casual watching. Come to think of it there are no comedies that you can actually take serious. This one especially is no way near any kind of seriousness. However it does a decent job and entertainment.This one is directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber. I'm not sure if that name rings a bell or I have seeing any of his previous works that was good enough to remember. But We are the Millers is showing good potential for better things to come by Rawson. And the part 2 is already rumored and I hope he will do a fine job with that one too.I liked the character of David performed by Jason Sudeikis. He has previously done some fine funny roles in Horrible Bosses (2011) and Hall Pass (2011). In this also his main role keeps up the spirits. And then comes Jennifer Aniston, one of the most underrated yet skilled actresses of the commercial cinema these days. It's mind blowing how good she looks in this.

It's excruciating as a drawn-out gag.Then we're treated to a painfully drawn-out border crossing where Aniston is carrying enough dope on her lap to alert German Shepherds who served in Berlin after World War II. The gag ends when a bunch of Mexican illegals drop out of the bottom of the Winnebago and make a run for it. And the border patrol starts shooting at them!

Millers Crossing,"My wife and I were quite pleasantly surprised by this broad, road-trip comedy starring Jennifer Aniston. Sure the humour was occasionally a bit broad for my taste, like the swollen genital scene, the mom and sister-kissing scene plus Jen is required to wet-strip tease down to her skivvies at one point too. While all this probably took it too far into ""There's Something About Mary"" territory, at other times the humour was quite ribald and certainly caused some outbreaks of laughter in our living-room.Jason Sudeikis is papa Morgan, coerced by the least threatening geeky drug overlord you'll ever meet into corraliing a makeshift family out of his assorted oddball neighbours to act as cover for the smuggling of a mere smidge, okay, smidge and a half of marijuana over the Mexican border. So is born the Miller family, comprising stripper Aniston as his wife, Emma Roberts as their street-punk daughter and Will Poulter as their virginal teenage son. They all worked well together, evoking a ""Married With Children"" vibe, although they can't stop Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn from stealing their scenes as the dysfunctional and shall we say nocturnally malfunctioning oddball couple they meet out on the road.The film runs out of steam a little for its second half with a marked increase in vulgarity and slapstick and the gradual coming into view of a near-as-dammit happy ending but there are certainly some entertaining quick-fire exchanges and comic set-ups earlier in the film, especially when the family has to find a way to pay off a corrupt but distinctly amorous gay cop just after they pick up their filled-to-the-gills trailer containing the weed. It was no surprise however that I didn't get much from the pumping tracks chosen for the soundtrack where I figure I'm about forty years out of that particular demographic although I did recognise the ""Almost Famous"" nod with the family singalong to ""Waterfalls"" by TLC.Still, for the most part, ""We're The Millers"", while not the kind of movie we'd normally watch, turned out to be quite funny and entertaining and in addition, is worth watching right to the end of the closing blooper-reel when the lead cast humorously pay tribute to Jennifer's most famous part.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Drug-dealer needs family for drug-run in this crude comedy.,"A local drug-dealer does a good turn and is then forced to do a drug-run.The drug-dealer is an ex-college drug-dealer who has never grown up. Whilst others have settled down with families or become big business-men, this guy is still dealing. Just like John Goodman in 'Flight', this guy goes around dispensing happiness. This drug-dealer though, is not as flamboyant as Goodman, he dresses down, he is anonymously scruffy so that he fits into his environment.He is a busy, content, friendly, happy-go-lucky, single guy. However his life is turned upside down by a single event and he faces the daunting prospect of 'going down ol' Mexico way' to pick up a drug consignment and smuggle it back into the USA.Realizing he requires a disguise, the drug-dealer has a 'eureka' moment, and decides that he needs a family. So it is then that this is how the Miller family came into existence. This was the plan, but when he tried to get the family together, there was some reluctance. Mr Miller, a regular all-American working-stiff, is of course in reality this drug-dealer. Mrs Miller is really a hard-up stripper, Master Miller is an abandoned kid, and Miss Miller is a homeless kid. However, together, they are 'The Millers'.In the recent '2 Guns' the plan was to go to Mexico to get drugs, but that did not happen, and instead the film veered off in another direction. However, in 'We're the Millers', this is where the drug-smuggling plot starts and continues. In 'WTM', the drug consignment is picked up, however things do not proceed as planned.A brief appearance by Luis Guzman is just one of many problems faced by the Millers. If you enjoyed the gross sex-scene in 'Identity Thief', then you are going are going to love this film, as sex rears it's ugly head, again, and again, and again. NB. In the UK this is rated at 15.'IT' is an inferior film to 'WTM', as it relied on a nasty woman destroying a nice guy as the subject matter for generating humour. 'WTM' is also superior to both '2 Guns' and 'The Heat' because it is just a comedy. As such therefore the mood is never dampened by the intrusion of realism. This is not an action-comedy but a comedy played strictly for laughs. This does not mean there is an absence of bad guys however; there are bad guys!, and they act bad!, and look bad! Some have questioned the ability of Jennifer Aniston to play a stripper. However, this film is not about the ability of Miss Aniston to dance like a stripper, but rather it is about her playing the character of a stripper, who is in turn playing the role of an all-American mom. This is the central part, and joy of this film, all of the Millers are in fact playing two roles, and it is in the contrast between the two roles, in which much of the comedy lies.The Millers are a perfect family and all members of the family play their twin-roles perfectly. The supporting cast members too, are, without any exceptions, great. Suspension of belief is almost total. As a scene develops the Millers seem doomed to be exposed, or even just doomed. Now the audience doubts ""but surely ..."", but as the tension builds to a conclusion, total suspension of belief is restored, as the Millers escape, or explain, and the plot veers off into another direction.Taste is a subjective matter, however this reviewer, before going to the cinema, had heard other reviews, which stated that this comedy is not funny. Wrong! Do not listen to those bad-mouthing this film. After the first few minutes, this reviewer howled with laughter right through the film, as did the rest of a packed audience.So!, climb aboard with the Millers, and share their journey! This comedy road movie is much funnier than 'IT', 'TH' or '2G'. Meet, and get to know, the family. Find out the back-story to the greeting ""We're the Millers""! This crude, funny, gross, comedy is a must see! A perfect film from start to finish. At the end there are also a few out-takes too. 10/10.Warning: This film is very funny but viewers are advised not to try to replicate the scenes from this film, either at home, or abroad.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

the most fun you'll have at a comedy this year.,We're the Millers takes the longest road into disbelief and comes out the other side with pure gold. IF you are a person who needs to analyze a movie to death and are anal about plot points. don't see this movie. However if your goal is to enjoy yourself and watch a funny movie then this is the one for you. For me this one ranks up there with the original Wayans Scary Movie as the funniest movie I have seen. the basic plot is this. David is a drug dealer he deals pot and he's good at it. But he isn't a great person to have as a friend. He is selfish and is just in it for him. When a neighbour's kid Kenny get's involved in a fight trying to save a girl named Casey.
