"Twilight! Twilight! Oh, my... Twiiiiiiiiliaaaaaaaaaaght!","That was my interpretation of this weekend that I had to endure working at my movie theater, all these little hormone crazed brace wearing under developed young girls who I think would've just about died with the anticipation of seeing Twilight, I'm not kidding, I personally witnessed a twelve year old say that she wanted to have Robert Pattinson's baby. OK, so how I saw the movie, my sister, ironically my older sister has been just raving about the Twilight series with her friends and told me that I have to read these books, after weeks of bugging me with it, I finally broke down and read them. Actually it's kind of a fun series, it reminded me of the same love that I had for the TV series Buffy the vampire Slayer when I was a young teen. But of course she has to take me to the midnight premiere with 100,000 crazed fans who were knocking each other down and crawling all over each other just to see a movie.Bella Swan has always been a little bit different, never caring about fitting in with the trendy girls at her Phoenix high school. When her mother remarries and sends Bella to live with her father in the rainy little town of Forks, Washington, she doesn't expect much of anything to change. Then she meets the mysterious and beautiful Edward Cullen. Intelligent and witty, he sees straight into her soul. Soon, Bella and Edward are swept up in a passionate and decidedly unorthodox romance. Edward can run faster than a mountain lion, he can stop a moving car with his bare hands - and he hasn't aged since 1918. Like all vampires, he's immortal. But he doesn't have fangs, and he doesn't drink human blood.So, my opinion about Twilight the movie... honestly, it's average, it's my junior high romance with a vampire. I hate, beyond hate to say this, I'm a hypocrite for saying this, but because I read the book before I saw the movie, I had this completely different interpretation of what the characters look like and how they say certain lines. Twilight the movie made me laugh more than anything simply because of the actors, Robert and Kristen are not bad actors, but the way they talked, I just couldn't take their ""love"" seriously. Peter Facinelli who played Carlisle Cullen, Edward's father, was exactly how I pictured and pulled in the best performance of the film. Is it worth the watch, absolutely if you're a fan of the books, otherwise, I would say if you just wanna see this movie, I recommend the matin√©e price because honestly, I think I may have lost my hearing after this weekend of the none stop screams from crazed teens.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
So bad it's ALMOST good.,"NOTE: This review is the fair and unbiased opinion of someone with extremely little knowledge of the Twilight series. I watched the movie with a few die hard fans who I talked to after the movie, and I will work some of their thoughts into the review.Another much loved book series has been brought to life in the form of Twilight, which despite having nothing in common with the Harry Potter series, will undoubtedly draw comparisons because of the furor and craze surrounding it. The main difference between the two, however, is that the Harry Potter films are generally good and solid films. Twilight, despite having done a couple things right, is not.As a story, I will admit, Twilight is very catchy and interesting. Now I see what all the hype is about. If I was a young girl, I would go nuts over this stuff too. It's not just a vampire and a human falling in love with each other, but because of the two leads, it's one of the best on screen romances of the decade. This, however, is severely hurt by the fact that Twilight boasts easily some of the worst writing and editing I've ever seen. Let's not forget about the horrid VFX and pasty makeup, either. It's one of the cheesiest films of the year, and can definitely be put in the category of ""so bad it's ALMOST good"". Yes, I just invented that category.The 'allure' of the film appears to be the character played by Robert Pattinson, who ironically was previously known for his role in the Harry Potter series. Pattinson succeeded there and he more than succeeds again, as he more than fit the bill for what he needed to do with the character. Most actors would believe the only requirement of the character is to be good looking, but Pattinson takes it a step further and makes Edward Cullen very likable, trustworthy, and in the end, a good hero for the audience. Kristen Stewart is sort of the queen of not showing facial expressions, so she's perfect for the role of the awkward teen Bella Swann. However, there were sometimes where her lack of emotion bothered me.Our supporting players...Well, none of them are noteworthy like Pattinson is. The villain of the film is lame, cheesy, and played by an actor I can't take seriously. Nikki Reed is probably the best as Rosalie, Edward's 'sister', and the antagonistic vibe felt from her adds a different side to the movie.Okay, I don't really know what possessed the writer of this screenplay to make it so horrible (was it the source material?), because the dialog is just so bad that I laughed at serious moments. There's a lot of intentional humor, mostly in the beginning when Bella and Edward feel like awkward teens in love. I guess the movie moved along okay, because I wasn't bored at all. I was either laughing at how stupid the dialog was, laughing at some of the mildly funny jokes, or getting pulled in by the electric chemistry between Stewart and Pattinson.That, folks, is the reason most people will be able to sit through this movie. The chemistry between the two leads, romantically and sexually, is amazing. In this respect, Pattinson and Stewart are perfectly cast and it makes me wonder if they could end up together in real life some day. I was very surprised by how much I liked seeing their one on one scenes, as cheesy and bad as the VFX and editing are.As far as these visual effects go, I've seen a few vampire movies in my day. I'm going to assume director Catherine Hardwicke has seen a few. Well, she needs to watch a few more. Her fight scenes are horribly choreographed, terribly shot, and lack the intensity required to successfully rouse her audience. I could almost notice the wires the actors flew across on. I noticed a ton of errors with the editing as well, such as basic stuff like mouths moving and no words coming out, and words coming out when no mouths were moving. The fight scene at the end has wicked bad editing too, as the sound mixing also suffers as well.All in all, with Twilight, as bad a movie as it may be, I couldn't help but stay interested in it because of the electric chemistry between the leads. That alone kept me in the seat the whole time. It is technically one of the worst films of the year, but the entertainment factor in the above respect keeps it out of the company of movies like Disaster Movie and College. I was actually lucky to see it with some of the fans of the book, and all of them (5) described the movie as a 'disappointment' and that the film went 'half way' with some subplots, either starting and dropping them, or randomly starting them halfway through an individual subplot. They were not happy at all with this movie, but agreed on one thing: Robert Pattinson was the perfect Edward Cullen. I'll agree with them on all those points and say that Twilight is exactly what I thought it would be: so bad it's ALMOST good.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Twilight,I think this movie suffered from lack of a good script and bad acting.,,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Undeniably Atmospheric,"There's an atmosphere to Twilight and that much you simply cannot deny. I can't help but be engrossed by the way that this movie captures the beauty, dreariness and nature of the Pacific Northwest. A memorable score and soundtrack heighten Catherine Hardwicke's broody, yet still enchanting tone. Elliot Davis' cinematography under her direction replicates the indie flair prominent in her other features, this is what separates it apart from the commercially realised sequels that followed. It's a hot and cold, gothic romance with just enough high stakes to enchant you until the very end. If it's raining, you can best believe that I'm slipping into something comfortable and putting Twilight on.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
the book was better and thats not saying much,"Now do not be offended by any of this, this is just my opinion.No I am not a rabid Twilight hater. I read the books, yes all of them. I thought they were interesting. Not very original, well thought out, or well written, but decent enough to read. I had several problems with this movie. It's not just the cast. Though I think Cam Gigandet did an excellent job as James. Okay my main problem with the cast was not really who they picked. I guess it boils down to the fact that Bella and Edward really are not that interesting. Is it so much to ask for a heroine who isn't so whiney and can take care of herself. Or maybe a vampire who isn't broody and boring and doesn't SPRAKLE! ((sorry that just bugs the **** out of me)) I think if they had stuck more to the actually book it would have been better. Granted, not by much, but it would have at least gotten 5 stars from me.I do like the cinematography. The movie is gorgeous visually, and as i stated before the acting was not terrible. I would have picked different people for most of the cast, but thats me. I do have one more thing to say before i end this.RABID TWIlIGHT FANS NEED TO CALM DOWN!!! ITS JUST A BOOK AND MOVIE SERIES!! don't take the fact that people don't like it to heart. if you like it, thats great.",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Guilty pleasure,"If I saw the movie now for the first time I know I probably will hate it, but the 11 year old me was so love struck with it. Honestly no movie these days makes me this happy anymore. Also I think this one (the first movie) is so much cinematically pleasing. I enjoy the dark blue rainy vibe & the shaky camera a lot. This movie is my guilty pleasure. 10 for the nostalgia feelings.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
the SOUNDTRACK is amazing,"This movie deserves an 8 purely for the soundtrack - one of the best movie sound tracks EVER (in my opinion) and beautiful scenery and cinematography. sure, the acting isn't great, nor is the script writing, however this movie is an enjoyable watch and a romance classic",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Pretty Good for What They Had to Work With,"I have read the books, and the first thing I noticed was that the story wasn't about a plot line at all. It's about the characters and what's going on with them. Stephenie Meyer focuses on interaction, not on dialog, plot, or setting, which is fine. But it makes for a bad movie.Surprisingly, Twilight wasn't that bad of a film. I expected it to be much worse. As I said, there's very little plot or dialog in the book, so it's hard to make a convincing film. They had to over act looks to try and communicate without many words. I could probably count on one hand the lines in the movie.Other than the over acting, it wasn't bad. There were some very good moments and some very ""eh"" moments. But overall I would recommend it to Twilight fans. I probably won't ever want to see it again, but it's okay at midnight with some school friends who like it or something.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
I Just Saw Twilight,"Okay, I just got back from watching ""Twilight"" and I must say, cheesiest, choppiest, worst characterization of a movie I have seen in years and by far the worst Book adaptation I've ever seen! It even beat my discontentment with Ella Enchanted.As avid readers, we do not go to a movie to see ""surprises"" or script changes! We go to the movie to see our favorite books displayed out in front of us to see how our minds and visuals compare.Bella was suppose to be funny, she was way too bloody serious! Kristen go get some facial expressions, terror is not love and looking insensitive all the time is not what the character Bella is all about! She's so clumsy it's funny, she's sarcastic, you took out ALL of my favorite lines! And their should have been more chemistry between Jacob and Bella, it's like hey look their vamps, haha now you can leave. She's comical, did you even read the book?Edward, don't' look so constipated all the time. Like jeez you're suppose to be tense, not looking like you had too much carbohydrates and not enough water. Not only that you didn't' portray Edward's genuine gentleman side at all, the loving chivalrous side! And where is that infamous half smile! Honestly i'll make a list for all of your characters! An essay about each and everyone on how readers want them portrayed and what scenes we could do with out.Alice was awesome, Jasper, very nice! Rosalie, hell down pat! Emmet, please face baseball cap forward, it's annoying. actually don't wear hats, Emmet's not wangster and you look hot without it. Carlisle please cause some more fatherly emotion but good! Esme, you do alright.One question plagues me though... WHY WEREN""T THEY GIVEN MORE LINES? Like jeez! I understand your need to save time because no one wants to sit through a six hour movie but if it had to be three and a half hours, we'd enjoy it!Jacob Black, awesome casting!!!! But give him more lines, I saw Tyler Lautner in Sharkboy and Lavagirl, he's a really good actor, ACTUALLY why don't you JUST FOLLOW THE BOOK!! Come on everyone loved Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings. I read those books and especially in Harry Potter didn't' have any troubles with their movie adaptations, actually i didn't realized when they changed something! OK maybe some chapters were taken out but it didn't ruin the overall point and it was funny loving and mischievous. I loved those books and those movies.The chemistry between Bella and Edward was lacking.I actually didn't care to get up and go bathroom in between, i pretty much didn't' care to miss any of it. THIS IS A POPULAR BOOK! You're adaptation sucked major insignificant crap. I mean just look at your movie rating! For a book that beat Harry Potter's final book, I mean best seller's list and it was Eclipse the second last book of the series and it beat out the final book to HARRY POTTER. Couldn't you have taken a little more time on it. And where was Alice and Jasper and Rosalie and Emmet at the end in the prom scene?I honestly do not care if you continue on with the movies, actually I'd prefer it if you didn't. You have ruined my vision of it, you're killing your fan base. Unless you guys give the next one some extra spark and actually start listening to your fans, you can forget about a wide fan base. I absolutely hated the movie. I felt sorry for those who didn't read the books because they had NO CLUE what was going on it was so choppy!!! I couldn't even tell when the next day started, all of a sudden, Edward ""I would like you to meet my family"" next two minutes, ""wow you have a really nice house..."" um... hello did she sleep? DID I FALL ASLEEP? I think i missed something, oh no wait, you did. It's called nightfall. Where was the talk about twilight? How it is the beginning and ending of a day...? Or about her talking in her sleep. He looked like a weird serial killer stalking her in her sleep. WHERE WERE THE FUNNY PARTS! I had more fun and made my friends laugh by making my own commentary during the film, i even made people i didn't know who sat in front of me in the theater burst out laughing from my commentary then your boring movie did.As readers we expect the book to be taken seriously, and adapted to screen, NOT BASED, ADAPTED!!!!!! I've taken Communication Production Tech class in my high school writing my own scripts, so I know script writing agony, i'm also writing my own book. So if i was to ever sign off my book to make it a screen version I'd make darn sure it took more than a few SLOPPY months to make, with a CAST WHO READ THE BOOK FIRST AND RESEARCHED THEIR CHARACTER! Honestly, can you seriously give me an answer about how many cast members actually, i mean truly read all the books? I'm sure hardly any of them did.This by far is the biggest disappointment I have seen in years and I'm only eighteen.ADAPTION IS NOT THE SAME AS BASED ON!!! PEOPLE HONESTLY! Anyone who says they loved the movie did not care much for the characters or shares the same love as Stephenie Meyer does for her books. This was rushed, unorganized, ill plan, deceitful, and horrid.You're lacking the spunk, zest, fire, passion, integrity, and the complete ethics of what made the TWILIGHT SERIES!",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Twilight (2008): A Love Story That Sparkles and Divides,"Twilight, directed by Catherine Hardwicke and based on the best-selling novel by Stephenie Meyer, is a 2008 romantic fantasy film that has garnered both passionate fans and vocal critics. Starring Kristen Stewart as Bella Swan and Robert Pattinson as Edward Cullen, the film explores the intense and forbidden romance between a teenage girl and a vampire.Plot and Setting:
The story follows Bella Swan, a 17-year-old who moves to the small, rainy town of Forks, Washington, to live with her father. There, she becomes fascinated by the mysterious and alluring Edward Cullen, a student at her high school who turns out to be a vampire. As Bella and Edward fall deeply in love, they must navigate the dangers that come with their relationship, including the threat posed by other vampires.Performances:
Kristen Stewart's portrayal of Bella is characterized by her understated and often introspective performance, which some viewers found relatable and genuine, while others perceived it as lackluster. Robert Pattinson brings a brooding intensity to Edward Cullen, capturing the character's internal struggle and romantic allure. Their on-screen chemistry, while sometimes awkward, effectively conveys the magnetic pull between their characters.Direction and Cinematography:
Catherine Hardwicke's direction emphasizes the moody and atmospheric tone of the Pacific Northwest setting. The film's cinematography, with its muted color palette and frequent use of natural light, enhances the ethereal and otherworldly feel of the story. Notable scenes, such as the iconic meadow sequence and the thrilling baseball game, are visually striking and memorable.Soundtrack and Score:
The film's soundtrack, featuring artists like Muse, Paramore, and Linkin Park, plays a significant role in establishing its emotional and youthful vibe. Carter Burwell's score, particularly the haunting ""Bella's Lullaby,"" complements the film's romantic and dramatic moments, adding depth to the narrative.Themes and Reception:
Twilight explores themes of love, identity, and the struggle between desire and self-control. Its portrayal of a love that transcends the ordinary resonates with many viewers, particularly its target teenage audience. However, the film has also faced criticism for its portrayal of romance, with some arguing that it promotes an unhealthy dynamic and idealizes problematic behavior.Cultural Impact:
Despite its polarizing reception, Twilight has had a significant cultural impact. It sparked a global phenomenon, leading to a successful film franchise, merchandise, and a dedicated fanbase. The film also played a pivotal role in the careers of Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson, propelling them to international stardom.Conclusion:
Twilight is a film that elicits strong reactions, both positive and negative. Its blend of romance, fantasy, and teen drama struck a chord with a vast audience, making it a cultural touchstone of the late 2000s. While it may not be a cinematic masterpiece, its appeal lies in its ability to tap into the emotions and fantasies of its viewers. Whether you love it or loathe it, Twilight remains a significant entry in the landscape of young adult adaptations, leaving an indelible mark on pop culture.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
I watch this movie when I'm sad,"Perhaps I Have to tell something so that people who hate this film do understand why I review like this. My Dad died in 2008 when Twilight aired. I watched the movie again and again. And today, I still watch it again and again. I always have problems when I read a book and they made a movie of it. Because most of the time the movie just sucks. But not with the Twilight movies. They are like the books, and this without a big budget. So if you have a hard time and you need a simple but nice movie to watch to leave into another world. Please watch this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
I can appreciate what this wanted and tried to be.,"To say that 'Twilight' carries baggage is a dire understatement. The books' reputation precedes them, carrying questionable writing and strong themes of abusive relationships, and it's impossible to watch the movies in 2022 without being aware of much derided special effects, acting, and more. At the same time, one tries to approach movies with an open mind, and it's important to recognize in the first place that these titles were written for a ""young adult"" audience, and all the horrid awkwardness that immediately greets us with scenes of high school age characters is actually very fitting, for good or ill. And secondly - there are a lot of recognizable performers here that have more than proven their capabilities elsewhere, before or and or since; I think most viewers should be well-rounded enough to recognize that even the best actors, given poor material to work with, will look bad in a lackluster feature.I don't think 2008 film 'Twilight' is especially great. However, I'm frankly astonished to find myself thinking it's not nearly as bad as everyone has made it out to be in the past 14 years. Here's the thing: all the ham-handedness, the overt and kitschy flourishes, the bluntness - and above all the stilted and gawky writing, acting, and otherwise execution - doesn't feel accidental. It's bewildering as a movie-goer, absolutely, and hard to swallow, and to whatever extent the approach here was intentional, I don't think it was pulled off with all due success. Yet this is a movie about teens, for teens, with supernatural elements forced in, and at the same time that the picture comes across as unnatural and inorganic, nothing actually seems out of place. It's a flummoxing, indelicate balance, distinctly imperfect, and I can't for one moment begrudge anyone who honestly engages with 'Twilight' and dislikes it. For my part, though, speaking as someone who has watched films of all possible styles, genres, quality, value, from silent classics to Asylum mockbusters - I see what this wanted to be, and what it could have been. I can understand and appreciate the ways in which this does work, and those in which it doesn't. If the series were produced not as feature films but as a program on The CW alongside 'Riverdale' or the like, no one would bat an eye. I don't know if it's totally correct to say I like 'Twilight,' but... I get it.Hair and makeup, costume design, Elliot Davis' cinematography, Nancy Richardson's editing, the visual effects, Catherine Hardwicke's direction, filming locations, set design and decoration, the soundtrack - almost every possible aspect of the production design and art direction, more often than not, is painfully gauche, overdone, and a bit of a burden to bear. That's not to say that it's outright bad; sometimes a particular shot or scene is actually rather fetching, and were more care taken at large I can see where they would have fit in a title of greater repute. Artless as it may sometimes be, it's not sloppy.Of course, again, much has been made of the acting. To be frank: especially knowing what the cast are capable of, what I see in watching this are actors who worked with what they were given. At risk of repeating myself, the overwhelming awkwardness that pervades the picture from the very start is built into the characters and their interactions, the setting, the scenario, and every little detail, for better or for worse. In a story about young love, new friends, uncertainty, and personal and interpersonal conflict, all the somewhat halting, forced, or artificial expressions, movement, or delivery don't seem entirely wrong - but instead, kind of appropriate. Director Hardwicke has some noteworthy credits to her name, and if occasionally her contribution here is lacking, when it comes to guiding her cast, I think she was rather on point. Once more, it's a very fine line the production walks, an uneasy balancing act of ""just right"" that ever risks slipping into oafish gracelessness. Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson, Billy Burke, Nikki Reed, Anna Kendrick, and everyone else on hand did their best with what they had. None of the performances here are great - but by no means do I think they're altogether rotten.And that leaves the writing. Though I have certainly heard much about Stephanie Meyer's books, I freely admit I haven't read the source material, and I can only make assume that Melissa Rosenberg's screenplay is reasonably faithful. It's worth noting as well that Rosenberg has a considerable number of credits and indeed accolades to her name. The same facets I've described with 'Twilight' broadly certainly apply here, too, as the dialogue and characters vary between tawdrily brusque and direct, inelegantly clumsy and unrefined, and or what feels like is simply suitable. The scene writing, informed by Meyer's own, similarly has some bright spots, while at times struggles with contrivance. However, I also get a sense that this is just one of the difficulties of telling a YA-supernatural romance story; I find it hard to imagine there are many ways of showing scenes of Bella and Edward's blossoming love, or the demonstrations of his powers, that wouldn't come off as strained and cringe-worthy. And the overall narrative has problems in the small details, and above all treads murky territory with the questionably handled overtones of domestic violence and abuse. Yet the bare essence of the tale - a human mingling with ""creatures of the night"" - is classic, with familiar themes, and is no less worthy just because of the high school setting. In the wide strokes, I think the screenplay is just fine.What I think it all comes down to is that this is a movie that, beyond the presumed target audience of teen girls, is best left for those viewers who are wholly receptive to all the wonderful, weird, wild, or woeful possibilities that cinema has to offer. I genuinely believe that 2008's 'Twilight' is quite far from a bad movie - but I also readily recognize that I say this from a place of having done my best to find the value herein. Apart from the thematic material in regards to relationships, the biggest issue I see are the special effects - done well such as they are, but not considered at the storyboard stage with particular mindfulness. Everything else, from writing, acting, and directing, down to the slightest rounding elements, are ""okay"" or ""apt"" but constantly border on tactless or unsophisticated. For what it tried to do, and be, I think 'Twilight' was more of a success than not, but it tripped over its own two left feet a little bit too much for it not to be noticeable. Color me surprised, though - I can't say I wasn't entertained.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
TITSOAK4LIFE,"This is literally one of the best movies to ever exist. And I say one of, because the other best movies is the rest of the saga! There is no love like Bella and Edwards, expect for maybe Bella and Jacobs. This film goes beyond all expectations with it excellent blue filter settings, bag of hard boiled egg props, and a script that will keep my book of pick up lines full.I do wish they didn't leave out Bella's ankle length khaki skirt that she wore in the book to meet the Cullens.

much better than I expected,"As a gay 66 year old man, I am clearly not part of the intended audience for this film, however, I thoroughly enjoyed it.The film is filled with handsome teenage males, and many homely ugly- Betty goonily-dressed females, including the lead Bella. The boys either strut around looking pretty, with blank expressions, like runway models, or they act like silly hyper active grade 4 school boys. The boys are so inept in their attempts to impress the girls. Bella rudely dismisses them all with a look that says, ""You have got to be kidding. You thought I would have anything to do with you?""Bella is cranky, rude, not very bright, without interests, hobbies or talents. However, she is new to the school, which gives her some appeal.Edward, is considered the ultimate dreamboat by all the girls, but he allegedly considers himself too good for any of them. I thought the explanation was that he gay, but it turned it out was because he was a vampire.All the ugly girls get cute boyfriends in the end, but that fantasy- fulfilment story is very much in the background.To my great surprise the plot of the first half of the film unfolds with the ponderousness of a Jane Austen novel. I never expected that from a teen movie. There is great push pull between Edward and Bella. Edward is trying to control his urges to kill Bella and drink her blood. Bella blithely ignores what he is telling her. The reticence builds an incredible tension. It is similar to the sort of tension people in an earlier day felt trying to avoid sex before marriage or gay sex.What makes no sense is why Edward is attracted to Bella but not the other girls. I decided to pretend it had to do with scent or some vampire-only discernible attribute. The real reason has to do with fantasy fulfilment.Robert Pattinson does a brilliant job of portraying Edward the vampire. His approach is similar to Stephen Moyer playing the courtly vampire Bill Compton in True Blood. He is calm, patient, breathy, intense, old- fashioned. He is handsome, but in an almost non-human sort of way.At one point he says roughly, ""I am the most dangerous predator on the planet. Even my face, by voice and my scent are designed to lure victims."" You look at him, and imagine his exotic scent, he is speaking literal truth. It is like an electric shock. Photographs of him are not sufficient to show what I am talking about.Like the Superman I movie, Edward gradually reveals his powers to Bella. Unlike Lois Lane, Bella is completely unimpressed.The movie shifts gears to comedy, when Edward takes Bella home to meet the ""family"".Then the movie shifts gears again, stealing the special effects from Superman II, where the titans battle.Bella always chooses the most dangerous possible thing to do at each stage. It obviously helps the plot, but it made me want to smack her for being so stupid.Bella within almost minutes of meeting Edward decided she wants marry him. Then a week or so later she decides even marriage is not sufficient commitment. The want him to commit for eternity of life as a vampire. The belief that there was only one true love for me caused me untold misery. I might even go so far as to say it ruined my life. I hate seeing that poison being sold to unsuspecting young girls.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Vampiric romance lacks real 'bite',"After the enormous flurry of attention Stephanie Meyer's literary series attracted (a unique hybrid of Romeo and Juliet style teenage angst and hormonal lust and supernatural horror), a cinematic adaptation seemed not only inevitable but almost expected, providing sultry visuals to the tale of starstruck lovers and proving the definitive date movie for months to come. However, the curse of mainstream literary adaptations proves inescapable, with excitement surrounding the release leading to the film being somewhat unreasonably over-hyped. And while Twilight is hardly a complete failure of a film by any standards, there remains the inescapable sense of its existence being geared to match up to a set standard rather than simply aiming to succeed as a film, making for the overall result being uniformly disappointing, whether for fans of the source material or those unfamiliar with the novels.Few Hollywood productions have the concern of appealing to both the demographics flocking to romances and supernatural action films, and as such, the impression is frequently given of Twilight biting off more than it can chew. This indecision between concentrating on the supernatural or romantic facets of the film leads to one of the more glaring flaws of the picture - the sense of neither being devoted enough focus to truly excel. While the climactic battle is gruesomely effective, for the most part, the film's special effects appear rushed, under-budgeted and just plain sloppy, coasting by on horrendously unconvincing slow motion to represent vampire super-speed and making moments which should have been filled with wonder and awe instead evoke unintentional laughs and groans. However, Meyer's revisionist take on vampire lore is intriguing, and the viewer wishes the film had delved into the technical aspects of immortal vampire lifestyles further - a sequence where protagonist Bella slowly begins to suspect the true identity of the mysterious boy she has found herself involved with is impressively eerie and chilling. Such moments are aided incalculably by the tremendous musical score of Carter Burwell, whose bold mix of brassy Gothic themes and eerie, chilling motifs perfectly compliments the intensity of the film.However, Twilight's main concern lies in its script, which boasts some particularly gruesome patches of dialogue apart from the general lack of characterisation one has sadly grown to expect from the teen romance genre. Similarly, despite director Catherine Hardwicke appearing to be the perfect candidate to helm such a film (with directorial debut Thirteen demonstrating a keen knowledge of the teenage girl mentality), her handling of the source material is unfortunately shaky.The film repeatedly falls prey to the ""Harry Potter syndrome"", feeling somewhat clunky in its almost robotic adherence to its source material, giving it the sense of jumping awkwardly from plot point to plot point and lacking the necessary cohesion and narrative flow.But most importantly, for a film revolving around its central romantic attraction and sexual tension, the audience is never really given the chance to FEEL the romance, to be drawn in by the mutual lust and entrapment of the two leads for one another. In an oddly rushed sequence, the budding romance between protagonists Bella and Edward is reduced to a couple of nonchalant sessions of hanging out, mostly demonstrated through montage, after which Bella's (largely unnecessary) narration declares her unequivocal love for Edward. This rather abrupt transition would toe the line of appearing satirical of teenage romance were it not for the fact that the viewer realises the moment is meant to be completely heartfelt. What was likely far more effective in literary form, with the chance to understand Bella's emotions and mental process making the romance far more credible does not translate into film. As such, with this crucial central romance lacking the necessary spark which made the novel such a success, Twilight, for all of its periodic cinematic potential, just feels somewhat unnecessary.The film's casting is perfectly passable, supplying a sufficient variety of up and coming pristine teenage beauties capable of essaying their character types, yet for a book which was driven by such genuine intensity and passion, one can't help thinking of all the performances as somewhat listless and flat. While Kristen Stewart makes a passable romantic lead as headstrong Bella, she lacks the necessary charismatic spark to truly make the viewer warm to her, making her teenaged-angst interludes harder to empathise with. Robert Pattinson does his best as teenage dreamboat vampire Edward, sharing strong chemistry with Stewart, even if his ""sultry, moody glances"" delve into the melodramatic to the point of verging on comical at times. The rest of the cast give rather bland but serviceable performances, the standouts being Cam Gigandet who is mercifully given the chance to gleefully chomp on scenery and generate sufficient menace as sadistic villainous vampire James and Ashley Greene who essays the ideal balance of being sweetly charming without being overly chirpy as Edward's kind-hearted sister Alice. However, despite his best efforts, Billy Burke is forced to wade through ""stern but absent father"" clich√©s to the point of being almost invisible as Bella's emotionally stunted parental figure, and Taylor Lautner fares little better as mysterious prospective love interest Jacob.While Twilight is hardly a failure on all fronts, with a sporatic peppering of effective moments, the word which most ably describes the film as a whole is 'passable', lacking the necessary intensity or impact to truly hit home. It is easy to envision the adaptation being far more satisfying if done as a smaller, independent production outside the shadow of Hollywood, one which would not shy away from capturing the true passion and intensity of the central relationship without baulking at the prospect of a simmering yet sexless teenage relationship. As is, Hardwicke's film is content to succumb to clich√© and sloppy, complacent storytelling, making it far too 'bloodless' to truly satisfy.-4/10",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"No matter how hard I try, I cannot adapt to the movie - especially after reading the book... :(","Where should I start? With the story itself? With the actors? With the director? Anyway, I will definitely have some negative words from the people who like this movie but every one of us have different tastes, right? :) So I had seen the movie before I read the book so I had no (NO!) expectations. But come on how can you give the main role to someone who can just blink and shake her head all the time?!?! Then came the second disappointment. Robert. He did not act like he was suffering from the pain he was going through but really looked like he had to pee so hard... he should have been something like ""Adonis"" but do not go deeper into the look, I may have a quite twisted imagination of Adonis :))) When I read the book I realized that the actors are the smallest problem with the movie. Why oh why did they write over almost all the scenes??? The best parts had been simply cut out - they wanted to write drama or what? They should have kept the easy jokes and chatting in order to avoid choking the story into boredom...those could show the real side of Bella - a lovably woeful, inexperienced teenager girl instead of a depressive loser. The only thing I can give a 2 is because of the actors chosen for Alice and Charlie - I really appreciate them! Okok, Emmett is also fine :) All in all, if I could start it again, I would definitely not waste my time for the movie but reading the book over and over again (like I do it every day :)).

"A Great Film, Extremely Well Adapted!","I just got back from a midnight premiere, and the movie blew me away. I'm an avid book lover and college lit major and VERY hard to impress as far as book to screen adaptations go. I have NO complaints! (Take that mom and best friend!) Kristen and Rob are the perfect Edward and Bella. They were captivating from start to finish. I sat back in my seat and listened to my whole theater erupt in laughs, gasps, sighs and jumps at all the right places. Granted most of us in there were young women, but the movie just plain rocked that way. It sucks you in and tells the story just right. Even my friend who hadn't read the books was just as enthralled as the majority of us fan girls.The humor was Twilight's greatest asset. The baseball game was amazing and the mirror fight scene was tense. I enjoyed the music, the non-overdone visual effects, the adherence to all major plot points and characters and the ending. The ending was pretty much the best. I walked out really salivating to see the next 3 on screen, just like that.If you give Twilight a shot, you shouldn't be disappointed.

"Not excellent, but it is well-spent time","OK, so from what I know about this movie, people either love it or hate it. The truth, of course, is somewhere in-between. While the movie is not perfect, it is very good fun and delivers as long as you don't expect a masterpiece. So don't raise the bar of your expectations too high - this is NOT going to be an Oscar winning masterpiece and it is NOT going to enter the IMDb Top 250.The story is simple - Bella Swan is a common girl which falls in love with the vampire Edward Cullen. Cullen's family are ""vegetarians"" - they drink only animal blood and do not attack humans. Then, however, are the ""classic"" vampires that would not hesitate to do it, and Edward protects Bella from them.I guess those who hate the movie do not know what a bad movie really is. You can call a movie bad when you regret that you watched it and when you feel that you have lost two hours without any good reason. ""Twilight"" is not that kind of movie. It has a sense of direction and it is not just ""flowing around"" like other movies. Acting is pretty decent. Although I thought Kristen Stewart was an awful actress, Robert Pattinson (Ed Cullen) and Cam Gigandet (James, the villain vampire) excel in their roles. Although the story is not one of the most original ones, it does not bore people and if you have nothing to do, I would recommend seeing ""Twilight"".Oh, and by the way, for all the girls who adore ""Twilight"", I guess I get them. After all, Ed Cullen is good-looking, super-strong, super-fast, sensitive, who wouldn't like him?",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
the book was better!,"I read all the books in this saga and I found them fantastic. The plot is engaging and exciting, but when I saw the film it was a real disappointment.

There is absolutely nothing of the magic contained in the book and I am personally disappointed by this. Whilst I do not criticize the writer Stephenie Meyer, because her books are special and are the most beautiful I have ever read, it should have been better not to make the movie because it does not transmit the same emotions you get from reading the book .

"Not bad, but a lot of room for improvement","Before I begin, let me just say that I haven't read the book, so I'm not some die-hard Twilight fan or anything. In fact I hadn't even heard of either the book or the movie until a couple of months ago when my cousin (who had been reading the entire series) showed me her books and talked to me about it. She even said that there was a movie for the first book that was going to be released in a couple of months time. I remained uninterested, and I still lacked the enthusiasm to actually want to watch this movie in the first place, despite all of the frenzy over it, particularly with my female friends who, at the moment, have gone absolutely gaga over the male lead, Robert Pattinson (who plays the role of Edward).It was only two days ago, when a good friend of mine who I hadn't seen since June (because I moved to another school), asked me if I wanted to go to the cinema with him to watch Twilight. There really wasn't anything else on that could have been better, so I just thought ""what the heck, might as well give it a shot"". And so I did.This friend of mine is not really the kind of person to be watching movies like Twilight. Indeed, he is more of an action/superhero film type person, and so I don't think he liked the film that much (at the end I noticed an iPod earphone in his ear - need I say more?). Even now I'm still quite surprised that he even suggested watching Twilight in the first place.I, on the other hand, consider myself more open to different film types, and I enjoy a little bit of almost everything, Twilight being no exception.The choice of actors was simply a job well done; all of them fit into their roles perfectly. Pattinson, with his amazing, masculine good looks and pale skin, fits perfectly into role of the ""both-warm-and-cold"" vampire that is Edward Cullens. What I mean by ""both-warm-and-cold"" is that despite his cold looks and temperaments, he is an extremely likable character and his somewhat hopeless romanticism takes over slightly without tarnishing his vampire image. I honestly couldn't think of anyone else who could suit Edward's role better than Pattinson. Needless to say, he also makes really good eye candy.The choice of Kristen Stewart as Bella is also very noteworthy, as she also manages to fit her role as a pale, very reserved young woman really well. Bravo to her too.Just - bravo to both of them. Never have I seen such chemistry in a film. They are just such an item, and it's easy to see how much in love the two characters are thanks to these two wonderful actors.I felt that the film was filmed really well, too. I particularly love how every second of the film in Forks (the main setting of the movie) looks so cold and grim, and it kind of adds to the whole bleakness of it all.All of this, however, does not mean that Twilight doesn't have it's flaws. In the first half of the movie, despite it starting of well, it really seemed to have dragged on quite a bit and it wasn't until the second half that things started to get really engaging and interesting, and even exciting. Unfortunately I still don't quite understand one or two elements of the plot as much as I would have wanted to, so obviously that's a major flaw too.On a more minor note, the special effects could have been a little better, particularly with the whole ""speedy vampire"" business, which looked somewhat unrealistic, but despite it being unrealistic in the first place anyway, the special FX people could have made it seem more real than it actually did.Nevertheless, the above criticisms do not change the fact that it is definitely a watchable movie. It's not perfect, and it definitely could have been, but I guess at least it's kind of gotten me interested in reading the book, now. After watching that film, now I want to read the book so that I can finally understand those things that I didn't. In a way, my criticism of that may be considered a bit of an irony, but it is still no excuse to make the plot incomprehensible. Like I said, the film could have been much better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Gothic horror b movie classic,"Twilight is a comforting cult classic with mostly good actors in a very good adaptation of questionable source material. Hardwick brings her A game translating a cheesy book to the screen, and I belive intentionally makes it a b movie.

Count me as a Twilighter.....,"I can't remember the last time that I was literally one of 3 or 4 men in an otherwise packed theater. Tonight was just the case when my wife and I took in Twilight. My interest had been peaked by a co-worker who is female and a big Twilight fan. My wife has not read the books (nor I) but did receive the first 2 for Christmas. We wanted to check out the movie and see what all the hoopla was all about. We were not disappointed.I really enjoyed this movie. It does play like an episode straight out of any female focused romance story that is currently playing on TV. But there is a maturity about the film that brings it up a notch. It is full on love story stuff, but being a guy who isn't afraid to embrace the chick-flick side, I was pulled into the story, even though I know basically the outcome of the whole 4 book set. Catherine Hardwicke spun a very nice tale, it is shame she will not be back for New Moon. I thought all of the acting was top notch, Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson the obvious standouts. But it was the supporting characters; Edward's family, Bella's friends and family, that really helped with the enjoyment of the film.I had heard reports of laugh inducing dialog, never caught any of that. With any story that has a target audience that is in their teen years, one must expect earnest and often overly dramatic dialog and moments. It never goes into the day-time soap variety.There was a lot of online snipping from mucho-macho fanboys that mocked the film (without having read the books) and called in a Covenant clone. Too bad they won't let their geek cred take a hit and actually go see this film before bashing it. Not anything that will change cinema forever, but a very different and entertaining take on the vampire genre. The thing I enjoyed the most was the return of romance to the vampire tale. Recent films have taken a more action approach to the vampire tale. I can't wait for New Moon.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Didn't do the books justice..,"First of all I'd like to say that not many movies ever accomplish the difficult task of doing their books justice, but this movie basically made the books look ridiculously lame and cheesy. Anyone who watched the movie first hoping for some insight to the books will NOT want to read the books afterwards because the love story seems so unrealistic..while the reason the books are so popular is because they SEEM like the love between Edward and Bella could actually happen in real life! Until the baseball scene, there was really no action, and the movie just kind of dragged along. Once the ""bad"" vampires came into play, things finally started to get interesting. I think they should've included more action like this throughout the entire movie to keep viewers attention.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Sparkly vampires & one awful leading lady = a film that's tough to watch,"I'm about as far from this movie's demographic as you can get (I'm no 12-year-old girl), but in the interests of vampire cinema I forced myself to sit through this film in the hope of somehow enjoying it. Of course, I was bitterly resulted by what I saw, which is nothing more than an angsty teen romance that tries, and fails, to be a hip vampire movie. Vampire movies have long contained simmering sexuality ‚Äì Chris Lee positively exuded it in his Hammer outings ‚Äì but the theme is reduced to a superficial level in this film, as vampirism is just yet another problem ‚Äì like acne and the in-crowd ‚Äì that our young lovers have to deal with.The movie's po-faced efforts to tell this story seriously (I mean, you want me to take sparkling vampires seriously?) make it all the worse. The overly familiar plot never once attempts to bring anything new to the table, and the late-stage introduction of a supposed villainous character is a real fail. The film's nadir has to be the baseball set-piece, in which a family of vampires use their supernatural skills to beat the opposing team. Cinema doesn't get much more embarrassingly bad than this.Then again, if sullen teenage heroines with faces you want to slap (Kristen Stewart, I'm talking about you) are your thing, and your have a penchant for spiky-haired loners in white makeup, then by all means give it a go.

east coast Twilight screening,"Surprisingly good, of course it is sometimes a bit sugary, but that's to be expected in a teenage love story. Catherine Hardwicke did a great job, I love her edge. The casting director did well in choosing actors not movie stars to flesh out the book. Robert Pattinson plays the 'Hero' with the right amount of self-loathing and swagger. Kristen Stewart is believable and has a wonderfully tough vulnerability. You can almost see the supporting cast holding back a smile or grin, which made it even better. The Pacific Northwest looks gorgeous. It is a very important character in the film. Twilight made me want to take a trip to Oregon and Washington. A walk along the Cannon Beach coastline or canoe down the Salmon River would be lovely. And it would be worth every penny to hire a guide to hike to the stunning Multnomah Falls.

not for my age group,"Twilight was made for viewers that do not look at film critically, or even look at film for well constructed thought.

Maybe that is the key, this movie is for people who purely like to be entertained and not think about the 'why's' and the 'how's'. This is kind of sad because I really like movies that stretch outside of reality, but Twilight was more ridiculous than reality bending.If this movie came out in the 80's it most definitely would have lend itself to having a cartoon made after it.

Stands on it's own as a love story between a girl and a vampire,"About a year ago I was already reading and hearing about a new film, something called Twilight, which was going to hit in the fall of 2008. Well, the buzz is bigger than ever and the film finally opens this Friday. Gathering from earlier preview screenings, this film is going to be big. Based on the very popular books by Stephanie Meyer (there are 17 million books in print), Twilight is a unique vampire movie about a girl, Bella (Kristen Stewart) who moves in with her estranged father (Billy Burke) in Forks, Washington. Having always been different, she meets an even more mysterious guy, Edward (Robert Pattinson), who at first is disgusted by her (she's human, he is not) but then takes a liking to her. He's unlike any boy she's ever met and finds that Romeo and Juliet connection. Edward's family is unique; they're all vampires but don't feed on human blood, as a matter of fact, they don't eat at all. They live comfortably in a ""green house"" somewhere in the forest. His dad (Peter Facinelli, Jenny Garth's husband) is a doctor at the local hospital and they have gobs of cash (the books reveal how well off they are, but in the film, there's no explanation). A clan of new vampires are passing through and they threaten the little Pacific Northwest town feeding on the small population, but one in the group James (Cam Gigandet), is out to get the young Bella.This modern day love story is the strangest vampire movie I've ever seen. It's sort of a cross between The Lost Boys and Gossip Girl, which if you think about it, is a pretty enticing combination. I have to admit, having not read any of the books in this four-part series, I didn't know what I was in for. I knew it was about vampire teens in some Washington coastal town and that's about it, but I was intrigued from the start. The young cast look like your every day teen, and the vampire cast are as pale as Casper the Ghost. Some move swiftly, some sprint up trees and some can see into the future, fast-drawing her visuals on paper. It's all quite impressive. The story primarily belongs to Bella and Edward. The teen vampire hasn't aged in 90 years and finally finds someone who isn't afraid of him. Unfortunately for him, she's mortal. She's definitely not afraid of his blood-thirsty needs and he fights off the temptation of human blood. I'd say he's sort of like an addict that keeps fighting his urges. See... I told you, it's unlike any other vampire movie I've seen. Twilight is certainly no Interview With A Vampire (my favorite vampire movie) or Bram Stoker's Dracula (my other favorite) but it certainly stands on it's own as a love story between a girl and a vampire; it's passionate, exciting, intense and the Northwest locations are beautiful, you just want to drive there for a weekend get-away.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Don't get me wrong, all of those features were present in large amounts. I occasionally saw people in my age group watching this. There was a simple dividing line in the audience. Women loved it.

A lamentable movie - not recommended viewing.,"This film was awful. A non event and I would not recommend watching it. It was little more than a disjointed effort leading nowhere with the acting so poor I had to laugh. The scenes between the protagonists were awkward, unconvincing and lamentable. No one character was fully developed. There was much that was alluded to but never fully explored. How much was the budget? The problem here was directorial not financial. Some movies need polishing up; this one needs polishing off! I watched hoping it would get better - like some poor B movie. What I was left with was mild irritation, like a hangover after drinking bad wine. I can't believe I sat through this. I was so irritated at one point by the acting I almost walked out. I'm sorry this review is scathing but there was little to praise. I had little by way of expectation. I read fleetingly, in the tabloids, that it was a vampire movie. Okay, so it was a film aimed at the teenage market - but honestly, are teenagers, these days, so unsophisticated and banal? I suspect many will vote with their feet. I've heard nothing but praise for the book. I haven't read it. Was it meant to be a romantic movie? If that was the case then it was lost on me. The theme floundered like a damp squid. This was really a wasted opportunity. Give me a Hammer Horror movie any day. Movies starring the likes of Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee are in a different league. Low budget but with kudos. These actors knew their trade and were proud of it. Not sure which genre I would place ""Twilight"" in, but perhaps the bin would be more appropriate. I remember vividly watching a stellar performance from a stunning Michelle Pfeiffer and the inimitable Jack Nicholson jousting with the irrepressible James Spader in the 1994 movie, ""Wolf"". Now that film was truly a joy to watch. I was moved to tears. The story and suspense had your gripped from the start. It was a roller coaster ride with superlative performances. The film evoked emotion. Memorable? Definitely! I predict that ""Twilight"" (2008), will fade with day break and be a distant memory.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

I went in prepared and fully aware that it wasn't going to be like the book and that they were going to change it so it was more adaptable to the film. I didn't really have any high expectations, I just wanted to see some parts of to life or at least attempt to come to life. I was utterly ""mouth dropping"" disappointed. I don't know how Stephenie Meyer could have let this even happen to her precious story. There was no character construction, you didn't connect with the characters and this has nothing to do with casting for the actors. I don't even blame it on the director. THERE WAS NOOOOOOOOOOOO SUBSTANCE AT ALL!!! You didn't feel any connection with the love story. Events meshed in and clashed due to wrong timing and placement of scenes. Crucial scenes were left out for useless scenes ( field trip?!?!?!?!) Even though the scenery was breathtaking they could have cut out at least 40 minutes of it to develop the storyline better. They killed the story. It was horrible just plain horrible. This was worse than adaptation of Harry Potter. I was disappointed when i first saw Harry Potter, even though i accepted that it would not be the same and still enjoyed the movie. This is on a whole new story. At least Harry Potter made you feel like it was the essence of the story still there just cut short. Twilight was just like seeing two strangers that have no real established connection no relationship (They don't even have a friendship) and then suddenly they are together and now they are trying to save this girl who doesn't even seem like is in that much danger to the very end. I laughed in some parts but then there were parts where it was not meant to be funny and they tried too hard to turn the situation into a comical moment.Also the fact that inconsiderate fangirls were cheering for every useless pathetic scene in that movie didn't help to get into it. How can you call yourself a fan of the series if the essence of it was never even portrayed. Even if it wasn't close to the movie at least show some bonding of characters. I don't know how anyone who claims to be a fan of the book can enjoy this movie without cringing at the fact that they ruined the most basic story. Again, I am not talking about the actors' performance nor the directing. I'm talking about the beautiful aching and pain of the story. The soul of the story was never there.Will not go to another premier of any further movies. Will consider going to other movies but only to go see some the ""story parts"" being visualized. If you disagree, that is completely fine! To each their own! All i know is i love the book and will always love it but this movie killed me tonight!",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Predictable and Generic,"Having not read the book and going to the theater open-minded and with a few friends who had read the book, I figured I was in for a good night. Unfortunately, all I got were a few yawns and popcorn stuck to my shoes.I couldn't tell what was worse, the lack of gripping scenes that didn't seem like a rewrite of Romeo and Juliet for vampires, the annoying cheesy elements that caused forehead-smacking head-shaking disbelief, or the incredible predictability that the storyline took (how many variants of the male vampire falling in love with awkward teen girl can you truly make without getting predictable anyway??). I will give credit where it is due though for the fight scene at the end though that could have renewed the plot's vigor for me.... if it wasn't at the end of it, that is, and added even more weight to the predictable column.Overall, for someone not initiated into this by the book, I'm looking for my time back. I still hold out faith that the old truth still stands firm and ""the book was better"", because if the movie and the book resemble each other as closely as I'm told, I'll be more bored than I was in the theaters.My recommendation: if you've read the book, go see it and I'm hoping its better that way, but if you haven't read the book, stay away and find a better use of a night out.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
DOES NOT DESERVE THE HATE,"Listen. I KNOW it's hip to hate twilight. But come on. If you want some good ol' low effort fanfiction romance, this movie series is AMAZING. and you know what? This movie is actually not bad! The romance is pretty good, the music is awesome, the setting and the color and aesthetic are all really nice, and Charlie is a sweetie.I would love to say that I ironically like this movie, but the irony comes from the fact that I genuinely enjoy it.

The Best Movie Ever,"I have watched this movie upwards of 75 times in my life and I don't plan on stopping any time soon. This movie carries memories of friendship, sleepovers, and midnight viewings in home made t-shirts. There is merit to a story when it captures so many people's hearts- and I see Twilight as that story. The books that inspired this film brought the love of reading into the lives of many young girls and the movies only furthered the excitement. Edward and Bellas romance may be flawed, but the thorough enjoyment I get watching this movie has never worn off even all these years later. If you are a lover of vampires and have never seen this movie I reccomend it. And to those who have seen it and love it, may we continue blissfully into this small but perfect piece of our forever <3.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
My favorite trash nostalgic movie,God I love this movie.. it's one of those it's so bad it's good but it also holds a special place in my heart.

Cult Classic,"There is plenty to mock in this movie but also so much to love. The cinematography and soundtrack create the perfect mood to rekindle all the teen angst you thought you'd outgrown. It's okay to go back to that well now and again. Draw up the bucket and take a sip! Go with the story and have fun. You can laugh at the poor acting and script, and nonetheless be entertained by the plot and the romance and those lines that beg to be said aloud later and out of context. As for problematic themes, they are there and inherited from the source material (e.g. Unhealthy romantic relationship dynamics and whitewashing/shallow engagement with indigenous cultures, to name just a couple). There are also positive and empowering elements, namely the centering of the female gaze and privileging of a girl's experience (and the diverse, evolving fandom that bloomed from this franchise). Folks will still be discovering and loving this film decades from now, I'm sure.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"Not terrible, but terribly hilarious","I admit, I am not a fan of Twilight. I tried the books, thought they were boring, and forgot about them. I don't hate it, but I can't say I'm a fan. Somehow, though, I ended up going to the midnight showing with a group of friends, all of whom were fanatical Twihards.This movie was extremely entertaining to me, but for all the wrong reasons. I found myself laughing at the cheesy, often poorly-delivered lines, Rob's stony, creepy expression, which he retained throughout pretty much every scene, and the headache inducing, cheap special effects. I wasn't the only one; there was plenty of nervous, sometimes incredulous laughter from almost everyone there once the screams died down. In several scenes, it seemed almost as if the director was parodying the book, rather than trying to make a serious movie.Now don't get me wrong, this movie was not terrible. I liked the setting, it was pretty beautiful, and Bella's father's acting seemed quite believable. The plot also sped along a bit faster than the book did, making it less boring to me. However, Bella's actor seemed wooden, and Robert Pattinson seemed awkward and uncomfortable at times. Sure, he's pretty to look at, but he didn't convey emotions very well and dropped lines in a disinterested, bland way. After a while the movie began to get extremely dull and repetitive to the point where I felt like tearing my hair out.I liked how they fleshed out some of the lesser-known characters and gave them more personalities, and I loved Jacob's actor. The lack of climax was disappointing, and I found myself getting very annoyed with Bella quickly.Even so, most Twilight fans will probably enjoy it, but people new to the story (especially adults) will probably be confused (my mom was) and left with an empty feeling. I didn't feel as though I was being tortured by watching it, but besides all the unintentionally comedic parts it didn't entertain me that much.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Only Tolerable as a Watch Party,"I never in the world would have sat still for this cinematic tragedy unless I had been bribed with a group viewing that featured pumpkin carving and cake. It was fun to make constant commentary as an ostensibly 100 year old vampire seduces a high school girl. The lack of subtlety in the writing borders on the insane due to the fact that Edward is inwardly an old man stalking 17 year old Bella, casually breaking into her room, and endangering her life by introducing her to his ""friends"" and family. Highlights include permissive parenting that has devolved into child neglect as both mother and father of a teenager never once question how her strange, new boyfriend ended up along with her in the hospital suffering a badly broken leg and massive blood loss.

Teenage Vampire Romance At Its Dullest,"I've been avoiding 'Twilight' for years and was only open to watching it if it was on a had-to basis. And so, as that basis has presented itself, I watched it. After the immense popularity of the novels, particularly among the young crowd, a Hollywood movie seems to be the next step in further cashing in on the popularity these days. Famous examples include the Harry Potter films and 'The Da Vinci Code'.Cheesy and corny as it is, there are some unintentionally funny moments. The writing, directing, visuals and acting are quite poor. The special effects are sometimes so bad that it looks like a B-Movie.Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart became one of the most liked on- screen couple. 'Twilight' further made Stewart's lack of expression popular which may have overshadowed some of her good work (yes she can act at least sometimes as proved in 'Welcome to the Rileys' and even 'In The Land Of Women'). Pattinson does a passable job here. Most of the rest of the actors just follow formula. Special mention ought to be given to the lousy fight sequences.Overall, it's quite a silly film even dreadful at times but mostly (inadvertently) funny.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
I loved it,"Yeah, i know the ratings but honestly I was in dark all these years just seeing the ratings and reviews but today I watched it and truly i loved it i loved the characters, i loved the concept .

A delight for the right audience,"I originally watched this and read the books when I was like 12/13 years old. I'm revisiting now at age 25. I thought I would not be into it still, but I was wrong. This series is just so entertaining to me. I think the movie missed a lot of nuance that was present in the book, as movies often do (them getting to know each other, tension, info about the characters that is important to who they are, etc). I also felt that Edward & Bella are much more likable characters in the book. Bella is a genuinely good person, but I think in the movie she comes across mediocre. Edward feels like less of a creep in the books too. Lol. Regardless, I find this movie hilarious and fun.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
unconventional and entrancing,"This movie, despite its polarizing reception, undeniably crafted a deeply atmospheric experience. For all the criticisms thrown its way, *Twilight* has an allure that, even years later, still resonates, especially when you examine the elements that truly make it stand out: the cinematography, the soundtrack, and the magnetic performances of its leads.First, the cinematography by Elliot Davis. He managed to turn the rainy, misty town of Forks, Washington, into a character of its own. The film is drenched in blue and grey tones, casting a moody, almost ethereal veil over the world of humans and vampires alike. It's a choice that subtly enhances the supernatural elements without needing to rely on flashy effects. The forest scenes, where towering evergreens are shrouded in fog, feel both vast and intimate, almost as if the forest is keeping secrets. And that iconic ""meadow scene,"" with sunlight dappling through leaves, evokes a surreal beauty-it's the stuff of fantasy, yet grounded enough to keep the romance believable.The soundtrack, too, is an undeniable triumph. With artists like Muse and Linkin Park setting the tone, and Carter Burwell's delicate, haunting score weaving in and out, the music captures the story's intensity and the raw magnetism between Bella and Edward. ""Bella's Lullaby,"" composed by Burwell, is a soft, yearning melody that perfectly underscores the sense of dangerous romance. And let's be real-Muse's ""Supermassive Black Hole"" playing during the infamous baseball scene? It's unforgettable, capturing the adrenaline and strangeness of vampires trying to blend in. The soundtrack elevates the story, not just as background noise but as an essential emotional force.And then, of course, the performances. Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson gave us a fresh kind of chemistry. Stewart's Bella Swan is reserved, awkward, but refreshingly real-a far cry from the typical leading lady of fantasy romances. She brings an earnestness to Bella, grounding her emotions in a way that makes the unbelievable feel palpable. Pattinson, as Edward Cullen, brings a blend of brooding allure and vulnerability, capturing the pain of a vampire eternally suspended between life and death. He plays Edward with a haunted intensity, as if every word is both a confession and a warning. Together, they make the romance feel electric yet restrained, an intimate dance of attraction held in check by Edward's fear of his own predatory nature.In the end, *Twilight* is a film that holds nothing back in its commitment to mood, music, and a romance that, while unconventional, is as entrancing as it is uneasy. It's unapologetically itself, embracing its own brand of fantasy. And love it or hate it, you can't deny it achieved something rare: it became an iconic piece of pop culture, casting a spell that viewers have yet to shake off.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Really....REALLY...Not good...,"I've seen worse films, granted. But I could probably count them all on my hands. This really isn't the smartest of premises in the first place, although the book made it work very well. This film is slow, plodding, lacking in action (save for around 10 minutes about an hour and a half in) and, in my honest opinion, very over-rated as well. The trailer for this film looked fantastic but the film managed to disappoint me. I think what they have done here is the same with ""The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring"", focusing more on the build-up of the upcoming sequels rather than having an integrated story all of its own. The majority of this film was padding and was not needed at all. In fact, if you took out the moments that weren't necessary, you would probably end up with only about 20 minutes of footage. This film was a good idea that they shirked on and it could have been made into something a lot better. Unfortunately, a disappointing experience for both me and my friends.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Horrible. Just plain and completely horrible.,"""Twilight"" has to be one of the worst films that I have ever seen in my life! It has some of the worst acting that has ever been captured on film, not a single one of these characters are likable in anyway, the antagonists were lame, same as the protagonists, the movie seemed to never end, it was just stupid. I've been a vampire enthusiast for a long time, I love vampire productions(Nosferatu, Interview with a vampire, Lost Boys, and above all, Buffy the vampire Slayer(the best show ever). So it is not that I dislike the vampire genre, it's just that this is extremely stupid. I really don't see how anyone could like this movie, or it's painful to watch sequels. I hope this review was helpful and convinced you not to waste 2 hours of your life that you will never get back. Thanks.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
The ratings on this are heavily biased and memes,"Don't let the ratings fool you, I'm not a fan of the twilight series but its an okay decent film to watch on a date night. It's like a 6-7/10 typa movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Lacking Any Substance and Depth.,"Before I begin, I am a dedicated fan of the Twilight saga and have read all the books multiple times. I had very low expectations for this movie. I mean LOW. I had already begun complaining to anyone who would listen over the choice of Robert Pattinson as Edward. Turns out that the casting of Edward was among the least disappointing things about this movie. I wasn't even a huge fan of the dialog in the book, let alone in the movie. The relationship between Edward and Bella--prior to when Bella discovered what he was--was way too short. In the book, their relationship is deep and meaningful, in the movie, they take about 10 minutes of the total runtime to get to know each other properly. In some cases, the casting almost made me cry (Edward, Rosalie, Esme.) BUT in other instances, they did a great job. It took me a while to warm up to Kristen Stewart as Bella Swan, but by the time I got to the movie, I had begun to think she was a great Bella. Same thing goes with Ashley Green as Alice. At first, I hated the idea of Nikki Reed as Rosalie, but as the movie went on, I thought she suited the role well. Examples of perfect casting would be Taylor Lautner as Jacob Black, Jackson Rathbone as Jasper Hale and Peter Facinelli as Dr Carlisle. The baseball scene was probably the only scene in the movie that was true to the books description. By the end of the movie I was wondering what happened to the rest of it. I understand that they can't include everything, but they should've at least extended the meadow scene--It was a pivotal point in the book. It seemed to play out like a TV show with an introduction, conflict, climax, resolution within a small space of time. Overall, I enjoyed the movie, but it lacked the depth and substance that the book had. The main problem was they only touched on how strong Bella and Edward's connection is and how problematic this is for both Bella and the Cullens.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Oldie but a goldie,"This movie got me through my childhood; it may not be the best overall but it's the perfect movie to me. I wish I could experience seeing it for the first time all over again and the sheer hold it had over me in my middle school days. Even to this day, this whole saga means a lot to me and the first movie being my favorite.Word of advice, if you want to like this movie don't let anyone stop you just because it's 'Twilight' and 'its bad' because it's not actually THAT bad for it's time. Honestly wish we could dip our toes back into the saga and get a remakes that we deserve, but until then I'll continue to love the movie as is.üêÄ",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Unrealistic reviews,"I find it quite funny how the Twilight series is rated so low and don't believe probably 80 percent of the reviews. Although the movies are not as good as the books.

Movie with no substance or acting talent,"I was hanging out with my niece and she talked me into renting this movie. Wow! What a colossal waste of time. This movie has absolutely no substance and actors have even less acting talent. It really makes me wonder how this movie made so much money and why the actors keep getting decent acting jobs in other movies. Well, Bella is an absolutely dull lifeless character. It seems like the actress couldn't get emotions out of herself even to save her life. Edward is also mind-numbing, he can't express any love or even interest to Bella. There is no chemistry between the two of them. The movie is also filmed as though it's in slow motion. Stay away from Twilight",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
I have lost all hope in this generation.,"I am normally a person to read the book that a movie is based off of before actually seeing the movie. That being said, I had no intention of reading or seeing Twilight. My friend asked me to simply read the book, which she claimed was much better than the movie, and go from there. I took her up on her offer and began reading the first book in the Twilight saga. After six chapters and pulling much of my hair out, I gave the book back to my friend and told her how agonizing it had been to read even those six chapters. She asked me to see the movie, thinking that I may like it more than the book.Well, I did see the movie, and spent the entirety of it with my mouth gaping at the awful cinematics, the horrible acting, and the terrible plot.Now, I understand that the movie, being based on the book, had no real plot to begin with and, therefore, could not help the story itself. however, there is no excuse for the poor choice of actors, the overly dramatized portrayal of the infatuation of a teenage girl, and horrible scenes. Even if the director had no plot to work with, he could have at least tried to make the scenes look good, much less chosen qualified actors for the dramatic characters of the story.In my opinion, there is no excuse for this film to have been as bad as it truly is. I have no respect for the author of the book nor the director, actors, makeup artists, of special effects teams of Twilight.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Great movie to loose time in,"This is exactly what it's supposed to be, a teenage love drama. It has atmosphere, story and great music.Even years later I find it's still a great movie to pop on from one of the various streaming sights, easy watching and filmed well enough that it hasn't really aged too much considering the age of the movie now.The love story itself is also quite intoxicating and leaves you wishing that you had had that in your younger years.Now the music.....I find the music great in the full series of films and happily play the playlist on Spotify.The series of films does justice to the books and should be watched even if you don't like the romance side.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Even the target audience should deserve more,"I didn't expect a true adaptation of the book, but I thought the book read well enough to be an easy translation into a decent screenplay. It is disappointing that the director didn't see that this could have been the next Harry Potter quality of series and instead tried to string together several music videos. If you didn't care at all about the careful building of a very ordinary town that Stephanie Meyer so beautifully crafted, or the key features of the characters in the books, then you might like this movie. The acting was hit or miss, the swirling camera scenes were obnoxious, and anyone who read the book would be horrified to see the compassionate and gentle Carlisle played as a cocky slick haired and insignificant character. The actor who played Victoria fits the description of Esme instead of the wild looking Victoria, but the actors playing Alice, Rosalie, Angela, Mike, Bella, and Edward were more representative of the book. I hope they make more because I liked the story so much, I just hope they will take more care next time to develop the setting and characters next time, even if they feel the need to leave in the swirling music video clips.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

I mean... Really?... This is sad...,"Let's go ahead and cut to the chase. This movie sucks. It just sucks. And that's all there is to it. Did I read the books? No, and I certainly won't now. The idea sounded interesting, vampires and werewolves (not entirely original but hey whatever) fighting with a girl thrown in the mix who falls for the bloodsucking Edward Cullen. Doesn't SOUND bad, until you hear the dialogue and acting jobs of these guys. Bella (Kristen Stewart), has the personality of a bucket and Edward (Robert Pattenson) sparkles with a more flamboyant shine than Tinkerbell from Peter Pan. Putting aside that nonsense, we have ourselves a movie with pointless scenes that just kill time (ex. that poorly made baseball scene) and a plot that leads. Well, to nowhere, I guess to the sequel unfortunately. My biggest complaint with this movie is that none of the characters are likable. Edward just complains about being a vampire, Jacob hates him because Bella hangs out with him more, and Bella has the same facial expression for the whole film.

Terrible,"This film is despicable; totally disgusting. Its purpose is naught but appealing to young girls aged 10 to 14 in hopes of melting their hearts with bare-chested teenage boys. As for reviewing this film in a technical manner; of which it is hardly deserving; the acting is stale and soulless, the casting laughable (in that it caters to a specific group of the population; that is young females); and the direction terrible. The plot is obvious and bad and it betrays every legend that exists of vampires.Seeing this film being as successful as it has in the box-office truly does make on think what has happened to the world. How one can write such a simple peace of teenage-girl catering drivel; find a designer to direct it, muster a few million dollars and cast a few unknown young pretty people to star in it. The ""film""; a term it is hardly deserving of is as transparent as a republican promise and it makes for a roller coaster of disappointment and is truly difficult to bear even seeing once.On a separate note,the later installations of this franchise are the worst of cash cows in the world and elaborate on the traits the first ""film"" exhibits. That is to say; they are even worse.All in all; it's a disgrace to the business and an affront to the world of film.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"whoever you are, girl or boy, man or woman, Twilight is shoddy, pretentious film-making","Look, whoever-you-are-readers, I'm not a teenage girl. I'm a 20-something gent who just likes watching movies, usually good ones. I can also go for the occasional really stupid/fun bad movie or incredible guilty pleasure. With Twilight, I knew it was, according to what I heard and read and seen about it, *meant* for teenage girls, I suppose, since it's one of those super dated and tried-and-whatever stories of a girl falling for a guy she's not supposed to and bad stuff happens - only with vampires. I can't speak for anyone except myself in saying it simply stating that it's not a good movie. Period.And it's not just about the treatment of vampires. Sure, there's that. Sure there is the facet of these being diluted and watered down so-called vampires to the point of being nothing but mockable. But it's simply a story that on its own terms is not told well. It's shot through the filter of whiter-blue-shade-of-pale, where the intent, I guess, is to make Washington state (specifically the town of Fork) look like this all the time.The director, Catherine Hardwicke, has directed some decent films before, such as 2003's Thirteen. But here she tackles the material without any subtlety. The cast, featuring sometimes very-good-actors Kristen Stewart and (yes) Robert Pattinson, seem to be in the kind of ""method* subtlety that comes with that caveat of years of the James Dean in-breeding school of acting. Her camera people roam around without, usually, any sense of placement for the sake of the story, and, well, the story itself reeks of stupidity and consequence in the most mind-boggling of happenstances.Perhaps there could have been at least a semi-interesting or compelling story here, with an out-of-town girl in a new town meeting a young mysterious man at her high school and falling in love and finding he's a vampire and still being really turned on by it and yada yada bad things happen. Or maybe I'm wishing impossible things. Coming from a book by Stephenie Meyer that is more Harlequin romance than vampire lore, it's central problem is giving us characters not only not likable, but without personality. Say what you will about the corny aspects of Whedon's Buffy the Vampire Slayer, it had characters and story lines that actually meant things, with personalities and humor and real drama that could be affecting. In Twilight the coldness of the environment is reflected quadruple-fold in the characters and story, and the film-making, shoddy as it is, probably reflects that attitude of the book.Oh, and of course, it's corny poppycock a lot of the time, but again it shouldn't have been a problem. I might have even laughed out loud, for all the wrong reasons, at one of the most unintentionally funny scenes of the decade with the vampire baseball scene (yes, it's as ludicrous and bang-your-head-against-the-wall-till-you-bleed without any point for the story save for a West Side Story stand-off). But aside from its abstinence-only allegory (and believe you me, this is the antithesis of 2008's Teeth), there's nothing here a viewer can take away of worth. Nada. Zilch. There's nothing interesting in the romance because the characters are either boring miscreants, befuddled side characters like Bella's father, or 1/2 dimensional drones like that ""bad"" vampire in the mirrors climax.And finally, nothing to add significantly to vampire lore, save for its pop culture phenomena. Maybe I'm missing something the teen girls are seeing, maybe there's something oh-so dreamy about that pretentious navel gazer Edward. But a duck is a duck, and Twilight is an overwrought, meddling piece of a twaddle-corpse movie.",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Tween wish-fulfilment at is most tedious,"We all know exactly why this film was made, let's not even pretend this was ever going to be any kind of artistic endeavour. Twilight exists solely to pander to the young girls demographic with pretty sparkly vampires and a blank slate of a heroine you can easily project your personality onto. Complete and utter wish fulfilment. Does the film do this well though? No. No it doesn't.For one thing, as a person who never falls asleep during films, this was so tediously hard to watch I almost fell asleep during the ""action packed climax"" of the film. The acting is dull as a blank sheet of A4 paper, a myriad of pale, drowsy eyed teenagers not finishing sentences and mumbling their lines. The few good actors this film manages to boast are shoved to one side for more pasty, nauseating ""romance"" between our two leads, Pattinson and Stewart. On the topic of the romance, there is absolutely no chemistry between our leads yet the film wants us so badly to believe that this is some kind of breath taking romance. I didn't buy it for a second.Even for the trashy romance novel on film that it is, It just doesn't work. It's poorly acted and painful to sit through. Skip it.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Twilight review,"Its not great, its not the worst movie either, I liked the cinematography and some of the fight scenes, the acting was good enough, not into the romance or sparkling vampires much but overall not as bad as I thought it would be, so I had a acceptably good time and its one of the stronger movies",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
No masterpiece but reasonably good,Growing up I always refused to watch this like a lot of the guys of school age but gave it a chance during these times of quarantine and have to say I actually did enjoy it!

This movie was horrible.....,WTF?! It was so cheesy and corny and awkward. I felt like the actors/actresses didn't mesh well and the movie was just one big cluster F of one scene after another. When there were little jokes it was just awkward silence in the crowd and the entire relationship of Bella and Edward was very awkward. I didn't believe they were in love and the acting was really bad all around. The CGI was pretty bad as well. To make them look like they were going fast all they did was make them blurry. I felt like this movie was made with 90's technology. This movie had so much potential to be great but this movie ruined it. The only way they can save it now is a reboot with new actors/actresses and possibly new director.,1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Another Awful Adaptation,"Many times before, we have been disappointed with bad novel adaptations, and this is perhaps the worst case I know of. The plot is driven too fast and it's outline doesn't have any support at all. It's chronological sequence is very vague and senseless, also dialogues are too lazy. And if this was little, the acting doesn't help at all, the visual effects are not even interesting. Maybe just the music and the photography are worth but the dizzy editing spoils it at it's whole.

It's for heart-eyed teenagers(girls especially) who THINK that they KNOW what love is !,"First of all, I have read all the Twilight books thoroughly and i exactly know what the story is and what it's all about......

Kiddos, this isn't real love.....It's some boring author's shitty imagination and perception(wrong, by the way) what love should be.Recommended only for sex starved teenagers and die hard dumb twilight fans, rest....save your brains and get the hell out of the movie hall !!!!!!The storyline itself is nothing but below average.... The acting sucks literally, Edward aka Robert does nothing but screw his face as someone just kicked him between his legs and says; ""I love You, Bella !."" all the time.Bella has a fixed dumb founded look on her face for all the two hours....Rest all are not even worth mentioning.Oh man, people get a life !!!!!!!!!!!Its not real and it isn't even good imagination.....(hell its imagination at it's worst).Don't waste your time on this one, instead go have a quick nap (much much more productive than watching this crap).3/10Hell i'm giving 3 just because.......like you know.....a donation....It was painful to sit through his one....trust me you would like to watch some sing dance Indian movie instead !",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"I enjoyed it when I was a teenager, but not any more","This film is definitely aimed at teens. If you're not a teen, you probably will think it's lame and fingers-down-your-throat bad. I was 12 when I first watched this, and I loved it to bits, I would have given it 11/10 stars at that age! But now, I'd give it a lot less. But, to give an accurate review, I thought I'd better put a rating that was in the middle ground between my two opinions.The acting in the film is mediocre. Occasionally, there's the odd time where you think ""that was actually convincing acting!"" but at others you kind of cringe and think ""oh that was baaad!"" This is one of the reasons that I think it is aimed at teens, because it wouldn't seem as cheesy to a young mind, particularly if they're seduced by Robert Patterson!The script is kind of lame, and I don't know whether this is because the books were lame or not, because I've never read the books, but either way the script needs a serious rewrite if it will ever impress mature viewers.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Why was this movie made?,"Some movies are so good that they are talked about, often quoted and thought of almost with reverence decades after their first release. Twilight is not one of those movies. Twilight is fluff, utterly forgettable, and gives cause to wonder why anyone would want to make this movie in the first place. This movie is so nondescript and so devoid of anything that is even remotely interesting that calling it a bad movie would give it too much credit. In times past this movie would have been assigned to the B portion of a double feature and be given little if any notice. The story contains certain interesting features but at no time does it make any dramatic impact worth noting. The movie may work as escapist fare if you feel like going to the movies to take a nap, but given the high price of tickets today, that is not an advisable option. So if you feel like taking a nap, go watch this movie when it comes out on a DVD or better yet when it is shown on network television at which time you can start watching it and then go to sleep in the comfort of your own home.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Just trying to enjoy the movie for what it is.,"Don't spend your time comparing it to the book. If you just sit there comparing the book and the movie, you'll take the fun out of the movie itself.

I do understand why they made a few changes to please some of the moviegoers who haven't read the book. It ties things in a different but acceptable way. I loved how they interpreted the book. I understand that it was a teen movie so of course there was a little cheesiness at times.

"Heavenly Shades Of Night Is Falling, It's Twilight Time","When young Robert Pattinson enters the life of Kirsten Stewart he was sure like any other young man she was likely to meet in her small town in the Pacific Northwest.

And Stewart's character of Belle Swan and Edward Cullen have become cult heroes for this younger generation. Needless to say both older Swans and Cullens aren't crazy about these two kids going out. Still as another popular film of a decade ago remarked, somehow these two complete each other.This film like the Harry Potter series has inspired a bunch of sequels made and in the planning stage from the novels which are bestsellers among current teens.

"So your telling me Twilight gets less stars than ""Deuce Bigalow; Male Gigolo""","All of the haters and wannabe critics love to make fun of and tell you that this movie is a 4/10 and that they ""never even read the books cause they aren't a 16 year old girl"". Well as someone who was a 16 year old girl who read Twilight in book form and then enjoyed the movie years later... they did a great job on this movie! Whilst yes a little cheesy (some things don't always translate well from book form in most film adaptions). The acting was exactly perfect for the characters that Stephanie Meyers wrote. So even if they weren't the worlds best actors they did a great job in the role they were given. You try to be a hunger crazed teenage vampire who is actually 100's of years old, just met your soulmate who inadvertently happens to be your biggest weakness all the while ignoring your base instincts to kill. It's gotta be a tough gig.The cinematography of Twilight is beautiful and not just because of the scenery. Someone actually spent some love and care making this movie. They worked hard to respect the book and respect the atmosphere and feelings that it's meant to portray. This movie wasn't made for film critics or indie movie watchers or men or women who thought it was a joke even before they started it.

A little disappointing...,"I had just finished reading Twilight yesterday and was prepared to go to the midnight premier with high hopes of criticizing the movie based on the book. All-in-all, it wasn't a horrible movie, however, there were some small flaws that I found quite inaccurate.First off, Edward seemed more awkward than graceful. In almost every scene, his words flowed almost hesitantly from his mouth. The book describes his dialogue as ""silky,"" ""velvet"" and ""warm honey."" Also I had imagined him to be more confident than he appeared in the movie.Another book-to-film ""mishap"" that irritated me was the speediness of Edward and Hella's relationship. In the book, it seems to build up and Edward is EXTREMELY cautious and reluctant to even touch Bella. The film completely overlooked this, considering the first day Edward and Bella were together, Edward threw his arm around her as if he had no problem controlling his thirst.The final aspect that irritated me was the ""meadow scene."" This scene was absolutely atrocious! I'm not going to spoil anything, however, I think Twilight could have used some nice special effects for this scene.This is not a must-see, but it was still worth my $9.50",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"No fangs? Sunlight doesn't hurt? Oh, this MUST be a vampire film!","'Twilight' was one of the most hilarious movies I've seen in awhile; at least that's how it started. Reminding me a lot of 'The Happening,' I found myself laughing out loud during the first half and then simply hating life during the last half. I have heard this was meant for teenage girls. Fine, I get it and I'm not one. However, how I wish more for them. They deserve so much more. It's absolutely no wonder why this movie dropped its audience 62% on weekend 2. There are so many points to cover for this two-hour tragedy, I'll at least attempt to cover the incredibly bad aspects: awful, laugh-out-loud acting and dialogue/narration, horrible soundtrack, special effects were downright amusing, the bad (""Johnny Suede"") hairdos and the desperate attempts at a franchise ¬ñ let's just set up every scene to set the stage for the inevitable part II, III, etc. I'm just going to assume the people playing the parts (it's too nice to call them actors) read the original material. Well, the ""I can't live without you"" wooden dialogue seems like they are seriously reading from the book rather than playing the parts. And one of the worst aspects of this film was the fact that after all the lovey-dovey stares, (oh, God, the constant stares Bella and Edward give each other. STOP, please, God, STOP!) they seemed to forget one of the most basic elements in any plot ¬ñ the adversary. OK. Well, let's introduce one 3/4s into the film in the shape of Brad Pitt.

Painfully cheesy adaptation of a good book,"*A bit of a late review, since I saw this on opening day, but I wanted to get my opinion out on my new account.*I liked the Twilight book. It was a little flawed, but it's God compared to the film. I don't know what the critics mean when they say it will ""please the die-hard fans"". Well, I am a fan, and I wasn't pleased. It's not because I'm hard to please, even though I am, it's just because the movie sucked.I am not going to discuss the plot, it's about love and vampires, but I will discuss the film's strengths and weaknesses. One of the main weaknesses is the leads. Kristen Stewart is quite bland as Bella. Her face is expressionless throughout the majority of the film, and I did not believe her undying love for Edward. Robert Pattinson is, at times, good as Edward, however, his British accent comes through at parts, and he appears to be trying too hard at times.The digital effects are easily the biggest problem. They were very poorly done. The scenes where the vampires are supposed to be running extremely fast, their feet aren't even touching the ground. It just came off as cheesy and I found myself laughing at parts.Now, the film's strength comes from the secondary characters. The best were easily Charlie and Mike Newton. Billy Burke, as Bella's father Charlie, is nothing like the character in the book, but he had impeccable timing and he was easily the best character in the movie. Mike Newton was hilarious, his booty dance outside the caf√© stole the whole show.Edward's family, the Cullens, are more interesting than Edward himself. Carlisle is a bit flat at times, in my opinion, but did a pretty respectable job for what he was given to work with. Esme was very warm and is pretty much everything I imagined her to be. Rosalie is considerably bitchy, and I thought Nikki Reed did a great job. Emmett was not at all how I pictured him, but he was likable. Alice and Jasper are both terrific, though unfortunately underused. Since they are given the least lines, they don't have to utter such hideous dialogue as much as the others.In the end, the film is unsatisfying and not faithful enough to the book. Hopefully for New Moon, they will flesh out the characters more and increase the budget so the visuals aren't as corny. I'd say wait for a rental.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Book vs. Movie,"This is the difference between reading the book and seeing the movie: The book is like talking to a Bella and getting all the details of her story and really feeling emotionally involved with her and her friends and all the characters because she's telling you everything that she felt and remembered. The Movie is like getting to see some of her home movies now, but you don't get every detail, and a few of the ""memories"" of how Bella told you the story were a little mixed up and you feel like there is so much more and why couldn't she just have videotaped her whole life for a reality show . . . it's just not fair! Well, at least that's how I felt after seeing the movie :)But, having read the book, you can at least feel like you know ""the rest of the story"" and can fill in the missing details of the movie in you mind. I can see where it's ""important"" to see it more than once. The first time, I just kept thinking, ""oh, they missed something"" or ""that's not how it happened"", and it just seemed like chopped pieces of the story here and there. Now, I think I can go and just relax, being excited to review the parts of Bella's home movies that she does have and enjoy those parts of her story visually. The Movie did seem ""Low Budget"", and the make-up didn't seem consistent in some of the scenes, but then, as ""Home Movies"" go, the lighting is never the same and I can just rationalize it that way. Hope this helps you to relax and enjoy the movie, and re-read the book and see the movie again... and, I just can't wait until New Moon is released, or Midnight Sun is finished . . . and hopefully one day, the continuation of the story (please Stephanie).",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Enjoyable film,"I think this extremely popular book adaption film, Twilight, was a pretty enjoyable film to watch.

Now this is by no means going to win an Oscar, but for what it is, it's pretty fun and certainly not a drag.

not impressed,"Let me preface this by saying that I went to see the movie as a 'parental guider' because I didn't want to send my salivating 14yr old alone into the other 'masses' of salivating 14yr olds who had been waiting what seemed like an ETERNITY (only to them) to see EDWARD CULLEN! & co., no telling what could come of all that! I attended with ZERO expectation of any depth of character, storyline, dialogue, substance, etc. and it did not disappoint. In my opinion it was exactly all of that: shallow characters, so-so storyline, and dialogue that seemed unnaturally forced and to have amounted to about 5 typed, double-spaced pages for a screenplay. I left the movie with something I wanted to stress to my daughters more than anything else that Hollywood has, yet again, painted a false picture of love and how it looks in real life. This movie (and so many others), paints the hero character, Edward, as uber interested, involved, preoccuppied and concerned for the heroine, Bella, which doesn't even come close to real life is! Boys don't think like that. They don't care like that, that don't agonize over teen girls like that. Of course, I understand that he is a vampire has other fictional reasons to be drawn to Bella, but I think it still imparts a false image of what teenage boys are capable of into the minds' of the movie's target audience (young,impressionable, teenage girls). In actuality, it's really quite the opposite, girls can and some do pine and agonize and involve themselves in the lives of their boyfriends, but boys don't. Not that it could never happen, but the chances of it happening in high school are not likely and not desirable¬Öat least not to this mother of three girls.

"fun, adventurous film for the whole family","Fast-paced and mysterious, I love the way Twilight reels people in through their curiosity making them wonder things like ""are they going to get hurt?"", ""are they in trouble?"" or the general ""what's going to happen next?"". The film itself is packed full of action and thrills and has benefited by basing itself on the amazing storyline of the same name by Stephanie Meyer. The fact that the movie uses a fictional-fantasy idea that is also an action packed thriller it reels in an audience of an age group between around 12 to around 40. Although mainly for the teens and disliked by quite a few people, it had proved to include the whole family on some level. The film uses the latest equipment in film technology to produce amazing atmospheres in the film that make the dark forests and similar scenes seem both captivating and realistic.Whether the film may have been created to make the idea of the film seem like it could be real life is undermined, though, by the over dramatic performances by the main protagonist, Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart), and the almost forced emotional approach by the character Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson).Kristen Stewart was way too over dramatic in her part as Bella Swan and made 80% of her part seem like a sob story or a cry for help, reminding me sometimes of Elijah Wood's portrayal of Frodo Baggins from The Lord Of The Rings trilogy. Although she did well to capture her audience by making her entrance as the shy, uncomfortable, new girl seem both realistic, believable and relatable.Robert Pattinson was overly forceful in his attempt to be emotional as the character of Edward Cullen. While he got the eyes of the audience placed firmly on him, he lacked the natural human expression when feeling a strong emotion. For example: during the first kissing scene of the film he looked uncomfortable and shifty instead of the actual nervous and scared; and when trying to look sickened he overdid it and looked, frankly, constipated (I'm just saying...); and finally, when trying to look scared, he forced it too much and looked overly sad or angered. However, I give him that he did manage to capture his audience and reached the goal, enough so, that he went on to star in the last 4 installments of the book series.Overall, I would give the film a 9/10 for effort, but realistically given my overall opinion of the film I think it only deserves a 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Liberate te ex inferis: save yourself from hell . . . by not watching this.,"The only reason I never read Twilight when it first came out, long before it was popular, was because I read a book review stating that it was a clich√©d and traditional¬ótwo things that I hate more than anything. The only reason I watched the movie was so I could actually understand what the vast majority of America was talking about when they raved about it. I came with low expectations and an open mind. I reassured myself, after all, I do enjoy love stories when they're original and memorable, so this couldn't be too bad, right? Three hours later, I left the theater feeling as if I was just released from a torture device and struggled desperately to my car on weak legs that just walked through hell on earth. Is my last sentence melodramatic? Maybe, but compared to the cheesy melodrama that IS the plot of Twilight, me sitting through that atrocious movie looks downright life-or-death.From the first scene to the last, at least 1/3 of every scene in the movie is filled with nothing but characters staring at each other or at various things. I've never thought I would have to sit here and actually type up a complete paragraph complaining about the amount of staring in a movie, but, folks, the day has come. Bella meets Edward: they don't talk, they literally just stare. The vampire plot point is reveled: they stare. Bella is in a life-or-death situation: she stares at whatever is about to kill her. At one point, a car is ready to crush her, and what does she oh-so-realistically do? Stare at it.The acting is that hilariously bad. During the majority of the movie Bella has a look on her face that is a mix between being high and having an orgasm¬ówhile staring. Edward, despite what the horny pre-teen girls (and middle-aged women) want to believe, is a walking self-parody. Cheesy lines (that he repeats over and over again), unintentionally cheesy lines (""I'm so hot, and that makes me a perfect killer!""), and did I mention he's supposedly hundreds of years old yet he still acts like an angsty-creepy-weird-virgin-guy?So, how was the story? It's based on a novel, so it has to have a plot, right? Wrong. Put simply, vampire romance is the most unoriginal idea ever to hit literature. Not to mention movies like Near Dark and Let the Right One In already beat the overused plot bloody on the big screen. Essentially, Twilight in one line is: boy and girl fall in love, boy must sacrifice everything for girl as she sits there like a pretty Barbie doll (and Kristen Stewart isn't even much to look at here), then they both commit. And while you're watching it, it seems even less interesting than that. There is zero entertainment value unless you're a hopelessly horny female who humps her pillow with images of Edward in her head, or you're a hopelessly pathetic male who just wants to impress his girlfriend because he can relate to a ""emotional love story"". I can't comment on the former, but, seriously, I'm a guy who likes love stories and this is NOT a love story. It's a traditionalist middle school English essay with flat characters and no plot other than: put two horny kids together, but appeal to the ""dark"" crowd by making it a vampire story . . . without even showing fangs.Other dishonorable mentions: 1) Twilight = Napoleon Dynamite - the humor + stupid subplots 2) The ""Restrain yourself, Edward, don't suck her blood!"" scene brings unintentional cheese to a new level 3) The movie never ends; two hours seems like eternity (in hell) 4) Baseball doesn't make edge-of-your-seat action 5) There is no action 6) There are no real vampires unless you count pretty-boys 7) Stephanie Myers completely screws up the vampire mythsI almost feel sorry for Catherine Hardwicke. She's an amazing director, and she singlehandedly turned this stupid crap-fest into a well-done movie on a technical level, and everything else was out of her hands. But who would honestly turn down the money this movie would bring in? I don't blame her, I blame Stephanie Myers.I also feel sorry for the countless people who watch this and think it's a quality love story, thus never being exposed to the true love stories out there. What is Twilight? A horny, unoriginal, childish fantasies put into a movie. That, like always, wins mass reader, and now viewer, acclaim.

A good beginning to a five-film franchise,"The plot of the first film is really simple focuses on the development of a personal relationship between a girl named Bella Swan and vampire Edward Cullen and the subsequent efforts of Edward and his family to keep Bella safe from a separate group of hostile vampires.This film was in development for approximately three years at Paramount Pictures' MTV Films, during which time a screen adaptation differing significantly from the novel was written, but Summit Entertainment bought the film rights in 2007, and all of the other TWILIGHT books were sold to Summit Entertainment.Originally scheduled for release in December 2008, the film was moved to a worldwide release of November 21, 2008, after the sixth film in the Harry Potter film series, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince moved from a November 2008 release to being released in July of 2009.Catherine Hardwicke directed this film, Carter Burwell did a really good job with the musical score, and the movie's soundtrack is phenomenal with amazing songs like, ""Let Me Sign"" and ""Bella's Lullaby"", both performed by Robert Pattinson, ""Decode"" , performed by Paramore and ""Leave Out All The Rest"", performed by Linkin Park. Melissa Rosenberg, wrote the heck out of a script based on the first book of the same name by Stephanie Meyer.Kristen Stewart is great as the lead character, Bella Swan. She is attractive and really cool, but also really great as well. Robert Pattinson is great as Edward Cullen, but this was not the first film he was in, I actually saw him as Cedric Diggory in both the fourth and fifth films in the Harry Potter film series, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005) and Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007) and he really gave a great performance in this film.The two main actors were so great that they won an MTV Movie Award in 2009 for Best Kiss Scene in this film and they also shared a kiss at the award. This also won an MTV Movie Award in 2009, for Best Fight for Robert Pattinson vs. Cam Gigandet as James, Best Female Performance for Kristen Stewart, Best Male Performance for Robert Pattinson and Best Movie.Taylor Lautner, who was in both Cheaper by the Dozen films, and played the character Sharkboy in The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl, which came out in 2005, played Jacob Black, really freaking amazing. Billy Burke is also really good as Charlie Swan.Anna Kendrick is hot and sweet as Jessica Stanley in this film and something told me that she was gonna be in more movies and in 2012, I saw her as Beca in the film Pitch Perfect and she will be playing the role again in the upcoming May 15th, 2015 sequel to the first film, Pitch Perfect 2. Kendrick can also sing because I heard her sing in the film and she is really good.Cam Gigandet, Rachel Levefre and Edi Gathegi plays the evil vampire clan. The rest of the cast is very awesome, but also really good. So, overall, i love the first TWILIGHT film. It's smart, fun and a good way to spend 2 hours.Out of all of the TWILIGHT films, this one, the third film, ECLIPSE, the final two films, BREAKING DAWN - PART ONE and BREAKING DAWN - PART TWO are the best ones so far, but the worst one is NEW MOON, which I will get to. Acting is not bad, music and story, and visual effects is not bad at all. I give it a 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Really??? Were we watching the same movie?,"First off, I would like to open that I am an avid reader of the series and have read all four several times.I saw the movie last night at midnight after anticipating an amazing film. Not only did I think they did a terrible job staying with the book, but even someone who hadn't read them would be bored with this. I understand you cannot put every single detail into the movie, but there was so much time spent on Bella stuttering or climbing trees.The relationship between Edward and Bella hadn't been developed enough for it to be believable that they truly loved each other. It seems as though they were still tripping over words and being awkward, way too soon for an ""I love you."" As far as casting goes, I liked every member of the cast except Bella. She was absolutely dreadful. Bella was supposed to be shy and awkward, whereas Kristen Stewart just came off as stuck- up. Also, the Cullens' white faces were ridiculously fake- looking. Can't makeup do a better job than that? In short, I am also a huge Harry Potter fan. Not only are their books bigger but they also have a lot more detail. HP does a much better job staying true to the book, and has me on the edge of my seat the whole time. Twilight had me about to fall asleep and more entertained by my cell phone. It was an incredible bore.",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Twilight Saga is way underappreciated,"I say boy's the Twilight Saga is way underappreciated ! I own all five films.
I didn't listen to the critics or the people that said their trash. I went and watched them for myself. I saw all five films in the theater.Then I bought all five Blu-rays but I have not watched them; they've been sitting in my Blu-ray pile for like 10 years :oops:The entire cast is made up of extremely attractive people physically , so theirs that.
I am total sap for a romantic star-crossed lovers story line and is element is the heart of the films.
There is all kinds of delicious Gothic and romantic melodrama.
I've never really been a huge fan of vampires in the horror genre but it's done extremely well in this series of films.
I've always been a huge fan of the Lycanthrope and there's plenty of Werewolf action.Twilight launched two bona fide movie stars in Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson.

Better than today,"When I first watched this movie, I thought it was a dorky teen, soap opera but compared to the horrible movies of today, at least it had pretty actors to look at.

Wow,"I was absolutely shocked. The whole thing was awful! People started leaving because the movie was so badly made. The acting was horrible! Kristen Stewart was so dramatic and over the top, she kept blinking her eyes i guess to get some kind of dramatic reaction, and I didn't know whether she could breath through her nose or not. Rob whoever looked constipated throughout the entire movie and was so awkward to watch...The camera kept zooming in then zooming out and moving around...I can't even think of the right thing to say to this. I am so shocked i wasted my money on this. If i can save someone from spending their money on that movie I will.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Major letdown,"I am a fan of the book series, but this movie left me cold and hollow; kind of like Harry Potter 1 when the first movie opened. Like Harry Potter 1, the movie tries to do justice to the book by remaining very faithful to the actions and dialogue, but when all is said and done, there's none of that eerie, magical feeling behind it. Hopefully if this film leads to a sequel, the sequel will be a better overall experience. Kirsten Stewart is perfect but the rest of the cast, even Robert Pattinson, is overly melodramatic. I must say that the effects and make-up are kind of weak, also, ESPECIALLY for 2008! Sometimes the fight sequences seemed straight out of the last decade. Well, I suppose I'm going to get hate-mail from all of the die-hards now, but here it is anyway: My opinion- Meh.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
It's not that bad but it's just awkward.,"Talking about Twilight is like playing with fire. If you have real constructive criticism about this, you will probably burn of the whole world. If you say something positive about these movies, all the haters will hunt you down and kill you. If you say something negative, all the crazy girls will follow you home and choke you in your pillow. And if you say both positive and negative things I think they will first fight over you: who can kill you? Twilight is a teen movie that is way to depressing for a teen, but too over dramatic for an adult. Also, all the characters are just very awkward.

I know it's cringe but it's my type of cringe,"This movie. This saga. This film franchise will always be my favourite. When I was 10 I first picked up the twilight comic book. I had never been so starstruck in my life. I was completely in love. The summer i turned 11 i had read the entire book series. All the 2500 pages. And I had a want for more. I was completely and inevitably inlove with Edward, Bella and the storyline. (Jacob does not count as a storyline or a mere character in this setting.) When I for the first time got a hold of one of the movies. It was the last one.. I watched it over and over and over on Dvd. Until it almost broke.. I was very much in love. Then when i got the entire dvd collection. I took it with me everywhere, I watched all of the movies at least 4 times a week. Edward was my biggest childhood crush, and he still is. (Also a reason why i'm such a big fangirl of Robert Pattinson..) The twilight movie franchise was something me and my sister bonded strongly over, me and my friends watched together over and over, and something my mother had to endure.. I am quite harsher of a critique now than i was before, but this movie will always be a 10 for me. Edward, Bella. They will always be a 10 for me. Even though the movie in itself may not a 10, it is for me in sentimental terms. This movie, or THESE movies will always be my comfort. That is why i've rated this movie. A 10.

The Most Underrated Comedy of the 21st Century,This movie is so stupid.

A Review from a Film Buff and not a Reader of the Books,"Keeping all cynicism about the popularity of the series aside, this film is honestly an extremely stupid movie. The production values are horrible (you would think that they would make the flying realistic) and the acting is nothing more than looking into each others eyes. The script is but a few throw-away love words that are meaningless and corny that, had it not been based on a bestselling book, no producer or director would have ever made.I tried, truly, to keep an open mind, but it was hard when the script and acting were so weak. Twilight was a very, very bad movie. The only reason I gave it two stars is because the director at least tries.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"Well, it wasn't as bad as ""Manos""....","The Twilight franchise has always given me the willies. I found the books to be an affront to women and portrayed a terrible model of what a 'relationship' should be. I was dragged to the movie by a dear friend, but came out of the theater smiling. It wasn't for the plot or the acting, but for the future joy I know I'll experience when Twilight hits DVD. I intend to MST it into oblivion. The dialog was just... laughable at times.The entire movie made me giggle.My biggest complaint has to do with Edward's piano playing skills. If he's 100-something years old, why isn't he playing some Liszt or Rachmaninov? He had all this time to get Really Stinking Good, but he chooses to woo the ""girl of his dreams"" with a piece a second or third year piano student could play. Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoyed the music from the movie, including that piece, but I just think that something a little more complicated might have been more suitable given his age and presumed experience. I'm a violinist by trade and have very little knowledge of how to play piano, but after 2 hours in the practice rooms I've almost mastered the right hand of the piece. Next time he should bust out ""La Campanella."" That said, go see Twilight if you need a little laughter in your day. If you're a die hard fan, don't bother.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Though weak it's still strangely satisfying,"Yes, this is very much a teen romance movie. Yes, it's filled with gringy flaws and completely unbelievable twists. And yes, Kristen Stuarts acting is almost unbearable to watch...(I mean, what the hell is going on with her face twitching and looking tormented all the time?!)
But still it's a movie that reflects the attraction people have always had with the sensual and seductive side of the vampire myth. And the tension between Bella and Edward is also satisfying to watch. So if you can relax and just accept all the awkwardness, you can definitely enjoy this film (and the sequels as well).",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
The Essence of Hopeless Romance,"As a hopeless romantic, Twilight is definitely on my ""comfort movie"" list. I suspect that I've been a bit broken since I watched it for the first time, and honestly, I love it. To this day, I find myself waiting for my vampire lover to materialize out of thin air and save me from any danger-what a dream!The disbelief that Edward, who seems to have never fallen for anyone, would be interested the dull Bella Swan is a common topic of discussion. This actually makes the story even more special, offering the comforting notion that everyone can be seen as extraordinary in someone else's eyes.The idea of a love you can't live without truly feeds my soul. It's the perfect dive into a fictitious reality, where romance reigns supreme. The details match the book remarkably, capturing the essence of the story that fans adore. The soundtrack is captivating, adding an emotional depth that elevates the entire experience. There are moments that are undeniably clich√©, and that only adds to the charm. Twilight transports me back to being a pre-teen whose only goal in life is to find love, and I wouldn't trade that feeling for anything.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Awful director+Awful script=Awful movie,"I read the first 3 books of the Twilight series and the movie is true to the novel.I think that's what made it so bad. In the book, the character Bella is pathetic & suicidal, and Edward's obsessive and controlling. While you can ignore those traits in the book, seeing them come to life on screen is scary. I don't think that the author realizes that Bella is in an abusive relationship and neither does the majority of her teen fan base.It looks like the director had mental images of the scenes she wanted to capture when she read the script, but didn't think through how the scenes would make sense within the film. The soundtrack doesn't fit either. The special effects consisted of sparkle powder, white powder and maybe some wire up in the trees tops to capture the flying/running scenes. The casting isn't great either. The guy that plays the dad is miscast, and so is Jacob. The other characters simply can't act, or weren't allowed to by the director or author.Watch this movie is you want a good laugh and have $10 to waste.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

"If you haven't read the book, don't bother","And, if you have read the book, then maybe you shouldn't bother then either, but for different reasons. Those who haven't read the book might get confused, or in the case of my friend, annoyed at the inconsistencies. Some of those inconsistencies wouldn't be a problem if she had read the book. A person shouldn't have to read the book a movie was based on in order to be entertained, or to know what on earth was going on. Those who have read the book will most likely be disappointed, unless you're a tween girl fascinated by Rob Pattinson. No offense tweenies, I was there at one time, too, and I do remember . . .I've read all four books and took a friend who hasn't read them. I was bored and I knew the story! You can only imagine how painful it was for my friend to sit through the picture. I had hopes (not high ones) that the picture would take care of the things in the books that I found so unessential and annoying to read (disclaimer - I'm not her target audience in fiction, so not surprising I had difficulty with areas of the books). Stephanie Meyers created an intriguing and wonderful fantasy world, and though her characters aren't deep and rich, they're still engaging. The script for this picture failed to capture what's interesting about Edward and Bella's relationship as well as the fantastical world in which they dwell. The dialogue completely fails. It's choppy and unnatural, except for three or four lines scattered throughout.It's a shame director Hardwicke chose to hang onto large panning shots -by the 20th one, we didn't care! Good film storytelling would have established the world and hinted at the conflict in the first 30 minutes, then hit the ground running with the baseball scene (where in the book, everyone's roles are firmly established and the conflict begins full throttle). Instead, my friend and I had to sit through an hour and forty minutes of melodramatic dreft before the conflict truly began and by then, we didn't care - though by then I was thankful that I had read the book. My friend was ready to leave - but she toughed it out.The actors all did fine work, more so since they didn't have good material with which to work. They definitely earned their pay, as well as the adoration that's being sent their way (more than likely though, the adoration is not for their fine acting talents).Finally, a note to the writer and director - if you have to resort to voice over, neither one of you has done your storytelling jobs.",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Vampire yarn without much of a payoff at the end...,"Nothing much really happens in TWILIGHT except that the script attempts to tell the touching story of a boy and girl who meet in school, fall in love almost immediately and find that they have a strange attraction for each other that turns them into soul mates.Even stranger is the fact that the girl (KRISTEN STEWART) is played in rather indifferent fashion by the actress who is supposed to be the girl that turns all the male heads in her direction the moment she appears on the campus. She is neither pretty enough nor charismatic enough to deserve all that ogling in my opinion. But, hey, that's what the script says so we have to accept that no man can resist her. And stranger than that, the boy just happens to be a pale-skinned Vampire.The boy Edward Cullen (ROBERT PATTINSON) with the pale skin and red lips, turns out to be a member of a Vampire family who develops an overly protective attitude toward the girl, as well as an overwhelming desire to fall in love with her. I suppose this is the sort of thing that set female hearts beating quickly--the sight of a handsome lad setting his eyes on a vulnerable girl who only gradually learns about his true identity. And then, what is she to do?Catherine Hardwicke has directed this tale of tender love about to blossom between a girl and a Vampire with a keen eye for some glorious woodland scenery and gushing music that gives the young lovers the proper romantic background. Pattinson convincingly plays a Vampire who doesn't want to harm the girl and would rather keep the relationship more distant, but the girl has fallen for him so completely that this becomes an obstacle he cannot overcome. The ending affords little in the way of a resolution.Easy to see why the tale became a teen favorite when it first appeared, but this was my first exposure to the film which was showing on the FX channel on TV. It's not as bad as some of the comments would have you believe but it stirs up only a mild interest in seeing further films in this series should I come across them while surfing the channels for a watchable movie.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Not horrible,"When these came out I only watched the first one. I didn't think it was horrible as it kept me intrigued enough to make it completely through without turning it off. Back then it definitely wasn't my thing so I didn't watch the others. This weekend all of them were on marathon style so I decided to watch again. Still feel the same - not horrible, not the greatest but still held my attention enough to watch all 5 of them this time. I wasn't impressed with the storyline of Breaking Dawn part 1 (4th movie) at all as it lacked any amount of excitement. I had to look up a few things on google that were happening bc I didn't read the books and either I missed its explanation in the movies or they didn't cover why it was happening/what it meant. I can see how this would appeal to the young crowd, at least back when they were originally released. There are many movies I watched when younger that I can't even sit through now even to feel nostalgia, so that's why I decided to give this a 7 rating.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
The book is better - but this deserves far more than 5.3/10!!,"I'm quite late to the Twilight party, but having recently discovered (and devoured) the novels, I could not have been more excited when i saw that all the films were available on Prime.This was great! Yes, the book is far better. Edward and Bella's relationship is better in the novel. Kristen Stewart was perfectly cast, but Robert Pattinson - whilst very good - played Edward very stoically. Book Edward actually has some spark and humour about him, which is what attracts her to him in the first place. Also, the book's gorgeous meadows scene - where Edward is boyishly proud of himself for being able to (just) resist Bella - is all but removed from this film! (Not to worry filmmakers; it's only the book's most iconic scene.)Mike was also a bit miscast; I imagined him less macho and a bit shyer when I read the books. But some parts were glorious: Carlisle was perfect. Kristen Stewart, as I said, was amazing. And what the hell - if you liked the books, this is definitely worth a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Better Than the Source Material Demanded,"Though it was originally widely criticized and mocked for its strong blue filter, awkward portrayals of the primary teenage characters, and goofy low-budget special effects, Twilight (and its predecessors) lives in the collective consciousness all these years later as an iconic franchise brimming with nostalgia.With a relatively small budget, Twilight was somewhat limited in how technically impressive it could be in the special effects department but the way production members worked around it ended up working out just fine. For small moments where the vampires' super speed isn't integral to the story, there's a cheap edit where those individual characters' walking gets sped up and, despite it looking strange, it doesn't really become distracting or impact audience enjoyment. In turn, dramatic fight scenes near the end crucial to the plot are given much more time and stunt work, bolstering the film in the most essential places without getting caught up on every single detail getting there.I don't find any of the acting performances to be particularly excellent, but I also don't find them necessarily overdramatic within the supernatural world of the story. Because the film is filled with various types of shots/camera angles far from the cookie-cutter formula and it's rife with dreamy sequences and perfectly paced editing, the focus of the movie often becomes the aesthetic and feeling.Interspersed with the desperate angst of teenage love, there are moments of youthful joy and playfulness from both the essential group of main characters (Edward, Bella, Jacob, and Charlie) and from the side characters (Jessica, Mike, Angela and Eric). In someone else's hands, the film adaptation could have very easily left out a lot of the interactions between Bella's friends that ground her in the human world.As time passes, I'm more grateful with every rewatch that Catherine Hardwicke included the side characters in so many scenes- even if it's only for a few lines at a time- because her regular participation in normal life sets up the stark difference between what her life is and is fated to be (so far) compared to what she guesses Edward's to be like. Having him (and/or the other vampires) present in so many scenes throughout the entire first movie would've lessened the novelty of their supernatural abilities and the mysterious guise that fascinates Bella and it would have shot the future movies in the foot in trying to open those non-existent relationships up for the first time when the romantic plot at the forefront becomes heavier.One of my other absolute favorite things about this movie, and I would say even more so than any of the subsequent films, is the soundtrack selection. Oftentimes, teenage romances are scored with catchy and relevant pop music- and I don't necessarily think that would have been terrible in this film- but the indie music that was chosen feels specific to this film and its visuals. Not to mention that it offers a more timeless quality as well, a keen choice for a film where many of the characters have been alive for centuries.Also lending to Twilight's perpetual relevance is how carefully era-specific references were avoided. There's no mention of pop culture figures, flashy cell phone models, reading the characters' text messages or emails over their shoulder, or notable fashion microtrends in the costuming- all details that freeze in time and prevent it from feeling old and outdated by smudging the plausible timeframe of the story over a couple decades.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Disappointing.....,"Being a fan of the twilight books, I was very disappointed when I saw it last night.The acting was horrible to say the least. Kristen Stewart is usually great in her roles, but in this she seemed like she wasn't even trying. The character of Bella bored me to death in this film. Robert Pattinson was probably the worst actor in this film. Robert poorly represented the Edward that millions of people became infatuated with. His acting was stale, but that may be do to his inexperience in front of the camera. In the book, Edward was extremely romantic and to millions of people he was the perfect guy. However, in this film there was really nothing about Edward that made him stick out from the rest of the guys at his high school (besides him being a vampire). The scene were Bella in Edward meet in class was laughable and their relationship seemed very forced.The Edward/Bella relationship was horribly depicted in this film. I did not feel the connection between them was as strong as it was in the book. Their lust for each other came up fast and for someone who has only seen the movie would probably wonder why they even like each other. I personally feel that the director should have spent more time developing their relationship because when/if they make the second installment, I am going to have a hard time grasping why Bella is so depressed about Edward leaving her.I would have to say that the biggest flaws in this film was the casting and how choppy the scenes felt. This movie didn't exactly flow and the best word I can use to describe it is.... choppy. Twilight would jump from one scene to another in a way that really distracted me from enjoying the movie (especially in the beginning of the film).Overall, I was very disappointed in a film I've waited so long to see. I hope that the next installment of the Twilight series has a new screenwriter and a director that takes their time to make a great film. The cast will not change but hopefully for the second film they will get better.Rating: 1.5/5",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"Ludicrous, but in an interesting way.","Here is a film that just feels wrong in so many ways. The film, as you all probably know by now, is about a girl and a vampire who fall in love. I understand that the idea of a girl falling in love with a vampire is rather fascinating since vampires are often depicted as being very sensual and strange. However, the idea of a vampire falling in love with a human to the point where he refuses to suck her blood makes no sense. It's makes as much sense as a dog falling in love with dog food. The humans are the prey and the vampires are the predator. However, that's just the tip of the iceberg.I have several questions about this movie and I have several confusions. My main complaint about this movie regards the female characters. They're all weaklings. Why do female characters always get depicted as weaklings who always work in the kitchen and must let the big strong man fight the battles and defend her? Why can't we have a popular movie with a strong female character? It's stupid! There's no women to look up to in this movie. In addition, the main female character, Bella, is just as lifeless as the vampires themselves. I actually thought that she was a vampire at the beginning of the film because she was so much paler than everyone else! There's one scene where she has to pretend to be a vampire and I thought to myself ""That should be hard!"" Then they make a big deal out of it as if it's the ultimate challenge or something. It's really funny!However, that brings me to my next complaint. The lack of conflict. Why do nearly all the characters, including the head vampire family, have to be so damn unusual and strange and quirky and kooky and bizarre? What is the deal with all the male characters being surrounded by so many women? Why on earth does a vampire's skin reflect and bunch of diamond-like shards? Why doesn't their skin burn? What is with all the racism toward the Native-Americans??? Why are they getting called wolves? Why is the Bella character so popular when she appears to be so anti-social? The sole highlight of the film is Taylor Lautner's character. Taylor is a truly beautiful boy and I feel bad for him that he's involved in such a project.How does anyone not notice a man stopping a car with his bare hand when he pauses for a long time after he does it? Why doesn't Edward just constantly suck Bella's blood if he can do that without turning her into a vampire? Why do the vampires have to play baseball in the rain? These questions, and many more, which I can't reveal without spoiling the plot, ran through my mind throughout this film. The camera-work is awful. There are so many close-ups that you can never get a good look at anybody a lot of the time. Other times the camera just swoops and sweeps around for no reason. The narration kept on taking me out of the movie and never really matched what was going on in the plot. This film is a complete mess and I'm surprised that so many people are so obsessed with it.I actually did enjoy the movie, believe it or not, but there is no doubt in my mind that it doesn't work. This film fails to provide any sort of moral. It fails as a love story. It fails as a vampire film. It fails as a coming-of-age movie. It just doesn't work. I'm not going to bother not recommending it since you've probably already seen it anyway. I was just stating my opinion. Years from now, fans of this movie and of the books and of the films to follow will look back at this and feel ashamed. This movie is going to age like crap.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"Twilight- Awful, Bad, Horrible","I was one of the many who went to see Twilight at midnight. What a huge disappointment. After the movie ended I wanted my money back and the two hours of sleep I missed. The movie was disjointed to say the least. It was evident that they did not have a large budget and that good actors were hard to find. If you never read the series and saw the movie you would walk out of the theater confused and asking ""why the hype"". If you did read the series, you walked out disappointed and asking ""what was that?!"" Is that it? Is that what I was waiting months to see! Here's the deal. The beginning of the movie was seriously rushed. They took different parts from the Twilight book and created scenes¬Ö not a movie. It didn't matter where those scenes where in the film as long as it got in. The order of the events as they took place in the book obviously wasn't important to the director. It's like they wanted to cram everything from the book into the movie but didn't care about the films flow from one scene to the next. In truth, there were many scenes that should have been left on the cutting room floor. These scenes were just made up and didn't add anything to the story line; not that there was an actual story line. What a mess! This film looks like it was created by a first year student film maker. The acting in this movie was awful. It was more like watching a high school play rather than a motion picture film. I really expected better acting skills from both Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson. Actually Robert Pattinson wasn't that bad, but the movie was so bad it transferred to him. Their performance was mediocre at best in some scenes and in others it was down right bad. As for their co-stars, I pray they have other aspiration outside of the world of acting. The background music in this movie sounded like the music you hear on your favorite afternoon soap opera. Listen, I love the Twilight books. True, they are not great literary works, C+ at best, but what made the books so popular was the story itself. It brought you back to a time when you got your first kiss, the first time you fell in love and the feeling that you couldn't breath or your day couldn't start until you saw that one person; the love of your life. The Twilight movie totally failed to capture the essence of the book; the reason fans love the series. It failed to do what the book did, get the audience to relive the feeling of falling in love for the 1st time. If it wasn't for Robert Pattinson's good looks the film would have been unbearable. They need not make another ""film"". And for those who think Twilight is the new Harry Potter. Please! The Twilight movie has nothing on Harry Potter films. Harry Potter films have good writers, a great director, action and a fluid flow of events and coherency. Twilight was lacking in all areas. I plan on rereading the book so I can block out what I saw the movie. The directors and writers ruined this movie and Stephenie Meyer gave this junk her seal of approval. She needs to complete and published Midnight Sun to make for this horrible film.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Esme Cullen (Elizabeth Reaser) is a bowl breaker.,"Stephenie Meyer's novel ""Twilight"" is adapted for film by Melissa Rosenberg. Melissa kept the essence of this Gothic Romance and most of the story in the film as to not disappoint the readers. Elliot Davis's Cinematography makes this film a perfect candidate for Blu-ray.This is a standard story of a girl (Kristen Stewart) with tasty smelling blood, type unknown, meets a vampire (Robert Pattinson) who cannot resist a nibble.The film is set up as a beginning series so some characters just can't/won't die.Lots of inbreeding, fighting, and a never-ending love story.This is a first installment of a series of films.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Wow this was complete crap,"I watched this with my girlfriend (who told me it was complete crap) with the Rifftrax commentary running (yay for rifftrax!) and I found it amusing (the commentary not the movie). The movie was bad, I mean really bad, we're talking Plan 9 bad here, lame plot, terrible acting, storyline so thin I was afraid the screen would tear... Basically this movie is designed to appeal to 10-12 year old girls, the kind of audience who do not know what romance is but want to experience it with the ""dangerous"" guys. It will appeal to the kind of person who thinks stalking and sexual assault are signs of ""love""; and that a guy who want to kill you and drink your blood is the perfect boy, the target audience seems to be the kind of girl who proposes to serial killers on death row.

"Why, was this created?","This movie was just god awful. The first two minutes in when I watched the movie, I was like 'God! I want to commit suicide.' Although I never read the Twilight series, and god forbid I NEVER WILL... I decided to watch the movie... I think brain cells nearly popped out of my head when I saw this.First off, why in the name of god does everyone in this movie LOOK SO BLAND AND PALE!? Is it the camera, or did someone say 'Hey! You know what this movie needs? Pale and blandness! That's sure to make it better!' Pfft... right! Also, the movie seems so dark and depressing. I guess that's the theme of the series, since it's based around vampires... which is a stupid idea if you think about it, but it makes me so suicidal that I bring five packs of razorblades every time I see the stupid thing. Not to be harsh, but that's how I feel about it.I will admit though, there are some nice camera shots and some nice music within the movie, but the movie is more of a depressing romantic story about two emos who like each other... yeah, way to go! And... sigh, there's another coming soon. God, kill us all!",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
God awful film. Decent enough books.,"The film serves as a collage of well-lit slide-shows for Twilight series. Tragically, that's the lonely upside. Just about every aspect of the film-making beside cinematography was poorly executed. Poorly scripted, poorly directed, poorly edited, poorly acted (why Bella and Edward can't stop shivering their heads during conversations)... even the set of Cullen residence looked ridiculous. For fans or want-to-be fans of Meyer's saga, save yourself some money, google or fetch photographs online... IMO that proves a superior substitute than bearing 2 hour worth of this dreary.I believe the director made a grave error filming only the first volume into this film. She should combine both Twilight and New Moon into the same 122 minutes. Meyer's writings spent a great deal of time recreating visuals for readers, visuals for every surrounding, every facet of protagonist's psychology, which quality acting/production would trim away in few strokes. What's left was too shallow for a full length feature to sing. So.To be honest, the books aren't that spectacular, either. Although, they do grow on you if you have a free weekend, and a few ounces of patience to read through all four at once.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
The Utter CRAP that was Twilight,"Okay so they tried. But the movie isn't worth spending $7 to see. I felt like I was watching a spoof of Twilight, kinda like Another Teen Movie but really bad. The only good part was sitting next to my girlfriend, holding her hand and sharing popcorn. The movie was good, but you can't call it ""AWESOME"" like some people have...even if you are a Twilight fan. Hell, ESPECIALLY if you're a Twilight fan. A real fan would probably have flipped at that movie. Yeah, it was exciting getting to finally put faces with characters and things like that, but the movie itself just didn't hit right. Edward was way to...forced, I guess. The dude tried way too hard. Edward is suppose to be charismatic not weird. The ""Hold on spider monkey"" comment by Edward was also really uncalled for and had the extra crap like that been left out the movie would have been much better. There were just too many key scenes left out, and I think it may be difficult to transition into New Moon without dropping out even more of what made the novels enjoyable. All in all it was maybe a 6 out of 10. Hopefully New Moon will be better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Worse Than A Soap Opera,"It would be good if it were a spoof but that's the only good thing I can take away from it. It's unbearable to watch this girl Kristen Stewart try to act and Robert Pattinson isn't all that much better. Stewart does this absurd stuttering that I know has nothing to do with the character because every interview of her displays the same boring characteristic. Therefore, she is not an actress, not in any way. She's only playing herself and she has no charisma to begin with.This is worse than Days Of Our Lives. The acting is at the same level if not worse as shown by every single actor on screen. There are horrific visual effects, a ridiculous script even if it is an adaptation, horrible directing. Why were any of these actors chosen. I don't get this and I don't think anyone could legitimately explain it to me other than having some tween scream in my ear some unreasonable bs.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Incredible!,"When I first watched the movie, I hadn't read the books. I had heard of them but decided to see the movie to decide whether to read the books or not. And the film impressed me a lot and still does today! It is a low-budget film, unlike the other films in the saga, and that makes its quality even more impressive. It's amazing what Catherine Hardwick, the director, managed to produce on such a low budget!It is an excellent adaptation of the book, and what caught my attention the most was how well the city of Forks and the entire setting were built in an extremely realistic way. You really feel like entering this magical and mystical world. The soundtrack is beautiful, the entire cast was very well cast and well directed (the same cannot be said of the other films).I've watched the film several times, it always gives me great pleasure to feel the energy that emanates from this work.

When you get to the last one you want another then another. When you get to the last one it is time for it to end you want there to be one more.

Read the book. It's so much better than the film.,"I did not like the acting, directing, or screen writing in this dull and awkward film--but, primarily, the blame seems to be on Hardwicke and Pattinson. His characterization, however, was intriguing.Stewart sulks a great deal. The best scenes were with her father. But, the sparks between Bella and Edward never seem to catch on fire.Part of the blame seems to point to the film's lack of development. Relationships are or should be an integral part of the film, but there seems to be no attempt at getting to know what motivates and stimulates the characters.The film lacks emotion and poignancy, moves too fast, and gets stuck on a subplot--which, in my opinion, could have been deleted from the start or edited out after viewing the rushes (if scenes mid-way into the film ended up on the cutting room floor, they never would have been missed).Special effects were poor, but were obviously added to compensate for the poorly-developed script. Hardwicke came through with the teen, but was absent in some very-important scenes, but this may be a problem with the direction rather than the acting.""Twilight"" misses out on effectively probing the things that each of the characters wanted, but could not get. The film is a metaphor for sex, but fails to tell a compelling story to hold one's interest. Because the focus is blurred, there is little or no clarity. And, the film is not well grounded.I rank the film a 6 out of 10--but, if the film was better developed, it would hold more promise. As is, the chemistry does not really work. ""Twilight"" ends up leaving its audience completely in the dark.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Awful film,"The poor quality of this movie really sets a low bar for the film industry as a whole. Unfortunately, thanks to a severe addiction to novels, I had the (dis)pleasure of reading Twilight several months before the film came out, and basically took the book for what it was - a semi-erotic vampire story in which Stephanie Meyer took her own ""romantic"" (I use the word loosely) ideal and put it into words. To further clarify, as if it weren't clear enough from the author herself, the book is her own version of erotic fan-fiction. The plot itself is laughably simple and the romance is creepy, and seems to enjoy creating a vampire lore that makes them look about as fearsome as rabbits.Nevertheless, I decided to give the film a chance. After all, I've seen mediocre books turned into good films - Prince Caspian being my notable favorite. Within ten minutes of the film, I was bored and on the verge of leaving the theater. I decided to get my money's worth and sit it out, which was an unpleasant experience thanks to the fact that I and my brother were surrounded by middle school girls - and I think my brother fell asleep. It was probably the fact that the sun, a vampire's *main* weakness, made Edward's skin ""shimmer and glitter"" and the fact that he had no fangs or attributes of a vampire. It probably didn't even help that the basis behind Edward's attraction to Bella was flimsy to the point of being laughable.There's so, so many things wrong with this film that even the novel isn't responsible for. The acting is on a level of horrid that I would expect from far less seasoned actors. Pattinson is a pretty above-average actor, and coming into the film industry as a teen heartthrob, it's probably enough for him to be on screen and for girls to ogle at his face, but for most other people his acting was stilted and his lines delivered with the fakery that only someone relying too much on his looks could possibly pull off. There is a reason why less handsome or beautiful actors are usually better at what they do, and it's because they have to make up for their visual deficiencies. He obviously didn't break the pattern. The actress, Kristin Stewart, was slightly better, but it was offset by the fact that she overacted her way and blundered through the film.The werewolf's role was boring, forgettable, and probably not even worth noticing, as were most of the peripheral characters, like the other vampire gang and the vampire in that gang who Edward battles, whose name I can't be bothered to remember. This film wasn't just a waste of my time, it was a waste of money and I *beg* people not to watch this travesty.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
In the top 10 of worst movies I've ever seen,"I didn't read the book so my appreciation has nothing to do with a comparison between both film and written versions. Although the camera, photography and sceneries are very well chosen and executed, the script and acting are so lame and full of clich√©s that I didn't even finish the movie. Luckily I caught it on TV, and I feel sorry that someone spent even one cent on going to a movie theater to watch this. I just hope that they redo the whole casting again, perhaps they can find some actual actors -not just pretty faces- to perform. What a waste of film, money and time. I pray for the day that Hollywood producers stop taking the audience for granted and start thinking about making their money worthwhile.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Nothing Special,I just saw this movie (dragged by my friend) and wasn't expecting much. I thought the commercials looked pretty stupid and I generally hate any movie where they hype it up on the news and there's dozens of thirteen year old girls with signs screaming about how much they love whoever it is that's in the movie. It was a bit better than I expected but not much. The storyline is pretty stupid and the acting is average at best. I hear this is going to be a series of several movies (based on several books?) and I don't really see it doing that well as a series since the novelty will wear off after this film and this film isn't that good. I won't see another one of these movies anyway.,,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Poorly done in an odd way,"First, the good news: Scene location and set dressing was very good. Assistant Directing, as seen by the fact that the extras and bit players did an excellent job and the job of managing them is usually given to an AD, was excellent. Wardrobe was good as well. The make up was second rate but okay. Continuity was fair to good. The set designer did an excellent job.Bad News: The musical score was horrid and poorly edited. The music suggested to me a cell phone conversation going on behind me for how it distracted. The screen play was rushed and out of cadence. It suggested that the screenplay was written by a pack of rushed and angry Girl Scouts, some of whom read the book. The entire movie had the feel of a poorly written Cliff Notes read at a slumber party. For instance, who chose that mid sized town? That was a BIG mistake. If you are going to alter the book, do so in a manner that compliments the visual medium of a 'film'.The main actors had the potential to do well but, in my opinion, their miscues and poor cadence was a directing error and did the main actors no justice. Whomever coached or directed the extras and bit players should have directed the rest of the movie.All in all, I was vastly disappointed with the film. Some might say, okay, tell us what you would have done! Okay, first, the washed out, falsely 'indie' nature of the initial scene in Phoenix could have lead to the slowly resolving clear, crisp greens of Forks (ala Wizard of Oz when Dorothy steps out of her house in Oz)as she falls in love. Hell, give me a reason she fell in love (missing from the visual media). The wings behind the vampire (white owl wings) suggested a movie filled with interesting metaphorical scenes (ala an old fashioned 'European' film) but that hope faded as well. Oh, and did I say the sound track was horrid? An after school club full of Junior High students with MP3 players and access to third rate instrument packages found in the toy section of Wal Mart could have done better. The only passable music came at the end.The movie sucked all the life out of the book and left a dry husk to stumble about in front of a camera whose motions were directed by a disinterested person named 'director' for some reason. In that regard, the movie was pornography with the actors wearing clothing and the sex scenes as washed out and empty caricatures of the emotions barely perceived in the background.I welcome rebuttal.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

"Cringeworthy. I don't need to say anymore, except for this.","OK, so this movie is about a teenage girl named Bella Swan who moves to Washington to live with her dad. While in school, she meets a boy named Edward Cullen who she later finds out is a vampire, and they soon fall in love with each other. Don't let the interesting plot fool you.Kristen Stewart (Bella) can't act in a drama for her life - she just can't. The main acting she does in this movie involves shrugging, staring awkwardly, and blinking; yes, blinking. She... just...never...stops!Robert Pattinson (Edward) is almost just as bad. Even though his character is already whiny and melodramatic, he only makes it worse.It's not just those two-almost all of the main acting is horrible! The terrible acting really reflects the bad direction, the special effects and stunts are shoddy, and the dialogue-oh, the dialogue! It will only make you laugh, like in one scene where Edward is about to climb a tree with Bella on his back, and says to her ""you better hang on spider monkey"".Try watching this movie for twenty minutes without getting annoyed-just try. There are just so many parts that make you want to cringe and look away, waiting for it to be over.

Twilight stench flows through the world,"OK. I'll admit, i've seen Twilight a total of 3 times, i've read the first novel twice and i'll tell you something, it doesn't get ANY better. I would first like to start by saying that the books are good, for what they are that is. Stephenie Meyer is an awful writer! And really needs to give the thesaurus a break. Anyway. This movie was the biggest disappointment since Lemony Snicket's ""A series of Unfortunate events"" hit the big screen. I admire Chatherine Hardwicke's directing technique, but not in this film. She took a descent novel and turned it into an atrocious film.Twilight lacks enthusiasm, chemistry and excitement. I was ready to sleep watching it the first time. However, i gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried again, to no success. The cinematography is appalling as is the acting skills of Robert and Kristen. I must say that I am a fan of Rob and Kristen and they really should have thought twice before signing on to this garbage. Kristen does not suit the character of Bella at all, regardless of the fact that she resembles the character physically. How many girls don't? brown eyes, brown hair, pale skin are not too hard to come by. She just does not have the spunk Bella needed and her monotone acting frustrated me to no end. Robert was also failed by the crappy script. Not only is he forced into a monotone-like state, but he also lakes the magnetic pull of Edward. Twilight isn't a hard novel to adapt, add two spunky actors, a lot of chemistry and a good director and you're on your way. But sadly this lacked all of the stated. The ""chemistry"" between rob and Kristen is the biggest laugh of all. They look so incredibly awkward that it makes me wonder what they really think of each other. Perhaps Kristen was to scared to really sink her teeth into Rob because of her long-term bf. Who knows! but one things for sure, both must'v failed chemistry in high school. No disrespect to them as actors of course. And Finally, I must say, that there was no suspense, as there is in the novel. No sexual tension or anything! No build up to the big revelation. The film stayed on a straight run the whole way through. It was the dullest load of **** I've ever seen. I just hope the next director does a better job, good news though, is can't get any worse than this!So, save yourself the trouble (and money) and ignore this ""phenomenon"", because this movie is definitely a waste of life. Go see Changeling instead- that movie has quality! :)",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Amazing DOP dose not disguise a missed opportunity,"First of all, this film looks amazing. The director of photography had done an incredible job, even if the CGI is a tad to obvious in places. Just to get that out th way; now onto the bad stuff.For all of its failings, the Twilight series has a simple message of comfort for coming of age girls about the perils of relationships and the pain inherent with the joy of first love. All fair and good one might say, however the toned down films offer a far more damaging life lesion of how teenagers should approach their blooming sexuality, portraying a safe, rose-tinted depiction when in reality relationships are hard and rough with problems other than how to deal with overwhelming affection when separated (as is the case of the second instalment New Moon). Not that relationships are bad and destined for failure, don't get me wrong, but the relationship between Bella and Edward is playing the fairytale card too strictly to the letter when it should really be guiding its impressionable young audience with something more tangible to what they will actually face. In reality, teenage boys are commonly ravenous and rather selfish beings out for themselves and all the sex they can get, making the vampire a highly symbolic medium, so a girl in love with a vampire is a great way to portray the terror that is the adolescent male and his undying lust for¬Öwell lust draining her of self-worth as she continuously pours her unrelenting love into him. Yet in Twilight Edward is patient an almost comically nonsexual, his emotions suppressed, happy to simply stare into Bella's eyes or sneak a rare passionate kiss. Now we have a woman whose urging desire to be bitten (representative of sexual congress) needs to be slapped down by Edward, who fears her becoming like him. Now from a certain feminist perspective can understand why this film is considered as a positive influence for young women; here we have an independent female protagonist who knows what she wants and refuses to back down, but when her goal is ultimately to be subject to her man the argument looses its momentum, even becoming somewhat hypocritical.Going back to my earlier statement, monsters are steeped in symbolism ‚Äì each and everyone reflecting a very real human fear, trait or outlook. As the lead male, Edward is representative of the vampires we see throughout the movie, with those acting like the classical parasitic vampires coming off as heinously villainous in contrast for simply doing what they have to. What I am getting at here is that Edward's vampirism is wasted potential if he refuses to ever act in any way like a vampire. I realise the point is he believes he is evil incarnate and so must fight to suppress his nature, but in the context here it just plain fail if Bella is more blood hungry (well, she's certainly hungry for something of Edwards) than he is. Surely Bella is a negative influence on Edward for trying to make him abandon everything he's been working so hard to achieve just so she satisfy her needs. In this light, Bella is really the more monstrous of the two.My biggest problem with these films and books is that they play the teen monster card to safe and child-friendly ‚Äì like if Disney were given the reigns to remake the Hammer Horror catalogue. Puberty and monsters is a dream combination, as it's a time of great uncertainly, self-awareness, new sensations and rapidly changing body and emotions to contend with; it's a goldmine of potential that only films such as Ginger Snaps and the more recent Let The Right One In have utilised in the last decade ‚Äì and these were strictly speaking not American (Canadian and Sweden respectively) so were untainted by the overdone sentimentality of their Hollywood cousins. In Ginger Snaps the repressed sexuality of Ginger is unleashed after a werewolf attack that triggers her delayed puberty. The werewolf motif is initially unrecognised for it mirrors the traits of puberty; hair growing in new places; a changing body shape; uncontrollable lust (albeit for blood); and bouts of emotional instability. Even when a male character is infected by the lycthropancy virus after having unprotected sex the symptoms manifest like an STD rather than an urge to repent for his misdeeds. This is far more realistic a portrayal of the teenage years and sexual awakening than Twilight is willing to employ, and I find it disheartening to discover that a fluffy piece about unconditional love over between to emotionally dead and rather vacant people is a global success while the superior mediums are regarded as cult or niche. I understand that in a time of fearful and unwanted change its comforting to have films like Twilight there to hold your hand and give you head a reassuring pat, but kids need to learn that hardships coming or it will be all the harder to deal with the difficulties of boys, sexual peer pressure and the nightmare that is puberty. To this end, a film about the suppression of desire in the face of first true love is more harmful than one in which people are maimed, eaten and savaged ‚Äì at least they know how to vent their frustrations and desires rather then bottling them up for the inevitable post office massacre in 30 years time.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Unsuitable for my daughter,"Every afternoon before she returns from school I search my daughter Emma's bedroom for anything that might contribute to her moral decay. And every day throughout the years my fears were joyfully unfounded as I rarely had found anything morally questionable. My little princess has consistently maintained a clean, morally upright personal character. That is, of course, until I discovered this PG-13-rated, sacrilegious DVD in the back of one of her drawers, conveniently hidden beneath some of her Bible study materials.Never in her life have I been so disappointed in my otherwise bright, beautiful daughter.When she returned home from school that afternoon I confronted her wide-eyed and furious about my findings. She denied it was hers at first, but eventually admitted to receiving this item as a gift, claiming she had only seen parts of it at her friend's house and liked what she saw but had not yet seen the entire thing. I went ballistic, yelling until I was physically weeping and red in the face as I told her how seeing something like this would ruin her mind and scar her for life. Then I grounded her for two months to hammer the point home. She tried to explain to me that the movie was ""not evil,"" that it was ""tastefully made"" and that I would not object to any of its content. ""Right,"" I scoffed. Then, confiscating the ""Twilight"" DVD I smirked in disgusted amusement as I thought, ""she'll watch this DVD over my dead body."" About two weeks later, with nothing better to do I took a deep breath and decided to watch this DVD. I was pleasantly surprised at the beautiful love story that unfolded before my eyes amid an ugly world of despair, vampires, and werewolves.

"Very Much Worth It, But Don't Compare it.",I LOVE Twilight very much and i will admit i had high expectations going into the movie and i don't think it disappointed. I got to see it twice tonight and during the first time i will admit i was searching for what was and wasn't in the book but the second time around i just sat back and watched and it was REALLY good. Compareing it to the book is unfair and to go in thinking you are going to see word for word scene for scene of the book exactly how you imagined it in your mind is really stupid in my opinion. Just go in with the mind set that you are just going to see a movie that looked good in the trailers and you should be good. don't compare. Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson have extremely intense chemistry together and even if you are not Team Edward you can't help but root for them.Each other character although they had small parts were all very good as well and the movie has a sense of humor about it that i really enjoyed. All in all i give it a 9 out of 10.,9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
overrated its just one word for it..,"The movie has nothing. The act is horrible - same face all the time. No fun, no horror, no love, no excitement, no color, nothing new..at all. I'd would really like to have a argument with someone over thirty who thinks that this is a good movie. The books is probably great, but that doesn't make the movie great. I've heard that some people thinks this one is better than ""HarryPotter"" and ""Lord of the rings"" together....what !!!!! Talk about bad taste...I hate overrated movies, its like ""Lost in translation""...kind of.If you wanna see a vampire-movie, there's plenty more films. If you wanna see a love story, there's even more films with that theme.

awful movie,"I really did not enjoy the movie.I finally gave in and watched it because of the hype its received. ,mainly from teenagers and young girls who haven't a clue however. I just thought it was a bad movie. Nothing really happens in it.The fact that the vampires sparkle in the sun rather than spontaneously combust in descent vampire movies like blade or 30 days of night is a joke. The effects when the vampires move fast are terrible, smallville has better effects and its a TV series. I will not be seeing anymore of the series. Also they have rushed the release of New Moon within a year of twilights release in an attempt to milk it for all its worth and so i think it will be equally bad. The werewolf looks awful from the trailer. The vampire genre has suffered a bad blow.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
An entire generation of teenage girls...RUINED!!!,"Now the phrase 'dragged to the cinema' is commonly used by people who end up watching a film on the silver screen that they feel embarrassed about having watched. These movie goers know that they have witnessed a truly horrible film and want to forewarn the entire world not to see it, while somehow still maintaining their dignity in having actually watched it in the first place.Now I'm not going to lie, I have never so much as thought about the Twilight saga, read any of the books or anticipated any of the film releases, but I do recall going out on a date with a girl whom I had a certain penchant for, and in willing to please her we went out, got something to eat and had a nice time. And then she suggested we watch a film in the adjacent cinema.Now at this point, alarm bells rang. I knew she was crazy about Twilight. I mean, she had already watched the film TWO times in the cinema and it had only been out for a week. But, as is my chivalrous and relaxed nature, I went along with it, telling her that she could choose the film as there was not much out at the time. But in the back of my head I knew what I was getting myself into.I mean, where to start? How about with analysis of the word 'saga', which comes from early Scadinavian and Germanic settlers and means 'epic or legendary tales'. How this term can be so much as coined to describe this plight, nay, disease that is the scourge of the earth at the moment is beyond belief.There was nothing that I saw in that film that even made me want to think about watching or reading anything related to the name 'Stephanie Meyer' again. She has been blacklisted from my subconscious, and this travesty of a 'saga' is dead to me now, despite having only scraped the surface of thisNow, I have watched films such as 'Trolls 2' that has been given a rating of 2, and Twilight does not hold a candle to that film. Literally. I would honestly choose that film over this 100 times out of 100. I would in no way describe myself as a film snob, though I would never go out of my way to watch a film that has been ill recommended to me by like minded movie goers, but Twilight is the anomaly. The film that proves that sometimes the most shameful target audiences can prove the most effective - the teen/tween female population who have watched too many sappy animations (I love Pixar releases so this isn't a jab at Disney as a concept) to believe that this storyline could happen to them if they squint hard enough and imagine.When it actually comes down to me describing the film, the inclusion of Muse gained it one star, whose publicists must be lapping up the adulation at the moment, though whom may be regretting it as soon as the band release a song about vampires and werewolves. The storyline isn't even a bad one, and I could imagine the books to be at least somewhat readable in a very acute (LSD?) state of mind, but the film screams money. Simple as that. And as I count, I believe we are on the 3rd or 4th one now within the space of 2 years, and my hypothesis then rings true now.The acting was wooden, the 'romance' was transparent, the fight scenes were laughable and yet this girl (both the one sitting next to me and the big manly one on the screen) was lapping it up! Swooning when Edward 'sparkles' (how a girl could find sparkling an attractive quality in a man is beyond me) and crying at the end when they declare undying love for each other, that was read straight off of a cue card.Suffice to say I haven't spoken to her since.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
twilight is horrible,"I loved the books and was very excited for the release of the movie. But boy was I disappointed. The characters were wooden and I think I have seen better acting in a high school play. The casting director must have slept through the auditions. The only characters that came across as halfway believable were Charlie and Alice. Bella had one look, like she was constipated, I don't think she smiled at all. Edward didn't appear to have any depth. The movie took the exciting parts of the book and smashed them together without any character development. If I hadn't read the books, a number of things would not have made sense as there was no attempt to set them up or connect them. In my party there was a 12 year old girl and even she was not impressed. For anyone thinking about going to this movie, I recommend that you save your money. I would go to the next outing with the Twilight Saga, but only if it had a different director, editor and cast; otherwise it would be a waste of time and money",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Pure Magic...for a non-Twilighter anyway!,"I don't see what all the whining is about...speaking from the perspective of a ""non-Twilighter"", I was so highly impressed by the film that I bought the book today. See, I randomly won four passes to go to a pre-screening party of the movie on accident, and I almost sold all of my tickets. Luckily, I didn't because by the end of the movie, you would have thought I was Twilight's biggest fan.First of all, I thought Robert Pattinson did a commendable job as Edward Cullen. I started reading the book today and as I read Stephanie Beyer's words that introduced his character to the story, I realized this. Sure the real Robert is a bit scruffy in real life, but he groomed up nicely for this role! He had the certain eeriness and mystery of Edward and he SURE look GORGEOUSLY AMAZING! His eyes weren't ""dead"" to me---they enhanced that element of eeriness and mystery, if you ask me. And for the audience---gosh---it was like each and every person in the theater fell in love with him as his eyes glistened on the screen.I don't believe Kristen Stewart looked ""boring"" or ""unemotional"" in the movie. It was more like a certain vulnerability or naivet√© that she brought to her role, and I thought it worked well.The two had amazing chemistry in my opinion.The story moved a bit quickly, but that's about the only complaint I have. Oh yeah...and that Jacob guy...his teeth were SO unrealistically light I almost got blinded. He was also a nice addition to the cast.I also thought the lighting, which was dark and made everyday seem like there was thunderstorm outside was suitable for the theme of the film. I heard people complain about that.Anyway, that's what I felt about the film. It was well done and if you're not a Twilight fan...TRUST ME when I say you will be after the movie. I went in with an ""Ughh...a VAMPIRE movie...are you serious?"" attitude but was left with the greatest feeling of awe and amazement.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"If You Are A Fan Of The Books, Don't Waste Your Time","This movie was nothing like the beloved book series we have all come to know and love. It was very apparent that neither the director nor the screen writer took the time to read this wonderful book series because I believe that the movie would have been amazing if they did.There was just so much in the movie that bugged me...like the meadow scene. That scene is the reason why there IS a Twilight series, and for them just to blow it off made me mad. They didn't talk about Jaspers power or history. They just made him look like he was on something a horrible .People were laughing at parts of the movie that weren't even supposed to be funny, Bella and Charile ate out instead of Bella cooking.

I know people say ""You shouldn't compare the book with the movie"" but you can't really avoid it, you put so much effort in reading the books, the characters means something to you. When a director makes the movie out of the book, they are putting what they saw, and their opinion into the movie. I honestly didn't really like the directors way of interpreting Twilight. I will be completely honest and separate the book from the movie and say, if i watched this movie without reading the book, i would think it was an so-so movie, I wouldn't be as crazy to see it if I didn't read the books.

Terrible... just plain terrible,"I honestly can't believed that I wasted 7 dollars and change to see this so called film.

About 30 minutes into it, I started to look at my clock every 10-20 minutes hoping it would end soon enough. This has got to be one of the worst films of this decade. The fact that this film garnered so much attention still leaves my head scratching. The acting was atrocious. I've seen better acting in an elementary school play. The leads had absolutely no chemistry. All the dialogue seemed forced rather than natural. I kept laughing quitely because of the horrible script and how each actor spoke it.

Bad Director Catherine Hardwicke Makes Another Bad Movie,"This is getting endemic in Hollywood: They keep on hiring bad directors to make their movies and cast wanna-be models with a complete lack of acting talent and think this is the recipe for success.Is it any wonder DVD sales are falling every year with movies like this? Catherine Hardwicke has a pedigree of never making anything that even resembles a good movie, but she does have the hype backing her up so she keeps being hired to destroy projects: case in point Twilight.How is it interesting to cast a bunch of bad actors, light them poorly and dress them in drab clothes only to shake the camera around as if it were a magic wand that would somehow make this movie watchable?

Nowadays with CGI stuff, movies can be glorious, but easy to forget. Compared with twilight, even the CGI and make up weren't that good(especially first 2),still can real get into head, almost impossible to forget. Soundtrack was well paired, the order of scenes made it very dramatic than books, but the communication is less touching than books.

Cheesefest!,"When you can live forever, what do you live for? is one of the themes of Twilight, Stephenie Meyer's best-selling novel with the cult-like female fan base, the latest of a string of much-awaited pop lit-based flicks to explode on screen.The first of a series of four, Twilight is told from the point-of-view of high school transferee Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart), an ordinary girl from Arizona, who risks everything when she falls for teen vampire Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). The reluctant beau realizes he has bitten off more than he could chew (pardon the pun) with his choice of girlfriend, when he has to forever fend off every mortal and monster out to get her.A modernized myth ensconced in a forbidden love story, director Catherine Hardwicke had a similarly against-all-odds task of pleasing audiences, most of which are hard-core fans of the book. Since much of Twilight's power is said to come from Bella's thoughts, this can of course only be visually executed in a limited fashion. The protagonists' feelings are also very reliant on the intense looks and expressions exchanged multiple times, and the actors successfully transmit their frustrations to the audience, despite the widely-held opinion of getting a cast that fit better. Can't please them all! And so, equally moody music like Debussy's Claire de Lune and other more modern angst-ridden faves ""15 Step"" by Radiohead and ""Supermassive Black Hole"" by Muse is interspersed throughout to sustain the teen drama, but could not distract the audience enough to feel the full (over two hours) length of this movie. Not only was it overlong, it was painfully cheesy at several points, but for female teens to fawn over Twilight would be understandable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

But overall, Twilight was so yawn-worthy, I walked out of that theatre thinking...""Thank God I got in free.""If you think it's worth 2 hours of your life, go on and mosey to see it.

Fantastic for Fans-Critics will be Critical,"Considering all aspects of this film, it's fandom, and birth from a very long, tough to condense book, Catherine Hardewicke, Melissa Rosenberg, Kristen Stewart, and Robert Pattinson worked some serious movie magic. Fans of Stephenie Meyer's series will be, for the most part, thrilled with their interpretation of this vampire love story.Screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg, with the help of Stephenie Meyer, created what I believe is the best possible script, dialogue, and scenes. Condensing over 500 pages into two hours of screen time while still conveying the major issues that are so important to fans is no easy feat, and she succeeded admirably. I think that any flaws should actually be blamed on the fans themselves, and their insistence of certain key phrases, that, while perfectly played out in the imagination, would sound slightly corny even said by say, Streep and Day-Lewis.That being said, the actors who portray the main characters, vampire with a heart Edward and every-girl Bella, are explosive. Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart played the roles to perfection. Instead of falling into the expected lovey-dovey, stary-eyed version the characters seem to call for, they seem perfectly uncomfortable with the entire situation, and each other. Instead of being like two magnets who are drawn to each other, they are like polar opposites, pushing away from each other. This dynamic gives perfect credibility to their should-be unattainable love affair. After all, they should not feel comfortable with each other; Bella's life hangs in the balance every second she is with Edward. Edward's fear of hurting his ultimate love, and the self-loathing he has for himself are constants in the novel. They prevented this film from becoming a sappy, camp, teen love story, which would have probably appeased critics, and lost 98% of their fans.While critics will criticize everything from the lack of big-budget stunts to show off the remarkable skills of the vampires, the sometimes cheesy dialogue, and the staring actors for what they will undoubtedly title ""emo"" performances, fans will know better. They will see how the tempestuous emotion and drama of Edward and Bella are perfectly executed by Kristen and Rob, neither over- nor under-done; they will see the impression of vampiric feats that truly no studio could recreate, regardless of the budget. Most importantly, they will see the distilled, concentrated version of the story they love so much, brought to life by an amazing cast and crew.Bottom line-if you're a fan, enjoy the movie in and of itself, and leave your book comparisons at the theater door. If you're a critic, well...don't be surprised if people ignore your probably plausible jabs at the film's imperfections. The magic of movies is that they affect each person differently, and each person impresses their own vision onto the film. Hardewick and Co. have given us just the right amount of our vision and theirs, turning out a film destined to be talked about by both critics and fans alike for years.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Enjoyed it probably more than a married woman almost 30 should have...,"I didn't care to see this movie in the theatre. I've heard of the books, but not read them.

I'll give her that.) ... but as I strolled through my local movie store today, I picked it up... practically looking around to make sure no one watched me do it. It felt like a guilty pleasure... like a carton of ice cream or something (even at 27 I'm far too mature for such nonsense, right?) BOY, WAS I WRONG.And just like a guilty pleasure, I enjoyed every second of it.I wished I were Bella... even if that meant going back to school - just to have a freaking awesome hot, romantic, protective boyfriend... one with a delicious secret that only I was privy to.It had that very ""us and our love against the world"" feel without being overly dramatic or cheesy.This is definitely the kind of book I would have picked up about fifteen years ago and gotten a wicked crush on Edward just like everyone is now.I might even go back and pick up the books before they make any more movies.Guy or gal, any age -- I would recommend this movie w/o a second thought.

A waste of time.,Twilight has been one of the most pointless movies I have ever sat through in my entire life. The acting is painful and the story is awful. The vampires are unimaginative. Vampires are normally known to be stealthy since they can't go in the sunlight but instead this suggests that vampires are great big diamonds that sparkle in the sunlight.The fight scene at the end is a rip of power rangers just cheaply done. The only reason why this movie is praised is because of Robert Pattinson but he just gives a really bad acting and along with a silly big square head.All in all watch the movie if you can tolerate awful acting.

Still a better love story than La La Land,"""Twilight"" is already the title of a 1998 thriller. I wonder if ""Crepuscule"" or something would work?Watchable piece of Gothic Urban Fantasy Romance with a great atmosphere in its foggy little one-horse town and a very likeable heroin. I'd marry Bella Swan...Everything is realized with skill and panache making it quite enchanting if you're willing to turn your brain off for a bit.My big issue with this movie is the same one I had for My Neighbour Totoru: there isn't really enough conflict or stakes to constitute an actual plot until just before the final leg.Let me explain what I mean: I assumed that in this movie Bella would have a bad time for a bit and then find happiness in the attention from the handsome older supernatural man taking an interest in her even though the romance would be forbidden. Although Bella is understandably a little melancholic about her distance from her Mom and her new surroundings, she actually isn't bullied at all, she makes friends easily and there are two boys after her. And these boys are two DIFFERENT boys competing for her than the two who are in the sequel.Her Dad actually buys her a car. It's not an amazing car but it's something. Also, everyone on both families is just way too nice about the romance. Not one of the vampires even gives an impression of not trusting Bella. There are so many ways that conflict could be drummed up but aren't.The last act is also rather tacked on. It feels like they realized that they had sort of run out of ideas (by which I mean, miss Meyers did) and conjured up some villains ex nihilo. A similar problem is also found in Totoru.But to it's credit, Twilight's version of a tacked-on climax is used as an opportunity to explore its themes of temptation and immortality and it's only the first quarter of its story anyway. I know how weird this must sound but the Twilight Saga is a bit like The Ring of the Nibelungen in its structure: four parts, with the first really just to establish some themes, characters and relationships. So when people tell you the Twilight is one quarter of a movie, they're right. That's what it was meant to be.Twilight is an inevitably fascinating picture for the phenomenon it has been culturally. I sincerely believe this shift in how we want to see vampires tells us something about our culture and Meyer's own Mormon faith only adds to that. Edward is a vampire but he is one divorced from the religious subtext of Stoker or Polidori. He is not a demon, he is just a man (note how I didn't say ""person"") dealing with original sin and temptations he knows he might not be able to control so virtuously tries to resist until he cannot anymore. He is blessed and also burdened with an immortality of sorts and the power to bequeath it but is unwilling to do so too easily, much like the Mormon God. (seriously check out Mormon theology; it is not Christianity as you think you know it).The element with the Native Americans too is interesting given the racial element of Mormon scripture, this tribe sort of serving as a stand in for black people.Having read the book, I think it captures the tone of the book and gives it a professional polish as well as anyone could hope it would. Go in with an open mind and really suspend that disbelief and I think you'll find something quite passable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Disappointed!!,"I may be an older Twilight lover, but I am keen enough on what makes a good movie.

This would sure be better if everyone were trying a bit harder...,"Hating on Twilight in book or movie form has lately become a way for pretentious self-appointed critics and lecherous ""players"" who hate Stephanie Meyer's views on sexuality to establish their ""street cred"" with their fellow losers on the internet. To be sure, I can see why guys would tend to keep their distance from this series; in book and movie form alike it's got ""chick flick"" written all over it. The focus is firmly fixed on Bella to the point of rudely shunting several potentially interesting subplots aside.On the other hand, unlike a great many of my fellow males, I can also understand its appeal to the girls who are its target audience. To any of the aforementioned blowhards who profess not to understand its commercial success, I can only say: the continuing presence and profitability of the Lifetime Channel and its movies-of-the-week must also be quite the baffling mystery to you. Hey, Twilight is all about a shy girl who can do no wrong and doesn't realize how ravishingly attractive she really is being at the center of attention for every single guy in range, including sexually idealized vampires and werewolves. What part of that, pray tell, would not appeal to young girls in their more awkward years of adolescence?My main complaint about this film is what a waste everyone involved seems to have made of their potential. It's overlong for an adaptation of what was a relatively short and easy read of a book, and a lot of what would have been worth keeping from the book (a brief recounting of the Cullen clan's history, a scene in which Edward demonstrates that yes, he can still eat human food though it no longer appeals to him, etc.) is cut in favor of lots and lots of awkward silences, awkward stares, and awkward conversations that come off looking and sounding like nothing more than padding. Yes, such awkwardness is actually pretty common to real life. No, we in the audience do not care to be bored with these long pauses. Come on, cast and crew, do we really have to spell this out for you? The story's supposed to be a massive overdose on romantic feminine fantasy with lots of sexy vampires and werewolves thrown in. What part of that description calls for mundane realism?Speaking of awkward stares, the relationship between Bella and Edward in this movie seems to consist of almost nothing else. I can understand the ""show, don't tell"" principle behind some of this (though Bella's many voice-overs are, I might point out, a massive violation of that principle), but what's being shown isn't really what we're supposed to be seeing according to the book. What we should be seeing is Edward as a predator who's falling in love with his prey. Heck, that's simultaneously the Twilight series' greatest appeal to its target audience and most disturbing aspect to its critics: that a lot of girls are strangely turned on at the thought of being the subject of a troubled handsome guy's obsessive and nearly-uncontrollable desires, even if those desires come dangerously close to making him a creepy stalker.So fine, Stephanie Meyer wants this story to be all dark and edgy by exploring a predator's appeal to his prey? Then let it be dark and edgy. Let us see Edward licking his chops with that creepy gaze that fairly shouts ""Why, Bella, you look good enough to eat!"" While we're at it, fans and critics alike have noted that the whole Twilight series is a big metaphor about sexual temptations and promoting chastity. Fine: that metaphor actually mixes pretty nicely with the whole ""A shy girl loves a stalker..."" theory to make it the somewhat more palatable ""...if he's polite about it and keeps his grubby paws to himself until she willingly gives herself over to him.""As long as we're being darker and edgier here, there's no need to apologize for those creepier implications: let the metaphor be writ large! Let Edward alternately stalk and try to restrain himself from stalking his prey, and let Bella mistake his hungry looks for the belligerent sexual tension it seems to be (and to which it does eventually convert). That's certainly better than what we actually saw up on the screen, which is Edward looking passive-aggressive and bipolar and not the least bit interested in Bella for either culinary or sexual purposes while she understandably keeps asking him what his problem is. Where's the chemistry?While we're at it, since the movie departed considerably from the book by cutting away from Bella to other characters once in a while, why not roll with this by showing a few more scenes from Edward's point of view? In the book, he tells Bella something along the lines of ""You don't think you're especially attractive? Yeah, well, that's because you don't have to hear all the other guys' thoughts the way I do."" Letting us hear a sampling of those thoughts from his point of view would have gone a long way toward making this a better movie.Hey, for all the narrowness of its appeal and the flack it gets, Twilight isn't really a bad flick. I've seen worse; in fact, I've seen a *lot* worse. What I'd really like to see, though, would be everyone trying a little harder. Were the cast and crew mostly just making this movie for the paycheck? Hey, that's all right: a lot of Hollywood's best movies were made by hardened mercenaries who'd rather have been doing something else. That's still no excuse for writers, editors, actors, and producers giving us a mediocre performance, though. It might not be quite Oscar-level material, but this story had the potential to be a very entertaining movie; how very disappointing to see so much potential frittered away.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

How is it possible to make a dull vampire movie?,"There's no doubting that I'm not a member of the intended market for this film (a good thirty years too old, alas) and it's equally true that I'm also of the wrong gender, but the phenomenal success of this film is puzzling to me. It's quite difficult to make an uninteresting film about vampires ‚Äì although quite a few have succeeded ‚Äì but this, the first of a franchise, set amongst a high school milieu recognisable to its target demographic, is as dull as the palette director Catherine Hardwicke chooses to paint her picture with.While I like vampire flicks, I don't really like films that play too much with accepted vampire lore. Twilight doesn't so much play with its conventions as totally re-invent them for its own somewhat cynical purposes. Twilight's vampires have no fear of daylight ‚Äì they just turn a pretty silver colour when exposed to direct sunlight ‚Äì which means they can interact with humans, go to school, hold down a job ‚Äì as a doctor, no less; they have no fangs, no fear of water or holy symbols, and they don't feed on the blood of humans, choosing instead to chow down on wild animals. In fact, in many ways they're a typical all-American family: prick your thumb and suck the blood and you'd be as much of a vampire as these guys. (Perhaps I should amend that last sentence to typical dysfunctional All-American family).Of course, this makes the prospect of becoming a vampire a not unappealing one; after all, you get to live forever and, if like the lead vampire here, you get turned in your teens, you get to spend eternity appealing to pretty girls of a similar age. This being aimed at teens, there's a strong identification with the trials of an outsider. The young heroine is the new girl in town whose father is the local cop, and the vampires are outsiders because of who they are. All of which makes them appealing to teenagers who feel the world doesn't understand them and who are subsequently unsure of their place in it.To be fair to the author, it's at least a fairly unique idea, and the Twilight books have clearly struck a chord with young teenagers. The film is reasonably well made, and while it won't make a particularly enjoyable experience for most adults, it at least doesn't cut corners in the belief that it doesn't have to try as hard simply because it's aimed at a less demanding than average target audience.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
My honest opinion about Twilight,"I know I will be a head hunted and ""wanted for dead"" now. But this is my honest opinion about Twilight.Let's face it, Twilight is the new generation of youth films; sexy young vampires and werewolves having that 'special look', and I sat down open minded and wanted to like it.Unfortunately, while watching, I kept on thinking Harry Potter with vampires (sorry girls) - all young people learning and finding love killing the evil ones. The only positive thing I can say about Twilight is that it has damn good effects. The story is insulting ordinary, the acting the A-W-E-F-U-L to the max and the chemistry between the actors non-excisting.I have absolutely no doubt that young teenage girls will fall in love with the drop dead(!) gorgeous Robert Pattinsson, but I doubt that any other will find anything interesting about this all hyped up, ordinary and highly overrated film.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Great - But why does it look like a film school project?,"While the movie Twilight doesn't cover *all* the heart throbbing teenage angst and romance, they did do a great job of the material the makers chose to cover. I had to swallow my original comments about Pattinson as Edward, on the whole, he did a very convincing love struck vampire, and Kristin Stewart played admirably (although her emotional gamut never seemed to stray from either awkward confusion or awkward desire).The filming was, again, for the most part, a breath of fresh air. The clunky transitions and hand-held shots did make the film feel slightly more ""indie"" than Hollywood. This is where my ""school project"" beef starts however, as it did begin to feel like young punks with a camera trying to strut their stuff. Some of the camera work seemed contrived and distracting. If it was a film school project we'd have to fail the special effects fellow, as Edward's vampire jumps came complete with motion trails and the none too subtle ""whoosh"" sound effect. Somehow, blazing along the forest trails with Bella on his back he could move fast enough to incur the ""whoosh"" sound byte without causing Bella's hair to move, or to provoke even the slightest reaction out of our sedate heroine. It was also jarring to see the ""immortal"" Edward clinging for dear life to the tree tops while supposedly showing of for the more serene Bella.The greatest support to my film project accusation however is in the casting. It was as if they took a classroom of actors and assigned them all roles. ""OK, you are Bella, and you would make a great Edward... lets see where we can put the rest of you..."". Particularly the Cullen family - Dr. Cullen was not the charismatic vampiric patriarch from the books, and really - that hair dye and makeup... Esme looked one step from barefoot and pregnant with three little children clinging to her knees (why not an actress like Michelle Pfeifer?). Is Hollywood so short on gorgeous blonds that they had to take a ""cute"" brunette and give her a wig to represent the siren-like 'Rosalie'? The other actors were passable (exeption Gigandet for the villain James - sorry, you couldn't pass as a high school bully). But for me the real let down was Alice. Although Ashley Greene is a good looking girl, she brought nothing to the slight nymph-like character that was supposed to be Alice.Overall, the movie was quite good, but also a frustration. Why, with the mountain of support of millions of readers (and their millions of dollars) could they not have taken the movie a step further and come out with an unforgettable film, instead of the B+ film school product that they ended up with?",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Horrible & Clich√©,"I had read the Twilight series long before it hit number one in the book stores, I wont lie, I thought the book was alright, over exaggerated and clich√©, but then it really hit me, Twilight is in actual fact a cheap rip off of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles, those of you who have read her vampire chronicles will know what I'm talking about. But anyhow, that's another story, this is about the movie isn't it? Well, well, well, to sum it all.. my user name is rather appropriate for this review considering I nearly DID have a nervous breakdown watching the film. The acting was dreadful, Isabella Swan AKA Bella was mono-toned throughout the entire film, and to top that off Edward looked seriously constipated. Throughout the film I thought it impossible to stare at each and everything as much as they did, but once again twilight proved me wrong, you CAN stare at things for an entire movie! Joy to the world.. not. The movie itself was a bore, little happened beside the staring of course. OH! And might I add the effects were dreadful, the crappy blowing of Bella's hair as she walked in, her eyes meeting the constipated vampires, instant love.Horrible, dreadful, boring.

Could have been...,"Is it any good? Yes, it has its moments. But it's nowhere near it could have been.I wish the movie had a bigger budget. I keep deluding myself that more money'd have done miracles. The real trouble is that the movie is lacking an imaginative and talented crew. Kind of sad, really.The screenplay is generally bad. You have to be very creative when it comes to expressing feelings without the first-person narrative. Sticking to the book is not nearly enough. The result was weak.Instead of intensifying the emotion the music is spoiling a lot of the scenes. The art direction isn't satisfactory either. The visual effects are shameful for 21st century cinema. The story is chaotic. The director had no sense of how to develop the romance. The few truly intimate moments between Bella and Edward are not as expressive as they should have been. I felt deprived from my initial feeling.The only good thing is the acting! Despite the bad direction and screenplay Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart manage to portray the magic between Edward and Bella.Of course, it's not enough, because the rest of the factors are missing. Instead of enjoying their acting, I was caught by the production's failures.My admirations go for the two young actors and the efforts they've put into saving the story.

I came, I saw, I sat to the end.So yes I won, but at what cost?Well it's 90 mins I could have contributed something to society with that I'll never get back, however as Bella knows, we make our choices in life and that is that. Twilight is about as awkward and goofy a production as anything I've ever seen. Kristin Stewart, this gen's Jennifer Love Hewitt, loves shaking her head around before and after every line of dialog. I was shaking my head before and after every line of her dialog too. Robert Pattison I believe to have actual talent behind all that white powder on his face, but he phoned in his lines here. Or at least it was on purpose for us to believe he was faking it all along. I'm not sure how interesting it could be really. Twilight is essentially a story about a bad relationship.Ah I'm giving it far to much credit already. in the end it's completely harmless. There's no mystery why the core story is so attractive for those seeking romantic escapism.

soap opera remake - beautiful actors and ugly script,"Be Warned: This is coming from a girl in her 20s who has never read the Twilight saga. But I do enjoy a good vampire film/series.After all the media surrounding Twilight I expected a decent film but I found Twilight to lack the luster and buzz of recent media. I love the concept behind the novel but the execution was horrendous. Emulating an episode of Passions, the film is filled with above-average looking actors and a poorly written script. Apparently the script was written in 6 weeks and it shows. As a vampire film, it was hard to concentrate on the fantasy aspect because the special effects were laughable. And when I say ""laughable"" I mean I actually laughed out loud a few times.The film is over 2 hours long and 30 minutes in I was already checking my clock. The only thing keeping the audience (girls) in their seats was Edward, played by Robert Pattinson. I admit he is eye candy but I'd rather watch him as Cedric Diggory in Harry Potter because at least that film is watchable. The actor's performances carry the film especially the actors playing the 2 leads. They do their best with the horrible script they're given. Also, I found the actress playing Alice to do a very nice job as well.The story revolves around Bella and Edward's love story but one second their eyes meet and two seconds later she claims she loves him. The film doesn't develop their story so it's difficult to believe their love for one another. I'm sure the novel explains it in a more believable manner which is why this film may be geared more towards those loyal readers.If you plan on watching the film, I recommend reading the novel first. That way you can visualize the story and ignore the poor script development and odd film choices. There's going to be a sequel so I hope they hire a new scriptwriter and director.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Obsessed with Isabella Swan......,"This is for all, those who did not read the book, and those who apprehend the talent of Kristen Stewart.........First time when I saw the movie, I had no idea that it is based on some famous book. I saw it as one of my friend asked me to do so. I don't know if the book was better or not, but I swear, I did find the movie perfect. And by the way, how can you compare, from every point, a movie with a book?The beginning was fantastic. The first half will completely get you on the character and plot. I never saw such a brilliant use of songs in a movie before. The track 'The full moon' by The Black Ghost, which opens the movie will do get you interested about the new journey of the Bella. No parts of the movie will make you feel that anything is shown in extreme. But, as the movie had a very simple story, it could not go critical (perhaps that was a plus point) and ended predictably.I don't know why I watched this movie many many times.12/10 in acting! The role of Isabella and Edward played by Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson is priceless.Isabella Swan is little insecure, clumsy and introvert in nature. She always has complex thing going in her mind. All these things shown by Kristen is so perfect. The acting was so deep that it can get you obsessed with Bella. I think this is the height of acting: to make someone to have a crush and obsession with a character. Kristen, now in 19, has already shown her talent. No other actress have got such stardom in this young age. I think that one day she will be considered as one of the best actress in the history of Hollywood, and I know, that day is not very far.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
hope for new moon??,"i have heard twilight is better on the second viewing so i really hope the movie grows on me. i loved the series and i am glad summit got the green light for new moon. however, i wish there was a way to make up for the lack of character development and buildup for the romance that twilight was missing. the heart of twilight is the difficult love story. there just wasn't enough tension and yearning leading to the connection. it was all very rushed. also, fans do not only care about bella and edward, they love all of the characters. too much time was spent on extra scenes leading up to the arrival of the nomads who upon arrival, didn't even get enough attention.i know it's nearly impossible to fit everything in, but part of why vampire lit is so appealing to moviegoers is they are either very scary or so much cooler than humans. so much more could have been done to convert nonreaders or skeptics who think this is just a silly series for teenage girls.meyer's vampires are especially different and interesting. more needs to be done to highlight what makes them special. for example jasper's talent wasn't even mentioned and edward's mind reading was sort of ignored, when throughout the book, this was interesting and often humorous. i will say that i enjoyed the added scene of the cullens cooking dinner for bella. that was great, however, i hope that in new moon they stick to the book, the key points, and get to the heart of what the fans love...the love story and the characters.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Always love Twilight even if it wasn't a 10,"...

Yes i Know it was geared toward that tween age group but foolish for them to think only tweens were in love with Twilight.. I am in my twenty's and i expected more as a twilight obsesser i want to love it but it just wasn't there... If you didn't read the book i cant see someone appreciating it simply because its a twilight thing :) Well i think part problem is the director..bad translation...and Some bad acting! Still loved Edward n Bella's interaction if New Moon turns out like this ill be sleeping when Edwards away... Edward made the movie.. Was hoping for more Still left with a smile and thought it was cute but it should have dazzled me to the point of no compare... Im scared that New Moon Might not do as good because it wont draw out the non-readers, ratings might be a slump because there probably not twilighters!

Awful!,"First of all, I love all 4 books and really wanted to like this movie. I went in with low expectations because the previews didn't make it look that great - but I was surprised that it was even worse than I thought it was going to be!The only thing I liked about the movie is that the characters look like I thought they were supposed to when I read about them. And I liked the Cullen family - all except Edward. In the books, Edward is the most romantic guy you could ever dream of. But in the movie, he is just whiny and awkward. It reminded me of Hayden Christenson's butchering of Anniken Skywalker in the Star Wars movies. Robert Pattison is nice to look at, but his acting is terrible! And Kristen Stewart is not much better.I think the thing that was the worst for me when watching this movie, is knowing how the romance is supposed to play out, and instead I found myself thinking ""why do they even like each other?"" There is nothing really remarkable or special about the movie Edward or Bella. They are both very wooden and one dimensional. The scenes in the book that show how they fall in love and the intense passion they have for each other are all kind of jumbled into one really choppy, uncomfortable scene.When reading the book, the thing that really moves the story along is the characters - which makes for kind of a boring movie - so I knew that they were going to have to change some things around to make it more movie friendly. But the stuff that was changed didn't really add anything to the story, and the character development was totally lost in transition.All in all, this movie was unwatchable, even for people who haven't read the books. It's super boring and the acting is bad. I actually had to re-read the book so that I could remember how Edward and Bella's story is supposed to be and try to forget I ever saw the movie as it nearly ruined the whole series for me.

Words can't describe how bad this movie is.,"I am an 18 year old girl so unfortunately I am stuck with a lot of people who are obsessed with this silly little Twilight thing. After attempting to read the book (and giving up halfway through over how poorly written and plagiarised the story is) I thought maybe I'd give the film a try hoping it would be better. Now I have never walked out of a movie before but I discarded my popcorn and stormed out of the cinema in disgust after half an hour.Not only does this completely take a huge dump all over everything that is cool about vampires but it has practically destroyed the lives of the actors. If only somebody had told them what they were getting into before they signed up to be in this film. Both Robert Pattinson & Kristen Stewart have been repeatedly harassed by the idiotic and overly annoying behaviour of the stupid fans. I genuinely pity anybody involved in this movie. I pity even more those who enjoyed it. If you enjoyed this movie/book, you obviously have no idea what good literature or good film-making is and are seriously deprived.As a My Chemical Romance fan, I am thoroughly insulted by the fact that Stephenie Meyer says she was inspired by them. So as you can imagine, I practically had orgasms out of joy when MCR turned down the 'opportunity' to record the theme for New Moon.

criminal,After spending two hours of my life that will never get back I can honestly say that what has been done by the creators of this movie to a very enjoyable book is nothing short of a crime. With all the technology and good examples out there for making a good fantasy film it is hard to believe how poorly this movie was made. It was filmed like a reality show combined with shots out of a CK commercial. I would have to say that the worst part of this transformation from book to movie is how the dialog from the book which was clever and witty turned into unsophisticated sad blurted out sentences. Not to mention the well built characters that sadly transformed by poor acting and poor direction into paper cutouts of their original form.

"Bland and surprisingly lacking in passion, excitement or breathlessness","There is no point in pretending it ‚Äì I'm a man in his thirties and I'm not target audience for this film. So the fact that I rented it is just a ""bonus"" few pounds in the pockets of the makers since they clearly weren't aiming this film at me. Who they were aiming it at appears to have been the army of teenage girls who have been reading the Twilight books religiously ‚Äì again. I'd never even heard of the books so this is really something off my cultural radar. Regardless I decided to give the film a try without really knowing the plot or what it was meant to be. What I found was the first part in a longer story about a human teenager who moves back to her small town and falls for a boy who turns out to be one of a group of teenage vampires who feed off the blood of animals rather than people.I have no problems with the teenage aspect of the story but somehow it really failed to engage me as it was not only too superficial but didn't even really do that particularly well. The film plays like it has been written around events without a great deal of depth, complexity or characterisation in it, which is a surprise considering the fertile ground the world of teenage love and acceptance is. Sadly it comes off all too bland and obvious for my tastes and I rarely could bring myself to care about what was going on. The direction is a bit too serious at times but it also lacks passion and the breathlessness that the material suggests it must have once had if it did captivate a teenage audience. Of course I could be just missing the point because perhaps the cast are a big part of it working and this is lost on me.Certainly the appeal of much of the cast is lost on me totally. Stewart has something about her but cannot translate it into something meaningful here, leaving her character feeling a bit one-dimensional. However compared to Pattinson she looks like one of the finest actresses of her generation because he is about as dull and vapid as he could have been without trying. OK maybe his immortal, unsleeping character has to have something weirdly ""dead"" about him but this should not be a detrimental part of his performance as it is here. I shan't bother to list those below them because nobody really captured my interest in terms of their characters or performances.Twilight is not a bad film, it is just a very bland one that lacks passion, heart or excitement. Maybe the target audience will strongly disagree (I'd be shocked if they did not) but having watched this for myself I fail to see what not only the fuss is about ‚Äì but why anyone would really consider this to be a good film.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Twilight,"Although definitely low budget, I felt they picked the right actors (a few choices I might have made differently). The problem was not with the actors but with the script and direction. Some might say the acting was bad but keep in mind they did what the script and director said. The script added unnecessary scenes and deleted/edited a few integral scenes. The worst part was that the script wrote out Edward's lighter side and his humor making him intensely serious. If you've read the books you'll enjoy the movie just because it is, but will be disappointed with how it was done. If you haven't read the books... well it's better to read the books or else you might end up wondering ""why?"". Overall I'd say I felt mediocre about the film excited for it's release and slightly disappointed with the result. Correct actors who did a decent job with the script and direction they had. Here's hoping ""New Moon"" sticks closer to the book and has a higher budget, a new script writer and a different director wouldn't hurt.

"Not a terrible movie but all means, but not exactly my cup of tea","I didn't think Twilight was a terrible movie as such, but it is not a fantastic one either. I will admit it wasn't my cup of tea, hence my mixed score, but there are redeeming qualities. I haven't read the book, so I can't judge its faithfulness or lack of to the text. I am going to start with the negatives. The dialogue felt very clunky and awkward, and I honestly felt the actors didn't have that much to work with. The plot takes a very long time to get going, and while it gets going, there were parts that felt underdeveloped sadly. And there were a number of bits towards the beginning that were unintentionally funny, and I think that was to do with Robert Pattinson. He is a real heart-throb I know, but his acting came across as rather hammy and even overdone. When me, my family and my sister's boyfriend saw it at the cinema, there was a lot of laughter at the scenes where the character Edward Cullen was staring into the camera. However, there are some good points. Kristen Stewart does give an assured performance in the lead, and Cam Gigandet does give one of the better performances of the movie. The soundtrack was somewhat decent, the camera work was good on the most part, and the scenery was splendid. Overall, I had mixed feelings on Twilight, it wasn't bad or good, just a little on the average side. It was a vampire movie but without the bite. 5/10 Bethany Cox",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

But the movies just sucked the big peckers.The film follows the novel in all the wrong ways. Adds completely unnecessary scenes, and doesn't make use of the plot as much as it could have. Plus its just so pathetic and silly it almost makes you wanna laugh. A girl found out that she's been hanging with a vampire, and she doesn't get scared or anything. COME ON! Who would be cool after realizing you were just with a freaking vampire! Thats so freaking dumb. Give me a break! Plus, did someone think the vampires weren't gay enough? Whose bright idea was it for them to sparkle? Vampires do not sparkle, no matter what you do to these!The actors overdo it, and put way too much work into pulling off their characters. When Edward leaves the classroom after first meeting Bella, he looks like he's gotta take a crap. The performances are just too shaggy. Their not calm at all.I could go on forever, but I think iv'e covered enough. In short terms, this movie blows the big wiener. Anybody else would agree with me. Only gays and lovers of vampires would love this, and thats their problem. Don't let it be mine.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Bad Movie?,"This is more of a comment on the previous comment -- I had not read the books when I saw the movie, but I enjoyed the movie enough that I am now on book #4... I disagree with a few things previously stated. First of all, the vampires in the books do not have fangs. There is one instance where Jacob asks Bella if Edward's fangs bother her, and she gets defensive and says ""You know he doesn't have fangs!"" It's pretty hard to turn a 300+ page book into a less than 2-hour PG-13 movie without leaving out some of the detail, especially when the detail is usually about how beautiful the characters are. The only way to really show that is through makeup and the way other people look at those characters... In my opinion, the movie was done just fine, and considering a lot of twilight fans have paid to see it multiple times, I don't think it was ""by far... the worst."" Have you seen ""The Spirit"" yet? :) I rest my case.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Worst. Movie. Ever.,"This is so bad it could be a cult classic. Stewart is the absolute worst actress. She thinks acting is head shaking, lip biting, stuttering, and blinking excessively. It's impossible not to see it then you can't unsee it. How is she an ""actress"" that makes money? Watching this was physically painful. The story was inane and the acting is pitifully poor. I don't get how this is supposed to be someone's version of romantic or entertaining. Mega stupid and so gross.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Looking Forward,"Twilight was a very entertaining movie, yes, I am very critical with movies, and don't get to see as many movies as id like, yet I have seen twilight 3 times. The problems with Twilight were Film School project mistakes, Its almost as if they just got lazy, between the editing, or the special effects, down to the casting of Edward.For starters the acting in Twilight was very commendable. Some of the most natural, realistic acting from an ensemble cast we have seen in a long time, except for Edward. I realize every one is in current Rob love but, he took the flirting romantic lines and made them creepy and awkward, to the point where you wonder why Bella is with him, Yes he has his moments but on the whole he was no Casanova.And then the ever depressing sunlight seen, where he Bella describes it as ""beautiful, like a million diamonds embedded in his skin"" and then in the movie he looks like someone dipped him in sugar. Then there is the rain scene where there drenched then they are bone dry. The fight scene where her major wounds magically heal themselves. I could note errors in the movie for hours, and don't get me wrong this movie was good the cinematography was stunning the entire film was eye candy but the mistakes were enough to draw my attention from the story and notice them.This Series has the potential to be great They have Great Writers, A director with a good vision and a all around stellar break out cast, If they clean up there filming crew find a competent editor and a special effects crew that knows what the hell there doing New Moon will be a stellar movie!",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
This movie was a HUGE letdown!,"This movie was a HUGE letdown! The acting was forced, there is zero chemistry between Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson, and unless you've read the book you're going to be lost as to what's actually happening from scene to scene! It was almost as if they rushed making the movie just to make money off of fans running to see it. Instead, they should have taken the time to write a better script, make better CGI, get better makeup artists (you could see Robert's contact lenses and his cheeks were flushed in at least one scene!) and find a director who actually knows what the Pacific Northwest looks like (here's a hint, remove the blue tinting--or did they miss that quote from the book about how GREEN it is!)! Don't waste your money on this flop! Instead, read the book!",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Only people expecting a perfect adaptation will be disappointed...,"It had always bugged me (hearing people constantly complain about stuff left out/things that were changed in movie adaptations of books). I'd never read any books that films had been based on, and therefore was able to enjoy the films for what they were, rather than comparing them to the books they were adapted from. With the Twilight series, however, I finally decided that I wanted to see things from a different angle. I wanted to read these novels and then watch the film so that I could get a different perspective on things. I started reading the Twilight novels after hearing that a movie was being made based on the first one. Although I'd heard it was a series targeted at girls, I thought the books were worth giving a shot and went into it with an open mind. I actually really enjoyed them and couldn't put them down, they were that good. As for the movie...Bella & Edward - I can happily, and with all certainty, assure people that Kristen Stewart has been perfectly cast as Bella. They could not have found a better fit. She embodies the character completely and absolutely does her justice. Robert Pattison's Edward is suitably cold in the beginning, but soon warms up and you can tell these two actors have the chemistry needed to make the Bella and Edward relationship believable. Although they are given questionable dialogue at times, they both pull out all the stops - and thank heavens, as this film rests almost completely on their shoulders. That isn't to say the other characters in the film aren't important. Far from it. Every other person in the movie is crucial, and I'm glad to see the casting was spot-on with almost every single one of them.The Cullens - They are given limited screen time (some more than others), but manage to make the most of their time on screen. They're ALL good in their roles. Peter Facinelli and Nikki Reed (as Carlisle and Rosalie) are probably given the best chance to develop their characters, whilst Emmett, Jasper and Esme are sadly underused. I was annoyed with how briefly Alice was on screen (she was my favourite character from the books and Ashley Greene was another superbly cast actress. What little we saw of her, however, was spot-on. She *is* Alice).Mike Newton, Jessica Stanley, Eric Yorkie, Angela Weber - The actors playing Bella's ""friends"" (I use the term loosely, because she doesn't exactly treat them as such) are given a surprisingly solid amount of screen time to develop their characters. They all manage to define themselves within mere moments of Bella meeting them (Anna Kendrick as Jessica probably being the stand-out of the lot). They provide some of the film's funnier moments.Charlie and Renee - Billy Burke and Sarah Clarke (as Bella's parents) are both memorable, given their limited screen time. The awkwardness between father and daughter is something that's stayed faithful to the book. So has the mother/daughter relationship. Billy Burke is especially good as Charlie (he provides some amusing moments).Jacob Black - Sadly, like quite a few other important characters in the movie, Jacob's underused and we don't really get to know him as well as we should. Taylor Lauter does the best he can, though. He shows promise. Jacob's father (Billy) has even less time, but still gets a couple of laughs.James, Victoria and Laurent - Although Cam Gigandet is somewhat over-the-top as James, Rachelle Lefevre's Victoria has the quiet menacing thing down.Directing - Catherine Hardwicke makes the movie visually interesting. She has a very distinct style, which I think the film benefits from. Hardwicke's directing keeps the film grounded, and it has a 'realism' about it (which is quite the feat, considering). The scenery/atmosphere is amazing and the *look* of things is very faithful to the book. There's an incredible amount of thought and detail that's gone into the movie. The film's soundtrack is used exceptionally well. It never feels intrusive, but is just there in the background to enhance things (in a subtle way). The visually-stunning baseball scene is a perfect example of this. It's one of the best parts of the film. I also liked the wide sweeping shots of Bella and Edward high up in the trees (where 'Bella's Lullaby' was used to great effect).If I had to pick one negative, it would be that the film feels a tad rushed. It felt as though there was SO much to get through, and certain things/characters weren't lingered on long enough. But this is a minor quibble. What's most important is that the heart of the books is maintained, and I believe the film has achieved this. Twilight isn't full of CGI, which makes it a better film. It's much more subtle/serious (though there's still plenty of humour, as well as some action. The film's humour was actually something I really enjoyed). Twilight may not be totally perfect/flawless, but I think it comes pretty close and remains very true to the books. Overall, I think this movie is successful at translating the first of Stephenie Meyer's books to screen. It's very enjoyable (I saw it twice at the cinema) and I cannot wait for New Moon. Make sure to stay for the end credits, they're well worth watching.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"It was O.K., rushed/thin plot.","I took my girlfriend to see this movie, because she is a huge fan of the novel. She told me the movie was pretty close to the actual book, but I could not help feeling that the acting coming from a few of the main actors was just lazy. The guy that played Edward did a great job in my opinion. His acting seemed to be the only bit that had any effort put into it. Oh well. girlfriend was happy in the, which means that I am happy. I would say it is bearable if any other guys out there are considering taking their girlfriends as well. Action sequences were nice, but to short. But in the end as I said before, everything felt rushed. At one point it kinda makes sense, then if feels like what should have taken 45 minutes to occur in the movie only took 35 seconds. Other than that, just expect decent acting from most of the characters, and a thin plot. Everything else is fine though. Hope this helps!",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Just...not that good...at all.,"'Twilight' had potential. Harry Potter proved that successful book to movie adaptations could be done. I mean, as a huge fan of Harry Potter, I was very pleased with at least 3 of the 5 movies.However, Twilight just fails. I am not that big of a fan of a book, I actually read it just because I wanted to see what the big deal was. I wasn't blown away at all, but it was fine, and I suppose I can figure why every female I know is nuts for it.But again, the movie fails to do the book any justice. It isn't really a mess up by anyone in particular. Just the overall effort to make it an adequate adaptation seemed to be seriously lacking. It almost felt as if they were rushing to get it made. Some of the lines are just terrible. I never thought the actual writing of the book was that sophisticated, but the screenplay just takes the already corny lines and butchers them that much more.If you are a fan of the book, avoid. If you want to see a movie for the sole purpose of making fun of it, go for it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"Big Anticipation, Big Disappointment...","The movie we have been anticipating all year has finally come out! Sadly... it felt rushed and left the viewer sort of unfulfilled. Granted, compared to Eragon in its book vs movie comparison, Twilight did bring much of the book onto the big screen. The actors were... Dull, boring, and monotonous. Stewert, while being in some good movies, just does not get the emotions out. Robert did an excellent job of Edward, but the movie, like the book, focused WAY too much on him. Most of the movie focuses on the two main characters, while this is expected, the others are sort of ""not as involved"". Some of the characters were very dull and you learn so little about anything. Had I not read the book first, I would have been VERY confused with this movie. In some areas, the characters have awkward moments(in fact too many) that left me seeing this movie as a corny and bad impression of some of Twilight's more dramatic moments. All in all, this movie was one of the biggest letdowns, that will only draw in profit from the inflated hype blimp created by the fans. If your a die hard fan, you will be disappointed, otherwise I recommend reading the book, before seeing the movie, otherwise you just won't get half of what is going on.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Lets hope New Moon will be a little bit better...,"I wasn't really sure I was going to go for the ""glittering vampire love story"" that every tween in America has been screeching about, I mean really? Vampires that glitter? But I gave the books a shot and found them to be very delightful.I would say the movie was... delightfully terrible and unintentionally funny. I found myself giggling at the acting and the over dramatic scenes that you are frequently presented with. It's almost kind of tragic. But that's mostly the beginning of the movie. The actors seem a little more tense, the makeup is a little over done, and there are many scenes that are supposed to be really serious dramatic moments, and you don't seem to be able to point out as much during the end of the movie. It's like the actors did this in one long take, you can tell that they're more comfortable in the last half of the movie, and the makeup isn't so annoying and obvious.It's fun to see the characters they picked and the way they played out the book. There are many scenes that are tweaked from the book that honestly would've been better off keeping it the same. Sometimes while Edward is running around or whatever, you can get the feel of the big string pulling him around, but hey, that's low budget for ya. But overall, it's fun to watch it if you're a Twilight lover, which I am. I would probably see this movie again, but I still cannot entirely take it serious, and I really hope that New Moon will do a better job considering how much money they made on Twilight alone!",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Did i just pay to see this?,"Let me start by saying that I'm a fan of all the books in this series and a fan of movies in general.It doesn't take very long for all the hopes you had for this film to be tossed away.Its obvious that Catherine Hardwicke was in over her head with this one. The Film tries to stay true to the book, but it all takes place to fast at an awkward pace. There is almost zero character development and in the end your left asking "" what""? In all fairness most movies don't stay to close to the book so this was to be expected.Most shocking was the horrible acting and all the unneeded close ups. I felt more like i was watching a Episode of something on BBC rather than a Hollywood movie.The make up and special effects were laughable at best. Apparently all you have to do to be a vampire is spray baby powder on yourself.In closing. Save your money, Enjoy the book and pass on this film its a train wreck.

If only I could create something so 'terrible',"This franchise has made almost everyone who touches it very rich. And what is rare success is that the popularity has only increased with each movie.

A Bad but (somehow) Charming Film,"First of all, I haven't read the books and never would have watched this again if it weren't for my girlfriend being a fan. Second, going into the film after not watching it for eight years, my expectations were warped by the fact that the entire world is split into two distinct camps: those who praise 'Twilight' as the greatest thing ever produced by mankind, and those who think it's the epitome of horrendous cinema. For me, this is a bad film that's nonetheless entertaining for most of its runtime; I can see why it's a lot of people hold it as a 'guilty pleasure'.So yeah, 'Twilight' is a bad film - but that isn't to say it's not entertaining. The acting is mostly bad and the script is mostly awful, so every character interaction comes across as incredibly awkward, forced, and plastic. The movie is hilariously cheesy with its disposable and lifeless narration, its ridiculous vampire special effects, its bizarre plot, and all the rest of it; a lot of the time it feels like I'm watching a high schooler's project. For me, the plot falls apart in the third act. I understand there is a series of source material to follow, but when looking at this film as it's own story, it didn't have to end in some low-stakes, black and white, good vs. Evil climax. The villain is boring and useless, and the movie falls flat on its face for its final act. And admittedly, while there's cute parts, the central romance is never really established, and I found most initial interactions between the two leads to be pretty lacklustre.While I do think it's a bad film, I think it gets an undeserved reputation, because it's not awful. Despite its many flaws I still found it a lot of fun to watch with my girlfriend. And it's not just so bad that it's good - there are genuinely good (if a little mindless) aspects to it. It's hard to pinpoint but the movie has a unique atmosphere and charm about it that I found attractive; it's not ashamed of embracing its quirks and strange world to tell its tale. A lot of it is silly but fun, like the whole development of the romance, which is underdeveloped but somehow pretty cute; Edward and Bella rocking up all cool to school in their fresh relationship; or the dramatic conversation between Edward and Bella when it's revealed he's a vampire. And honestly, there are some compelling, character-driven parts to it too, that might not be executed perfectly but are nonetheless quite nice (Bella's 'betrayal' of her father comes to mind as an emotional moment, though it's weight is nonexistent later on). A lot of what I like are concepts that aren't entirely explored or executed.So all in all, it's a bad film that I enjoyed a lot for the most part. Just turn off your brain, get a friend to watch it with, and embrace all its quirks, faults, and cheesiness. It's a very understandable guilty pleasure.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
OC meets Buffy,"This phenomenon that calls itself Twilight hit me completely unexpected. So unexpected, that when I actually saw the movie, I wasn't entirely sure, if the source novel/book, was written many years ago or not that long ago ... The latter was true which just confirmed my first thought after watching it. And my thought was my summary line. That could have been the pitch ... or should have been!While I don't see entirely the attraction on Robert Pattinson (and/or his character), he is quite different, than ... let's say other characters. It's amazing what you will read about the movie, which can spoil quite a bit. There is another major character here, who only plays a small role in this one. But if you watch the movie, you know pretty much, what this character is going to evolve to (literally) in the future installments of the series.While the adults bring some nice flavor to the whole thing, you could wonder why there are only beautiful people on screen. But that wouldn't do this movie justice. It is targeted at teen girls (well girls/women in general) and fully achieves it's goal(s). So while some men will be bitter about this movie (experience), their (girl-)friends will love it. I know because I watched it with my niece(on DVD). And she went out and bought the books!

Very awful beginning to one of the worst franchises ever,"I had never been interested to the TWILIGHT franchise despite it was very popular when it came out. However during the first lockdown at the beginning of the pandemic they aired them on TV and since we had to stay home, I finally forced myself to watch them. Now that I took this off my chest I can go to the review.When the story begins, Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) has recenlty moved from Phoenix to Forks in Washington for staying with her police chief dad. She gets re-acquainted with American Native Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) who was a childhood friends of her and she goes to a new high college in the hope of making friends. Bella is intrigued by the Cullen sibilings (Robert Pattinson and Peter Facinelli) and after Edward saves her from a bus who was going to hit her she notices he has supernatural powers like that of a vampire. Edward confirms this and also that they only feed on animal blood. They fall in love despite the Cullen's family is afraid that their secret will go exposed and three nomadic vampires (James, Victoria and Laurent) who are responsible for some deaths that look like animal attacks. James tries to inject venom in Bella's blood but Edward saves her just in time for the prom.To say this film is bad is an understatement. The acting is mostly lazy, with Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart that almost always have the same expressions. Taylor Lautner and most of the other vampires don't do nothing more than smile or staying around the scenery. The action sequences are very lazy, with special effects that look dated even for 2008 standards. The rest is quite forgettable.Overall, a movie that truly stands to its notorious reputation. And here is the main problem; is not even that funny as a bad movie but very boring.

Do NOT watch the movie if you haven't read the book!,"I am in love with the twilight series, especially the first book. And mainly because of how much i love Edward. Hes the perfect guy. SO what if he happens to be a vampire? SOoooooooo I saw the movie and i definitely enjoyed watching it cuz its like a summary of the book that u get to see and kinda relive reading it, but it doesn't compare one bit. I mean, first off, that was the worst actor to play Edward. He was not a good actor, he sounded like he was reading from the script the whole time. And, I picture Edward to be tough and protective and just so sweet, and this guy, i don't know, just didn't portray it that way. Sure he can stop a truck and do all the Edward in the book things, but it looked so fake cuz he was such a skinny dork. And again a really bad actor. In my opinion. The Bella actress was pretty good, but i think he ruined the scenes so much that no actress could recover th magic that i picture them having between them. And since the movie is so much shorter they rush the whole relationship with Edward and Bella that u cant fully appreciate the chemistry between them like in the book. So, what i have been telling everyone is they can not see the movie before they read the book. If u do, u cant fully appreciate it and u will think that it really is nothing special and there is no point to read the book.

The set-up of the meeting between Bella and Edward was not dramatic at all and should been.

Not the best vampire movie,"Well, maybe my comment will disappoint a lot of Twilight fans, but I really didn't like that movie.

I've never seen a movie with so barren Scenario. Perhaps that's the worst part, cause that makes everything look very premature. Book contains a lot of quite important trifles and here it was changed (I didn't like the way how they did it) or wasn't at all. Director (C.Hardwicke) just wanted to show us the Twilight story largely, but I missed those little important things.

Not As Bad As It Could Have Been,"Let me say first, while I enjoyed the books, I am not an over-obsessed fan-girl. They were entertaining, and of the four the first one was my favorite.Going into this movie, I had some very low expectations. The trailers had disappointed me, and I was concerned about some of the actors. Thankfully, I was proved mostly wrong.The good news first: they stayed true to the book. They didn't go all crazy or huge blockbuster, and in doing so loose the plot. I was pleasantly surprised by most of the actors, especially Robert Pattinson. I think he did a decent job of playing Edward. He pulled off the restrained parts, and was just emotional enough to be believable in the tenser parts. We didn't see much of Taylor Lautner as Jacob in this one, but the scenes he was in he did well in.Unfortunately, where there is good there is also bad, and there is one glaring error the filmmakers made in creating this film: casting Kristen Stewart as Bella. Some of you will probably say that I'm only saying that because I wish I was Bella. I don't. Team Jacob all the way here. Anyways, she lacks the emotion required for many of the scenes, and she has the exact same look on her face for the entire film. I was very disappointed by her performance.So, overall, a surprisingly good film, with the potential to be an 8 or 9 if you can cut Kristen Stewart out of the role of Bella.

It keeps the same feeling of the story, the general idea that got people excited in the first place.Only a couple of things annoyed me, the special effects were a bit over the top. A couple of cringes here and there, but apart from that,I really loved this movie, and I look forward to the sequel next year.

This movie is absolutely horrible,"First off, I have to admit that I was not able to make it all the way through the movie without using the fast-forward button. 45 minutes into the movie, the characters were completely undeveloped, and the storyline was not gripping, entertaining, or even vaguely interesting. Perhaps if I was a freshman girl in high-school, I could have identified with the main character better, but I'm not, so I was extremely bored and now irritated that I was watching the movie. The first part of this grade is based on it being a bad movie. Horrible effects, sub-par acting, and a yawner of a story.However, it gets worse. This story involves vampires, but does not follow any of the accepted stereotypes of vampiric lore. If you are familiar with anything written by Bram Stoker or Anne Rice, this movie will seriously make you want to bite someone in the jugular. Possibly even inflict bodily harm on yourself. Count Chockula makes a more convincing vampire than any of the vampires depicted in this film.Bottom line: This movie is a shining beacon for the demise of modern-day cinema.

Still my overall impression was that something at the center went missing.First, deprived of Bella's inner dialogue and her lightness & humor, the first half of the movie felt tentative. We sense what's going on with Bella but as viewers we are on the outside. We need direction. What drives the book is Bella's quirky humor and her ever escalating fixation with Edward. According to the story on the second day of school she is stricken with disappointment; Edward is absent. Even to her this is mysterious. With little encouragement from Edward, Bella becomes enthralled - nay, devoted to being by his side. Obsession culminates with her risky venture into the isolated meadow, alone with a superhuman killer. In the film this story arc is abbreviated and oddly spliced-up. The story feels a little thin. (Plus the voice of Edward, as played by Robert Pattinson, was a little startling, and not in a good way, and took some getting used to).Secondly, the movie introduces a catalog of elements and characters from the book plus some added violence but less romance. (Same thing happened with the adaptation of Brokeback Mountain ¬ña far, far superior story and film, I know.) The primary story, the intense, scintillating and overwhelming perhaps fatal attraction of the two leads, is diluted. The movie is less sensual than the book. Wasn't there time for any over-the-top, big screen caliber romance? Instead some favorite scenes and dialogue went missing. (""You're intoxicated by my very presence"") The overall effect is an enjoyable glimpse of many supporting story elements and an odd romance that feels too underdeveloped to be the force driving all the action. I suspect the scriptwriter tried a little too hard to dial down the passion appropriately for her intended adolescent audience. Where's the fun in that? Plus it made for an uneven movie.Mysteriously, all the talent at work on this film couldn't dispel a TV movie-of-the-week sensibility. This distracted me for the first half of the movie. Why did the story come across so small? Maybe the movie didn't know what kind of tone it wanted to take. Lots of possibilities were on option in this chock-full story.For the rest, I enjoyed myself. Plenty of talent in evidence. The actors did remarkably well. The tension, humor and yes, the tenderness of some of their scenes made for quality low-key stuff. I loved the setting, the adolescent angst, the actor who plays Charlie, the few extreme close-ups, the dream (or were they?) sequences. The parts just didn't quite add-up to a satisfying adaptation or night out at the movies. I can attest the movie improves upon second viewing :)",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
I don't understand what's going on whit the teenagers nowadays,"I went to watch this movie because i was late and was the only one with places. Is the worst teenage movie i've ever seen, i don't have read the books and i will never do, because certainly is a completely stupidness like the movie, the dialogs are the most lame thing that i've ever heard; visually, there is nothing exciting or stunning which made the grade to be screened on cinema, only that few scenes at the top of the trees. I don't understand what's going on with the kids, how can such a stupid drama be such a best seller??? I'm afraid for the future of the human race if the young people continues reading and consuming so stupid stories. Where are the clever ones? I'm not a big fan of vampires or alike, but i can recognize a good story and a movie well done and Twilight doesn't have none of that. Movie stinks, story sucks, the screenplay is boring. This movie shouldn't be at the theaters, it should be in a VHS tape amongst the worst B movies of the life.

When a bad book becomes a movie,"Well, when a friend of mine told me about the movie i was into going to see it, vampires, pretty cool ah? But no, It was so bad, so bad, it even hurted. Vampires that glow in sun light, and are vegetarian (they eat animals, i though vegetarians eat vegetables but the author doesn't think so) and a love story between a ugly emo girl and a homosexual vampire. Everything in the movie was so bad i even felt bad for the people that actually liked it. After someone showed me fractions of the book i understood why the movie was to bad, cause the book is even worst (or not). made to please little virgin girls that are in love with weird girlie boys, this book and movie really diminishes your IQ when your exposed to them, it's a scientific fact.

Am I Missing A Joke?,"I'm beginning to think that the majority of teenage girls are attracted to sappy story lines, idealistic lifestyles, and fantasy lovers. Bella Swan is an average looking girl who moves to Forks and meets Edward Cullen, absolutely the perfect male. The books couldn't go one sentence without describing how pretty this boy is, let alone a paragraph without mentioning that Bella is liked by about four boys at once and still claims to be an average looking teenager. The movies, at least, have got this right. Kristen Stewart is strikingly homely and, along with Robert Pattinson, a very attractive young actor, the two make the ideal couple. How quaint.So, this dream-guy, he mets Bella Swan (Translated to meaning 'beautiful', 'graceful'. COMPLETELY average, right?) and the two are instantly in love. The movie displays this quick affection in what seems to be a matter of days. Besides the clich√© plot, the Romeo and Juilet story line, and having to deal with Stephanie Meyer calling herself the modern day Shakespeare, it's the bad acting you have to put up with. This is mainly due to Kristen Stewart's horrible ability, not Pattinson's. She spends most of the film making a face as if she's sucked a lemon dry, and talks in the deepest voice ever heard. Why is this girl an actor?So, it didn't help that I think the books are a slap in the face to literature. It doesn't help that I couldn't stand in a room with Stephanie Meyer or Kristen Stewart. It also doesn't help that I prefer good writing, a good plot, and good actors. But, if you're going to go see Twilight, bring your iPod.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Varieties of vampire experience,"Say you're feeling like a misfit in school; how about finding a vampire to be your boyfriend or girlfriend? Vampires, after all, are misfits too--big time--but their alienation is offset by special powers you lack, such as superhuman strength and the ability to live for centuries. A friend like that sets you apart from the crowd. The rich possibilities of teenage vampire romance are illustrated by two new movies, 'Twilight' and 'Let the Right One In.' Different as they are, they satisfy similar adolescent fantasies. Maybe for different adolescents.'Twilight,' directed by Catherine Hardwicke, of 'Thirteen' and 'Lords of Dogtown,' is a story primarily for teenage girls. It's based on the first of Stephanie Meyer's bestsellers about the relationship that develops at a Washington State high school between a new girl in the junior class named Bella (Kristen Stewart) and, as the high girls unnecessarily spell it out to Bella, ""totally gorgeous"" undead teenager Edward Cullen. He's a student; so are several of his siblings. Of course the other students don't know the Cullens are vampires; it is left to Bella make the discovery after she and Edward fall for each other. Young female readers of the books have been suggesting their various ""perfect"" candidates to play the role of this heartthrob (see YouTube)--Hayden Christensen, Gaspard Uliiel and Josh Hartnett were favorites--but the choice for the movie has fallen on Robert Pattinson. Meyer has published three sequels, so if the movie opener does well this could be a franchise on the order of Harry Potter.'Twilight' glamorizes and softens vampire-hood and makes it upper middle class. Edward's foster father's the Washington State town's main doctor. The family drives cool late-model cars and lives in a splendid airy pad up in the misty hills. None of the old lugubrious Addams Family heavy-curtained look. The Cullens are hip, PC vampires. When Edward tells Bella about himself, he explains they're ""like vegetarians,"" abstaining (though with difficulty) from human blood and living instead off deer from the woods. They like the Pacific Northwest because of all the rain--the perpetual ""twilight""--but it's not because sunshine will make them burst into flames, only that it makes them glow with a diamond-like digitalized surface on their skin that will reveal them to be ""different."" Edward shows Bella when they're up in the woods. Their relationship is chaste--perhaps to avoid the danger of Edward's inadvertently pouncing on Bella and biting her neck. They don't even kiss on the mouth till the end. Edward's concerned because he doesn't want to get involved with Bella--it could cause them both a world of harm (like premarital intercourse?).The prim, nobly suffering Edward is like a superhero, a pale, romantically high-cheek-boned version of a blockbuster clich√©. He can jump across a parking lot to stop a skidding SUV from injuring Bella. In one of the movie's most whimsical sequences, he takes Bella flying up in the trees near his family's house to admire the river and the mist. Trouble comes when it turns a rival vampire family of the old-fashioned homicidal kind has invaded the region.Bella has all kinds of conflicts--and Kristen Stewart is reasonably good at making them seem real. She's left her remarried mother in Arizona and gone back to live with dad, Forks, WA's lonely, rather boring town sheriff. Her regular human classmates are that he is, doesn't want Bella to get involved with him. But in a cliff-hanger at the film's end, she begs him to ""turn"" her, and he refuses--at the high school prom! This is glossy, somehow conventional and kitschy stuff, with clunky characterization and some blatant makeup. Why the Cullens need to play baseball (at superhuman speed) in a thunderstorm is never explained. And the fudging on classic rules of vampire-hood seems unjustified. Pattinson's wooden acting--no better than Christensen or Hartnett's would have been--is only compensated by many tight closeups of his immaculate and chiseled face. Nonetheless Twilight is still lively and fun, and not at all bad, really; Hardwicke has a good touch with young people. This is what the squealing girls wanted: a glamorization and gentrification of vampires into a boyfriend who's noble and ""different"" and cool and scary. The ""Twilight' stories are an interesting pop phenomenon that it's no use fighting.Swedish indie director Tomas Alfredson's 'Let the Right One In' is at the opposite pole. It's dark and down-and-dirty and surprisingly realistic--and at the same time more authentically strange. The supernatural effects are simple and understated. One vampire, a newly-turned who doesn't at all like who she's become, commits suicide by having her husband open the shade and let the sun in: she explodes into flames and is burnt away. Alfredson doesn't mess with or tone down the harsh rules of vampire life.'Let the Right One In' is Swedish, after all--from a country that's all twilight. This is a complex, ironic tale of a small blond 12-year-old boy names Oskar (K√•re Hedebrant) living in the outskirts of Stockholm who gets cruelly picked on by classmates and fantasizes revenge, standing in his room fondling a small dagger, as we first see him. Soon he's befriended by a mysterious new neighbor, Eli (Lina Leandersson), a lanky-haired girl who hangs around outdoors in the cold without needing a coat. She likes him, and he asks her to be his girlfriend. Over time, he realizes she's a vampire, but he doesn't care. There's nothing glamorous about Eli's life. When Oskar sees her flat, he says, ""You're like poor, right?"" Her dad is a loser and knows it. His efforts to kill people and get their blood are practical and utilitarian, but also fumbled failures. She may be able to help Oskar--and she does, both physically, at a crucial moment, and psychologically, by encouraging him to fight back. But she herself is doomed.

Why So Much Hate for Twilight?,"I don't understand the hate for Twilight. It may not be a cinematic masterpiece, but it's far from deserving the level of scorn it often receives. This is a movie that defined a generation, introducing a supernatural love story that resonated deeply with millions of fans. It blends drama, fantasy, and romance to create a unique, immersive world that's easy to get lost in.The criticisms often seem excessive or misplaced. Yes, the dialogue can be awkward, and the pacing uneven at times, but isn't that true for countless other films that don't face the same level of disdain? The world-building, on the other hand, is fascinating. Forks' gloomy atmosphere is beautifully captured, creating a moody, dreamlike setting that fits perfectly with the tone of the story.One of the film's standout features is its soundtrack, which remains one of the best of its era. Tracks from artists like Muse, Paramore, and Iron & Wine not only complement the scenes but also elevate them, adding emotional depth and intensity. It's a perfect example of how music can transform a film experience.While Twilight has its flaws, it also has its strengths. The chemistry between Bella and Edward might be divisive, but their story resonates with anyone who's ever experienced intense, all-consuming love. It's easy to forget that the series wasn't trying to appeal to film critics but to young people searching for escapism and connection, something it delivered in spades.This movie also launched a massive cultural phenomenon. Whether you loved or hated it, you can't deny its impact on pop culture. It brought vampires and werewolves back into the mainstream, spawned countless parodies, and influenced an entire genre of films and books that followed.I gave it a 9 not because it's flawless, but because I think it deserves better than the relentless negativity it receives. Twilight is clearly overhated, and its score often reflects more of a bandwagon effect than an objective assessment. Ratings should reflect the enjoyment and impact a film has, not just its technical achievements.In the end, cinema isn't just about perfection, it's about the emotions a story evokes and the memories it leaves behind. For many, Twilight is a nostalgic, guilty pleasure that holds a special place in their hearts. And honestly, isn't that the real magic of movies?",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"Just about the worst ""movie"" ever made","This movie is literally painful to watch. If you're not a 15 year old girl, preferably emo, don't waste your time ever thinking of watching this. The plot is non-existent, the acting is pitiful, and the whole picture lacks of any originality. Kristen Stewart is literally the worst actress EVER to star in a movie; she doesn't know how to portray her emotions at all, she has no control over her face, which twitches constantly. The only positives I could find, were the visual aspects of the movie, quite plausible. Other than that, I feel too generous giving this 2 stars, when it clearly deserves none.

Robert Pattinson has arrived......,"Before starting my comment I would like to say I have not read the book so am no twilight fan, hence, very little expectations. The casting was kinda OK. Robert is here to stay, perfectly cast as Edward and I know that Kirsten Stewart's character is confused, but her face emotes one expression throughout. Someone else would have done better justice to Bella's character. All other supporting characters lacked depth, but still the Cullen's did a good job. The visuals were awesome and the movie had an above average background score, especially liked the scene when Edward plays the piano. The baseball scene was fun. This is a vampire film but the action sequences, were far below average. Director, if you cant think of any new sequences, should have watched some good old vampire films to get an idea. The bad guy James look like a retard, he wont even scare my 6 yr old niece. The makeup was patchy and editing a bit too crisp for my liking. The director didn't give a chance for a scene to develop. The dialogues were as corny as it could get, especially Bella's, as if they are lifted right of the book, but what hooked me for 2 hours was the chemistry between the two actors. They looked like an item on screen. I still have not understood a few elements in this film, and that I think is because I haven't read the book.

It is somewhat worth seeing if you read the book, but I would never watch it again.

They did a good job bringing the story to the screen,"**This review may contain spoilers**I usually hate movie version of books I love. The ONLY two exceptions I can think of are ""The Shining"" and ""Jurassic Park."" Otherwise, it seems to be impossible to bring a book to the screen credibly. Twilight will be number three on my list.The screenwriter and director have done a really good job bringing difficult material to life on the big screen. All the characters and basic elements of the story have been translated beautifully. Edward's love/hate of Bella at first, before he decides to actually love her, was portrayed perfectly by Robert Pattinson. If looks could kill, his would have done so. All the other characters were spot on as well. Alice, Emmett, Jasper and Rosalie couldn't have been better portrayed if some magic had brought the actual words from the book to life! Jacob seemed a little bit polished. He never quite looked like the scruffy kid from the rez who just walked out of his garage. But he did have the warm welcoming that Jacob is supposed to have. And the three bad vampires were EXACTLY right! The movie really came to life when they were on the screen.The only two problems I had with the movie were these: Kristen Stewart's acting sometimes lacks any emotional range. Her line delivery is really choppy, and she physically seems twitchy in many scenes. But the bigger problem was the score. Music is SO important in a movie. The choice of music can completely change the tone. And the music in Twilight for the most part wasn't that good. The songs that Pattinson sang were probably the best in the film. The music behind the beloved meadow scene sounded like it had been pulled right from a B-movie based on a sappy Harlequin romance novel. The scene itself, if you could keep the music out of your mind, seemed well done. But the music sets such a B-movie tone that it makes you feel like you're watching a worse movie than you actually are. Director Catherine Hardwicke will have a bigger budget for the next movie, so I hope she hires Alan Shore, John Williams, or someone of their substantial abilities to score the next movie. She can still throw in the ""hip"" songs here and there.These problems didn't make me dislike the movie, though. I would still say go see it and have a good time",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"Not bad, but compromised by very high expectations","I have read the book. And today I watched the movie. So what do I think? They got the atmosphere of rainy and gloomy Forks, Washington right. They got the actors right, most of the time. My personal favorite actor was the guy who played Bella's dad Charlie, because he was so natural in his strained interactions with Bella. But I will complain about the ghastly overly white make-up for the vampires being too obviously make-up (especially for Dr. Carlisle Cullen).As the leads, Kirsten Stewart (as Bella) and Robert Pattinson (as Edward) have a lot of big expectations to live up too. They have got the right look, but I think the exquisite descriptions in the book made their job very difficult to pull off for the big screen. The readers have made their imaginations run wild with the vivid narrations of Ms. Meyer in her novel, so it would be difficult to satisfy everyone's own interpretation. Their interpretations may never be enough for true Twilight fans.Poor Robert Pattinson certainly has more pressure since Edward is a veritable demigod in the novel The fans have their own individual ideas on how Edward should look, talk, run, fight, glisten in the sunlight, etc. I personally felt he was too stiff in his interpretation of Edward. This maybe more of a problem with the director's vision though, rather than the actor's call. There were very awkwardly filmed scenes, like their first class together, and their first kiss.My wife watched this without reading the book yet and she generally likes it as a romance movie. It was enough to make her overlook the vampire aspect which she does not really relish. I personally felt more time could have been spent to establish the depth of their love for each other. The director chose to spend more time to establish the presence of James' group, where Laurent was unexpectedly played by a black actor. In fact, this film really takes an effort to create a multiracial casting, for which it can be commended.It is not a bad movie. It is just compromised by too much high expectations from readers of the novel who have eagerly anticipated this film treatment.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Undead Tripe - Stick to Buffy,"What's good about this film: Billy Burke's performance of Bella's Swan's Dad. There are some nice landscape shots. Bella is OK. What's bad about this film: The villains appear to be an assortment of undead retards, they maintain a constant threat level equal to cold porridge throughout the film, occasionally spouting some entirely inconsequential dialogue with pantomime-villain false bravado. Robert Pattinson may be good looking as the not-so-fangy Edward Cullen, but his performance would embarrass a four year old Shepard in a Nativity. He has clearly mastered the ""I'm awfully troubled you know/digestive difficulties are getting me cross"" cold pout, and reverts to this failsafe in almost every scene.

The First Episode Of The Saga,"This adaptation of the YA novel is a story about Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart), a young woman who moves to Forks, Washington to be with her father. He is the chief of police there. She has a quiet personality. The mood of the story is foreboding, with somber music and cloudy skies.She is befriended by a group of students. And she notices Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson), a mysterious boy who seems to be avoiding her. Their relationship will become the focus of the story. As she comes to know him, she finds he is impulsive and anguished.She also reconnects with Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner), a native American boy she had known as a young child. He knows the area well, and he answers some of her questions.""Twilight"" is a love story, in part. It is also a fantasy adventure story with an interesting mix of tones. One of the best scenes is when Edward takes her home to meet his family. It's an odd scene, but it works well, in part due to its humor.The film is just the first episode in the Twilight saga, and its ending makes that clear. The film has been massively popular. Those who take it as a serious love story may be ignoring its elements of camp.The film does not paint all adults as clueless, self-centered fools, unlike many other YA films. And it deserves credit for that. Bella's parents are nothing but loving and concerned, though they might struggle sometimes with Bella's moodiness; that just makes it even more realistic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Not good,"I can't understand why people are liking this Twilight. I tried to see something but just couldn't. ƒ∞n this first movie everything is so pale and emotionless though it is supposed to be a love story. Well, I can't feel any love here. They are too cold to each other. Kirsten Stewart seems too cold, it is her who is supposed to be the vampire because she seems to have no emotions. The dialogs are too simple and not interesting at all, they are banal. And how can people idealize this love when it just seems wrong. Who would fall in love with this ugly pale scary looking guy? Only the clumsy pale Bella would lol I like Kirsten Stewart but this wasn't for her. I would prefer Emma Watson in this role. She could express the feelings better and make it more believable.

I didn't hate it.,"I'm gonna go right out and say it, I didn't hate this! I kind of enjoyed it. It was more good than bad. It was alright, but after this one it went so fast down hill that the whole carriage crashed and burned.I don't have that much to say about it, really. I can say that most of the ""action""scenes are pretty bad. The scene where Bella sits on his back, and he runs around, ouch, that's just painfully bad. It looks totally stupid. It's like.. So silly looking.I don't hate Kristen Stewart either. Yeah, she is kind of annoying, but more than that I think she's quite cute, and not that bad an actress. And she isn't stupid either, I think.

"Forget the money, I want my 2 hours back!!","First, I must confess I only watched the DVD and since it was a DVD I watched the film on my own time. Initially I was sceptic about investing two hours on this film and my fears were not misplaced.Though the first five minutes had some element of anxiety, that was the full stop to all things good about the film. I wonder how this film made so much money. I guess vampire crazed fan base is the only reason.The life of a film is its story and the characters and I found a lack of both. There are no more than five characters who contribute to the already flimsy plot. And even the characters that were there were not portrayed very well.There was absolutely no chemistry between the vampire guy and his dame and to make things worse, the story seems way too abrupt and it seems the crew spent far too much time on elaborating unnecessary details rather than fabricating a decent story.Perhaps, the only thing ""good"" about this film was the way it looked with the eerie backdrop. It manages to usher in a sense of excitement as if one was waiting for something to happen. But, unfortunately that poor one is kept waiting until the end of the film. To be honest I was relieved to see the credits.The lack of characters and the slow pace of 'Twilight' might have worked for the book, but the film adaptation really needs an overhaul-already.Verdict: Trash it! And a piece of advice-stay away from the next installment because it is probably going to be as bad if not worse.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Pamela Boholst saw this and was disappointed... BIG TIME!,"I didn't actually get a chance to read the book. (Well, I don't read in the first place). But after the obsession of many of my classmates in reading the book and watching the movie in cinemas or telesync DvDs, it came to my senses that this title might be entertaining. Now, 4 months later I got a chance to watch the film. The first 12 minutes were beginning to bore me but I didn't surrender. The fact is that I finished the entire film and wondered: ""How could one earth be a nostalgic fan of the novel when the movie itself sucked big time?"". It was produced on a low budget movie company releaser and span almost 2 precious hours of my life. Even some who liked the book so much told me that they didn't liked the movie.

"awely totalsome - not undead, just bored-to-death","... I vaguely remember what knocked me out... was it the moment Bella Lugoswan first met the deathly pale Edward Cullen? That was a like a half-hour into the movie, after chat chat chat with her divorced parents, and then with her too-average-for-words highschool friends... Edward - smelled her. Heck, I smelled her, everyone in the theater smelled her. ""Oh, wow, he's totally awesome!"" my niece remarked - ah, it was that phrase, ""totally awesome,"" it's meaningless generality shot through me like a venom. I swooned. Flashing lights swirled all about me. I imagined I was watching a vampire movie - the undead stalking in the night, springing on their victims with bared fangs, tearing throats open, letting loose great spouts of blood! Then the vampire slayer burns the mark of the cross in the arm of the Prince of Evil, who springs back howling, crashing through the stained glass window of the ancient castle, plummeting to earth where the vampire slayer hammers the stake home just before the sun's first light at dawn rips the bloodsucker's skin into flakes of putrid, decaying rot - ! Slowly I came out of it, only to realize my nightmare had been in vain, I was still watching ""Twilight."" It was nearly an hour later - and nothing had happened yet! - they were still talking - and talking and talking! The vampire glistened in the sunlight. The vampire used superhuman strength to save the innocent. The vampire was ""beautiful,"" and sensitive, and sweet, and very well-educated (he graduated highschool 20 times!) and he supported all the popular liberal causes. The vampire ate... tofu?

Good romantic movie for teen demographic,"The Twilight Saga can easily be comparable to Harry Potter for quite a lot of reasons, both are based on popular books for teenagers about fantasy worlds that were later adapted for the big screen for both fans and newcomers to enjoy! Unlike Harry Potter though, people are feeling rather mixed about Stephanie Mayer's tale, some say it's a great human-vampire love story, while others say it's really dumb and even nonsensical. And today's review is going to be about the first film adaptation of the series.It begins with our main heroine Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) a 17 year old girl that recently moved in the small town Forks with her dad. And of course she has to go into a new school where she meets Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) who seemed to be different from the rest of the students. Like having superspeed or his eye color being changed. Later it turned out that Edward was actually a vampire! This led Bella to confusion at first, but after Edward convincing her that he's right and that he also wanted to protect her from the bloodthirsty vampire trio that consisted of James (Cam Gigandet), Victoria (Rachelle Levefre) and Laurent (Edi Gathege), Bella started to trust him. The story is a combination of a typical cute teenage romance and fantasy vampire-werewolf stories. Despite having a generic plot, it's concept is what it makes the movie stand out from other similar stories. I also feel like it was a little bit inspired by Anne Rice's novel and the 1994 movie called ""The interview with Vampire"", by letting vampires have super abilities. For example, Edward can read everyone's (except Bella's) minds, his adoptive sister Alice having an ability to see into the future and Jasper having an ability to manipulate emotions. However, unlike the other movie I've mentioned, where the creatures are closer to the original version of themselves, these ones are more modernized to be more teen-friendly. Like instead of dying from direct sunlight, they sparkle, which may sound silly, but at least it's less painful for them. As for acting, I heard lot's of haters saying that Kristen Stewart is talentless and emotionless, but you have to keep in mind that this is not a comedy film, where everyone has to laugh or cry or act crazy on any giving situation. So I can't blame her. And besides, it's not her fault, she tried her best to act to also fit the tone of the movie. The romantic aspect is cute, and it's well executed, especially comparing to Tessa's and Hardin's in ""After"" where they had little to no chemistry. With Edward's and Bella's relationship, it's actually more believable. Since Edward saved his future girlfriend from a possible car crash, he realised that he should protect her at all cost. Now that's what I call a good chemistry in a movie. Some may say it's cheesy, but at least it's not rushed like the other couple I've mentioned, and both had more than enough time to develop their feelings! I think that this is exactly how boys should act with their girlfriends by being supportive and protective (but not too overprotective in real life, since in the sequels Edward crosses the line). But I also would like to mention Jacob Black, who is another mystical being called the werewolf, who suspects Edward, since in the past, their tribes didn't had the best relationships with the werewolves protecting humans and vampires killing and drinking their blood. But in the present day, the latter prefer to be mostly drink Animal blood, with the exception of James and his friends, who constantly try to hunt Bella. The world building is well done. It explains on how everything works well, including who the characters are and what their motives are. The forest scenery looks beautiful, even though it's mostly cloudy and foggy, it fits the mystical atmosphere perfectly! My favourite scene has to be the baseball one. It's pretty energetic with it's pacing and soundtrack. We mostly see Bella and the Cullen family running on the field during a stormy day. I personally enjoyed this scene.Here's one more important thing I have to say, is that this is a movie made for teenagers, and you shouldn't expect an immediate masterpiece. Just expect a decent romantic-fantasy film with some vampires and werewolves and you would be able to enjoy. As for myself, I had a pretty good time with it. It had heart, action and threat. All 3 aspects were nicely executed and I can recommend it to 13-19 year olds. But older people can enjoy it as well in the right mindset.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Disappointing,"I have to say this is actually one of the worst movies I have ever seen. At first, after forcing myself through the movie, I thought that it might be because of my high expectations after reading the excellent books. But actually, it's not. I do understand that the budget was low for this film, and they really tried to follow the book. However, the acting was horrendous, the storyline moved way too fast, and there was no emotion whatsoever. It was a mix of a Super Mario game from the early 90's and a high school project. I read the books so quickly...I couldn't put them down. My mistake was watching the movie - COMPLETELY ruined the book for me. Hopefully the change of director and more money for the second movie will make it bearable - but the actors need to step it up as well.Horribly disappointing.

The haunting magic of a teen spirit lost in a sensual spell.,"This film is quite sensational, it used to be quite groundbreaking in its time for its reinvention of the genre, in particular the dynamics in the portrayal of romance within such a genre. And you can feel its power, you can imagine and believe in its mythical world this film is building, that's a craft of magic, almost every shot carries a sense of longing, mystery and romance, perfectly capturing adolescent spirit lost in a sensual spell of forbidden and unexplored, while conjuring the haunting wonder and magick of Vampire lore that Bram Stoker imagined in his classic novel - the romance and horror merging together to create the world of mystery and sensuality, from my view he never had in mind to stress out horror, it was a perfect balance of love, sensuality, terror and mystery, and in this saga of films that is indeed masterful, without hyperbole perhaps the best most authentic portrayal of the dynamics of fear and love in a vampire world on screen to this day. Most films or shows about vampires, especially in recent decades have never dared to capture the seductive nature of love and terror in such an equal measure and balanace, the more terrifying the more seductive it is in this franchise, and that's what I feel is what Bram Stoker tried to capture, this real old myth existing in our culture for centuries. As a vampire film, Blood and Roses from 1960 might have made this balance successfully as well.The film also flows gently like a wind touching the mystical and unreal. Truly beautiful and powerful example of a moving cinema at its best. Also it has to be said, this is among Pattinson's very best performances to me, the role he was born to do, fully based on subtlety and understatement, playing with the mastery of body language to a very good effect, it is true that he was never as good as in this series, which has a lot to do with the character he was given too, although he's been a very good actor since then. The impact on pop culture and cinema is very rare to happen, and there is indeed a reason it has gained such a huge following worldwide.The pop culture landmark film that appear once in a while, the same like Wild One, To Have And Have Not, Saturday Night Fever, Easy Rider, 9¬Ω Weeks, Dirty Dancing, Pretty Woman, Clueless and Meet Joe Black, these films manage to target a specific audience, the right kind of cult audience it is either intended for, or who find themselves at its highest vibrational alignment with such films, I feel these are always the people that are the most conducive ambassadors of their quality and value, to provide a passageway towards their highest artistic potential for a human being. For every film does have a perfectly resonating target audience that can penetrate into its essence and throroughly evaluate it as it deserves to be, and perhaps the more perceptive or open minded individuals can find attunement or feel into such individuals, to find resonance with them first, to feel what they feel, before experiencing the same resonance with those films. Follow your heart, and you'll find pleasure out of every art, every song or film you encounter, for you become their highest energetic counterpart.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"A entertaining movie, but very clich√©","I am possibly one of the few guys in the world that actually enjoys these movies, and their book counterparts. This movie is very entertaining and has a good story, buried under that cheesy poor writing.The movie starts off with promise, and its visually appealing, it is shot rather well. But when the movie goes on it changes and their are some truly cringe worthy moments. The dialogue here is dreadful at times, and you could find yourself looking away, or even skipping past it.The acting is not bad either, Kristen Stewart does a very good job here, while her performance dies over the course of the series, you can believe her acting here. Robert Pattinson does a mediocre performance as the vampire Edward Cullen. Their chemistry on camera is good, but the best as it could have been, but enough to understand their relationship.While this movie does have its moments, like the baseball scene, the fight scene at the end and the Dance scene. It is filled with ridiculous writing, not even the book has this much terrible writing.The portrayal of the vampires is what people will despite the most, they have no fangs, they don't burn in sunlight and they are almost superheroes. This movie fails to add the creepy atmosphere a vampire movie should have, and does a poor job and making you fear the main antagonist of this film.This movie is not bad, and if you can look past the bad writing, and enjoy it for what it is, you could respect it more.

No character in any of the characters,"The unlikeliness in this story simply is too high. Let's simply sum up the main lines in the two main characters: One of them is an ancient vampire, full of life experiences and cultural understanding very few people will ever obtain. The other is a teenage girl, with absolutely nothing in common with this ancient creature, however this is supposed to be the beauty in the story, (the VERY clich√©-like model): The meeting of opposites. HOWEVER this attempt simply is too far out. ALSO, the characters don't evolve during the entire movie, (except they fall in love)... This movie basically contributes with nothing.This is one of many modern vampire stories, where vampires co-exist with humans in modern society.

A Classic Love Story With A Twist,"Up until three years ago I never heard of this movie or read the books by Stephanie Meyer it was only after i borrowed the film from my sister that I saw why people fell in love with it. Twilight tells the story of a modern day teenage girl who falls in love with a vampire it was the best epic romance film in years.Robert Pattinson & Kristen Stewart portray the star crossed couple pretty well they have great chemistry on screen their performance throughout the film was amazing.Pattinson's the sexiest vampire I've seen since Brad Pitt in 1994's Interview With The Vampire, the scenery and action sequences were visually incredible.I have all four books in the series as well as the films and can't wait until Breaking Dawn comes out in theatres and then on DVD.At 17 years old Bella Swan (Stewart) is different she's never been one to run with the popular kids at her school or be part of a social clique that consists of snobby girls.When she moves to Forks, Washington to live with her father chief of police Charlie (Burke)she doesn't expect too much to happen,however the course of her life is about to change forever.On her first day of school she makes new friends with Mike (Welch) Jessica (Kendrick), Eric (Chon) and Angela (Serratos) Bella becomes intrigued when she sees the Cullen siblings including 17 year old Edward (Pattinson) a boy with a dark secret. After some research and occurrences where he possesses quick speed and strength she finds out he's a vampire, in 1918 he was on the verge of death due to Spanish influenza in order to save him his adoptive father Carlisle (Facinelli) transformed him so he would forever remain a teenager. As their different worlds and hearts collide he struggles with the lust burning inside him and deals with a trio of deadly vampires who want to harm his girlfriend.she also meets the rest of his family mother Esmee (Reaser), brothers Jasper (Rathbone) & Emmett (Lutz)then finally his sisters Alice (Greene) who treats Bella like a sister and Rosalie (Reed) who dislikes her because she's human.For fans of romantic fantasy and action Twilight is a crowd pleaser sure to entertain legions of fans everywhere7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

hey kiddie kiddie,"Is there another movie that has so much comments as this one, you have the hatred and the loved ones. Everybody told me to stay away from this movie but after 2 years I thought it was time to spend 2 hours of my life to watch this acclaimed flick. I just watched it so I could talk about it, my wife would like to see it so here we go. People who know me here in my native country or who know me via youtube or this site know that I am a horror geek. So there we have the first problem. All the sites concerning horror are tearing this one to bits. When the end credits were running on the flat screen my only opinion was, let's have a look at the lady. And even she wasn't so much amused with watching Twilight. Our opinion was, this is definitely NOT a horror flick, this is just a romantic movie just to be happening with vampires. I can understand that teenagers who are falling in love are really looking up to this flick. Remembering my youth there was Grease and other romantic movies. I wouldn't say that this is Grease of the 'OO because they don't sing but I can understand that there was a gap for the teenies after the ending of Harry Potter. But to say and understand that grown ups like this flick, that I can't just get it. There is really nothing going on. Just when you think, a-ha now the vampires will strike the movie cuts away to another scene. The only part were really something is going on is the part were a member of another clan is being killed. That part I enjoyed. The other 115 minutes are just talking and talking about why and when and how they should become a couple. The vampire going into the sun is another issue, diamonds look-a-like appearing on his skin, and the fast movements in the woods. No thanks, just give me the old vampires. But again, for me I just would give it a 2, due the reaction of my immortal one sitting here in the settee. But I must admit that I will watch the second part just to see it, no expectations at all...if you are a teenager under 16 you really will love it but if you are older...put a stake through it! It's strange that another teenage flick being released flopped, but there you also had the vampire story in it and there really something went on, I'm talking about Jennifer's Body.

"Pretty Good Adaptation of Novel, Save Minor Details","Unlike ""Blood and Chocolate"" - for which I have also reviewed - which failed to make the novel it was based after tangible and true to the storyline, ""Twilight"" was a pretty good adaptation of the best-selling novel it was modeled after. In my opinion, there has been no greater book-to-film adaptation than this with the exception of the ""Harry Potter"" films and ""The Notebook."" ""Twilight"" managed to maintain the same storyline and sequence of events; even some of the dialogue was straight from the book. The film is narrated by one of the main characters, Isabella ""Bella"" Swan, which gives a slight leeway into the character's thoughts, although, that which her words manage to express, her actions seem to falter doing. Kristen Stewart, who plays Bella, succeeds at one thing throughout the entire film - expressing the vulnerability that humans are equipped with and the pain of being engrossed in a forbidden love affair. Otherwise, her acting can be considered very one-note. Having read the novel myself, I knew Bella beforehand to have been a bookworm (Kristen Stewart never even picks up a book, save to do her homework), passionate (her love for Edward could have been stressed a lot more), and quite emotional. Stewart portrayed Bella the way she may have been were she only clumsy and angsty. Edward, played by Robert Pattinson, was in a word, mysterious. The character Edward Cullen is portrayed in the novels as being ""The Perfect Man."" He walks as though he is dancing, his voice is sweeter than the music of Debussy, and he is every bit as polite as any boy of the early 20th century. In short, he is unrealistically perfect. Pattinson brings out the brooding side of Edward Cullen - the part of him that refuses to be the monster that he is doomed to be eternally. But through all of the gloom and doom, he does a better job than Kristen Stewart does at displaying love for his significant other. He looks at Bella adoringly and protectively, while Stewart - despite the fact that she claims to be unafraid of her undead boyfriend - seems hesitant and scared of him throughout the entire film.Ashley Greene, who played Alice Cullen, played the character straight to a T. She walked with music in her step, she was about as light and airy as a sprite, and although she was not as beautiful as I had thought, she was certainly adorable. Her partner, Jasper Hale (Jackson Rathbone) did a good job and displaying Jasper's self-restraint when trying to avoid feasting on humans, as well as with his portrayal of hostility, but the shocked look that remained on his face during almost the entire film was a little over the top.Nikki Reed was not the woman whom I expected could pull of playing Rosalie Hale. After all, the woman is a natural (dark) brunette and is nowhere near as pale as she needed to be; and the blonde wig and powdered face that they had befitted her with took away from her natural beauty. However, reed made up from her lack of similar appearance in her performance, which fit the character quite well. Her boyfriend, Emmett Cullen was just as how I hoped he would be. Although he played the protective brother, he was still the self-confident, manly-man (or manly-vampire) that he needed to be.Taylor Lautner did a great job playing Jacob Black. There was a comment on this website that mentioned that he was not ""manly"" enough; but in the first novel of the series, Jacob isn't manly at all. He is a conventional adolescent boy, which wasn't a difficult task for Lautner to pull off, seeing as how he is only sixteen-years-old.Minor characters such as Charlie Swan, Esme Swan, Billy Black, Mike Newton, Jessica Stanley, Eric Yorkie, and Angela Weber were beautifully portrayed by the actors who played them. They were almost identical to the characters in the novel. Esme and Carlisle Cullen were also great matches in the film, even though Carlisle's hair and makeup looked ridiculous at times.In general, the actors in the film did a fairly good job. The romance between Edward and Bella could have been portrayed through more than just a few intense glares and a make-out scene, but it is understandable that the director only had a specific time frame to work with. Whether or not you have read the books, the movie is at least worth seeing once.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
ROBSTEN 2020 also i adore this film,"Great film i find such joy watching this movie one of my guilty pleasures love everything to do with the film, hopefully another one is made. Also i ship robsten so badly like get back together",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Guilty pleasure for sure!,"I have always been judged by liking this movie but who cares. Movie's supposed to be entertaining and enjoyable to watch. And I can say that this movie is it. I repeated this countless times. As a girl with anxiety, it's a bit difficult to watch new movies because you're getting anxious on what's going to happen. Twilight has always been my comfort movie. It always gives me a good feeling everytime I watch it.Love the cinematography, the iconic blue tint, and most especially the soundtrack! I just wish it's a bit longer to capture more of the book's storyline. I appreciate how some lines from the book were used. Nevertheless, OBSESSED WITH IT!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Dreadful,"Just simply awful. On every level. I'm only writing more because the review needs at least 10 lines of text. Throughout the film I kept thinking I had missed something. I completely misread situations, because the performances just didn't match what was supposed to be going on. You just can't read any emotion from either of them - it's impossible. It was such a relief when Edward smiled on occasion - at last, a brief moment where I understand what at least one of them is feeling. I don't think I've ever been more confused by a film. The whole thing is about their relationship - and I don't think I ever felt that I had a clue what either of them was supposed to be feeling. They both looked so uncomfortable. And maybe that's because they are supposed to be, but it just came across as two people acting incredibly badly. Amazingly bizarre film. Like a really bad episode of a really bad teen soap.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Couldn't even finish it,"Even if I hand't read the books first, this movie would have been a disappointment to me. The acting was poor at best, and Robert Pattinson did not have the presence to portray Edward effectively. He came off as whiny and always had a look on his face that missed ""tortured vampire hero"" entirely. Looked more like he had a bad case of indigestion. Kristen Stewart's almost constant stuttering made the dialog difficult to follow, even for someone who knew most of the dialog from the book already. Add all this to lackluster special effects, cheesy acting by supporting players, Kristen Stewart's monotone narrative, and some rather irritating deviations from the book made it a rather unpleasant experience. I only made it halfway through the film before turning the DVD player off and sending the disk back to the rental store.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Best Vampire Story Ever !!,"I saw other Twilight saga first so I'm biased in this review. If this was the first Twilight I've seen, it would have been much difficult to understand the story.Bella moved from Phoenix Arizona to Forks Washington. There she enters high school, and meets Edward. Edward is bit unusual, and Bella suspects that there's more to him than what he's willing to tell, but she can't exactly pin point to what it is. In the mean time, there's strange killing going on in the forest. Edward finally confesses that he's a vampire, but of a ""vegetarian"" kind, and don't kill humans. They both fall in love with each other. One day, the ""other"" vampires who's been killing people in the forest shows up, and wants to ""eat"" Bella. Edward tries to defend her, but they got her mom, and by her own volition, she goes to meet the vampires.I usually don't go for vampire movies, especially the old school kind, but this is story done elegantly, with romance, intrigue, and action. This is the first vampire movie that I really liked. Story develops rather slowly, and it's good that series continued, because not enough is said in this first installment. Picture is beautiful, and casts are best of the young actors.Great movie, that should be seen as a series. Otherwise you'll miss the good parts.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

When you can live forever what do you live for?,"Seventeen-year-old Isabella ""Bella"" Swan moves to the small town of Forks, Washington, to live with her father. There, she finds herself drawn to a mysterious classmate, Edward Cullen, who is revealed to be a 108-year-old vampire but is physically seventeen. Although Edward discourages the romance at first, they soon fall deeply in love. When the arrival of three nomadic vampires puts Bella's life in danger, Edward and his family put their lives at stake to save her.You may question yourself now, ""What is with this hype?"", ""Have the world gone mad?"", or even ""Should I even see this?"" You don't know what this is all about but you're curious. This is where I come in, and other millions of reviews you can read to gain answers from these questions and even millions more. No, I have not read the books. Actually, I have chosen to try to watch movies before I read their original sources because comparing the two can cause huge problems. *cough*Harry Potter*cough* No, I'm not a fan, so I WAS in the same boat as you. To start this off, I wasn't looking forward to this film. So why did I see this? My brother read the book and wanted to see the movie. But now I can say I left the theater with a huge smile on my face.So what is this hype? It's nothing different than the ""Harry Potter"" frenzy and any other frenzy you can think of (LotR, Star Wars, etc). This is basically a vampire love story for this year's generation, and I'm part of it (which might be another reason the movie appealed to me). So what's different about this than other vampire love stories? I guess it has to deal with the young cast, which gives off a hint of freshness, if you ask me. No doubt, the target demographic for this film are the fans of the books, plus millions of teenage girls. If you're not apart of it, well, I guess you can do yourself a favor and skip this movie. It's not for you. Howver, there is a small chance for teenage guys and people who haven't read the books but are curious to see this movie to like the film. Hello, I'm one of them so take that risk if you will.The love story presented in the movie has a timeless feel to it. I'm a sentimental fellow so it's no surprise I was brought into it very quickly. However, that doesn't mean the movie is flawless. There are some moments in the film that is just downright cheesy and awkward. Take this scene, for example: The first time Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson meet each other is awkward, but this is probably a bad example because I think it was supposed to be that way. There are some lines in here that was also very awkward and cheesy. There's one about heroine. You don't want to know. But apart from those flaws, the film does a great job giving us a fantastic romance.A high point in this film is, surprisingly, the performances by almost everyone in the movie. Judging by the movie trailer, Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson might give off some bad vibes but that's because you're not watching the movie as a whole. Trust me, Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson both give off some fantastic performances, not to mention a great chemistry. The supporting cast also do a very great job as well, for what they're given.The music choices for this movie is very weird, but you'll get used to it. It's a mix of rock and perhaps Gothic (I couldn't tell, exactly). The direction by Catherine Hardwicke does a great job showing us some fantastic views of nature. In total, I was swept away by four fantastic sequences in the movie. I won't tell you because it'll ruin the surprise. One thing that bothered me about this film was that, and it may be just me, the film should've gotten a better distributer because the film looks low budget compared to other film adaptations and it is (a budget of about $37 million). I just wished that the film could've gotten a more well known distributer so that it could've gotten a bigger budget so the film would look less amateur and better special effects. Like I said, it may be only me.Overall, the film surprised me big time, surpassing way over my expectations and probably some other people that are going to see it too. If you're a fan of the books and/or a teenage girl, there's no doubt you should see this movie. If you're not, you probably will not like the movie, although there's still a small chance that this miracle can happen. If you're one of those people who feels like it's the end of the world because of this huge fan base and this huge success for this movie, don't complain because we all know this movie isn't for you so just stop whining that there will be an apocalypse. In the end, this movie is basically a huge setup for the next three movies (hopefully, they will get made) but that's not a bad thing because you get a great romance with a fantastic showdown in the end.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
It's as terrible and horrible as they say- this is a movie for teen girls and it's not very smart.,"OK, for all you teen drunk girls out there that got your idea of what a vampire is from anything but a properly written book will eat this up like mana from the gods.But if you actually know what a vampire is from the old legends when people would actually be killed for being a vampire or they would lock up villages in fear of them- this is no vampire movie.This movie basically turns the entire vampire legend and any logic or authenticity whatsoever spills on the floor like entrails.This is teen drama from start to finish, with no research or logical plot writing. For instance- multi- century old vampires still being petty and talking as much as they do or getting upset over small things. That just doesn't make any sense. This script is obviously written by mentally impaired people FOR mentally impaired people, that think they are clever with TWISTS instead of logical story telling that grips you with a suspension of disbelief.If you don't look too deep into this and enjoy a teen drama you might enjoy this. If you are looking for a smart, interesting vampire movie- which is what stupid people will try to sell this as- this is NOT IT.This movie really is a huge pathetic let down and a testament to the continual pandering instead of art.PLOT: I'm in highschool and I'm in love with a vampire. Oh snap, the drama of it all, nobody understands our forbidden love wah. Oh he might eat me too. Yeah- fat girls that love harlequin novels will LOVE THIS JUNK.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
please read this before going to the movie- it's good and very funny,"I really hope that people lighten up about the movie and stop comparing it to the book. The book was amazing, so there's little chance that the movie can compare If people continue to shoot down movies that are trying to give an enthralling story without including EVERY minute detail from the book, then let it go. You will never end up satisfied. There's no competition, so stop thinking about it as the book's movie and accept it as a movie. I liked the movie. It was WAY funnier than I thought it would be. Very awkward and dry humor moments get me. The acting was a little iffy at times, but accept it and try to support the actors/actresses and other staff. I really hope they continue with the series.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Marketing research or film?,"This film is a brilliant example of market research, a product that is perfectly crafted for its target audience, middle-class females ages 12-16. And I sincerely mean that. I know of few films that have so captured the romantic angst of early feminine puberty, and have done so in a pop-cultural idiom touching - at least lightly - on all the hip romantic fads this age group inherits from its parents and elder siblings, from 'goth' to 'Native American spirituality.' It also references much more violent films of the 'vampire' genre without ever betraying its softly shaded early-teen 'sensitiveness.' But good marketing does not necessarily make good film. If you like this film and you are not a middle-class female aged 12-16, you really need to ask yourself why you want to be a middle-class female aged 12-16, because such is the only audience that would not be appalled by this extremely long, drawn-out, soap-operatic ""Dark Shadows"" style inversion of the old Archie comics.Some other reviewer wrote that he didn't see the 'so bad it's funny' elements of the film. Please, sir, understand that the very idea of vampires playing baseball is inherently grotesque, and amusing for that reason - it's amazing Mel Brooks didn't come up with the idea for ""Dead - and Loving It."" Also, the repeated references to the scent of the heroine driving vampires wild had my friends and me telling feminine hygiene jokes for a good half-hour - deservedly so, since the market research that went into this film is clearly manifested here in the not so subtle reference to the body odors young girls become acutely aware of as they enter their menses. And the first indication that the film is soon to become a trash classic is the very appearance of the vampire hero. Bad enough that the actor was chosen because he looks like an 'emo' cross between an anorexic Joaquin Phoenix and a James Dean suffering manic-depression. But then there's that HAIR! It's precisely the kind of cut young girls think guys should wear.The point being: the situations, the dialog, the very appearance of the film, although all well-crafted to sell to a target audience, make the film hilariously bad when it doesn't simply just drag (which it does quite a bit).All this sounds like I'm trashing the intended audience of this film as much as the film itself. Not necessarily. When I was very young, I really thought the comedies of Don Knotts (e.g., ""The Incredible Mr. Limpet"") were utterly charming. Although some films I liked as a child I still find amusing (e.g., Three Stooges shorts), I got over my tolerance for Don Knotts by the age of 14. Had his films been worth seeing for someone younger than ten? Sure. Were they utterly atrocious cinematic sludge? You bet. Back in the '60s, 'New Critics' of various arts convinced us that we had to like great art - which also meant, inversely, that we had to defend entertainment we enjoyed as great art. That simply isn't so. If you're a middle-class female aged 12-16, enjoy this feast, it was prepared for you. As you mature you may yet develop more enlightened tastes - the Cullen family did, after all.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Wow! Was this slow and boring!,"I bought this book on a whim this summer for my daughter and for my wife. They loved it. My daughter says it's the best book she ever read. So, being pleased that I actually purchased something for the ladies that they liked I decided I'd keep being a hero and surprise them with tickets to this on the opening weekend. 'I'm not their hero anymore.I got to the theater early as we all wanted to sit together and we were expecting crowds (not as big as we thought), but my son (age 9) and I got seats while my wife and daughter (age 11) got popcorn. I was a little uncomfortable as we sat in the theater before the movie started with the noisiest bunch of women this side of a Beatles' concert.I was excited, but I was also realistic. This didn't need to be ""Casablanca"" to make me happy. Just give me a 7 star flick.At some point I started hoping their would be a scene with enough light in it for me to check my watch. At another point my son whispered to me, ""Dad, this is a HORRIBLE movie."" I never knew the fellow to not like anything (other than church).First of all the two glaringly bad things. The make-up made ""The Munsters"" look subtle. The special effects looked like they were done by a middle school video club.The plot was very slow and their was no conflict for the first 90 minutes. We got Bella sitting around talking to this unrealistically nice friends (One boy didn't realize he was gay, but maybe that comes up in a later book). Her worst problem seems to be that she has two great parents and every boy in the town wants to take her to the prom. We do have a 4-second action scene. Bella discovers almost nothing for herself. She does go to the book store and check out a book, but then hardly uses it and instead goes on the Internet and finds out that Edward is a vampire.Still, after that he just tells her everything about being an umpire (uhhhh, no that's a different scene)...vampire. The Vampires, I understand, are supposed to be incredibly good looking, but they're not up to speed in those regards (except for about four of them).There is an incredibly stupid baseball scene where they actually wear baseball uniforms which just comes across as absurd (and why, if they want to protect Bella so much, would they take her out during a thunderstorm?).After waiting forever for some conflict to happen, it finally does, and is over in about 5 minutes.It also seemed that Edward was attracted to Bella because he wanted to eat her worse than other humans. Huh? I mean I really wanted to eat my candy in the theater but I wasn't really attracted to it in that way.The ending of the movie seemed to just be tacked on.I was fascinated by the other Vampires (both good and bad), but learned nothing about them, except that one of the ""good"" vampires was grumpy about Edward dating Bella. I was also fascinated with the ""Native Americans,"" but we only got a couple of none-to-subtle hints about what they were.The thing is, I felt like this movie made the mistake of telling me what was happening instead of showing me what was happening. No matter how good a book is, a movie has to be a movie, and this was mostly just a lot of talking.My daughter was depressed the rest of the day as she had been so excited to see this. My wife said, she could have taken it being slow, but that the make-up ruined it for her. My son was just ready for some buffalo wings and refused to talk about the movie at all.Still, the scenery was beautiful when they got in the woods, and this only increased my appetite for a thru-hike of the Pacific Crest Trail.All in all, I'll take almost any episode of ""Buffy, The Vampire Slayer"" over this.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Better then average...,"Bella Swan is a teen girl that lived almost her entire life with her mother.When her mother remarries she decides to move into a little town called forks to live with her father.She settles well in this new place and quickly makes new friends despite the fact that she doesn't quite fit the crowd.

Twilight is not a brilliant film but to say that it is awful is quite a stretch...Edward and Bella's relationship is the main theme and all the vampire-related story line takes a secondary place which may not please everyone.Both Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson delivered great performances, the cinematography is great and the film builds up in a good pace.Not having read the book I was still able to enjoy the film but I have a feeling the book is better; I don't think fans will be too disappointed though. 6/10",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Over-hyped Nonsense (coming from an unbiased point of view),"Don't get me wrong - this movie has its very limited good moments, such as the occasional comedic scenes. It's also not the worst movie I've ever seen, but the good things end there.This movie had incredible potential. I read the books, was not that impressed, so I thought I would give the movie a chance. Believe me, this is coming from a completely unbiased point of view. In my opinion, you can't just rate a movie based on how ""hot"" the actor is or how ""cute"" a relationship is.Every scene just fell short of what you expect, and left me thinking, ""Oh...I wish they would have done this instead of that..."" The scenes were choppy, and the camera was often at awkward angles. The music often did not match what was on the screen at all. I understand that romances are hard to make as it is, not even mentioning adding the vampire aspect of it. But this movie evoked no emotion whatsoever. Even as Bella lies on a hospital bed hooked up to an IV, you can't help but scoff at her cheesy, scripted lines. Everything from how the actors dress to how they take themselves so seriously is hilarious in an unintended way. Even how the movie is colored is depressing - its like the gray monotone of a bad horror movie. I hope the director learns her lesson and takes more time to make the next Twilight movie worth watching, not just hoping that fans are so blind that they'll like it no matter what.Bottom line is, if you haven't read the book and aren't obsessed with the series, my suggestion is to wait to rent it and then laugh at how badly it was made. Or flip through some soap operas and you'll get the same effect. I just feel sorry to the ""Twirds"" who went at midnight and got this dump of a movie.I'm just excited because you can tell that they're going to make a huge parody of it.

Highly overrated,"This movie sucked if I'm going to be honest. Bella gives off typical Wattpad y/n vibes who is super innocent and beyond dense. I'm pretty sure she said ""suffer in silence"" one point in the movie. She gained a concerning connection to Edward after only one day of knowing him despite him not even speaking to her once and he literally asked to switch classes after just looking at her. Not to mention that annoying thing she does with her face whenever someone is talking to her.Edward is weird. He continually stared at Bella. It really bothers me how much he stares at her and the way he talks is beyond irritating. He also switches up on Bella every 5 seconds. One moment he would tell her that she should stay away from him while he is following her. Quite frankly, if I knew him is real life we would've fought.The movie overall is just really horrible, cringe, boring, and disappointing. I'm disappointed in how many people genuinely enjoyed this and called it romantic. Their ""relationship"" is extremely toxic and that's because of Bella's weird attachment to him and his contradicting behavior. I'm pretty sure someone could make a live action of the Bible and it would still be more romantic than this. The characters are also insanely plain. I say this with all respect; if you genuinely enjoy this movie, better yet this franchise, stay 20+ feet away from me or else I'm going to spray you with Raid Insect Killer.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Nah... but cool atmosphere and kinda entertaining.,"This movie was, Well interesting...I'll start with the negatives and move on to the positive stuff.Negative stuff:I honestly Don't Think that the relationship( which is the movies major plot point) works.And before I go on with the review i will admit that i have read none of the twillight books.But still if the relationship is portraied amasingly in the books that shouldn't effeckt the movie. The movie should be able to work independently from the books.But yeah honestly Bella and Edward are in a really abusing relationship. Edward is pretty arrogant in my opinion and Bella should definently drop him (epecially after the scene where he littereally admits to her that he watches her while she sleeps at night).""No That's not creepy at all infact That's super romantic.""
No, just no!And they have next to no character development before they get together, they Stare at eachother for a couple scenes, Edward saves Bella and they argue a little about Edwards secret.That's littereally it, there isn't anything i didn't mention.Then later they try to introduce a diffrent plotline, tha't builds up this villain tha't is suposed to be super threating.But the movie just ends that whole plotline ten minutes after it's introduced, why ?¬ø
It's honestly kinda sad cause it could have been a really cool plot point if they had spent more time developing it.It also dosn't make sense that Edward even goes to highschool, he's 107 years Old ( another reason Bella shouldn't date him).Oh yeah and btw none of the vampires have vampireteath.Good stuff:I really like the setting of this movie i wish that more movies had these small town/ foggy forest vipes that this movie actually captures surprisngly Well.The soundtrack didn't Sound that bad either.And there are some pretty cool kinda thretening vampire scenes although they are few and far between.Overall this isn't a movie you need to Watch but still it does manage to entertain pretty well, in a more so bad it's good vipe, than a movie you should take seriously.",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
What the hell is this?,"One scene will forever stick in my mind. Bella wakes up in the middle of the night to find Edward in her bedroom unexpectedly. She asks him why he's there. He responds, ""I like to watch you sleep"". She just accepts it and goes back to sleep. This single scene probably sums up the entirety of Twilight for me - Edward is a predator, Bella is naive, their relationship is contrived, the author doesn't know how human beings behave and I hate it all.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Pretty badly made.,"Wooden acting, bad special effects, plot holes, unintentionally funny in places, poorly paced and bad editing are just a few of the problems with this film. In fact the cardboard acting and staring should have you in hysterics but this is a trend which goes on throughout the franchise in fact. The dialogue is not very good and the narration is so on the nose. The film manages to completely fail at making vampires cool or interesting or real. An episode of Buffy I think contains more action and scares than this film. I was constantly baffled by it really and just have no understanding really over how it did so well at the box office.

Wait for the DVD,"This wasn't the worst film of the year, but it was certainly the most over-hyped. I wasn't familiar with the novels before hand, so I went into this with a completely unbiased mindset. The film was just not good, and since the books garnered such critical acclaim, I'm guessing this film is much worse than the books. The lines were poorly written, the acting was nothing to write home about, and the plot seemed incredibly clich√©.

Twilight is not your typical love story.,"When you hear the word ""Twilight,"" what do you think of? Maybe you picture teenage girls screaming ""Team Edward!"" and ""Team Jacob!""

She appears shy and not too desperate to make friends. When she lays eyes on the brooding Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson), however, she is instantly captivated by his chiseled jawline and rather fluffy hair. Bella soon realized that he is just as enamored as she is.There's a catch, though, of course. Edward and his family have a taste for blood: animal blood, that is. They are not your typical vampire family: they sparkle in the sun and choose to live among humans peacefully. Things get complicated though, when a werewolf by the name of Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) also falls for Bella. She must choose between Jacob, her warm-blooded childhood friend, and Edward, who Jacob calls a ""bloodsucker."" (Can you tell I'm Team Jacob?) This movie does not only consist of the love triangle's drama, however. Things get more problematic when the Cullens' enemies find out they have told a human what they are. These enemies call themselves the Volturi. They are the merciless, black-cape wearing villains that more closely fit the ""vampire"" stereotype. The Volturi does not approve of the Cullens' acceptance of a human into their lives, and this starts a feud between the groups filling the movie with intense, eye-catching action scenes.Although this book series was wildly popular and the movie was highly anticipated, the director, Catherine Hardwicke, manages to give a more ""indie"" feel to the film. The dark hues and enchanting music by Carter Burwell work perfectly together to create a haunting, intense atmosphere. The setting of Forks, Washington is captivating in of itself. The misty mountains and dark forests are the perfect backdrop to this film. The movie not completely completely dark, however, it is also sprinkled with biting humor (pun intended.) Bella's father, Charlie Swan (played by Billy Burke) provides comic relief throughout the movie. He is clueless on how to raise a teenage girl, but he is very caring and protective of her nonetheless. Sure, Twilight's plot is not complicated, but it is not your average love story or vampire story either.Catherine Hardwicke did not stray from Stephanie Meyer's book. She stayed true to the original storyline, characters, and dialogue. Twilight is a film anyone can enjoy. Yes, it is a love story, but it is also much more than that. It is also full of action and humor, and even though vampires and werewolves are involved, it is relatable. The intense actors, haunting music, and beautiful scenery come together to create a unique atmosphere that captivates viewers. Don't let today's Twilight clich√©s and criticisms stop you from enjoying this film. Keep an open mind going into the theater, and you just might leave a Twihard as well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
No Chemistry,"I didn't go into this movie with blinders on...I had seen reviews that weren't overwhelmingly positive, but I so adore the book that I deliberately pushed anything negative I had heard aside and practically *willed* the movie to be good.It wasn't.Seriously, I went in with the attitude that I would forgive almost anything and there were small irritants that I was more than willing to overlook. Continuity issues exist, but that is to be expected in a long book being made into a movie. Some scenes were left out, others were combined in ways that didn't necessarily make sense to me. The makeup was overdone in some ways and lacking in others. The special effects were....cheesy is the nicest word I can come up with.All of that is forgivable in my eyes.The real star of this movie should have been an electric chemistry between Bella and Edward, just the same as the book. That was the most critical part of the film and, in my own humble opinion, was the part that was a dismal failure. There was absolutely *zero* chemistry between these two. Not a single moment that made my breath catch, as the book did. Parts that should have been serious were almost laughable.In fact, almost *none* of the actors portrayed anything like real emotion, as far as I could tell. By the end of the movie, there was no attachment to any of them whatsoever and even if the portrayals had warranted attachment, the storyline was so fast and choppy, it would have deterred me regardless. Pretty much the only standout was Billy Burke's performance as Charlie Swan, which ranked as the most nuanced of the entire film and provided the few moments of genuine humor I saw in it.Overall, a truly disappointing film treatment of a wonderful book. If the same major players follow through with the series, I will likely be giving the rest of the films a miss.",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
One of the best films I've ever seen,"The Twilight film (in contrast to the book) is one of the best films I've seen put together. The script is on point and flows, the direction is flawless, and the editing is organic. All 3 things made by women who were able to capture the female sensibility and romance perfectly. I've never seen another film in the history of cinema that did that.To make it clear: I can't stand the subsequent films, neither any of the books (including the book for this film). The story went off the rails and lost focus after the first book (which itself wasn't as tightly written and smart as the actual scriptwriting for this film). And giving the direction job to male directors for the subsequent films, it lost its magic.But this first film, it's highly on point and I consider it the only valid Twilight experience, I avoid watching ALL the rest of the films.I only subtracted 1 point because I found that the last act with the hunt was made in a rush, in both the film and the book. It should have had a different ending, that puts forward the second film/book, instead of Meyer making the plot up as she went along for these subsequent books/films, making the whole story laughable. She obviously hadn't thought the whole story when she wrote the first book and this is the main problem I have with the saga.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
This movie was a let down.,"As a huge fan of the books, I was so excited to see this movie. I was obsessed with the movie before it even came out. I watched every interview, every trailer, every spoiler, etc.So on November 21st I was just about jumping up and down I was so excited to see this movie. I went straight after school to see it. When it started I almost screamed with excitement.The first 5 minutes of the movie I liked. It pretty much stayed true to the book, but then things were happening all over the place. After that nothing was the same as the book, which made it confusing for someone who hasn't read the books.So I was throughly let down because everything was out of order, but on top of that, THE ACTING SUCKED! It was boring and monotonous the whole movie. No emotions were expressed at all. Plus, I didn't see this chemistry that everyone was talking about. Kristen and Robert look like they want to kill each other. I blame the director, Catherine Hardwick.Another thing that bugs me about this movie is the blue-undertone. I guess it supposed to give the feeling of gloom but it carried on through the whole movie and was quite distracting.On top of all that it looked like it was trying to be made into an action movie instead of a romance. It didn't even touch on Edward and Bella's love at all, which is supposed to be the deepest love ever known.One good thing that I can say about the movie is that the baseball scene is PERFECT!! Exactly what I imagined it to be.So all in all it was a let down. I was mad when I left the theater.So the next day I went to see it again, and after I knew what to expect, which isn't a lot, it was better, because I wasn't looking for the mistakes that the movie is made up of.So after the second time I think that if you didn't read the books then you would like this movie, except you would be a little confused because it's not explained well. And if you have read the books then I feel that this movie is a let down.I hope New Moon will be better than this.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Lost in Translation,"Twilight: Lost in Translation? (half-done)I've been (and still) very passionate about Edward and Bella's love story. But after watching Twilight, I all but found myself stunned (with that ""that was it?"" expression in my face), terribly disappointed and most of all heartbroken from how the movie turned out.¬∞ ALL PREPPED UP FOR DOWNFALL? Leaked ""blue script"", on-location pictures and videos, MTV spoilers, TV Spots, teaser trailers and the EPIC-like theatrical trailer - who wouldn't get excited and expect much about Twilight? After these were let out, isn't it but natural for us to think that the film will be fantastic?But no, I didn't let that get into me. Honestly, I do not remember myself setting or having high or low expectations for the film. I just remember being excited about it and wondered how the filmmakers will make of it - not to mention the fact that I've seen Rob the thrill was inexcusably and unbelievably high in me.I watched it in its original version last Nov. 23rd and very pleased that only half of the 170+ seats were occupied - packed movie house is one thing I avoid and annoying reactions is another I detest . I was the first person to enter the theater and the first one to leave my seat... 30 minutes before its end.The whole rime I was watching, I hadn't realized I was holding my breath. I was so dumbfounded beyond speech - without being aware of it - until I decided to step out. "" Oh my God, what was that?"" was the first thing I said. My reaction towards Twilight, you will say, must have been a total exaggeration but believe me, I couldn't agree more, despite of myself. I got bummed out for like 2 weeks but I'm gradually getting over it. I feel like I have been on the sticky wicket with my walking out.¬∞ DEVIATION FROM THE BOOK Book-to-film movies cater a different approach in film making. It requires intensive book reading for them to have a better grip and understanding of the author's perspective - obviously not just throwing in their ideas, twists or views as if they are writing a fan fiction. Nobody must not expect the movie to be a one dimensional translation of the book. Expect slight alterations and changes as it is how been perceived by a different person.Melissa Rosenberg - if she will ever pen Breaking Dawn's script, I must double the worry that I feel right now but strangely , I still feel hopeful that she'll polish her thing. In Twilight, she captured the right plot points - I give her that - but I felt she missed out on its foundation. It struck me as an interpretation with an inadequate effort to bring out the ""magic"" of the story. Needless to say, they left out the heart and soul of it and settled to invent unimpressive, insignificant scenes which were unnecessary as there were so much of the original text that has been left out.Movies will never be like the books. You don't need to be a Communication Arts student to know this. If you are a purist, do NOT watch adaptations. I don't really care if they feel like taking out numerous portions just to give much focus on a much more definitive storyline. Nevertheless, if the semblance and foundation were not there, that is a major let down for any book reader.If you are a non-reader, you will love the storyline but go buy the book and see for yourself what you have been missing.¬∞ MEDIOCRITY OF THE ESSENCE Character development is crucial factor in presenting the personalities of the role portrayed. Was there any development of any of Twilight's character? I guess there was but I feel like it was ZERO, completely absent.Bella's character is so much more important than any roles in Twilight combined because this is how we see through everything. She's our eyes to Twilight. I think the voice-over narrative of Bella's POV is perfect to establish Bella's character but it was lost throughout the whole movie. It was carried out poorly. What went wrong was that the 'Bella in action' overlapped 'Bella in VO.' I do not know if I was overly observant but 'Bella in action' didn't go well with the VO.As Twilight being in Bella's POV, shouldn't Edward's character be based from how she saw him? You know - decent, compelling, maddeningly in control of himself - but yes, that is from the Twilight book. Nevertheless, aside from the fact Rob needs ideas of being Edward, I just wonder why did they hugely used Edward's inner turmoil (Midnight Sun character) too openly in the movie.Granted that Twilight is mainly the strain between Bella and Edward, I understand why some characters has not been greatly established. I take it that perhaps we just need to suck it up and wait for those characters to be developed in the sequels - anyway, there really is not much of character development yet in Twilight. However, I've never dreamed their interpretation of some characters will look hilarious and weird.I'm sad because the people who went there were surely just went there because of Edward. They missed the charming story of Edward and Bella.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Abercrombie & Fitch vampires,"Mind you I was FORCED to see this film, 'Twilight'. I had no desire to see teenage vampires, followed by the American female tween crowd like sports commentators on ESPN. But when I did see this much heralded film, it was worse than I had anticipated.Anyway, basically, it's a retelling of the Romeo & Juliet story. This time Romeo is a 109-year- old-man lusting after a 17-year-old Juliet. I guess I was the only one offended that some old dude who became a vampire at 17 waits almost a century for his true love. Come on, seriously. This guy waited almost a 100 years to fall in love? Man, and I thought my dating career is a disaster.But needless to say, I am not the audience this move was made for. I sat in on a weekday matin√©e and there were already enough younger girls skipping school to see this cinematic wreck.Because I watch so many movies, I thought I would find something redeeming about this movie. The director is a woman who did the courageous movie, '13', which is a scary film for anyone who has a teenage daughter. This blows away 'Lolita' by miles in the power of a young girl's desires, like a young cobra snake, not knowing the power of its venom. With that said, the directing was malleable.But I thought, this had to be a low budget movie - why? Because most of the scenes take place outside, in the forest. No need to pay extras for those scenes. Additionally, no need to hold back crowds as you film scenes.But the thing that really got under my skin as a film lover is the lack of development of the screenplay. They spent so much time in the protracted, plodding relationship building between the two leads that I was wondering, where is the main conflict? There it is, in the last 10 compacted minutes of the film. Even the danger seemed manufactured. It was as if the producers thought: you know, how do we end this film? The film is based on a series of four books and this is the first one. Still, they really needed to spend more time on the conflict to make the inevitable sequels better than the initial production.To compare, contrast it to the another vampire film based on a book, 'Interview With A Vampire', this conflict is too subtle, along with the whole notion of being a vampire. These are vampires as envisioned by Abercrombie & Fitch, afraid to bare fangs, get bloody, destroy. Apparently they have a pact with the Native American Indian werewolves to keep a peace between them. I am not making this up. Everyone is so bloody nice with great table manners that I was saying enough! Someone BE proud to be a vampire and do some damage.Yes, I was rooting for the bad guys.I guess to maintain an appropriate rating, no viscera was shown, as any other indication that these vampires were remotely dangerous other. The ""vampire"" family that is the hub of the film are SO damn nice, I was wondering if they weren't modeled after The Munsters 1960s t.v. series.The father is the local doctor and looks so young, it would make a normal human wonder why such a young guy and wife adopt so many children who are almost the same age in appearance. They could be a traveling Manson brood, clad in J. Crew flannel apparel. And the father is a doctor, requiring him to touch people to examine him. No one ever notices this guy is cold as ice or has no heartbeat of his own?It would be easy to slam this film but I did find the divorced mother character appealing - why? Not because she was out of the loop as a character but because she was traveling with her husband, a baseball player. Having the daughter live with her father as the mother wandered the country seemed the only original part of this story line.This movie is for young girls waiting to meet their own ""Edward"", the cool misunderstood rebel obviously based on James Dean, to include the hair. But Edward is 109-years-old. He really needs to get over himself, just like me writing protracted musings about a film not made for me.Did I tell you I was FORCED against my will to see this movie? Just needed to remind you.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Really disappointing and stupid( Obviously),"If you thought this movie was going to be good you are dead wrong. This movie sucks not only acting wise but the whole series of books are just puke-in-your-mouth cheesy. The actor that played Bella sucks and all the other actors suck also. Sadly to say but this movie will bring in a lot of money mainly for the success the book has had with teenage girls. and this movie probably will have sequels like the book series but they also will be terrible. This will ruin the actors careers and it should because the all suck and do not no anything about method acting. The whole idea of this version of Vampires suck. Vampires do not Freiking ""Sparkle"" in the daylight seriously. And its way to much of a gushy chick flick. And on a last note of wisdom: A good vampire movie has to be rated R. All I want to see is a good vampire movie with dynamic characters and were the protagonist isn't the main character I want a good anti-hero damn it!!! Bottom line the movie sucks and don't watch it especially if you happen to be a fan of the series it will ruin the already sub-par books for you i guarantee it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
The Characters,"The characters looked GREAT... the movie needs a new directer and WAYYY better special effects... green screen next time? (and I do hope there is a next time) I think so. I really do hope they go on to make New Moon, this hasn't discouraged me. I just think it was a low budget movie with a not so great directer and now that they see how great the turn out has been I hope they will make New Moon and the rest of the Twilight saga with a higher budget (much higher, sheesh!), green screen (cause those actions scenes actually embarrassed me... seriously and I do think a new directer is much needed!

"Not as insufferable as the novel, thankfully","First things first: ""Twilight"" is, quite possibly, the single worst novel I have ever read all the way through. Impossibly incompetent prose (the term 'purple prose' is too kind, and the novel consists almost entirely of dialogue out of an especially bad soap and masturbatory descriptions of Edward which rival the descriptions of the token 'babe' in most pulp fiction), hilariously shallow characterization, bizarre, morally reprehensible attitudes about gender equality and a very strange idea of feminism indeed. Plus, Edward is pure cardboard and Bella is the biggest bitch I can recall from any literature I've read.So, why did I see ""Twilight"" last night? One: an old friend from high school was passing through town and I wanted to see her again (note to self: you stopped associating with morons for a reason). Two: I really liked ""Thirteen"", so I was hoping that Catherine Hardwicke at least did a good job directing this. Three: Kristen Stewart is eye candy, so it can't be THAT bad.Well, how bad was it? Not as bad as the book. The book is pure torture. I found it laughable for a while but ultimately it became truly hard to finish because it was just so unbelievably, incredibly awful. The movie, on the other hand, is, in spite of the hilariously bad visual sensibility after a certain point and Robert Pattinson's poof haircut and lack of acting ability, fairly entertaining in spurts. Well, not really. Sort of tolerable, though. The entertainment comes through ""Dexter"" writer Melissa Rosenberg's uncanny knack for realistic, brilliant dialogue (much like the source material as well as that 'great' television show she writes for):""I dream about being with you forever. """"What a sick, masochistic lion.""""You know, your mood swings are kinda giving me whiplash. """"I don't have the strength to stay away from you anymore."" ""Then don't.""""I hate you for making me want you so much. ""among many such fabulous examples of writing. That said, Bella isn't nearly as obnoxious in the movie as she is in the book, and the movie's over fast enough, so it's not unbearably painful like the 'novel' is. Kristen Stewart gives a good performance, and yeah, Bella's got an attitude and spark in the film that her literary counterpart doesn't, so it works out better in the end. Still a bad film, still loaded with cheese, but at least it's so-bad-it's-good in places and tolerable in others.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Grew on me!,"As an avid Twilight reader, I have to say that for the first 40 minutes, all I could think of was how Summit was absolutely ruining the book. I was so upset that the sequence of events were changed, and that actual moments were shifted and misrepresented to the point that I would have gotten up and left had it not been for Robert Pattinson's awkwardly handsome face. And then, I let go of my attachment to the specifics of the book, and actually started paying attention to the dynamics of the film. It's a very well done adaptation. It's aesthetically pleasing, and is cast very well. The colors are perfect, and the depiction of the awkward relationship between Bella and Edward is at points hilarious, and at other points, poignant. Go see it, if not just to plug into the hype, but to appreciate the differences between the film and the book, and how a film does not need to perfectly copy a book to be just as lovely.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Better than I expected,"Nobody told me that this would have a spy story feel! This much mystery, trying to figure out someone's secret identity, hiding from threats, etc. The romance has great chemistry and you can absolutely understand why they fall for each other. Bella has personality and stands up for herself. Edward is protective. Everyone is well cast and really gets their character. They were exactly what I pictured when listening to the audiobook. This is also a very close adaptation; it changes only what it must and I don't really disagree with any of the new stuff.The cinematography and editing capture both the High School age drama and the tension. A lot of negative user reviews hugely misrepresent this. Best I can tell a number of young men were fooled by the definitely misleading trailer which makes what little action this features appear to take up much more screen time and focus. And instead of simply saying that and engaging with what's actually there they instead misrepresent it. It's also quite disappointing how many of them just behave as if the fact that a Hollywood blockbuster was made that wasn't specifically for them but for teen girls is some sort of personal attack. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
One of the worst movie ever made,"If you can tell by my name, I've seen a LOT of bad movies. I seek them out, for fun, to watch them and write reviews on here. I had no idea Twilight was one of them.In many of the awful movies I watch, at least I get the pleasure of watching stupid characters/actors getting brutally killed by the slasher or something. Unfortuntly, none of that happened in Twilight.Plain and simple, if you are not a 12 year old girl, then this movie is not for you. This movie was ONLY made for 12 year old girls. It really, really sucks. Films like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings may have been made for a certain segment of the population that they are geared for, yet those films still are able to appeal to a wide variety of people because they are so good. Twilight, is utter stupid insipid garbage. If you not a 12 year old girl and you like this movie, you should really just remove yourself from the gene pool and donate your body to science, that way at least you will have served some purpose.The first time I tried to watch Twilight, I only lasted about 17 minutes. I got to the point where Edward and What's her name (I forget, and don't care) see each other for the first time in biology class. WHAT the hell was with that scene!??!?! They just sit there and stare at each other, there is nothing else going on... Oh, it supposed to be so emotional and how they feel.... It's not, its done very, very stupidly and poorly.

Doesn't Live Up to the Hype,"This movie wasn't near what I expected it to be. There are lot of things I want to say, but so much so that I am not sure of what to say.The first forty minutes of the movie felt extremely rushed. I think this is where the director did the worst job. It felt like the first two-thirds of the book was shoved into the first thirty to forty minutes. The acting for the character of Edward seemed almost forced during the first few scenes. Rather than looking like he was bothered by a strong odor, he seemed as if he was going to have a seizure in the school lab.From there the forced romance only got worse. It seemed like in the first ten to fifteen minutes that Edward absolutely hated Bella, and five minutes later he was saving her life. Five minutes after that, he was telling her he didn't want to talk to her ever. Another five minutes go by, and Edward is telling Bella that he can't stay away from her. The entire bond between Edward and Bella that was built over a very long period in the book, could have been missed with a short trip to the concession stand. I would say this has to do with bad directing.The visual FX were also a thorn in the side for this movie. I was disappointed with the way that everything was blurred to make it seem fast. Those kinds of FX worked in the seventies, but I mean come on... I agree with the commentators that said the director needs to watch a few more action films before trying to portray these scenes again. It was almost appalling to see some of the ""high-school computer lab"" FX done in this film.The only reason I even stayed to watch the rest of the movie, is because I enjoyed the book so much. I can only hope that they don't ruin the next few books with the same horrible directing job they did in this one.As for the characters, I believe that almost everyone was wonderfully portrayed. Edward was a good pick, except for he looks like a bean pole in some scenes... maybe a protein shake would help this guy out. Bella did a good job as well, and her expressionless face seemed to be what most of us fans expected. The acting of Edward and Bella both could have been improved if it was less rushed. I believe that the best character portrayal of the entire book was Alice; she was EXACTLY what I expected. She was really upbeat, and ""in your face"" nice. The scene in which she said, ""It's okay Edward! Me and Bella re going to be GREAT friends"", was perfect. Laurent and Victoria were what I would have expected as well. The only character I really had a problem with was James. I was expecting a slightly older, wiser, and more cunning-like character.

Undoubtedly the Worst Movie I've Ever Seen in my Entire Life,"Let me tell you about my own personal experience with the Twilight Franchise. I was in High School when the first movie was coming out. I went to Private School, and it was a 30 minute long commute, and I did not drive yet, so my Mom would drive me and my eleven year old sister in the car (she didn't like being home alone). My Mom and her would talk endlessly, literally endlessly, about the Twilight Books during the Commute for months. It was so boring! So by the time the movie came out, I sadly knew the book front-to-back, and I could easily tell it was a terrible book. So when the movie was coming out, I was thinking to myself: ""That is going to be the Worst Piece-of-Sh*t Movie of the year."" Luckily, I didn't see it in theaters when it came out, but months later, when I had to watch over my younger sister, I was essentially forced to watch her DVD of the movie. So I saw it with her, and boy was I wrong, IT WAS THE ABSOLUTE WORST PIECE-OF-SH*T MOVIE OF AT LEAST 10 YEARS. And on top of that, each movie was also in their own right just as horrible.The Twilight movies are the worst movies I've ever seen. And believe me, I've seen a lot of terrible movies; I've seen Batman & Robin, Baby Geniuses, Catwoman, Disaster Movie, Jack & Jill, and The Last Airbender, even the Garbage Pale Kids Movies. But Twilight is worse than these all these terrible movies combined. It makes me cringe just writing about it now.What do I hate about it? Pretty much everything. The Acting is the worst I've ever seen. I did not believe once that the actors were actually trying to give a good performance. Kristen Stewart is such a bad and annoying actress, and her character Bella is the worst character ever made. She has no personality, only cares about herself, does not change as a character AT ALL, she is weak, she never takes responsibility for her actions, she is overly dependent on all the men in her life, and throws her life away for some guy she has no real relationship with. There's not a single positive or even Meh thing to say about her. Edward is such a terrible character as well, I mean he is only in one mood (Stoic) for the entire saga and because of that has no personality. He is obviously not a 100 year old vampire, or even really a vampire, because he does not act like a 100 year old vampire. He is creepy, he is bland, he is the worst vampire ever. And Jacob, My God, WHO FALLS IN LOVE WITH A NEWBORN BABY?! THATS NOT CHARMING, THATS SCARY AND CREEPY.On top of the bad characters, the story is terrible as well. Stephanie Meyer obviously had no what a vampire was, so she created her fantasy image of one. I don't even call these things vampires, because they are not. Who makes Vampires glitter in the sun? And why do they have X-Men like powers? And why are they Immortal? And why do they not drink Human blood? I don't care what reason they put in there, but a vampire not drinking blood makes no sense. I don't even think the vampires in the movies even have fangs.The effects are terrible, the cinematography is awful, the lighting is the worst I've ever seen, the entire movie is literally blue. The Dialogue is terrible, and I did not believe once, ONCE, that Edward and Bella were in any form of relationship. Their relationship in the movie was so creepy that it is perverted, I mean a 100 year old dating a teenager? Are You Crazy! WHO DOES THAT AND FINDS IT CHARMING?!Okay I've gone on enough, but this movie is terrible. Its stupid, it's boring, it insults the audiences' intelligence, there is nothing salvageable. This is the textbook example of how Not to make a movie. When I have kids, I will NOT allow them to see the movies or read the books. This is a movie nobody should see. I hope it burns in hell.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"OK, but the vamps should have done more cool stuff","I have never read the books, so I can't compare the movie to them, but I'm sure the books are better for them to be so popular. The movie just wasn't worth the hype. It was OK, and it had a plot a lot better than most new films, but it just lacked that oomph.First, it's hard to buy the love story between Edward and Bella when all they do is stare at each other a few times at school and suddenly they are madly in love. Surely more happened in the book. And I thought there was going to be some sort of mystery with the deaths of a couple of people: like whether it was werewolves or rogue vampires. But that was hardly a side plot in the film. And I thought the whole vampire baseball game was a hokey thing for them to do . So much more should have been done with the vamps special abilities, then hitting balls a long ways and climbing trees really fast.Then the climax was Bella on the run from James. She goes back to Phoenix with the other 2 vamps, now how did they get out in the sun? Then she gets tricked by James, and James and Edward have a short fight. I did like the scene in which Edward has to save Bella by sucking out the venom.FINAL VERDICT: If you are not a fan of the books, then this movie probably won't be too appealing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Modern-day vampire story lacks bite,"An insufferable female protagonist and a beguiling yet empty male romantic lead make up this ill-judged teen Vampire flick that lacks bite. Helmer Catherine Hardwicke has fashioned a modern-day Vampire allegory crudely linking burning heterosexual sexual desire to vampirism. This conceit is trite and dated and also surprisingly simplistic. The notion that its two romantic leads are just looking for love in spite of the vampiric element is crudely realised and formulaic and is no different than Romeo and Juliet - yawn.Perhaps stiffled by the novel's limitations, Twilight fails to reinvigorate the Vampire genre and might as well have been released in 1987 given its rural setting and distinct lack of style. By their nature, Vampires reject any notion of sexual desire as mere impediment to their desire to extract blood from humans, but this point escapes Hardwicke's naive film. Furtehrmore, she didn't realise that Vampires are inherently bisexual by nature and the heterosexual love story it uses is as contrived as ever. A missed opportunity.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Not as bad as you might believe it will be.,"Now, I didn't go into this movie expecting much. I expected teen romance, vampires, all that good edgy stuff. And that is what I got- but I had my expectations low, so I think seeing what the movie actually did made like it quite a bit. Now, in reality I would give this movie a 7.5, not an 8, but I decided not to give it the short end of the stick and rate it just a 7, and I'll explain this. I will address the elephant in the room first, yes, it is cringy. Some of the scenes are pretty stupid- and make you laugh out loud when you aren't supposed to. No, it is not a masterpiece. There are some noticeable mistakes, but if you start watching this movie expecting it to be perfect, you're not going to have as much fun as you're supposed to, and you shouldn't even watch it at all. Now that I've addressed that, I'll talk about what I liked in this movie. Now, Bella is a very stereotypical teen movie protagonist. The way she acts, the way she speaks, her attitude, it's all very stereotypical. But, surprisingly, I didn't hate her. I thought she was written with enough care that you wouldn't hate her, even though all signs point to the fact that you should. Now onto Edward. He's a vampire. He's attractive. He does creepy things, but Bella likes him too much to care. Yes, this is all very much foreseen even before watching it, but once again, I don't dislike him. He's not perfect by a long shot- he's flawed for sure, and in the real world, he would probably be in jail. But this is a TEEN VAMPIRE MOVIE. You can't expect characters you can relate to or adore, it isn't fathomable to expect that. Robert Pattinson is a brilliant actor, and I'm completely aware that this isn't his best performance, but it isn't bad. It's good. Robert does well with the materiel he is given, and I applaud him for that. I thought the rest of the Cullen family was fun as well- I'm hoping they'll explore them more in the rest of the series. The side characters were good too, although I can't exactly name any of them, so I suppose they weren't that memorable to me at least? They could've done a bit more with them, but I get why they didn't. They aren't the mains, and they're humans. Yes, Bella is a human, but she is the main, so I know why they explored her. Another good thing about this movie is how it looks. Most of the shots were very clean and I thought the movie looked great in general- even with the very heavy filter on it. In fact, I think the filter compliments what type of movie this is supposed to be. It's supposed to be edgy, and the filter helps give it that look. In conclusion, this movie gets too much flack. Is it amazing? No, definitely not. Is it the horrid piece of film that people will lead you to believe it is? Absolutely not as well. If you go in with lower expectations, you'll enjoy it more. Please, watch and decide your own opinion on this movie. Don't let others sway you.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Girl meets boy under a blood red moon,"Meet Bella. Bella just moved from a warm place to a very cold place. Bella is an outcast - knows no one in the high school she rolls into, doesn't know the town or the people that live in it. Meet Edward. Edward has been living in the cold town for ages and he's an outcast too, but in an entirely different way. When the two of them get together the story starts rolling.Based on a book this film is the first film to be made out of the series of books and I'm looking forward to seeing the next part. I've never read the books and I probably never will, but as a film this one works out pretty well. The growing romance between the two isn't half bad as it plays out and the response of the world around them is believable in many extends.The main characters play their roles correct enough and the general setting of the film feels a bit like a chick-flick but not so bad that it becomes unwatchable for people not falling into that category.

Good...if you keep an open mind.,"I can see how some people might dislike the movie, especially if they go into it with the idea of ""vampire movie"" in their head, because really this is more of a teen vampire romance. The studio did the viewers no real favors by pitching this with a more action-style trailer, because this isn't an action packed movie -- the tension between the characters is everything. However, I went into it, both knowing what kind of movie it was, expecting something so-so and keeping an open mind; and I enjoyed it much, much more than I had expected to.It was fairly fun, quite interesting, and I found some of the slightly different angles taken with the vampires to be intriguing. Some people have complained that the romance angle was predictable, but I think that the differences of the relationship presented by this particular take on the vampire myth really change the dynamic around a lot. There are elements that you could guess, but there are plenty of others that you might not, and a few small twists and ideas made this entirely worth the watching for me.I also found the movie to be quite funny at times, but I had picked up from my wife (who read the books) a few ideas about what was going on under the surface, so I don't know how many of those funny situations would be lost on people who watched the movie without seeing it. However, if you chose to watch this movie with an open mind, and left the idea of ""vampire flick"" outside the door, I think you'd probably enjoy this film a lot.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

romanticism,"This was actually a very good surprise. I was prepared to hate this film. The books appeared as half-baked teen stuff, empty and just made to capitalize on the doors to otherworldliness as Harry Potter defined it to the XXI century: strange beings, odd variations on our real world, and a link to this same world, that makes the story and characters appear as if they could really exist, thus engaging more the audiences to whom this is intended. This Twilight series had an extra dullness that put me away: it revolved on the ""fantasy"" clich√©s, and to that, added the vampire film world. So it was playing safe twice.The one thing that truly fails is the male character casting. Robert Pattinson is a stain here, he has no presence whatsoever. He throws his lines as if he was sitting in a toilet, his facial expression is bloodless, but not in a vampiresque fashion, his pose is artificial, although that works for his character (lucky there). I think they wanted to capitalize the actor who had had a short yet emotional character in the Potter series, and thus attract even more of the audiences of Potter. On the other hand, Kristen Stewart was a nice surprise. I don't know if she'll get out well of the teen movie world, but i'll be wanting to watch new things from her. She was tense in an unstressed way that usually we don't have in such young actresses.But what i did like was the general mood chosen to this film. There is a very sweet and tense sense of romanticism that goes through the film, and that's what really caught my attention. It's a genuinely not corny melancholy, where the growing adolescent feelings between vampire and human take a sweet place at the center of the narrative. Regular readers of my comments know and appreciate such films which can convincingly build and sustain a mood, like an invisible glow which surrounds every element of the film. Wong Kar-Wai is the all-time master of this. So i care about trying to understand what produces such effect. Here i think the first anchor of this mood is Stewart and her controlled, intense performance (i wonder if she learned it from Foster). The second anchor is the cinematography and the very well succeeded choice of colors and sets. But the most important thing is the camera work. The hand held camera in the closeups while the lovers have dialogs are really something of superior class. Editing helps, but how the shots were conceived really works well. Some dialog moments are worthy of some bits of some Lumet's films. That is saying a lot.My opinion: 3/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

I can tell you one thing- you will for sure laugh at this movie- and a lot, and if you like the movie its because this, and because ROBERT PATTINSON.

fangirls will love it....anybody else will want to gouge their eyes out with a spoon,"My wife is a fan of the books so I agreed to go with her to the movie on opening night. What I was not expecting was the horde of swooning fangirls that descended on the small theater in droves. Every time that the ""hero"" would come on screen, I was audibly assaulted by a never ending deluge of OOOOOHHHs and AAAAAAHHs that gave me the almost irresistible urge to pour gasoline on myself and light a match. Even as such, if the movie had been at least engaging I would have been able to tolerate this part of the experience. The acting was dry, the effects were horrible, and some of the lines were the cheesiest things I've ever heard outside of a book store bargain rack full of 1 dollar romance novels. The first time that Bella comes into the classroom and sits next to Edward, he acts like he's about to vomit all over the desk. The ""speed"" scenes where the vampires are supposed to be displaying their super speed looks like they are running on a treadmill with a conveyor belt scene moving behind them.

Driven by heart rather than fangs.,"The vampire sub genre of the much broader class of horror film is one that is very rarely taken as a serious means of delivering drama or characterisation, never mind palpable romance. Twilight, the first of what is set to be a series of films based upon the popular books of the same name, counteracts this popular trend successfully, establishing a world that retains its otherworldly charm and yet still manages to deliver a story that most of us humans will be able to digest. It's a feature that is bound to polarise viewers; those attracted to the vampire complex will undoubtedly be let down by the lack of focus on such, and those repelled by the genre will most likely be the ones to enjoy it. In this vein I wasn't particularly looking forward to my viewing of Twilight ¬ñvampire movies have only very rarely managed to entertain or engage me in the past- but I was pleased to find the experience rewarding, intelligent and fittingly driven by heart rather than fangs.Focusing around teenage misfit of sorts Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) as she moves to her father's cold and inhospitable town whilst her mother goes on a state-wide roadtrip with her new boyfriend, Twilight is first and foremost a character story. Not only is it such, but it directs its attention on a personality that isn't driven by the desire to feast. No doubt, Twilight wouldn't be much of a movie if it didn't feature vampires, but it does well to get the balance right in terms of focus. Where the key involvement between Bella and the cold ones comes into play however isn't through danger or a series of spooky 'boo' moments, but rather through subdued teenage-tinged romance. This key shift in momentum makes director Catherine Hardwicke's movie a much more subtle and slow moving feature than one might expect, and the result is potent in its ability to draw the mind and heart within its tale. Those looking for campy, rudimentary fun best look away; Twilight strives to be a little more than such.What's most interesting about the feature however lies in its unconventional mix of action, drama and romance. Very rarely is it seen that movies with any degree of fantastical or action-orientated elements plays them in the background to the attention-demanding elements inherent within drama and romance. In this respect, Twilight achieves a tone and pacing quite unlike most examples out there; sure enough, the movie would undoubtedly be better off with even less of a focus on the thrills and chills or vampiredom, but one can at least attest to the fact that this small risk for the most part plays off in a refreshing manner that feels natural to the story that it tells.So who exactly are these vampires and what do they want? Well, one group particularly ¬ñthe Cullens- simply chose to ignore their impulses to feed on human blood, and live together outside of town where they respectfully live on a ""diet"" of animal blood instead. One of these comes in the form of Edward Cullen (Robert Pattison), an attractive figure of mystique and animosity to his peers, who, by chance ends up falling for Bella in a strange way. This passion that Edward experiences for Bella plays out as a dualism consisting of lustful temptation and protective love; conflicted by his overwhelming desire to feed upon her, and at the same time convince her of his love, Edward is for the most part the tale's major source of character interest. Bella herself is straight forward, and plays as the catalyst for Edward's eventual conflict, but as a pair the two share a wonderful dynamism that often leaps from the screen in wistful, whimsy and romantic flares of imagery.Part of what makes such moments as powerful as they are ¬ñaside from the performances of those involved- is the potent sense of atmosphere that is created from the meshing of Hardwicke's romantic, otherworldly style and the similarly themed score penned by Carter Burwell. Echoing the dynamism and refreshing qualities of Melissa Rosenberg's screenplay, Burwell's music creates layers of different atmospheres that always propel the feature forward into a realm of its own. There's a distinct prominence of ambiance here too, that brings in less than traditional movie-score instruments to pull the job off and the effect is always interesting to behold. Furthermore, while not quite as daring as one would hope, the photography of Elliot Davis too adds much needed dimensions to the film's body, complementing all other elements with coherency and relevancy to what is being explored within the characters.Granted, there are more than a few missteps that take place within the boundaries of what is for the most part a surprisingly effective anti-genre movie, but one can't help but be slightly distracted when they do come along. Kristen Stewart, although doing a fine job in much of the movie's less emotionally demanding scenes, too often falls pray to a lack of heart; the romance as a result during the middle section of the film feels a little underwhelming and disempowering. This and a slight dive in momentum and focus during the movie's final ¬ñmore action-driven- act constitute what are the only real major drawbacks of the film. Other than this, Twilight is a real treat. Intelligent but emotionally driven with a tone that is at times surreal and yet distinctly human, Twilight achieves what most dramas with less of a fantastical nature only wish they could; sure this isn't high-culture stuff, but that's part of its graceful charm. If there is one reason to see it, it isn't for the macabre themes, the fantasy or the vampires, but rather for the dark romance; Twilight is a rare breed of such that successfully mixes all of the required ingredients in a palpable, character-driven tale of warm sentiment.Written by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
I see nothing spectacular here.,"I finally saw this movie on TV this evening. I never saw it before and was eager to see what the fuss is all about. I was not impressed.

That wig on Lautner was half coming off--you could see right through it. I just thought the movie was stupid, senseless.

All they're missing is a cape.,"I must start this review by saying that I am not the audience for the books of Twilight, so the movie probably wasn't made for me either. Still, I intended to see the film in hopes of it being able to cater to all fans whether they were interested in it because of the novel, or simply wanting to see a good fantasy film about teens and vampires.Unfortunately, the film misses on a lot of what it intended to do to bring in outside viewers and that is a shame because had it done better in some categories, it could have been more accepted by those not interested in reading the books. Nevertheless, it certainly has been a big hit with lovers of the novels, as will the next one which is due in theaters next week. I didn't expect to love it but I had hoped to embrace it as the Romeo and Juliet movie of this generation. The actors certainly help with it there as Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson are both very adequate as Bella and Edward, the human and vampire in love with one another it seems because they like to be alone together. Stewart can be a bit too lacking in emotion at the most emotional times, but still manages to carry the role of a young girl just drifting through life until she meets the dark and mysterious Edward. And as this moody and unpredictable fellow, Pattinson shows he was the best choice not only because he is quite handsome, but also because he has the acting chops to pull off the mood swings and insatiable lust for Bella very few others could. Together, they do have serious chemistry and they will probably be voted years from now as one of the best on-screen couples of the movies.What is missing is the bite, for lack of a better term, of the story. It is a fantasy, but there are some elements that do not make sense even in a fantastical world. For example, why exactly does Edward seem so obsessed with Bella? And why does she return this same sentiment despite the fact that in the first 20 minutes of the movie he flees from her like the H1N1 virus. Perhaps we are supposed to just believe it but I wanted more credence. I also wanted more back-story on the Cullens and their abilities to do what they do. They have super-speed, super-strength, and see visions of the future. All that's missing is the superhero cape. Still, I was unimpressed with how director Catherine Hardwicke and screenwriter Melissa Roseberg seemed to tiptoe around the meat of the story, which lies not in the romance between Edward and Bella, but the why and the how of the situation. To really establish true emotional content in these characters would have lent the movie true credence and given the audience something to care about in these characters. Instead, we just get shots of the two looking at each other intensely and sweeping helicopter overviews of the evergreen forests of Washington.The best thing here, besides Pattinson, is the supporting cast, particularly the kids Bella befriends at her new school. They are funny, goofy and lend a realism to the story the rest of it seems to lack, despite the material. Also, the special effects depicting the vampire superpowers are quite unimpressive. I do hope the new film gives more thought and time to the vampires than just blurring their speed and editing choppily as they scale trees. As books, I am sure Stephanie Myers was able to establish exactly what was needed to believe and feel for these characters. Unfortunately, the transition to the screen loses something in translation and even though it will always remain a hit, I will always wonder if it couldn't have been a hit and something more...",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

"Unless you've read the book, don't go see the movie.","Please tell me the director of this film is not directing the next one. All of her previous movies were terrible, she must be mormon because I don't know why stephanie would let her ruin this movie.The movie is everything that everyone has been saying about it: Corny, unintentionally hilarious, awful dialogue, terrible acting (sorry girls, patterson is no exception, he was just as awful).I think the main problem with this movie was that the directory tried to make it ""audience friendly"" meaning, make it easy for people who haven't read the books. Which is totally stupid because the main fan base is going to be the people who read the books, so why skimp on the material? The movie should have been longer, I felt that by the end of the movie there was BARELY a relationship developed between Bella and Edward. One fan pointed out that they never said 'i love you' once in the entire film. Whoever directs this next movie: you NEED to dedicate some serious time in the beginning of the movie to establishing a strong relationship between bella and edward, seeing as how edward is suppose to be ripped from bella in the next movie. The next director isn't going to get the point across effectively as to how devastating this is for bella unless they spend some time reworking the relationship.So the movie made 70 million? put that toward some freakin' acting classes. Everyone in that movie was TERRIBLE! even kristen stewart did a less than par job. in the movie she's sitting there being like ""i'm not afraid of you"" and she's shaking and looking terrified.Ultimately, there's nothing that can save twilight at this point, whats done is done.

"bad act , bad concept, too much plastic on scenes","As so many new movies its lacking on original story, the act its horrible, makes me to poke on screen , actually i could not watch even half movie, where are those wonderful young actors from 70's or 80's?. Nowadays people consumes every crap they could made for them , a bit of plastic, commercial music, nice faces and its done. The worst its there's actually a lot of people who enjoys these crap movies, and they made 2 more (i didn't and i will never watch them anyway). This looks like juvenile daily soup. Before watching this movie i was watching The Stand by me from 1986, and its a complete different quality, even aged the ''Stand by me'' shows normal and real characters, and younger ones, here it shows a completely bad acting plotting directing that really take me out of serious, cant stand these uninspired movies. From 2000's forward there's less and less movies that i would take a look on theaters , only some animation movies left. I cant understand why the industry is selling the untalented nice looking faces over and over, gives us back real actors please!",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
My Love Language is resisting dining on your flesh.,"When this movie came out in high school, my heterosexual male stoner buddy saw it in theatres ten times.Ten. Times.Each time he'd come out a little higher and a little gigglier than the last, riding on the wave of exhilaration that only comes from watching something so nonsensical that it can only be enjoyed with the help of pharmaceuticals. And yet. Somewhere between viewing four and viewing seven, his language about the movie changed. He started calling the actors by their characters' names. Started mouthing the ridiculous dialogue along with them, started saying things like, ""You know, the baseball scene is actually kind of genius. I mean, they used a Muse song. MUSE!""And thus through self-induced Stockholm Syndrome, my friend became a Twilight fan, one of the legions who obsessively ponder the stares between Bella and Edward. I can only imagine that his method is the only way to properly enjoy this movie, because I, who saw it once completely soberly (viewing number five for him) and without having memorized the dialogue, found so little to redeem this waste of humanity's brain cells that I can barely recount the plot here. I remember that there were a lot of panning (or should we say ""padding"") shots of the Pacific Northwest tree line. There was Kristen Stewart at her glassiest (perhaps she too had discovered that the best way to make it through the script was with the aid of pharmaceuticals?) and most monotone. There was Robert Pattinson, whose character clearly hadn't gotten the memo that all-over body glitter went out with the demise of the 1990s.There was a plot about a girl who moves to a small town, meets the hot guy at school, becomes hot guy's obsession, becomes hot guy's stalking object and then becomes hot guy's faithful lover because of course she does. Gentlemen, to really win a lady's heart, kidnap her at high speed through a forest, take her to a deserted field, and then tell her it is highly likely that you will at some point in your relationship try to kill her and feast on her flesh, but only because you love her scent so much. Then stare into her eyes without blinking for a really long time. Then play some baseball, throw in a ridiculously contrived villain who ALSO wants to kill said lady and feast on her flesh because her scent is somehow like crack to the glittery undead, and a vaguely racist Native American who also wants to feast on her flesh but in a metaphorical sense because her glassy-eyed staring is the most attractive thing he's ever seen, and voila. Gazillion dollar movie.I would say something snarky about that, but it's too depressing to bear thought of. Please don't see this movie.2/10 TL;DR: Unless you're planning on getting very high, or you're one of the Twilight legion of teenage girls who firmly believe unrequited love and unsubtle emotional abuse is the sexiest thing you've ever seen, avoid at all costs.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Movie Review,"Twilight was a decent film. It did not quite live up to the book, but obviously they had to cut a lot out for the film. For die hard fans, it is hard to part with any piece of the story because Stephanie did such a great job of making every aspect of the story interesting and seemingly of utmost importance. In my opinion, the best character portrayals were Kellan Lutz with his character of Emmett and Ashley Greene as Alice. Kellan really brought the character of Emmett alive and made him stand out even though he is not a central character. Kellan reminded me of my own brothers. He did a great job! Ashley was incredible as well. Alice has so many odd little quirks, yet she is fun and lovable as a sister figure for Bella. Ashley got it perfectly. Alice was slightly strange but still someone anyone would love to be friends with. These two actors did an amazing job, and it is worth seeing the movie just to see their work.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

a music-video with holes,"I never cared for the twilight hype, could be cause I am not 14 anymore. So this was on TV the other day and I had nothing better to do.It bothers me, that I cannot stop thinking about this movie. It had potential if it only had been done right. There is next to no character development in this. We never learn why anyone does what he does and thus I have no reason to care for anyone, there are plot holes you could park a truck in, the acting is ""not good"" to be generous and the ""effects"" are cheap.I quite enjoyed the parts when this too long music-video stopped pretending to be a movie, the rest was plain boring clich√©.

Just Plain Bad,"I don't even know where to start...Never read the book but one should be able to watch any movie today (if the movie is worth its weight) without having to do so - heck, Lord of the Rings pulled it off.The casting in this movie was dead awful - I haven't see this many cardboard actors since The Phantom Menace. The direction was equally bad - slow-moving and trying to be all artsy - and the hype centered around this movie is a crime that should not go unpunished. The special effects were laughable as no one's done the ""fast-running/fast-climbing"" thing convincing enough yet. With so much to work with material-wise, it's a shame that people can still muck things up like this. Any one with any creative vision would be able to do more with a cardboard box and some tape.I sat through this 2-hour crap-fest to please the wife, who was not pleased herself with the translation from book to screen. Ashame that they wouldn't give roles like these out to a more deserving and talented set of young actors - whoever picked these two - yikes! Just about everyone involved in this cast was terrible.At least there are some laughable moments in this film - though I don't think they were suppose to be laughable.Any Michael Dudikoff/Chuck Norris/Treat Williams flick has more heart than Twilight.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"To Many Missing Pieces, Overall Still Pretty Good","I'm not one for odd numbers, so the fact that I gave it a 7 means there's definitely a reason.Now I'm a huge fan of the book Twilight. So many things happen in the book that just bring you in and make you want to keep reading and reading because its like a never ending story. I was so excited for the movie since I loved the book so much. But once I saw the movie I found it to be a huge disappointment.Reasons, one the time-line didn't follow the way it was supposed to as it did in the book. I am fully aware that when making a movie from a book you have to leave a lot of things out. But a lot of the things that they left out were vital to the book when knowing the story. There are such things that they left out in the first movie that they are going to have to put in the New Moon in order for people to under the story. Most of which being Carisle and Edwards past.Also I feel as though the movie was trying to focus to much on the relationship between Edward and Bella and trying to make it a ""love story/chick flick"" when really in the first book that's not what its all about at all. In the first movie its about the developing relationship of Edward/Bella and trying to get you to understand/accept it as they do.Also the movie was very slow for about the first half. But finally in the second half it got interesting when the drama began to unfold and the story was actually being told the way it was supposed to be.All in all, I enjoyed the movie. I was excited to see my favorite book put up on the big screen.

8/10,"Twilight is a 2008 American romantic fantasy film based on Stephenie Meyer's 2005 novel of the same name. Directed by Catherine Hardwicke, the film stars Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson. It is the first film in The Twilight Saga film series. This film focuses on the development of the relationship between Bella Swan (a teenage girl) and Edward Cullen (a vampire), and the subsequent efforts of Edward and his family to keep Bella safe from a coven of evil vampires.Over over ten years after its release, Twilight stands as a powerful, darkly stylish depiction of teen female desire. For hopeful adolescents and hopeless romantics alike, this bizarrely quaint love story is a recognizable coming of age story with a fiendish twist. The film is an earnest fantasy set on the cusp of adulthood, just as the way the light falls on everything in your life is changing. I don't blame anyone who wants to linger there for a moment. Even with sparkle vampires.Yes, it's strongly geared to the teen audience, but don't hold it against the filmmakers and go in with any preconceived notions and you'll find it a fun opening chapter of this franchise. Vampires and romance are nothing new, but Twilight gives them enough of a twist to make it interesting and the film delivers enough on that twist to make it far better than its outlying plot makes it sound. It's easy to understand how Twilight became such a phenomenon. Superb treatment of Stephenie Meyer's best seller and two compelling lead performances make this Romeo and Juliet vampire saga into an utterly engaging film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Worst. Vampire. Movie. Ever.,"In short, this is a hugely disappointing experience - more glorified after school special than feature film.It's not bad enough that this is a self-indulgent, vapid waste of time... the story well oversteps poetic license and offers a fully revisionist vampire mythology. If you want to sit through 2 hours of vacuous, spineless teenage romance then this is the movie for you. If you like your vampires as fangless, baseball playing, daywalking ""vegetarians"" - by all means, indulge yourself.As for the rest of you... save your time and money.

Twilight.,"Let me start out by being completely honest: there is NOTHING cool about ginger-haired vampire love stories. Vampires are supposed to kick ass, not make out with random Arizona girls. Since this is more or less the storyline, the book was shall we say, not all that great (not to mention it reads like a badly written high-schooler's essay.) So that should just give you an idea of what I thought of the book.Unfortunately, a friend of mine insisted that the book was simply fantastic, so I read it, and, well, didn't like it. At all. Then, after I had shared my view of the book with her, she insisted that I come see the movie with her. So I did. I wasn't disappointed... but I wasn't expecting much either.Firstly: badly adapted from the book. The book was gross enough, don't make me sit through something even worse. Secondly: not very well acted. Although I do admit, it was probably more the script's fault than the actors' fault. Thirdly: the special effects were just so-so. In this day and age, you really have to step it up to please the masses, and this movie just didn't cut it.All in all, I did not enjoy this movie, and not just for the storyline. Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but certainly far from the best. I know it seems a bit harsh of me to just beat down this movie's credibility without a second thought, and I'm not denying that some people think that both the book and movie were great (why, I'm not sure... but I digress), but it's really not worth that second thought, and definitely not worth the $8.00 it cost me to get in.(On a side note, my friend {the one who insisted that the book and movie would be great} didn't like the movie all that much either.)Twilight earns a 3.4 out of 10.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
This Movie Bites,"Vampires...They have the the ability to turn into bats. They wear long dark capes and have black slicked back hair. They prey on the innocent for sustenance, they...sparkle?Twilight is basically a teenage girl's fantasy brought onto the big screen. In fact that's exactly what it is. Stephenie Meyer who wrote the just as popular book openly admitted that it was inspired by a teenage fantasy she had.So maybe other teenage girls and their lonely moms can relate, but what does that mean for the rest of us? Well put simply, it means that it sucks.Twilight's plot revolves around the idea of a girl falling in love with a vampire that lusts for her blood and somehow this makes her love him more. Sounds stupid doesn't it? Well it doesn't end there.The characters are paper thin, and Edward Cullen and his fellowship of fanged fellows all look like their makeup artists went a little to far with the makeup and not far enough with presentation. Edward himself is someone who tries to be mysterious and longing and Bella, who admits to being average, comes of as nothing more than that, yet her blood must be above average in Edward's opinion and Bella risks her life for his desire, is it because she loves him or is it because she thinks he's awesome for being a vampire? don't scenarios like this happen with teens in real life? It's not him, it's his car...Anyway, about the film. The look of it is about on the same level as a high-budget TV series and comes off as cheap and bland. The CGI effects are some of the most laughable and goofy looking effects seen in awhile. There's one scene where Edward, ""sparkles,"" when exposed to sunlight and there's the running scene that looks highly unconvincing. The sparkles are also a unconvincing part of the story itself. I know these aren't your classic vampires, but sparkling is just lazy.One of the main reasons the story falls on itself is because, Edward says he wants to ""protect,"" Bella, yet creates a constant danger to her. It seems like if he really cared about her, he wouldn't put her at risk, but what do expect from someone who's 104 years old and is still in High School?Twilight tries to convincing and epic, but comes off about as much as a Syfy original and it's weak plot and undeveloped characters come off as un-inspired. It's nothing more than a dumbed down romance and an even dumber fantasy. Unless you're a 13 to 16 year old girl or a lonely mother or grandmother, don't waste your time here.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"Innocent and young "" Buffy and Angel "" Similarity","I was generally excited for this film. With the delay in the release of the new Harry Potter film a market niche was caused. This would not be filled easily it needed to target the same audience as the ""Harry Potter "" generation and to attract even a new audience. This is where twilights success has resulted in. Strangely this film reminded me of a younger "" Buffy the vampire Slayer "" due to perhaps the leads similarities to them. The story is even quite similar girl moves to new town and falls in love with vampire ; its the new Buffy and Angel. But in a way despite the sweet innocent love that is portrayed it works. Without the correct casting it would not of worked so well but casting Catherine Hardwicke and Robert Pattinson as the leads was incredibly clever. Both being not too known and not overly attractive they would create an instant likeness to them by the audience. It is to be noted also that the sets on location and off location are both beautiful but there's a special scene in which Edward plays the piano the lighting , the angle , the mood is just perfect. All in all this has been a success in Ireland and from what i've been reading not far off in other locations. I think its time to pick up the book and continue on ....",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
This movie title should have been called Twilight Torture!,"I would just like to say before I review this god awful movie a huge thank you to all those who hated this and the new one (though I have't seen it I couldn't put myself through the torture again) and gave the films a one star or even a bit more rating. I have hugely enjoyed reading a lot of these reviews that have slated Twilight into the ground and has provided me with lots of enjoyable entertainment. For a lot of you reviewers your comments on saying how rubbish this film was had me in tears of laughter because I couldn't agree more.First off I can understand why a lot of girls like this movie gorgeous Edward played by Robert Patterson sets your heart throbbing yada yada yada and even the special effects though tacky can hardly be surprising for such a small budget and I wouldn't have minded but every other part of this movie rings awfulness so much that it's excruciating.OK well the basic story we all know about the character of Bella falls for Edward and finds out he is an 100 year old vampire and gets sucked into his world and where she meets his family and there rivals who want Bella for there next meal.Unfortunately they don't get her a pity really then I wouldn't have had to put up with her. Now Kristen Stewart can act I know that for a fact from seeing her when she was only 12 and starred in Panic Room with Jodie Foster but in this she is beyond awful. She always sounds somber when talking to Edward and just mumbles her lines as though she dosen't know how to speak. Not that Robert Pattinson another good actor playing the character of Cedric Diggory in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire fears any better. The romantic chemistry between Bella and Edward is about as electric as the relationship between water and fire when it comes into contact just goes out. The acting just feels so forced ""well we'll act if we must"" and the characters are so boring and underdeveloped. It's just left me extremely frustrated and what about the story vampires shimmering in daylight. What trollop came up with that idea?The script seemed to have been written by a five year old and putting it that way a five year old could right a better script and the dialogue is so clich√© and cheesy that it was cringe worthy. It's clear from this film that to call it a romance is an insult and I just got so irritated by all involved and I was disappointed by Stewart and Patttinson's non existent wooden acting which was as wooden as though tree trunks in the woods in the film as they can act but not thisI think the reason this film has done well with girls is that are so focused on gawping lovey dubby eyed at Edward that they don't realise how terrible the rest of the movie is. It is absolutely torture this film, a waste of time and money to have made and seen.Even though I won't see the new one I get sick of seeing the damn books and posters everywhere grrrr!

Robert who played Edward was very pretty and stood out like Edward in the book was meant to, but he wasn't the Edward Cullen i bet most of us had imagined. I would've preferred it if there was no film, because the book was just so good and easy to imagine except it was your own image in your head. I think the film did let it down, but i think the people that hadn't read the books enjoyed it more. Now the book is sold out nearly in every shop near where i live because of this film.When paramore, a band from tennesse did one of the soundtracks, and a video for it which i saw before the film i got more excited.

The movie was unfortunately not as good as the book...,"I'm not quite sure what the target market for this movie was but being a 23 year old woman, i have read and enjoyed all of the Stephanie Meyer books following and including Twilight and was very much looking forward to the films release.Although I very much enjoyed the movie, I will admit to being a bit disappointed as to the special effects used as well as the costume and make up. The Cullens are described as beautiful yet I found them their feature were more unhealthy then supernatural. And the way Edward moves, his motion doesn't seem to flow very naturally, which i found quite off putting.I also struggled to identify with the characters that were cast as Emmet, Jasper and Rosalie. Emmet although described as strong in the book, was to me not one to be wearing such baggy clothes and a sideways baseball hat ; as they clothes are described as tailored, expensive but fitting in. Jasper in the movie looks like someone who should be staring in Edward Scissor hands and Rosalie, who is supposed be the most beautiful blonde the anyone has ever seen, is instead portrayed as someone who's natural hair color is clearly not blonde.Perhaps having read all the books, I had my own idea of what the characters would look like and they way the movie would flow and that is why I am so disappointed by these facets of the film. But perhaps I am not alone in my thoughts.I look forward to New Moon, hoping that the budget will be bigger and the film will be better than the last.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
To Vampires what Barney is to Dinosaurs,"Now, clearly it's not supposed to be ""cool"" like Dracula, but as a film it has no merit, either. Acting is terrible, plot is entirely predictable, anybody who can sympathize with the characters despite the writing and awful performances are just pathetic. The only reason this film has any support is the sad army of lonely teenage girls in the world. I thought it would be funny to watch and make fun of how terrible it was, but it's so bad it goes beyond ""so bad it's good,"" and is just enough to infuriate you, considering anybody reading this, bar none, could have made a better movie.

enjoyable.... if your a adolescent girl,"A seemingly normal but shy teenage girl discovers that vampires exists and falls in love with one only to realize there is more at stake for her affection than she is aware of.Horribly clich√©d with terrible acting and a dull and senseless script. When one conveys emotion through the same facial expression throughout not only this film, but every single one to follow. This film while hugely popular has its niche audience in young adolescence girls. Much of this film is left to be desired, the effects seem mediocre as does most of the film, undeserved of the attention and mindless praise it gets. A different spin on the vampire mythos that detracts from the true definition of what they are supposed to be, having gone on to spawn several less then impressive sequels, i find that these films have its built in audience and largely is not impressive in its clich√©d story, bad acting, horrible direction and overly cheesy dialog. If your under the age of 17 then this is indeed the film for you. For true lovers of vampire films id suggest a dozen others that not only stay true to the mythos of the vampire but do so in a more professional manner.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Get a new director and screenplay writer for the sequels,"I completely agree with the others who, like me, could not bring themselves in giving this film a good review. I understand that budgeting and time doesn't allow for every detail of the book to be written into the script, but surely the the screenplay writer and director could've found a better way to transition from scene to scene without leaving so many holes and gaps. It was so incredibly ""choppy"" that I felt unstable walking out of the theater.The cast chosen was great. I think they are a group of talented, as well as extremely good looking, actors that did a great job morphing into the characters of the book. Charlie was definitely entertaining. Carlisle and Esme - charming. Rosalie and Emmett - great couple. Jasper and Alice - exactly as I pictured. Edward - beautiful and perfect but can relax a bit on the lipstick. Bella - also beautiful but could've added in a bit more delicacy and emotion. If you found that there were awkward moments during the movie, don't blame the actors. It isn't their fault that the director pointed them in that direction.All in all, I'm hoping the remaining books of the saga will be made into films. But the only way I can think of the films actually being good is to find a new director and screenplay writer. They failed to bring life to the fabulous work of Stephenie Meyer.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Love it but oops! we forgot to act!,"I just want to say that i love this film but from a critical point of view here is my opinion. I have never read the twilight saga and to be perfectly honest with you this movie was the first time i had ever, even heard of it! I enjoy watching it however i find it difficult to at the same time. It gets exciting more so towards the ending when it should have made the audience have a rush of adrenaline throughout (not including love/emotional scenes). The acting in it seemed effortless and wooden, the characters acted like they didn't have a background as if they had no personality apart from some exceptions mainly Alice who is one of my favourite characters. I personally feel however that if it weren't for Robert Pattinson being in the film i would have found it slightly unbearable to watch. I am afraid to say that just him being so sexy made it more interesting which seemed to make up for the lack of acting!

Worse than the Already Horrible Book,"I thought the book was bad, but the movie just topped it off. The CGI effects looked like they came right out of the sixties. All of the makeup made the vampires look pasty. And the hair. My God, the hair. It's not natural for hair to look that way! The actors couldn't even breathe life into this shallow plot. There was no chemistry between Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewert whatsoever; they were straining just to look at each other. And whenever they saw each other, they looked unfathomably shocked. Even though there were high expectations for this book, I set my sights lower, and still got disappointed. Most of the fans were complaining about how the actors don't suit the characters (who are impeccably beautiful, I might add), but I was complaining about the overall poor quality. The shots were meant to look shifty and cool, but it only made it seem like the cameraman was having a seizure.

"Not the worst movie in the world, but not that great.","I have read the books before entering the movie theater to see this production with not much hope of it being great. But, in the end, I did end up enjoying certain parts and aspects of the movie.And I should definitely note before I go further...if you are one of those teenage girls who thoroughly enjoyed the book, you will enjoy this movie. Not necessarily because of the acting, but because the movie seemed to try to stay as close to the book (both in terms of the plot, and how it was presented). And of course, there are many gorgeous actors in the movie.For myself, I honestly was not a huge fan of the books, or the movie. Edward acted a lot differently than I thought he would and his acting was a little deadpan at times, but I do believe he did a better job in showing more emotion than his co-star, Bella. She was very pretty, and certainly looks how I imagined Bella to look, but her acting wasn't nearly dynamic enough to pull of Bella's character. She seemed to deliver most of her lines the same way...no matter what the occasion--and she always had the same look on her face.I do give props to a few of the supporting actors who I thought did a great job--such as Bella's father, Carlisle, and Alice. I thought the cinematography was stunning. I would've liked to see more effects, but the film was shot very, very beautifully, especially the scenes out in the forest. Another huge strong point of the movie was the humor. There are a few cute wisecracks that made it a little more enjoyable for me as well.However, the stoic dialogue and the weak acting of the two main characters really offset the strong points of the movie for me. The movie also felt as if it had no real climax--it didn't come remotely close to having as colorful a plot as the series. They also glanced over a lot of the relationship developments in the movie. I won't spoil what happens, but some of the relationships went from hostile to friendly, or uncertain to best friends in a snap with no real depiction of how the relationship came to develop that way.I believe the fact that the movie tried to stay as close to the book may have lead to the blandness of the plot. Most of the book occurred within the minds of the characters, and it's really difficult to show that on screen without voice overs. I think they should have had more dialogue (or at least richer dialogue) between the characters to make up for this. Also, I think they should have depicted the relationship between other characters in the movie besides Bella and Edward. I know the whole tale is about them, but it would've really helped the tension to see where the other people stand with the two main characters and amongst themselves.And again, a huge thing that would've helped the movie is more dynamic acting on the part of Edward and Bella, and showing more of the development of their relationship.So, for me anyway, the movie wasn't painful to sit through, but I would not consider it a good movie. If you've read the books, I think it's worth seeing in theaters, if you haven't...eh, wait 'til it comes out on video. In general, the people who I've talked to who hadn't read the book and saw the movie said it was ""extremely cheesy"" and it ""dragged and felt as if nothing really happened."" But they did enjoy the little bits of humor and the cinematography.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Terrific Leads Steal the Film,"Twilight (2008)** 1/2 (out of 4)Teenager Bella (Kristen Stewart) goes to live with her father in the Northern Pacific and once there she falls for Edward (Robert Pattinson) who turns out to be a vampire. As a 31-year-old male it goes without saying but I'm not the target audience for this film and I'll admit upfront that I haven't heard a single page of any of the books. I'll even admit that I had never heard of this story until it became a box office hit. I really didn't expect too much but I was pleasantly surprised to see that there's actually quite a bit of good things in this movie, although at the same time there are some major problems. The greatest thing the film has going for it are the two lead performers who deliver dynamite performances and really save this movie from being something far worse. Stewart is wonderful as the strange teenager who finds herself in a strange place trying to connect with the father she hasn't seen in ages. She's also trying to fit into a school where she feels like an outsider and she then finally falls for someone who is untouchable in many ways. I thought the early part of the film did a very good job at building up her character and the actress managed to bring it a lot of weight and make her believable. Pattinson is also extremely good and I was really impressed with his laid-back approach. I thought he was very believable as the tortured soul who is caught between love and his own natural instincts. The two stars are wonderful together, have some great chemistry and they come off like a real couple. Director Catherine Hardwicke handles the material quite well but the biggest thing wrong with TWILIGHT is something that haunts a lot of films today and that's the fact that the screenplay isn't strong enough for a 126-minute running time. I'm really not sure how it happened but why on Earth do producer's feel a ""B"" movie needs to runs between two and three hours? The film starts off so well but every scene just gets to the point where it drags on and on and the ending, which you can see coming from a mile away, happens way too far into the story and by this point you're already starting to grow tired. The worst thing in the film is the extremely poor CGI effects, which are among some of the worst that you're ever going to see. With that said, if you're a fan of the books then it goes without saying that you're going to love the film. As someone not familiar with the story, I found the performances to be excellent and they're good enough for those non-fans to check out.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
A point of view of a careful watcher.,"After watching the movie several times,did not want to comment accordingly to the first thoughts, l find the acting of Miss Stewart pretty weak for this role. Obviously she was not able to get into the personality of Bella Swan sadly. Watching her shaking head, hesitant moves and spurts during the whole movie was quite annoying. l wish there was a chance to change the actress for this role for the next movies. Considering the weight of Bella Swan for this one and the next ones, l can say either it will require a crushing work for Stewart or another unpleasant experience for us,watchers. l always support the novel-based movies. Since they usually have stronger screenplay than an average movie. Though this also brings an image about the character in mind for almost all the time. As long as it is not possible to bring the actor/actress onto the screen in your mind, the cast at least have to understand the nature of the role. Sometimes there can be comments like they do not want to be a reflection of the book. They want to be unique. But there are some expectations. There are some specialities ,pointed out in the book,the watcher desires to see. When we can not, here is the Twilight movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
fabulous movie 10 STARS,"I read with a certain amount of sadness the negative comments posted here about this film, and note that most of the criticism pertains to the fact that this movie as one ""enlightened"" critic put it ""has ""woman"" written all over it"". How sad that in this era of supposed female emancipation, that any film that does not cater to the adolescent male need for blood, gore and action, is vilified. This movie is tender, atmospheric and extremely entertaining. It is not another boring special effects movie, a cop movie, a war movie, or any of the other endlessly boring (to me) movies that spewed like bile by Hollywood.A lot of the vampire fans are totally upset because the Vampires in this movie are not out killing people and because they are not the standard gore film Vampires... I wonder what all the fuss is about? Every Vampire film tends to change and modify the Vampire legend. In some movies they are killed just by exposing them to light. In some movies only a steak to the heart can do the job. There really is no standard behavior for Vampires people make it up... because Vampires don't really exist! It's a STORY people.So in my mind it's just that this movie is more poetic and is something ""girlie girls"" of which I am a proud card carrying member, can love. So of course it is despised because I guess all forms of entertainment are expected to cater to males and male tastes.Anyway I loved it and that is the first time I have been able to stand a movie about Vampires.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Dreary,"Oh dear was this dreary! Slow, ponderous and plodding, the minutes ticked away whilst we waited for SOMETHING TO HAPPEN! Okay, it made heaps of money, teenage girls may find it romantic and let's face it..it is a soap, a chick flick, call it what you will but don't tell me it's entertaining! Compare it to so many others of this ilk, even as far back as 'The Lost Boys' when there was nothing like the effects of today, they managed to inject some style and action. Look at 'True Blood' sex, gore, excitement, action, all the things this didn't have. I realise they didn't want a rating that meant young girls couldn't see it but give it some erotic content, isn't this what vamps are supposed to be about? Glamour! For me the actor playing Edward Cullen wasn't even particularly good looking for all the fuss made about him. (Okay, yes I'm a bloke.)

A cheesy bore,"This film is about a teenage girl falling in love with an aloof classmate, only to find out later that he is a vampire.There is a huge craze about ""Twilight"", even my friends who are not into popular culture talks about it. After watching ""Twilight"", I declare that I do not understand what the fuss is about.I find the plot very slow and boring. The characters often state the obvious. When they are not, they say ultra cheesy lines which make me laugh because they are so bad. There are many obvious plot holes which shows that the script is poorly written. For example, I find it hard to believe that the vampire residence is full of glass walls which allows maximum sunlight penetration. There are a few other obvious ones that I spotted, but I will not reveal them here.I don't find the film thrilling, touching or romantic. I am not among the target demographic, maybe that's why I find it a cheesy bore.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Twilight thoughts,"I watched the film prior to reading the book. I watched it thinking it would be some crappy, mystical rubbish because my friend wanted to see it. It got my attention from the first second. The style of the film was encapturing, the ""quiet"" feel to the acting drew me in completely, it was true directing talent. I don't know what people are saying when they can emotionally connect with the screen version of Edward Cullen. I don't think I could connect so well in the book, had I not seen the film. As for the character of Bella, she cannot think on screen, therefore some element of her would inevitably be lost, but it has been managed to the extent that you can understand and feel the love they share.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Nowhere near as bad as the rating suggests,"I had never had any inclination to watch this film, however it was on TV and with nothing else to do I thought i'd give it a go. I wasn't expecting to like it but found myself getting involved in the story. The acting was so so but there was a certain chemistry between Pattinson and the beautiful Kristin Stewart. It is clearly aimed at the girl market but what's so wrong about that. I see that it has a poor IMDb rating but this is based purely on blokes voting it a 1 without seeing it, a clear case of voting snobbery. The film was entertaining throughout and well worth a view, as long as you are prepared to suspend belief and enjoy something for what it is rather than how cool you think it is to dislike it. I for one will be watching the sequels.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
twilight.......,"OK so I finally saw twilight on DVD last night and I can tell you that it was an Okay adaption of the book.But I gotta say I had more problems with the movie than good.1) MY first problem was the first time Bella met Edward in the lab, where she sat next to him and he's making these funny faces and covering his nose, I mean is Bella really pose to fall in love with this guy practically insulting her, I mean in real a person doing that you would more look at him as a jerk.2) My second was that Edward is basically in the movie forcing his way to talk to Bella and then he says something like ""we can't be friends"" and then he walks away from her and Bella was like OK we were never really friends we just talk normal like everybody else. So Bella doesn't really take it on and the next day he approaches her again and is like hey we should talk , is like he's stalking her or something, it was just funny the way he did it in the film.3) When Bella confronted Edward on being this vampire, that whole scene drag for me, I mean its like OK we get your ah vampire how many things does he have to prove he is, he's lifting up branches and flying all over the place and the girl already said she's fine with it.4) Probably my final problem was the story beside the love story, where there's a bad vampire that we don't really know where he came from and he wants Bella and Edward is gonna do is best and protect her he quoted ""you are my life babes"", alright it was ah nice touch other than the love story however they really never explain the consequences of Bella and Edward relationship, i mean he is immortal and she's not so he doesn't age but she will, how will that work out between them, she could move on to college while he stays back and lives forever and moves on to another 17 yr old girl which he falls in love with. Bella in the movie never even asked the guy well in you 100 years of living how many girls have you dating, seduce or fall in love with.So those are my overall problems, I may have more but I'm enjoy watching the movie home instead in the cinema, however i kinda interested in new moon because it should be updated, the movie made millions on its average bud-jet so new moon should have better effects and stuff. I have to compare this movie though with another love story um that is ""A walk to remember"" now i don't like Mandy Moore that much but A walk to remember is ah much better love story than twilight, both movies have similarities, A walk to remember features an awkward teen girl and a douche bag guy and yet their both likable and the relationship is endearing and i just didn't feel that way about twilight as i was hoping for.To the people who love twilight and hasn't seen A walk to remember i recommend you watch that movie, you might like it as much as twilight.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Lifeless -- And Not In a good Way,"""Twilight"" is a flatfooted, pedestrian, earthbound, dull movie. Which is odd, because it's about a teen girl who falls in love with a vampire. I mean, ""The Exorcist,"" about a teen girl who turns into Satan, was so incredibly exciting, scary, controversial. Is this movie so bad because Hollywood underestimates the intelligence of teen girls? Hollywood cranks out blockbuster after blockbuster for teen boys, all with huge budgets, innovative art design, and high production values. ""Twilight"" is a dull little trifle that could have been shot by an amateur cast and crew with hand held cameras. The soap opera, ""Dark Shadows,"" had more going for it than this. In fact, skip this non-entity and watch ""Dark Shadows"" on youtube, or ""Death Takes a Holiday,"" starring Frederic March. That handled the ""young girl wants to have intimate relations with really bad boy"" so much better than this movie does.Not much of anything happens. Kirsten Stewart is Bella. Stewart may have given the single most annoying, PMS, chronically depressed and droopy teen girl performance in film history (and that's saying a lot). Even in a scene meant to be romantic, where her boyfriend plays piano for her, she has a look of vague disgust and catatonia on her droopy face. Be honest ¬ñ don't you just want to slap some life into this chick? At her high school, Bella stares at a guy named Edward. Edward is very pale, wears heavy lipstick, and tweezes his eyebrows. By staring at him, she falls in love with him. Nothing happens between them before she falls in love. No witty repartee, no heroic deeds, no sharing of day to day life, no thrilling, teasing competition to see who wears the pants in the relationship, no heartwarming discovery of shared interests and goals. She just stares at him, and that's it. So much for sweeping us off our feet.Edward and Bella have endless, dull, flatfooted conversations. ""Oh, you are a vampire."" ""Yes, I am a vampire."" ""Do you drink human blood."" ""No¬Ötofu metaphor."" I wish she had AT LEAST asked for recipes.No mystery. No magic. No imagination. No cool special effects. No haunting evocation of the wilder, darker side. Just the most boring, lifeless ¬ñ in all the wrong ways ¬ñ movie.Teen girls, please don't be satisfied with these crumbs Hollywood is tossing you.

"like, omg, like, this movie sucked","I went to see this movie with my girlfriend (we're both 23). I love vampires, I have an astounding infatuation with them...so, I figured ""why not, it seems like it may be a pretty decent movie."" I got the full shot, on opening night...seemingly hundreds of adolescent girls screaming every time a male character appeared in a scene. And THAT, folks, is the entire point of making this movie. These books have fairly recently become a phenomena, and someone decided it would be a wonderful opportunity to make a barely mediocre film about it and just rake it truckloads of cash. Well, I believe they achieve their goal with shining success. As far as the film goes, there is no substance, the acting is teen-drama level, special effects are just...not right...for some reason, never quite figured out why. I basically thought that this movie was terrible, and could be made into a wonderful film given a different...well everyone! If say, someone like a Tim Burton would have done this movie, it probably would have been astounding. Unfortunately this movie doesn't deliver on the vast potential the story has. We could have had passionate and sultry vampire goings on within a wonderfully Gothic /classic American setting, but what we get instead is a mountain of teenie heart-throb stuff, and vampires never looked like they'd fit into a Norman Rockwell painting so well..

Eh..,"I went to the midnight showing of Twilight, I liked it but i wasn't in love with it. I have been obsessed with Twilight ever since the first day i read it, and have imagined it as the epic love story it truly is. Edward fights for Bella, and they fall into a forbidden love. This movie took the book and played it into the movie, but didn't show this love in the true way it should be showed. They took the ideas in the book, but put them into a whole different way, they made it funny, and some of the parts seemed way to scripted, not the way a teenager would talk or act. Also, they added parts into the movie that were never in the book, and some parts seemed too scripted. I had high expectations for this movie, and maybe that is why I am disappointed.

So much hype for another 'teenage high school' film,"Twilight is based on the books by author Stephenie Meyer, about a teenage girl that risks everything when she falls in love with a vampire. This movie has received a massive amount of hype and has quickly formed a cult like following. Being a big time Buffy and Angel fan, it is hard to not see the similarities between this movie and the TV series, minus a vampire slayer of course. One of the things that always drew me to the Buffy TV series, was their ability to still take a comedic approach at the vampire scenario. Whereas this movie was so serious at times and seemed to change the 'rules' when it comes to vampires (such as allowing them to stand in daylight and instead of burning into flames, their skin becomes diamond-like which seems odd?). I am probably just being picky, but it really didn't do much for me and just seemed like another 'teenage high school romance/drama' story. Having said all of this, I can see how this would appeal to so many (plus I haven't actually read the books) so feel free to make up your own mind. It still was entertaining enough, I suppose I am just surprised by the level of hype surrounding this film. My Rating: 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Pretty Awful,"One word to sum up this movie: Abortion.As an author, Meyer is decent. Obviously a book targeted toward teenagers. To be specific: raging hormonal teenage girls. But, I enjoyed the book. Girl falls in love with guy, guy falls in love with girl, guy is a vampire and wants to kill her and almost does... it's all good stuff. Reading the books, I understood what the hype was about. The movie earned ten times as much hype and after watching it tonight, I thought out loud: Whose idea was it to make this movie and where do they live so I can shoot them in the face?From start to finish, the movie was terrible. A slew of problems everyone in the audience could see. Even the die-hard teenage Twilight readers (who proudly wore 'Team Edward' shirts) laughed at the movie. The biggest problems: the director (Hardwicke) and the screenplay (Rosenberg). Hardwicke's biggest films were Lords of Dogtown and Thirteen. Rosenberg's biggest contributions were to the fabulous movie Step Up, the amazingly intelligent TV show The O.C. and don't count out a production credit on the long running , brilliant TV show Birds of Prey. Oh, and yes, I'm being sarcastic. Put these two in charge of steering novice (but earnest) actors such as Pattison and Stewart and you have an absolute disaster.Honestly, did anyone read the book before yelling 'ACTION'?",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
This film is amazing,"This film is gripping. They should definitely make the entire series in movies, especially after the cliff hanger at the end of the movie.

The film is aimed at teenagers but people of all ages and sexes will enjoy. The film has also got more than one genre as well so people who don't particularly like love stories like myself will still like the film. Overall I will say this film is very good.

The story is very simple really.. it's about a girl who falls in love with a vampire and the vampire in turn must resist eating her.

"Similar to the book, unfortunately","I've been a fan of the Twilight series for years, and as I've moved on to the classics I've decided that the essence of the Twilight series is that it's entertaining and endearing rather than well-written.The movie, Twilight, just brought out that aspect for the masses. Stewart played Bella very flat, but the Bella in the books wasn't all that dimensional anyway. Pattinson, who I first thought wasn't a fit for the the role, played Edward very close to how I imagined he would: intense, emotional, a loner, slightly controlling-sounding at times. I believe the rest of the cast was picked very well appearance wise, but there were several parts of the movie that you just cringe because of the bad acting. Pattinson and Stewart has some kind of chemistry, sure, but I'm not sure how much of that was motivated by their pure awkwardness toward each other. Sometimes endearing, usually overly dramatic and emotion, Twilight is a good movie to watch to motivate you into reading the classics or hey starting a countdown to the first showing of Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

lame...,"It was hard to believe my eyes.All my class has been talking about that movie for weeks and when i finally saw it , i just felt that i badly need fresh air outside the cinema.Still i pulled myself together and stayed to the end.I must admit that i haven't read the book but many things about vampire nature surprised me.First i found out that on sun light vampires sparkle better than just-cleaned bathroom...and they have no teeth so children better throw away your vampire teeth for the next Halloween, you don't want to be out of date don't you.The so called romance was terrible, i don't know why but i didn't feel one bit of real emotion, they didn't even kiss normally (don't count the final kiss).Now about the white faces, it's OK for the vampires they're dead anyway but the whole high school was like some kind of Nazi-Gothic heaven.Some might say this was the rainiest town in the country, yes but that white color of theirs is just like ill(or dead) person O_o. The acting was wooden few times but after all I've said it was supportable.Unfortunately the storyline wasn't.The whole idea of vampire-human relationship is quite familiar to the public (at least to me) and the end was confusing i mean i really though he will bite her and they'd live happily ever after.I really hope that the book is better.my score 3/10",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"Very well adapted, great cast - Thoroughly enjoyed it.","As a fan of the books (I always like to mention that I'm a 20 year old guy, to show that the demographic isn't solely teenage girls), I was very pleased when walking away from the cinema. There was a good, yet delicate, balance of humour and action with the romance taking up a fair proportion of the movie; as was the intention if you've read the books. I attended the screening with 4 friends who also thought it was enjoyable. Bearing in mind none of them had heard of Twilight before now, I thought their thoughts were fair.In my opinion, the casting was perfect. Whilst the girls in the audience swooned after Edward (Robert Pattinson), I was fixed on Rosalie (Nikki Reed) and Alice (Ashley Greene). They are stunning. I believe the chemistry between Pattinson and Kristen Stewart (Bella) was spot on; this no doubt may have something to do with their apparent off-screen romance whilst filming. Good luck to them.Fans of the books will notice a few added scenes (no more than a few however), and also that Bella's narration has been adapted to set the scene, when the film can not do so. It's always going to be difficult to convey so much emotion between two characters when all you can do is watch, therefore the narration is necessary and I believe is very effective.All-in-all, it was a great movie. Granted, it's not for everyone, however it seems that we live in a world where everyone is a critic so it's always nice to see good reviews on the internet for once.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
review by someone who didn't read the books,"i went to see this movie opening night with my gf and my roommate who have both read the books. (one of them several times) i have heard them both talk about the books but i never read them. one more thing i should point out is that i am a guy, and this movie is obviously geared for the ladies.with that said, i liked the film more than the book-read friends that accompanied me. and not because i thought the movie was well made or that the acting was that great. the movie was funny intentionally, but funnier when it was supposed to be serious. that is why i enjoyed it. i understand that the book is from bella's pov so a lot of the story is thought not said, but kristen stewart overacts to a point of hilarity at times. the side cast is also hilarious. and when edward first ""smells"" bella, the whole theatre cracked up. i can't help but compare this to ""bring it on"" and its several sequels. (note; i liked bring it on...)all joking aside- as a movie, the timing is terrible. the romance is very rushed when it shouldn't be, and drags on when it could have made the point and moved on. the cullen family is pretty ridiculous, in fact, most of the script is cheesy and totally unrealistic, and the action scenes leave something to be desired. character development is absolutely abysmal. and like i said, although this can be said about most movies based on books, the whole film felt rushed. and like i said before, i cant help but to compare this to ""bring it on"" as far as the age range this was targeted at.on the bright side there was Alice, but she was not used to her full potential.so basically... it wasn't terrible, but it could be a whole lot better. i see the appeal, but it wasn't executed well.so, what professional wrestling is to 13 year old boys, twilight is to 13 year old girls. it doesn't have to be ""the godfather"" for it to not have a following.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
I am now addicted to Twilight,"I never read the book twilight, but watched the movie...and now all I can say is I loved it. As soon as I was done with the movie, I went and bought the book ""New Moon"" I can't get it out of my head....I think I am obsessed. I can't get the story out of my head. And people say it is a teenager movie...I am no teenager. I don't understand how there could be so many bad reviews of this movie. I have watched it 3 times thinking to myself, maybe I just wasn't thinking right and it wasn't as good as i first thought...but no, I am really truly addicted to these characters.

By far the worst movie I have seen since Mr. Wrong,"I read the book and was so excited to see this movie, but was utterly disappointed. With in the first ten minutes I wanted to get up and leave. The special effects were cheesy, the running scenes were not what I would have expected to see, and seemed more cheesy than unreal.The characters never seemed to be natural they all seemed like they were being forced to say what they were saying and just awkward to watch. Edward looked constipated through out the whole film and it was just uncomfortable to watch. It did follow the book's storyline very well with some parts left out as usual, but the worst acting ever! I would not recommend seeing this movie, read the book instead.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Not worth the $12. (**SPOILER ALERT**),"Where to start? The stark disappointments for leads? The ""this has to be a joke"" cinematography? The overall bland and uninteresting quality of the film as a whole? I mean, when I saw Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson in the promo pics and the few relatively dialogue-less trailers for the movie, I was satisfied. They both got the look down (despite my personal distaste for Pattinson and his unruly physical appearance in real life), that was for sure. However that was really the extent of it. Though Pattinson was passable, Stewart was the big disappointment. Here she is, playing the lead heroine of the movie - someone who, no matter what the level of accuracy in relation to the book, is a fundamentally genuine, sweet, semi-naive and kind of socially awkward character. I didn't expect the movie to be exactly like the books or that it would follow every detail in them; I understand the limitations and difficulty of transitioning books into movies. And honestly, I thought the script was immaculately written for the big screen. There, I was impressed. HOWEVER, don't cast a girl who fails to grasp the essence of the character she is supposed to play and portray it convincingly. I'd rather have a girl who didn't quite resemble Bella as well physically, but who could embody the character sufficiently, over the opposite. Stewart's incredible awkwardness throughout the film that, though sometimes fitting with the character (in very few moments), was just overdone. She walked a very fine line between shy/awkward and awkward/bitchy. And never in the whole Twilight series (and a part that undeniably should have translated in the film) would you EVER think Bella is bitchy.More oftentimes than not, in situations with movies like these the supporting cast seem to outshine the leads in terms of characterization and performance. The only exception was James, who totally didn't step up to the game. Which was a big bemusing to me after seeing Cam Gigandet's performance in ""Never Back Down"" He never provoked a single hair to rise in alarm. He just didn't scream 'Death Threat! Death Threat! DANGER!!!' to me. I was never worried after he showed up in the movie. They should have chosen someone who could really pull off being a supremely evil and sadistic villain. Another disappointment to add to the list. (As a semi-related-but-not-really side note: Bella's friend, Jessica, was ridiculously HILARIOUS. A fabulous comedic relief character. I just loved her! Wasn't exactly like the book, but who cares? She was just adorable!)Now, one of my favourite characters in the Twilight series ... Jacob Black. I wasn't sure, when I saw Taylor Lautner cast as the wonderfully passionate ""werewolf"", if he could step up to the part. He really didn't look anything like Jacob to me. But I was pleasantly surprised. No, he's not identical to the Jacob I envision when I read the books, but who cares? That's never going to happen anyway. He did do a great job building the character with what little screen time he had, managing to slip in his little crush on Bella and that ice-cold glare at Edward at the end in like the total 15 minutes he was probably on the screen for. I look forward to seeing how he develops the character should the movie continue into a series.But off of the casting and what REALLY bugged me about the movie. The filming itself failed to do any justice to the fabulously-written script. I really REALLY strongly believe if you're going to do a 360 shot around characters, you need a really really REALLY good reason to do it, and you can only do it once (sans flashbacks, maybe). That being said, the horribly executed, overdramatized 360 shot that I noticed in particular during the woods scene was just pointless and unprofessional. Not only that, they did waaay too many over-30-degree shots (for those who are unaware, what I'm referring to is when you make cuts in the same scene and the angle of the following cut is more than 30 degrees away from the original angle. Take my word for it, there's a reason it's a rule in media arts not to do it - it looks messy and awkward, not unlike the 360 shots.) Overall, the cinematography itself looked like a low-budget emo band's music video. Also, can I quickly mention, the soundtrack was so ... bad. Like actually. The only song I like from the movie soundtrack is Paramore's 'Decode' and that one didn't even come on in the film. The songs were random and completely unfitting and took away from the scenes and movie in general.Overall, I give it like a 5 out of 10 stars. I was unentertained throughout most of the movie, and the only reason I finished it was the hope that there would be a turning moment where I'd go ""Oh. Well that was worth it."" And as a fan, I just needed to see the whole thing. Disappointment, the repetitive word I keep returning too, is the sum of it. Worst of all, the excess cheese they put into some scenes (like where Edward 'exposes' himself to Bella in the sunlight and then they lie in the meadow and stare at each other - gag me NOW.) never for a second convinced me that this was an eternal, true, binding, timeless love ... it felt like two actors feebly attempting to play it out that way. And that's just the worst thing for a movie to ever allow.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Kristen Stewart,"Kristen Stewart was beyond horrible.The role of Bella was totally mis-cast, and that ruined the entire movie! How can you miscast the main character? She's a lousy actress to say the least.She put no emotion into her role.She STUNK! Additionally, the director didn't not put enough thought into this movie.It was like he just tried to ""hurry up"" and get it into the theaters as quickly as possible.If he would have taken more time, made the movie a bit longer (only if he would have followed the book more closely), then, and maybe then, I would have given this movie a higher rating. But again, Kristen Stewart totally ruined Bella. Instead of bringing her to life. She KILLED HER COMPLETELY!",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Mediocre,"It seems the entire population of Twilight viewers have either an unhealthy obsession , or have chosen to reject it and start anti-Twilight discussions. But really, Twilight is not worthy of either of those things.Twilight is a decent, tolerable film, however, whatever charm the book possessed that made it so interesting has been lost during the making of this film. The biggest problem with Twilight is the character, Bella. The initial character had about as much emotional depth as a teaspoon; she was barely even a character, more so a mate created to love Edward. Nevertheless, with her narration in the books, we are forced to relate to her to a certain extent. Whatever personality she may have had was completely pulverized by Kirsten Stewart. Bella is so unenthusiastic and uninteresting, we have to wonder if she even has a brain, or why her classmates want so badly to be her friend. She expresses very little emotion, and comes across and as careless and conceited. Her lack of character provides an opportunity for the infatuated girl audiences to see themselves as Bella to satisfy their fantasies of having the 'prefect man' (Edward).Robert Pattinson was a likable Edward. He took his own turn with the role, and came out with a quirky, almost awkward character. Despite some of his painfully cheesy lines, he did well. However, the couple's supposed ""love"" for each other is shallow, and not quite believable.There are a few touching moments between Bella and her father, and a few laughable moments as well. And as far as the directing goes, the film was beautifully shot. All of this combined with some cheesy dialog an poor special effects creates a somewhat enjoyable, yet forgettable, mediocre film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
A little disappointment,"I went into the theater expecting a cheesy, melodramatic, low-budget film adaptation with little resemblance to the plot of Twilight. It was a little bit better than I'd thought.Don't get me wrong, Twilight fans, I am completely with you. I LOVE the books and obsessed over this movie for months before it came out. It's almost painful for me to admit that this movie didn't live up to it's full potential when I really was hoping that it would.I'll start with the bad things. The film was lacking some of the wittier quotes from Twilight that I had really hoped to see portrayed by Rob and Kristen. The way that the vampires moved was beyond cheesy; it was pathetic. The way Edward talked at the beginning was awkward and melodramatic. Oh, and Catherine Hardwicke completely robbed Twi-hards fans of a proper meadow scene. Bella's instant belief in the supernatural is laughable. Edward and Bella's relationship seemed rushed, and if I hadn't read the books I would not understand how two teenagers who have spoken to each other about three times can decide that they want to risk their lives to be together. And Edward sparkles ALL WRONG!!!! OK, so the film had it's issues, but it could have been much, much worse. Even though some great quotes were taken away, a few really funny ones were added. The cast was amazing. They could not have picked a better Edward, Bella, Alice, Emmett, Rosalie, Esme, Carlisle, and Charlie. I have to admit that though they got the type of Volvo wrong, Edward's driving is fantastic. There were a few very funny, unexpected parts. The movie was pretty close to the book.So here's a summary: this movie could have been much better if they took 5 minutes to add the quotes twilight fans crave or just to develop upon the Edward-Bella relationship. It also could have been worse. I will buy this movie on DVD when it comes out. If you're a Twiilight fan, go see the movie and decide for yourself. If not, just skip it.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Good work,"I think Kristen , Rob and Catherine did a very good job. You can't put all of the novel in two hours of film. Rob and Kristen are amazing as Bella and Edward. They are very compatible and you can feel the emotions and the chemistry between both. I hope all books comes on the big screen . And don't forget it was a low budget film. And all are very, very young actors at the beginning of their career.They still need to gain experience. I'm sure they gets better and better with each part of the saga. I'm an absolute fan of the saga and the film . And I think that it's a really good film to enter the world of love and romance dive. The world is cold and hard enough for something of this nature will not hurt anybody.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"Wonderful plot for a film, but this version missed the mark.","It's really a shame because this movie had SO much potential, it surfaced with an already dedicated fan-base, the actors cast were promising, and the plot line was unique. Such a combination of potential is a rarity, making the shortcomings of the film all the more disappointing.The love between Edward and Bella was far too rushed, to the point it was unrealistic, immediately leaving the audience detached from their romance, and unfortunately ruining the dynamics for the rest of the entire film. This was especially disappointing because Twilight is supposed to be a LOVE STORY. The author has even said her inspiration to write the book came from the play Romeo and Juliet, obviously the romantic aspect is a huge reason for why it has been so successful, and the films failure to properly convey the romance partially explains why it's such a flop in comparison. Crucial character developments from the book were completely omitted in the film, and the melodramatic music and poor quality ""blue tinted"" lighting instilled a creepy and suspenseful feel, not a romantic one.The actors should almost be embarrassed for having the title on their film resumes. I feel bad for knocking Kristen Stuart for her pitiful performance, because the Bella Swan in the book seems she would be an incredibly difficult character to convey, but Stuart's delivery was much worse than one would have expected, every single line of hers sounded contrived, and her performance removed much of the film's potential. She was perfect looking for the role, and that's pretty much it. As for Robert Pattinson, while his role was awkward and rushed, he deserves to be commended for his wonderful performance, there's not much one can do when he's given an awful script.All in all, the film was rushed, and literally laughable, the audience giggled in awkward embarrassment during the emotionally tense scenes, partially because of the contrived emotion in the lines the actors had to rehearse, and partially for having spent money on such a god awful film.I highly recommend Twilight, the book, to anyone and everyone, but the film is only worth seeing for those of us who have already read the novel, and even then I wouldn't completely recommend it. I would look forward to enjoying a cinematic version of Twilight, the book truly deserves it's own film, and it would translate nicely, but this particular cinematic translation of the book did not hit the mark.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Not a good representation of a slightly above average book,"Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of Twilight series (well, at least the first book), but this movie did nothing for me. I think the filmmakers largely missed the mark in some of the casting-- Robert Pattinson's acting ability was sub-par. He never delivered his lines with any credibility. And I'm not sure if it is the fault of the screenwriters or whomever, but Edward (at least in my estimation), was supposed to be smooth, eloquent, and confident, not stumble over his lines and seem at a loss for words. The cinematography and soundtrack selection was all a bit (okay, a LOT) too obvious, and I felt pandered too as a viewer. Give the audience a chance to think!",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"All bad, all the time","I can review this with unbiased as I have not read any of the four massive tomes-for-books that this movie is based off of.Now, it's been some time since I've seen this movie, I am just now thinking of the words to review it. My forty-six year old MOTHER bought this movie since she loved the books. And I was a little iffy about it since the internet communities I frequent, were not fans. (Though, many of those same people just hate stuff for the sake of hating stuff).But finally, one day, I mustered up enough boredom to watch some of it.I was already unimpressed within the first 30 minutes. So much so I had to STOP watching the atrocity and find something more amusing to do. Like watching golf, or something. But a week later, I got bored enough to finish watching it.Severely not impressed. First off, the leading character was massively pale herself and would have been confused whether or not SHE was a vampire, if I didn't have some minor outside knowledge already. The confusion didn't end there as she gets a crush and falls in love with this completely emotionless vampiric character.The massive pitfall of this movie is when I saw that these vampires SPARKLE in daylight. Are you F-ing kidding me? That's their major curse? Their ""Skin of a monster? (Edward)"" Are you SERIOUS. Did the author of the books purposefully NOT research common vampire lore? Now, I don't mind a twist and a change here and there, and I especially don't mind day-walking vampires... But that is such a pointless and, forgive me, RETARDED 'twist' on vampire lore. Completely unnecessary.And then, the cheesy and unrealistic ""speed"" effects the movie gave. No mention of logical force of movement or momentum. Nothing.The only times I liked this film were all the times the vampire characters WEREN'T even on-screen. I liked the storytelling and characterization between Bella and her father. I must admit, I did like that (I'm a sucker for character development).The second thing? I must admit, the final fight scene was well done. Even the aftermath just seemed to be acted better.I could nitpick but really, there's no point.

Book fan,"I LOVE the Twilight book series! I am not impressed by the movie AT ALL! First of all, the characters were bad actors in general. The actors who played Edward and Bella did not portray like they were in the books. In the book, Edward Cullen was mysterious, charming, intelligent and spoke with early 20th century eloquence. In the movie he was awkward and creepy. Bella was a ""Plain Jane"" type both in the book and movie, however her personality was definitely not portrayed accurately. The movie left out so many of the best parts of the book! It seemed rushed. One minute Edward is a freak, the next Bella is in love with him. It combined several of the scenes where the two got better acquainted with one another into one awkward, unrealistic and rushed scene. It didn't even portray the ""meadow scene"" right and that was the inspiration for the book! The scene in the trees was weird too, because that never happened in the book and it didn't make sense to me, because Edward's character was so protective of Bella. I just don't see him taking her to tree tops... Anyway...I truly hope that the next movie will be pleasantly and surprisingly more accurate...but I doubt it. I am truly shocked that Stephenie Meyer was satisfied with this adaption of her books...",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"""Twilight""¬Ö  An Objective Review from a 22-year-old male¬Ö  It wasn't the train wreck I was expecting¬Ö  But it was still flat and uninspired","About a year ago, I found myself unable to sleep one night, while visiting a relative. In my desperation to occupy the blank void of wasted time, I began searching his Video On-Demand channels¬Ö and there it stood, screaming at me: ""Premier: Twilight on Demand""! I'm not familiar with the books, but I know the basic story- sappy, pouting boy and girl fall in love¬Ö boy turns out to be vampire¬Ö assorted shenanigans ensue. I also know the films are met with very mixed-to-negative reception critically despite their booming popularity to the young female market. So, I had to take a dive into the pool of estrogen and sappy dialog, if for nothing more than to understand why this darned series is so popular, and why I can't swing a dead cat without hitting something ""Twilight"" related.And my feelings are surprisingly contradictory¬Ö the film was simultaneously better and worse than I had imagined.""Twilight"" is directed by Catharine Hardwicke, a director whom I have the mixed feelings for, as I felt her film ""Thirteen"" had good intentions, but fell into the trappings of a cheap exploitation flick, and in the end was little more than a feature-length Mtv reality show. And I felt it mainly had to do with amateurish direction on her part, and a lack of focus. So I already had that against ""Twilight""- I assumed the filmmaking would be of just-as-""meh"" a quality as she displayed before. Surprisingly, Hardwicke was, for the most part, a capable director in her handling of the material. Granted, the scenes of suspense and action were poorly done (the climax was rushed and at times it was impossible to see what was going on), and some of the dialog sequences fell flat, but on the whole, I feel she has grown as a visual artist.The acting was adequate for the leads. Just adequate. On the whole, Robert Pattinson did an OK job as the heartthrob vampiric lead; though he did feel like a creep and a stalker too much- guys who behave like him likely wouldn't get the girl¬Ö It's different seeing it in a movie, but in real life, it's too weird. But then, there's your necessary suspension of disbelief. But Kristin Stewart fell flat as a pancake as the human lead Bella Swan. Boring and at times annoying, Stewart takes awkward to a whole new level in this film. I can't put my finger on it, but she either tried too hard to be an angsty teen, or she just wasn't trying at all. I can't say. Either way, she doesn't work that well.Surprisingly, the secondary characters were generally very well-played. In fact, I'd argue that some of the secondary characters (particularly Carlisle and Esme, Edward's adoptive vampire parents, and his accepting and sweet-hearted adoptive sister Alice) are leaps and bounds beyond Edward or Bella in terms of development. The whole notion of Carlisle and Esme heading a ""vegetarian vampire"" family (they eat animals, not humans) that generally isolates themselves from humans, but respects them as a race and are willing to treat them with kindness and honor¬Ö well, to be honest, it's a lot more compelling than the knock-off Romeo and Juliet tale the film forces down our throats.Although I will say the romance is not without its charm. A few scenes are loosely entertaining (though much more juvenile than any high-school romance I'd ever seen or been in), some of the exchanges are alright, and on the whole, it works on some level. Let me put it this way- I thought I'd hate the romance, but I actually didn't mind it. In fact, if the script and dialog (I'm not gonna lie, it was soap-opera level at best) were better, it could have been great. But as it stands, it was OK.This is where the movie exceeded my expectations.Where it failed my expectations are with two factors- 1) The action, which I thought would be redeeming. The previews lent emphasis to the battles and running and kinetic energy¬Ö but this was just a ploy to lure in boyfriends and husbands¬Ö there is maybe three minutes of action in the whole film. And those three minutes were very sloppily done.And ¬Ö 2) The villain was poorly established (let me rephrase that- NOT established at all) and really didn't lend to the story. He shows up like twice in the whole movie and suddenly just decides to torment our heroes for no reason. It was a glorified sub-plot that should have been cut out during editing for adding nothing to the film.In addition, it felt like a good 15 minutes could have been cut from the film, as there is certainly an abundance of filler material, which bogged and slowed down the movie- at times painfully. Some of Edward and Bella's scenes went on for far too long. The few scenes the villain gets to establish himself really don't work. There are a few subplots, moments and minor characters that just felt unneeded (Somehow, I don't think the Golden Onion award is gonna come back as an important part of the sequels), and there are just shots that feel like they run about 10 seconds too long. Yes, we get it, young lovers like to look into each other's eyes... we don't need to spend a half hour watching the actors do this, though... it gets boring.But like I said, on the whole, it wasn't a bad movie. It was misguided and very juvenile, but I think it works for its target audience, and I'd never take it away from them. For me, as a serious, unbiased movie viewer, it is just decent.

When i watched the movie i could feel the love that Bella and Edward had for each other and how much Edward actually loves Bella more then she knows! It was a sweet movie.

Just no,"My friend told me I should watch this because of ""the great love story and strong female lead"". This is not love but rather borderline stalking. We should not encourage young girls to let their creepy pasty bio partners watch them sleep. Bella is also in no way a strong female lead. She's annoying and her character is pointless. Just because a guy sparkles and likes smelling your hair doesn't mean you should let him stalk you. If this movie was at all realistic(if any vampire movie can be considered that).

"Casting great, too much brooding, ""fast"" special effects --  puh-leeze!","First of all, I enjoyed reading all the books (well, maybe with the exception of the fourth one - ugh), so I really enjoyed seeing the characters come to life on the screen. The casting was really well done; RP is certainly close to what I pictured as Edward -- very believable.Secondly, the scene at the theater made me glad I attended opening night -- total mob scene of teenagers! I'm a 48YO mom, and it was just amusing to be so outnumbered. Wow.I went expecting to be somewhat underwhelmed, but actually the movie was entertaining. A tad too much somber broodiness, which would have been alleviated with perhaps some voice-over POV's from at least Edward in addition to more from Bella. If someone hadn't read the book, they'd be left in the dark on a lot of it. What's going on in the character's heads is extremely important, and explains the why's and how's of the dilemma of this relationship.What I found most disappointing (and yes, I understand that it didn't have a big budget) was the true cheesiness of the special effects. The extremely fast running (in the woods) and climbing around the trees for the most part just looked like they were flying on a wire, or at best, like the movie was fast-forwarding. And that, I felt, was truly distracting and made certain parts feel like a B-movie. I felt bad laughing and rolling my eyes, but really...! But the baseball scene was better than I thought it would be, and the car/rescue scene as well.Anyway, I can see why some love it and some hate it. It could have been way better. But all in all, it was an enjoyable film for those like me who enjoyed seeing Stephanie Meyer's books fleshed out (a little) on the big screen.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Romance is for squares,"These movies are some of the most inane things that anyone has ever made (same thing goes for the books).

A strange experience with this one.....Read on,"After much maligning of ""Twilight"" by everyone I know, I stayed well away from it. It later occurred to me, however, that it is unfair to join in with the slandering, having not actually experienced it myself.Due to so many people's view that the film is utter rubbish, I was nicely built up for a major fall, fully expecting to despise everything about it; when my reaction was rather tepid, it actually felt like a positive! These are things that, to my own surprise, I didn't think were too bad: The idea, on paper, I can see is actually quite a good one. It's an interesting take on the vampire story and though I have not read Meyers' books, I can imagine them to be quite engaging. There is a little allusion to the classic star-crossed lovers, Romeo and Juliet, though if any of the dialogue and character engagements in this film are lifted directly from the book, Meyers is certainly no Shakespeare.The principal cast do the best with what they are given, though I can imagine in many years to come, Robert Pattinson may look back on this Saga in the same way Kevin Bacon famously does on ""Footloose""; whilst being the making of him, he certainly wishes it wasn't. That said, I was pleasantly surprised to find that, unlike Mr Orlando Bloom, who quite frankly cannot act for toffees, Pattinson isn't just a pretty face and at least has some conviction in what he's doing, the occasional bad delivery aside. Given time, I can see him becoming more solid. Kristen Stewart plays Bella and doesn't do too badly; not much else to say on her really. Oddly enough, possibly the best performance in the film is a character I can see getting rather overlooked; Bella's father, Charlie. He is played by Billy Burke, an actor of subtlety and unquestionable command of what is a relatively small role. The rest of the cast are simply fodder, but it is quite a compliment, in what is a very mediocre film, to say that none of the principal actors are weak.The original score stood out for me; I found the main theme to capture the drama nicely, and to be dark, aggressive and yet graceful, which compliments the story being told very nicely. It could be argued, in fact, that this was the element of the film that most caught my attention in a positive way. Conversely, however, there are a couple of moments in the film where I did wonder how Catherine Hardwicke, the director, had decided that the music fit, because it really doesn't! It is in fact directorial decisions that are the true let down for ""Twilight"". The efforts to transfer the story's themes of abstinence to the screen, and to create the metaphor of the decisions a girl must make about what makes a boy the right choice, are fair attempts, but are flawed by a bad screenplay and a director who, to call ham-fisted, would be an understatement! We have lingering shots that aren't necessary in any way other than, it would seem, to glorify somebody's cheekbones; badly judged, long pauses that are supposed to hold tension, both sexual and dramatic, which actually just leave you feeling like you should leave the two lovers alone for a while. We then have drawn out montages, in which we think ""Yes, I get it, they fancy each other, let's move forward now,"" and moments that possibly worked in imagination, but should have been the first thing ditched when making the film, such as glittering vampires (the effect of which was actually quite disappointing; I didn't see much difference). We also have rogue ""bad"" vampires, who appear to carry around their very own fog machine. This last element ruined what was otherwise one of the better, more fun scenes in the film.Another pivotal moment, during which I thought perhaps she had actually managed to shoot something well, is the conversation between Bella and Edward about what he is. It is all going well until we get an out of the blue, unnecessary ""MTV"" moment, with the camera darting all over the place. I assume this is to hold the attention of its audience, but all it does is kill the moment flat. There are many other flaws I could pick out, such as Edward's incessant need to keep returning to Bella every few minutes, only to remind her of why she should stay away from him (I understand it is an attempt to illustrate the idea of not being able to resist someone, but it is pushed too far and looks stupid).""Dawson's Creek with vampires"" nicely sums up how I feel about this film, even in its tone! The character arcs and conversations feel like they're straight from an American High School TV drama (except this is shot worse, at points), but in that context, it does what it sets out to do. Please note that in rating this film, whilst I would personally give it a one-out-of-five, simply for all the previous issues, I am taking into account the target audience it had right from the start, which I assume is the same as that for the book (coming-of-age school or college girls), and not an audience who perhaps appreciate the ""Vampire"" genre outside of this film. If you fit the demographic, ""Twilight"", with all its awful direction, is likely to still hold your attention.",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Twilight -- A Review,"Twilight does not have much of a plot and yet it is a pretty decent film. The main reason why I say this is because the on screen chemistry between Bella Swann (Kristen Stewart) and Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) is positively electric. Kristen Stewart does a great job as Bella Swan who loves the vampire Edward Cullen to the point of obsession. You can see her feelings for Edward beaming from her face. In fact, everyone of her reactions from beginning to end comes across as wholly sincere. Now some have criticized this film for bad acting, but really if you compared Kristen Stewart's performance to that of Drew Barrymore, Kate Hudson, Tatum O'Neal, and Mandy Moore, Stewart puts all those women in chick flicks to shame. As for Robert Pattinson, he too is brilliant as the socially awkward and troubled Edward Cullen who feels he has a terrible secret to hide. Roger Ebert observed in his review that this film is really a metaphor about a teenager who discovers how hard abstinence is. He is right, but Pattinson's character is more complex than that. Edward Cullen is also ashamed of being a vampire, because society sees vampires as monsters, and he tries repeatedly to appear normal in front of Bella Swan only to fail every time. Cullen is a repressed vampire much in the same way as some people are repressed homosexuals, and Pattinson does a really good job in showing that side of Edward.Now the film is not perfect. After Bella discovers who Edward is, the film seems to run out of ideas and has to tack on an unnecessary scene with bad-ass vampires at the end. But in its presentation of a love story, this film is unique. I personally have never seen a love story involving thanatophiles before and presented with such sincerity that you can easily take it for the real thing. I was personally curious at one point about whether there was an off-screen romance between Pattison and Stewart (there wasn't). To say that this film is worth watching would be an understatement. Sadly, if the plot could only have been improved, Twilight would have stood a good chance of becoming a masterpiece in addition to a cult favourite (which undoubtedly it has become).",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Go into this with an empty mind and you will love it beyond belief,"I had read reviews for this prior to viewing and I didn't have my expectations high. I had read three quarters of the book but abandoned it due to being very far behind in a class novel which I had to write an essay about. So a few months later a movie version was released, and I still hadn't finished the book, but I thought I would just see the movie anyway because although I liked the book it wasn't something I was completely gripped into... however things have changed since then.A lot of the criticism for this movie has been about Bella's acting. However I feel the intentions of the people who claim this is actually because while reading the book people have imagined themselves as Bella. Another reason is the actors in this play the characters very very very real, while the situation they are in is very fantastical and requires some suspension of disbelief. However, the story wraps itself around your imagination and becomes a film that you cant help but enjoy. Die hard fans of the book claim that the movie 'sucks compared to the book' but true fans will appreciate the movie because it wasn't until the movie that I went back and read the book from start to finish again. Robert Pattison is cast very well as Edward Cullen capturing the role very well, not quite as frightening as the book but still very very good job and it would be hard to imagine anyone else in the role.The only parts of the movie I didn't enjoy is when the word 'chillax' was used. And the very UN-subtle and obvious cameo where Stephenie Meyer is handed a coffee with the waitress basically screaming into the camera 'THERE YOU GO STEPH' other than that... rather brilliant :) Oh yeah, Im seventeen, male, straight and still loved it. You can love this movie without being in love with Edward Cullen ;)",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Average movie with a dark shade,"Well guys, this is going to be my first movie review so it will be a bit rusty, bear with me. Just now I came home after watching ""Twilight"", supposedly a 'vampire' love story. Well I can't see I am very much impressed, I have seen much better vampire movies (did I tell you that I am a fan of ""good"" vampire movies?). But this one was not total disaster as well, the director was in fact creative at times. Frankly speaking I didn't expect it to be that much 'dark'. And its the dark shade in it that impressed me. The location, the acting, the silence, the weather, almost everything; the director surely wanted to throw some gloomy stuff and let me tell ya, she (I guess I am right) is successful in that. But the storyline and script, sorry to say, wish were as impressive. Kristen as Bella Swan acted as the perfect and helpless damsel-in-distress, but at times she acted too much 'helpless', as if she didn't have a clue what's happening. The others were so-so. I didn't understand the reason behind bringing the character played by Cam Gigandet (that guy played a powerful character as Kevin Volchok in the ever popular show ""O.C""). I mean why suddenly he will be after Isabella's life like crazy is still unclear to me (I mean there are so many more ""bella's"" around to feast upon, right?)!! Anyways overall its an average movie but a couple of points for the dark shade, I really enjoyed that part.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
A perfect romance movie!,"What can i say? I loved this movie! I've noticed that so many people find it bad, awful or whatever.. But if you go to a movie to watch vampires killing and blood everywhere, it's just not that movie. For a romance lovers, it's a perfect movie. And actors did a great job. They're young and talented and, in my opinion, they were simply perfect for their characters. As one could say, it is a vampire Romeo and Juliet story for the feelings it brings up in the viewer. It's not a horror movie you would scream, it's a lover's movie which is perfect for taking your date on. My heart was full of butterflies watching this movie.. More movies like this, i'd say..",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
""" Dying  is  part  of  nature, but  then  I'm  a  freak  of  nature ""","Throughout film history, the story of the Vampire has established a number of historical origins, film adaptations and colorful characters. From the earliest silent Nosferatu in 1922 to this newest addition called "" Twilight "" the Vampire story continues. Here several adaptations are noted to previous blood sucking, night crawling creatures. For instance, they no longer keep to the night, but can walk about during the day. They are no longer flesh tearing, ghouls who patiently wait for a ripe throat to rip open. Indeed, these new young Vampires are interestingly more patient than their predecessors as they now can 'choose' to become vegetarian and stoically drink only animal blood. Furthermore, unlike previous film victims our movie heroine Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) is a pro-modern girl, childishly independent, annoyingly self-confident and stubbornly assured. The drawn, pale and undernourished Hero on the other hand, is Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) a physically powerful but emotionally disturbed, family troubled hybrid. Unloved, uncertain yet seeking a lifetime companion, he explains to Bella of his origin from the fangs of Dr. Carlisle Cullen, (Peter Facinelli) the 'family' patriarch and his need for her. This first of the three part story of Twlight as adapted to the silver screen is confusing, hap-hazard, poorly directed and juvenile with an overdose of anemic romance. The acting is pedestrian with child-like cut-outs characters and it's difficult to understand why the settings are so confined. Still, there is some quality to the story, if one believes in compassionate Vampires. Otherwise, we'll have to wait for part two. ***",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
To slow to be fun to watch,"I haven't read the books, I don't have a love affair with the actors like some reviewers seem to, which makes their reviews quite bias, I didn't even know it was popular until months after seeing the movie. I didn't find the acting to be bad but I think some of the parts could have gone to better fitted people. The location seemed fitting for vampires and having them be teens was a neat twist.The problem I had is it was like the movie never got started. There was this very minimal love story going on and tacky action scenes that was just enough to bring you out of the coma the rest of the film put you in. I just sat that after an hour plus waiting for the movie to become something: a drama, action, romance, suspense, anything. It only began to become interesting a little before it was over.

Hollywood should REALLY rise their standards,"And I don't mean this film should have been sullied with gore, language, excretions etc, missed by some who hated the film. I also happen to know that vampires-burning-in-the-sun part of lore was added in 1922 by movie Nosferatu. My problem is that this film had bad script and terrible, ugly photography. Characters were tedious, only colours were ugly grey and sickly blue, and there's basically no plot. Where was richly romantic, elegant imagery? Where was... well, anything? Even hero's ""diamond-like"" sparkling didn't look especially diamond-like. Story is supposedly set in real place called Forks, but this high-school is unrealistically clean place with friendly kids only and not any bullying or nastiness. Why use name of real place? I suppose this is from alternative universe Forks or Stephenie Meyer is home-schooled. If you want movie about vampire romance, look Bram Stoker's Dracula. Imagery is fabulous and cast is perfect.",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Loved it.,"I've read the books, seen the film. I loved it. However, it doesn't stick to the books as much as they like, but I think they got the actors right. It's good, I really enjoyed it, me and my friend went to see it, we're die hard fans of the twilight series, we had our disappointments but really, most films that come out of a novel are altered to make sense for the non-readers, but we enjoyed it immensely all the same. Don't read an over all synopsis and think, vamp film, equals horror. cause it's just not how it goes, its fantasy. And its aimed at teenagers, so there will be cheesy romance, sexual tension, and a few touching moments. If you go in with preconceptions, you're bound to be disappointed. that's how it goes. I went in with an open mind and enjoyed myself immensely, I'd go again, and I'm dying for it to come out on DVD.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
i've never read the books and after seeing this i'm never going to either!!,what a lame movie for many reasons.firstly- Kristen Stewarts character of Bella is not even essential to the little plot in this movie because the whole way through i kept thinking that this movie could be done in so many ways without her. its not a movie where one would find it hard to imagine without certain characters because the movie and even the book i dare say could have went in a better direction without the inclusion of her character. for example i would have preferred if the love story was eliminated and they focused on the the rivalry between the Cullens and the werewolves or the vampire villains and given them a chance to be a more intricate part of the movie.i have to go back to a previous point because i can gather that the whole point of this series is the romance between Bella and Edward but it just didn't work for me which is why i think a different direction would have been better.secondly- this movie focuses way to much on belle and Edward which annoyed me because the other characters were given very little screen time. it was more annoying because as i said before Bella is not essential and yet she's eating up 80 per cent of the screen time. there are plenty of characters in the Cullen family but we're not given enough time to get to know any of them and they probably could have been more interesting than the lead roles. the villains suffer from this as well because they're only two scenes before the lame baseball game scene and we don't know them. we just see them randomly attack people and we don't even get to see the attack. a film needs decent antagonists but this misses the mark totally a they have no point or motive other than to create a bit of action at the end. for me a movie is all about the development of good guys and bad guys but this has only good guy development on an uninteresting level and no bad guy element whatsoever.thirdly- there is nothing interesting in this movie.towards the end i was begging for something interesting to happen and when something finally did ( Bella becoming a vampire) it went back to square one as she is saved by Edward. this was a total waste because at least if she was bitten it would have justified her characters purpose to be in this movie and the lined up sequels.fourthly- it's too long and seems never ending- major cuts could have been made SKIP THIS PIECE OF CRAP!!!! just when you think its over.............It continues!!fifthly- the special effects in some scenes are awful and since when can vampires run up trees? also its not even true to vampires at all because sunlight doesn't burn them or anything they just glow ( LAME)SIXTHLY- The performances are nothing special and are laughable in places. Kristen Stewart is lack-lustre but is the best part of this train wreck because she's cute to look at. Robert pattison is just creepy and boring in his role. he has nothing interesting to say except 'i can read everyone's mind here except yours' oh and he reveals that he is the bad guy of the film wtf!!!! sad to say that the sequels are lined up!,3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
A great story for teenage girls,"The movie was directed by Catherine Hardwicke, the story was written by Stephanie Meyer and rewritten by Melissa Rosenberg. The age rating is 12.The film is about a 17-year-old girl (Bella Swan), who is moving from Phoenix to Forks to live with her father. In school she makes friends easily. Finally she meets Edward Cullen in the biology lesson. The first meeting is a bit scary but after he saves her life, they become a couple. She thinks his behaviour is strange and mysterious and adds the pieces together: She finds out that Edward is a vampire. When a group of other vampires terrifies the town, Bella gets in danger. Will Edward save her again? We think that the movie is well made. It's a great story for teenage girls, who love mysterious boys and a bit of fantasy action. The characters are strong personalities and fit together well. The music makes every situation more intense, which is good because the actors cannot show their feelings really well. The special effects underline the actions of the vampires. They also help the audience to understand how vampires move and their way to be.By Sophia W. and Oliwia K.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Interesting,"My fianc√©' had wanted to see this movie and I had been putting it off for weeks. I consider myself a serious film goer, and had no interest in seeing a tween targeted movie. I do not know if it was because I expected to hate it, but going in with very little knowledge and low expectations I found Twilight quite enjoyable. The acting was surprisingly good, the setting was beautiful and the story kept me going. I would give it a solid B. If I had to give the film any criticism at all, it would have to bee that the Cullen family all looked too good. It was like a vampire supermodel convention. I was pleasantly surprised to see Peter Facinelli in this film, he has always been one of my favorite ""under the radar"" actors. All in all I would recommend this film as a great popcorn movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"It was OK once, but i'll never watch it again.","This movie was actually a little harder to review than I thought it'd be. I didn't rush out to see twilight, but I had a free movie pass and it seemed like the most interesting candidate.The story, though not entirely original, wasn't entirely all that bad either. It was obviously geared at a demographic for around an 8th grade level. The characters were established, but not really developed much. Visually, I was disappointed with a lot of the same old special effects. I laughed at how silly and obvious all the vampires were. Climbing up walls or trees really fast was done with a kind of Jacky Chan harness and cable method. Vampires moving really fast was just sped up and blurred footage of the actors. So unfortunately it felt a lot like I was watching a Disney channel original movie. There were a few interesting dream like sequences, but not nearly enough to save the whole movie. There were also a few nice camera shots, but even those were kinda ruined by bad lighting or a shaky cameras.In order to appeal to the younger demographic, they intentionally made the adult characters look silly and ""out of the loop"" by having them use teenage slang. It worked basically, but to me it seemed just as forced and ridiculous when the younger characters did it too.So heres where it became debatable for me. The story was actually kinda interesting. Not really intricate or clever or in depth, but I was interested to see what was going to happen next. So while at some points the scenes dragged more than I liked, and I wont ever say ""I could really go for some Twilight this evening,"" I can say that for a free movie pass, my attention was kept for 2 hours.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

"A bad script to a clich√©' story with very mediocre actors (especially Stewart) and filled with unmotivated camera angles, dreary dialogue  and lame villains.","I have to say I went on to view this film with very little expectations of actually thinking it was going to be good, based on all the ridiculous hype it was receiving mostly from young teenage girls and the fact that the plot and theme looked all around uninteresting to me.The first 20 minutes play out in a general new girl in town, getting used to everything conventional way.. she meets some friends who know some information on the school and therefore point her in the right direction to pursue a character (male) who will go onto become the trail for the plot... yeah it's generic but the setup was at least enough to keep me still interested....We paddle around for another 20 minutes to inevitably get to a scene where Edward the guy reveals he's a vampire to the girl and at this point the script goes into complete preposterous avenues.... dialogue so ridiculous I was going on to have spasms and cringe from the words being said... Things seem very unnatural and merely written just to move the story along.At this point I basically lost all faith in the film and I got to say it goes downhill from there. The plot sets up some very uninteresting villains and leads up to a very mediocre climax. Now I know this is an adaptation for a book and maybe it was all a lot more interesting to read rather than watch because I was bored in some spots and still choking down the awful script.It's a bad sign when I have to look down at the DVD player and see how far in the picture is.. and chanting in my mind ""when is this going to end""... The movie also seems to drag on for a numbing extra unneeded 10 or 15 minutes..Overall: A bad script to a clich√©' story with very mediocre actors (especially Stewart) and filled with unmotivated camera angles, dreary dialogue and lame villains.",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
*sob*,"I am a huge fan of the Twilight series and couldn't wait to see this movie.

I wasn't looking for ""Best Movie of the Year"" but at least a enjoyable film. I nearly cried my eyes out when I realized how bad Twilight really was! I had to look away from the horrible effects and try not to listen to the cheesy dialogue scenes. The movie also had tons of plot holes for people who didn't read the book. It just seemed to me like they only had to film the thing and throw it in theaters. They just didn't plan the scenes out very well and although it was a big box office hit, it was still a failure.

"Sweet, silly and schmaltzy, but enjoyable","There has been so much brouhaha about this film that it seems like people fall into two camps - hate it or love it. I liked it. I thought it was a sweet and innocent take on the forbidden love theme. Buffy did a whole lot better, in terms of acting, script, wit and the smoldering sensuality, but I just kept reminding myself this was NOT Buffy, the Vampire Slayer (though many of the scenes and much of the dialog were direct ripoffs), but something else.Kristen Stewart was credible as the self-contained Bella and Robert Pattinson was very good as the devoted Edward. Both were touchingly innocent and awkward with each other, making their romance seem more human (and therefore flawed), than it might have been had the director gone for a more torrid and adult love.My vote - go see it, if no other reason than to know what all the unnecessary hoopla was about. Just keep in mind it isn't Buffy, the Vampire Slayer, but more of a coming of age OMG I'm in love with a vampire film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

I was just like get on with it, get to the important stuff!!! The reason I gave this a 3 and not a 1 is because there were a few funny moments.

"Of Course It Had Flaws, But I Still Loved It!","So, Twilight. What to say about Twilight?Cast: The casting director clearly did their job extremely well because everyone did amazing. Robert Pattinson as Edward was maybe the best decision about this movie. While watching the movie, I actually forgot he was British. Though his accent may have faltered some times, he seemed to do just fine. The supporting cast pulled off their characters pretty well. Especially Nikki Reed. I do however, wish I could say the same with Kristen Stewart. Several times during the movie, it seemed like she didn't put much effort into it, or she overacted way too much. But for most of the movie, she was tolerable.The Script: Melissa Rosenberg did fine for the most part. She kept some of the main lines in there like the ""heroin"" one and the ""lion&lamb"". But she did feel it was necessary to add her own cheesiness in there. There were some lines that left me thinking, ""What the hell does that mean?"" On a lighter note, it was unexpectedly funny. I didn't expect to laugh that much. A lot of it came from the human friends of Bella. It was a nice surprise to laugh.The Setting: Breathtaking. It was just so, green. And remarkable. Oregon was a well chosen place to film.The Make-Up: Noticeable. You could see Edward's contacts and eyeliner in the film. I liked it how Kristen Stewart said ""...you're pale white..."", but yet, she is exactly the same color.The Special Effects: Probably the worst part of the movie. I knew the budget wasn't high, so I didn't expect anything great from it. The ""speed"" effect kind of reminded me of Benny Hill. The ""sparkle"" effect however, I did not have a problem with. I was very pleased with it. And the baseball scene? Brilliant. The jumping from tree-to-tree wasn't that great. You could tell they used wires. It just seemed a bit, off.The Music: I loved the music very much. The songs seemed to match the scene just fine. Like Supermassive Black Hole with the baseball scene was great. As well as Let Me Sign towards the end of the movie. And Spotlight when Edward was telling the back story of the Cullen family was another favorite of mine. The score was alright though. I loved the lullaby, but the rest of the music with the electric guitar reminded me of a 90's porno.Goofs: Of course there were some, this IS a low budget movie. But I'll let you spot them out. :) But best scene out of entire movie? Baseball scene. Everything about that was amazing.Overall, I thought it was very good and I didn't think it would be that good. It was a fun movie, and I plan on seeing it more than once in the theater. And I can't wait for New Moon.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Somehow Worse Than I Expected it to be,"Twilight follows Bella, a high schooler who, upon moving to a new town, falls in love with a boy at her school. However, as they grow closer she begins to realize that there's more to him than she initially thought.Towards the end of the movie there's a part of the climax that, although I knew exactly how it would end, put me slightly on edge. I felt a little tense and worried for the characters.Other then that, this movie is a steaming pile of poop.Where to start, the writing, how about there. Holy cow, it's awful. From start to finish every line of dialogue is absolutely awful. Everything sounds extremely scripted and unnatural. You could argue that its the actors, but trust me, I'll get to that. Most of the lines are far to elaborate and poetic to sound like a real conversation.Now the characters. Flat. That's all I can think of. There's no character development, everything the characters say is important to the story. No one has any real conversations about stuff that isn't really important. While it is possible to develop a character while they explain things, this movie is incapable of understanding that fact. The characters present every line of information with little to no emotion, and it sheds little on who that person actually is. Furthermore, the characters act like they have fallen in love, and the movie acts like that's true, and yet the main characters have zero chemistry and no development of their relationship. Whenever the movie has the opportunity to develop them it just skips past it, or shows montages of them talking with music over it, so they aren't actually saying anything that we as an audience can hear. And yet I'm supposed to believe that these people are in love? That's unlikely. By the end I felt absolutely nothing for these characters. Even as I write this I feel nothing.Now on to the acting. To start, I like Kristen Stewart. I've seen some of her newer movies and I've liked her. But she's embarrassingly bad in this movie. She makes these weird moans/snickers/groans or something before and/or after every single line of dialogue, and whenever she talks she shakes and moves her head awkwardly. Its super distracting and awkward, and if she's trying to play a socially inept character then she's doing a horrible job of it. Besides, its clear that she isn't socially inept. She's able to talk to people right off the bat of meeting them pretty easily, and somehow manages to fall for a boy in half a school semester. Not that that means a whole lot, though. There were even a handful of scenes where I started laughing at how bad her delivery was. Every other actor is, while not as bad as Stewart, pretty mediocre. Anna Kendrick in particular doesn't suit her role.Whenever the vampires fight or move the movie uses special effects to make it look like they're moving faster, but it just looks cheap and dumb, and really doesn't add a whole lot to the movie. If anything, it makes it feel more like an anime, only it's live action. Yeah, those always turn out good.When the climax finally rolls around it's stupid. It's so incredibly rushed, forced, and unexplained that it just doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Like the movie suddenly realized: ""Oh shoot, we need an action-packed climax for this vampire movie. Let's just throw some more vampires in and make them fight for some unexplainable and stupid reason."" It's just so out of nowhere. Now I don't usually have a problem with climaxes that just kind of come out of nowhere, but this movie rushed into it so fast and treated it like it was a developed conflict that had been building up for this entire 2 hour movie.Yes, this movie is 2 hours. How it pulls that off, I haven't the slightest clue. The worst thing is, it only gets worse. While its not exactly boring, it does start down that path towards the end.Overall Twilight is one of the most unpleasant movies I've ever seen. The acting is wooden, the writing is awful, the characters are flat, the climax is awful, and so is basically everything else. The only reason this review isn't longer or more elaborate is because I simply can't remember everything and I'm not really in the mood to write a long review right now. Plus I feel like I'm just rewriting what so many others already have said. In the end, this movie is awful. Don't watch it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Fantastic!,"To sum it up: AMAZING The plot seems really silly at first - I know - but this movie is awesome! Brilliant directing, producing, acting, etc. It's dramatic and romantic, but funny at the same time (a true dramedy!). I enjoyed every minute of it. I'm DEFINITELY gonna read the books! You can so tell that Stephenie Meyers is an excellent author, I'm really looking forward to reading her books, they're gonna be excellent! Like I said, fantastic acting! Some really promising talent. The performances were emotional, funny... take your pick!I would recommend this movie to anyone with two ears, two eyes and a heart.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
ugh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Let me preface by saying that I have never written a comment about a film on the internet before; however, I feel so passionately about how bad this film was, that I felt, as a person that paid to see the film, entitled to comment.Yes, I read the book and am currently on the third book. The books are incredible! Stephanie, the author, made me giggle, cry, and swoon on every page from the sensual chemistry and love between Edward and Bella.The film was terrible! I have a degree in film-making and I could have done a better job! The script and the cinematographer was awful! The actress that played Bella was horrible! She seemed to be having an epileptic seizure the entire film, ""i...u u u uh...um...i i i...what's wrong?"" Her performance was so distracting it took away from each scene. The film also played that way. The director tried to cram some of the important parts from the book into the movie, but not successfully. This film played like some staccato jumble. In fact, she (the director) negated some key points if ever there is to be a sequel.Even if the director wasn't trying to follow the book, the film was a disgrace. There were also key elements not translated from the book about the relationship between Edward and Bella. This made the development seem unnatural and forced. I can't even comment on the scene in the secret meadow, where the director decided that Edward jumping around trying to reveal some plot line would be a good idea.The one aspect that did save the film was Edward, he was magnificent. If only he had had a better co-star, they could have had significantly better on screen chemistry. Even my husband, in which I felt terrible in the end for having him take me to the film and having him sit for 120 minutes, thought that there were a lot of holes in the film and he didn't read the book.The other redeeming thing about the film is ended with a Radiohead song.Overall, terrible movie. It is possible to express emotion on film without over doing it, and this was too much. I think it should be redone with a better screen play, director, and lead actress.",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Bella and Edward,"As a reader of books you can say that when a movie is written about them you say, what? In this newly adapted page to screen book it is fairly decent. This is not like anything you can say the negative talk about. Sure you say that the book has more detail but when you read, the author writes out the detail and on screen the detail is already there. So go see this movie after reading the book and just enjoy it for what it is and don't listen to critics. It just makes you hate movies that you may like. Also as an added bonus to this movie you have very good looking' actors to watch.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Screen Adaptation of the Twilight Novel (Novel written by Stephenie Meyer),"For all of those who feel the Twilight movie is not good, you're wrong and I'm not sorry for stating it.The Twilight Saga books are excellent. You ask: ""How can that be?"" Well, books that are not good do not make the country's best seller list. Also, the authors that write bad books are not nominated for writing awards. It's sort of like 2 + 2 = 4. Stephenie Meyer wrote the Twilight Saga books. These books have been on the best seller list since they came out, the books have sold millions of copies worldwide, and Ms. Meyer has been named and nominated for various awards. Additionally, Stephenie Meyer's first book, Twilight, was made into a movie. Guess you didn't see that one coming, did you? Another question: How can a bad movie be number two (2) in the United States and world? Financially speaking, Twilight has broken a lot of box office records.You have to love books in the first place. You have to know that Stephenie Meyer wrote Twilight because she had a dream about a couple in a beautiful ""meadow."" The young man in the meadow was a vampire, but, the young woman was an average-ordinary girl.Also, you have to believe in true love. A young couple cross each other's paths. By common standards, their love is doomed, but true love conquers all. This may all sound like sugar-sweet, candy-coated garbage to some, but, what about a man or woman who returns from war and is severely physically damaged. By common standards, love for this person is not conceivable. But, then, his/her path crosses with someone who sees the real person - not the physical limitation. It's the same for Bella and Edward in Twilight. The circumstances may be different - but it's the same story. Love conquers all.For anyone who wishes to ""trash"" the Twilight Saga - okay. That's your opinion. I choose to thank Stephenie Meyer for sharing her dream with the world. Anything good does not hurt. Good always makes life better.If you haven't read the Twilight Saga, read it. You will be surprised when you can't put these books down. They're wonderfully addictive. And, if you're gonna have an addiction, Twilight should be your ""heroin"" of choice.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Immortality doesn't seem so bad..,"Well, I was hearing all this fuss about Twilight so I rented the DVD and watched it with my girlfriend. At first, I wasn't impressed, just another love story with supernatural beings involved. OK.So I was told it was based on a novel series written by Stephenie Meyer. I decided to read them all before I could compare the movie and book.I have to tell you guys. The story is intriguing. I won't say it is a masterpiece of writing like usually delivered by the likes of JK Rowling and Stephen King. It's just that everyone (especially teen girls) start dreaming about it and suddenly are drawn to this fantastic universe.I do have a few cons on my mind. The Bella character was not at all well developed. She just moved to her dad's home because her mother in on the road with her new husband. She meets the Cullens and becomes fascinated with the youngest and everything is history. We never really see her dreams, her goals. Basically only ""Wow, he's so handsome. What? You're a vampire? I don't care.. in fact, I wanna become one as well!!"". That pretty much summarizes the basic plot.Not to mention Stewart's performance. I had never seen any of her movies before so when I watched Twilight I thought she was pretty good. Her nervous behavior, frowning.. then I read the book and thought ""Wow, she nailed the character!"". Then I watched a few solo interviews of hers and I was amazed that she played the Bella character in real life as well.. basically her mannerisms in the movie are just the same in real life. But it did suit the movie though.I read they had a tight budget to work on so that explains the unrealistic special effects.Also, the Edward & Bella thing was a bit rushed to me. There should've been a few more scenes before the sudden confession in the restaurant. It seemed like in one scene they were getting to know each other. Edward desperately trying to stay away from Bella and the human curious about her savior. And then next scene, they decided they were in love.Anyways, it's the beginning of an epic love story. The next movies will be even better, so don't miss this one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"Entertaining, albeit completely unintentionally.","Twilight - Based on the popular children's novels, Twilight is about high schooler Bella (Kristen Stewart), the palest resident of Arizona ever, as she moves to be the palest non-vampire in Washington. She meets smoldering young-looking vampire Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) and the two have the most awkward courtship in the history of film. Then he fights some of the most ridiculous and un-scary looking vampires ever to grace the silver screen with their presence.That's really all there is to the plot, and man is it stretched over two hours. Luckily, the film is hilarious, albeit entirely unintentionally. All intentional attempts at humor fall flat. Basically Twilight seizes you with it's big awkward fist immediately, and rarely lets go. The best example (and there are many) is Bella's relationship with her dad, the always uncomfortable looking Billy Burke. There are spaces between their lines that you could drive a truck through. It's all just painfully awkward.Some things kept running through my mind. Edward is supposed to have spent 108 years on this planet. In those 108 years, couldn't he have picked up some basic social skills? Pattinson seems to have watched Charlie Sheen's performance in ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" for research on the undead, because he spends most of the film staring bug-eyed like he's strung out on meth. He gets the American accent all right, and that's the best I can give him. He's supposed to be cool. He's often just antisocial and creepy, especially with lines like ""I enjoy watching you sleep."" This line was hilarious by the way, and there are many that are almost as good. He has absolutely nothing interesting to say, and the makeup people have covered him in glitter for his sunlight scenes, presumably as the final rite of emasculation.I expect so much more from Melissa Rosenberg, a writer on my favorite show Dexter. Stick with TV honey! Teen fantasy does your creepy off-beat writing no favors. I think the script was about 70 pages long, so they filled the rest with awkward silence, during which everyone seems to be struggling for their next line. Sweet jeepers, half the responses the actors give each other aren't even human sounding. What I said for Rosenberg goes for amateurish director Catherine Hardwicke, who should stick with her day job of production designer. She cannot film action or direct actors to save her soul. She has tried to give this the feel of teen angst but has instead come up with an awkward monstrosity that could put the combined talents of Michael Cera and Larry David to shame.Bella is boring and, as mentioned, criminally pale. She's pretty, but I hate her, and her voice is bothersome. It's annoying to have followed a character that does not seem to give a crap about anything, and spends the entire film frowning. She also has the keen observational abilities of a squirrel for not guessing Ed was a vampire, or at least some sort of freakish being, two seconds after he stops a car with his hand. Neither does this freak out or intrigue anyone else in the vicinity, strangely. It's not Ed's weird behavior, aversion to sunlight or mind reading skills but his cold skin that tells Bella he's a vampire, thanks to the magic of Google. Thanks Google! It's so campy, silly and shoddily made that I should hate this film by all standards, but I had a great time. Ironically the less attached to the books the more fun you'll have. I'd give it a D for all fans but the youngest and most devoted. I haven't read the books but I'm sure it has been ripped to shreds on the journey to the film. But I had an wonderful time laughing at the film, minus puncturing points of boredom and a few times where I looked at my watch. One positive note: the soundtrack isn't half bad.Awkward to the end and funny all the way through, Twilight gets a C",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Good book and a good film.,"""but dying in a place of someone I loved, seems like a good way to go¬Ö.""It can happen. Even words like courageous, passionate, inquisitive and daring can describe a girl. If he was a teenager, Count Dracula would be proud. Bella, a young, deeply passionate, teen aged human girl and a not so young, if not even more passionate, (am) seventeen year old vampire boy, Edward meet, greet and fall in love. They fight the odds to stay together. There are both good and bad vampires in the mix, all gorgeous (because ugly vamps don't sell movie tickets :) and there's a number of decent human souls as well. To my surprise, young or old, they all delivered fine performances. Then, again, I am just a cat. I give mucho kudos to what I liked best about Twilight - direction. The setting, the blocking, the lighting, the film in general - Catherine Hardwicke rules! The books are great and Melissa Rosenberg wrote a nice script, but Hardwicke made the film for me. The action is great, the inaction if even greater and combined with a fabulous soundtrack, Twilight is absolutely kickerz! Some say Twilight is the poster child film for teen abstinence. Others go as far as labeling the genre abstinence porn. I say: get a dark side, folks! This is a vampire. He doesn't want to get into her pants, he wants to get into her veins! The picture is great.

I wanted so much more...,"We all know the deal here quiet, retiring Bella Swan moves in with her father Charlie to dreary, old, boring Forks. There she meets the adorable, sexy and mysterious Edwards Cullen problem is he's a vampire...bad times... and so a great Romeo and Juliet style love struggle comes into play.Now to the important stuff :) I adore Stephanie Meyer's books and the thing I loved about this movie is that it really stayed ridiculously true to the book. All the characters looked exactly how I imagined them, the locations were perfect, even the cars! Everything was done down to a T and that's a credit to Catherine Hardwicke.Robert Pattinson is perfect as the sullen, lonely vampire although I had to try a few times not to laugh at his ""crazy eyes"", Nikki Reed will definitely come in to her own in the later movies as the stuck up pretentious Rosalie, Peter Facinelli was a pleasant surprise as Carlisle and Billy Burke brought something refreshing and different to Charlie. Even Taylor Launter, who I was extremely worried about, pulled it out of the bag...unfortunately it was all really let down by Kirsten Stewart. I'd high hopes, I'd seen her before in other things but she just didn't seem to get Bella, she looked like her, talked as I imagined but there was something missing...she did have chemistry with Pattinson but not enough to make me truly believe in her character...that was a major disappointment for me. Bella is the everyday girl, the one that anyone reading the books wants to relate to....and it was just a really wooden and boring performance from her.I sincerely hope that Stewart gets some acting lessons for New Moon and then maybe the avid readers can get the full movie experience they'd been hoping for as well as people who haven't read the books because as it stands this movie will only appeal to fans and that's all.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Embarrassing to Watch,"Thankfully I didn't bring my husband with me when I saw this movie. I went by myself and I was STILL embarrassed by its sappy/corny screen writing. The movie doesn't catch the essence of the books at all. The effects were horrible. The ""blurs"" when the vampires were moving uber-fast looked like a sad mistake from a bad 1970s film, and the wire-work when Edward and Bella are leaping from Edward's room to a tree looks like NOTHING like a leap; they clumsily swing back and forth. yuck. Rob's American accent is generally pretty unbelievable--unless Edward is supposed to have a speech impediment. Some of the acting in the movie was pretty good--Charlie, Rosalie, and a few others, for instance. Most of the acting was Horrible--and here I'm mainly talking about the two MAIN characters. Not believable at ALL. Kristen Stewart is WAY too serious, and she doesn't let you into her head at all----which is a huge part of the books, I might add. It's like she's just looking for good camera angles the whole movie through. Rob Pattinson makes vampirism seem really boring. He doesn't do well playing a perfect character. In interviews he even says that Kristen Stewart is intimidating in real life and probably looks like the real vampire in the movie, because she made him nervous and clumsy....THAT's vampire-like! Bad directing. Does Catherine Hardwicke hate the light side of human nature, or what? It seems like most of the actors in all the movies she's ever directed hardly smile at all. nice going. i won't be seeing this movie again.

Very romantic,"I never read the books before watching this film. I thought I would probably like it because I'm a bit of sucker for corny romance and a good-looking lead male, but seriously I loved it. The chemistry between Rob and Kristen is so captivating, the director was so passionate, the cinematography is gorgeous and the soundtrack and the way it accompanies the film and adds tension, especially to the romantic scenes, is beyond awesome. The baseball scene has to be one of the best scenes I have ever watched. It is just ridiculously romantic and artistic and I was totally and utterly sucked in. Unfortunately, I loved it so much I decided to read the books which were ridiculously bad and ridiculously addictive in equal measure. So, I read the whole saga as if it were some kind of drug and now the beautifully romantic picture created in the film has been slightly spoiled.... I would say, if you like this film, please use restraint (just like Edward :-)) and do not read the books (except the first one which I admit is pretty good if you are a corny romantic soul like me). Catherine Hardwicke is a brilliant and dedicated director and the casting was fantastic. This is an absolutely brilliant film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Don't waste your time.,"So I watched this horrible movie and regret it. I don't even know where to start, the acting was poor, the plot was stupid there were dumb vampire fights and it keeps going! Kristen Stewart isn't a bad actress, (Just watch her in Speak) but she did not shine in this, unlike her vampire sparkly boyfriend. I know girls who love this movie and the books, but both were terrible in my opinion. Kristen Stewart flinches and twitches this whole film and I have no idea why. Also the s-s-stuttering. And Edward always looks like he has an awful stomach ache. But they did stay true to the book, Edward is just as controlling and creepy as he was in the books and Bella is just as annoying and whiny even though everything goes her way mostly.

Twilight,"I really have to disagree with the film not missing anything. There was a lot of information from the book not shown in the film. It is absolutely reasonable because the book is over 500 pages long.I did like the film, but it just wasn't as great as the book. There were things in the film that we absolutely in correct. For example, the dance that Mike and everyone was talking about first was not Prom. First, Mike asked Bella to go to the spring dance and that's when Bella used the excuse of going away for the weekend. Also, I really didn't like how the scene of the meadow was rushed. That is an extremely important part in the book when Bella confronts Edward about what he truly is. I think that the film could have elaborated a little more on these important parts. The book is about their unconditional love and how are people supposed to see that when everything is being rushed just to get into the James scene.I hope that the next film will be a little bit better after they have seen the great outcome of Twilight on opening weekend.

OK. Just OK.,"My Take: Not as great as the hype made it look, but still the movie fans would be delighted with.After a few popularity rates later, the hype got to me. Okay, not really. But while I didn't get the chance to read the immensely popular and addictive bestseller by Stephanie Meyer, I did get the chance to see the long-awaited adaptation. Advance news announced that the movie would have a limited budget since it isn't produced by a big, major studio, but the fans don't seem to take a hint. Besides, how much can a vampire movie cost? Well indeed, the low-budget quality of this TWILIGHT adaptation is obvious, the film still came out fine. As a breezy, cozy chick flick, TWILIGHT delivers. It'll make several teenage girls say ""aww.."" every time while giving their dates a chance to make their move. I should have seen this with a date (of which I planned to)! I guess that pretty much what the movie was meant to be. It's sweet, cozy date movie (where the 'date' part is the guaranteed success).Kristen Stewart is a finely credible Bella, an attractive teenage girl who moves to the gloomy town of Forks with her father (Billy Burke) while her a mother remarries. Warmly accepted by her new classmates at at her new school, she is also fascinated by the mysteriously attractive Edawrd Cullen (Robert Pattinson), who, with no surprise to any fan or reader, is actually a vampire. Against all odds, the two unlikely couple fall in love and all the mellow moments flow. Also at hand are the consequences of their unlikely affair as a blood-hungry vampires pursue Bella, seeing her a nothing but a snack.TWILIGHT loses its inspiration in a few scenes, namely the ""effects-laden"" moments as in the baseball scenes and scenes where the vampires jump on top of each other, but it doesn't so in its endearing old-fashioned romance. As an intimate love story, TWILIGHT does just about it. Try not to hug your date even when the movies over!Rating: *** out of 5.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Meh,"Typically when a movie gets a low rating or bad reviews, people will assume it's bad and hop on the bandwagon to hate it. I decided that I'll go ahead and watch it, perhaps it'll have a redeeming factor or two. Man, was I so wrong. It had cardboard cutouts for characters and a boring story to boot. I wasn't entertained the whole way through.On to the main couple. Bella's acting's not the worst like people claim but her dialogue was just plain horrible. Edward is pretty much a pale stoned ""vampire"" that has close to 0 personality nor likability. The way he shows his affection is too creepy when he was ""stalking"" her. Their scenes together are kinda meh, completely devoid of chemistry.The baseball scene made was quite baffling to me, I understand it's for family bonding but it did nothing but to fill the time.The final scene could not get anymore anti-climatic either, the fight was choreographed poorly and badly executed.But all in all, I wasn't the main demographic for this movie that's aimed to make teenage girls riled up with the good looking men, which I have nothing against.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

not more romantic than a love story between a cat and a mouse,"Let me start by saying I like vampire movies and I don't have any prejudice for a human falling into love with any creature. The movie is about the love between a vampire which is quite different than all the vampires I have seen so far and a human girl. The first problem with this setting is the abilities the vampires have. They can walk in the sun light, they don't die by silver, they are fast, they are ultra strong, they are unbeatable. I think they confused the vampires with super heroes. The problem is, all these upgrades they made to usual vampire kind make them a strong predator and a love story between such a predator and a human is certainly not more romantic than a love story between a cat and a mouse. During the whole movie, I was waiting for a scene where Robert Pattinson eats Kristen Stewart. If this is your understanding of love, go ahead and watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
When you can live forever what do you live for?,"Keep in mind that I am reviewing this movie as someone who read the book, so if you disagree with what I think then you are someone who either has read the book or someone who has not read it. If you are a fan of the book, you will either like it or dislike it, and if you have not read the book, you will either dislike it or think it is just ok.Kristen Stewart's performance as Bella Swan is not spectacular or anything, but as someone who has read the book, she was a bit close to how the book had the character. Robert Pattinson as Edward Cullen was also not that bad, he was also close to how the book made him even if some scenes they recreate with him can be weird.A little issue would be that they go through scenes that were in the book quickly, and they can be edited together in a weird way. When they do the scenes from the book, they can look cool sometimes involving the vampires are doing things with their abilities but can also look weird because of the effects.Some scenes will be out of order in how the book portrayed them, but it did not bother me that much. I thought the effects on the vampires would sometimes look silly looking, mostly because whenever the vampires move fast or do things really fast it can look weird in how it is shown even though they do it how the book describes.Twilight (2008) was not a bad movie adaptation, just read the book beforehand so you can understand it and the scenes they cut out.

Toothless nonsense...,"The Mormon allegory about resisting sexual impulses finally reaches the big screen with Twilight. This is, of course, the film adaptation of Stephanie Meyer's teen sensation novel and should be the first of about four in the series. Directed by Catherine Hardwicke, this bit of cornball vampire-romance schlock is the buzz of the preteen-to-teen set and the talk of everyone who hasn't seen another vampire movie or read another vampire book, like, ever.Kristen Stewart stars as Bella, perhaps one of the most annoying protagonists put to film in 2008. She's a dreary, gawky, breathy teen with no personality and nothing to latch on to from a cinematic perspective. Bella moves to Forks, which according to Meyer's book is an incredible rainy locale, and lives with her father on the rugged Washington coast. She heads to a new school, where apparently every student has read her bio before her arrival, and makes friends easily despite having no discernible social skills and no actual likable qualities.Eventually Bella discovers the one and only Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) in biology class. She is drawn to him instantly, as he is to her. Their breathless exchanges, their constant blinking and biting of lips, and their mumbled phrases abruptly blossom into a romance for the ages. One catch, of course, is that Edward is a vampire desperately trying to resist his ""thirst"" for Bella. Bella, on the other hand, seems to have no problem putting Edward through absolute hell if it means she can be with him.We meet Edward's family, a strange crew of pale-faced nobodies, and a plot develops in which another vampire thirsts after Bella. Edward and his family only consume animal blood, thus making them vegetarians. Go figure. With Edward and Co. resisting the blood of Bella, they find time to play baseball and hang out with her. They take to her right away, just like Edward did, and soon enough they're risking it all to protect her from vampires who in reality do nosh on human blood.Twilight carries on a basic idea of denial in that the ""good"" vampires manage to rebuff their instinctive longing for blood and apparently never take human blood no matter how burly the impulses are. No matter how much heavy breathing Bella does, no matter how much she bites her lip, and no matter how much she mumbles over her words in that mouth- watering adolescent way, Edward doesn't dare move from his staunch position of abstemiousness.As a film, Twilight is terrible. The performances are awful from top to bottom, with negligible flashes of actual personality and life from the characters. Performers mumble, stumble, and stagger around the screen in an attempt to introduce us to these characters, but nothing really takes hold and the end results are colourless and ripe for Airplane!-style satire. Stewart inhabits Bella with such breathiness, such irritation, and such idiocy that one has trouble feeling any concern for her character at all. After all, why would we?Pattinson might look the part, I suppose, as Edward, but he sure as hell does little to act the part. His is the most unexciting vampire of all time, I daresay. Part of this is Meyer's fault, sure, as Pattinson can't help the ridiculousness of ""getting all shiny"" when the sun comes out or the daft logistics of sucking the blood out of a deer. Pattinson's leering, gloomy, mind-numbing performance does little to drum up interest in the character beyond the phony morons of the eighth grade.But enough is enough. Let's set aside the pitiable constitution of the motion picture for a moment. Let's ignore the fact that the movie manages to leave its established first person set-up to explore a pair of scenes that we really don't need to see. Let's pretend we never saw Bella shake a squeezable ketchup bottle. Let's imagine that the soundtrack wasn't a sweltering turd of tacky music set at the worst conceivable times. Let's imagine the movie had even one segment with some humour or wit. And let's pretend that the closing credits weren't among the most ostentatious and garish of all time.What we're left with are the bones of a poor vampire movie that attempts to teach us a lesson about self-abnegation. It's about negating desires, about resisting life, about abstaining from impulses. This may or may not be a laudable message, depending on where your morality lies. But one thing Twilight and Stephanie Meyer's complete bleak, cowardly, decomposing empire is is a spineless and brainless excuse for literature. And it's a howling shame that this preposterous excuse for literature became a boring and dire excuse for a film.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Loved it back then.. Now... It's ok.,"Personally, since the 1st one (this 1) I feel if they all had better directors, they would've been even better.. Hands down, the CG for the entire series was killer. But they rushed this 1, Kristen or even Rob, messed up their lines (ergo Kristen's stuttering.) I remember when this 1st came out, I already knew who Kristen was, but I was disappointed the way they done her up in 1 & 2...Wishing they had chosen some 1 else, but I grew out of that stupidity instantly! Kristen Stewart is 1 of my favorite actresses now, & I feel that Rob won't ever surpass Twilight. Yes, Yes, he's done so many more roles, but none give him the attention Twilight did. Sorry Rob, I'm not feeling his ""Batman"" roles... But I respect these films, cause I was a big fan of them once, & I still love Bella & Edward!",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Caught me off-guard,"I usually hate vampire movies, and as a matter of fact I didn't even want to see it, but i was dragged to go and see it anyway. The movie was a vampire movie with a twist, loved the plot and thought the movie was great. It left me wanting to see more, if they bring a sequel i would definitely go and see it. Would recommend the movie to anyone. Have never read the books so I enjoyed the movie in all its glory.For those that commented on the actors makeup and all that other crap, are being ridiculous, who cares if the actors makeup wasn't perfect, it never is, its makeup! ANd for all the readers and other people that judged the movie didn't give it its rights. A lot of people didn't see the movie because people thought it was just another vampire movie. But for those average people that did were quite impressed, when i say normal i mean the people that aren't all obsessed with vampires and warlocks.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
It was okay!,"By the time I write this review, I have watched all the Twilight movies. I think the first one - all in all - is okay. Although I really do prefer Dracula I don't mind the sparkly take on vampires. At least it's a personal and original kind of vampire. Like Beauty and the Beast, it raises the question: ""Who actually is the monster?"" If there is a monster in Twilight, it's Bella. It really looks like she suffers from constant PMS. Plus she has a throat disease as she swallows a lot and the doctor told her to... Speak. Very. Slowly... And. Pause. A lot.What was a bit of a disappointment is that the moment the Cullen family steps into the mess hall you really instantly know they're vampires. But then it takes billions of missed classes and mysterious gazes before Bella actually realises. I'm pretty sure this is no spoiler for anyone.But I thought the Cullens were well done. They cast a number of good actors and actresses there. If the leading actress hadn't been such a disappointment, this probably would have made a good movie. I did enjoy it after all.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
bad protagonist with no feelings,"The twilight movie has everything to be good, but they created a protagonist with a strange shyness and leaves everything she says with an uncomfortable air and her actions without emotions do not give an air of a purposeful protagonist and her reactions presented do not have a human air there's no way to have a feeling of connection in the character because she's too salty a sausage water with no personality for teenagers to think they're just like Bella that was Bella's instinct to be someone teenagers want to be like, but Bella just delivers someone without personality for the film and even having action it is not possible to mirror in Bella the character does not intend to be y/n (y/n is a pop acronym for characters that people want to be)",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
It Is What It Is,"******Seven Out of Ten******Upset movie goers need lay off this film, as it's clearly billed as a teenage ""chic-flick"". So what do people expect when they go into to see the film? Gratuitous sex? Buckets of blood? Over the top profanity? Give me a break. ""Twilight"" lives up to exactly what it's billed as: A teenage vampire love story. I went expecting these things and received exactly that. The other major complaint registered by film goers relates to the way in which the vampires are portrayed: A much tamer, furrier version than most of us are accustomed to. I was fine with the vampire characteristics in ""Twilight""; it was a refreshing change of pace. Why in the hell do vampires need to be exactly the same in every horror film ever made? It's actually not a bad idea to tweek monster norms, in a day and age in American film inundated by terrible remakes and other recycled ideas. So just back off ""Twilight"" people and direct your criticism more appropriately at main stream studios refusing to financ√© any new budding horror creators or any fresh horror ideas that don't guarantee a fast buck.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Episode I - A New Cringe,"Twilight is a very moody, atmospheric movie. It's also filled with typical uncompromising young adult drama and rewrites vampires for a different kind of audience.The filter makes up most of the atmosphere, a lot of the scenes are done with tilts and strange angles that don't do much other than show off how tall Robert Pattinson is compared to Kristen Stewart. A lot of vampire lore gets majorly rewritten or forgotten, with the sun apparently making vampires glimmer rather than burn, they show up in mirrors and photos now, and their emotional lust is significantly stronger than their hunger. The performances are either bad or abstract but I'm gonna safely assume this movie isn't as artsy as it might appear, with acting ranging from wooden to wacky to somewhere strangely in-between. The story is pretty straightforward with such orchestrated drama it feels tailored for its impressionable audience with this outsider who falls for a threatening, brooding, loner that turns out to be apart of a family of semi-friendly vampires.Overall, it is what it is, and what it is isn't a great movie, however isn't nearly as awful as you'd expect, but so far removed from the typical vampire archetype that it's appeal is a unique taste that isn't for everyone.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
What was I thinking?,"Rewatched this again, I was obsessed when the movie first came out. I had read the book too. But, I cringed the whole time I rewatched the movie. It feels very forced, the line delivery between Bella and Edward is awkward and the timing is off. It's like they're spitting lines at each other, it doesn't have a natural flow like conversation. Also, the over acting, oh my god. I cringed so hard when Bella walked into that Biology class for the first time. The supporting actors are what keeps the movie afloat. The movie fails to bring the passion, romance and obsession to life that is so vivid in the book. It does excel at keeping the line and dialogue very close to the books but that's it.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Take it at face value,"I may have rated it a 7, because that's my overall consensus, but I absolutely adore this movie. I know all you kids think you're hip or cool because you're too edgy to watch twilight. You only watch ""real"" movies. ""This is so unfaithful to vampire movies"". ""Kristen Stewart cant act, omg!"" ""It's so cheesy and clich√©.""I roll my eyes every time I have to read a review about how you rolled your eyes at the film. Watching twilight, for me, was kind of like being sprinkled with pixie dust. It just feels like something magical. If you're going to be obnoxious and start tearing the film apart to compare it to much better pieces, you're going to come out short. Twilight is no cinematic masterpiece, but it is an epic love story. The movie is very cheesy and very clich√© and these things works to it's advantage. It isn't trying to be something more than a fantastical movie about a girl falling in love with a supernatural being and all the glitter that surrounds it. If you take the movie at face value and stop comparing it to better pieces, because that's not at all how you watch a movie (morons.), Then you'll definitely enjoy twilight.Fyi if you're one of those people who likes to jab Kristen Stewart, I find myself again rolling my eyes. She's an incredible actress, you just have no taste in films. Have you even seen cafe society? Clouds of sils Maria? Personal shopper? Goddamnit, ADVENTURELAND was released around the same time as twilight and it was freaking brilliant. Acting isn't about giving an Oscar worthy performance every time the camera pans to you, it's about fully embodying a character, and she nails Bella as an iconic character in an iconic movie, whether you agree or not.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Lackluster Monster Mash,"Setting the trend for young adult romance films, Twilight truly altered the film industry for the next decade. Adapting the YA novel of the same name, author Stephanie Meyer set out to capture the honest feelings of adolescence, while mixing in some sci-fi elements. While the story came to her in a dream, the lasting impacts of the franchise impacted the dreams of millions of girls around the world.After her mother heads abroad, Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) is sent to spend a semester at her father's house in Forks, Washington. Attempting to adjust to her new life, she has trouble feeling at home until she meets a mysterious new friend, Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). Though peculiar and avoidant, Bella persists in breaking through his shell and discovering his secrets. When that secret lands her in the middle of a vampiric family & feud, Bella & Edward must fight for their love, as well as their lives.While Twilight mixes supernatural elements with a Romeo & Juliet-esque story, it fails to bring either to its full potential. The romantic aspects are trivial and childish, with very little chemistry shared by the characters. Although it is intended for young adults, the romance is difficult to believe and never fully sells itself to the audience. Tamer than their Transylvanian ancestors, the supernatural elements fall just short of being interesting. Stripping down the creatures to humanize them, Twilight misses the mark on vampires and ends up with socially awkward parkour enthusiasts.Though the young leads had quite a few feature films under their belts by this point, neither one could manage to create enjoyable performances out of this script. Feeling stoic, confused, and expressionless, both characters, and their relationship were difficult to root for. Accompanied by side characters who deliver equal or worse performances, the cast struggles to add any levity to the poorly written script.With boring characters, messy effects, and an uninspired script, Twilight fails to create a memorable film. While it will remain culturally relevant for years to come, Twilight disappointingly delivers a lackluster monster mash.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
