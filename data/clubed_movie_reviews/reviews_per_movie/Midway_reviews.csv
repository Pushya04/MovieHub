Account of Crucial Naval Battle in Emmerich Style,"This film is a straightforward retelling of the events in the first months of the War in the Pacific beginning with Pearl Harbor and culminating in the Battle of Midway (June 1942). In between, it also touched on Doolittle's Raid on Tokyo (April 1942) and the Battle of Coral Sea (May 1942). The story was told mainly from the point of view of two American soldiers, namely pilot Lt. Dick Best (Ed Skrein) who led his dive bomber squadron at Midway, and intelligence officer Lt. Comm. Edwin Layton (Patrick Wilson) who with his code-breaker team predicted the Midway attack.Along the way, we meet other famous American soldiers: Admiral Chester Nimitz (Woody Harrelson) Commander in Chief of the US Pacific Fleet; Vice Admiral William ""Bull"" Halsey (Dennis Quaid) who led the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise; Rear Admiral Raymond Spruance (Jake Weber) who took over the Enterprise for the Battle of Midway; Best's fellow aviators Lt. Comm. Wade McClusky (Luke Evans), Lt. Comm. Eugene Lindsey (Darren Criss) and Lt. Comm. Jimmy Doolittle (Aaron Eckhart); cryptographer Commander Joseph Rochefort (Brennan Brown) and Aviation Machinist Mate Bruno Gaido (Nick Jonas).The side of the Japanese Imperial Army and their unique military culture were also given fair screen time in this film. Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto (Etsushi Toyokawa) of the Imperial Japanese Navy and the Commander in Chief of their combined fleet, was portrayed with calm and quiet dignity. We also get to meet other Japanese officers and their own brands of leadership Rear Admiral Tamon Yamaguchi (Tadanobu Asano) who commanded the Hiryu with nobility, and Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo (Jun Kunimura) whose controversial battle decisions had negative impact against the Japanese campaign.The execution of the critical battle scenes are the main draws to watch this film. Director Roland Emmerich will always be remembered as the man who brought us ""Independence Day"" (1996) and ""2012"" (2009). Of course, there are big explosions and massive destruction here as well. The massive scenes showing fiery exploding seacraft and aircraft were rendered with crisp cinematography and meticulous visual effects to create impressive screen spectacles. The aviation scenes, particularly the dive bomber runs by Dick Best, were excellently staged, shot and edited to elicit an exhilarating rush.For its 2 hours 18 minute run, the story of the crucial naval battles and the heroism of its real-life protagonists were front and center here in ""Midway."" There were no fictional characters or cheesy love stories like in the first ""Midway"" film or ""Pearl Harbor."" While seeing some popular young actors like Criss or Jonas can be distracting, the all-star cast generally rendered honor and respect to the heroes they portrayed. Focusing on soldiers of lesser rank allowed for some intimate personal drama in actual battle situations, perhaps with not much depth as possible. As this movie is rated PG, so do not expect to see graphic injuries at the level of ""Saving Private Ryan.""",8.0,Anonymous,History
Both good and disappointing - depends on the target audience,"As someone very knowledgeable about the subject, I was somewhat disappointed. Whether it was the wrinkled uniforms, the painful dialogue, the over-the-top dramatics and exaggerated explosions (hey, it's Emmerich!)... it was clear the film was not made for people like me who know the details and the characters very well.The rating depends greatly on the target audience. It's clear this film was made for a younger audience, and as such, it does a very good job of conveying the history quite accurately. It's a lot to take on with a 2:20 movie (complete with a 6-month summary of events leading up to the title battle) and it does a fine job of that.Correct history of this great nation tragically just isn't taught anymore, so I heartily applaud any effort to do so. I just wonder if younger audiences have any desire to learn it. So if I'm rating from that perspective, it jumps up a few points.I just wish a little more care with the details and script had been taken to leave the older audience satisfied from our knowledge level.",6.0,Anonymous,History
More than you'd expect,"Critics are trashing this film, I went into it skeptical. After, I'm not so sure why. They tell a simplified story of the events leading up to, and eventually the battle of midway. You get to see two sides of life, the Japanese and the American forces. The script is fine, acting is pretty good in my opinion as well (shout out to Dennis Quaid, he is a great salty kinda guy). CGI was not that bad, especially for fast paced scenes. Only complaint is it is a bit long, which I understand due to how much they wanted to include. But there were 2-3 times I thought it might end, but there were still a few minutes left. In the end, a solid war movie that, in my opinion, does a great job showing some brutality of war, in addition to brothership and slice of life of the time. A solid film to honor the brave men and women that died for a better future.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Poorly written dialogue,"Especially when it comes to Ed Skrein's lines, the writing of this script was so bad. Attempts at drama come off as embarrassing.

Feels like a made-for-TV movie,"Midway feels like a made-for-TV movie. It's full of cliched dialogue, acting, and plot points. When most of your movie hinges on the lead actor's performance, and that performance turns out to be melodramatic and cheesy, you've got a problem. Also, the visual effects were inconsistent, swinging from impressive to corny. This isn't a bad movie, but it's going to be easy for me to forget about it.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Better then I thought it would be,"Midway delivers a solid, visually striking depiction of one of World War II's most pivotal battles. Directed by Roland Emmerich, the film is packed with breathtaking aerial combat scenes, impressive special effects, and a clear respect for the historical significance of the events it portrays.The standout feature of Midway is its dedication to historical accuracy. From the strategic decisions to the portrayal of key figures like Admiral Chester Nimitz (Woody Harrelson) and Lt. Dick Best (Ed Skrein), the film successfully immerses viewers in the high stakes of the Pacific Theater. The cast does a commendable job, with standout performances from Harrelson and Dennis Quaid, although some dialogue can feel a bit stiff and overly dramatic at times.While the action scenes are gripping, the movie's pacing struggles in places. The focus on numerous characters and events, while admirable for its scope, can feel overwhelming and disjointed, leaving some storylines underdeveloped.Overall, Midway is a respectful and thrilling tribute to the bravery of those who fought in the Battle of Midway. While it doesn't quite reach the emotional depth of films like Saving Private Ryan, its action-packed sequences and historical focus make it a worthy watch for fans of war movies and history buffs.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Hollywood actually made a decent war movie without pushing a political agenda,"This is probably the first time in over 50 years Hollywood made a solid war movie without inserting a sappy, contrived romantic sub-plot, pushing some radical political agenda, or re-writing history.
The movie is good. The dialogue is believable, natural, and convincingly delivered in almost all cases.While no movie is perfectly accurate historically - historians don't even agree on much, so who is to say - the few errors here are trivial and immaterial to the how events progressed. As somebody who is a buff on this period of the early Pacific war - reading every book by Prange, Lord, and many others - I was very impressed.I went into this movie expecting the worst from Hollywood, but this was their best historical piece in generations. Even the casting seemed to echo the real people in looks and demeanor.The Japanese point of view wasn't neglected either. While I can't say whether the Japanese dialogue was believable or well-delivered, by all outward appearances this acting was also top notch. The similarity between the real Admiral Nagumo and the actor was particularly striking. They made the right call in using solid Japanese actors speaking Japanese.The accurate portrayal of the friction between the Imperial Navy and Imperial Army with Emperor Hirohito almost powerless to restrain the militarists was very refreshing. This was a very important, complex contributing factor to the war. Few outside Japan and some narrow historical circles ever learn about this dynamic.About the worst I can say about this movie is the pace was too fast. Unless stretched into an 8 hour mini-series, I can't imagine they could have avoided this. With my background, I could fill in gaps and context the movie seemed to miss. Others might be left confused. Even though not well-read on this chapter of history, my spouse followed the storyline without issue and really enjoyed the movie as entertainment.Kudos to the producers, writers, actors, and entire crew. This was a job well-done and a fitting tribute to heroes like Layton and Best.",9.0,Anonymous,History
You sunk my battleship!,"Midway is not just the name of the place where a historic WWII sea battle took place between the Americans and the Japanese, it's also the point in this film where I realised I didn't know what was going on. Director Roland Emmerich (Godzilla, Independence Day, 2012) is obviously no slouch when it comes to action scenes, bringing us some truly astonishing battle sequences that provide much bang for your buck, but he struggles to tell his complex historical story with any coherence.As the movie cuts back and forth between the American and Japanese forces, with numerous ships, locations, characters, and much detailed wartime strategy to take in, it's easy to lose track of what's what and, more importantly, who is who, making it hard to feel anything when they meet their inevitable fate in a ball of flames and twisted metal (the most emotional part of the whole film comes right at the end when photos with captions show the real-life people who were instrumental in the battle).Of course, those who are watching, not for a history lesson or for heart-rending pathos, but for thrilling scenes of destruction and derring-do, are more than catered for with countless huge explosions, plenty of machine-gun fire and loads of impressive aerial combat. While most of this is realised through the use of CGI, it's well-handled and, for the most part, very convincing.5.5/10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb.",6.0,Anonymous,History
GREAT WATCH!!!!!,I am a veteran and this was a hit. The special effects were good and I don't understand why people were saying it was too much. The characters were evenly played out in the movie and there was no stupid romance part that was in the last Pearl Harbor movie. It told the story amazingly and it dived right into what it's all about. You don't need too much character development to tell a story of four people during that time. It was such a great watch and I Definatley recommend it. It ranks up there as we were soldiers! It's been a long time a good war movie came out and this was it. And when you see other reviews about it's a disgrace to veterans don't listen to those reviews. Obviously they haven't been through tough times such as how these people lived. I was in live fire so I can compare. Enjoy the movie is amazing!,10.0,Anonymous,History
Better than the 1976 version.,"While I know a lot of reviewers liked the 1976 version of ""Midway"", for someone who knows about aircraft, it's a frustrating film. Again and again and again, the film uses old footage...much of which show planes which never fought at this famous sea battle! And, in a few cases, you'd see fighter planes turn into dive bombers and the like....all due to sloppy editing and a 'it's good enough' attitude. Because of this, I strongly recommend you see the 2019 version, which gets around this issue by using CGI...and modern CGI is incredible and looks real. Well made, but not perfect, but a very good film for folks who are interested in war films and history.By the way, I wrote a review for this a few months ago and it never appeared on this site. It was much more detailed...but I just haven't seen it recently enough to review it more in depth.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Unbelievable,"Abundant, not-quite-realistic computer-generated images make Midway look more like a video game than a depiction of real-life events. The overuse of subpar effects is the most dominant - but hardly the only - problem dogging this film. Epic war stories are difficult to tell without focusing on a few characters. This film unsuccessfully juggles too many plot threads and too many characters to keep an emotional anchor to the simulated events unfolding. Woody Harrelson is outstanding, but other cast members cannot overcome the limitations of the material and the challenges of acting on computer-generated sets.",5.0,Anonymous,History

Excellent Movie and Historically Accurate,"This is an excellent historical portrayal of the Battle of Midway, and some of the events that led up to it. There is a lot of intensity throughout the film, and it shows how some of the decisions on both sides were truly a gamble in that time. There were no satellites, gps systems, or sophisticated radar systems. The only missing pieces to this movie, as noted by others, is the lack of US fighter planes. Maybe it is intended to focus mainly on the Dauntless pilots.
I took my wife and kids to see this movie, as it seems much of the history of this country is being forgotten. I am so glad I did. The kids had no idea that any of this happened.
As for the critics that wrote negative reviews and trashed this movie, I think attributes to a lot of what is wrong with this country today. People who decided not to see this movie, on Veterans Day weekend, based on the critics reviews, are truly missing an excellent movie.
This movie is historically accurate, with no lame love story, or fictional substories.",10.0,Anonymous,History
ABSOLUTELY SEE IT,"I've read several of the critical reviews of ""Midway""; they seem to reveal more about the cattiness of the reviewer than any understanding of the movie, or its message.
I am part of the growing legion of American moviegoers who have pretty much given up on Hollywierd having any clue how to convince me to actually care enough about any of their offerings to part with the price of admission. I can wait a few months till they show up free on Youtube to confirm my suspicions that I haven't wasted my money.
I made the rare exception this weekend to see ""Midway"", because I'm a history buff, and the previews I'd seen showed promise that the story would be properly told. That said, I went in with the full expectation that it might fail my already low expectations.
Happy to say that it far exceeded my best hopes. Roland Emmerich has put together a gripping storyline that manages to get in all the important elements of an epic story in 128 minutes. For the story of the American victory at Midway is an epic tale that every American should become familiar with.
Few Americans today can fathom what dire straits the US found itself in in 1942: Our battleships lay in twisted ruins on the bottom of Pearl Harbor; we had four aircraft carriers facing a Japanese navy with twelve, equipped with aircraft which were far superior to anything that was then available to American fliers; those aircraft were piloted by experienced men who had honed their craft in four years of war in China. We helplessly watched as thousands of American soldiers, sailors and Marines in the Pacific Islands and the Philippines were made captive, beyond the reach of our aid.
All the Japanese had to do was to concentrate on Midway, overwhelm our inferior naval and air forces, and Hawaii and the West Coast would be wholly at their mercy.
The essayist Matthew Arnold once said, ""Have something to say, and say it as clearly as you can. That is all anyone needs to know about style."" Emmerich follows his advice. No actors involved in ""Midway"" will be nominated for an Oscar. Which is another way of saying that there are no star turns which detract from telling the story. I will say that the actors are very believable in their roles; as the son of a Marine who fought in the Pacific, I found their portrayals pretty convincing.
I'm firmly of the opinion that CGI effects are overused to distract from thin or non-existent plotlines. I credit Emmerich for using them to reinforce an already strong narrative. To those critics who found them overpowering, I inquire: How in hell do you think the shock of modern warfare registered on the men who actually faced it at Pearl Harbor and Midway? They called it ""shell shock"" for a damned good reason.",9.0,Anonymous,History
E for effort,"There is a lot of good stuff in ""Midway"". But for some reason, it doesn't work as well as it should have. One problem is the look of the movie. It took me quite a while to get used to it. A lot of the movie doesn't look real. A little actual location photography would have gone a long way. The characters were another problem. In real life these men were great heroes but in the movie they weren't that interesting. ""Midway"" does have its fair share of excitement. There's no denying that. It's just that, overall, this movie misses the mark.",6.0,Anonymous,History

A commendable effort but needs a longer directors cut - RELEASE IT PLEASE,"Midway is well made thrown back to the historical war movie epics of the 1960s and 1970s, covering a wide spectrum of elements that made up a key moment in history. It's not a perfect film, but its one of the best of its type to be made in a good long while.What MIDWAY provides us with is an ensemble piece narrative story covering events leading up to the turning point in The War In The Pacific, which was the battle of Midway. To invest us in the characters we're shown a snapshot journey of each of their lives from just before the attack on Pearl Harbour in December 1941 up until June of 1942 where the Japanese and American naval forces would try and surprise each other in what would be the battle of the films title. It's no easy feat to present us with a vast range of uniformed characters in the military, and get the viewer invested in them emotionally but the actors here to do well to make each of their characters stand out so when the film reaches its key climax we understand who is who and what their role is in the conflict. While some of the dialogue is obvious and overstated it serves the job with character dialogue scenes acting as segways from one historical stepping stone to the next as we follow the events that led up to the battle.Before I delve into the main negative, I will say overall this is a great movie which could be really enhanced by an extended edition or extra running time if if there's more scenes that were cut out covering the battle of Midway itself - and if so PLEASE PUT THEM BACK IN A LONGER CUT - PEOPLE WILL BUY IT ON BLU-RAY! This is where the main problem with this film lies. Over half of its running time is dedicated to the raid on Pearl Harbour, The Doolittle Raid and the battles leading up to and including The Coral Sea, the latter of which is told pretty much in one scene and a single VFX shot (Good though it was) - Not an issue per say, as this film is not called 'The Battle of The Coral Sea' - and while some of these scenes give much context and required emotional threads for both characters and the younger audience members alike, others really didn't need to be seen in this film. It felt as if the events surrounding the Chinese assisting the Doolittle Raid survivors was probably a condition of some VFX funding tax break for the Asian based post-production budget. An allied radio report of the raid itself, perhaps being heard by the pilots of the American carriers was really all that was needed. Whatever the reason, these scenes add little to the key story or characters involved in the subsequent battle and even though they sign post the path that led to Midway, it's not something that couldn't have been covered in a single title card at the beginning of the film. The battle of Midway itself, while well realised, is told a little too quickly. The Japanese attack on USS Yorktown is again covered in a single VFX shot with one line of dialogue from an observing carrier when it could have been such a nail biting moment. The tension that is achieved in the original movie between the Naval Commanders on both sides making the tricky tactical decisions in the battle is a little compacted here. We see the last batch of Japanese pilots taking off but we don't see the outcome of this decision nor get a sense of the damage they do to the Americans. Time spent earlier in the movie building up to events at Midway would have been better spent covering the key events of the actual battle itself, which though nicely staged, feels a little rushed at times. Although a fistful of scenes give us the Japanese perspective they don't show would have been crucial moments of drama such as the belief that their single strike on the Yorktown gave way to believed rumours that two American carriers had been sunk, and the initial spotting of the American fleet by their pilots is not shown at all.That said the stakes of the climatic battle are well realised here and the CGI is NOT poor, nor distracting as others have claimed, it is extremely well done and is far more effective and real on the big screen. You forget your watching visual FX after a point, which one assumes, is the whole idea. Where the earlier Midway film failed in its visuals of the battle, here you're really put in the seat of the plunging dive bomber or on the deck of the carrier during the numerous actions. It is a visceral experience to see these sequences on the big screen and one that shouldn't be missed.Credit too must go to Casting Director ANDREA KENYON. It can't have been easy to get such a great ensemble of actors together for one picture (the scheduling must have been a nightmare) and the scale of the film certainly demands and receives a top quality line-up. Ed Skrein is appropriately cocky as pilot Dick Best, while Patrick Wilson adds appropriate gravitas as the intelligence officer whose warnings about an imminent Japanese attack were previously ignored. They're backed up by an engaging Woody Harrelson, Dennis Quaid and the criminally underused Mark Rolston, who are all excellent playing the senior officers, while the younger cast including Keean Johnson, Nick Jonas, Luke Kleintank and Daren Criss, all do well to make the most of their parts. Given their limited screen time, credit must also be given to the Japanese cast - It says a great deal that the scene where Rear Admiral Yamaguchi elects to go down with his ship is one of the most moving in the film and creates much sympathy for the Japanese navy who were against the war with the USA from the very beginning. (Their evil actions depicted elsewhere are not spared however ,with the execution of American POWs gruesomely depicted)Director Roland Emmerich, whilst having made some past turkeys, is an extremely competent film maker who can handle both scale, multiple characters and action sequences without them turning into an unwatchable 'what the hell is happening now' Micheal Bay snoozefest. We can tell what is happening to whom and there is always a sense of where things are taking place and why in relation to the story. Dialogue is functional to mediocre so while not a flawless film, I have no doubt that several scenes were cut to make sure the film hit a manageable running time. There is a huge thirst for well made historical epics set within this time peroid and a strongly urge both the film makers and the studio to release a longer version of the film on other formats, especially if it covers more aspects of the later battle. This will push what is already a good film to the next level.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Too many visual errors,"I have watched ""Midway"" several times now and I must admit I enjoyed it but unfortunately being interested in naval history and particularly the Pacific theatre I was disappointed by some of the glaring visual mistakes throughout the film. At the beginning of the film Layton asks a British officer if he would ""miss this place when you're gone"". The British officer replies that he hopes the nest time he sees the ""little buggers"" would be ""through the sights of a 14-inch gun. This scene was set in 1937 when the British had not yet had any plans for a 14-inch naval gun. Also at the banquet where Layton talks with Yamamoto, there is a picture on the wall behind Layton of the aircraft carrier ""Hiryu"" at sea. This ship was not completed till 1939. The Pearl Harbor attack sequence at the beginning of the movie also showed some glaring mistakes. Torpedoes being launched from ahead of the ships. Ships moored outboard capsizing to starboard. The ""Arizona"" apparently capsizing and every ship seems to be ""Pennsylvania"" class. The ""Lexington"" in the Coral Sea sequence is shown as a ""Yorktown"" class carrier when in fact she was a much larger vessel. Records show that McCluskey dived on the ""Kaga"". This ship had it's island superstructure on the conventional starboard side but is shown in the film as having it on the port side. In my opinion these errors could have been overcome with a bit more careful use of cgi. Apart from that I must admit to enjoying the film.",6.0,Anonymous,History
what a great solid movie,"Agree with other reviewer, this is the best war movie in a long time, it went through three historical events, attack on pearl harbor, doolittle Tokyo air raid and battle of midway linked together with a human story of a dive bomber pilot, and what a great history/story telling it was.
The beginning of the massive Enterprise aircraft carrier, shaking the theater with the Dolby sound has the feel of Star War IV Battle cruiser opening scene, and a tight story line and pace ensues. The CGI is the best, you don't see AT-6 Texan painted as Zero fighters, you don't see modern warships disguised as battle-hardened WW2 ones,from this point forward I predict we will see more movies with period-correct war machines. The movie has moments that make you sigh (dud torpedo that hit but didn't explode, bombs missed after pilot braved through clouds of flaks) and cheer (bulls-eyed on the giant Sun on the deck, and chain explosion of the littered ammos because of tactic confusions), this is Hollywood at its best in rare moments, no over lingering love story, no cliche stereotyped GIs, what you have are characters in a war trying to survive, trying to outsmart the other side, and trying but dying ... you can read about those three events before or after the movie, but for me, I enjoyed a great movie, finished till the credit ends and walked out feeling great, grateful and blessed as an American.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Some good stars but all lacking any sense of believable performance, with a script that lacked narrative, coherence or direction just lots of cliches and other words. Given the Historic event and the heroism associated with it, just how Emmerich managed to produce something so uninspiring and lifeless is beyond me. The back and forth between the front and the home is laughable. Cardboard cut out Japanese characters and superficial un-engaging American heroes were boring, the action sequences overblown and exaggerated up-to and including planes flying through wave tips and the wreckage of other planes only to emerge unscathed, combined to stretch credibility to beyond breaking point. 2hrs and 18 mins of my life that I will never get back.",3.0,Anonymous,History

old style war epic,"It's 1937 Tokyo. Japanese Admiral Yamamoto wants assistant naval attaché Edwin Layton (Patrick Wilson) to pass on a message. Do not back Japan into a corner. The two countries would go to war 4 years later. The movie follows the major military events in the Pacific all the way to the epic battle at Midway.It's an old style war epic. It's pretty standard retelling most of the main stories. The submarine is probably the only one that I've never seen on film although I did hear it mentioned once upon a time. I assume that they have maintain the accuracy of the various aerial fights while heightening the action. The CGI looks about a generation behind. Some of the events show up more as highlights. Some of it looks broad and melodramatic. All in all, it's a war movie from another era from the style to the writing. Director Roland Emmerich may be on the downside of his career.

Just don't bother,"Oof this movie had a lot of potential and was a bigger disappointment than I was expecting. It had so much going for it too that it should have been much better than it ended up being.The movie had its good points along with its draw backs though. The cast of this film was outstanding and I was pleasantly surprised every time a new big name actor popped up on screen, I was really not expecting that. But even with all that star power the movie fell short, the overwhelming cast is really the only big positive for this film and the general historical story that it told.The movie does cover much much more than just the battle of Midway and jumps around quite a bit. That wasn't bad necessarily but it left you trying to follow lots of major events that happened during World War 2. This could be perfectly fine if done a little better but over all was not the end of the world.The two biggest things that were the downfall of this movie were the main character and the general look of the film. Ed Skrein is absolutely abysmal in this movie, his acting was bad, the depiction of a historical figure was terrible and the fake accent he was trying to do was just grating in all regards. He was such a bad choice for this film and brought down the stellar performances of all the much more seasoned and proven actors who were in this.The movie is almost all done CGI which was to be expected after all but it looks so cartoonish and bad. The entire time I was watching it I was wondering how this new film could make this all look so bad when it had been done in the past and looked so much better. The best example would be Pearl Harbor from 2001. That film used CGI as well but it looked so much better. I wish who ever had been in charge of visuals for that movie had done this one too. It took you out of the epic events that they were showing.If you are in the mood for a good World War 2 movie look else where.

Neither low nor high (way),"This is star studded, as was the movie it is based on. While the original used some original footage (of the war), this has visuals to reel you in. Whatever else you may think of the movie, it looks fantastic. And while the star power might be almost the same, it never really reaches the coolness of the original. Still a lot of known faces to enjoy. And a lot more patriotism than the original too. Which some may find weird, considering there's a German director, but he has proven to be more American, than Americans themselves at times, if you look at his filmography and the movies he made.Having said all that, this should not have been the massive financial flop it was (apparently). But maybe people were not ready or in the mood for something like this. Who really knows? Emmerich has produced/directed a lot of movies that are entertaining as they are patriotic.

The cast is well known and undertake their roles with the respect that the subject matter deserves.Thankfully there is no love story as with the 1970s Midway or Pearl Habor and in this respect it plays more like a docudrama as with Tora Tora Tora (an excellent choice in my view).For me, the only thing which lets the film down on occasion is the special effects which look a wee bit like a computer game.Having said that, this is an excellent attempt and no doubt like Tora Tora Tora will be appreciated more in the future.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Lots of action to make this worth watching but lacking in a good script.,"Midway (3 out of 5 stars).Midway is a fair war film delivered by Roland Emmerich who makes films that are big blockbuster action movies. Midway is not a great war movie or a great film in general. It delivers on plenty of action sequences with aerial combat. Realistically it is no Dunkirk with the realism on the practical stunts than having actors sit in a stage production with all visual effects. The visual effects are decent. The script lacks in delivering characters that stands out. The story was okay about the Battle of Midway. Roland Emmerich's focuses on building the action suspense but not leaving any satisfaction in the end. I feel like this film does make Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor feeling like a masterpiece when it comes to a story with a forced love story, better action and aerial combat that puts you on the edge of your seat, and the emotional impact you have with the victims and soldiers that was under attack.What worked great with Midway? Well for a war film, Roland Emmerich does pack a punch with having a lot action in it. The cinematography was good and making you feel like you are with the pilots in the fighter planes. The opening sequence with Pearl Harbor being attacked tried to set the tone of the film. It was not as powerful like Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor. The rest of the film focuses on Dick (Ed Skrein) flying in the air, and getting into a lot of aerial combat with the Japanese. Dick is a cowboy, and cocky personality who flies and living on the edge when he is dive bombing. Evantually, the action sequences with aerial scenes do get repetitive. Dick and his other fighters flying high and dive bombing into a Japanese carrier. Hoping their missiles hit their ships.The film has a great cast ensemble. Sadly, none of the actors have room to develop their characters. Ed Skrein, Woody Harrelson, Patrick Wilson, Luke Evans, Mandy Moore, Nick Jonas, and Aaron Eckhart. None of the characters have a characterization which makes them standout. The script lacks in delivering actual people who went through these events. Instead, the film makes every character forgettable.The plot about the battle of Midway is a great feature to be brought onto film. After Pearl Harbor, Americans sent out several carriers to aid in Midway. Which American fighter pilots were trying to stop the Japanese carriers from beginning another attack. The movie lacks in delivering an emotional story when it is too focused on bringing flat characters from one set piece to another. Then, having the repetitive aerial battle throughout the two hour time frame.Overall, Midway is a fair war film. It delivers a lot of action and aerial combat. The visual effects are a little decent. The actors are forgettable with their characters from a shallow script. The story is lacking emotional depth with the characters.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A Solid War Movie That Puts Characters Over FX,"The events of December 7th 1941 left an indelible mark on the psyche of America and became a date that truly has lived in infamy. Though historians, authors, and filmmakers have attempted to analyze the events during and leading to the attack on Pearl Harbor; there is still a great deal of interest about the attack and the aftermath.While Pearl Harbor was for many the opening shots of the U.S. entry into World War II; some would say that the stage was set earlier when the United States attempted to curtail what they saw as an aggressive and Imperialistic Japan by placing restrictions on their vital resources such as oil and the tonnage of their Navy.In the new film ""Midway"" we are given a glimpse into this when four years before the attack, when Edwin Layton (Patrick Wilson) meets with Admiral Nagumo (Jun Kunimura) who lets him know that hardline factions in his government have been buoyed by their invasion of China and will do what is needed to make sure the vital oil that is supplied by the U.S. remains constant.
Flash forward to the day of the attack and Layton who has warned that an attack was possible at Pearl Harbor is seeing his worst predictions come true. In the aftermath he is assigned to Admiral Nimitz (Woody Harrelson); who has been given the thankless task of taking charge of what is left of the Pacific Fleet and finding a way to stop the Japanese fleet.The U.S. finds themselves outnumbered, outgunned, and waging war with ships and planes that are inferior to the Japanese but they must find a way to overcome the great obstacles before them and defeat a relentless enemy.
Layton and a team of code breakers are convinced the Japanese intend to attack the island of Midway and go all in to set a trap with the goal of destroying the enemy carriers so the U.S. can gain an aerial advantage in the Pacific.With a strong cast which features Luke Evans, Dennis Quaid, Mandy Moore, Aaron Eckhart, Nick Jonas and a fine supporting cast, Director Roland Emmerich has given audiences a gripping war movie that despite the impressive visual effects; never loses site of the fact that this is a story of real people who found themselves in pivotal moments of history.The film also shows how the Japanese commanders had differing views of the Americans they fought. Some considered them to lack braveness while others admired their tenacity and were grateful that they had what they saw as inferior and outdated planes to attack them in.The film also does a great job showing the Doolittle Raid and how what from a military standpoint caused minor damage yet was a huge psychological boost as Japan believed they were immune from attack yet the American forces found a way to bomb Tokyo by the impossible task of using land based bombers off a carrier.The film is a great mix of human drama that shows not only the terrible toll of war but how a group of extraordinary individuals gave their all.4.5 stars out of 5",9.0,Anonymous,History
Adequate war movie with terribly clunky dialogue...,"This movie was a boiler-plate but satisfactory action movie, though weighed down by a poorly written, terribly constructed, and woodenly acted script, with some dialogue so clunky, I could almost see the words land on the ground with a thud as soon as they left the actors' mouths. It's filled with a cavalcade of young, nubile Hollywood hunks (Nick Jonas, Ed Skrein, Keean Johnson, Darrin Criss), as well as a smattering of grizzly veterans (Dennis Quaid, Woody Harrelson) and an openly gay actor (Luke Evans) successfully playing against type, and while it was just this side of jingoistic, it didn't demonize the Japanese as much as it could have. We probably enjoyed it more than we might have, having just watched the episode in the Netflix WWII docuseries about the battle. Definitely not the best war movie I've ever seen, but enjoyable enough so as not to be completely wretched (damning with faint praise, I know).",7.0,Anonymous,History

EPIC STORYTELLING ON A CONVEYOR BELT...!,"From Roland Emmerich (2012/Independence Day) comes his stylized (& albeit typically destructive take) on the famous skirmish between American & Japanese forces at sea. After making the fatal error in not believing the Japanese were going to strike Pearl Harbor, the Americans are determined to make a decisive attack on their foes by taking out their aircraft carriers (using dive bombing tactics). Using a plethora of CG imagery (some an eyesore, others impressive especially the aerial combat sequences) to depict the battle sequences, the film works whenever Emmerich decides to let the images speak for themselves but whenever the poor actors open their mouths to espouse obvious historical points in 40's twinged New Yawk accents, one's eye rolling can become a liability. Starring some Brits playing yanks like Ed Skrein (who's gunnery partner is played by Keean Johnson, they both were in Alita: Battle Angel) & Luke Evans & able support by Patrick Wilson, Woody Harrelson, Mandy Moore, Dennis Quaid, Aaron Eckhart, Nick Jonas & Darren Criss.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Hoped for something better,"This is a movie called Midway, but it does not get to Midway until about halfway through the 2 hour movie. It spends time at Pearl Harbor, and briefly hits on some other battles in the 6 months between Pearl Harbor and Midway.Because it spends an hour pre Midway and 1 hour at midway, the details are lost and become somewhat vague. For example, you are not really told or have a clue how many or which ships were at the battle from each side, or their losses. So unless your interest meant you read up on it before hand, or after, you are not aware of the size of the battle.
Same with the importance of the battle, it was turning point that had a massive impact on the rest of the war, but that is not really conveyed in the movie.My other thought was just how white the movie was. Not a single black dood. Sure i understand back then it was rarer, but one of the most incredible stories of the men at Pearl Harbor was an African American cook who jumped on a Browning machine gun and took down at least 4 enemy aircraft and maybe as many as 6.My other issue with the movie is that it seemed to show that just 3 men did everything, everyone else was brave and risked their lives, died valiantly, but ultimately was these three guys that did everything. Yes these three men went above and beyond that day, but heck, everyone else failed and died bravely apparently. Somehow lessened the sacrifice of everybody else.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Historical accuracy leads to an awesome movie!,"I had high expectations for this movie, and they were absolutely MET and EXCEEDED.In my opinion, ""Midway"" is the best and most historically-accurate WWII movie of recent memory, and it's one of the few that actually highlights the air war in the Pacific. The writers seemed to recognize that simply recreating this momentous series of events was an amazing story in-and-of itself, without wasting time on unnecessary drama and distractions.You can tell that the writers, producers and actors all paid close attention to maintaining historical accuracy throughout the film. From Pearl Harbor to Midway, they captured many of the key interesting and critical moments along the way. They also showed both the American and Japanese perspectives in an insightful and respectful manner, which only adds to the complexity of the story.Also, the action scenes will have anyone (history lover or not!) on the edge of their seats the whole time! I loved every moment showing the SBD Dauntlesses and the processes of dive bombing, and I enjoyed their portrayal of the Doolittle raid.Finally, the casting was great. Each actor portrayed his or her real-life counterpart in a masterful and poignant way.In short, I can't recommend this movie enough. It's incredibly important to remember the courage, daring and skill of the men and women who fought in WWII, today and every day.

Amateurish,"In May 1942 the Imperial Japanese Navy launches an attack on the island of Midway in the Pacific Ocean. Securing it will provide a base for operations against Pearl Harbour and ultimately allow them to attack the US west coast. However, US Navy Intelligence has worked out their plan. Admiral Chester Nimitz sends two US Task Groups with three aircraft carriers to set a trap for the Japanese fleet. What follows is one of the most important battles in history.Pretty weak. Being directed by Roland Emmerich (Independence Day, Godzilla 1998, The Patriot) I wasn't expecting too much but the reality is even worse. Incredibly unrealistic militarily with every war movie cliché and overdone gung ho-ness on display. The acting follows suit with some incredibly hammy, over-the-top performances, especially by Ed Skrein as Dick Best. Seems like the movie was made for people who like vivid explosions and expect military personnel to all act like cowboys.Even the CGI is a let-down, and this was one part of the film that I expected to be pretty good and was looking forward to. Yet the battle scenes largely look like a video game from 2005 (at best). Surely good CGI is a given in 2019, especially with the budget Emmerich had? Even the non-CGI stuff is badly done: everything seems too dimly lit. Surprisingly poor production values.There are some positives. The film moves at a good pace so is never dull and some lesser known details and characters of the battle are covered. I liked the fact that the presence of John Ford (the legendary Hollywood director) at Midway was covered.Overall though, even with low expectations it's still quite disappointing.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Good movie with a few glaring errors.,"First, the cast was great, especially Woody Harrelson as Chester Nimitz. The Battle scenes and the movie itself, were far superior to the 76 version, and they left out the lame love story. The two biggest errors were: Wade McCluskey loses his bomb due to an electrical arming error in his dauntless (he was also a dauntless pilot, but they did Hollywood it up a bit), and they never once showed an American fighter, which is a glaring omission. The F4F Wildcat was the fleet fighter at the time. Both it and the horrible Brewster Buffalo (flying from Midway) should have been present. The torpedo hitting a Japanese ship and failing was totally true, in fact, one broke up and floated, enabling Japanese sailors to use it to be rescued. This was thanks to the penny pinching of the US government before the war. Some authors I'll suggest are, Prange, Lord and Symonds if anyone wants to know more.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Midway,"Roland Emmerich's Midway is a loud brash World War 2 action film with plenty of CGI. The inspiration might had been Star Wars rather than actual events.After a prologue set in 1937 featuring Intelligence Officer Edwin T Layton (Patrick Wilson) and Japanese commander in chief Isoroku Yamamoto regarding Japan's increasing bellicose attitude. It then moves to the bombing of Pearl Harbour that marks America's entry into World War 2 and its aftermath.The American navy need to fight back and hotshot fighter pilot Dick Best (Ed Skrein) wants to take the fight to the Japs.Others like Layton and Admiral Chester Nimitz (Woody Harrelson) need to work out what the Japanese will do next and rely on their intelligence experts.The film has actual real life players but it tries to cram too much and instead concentrates on the gung ho antics of Best and fellow pilot Wade McClusky (Luke Evans) both with dodgy American accents.The subplot featuring Lt Col Doolittle (Aaron Eckhart) was of interest but it just faded away.At least Emmerich did not try to emulate Michael Bay's Pearl Harbour with an attempt to make an epic World War 2 love story. The scenes of domestic life is perfunctory, most of the characters are broadly brushed. The green screen work is very obvious.

The characters on the other hand were not very well written, you had youre tough guy, youre scared one and the new one. Nothing out of the ordinary.One aspect of the film that didnt appeal to me was the special effects, it was transparent how fake they were. It kind of ruined the viewing experience for me.

"Thankfully, not the sequel to Michael Bay's ""Pearl Harbor""","Out of all the battles of World War II that have been portrayed on the big - and small - screen, the Battle of Midway has been the among the most difficult to adapt. The battle itself consisted of a complex series of events spread out over hundreds of miles of ocean and spanning a period of several days. There are the technical challenges of depicting naval and aerial combat. And there was also a considerable amount of prologue leading up to the Battle of Midway involving episodes occurring around the Asia-Pacific theater.Any attempt to depict the Battle of Midway in a film setting is therefore going to face all of these challenges, and more. But all in all, Director Roland Emmerich does a fair job in balancing the history with dramatic interpretation.The strongest parts of this film were the battle sequences, particularly those involving the actual battle of Midway. It's interesting that Emmerich chose to focus more specifically on the USS Enterprise and particularly on the dive bombers of ""Bombing 6,"" and I think that this approach actually worked well. Unlike the 1976 version, some of the actual pilots of Bombing 6 (particularly Richard ""Dick"" Best and Wade McClusky) are portrayed extensively - and for the most part sensitively - in this version.The Japanese perspective is also largely portrayed respectfully in this film. One particularly moving scene involved the scuttling of the Hiryu and Rear Admiral Yamaguchi's decision to go down with his flagship.All of this being said, this version of the Midway Battle suffers from a number of issues. In particular, the movie drags at the beginning and then feels rushed at the end. I'm not sure if this movie really needed to depict Pearl Harbor, the Marshall Islands raid, and the Doolittle Raid in the detail that it did. And some of the actual Battle scenes felt rushed, with important details omitted (e.g. the contributions of the PBY Catalina search planes, which get a lot more mention in the 1976 version than this one).Generally speaking, the acting in this movie was good, although you can tell the actors who were really settling into their characters from the ones ""phoning it in.""In terms of historical accuracy, I did not detect any glaring errors or omissions. I could tell that certain episodes received special mention (perhaps due to the producers involved in this film). The Marshall Islands are not ""high"" islands like Tahiti or Hawai'i but low lying coral atolls like Midway. And as mentioned previously, certain scenes from the actual Battle of Midway were omitted or felt rushed.But overall, I enjoyed this film version of the Battle of Midway. To some degree, this version is more historically accurate than the 1976 version. There was quite a bit of CGI, but that's to be expected from a war film covering such an epic battle (and CGI is better than recycled war movie footage). And thankfully, this is not the ""sequel"" to Pearl Harbor that I was afraid this movie would be. If anything, this is the way they should've made Pearl Harbor, with all the romantic triangle story baloney minimized or thrown out.A Solid 8/10 (especially for the actual battle scenes)",8.0,Anonymous,History
Historically correct,"I understand the lack of enthusiasm for this movie from some of the reviewers. There are some issues with pacing, effects and character development. However, all of that fades against the historical accuracy of the movie, which I found very surprising, to be honest. And for a war movie that seeks to represent a single battle, that's the most important thing, and Midway excels in that. The only thing really bugging me are the horribly wrinkly uniforms - that could pass on a carrier six months at sea, but not ashore and in literally every situation and with every rank. Was the ironing budget so bad?",6.0,Anonymous,History
Cheesy,"I hated that this movie was so cheesy! They took a great battle victory and made it about special effects.

I score it around 6.8. Recommend it for war movie fans,"Not familiar with the details or the art of war used in the battle of Midway but I will definitely be checking it out after watching this film. After watching this film I can't even imagine how all those people felt in the midst of such a battle. Seems like something terrifying and that feeling of watching those men in battle is what makes me think it is a good war film. It seems to go into detail regarding the occurrences of the battle and the ones that lead to it with almost all of the main characters having really existed (unlike the character of Ben Affleck in Pear Harbour for example).
On the other hand, the dialogue at some point seems a little cartoonish with characters saying or even behaving like what I would see in a cartoon or anime. It's normal that in cinema you often see people not behaving or talking like you see in real life but the film seemed to exaggerate at times.
The CGI are sufficient to transmit the feeling but not nearly enough for a film with a battle of this scale and historical importance lol. At times it seemed like the characters were looking at a screen with a movie playing (especially during the Pearl Harbour bombing scene).
But all in all, I recommend it for people who like war and/or historical movies.",7.0,Anonymous,History
China's garbage on the Silverscreen,"I'm not sure what others believe constitute a good movie but this is far from it. The opening credits highlighted the Chinese producers/influences of this film and makes sense as the movie trudges along. The overall story-telling and lineage of the movie are very disjointed and fractured. It feels like they were trying to recreate the magic of Dunkirk but didn't have a clue how to implement that strategy. There are also scenes that have no place in the movie or add zero value,if anything they create more confusion as to what this movie is really about.
Moving on from the choppy story-telling, the character's are super one-dimensional and are in now way representative of members in the military. The lead character is your basic cowboy/maverick embodied in how others may view us or our military members. The only thing that saves the horrible character development is Woody Harrelson's portrayal of Nimitz.
One shining light in this whole mess of a film is the action scenes. If there is one thing they got right, it was this. We like our intense explosions and in-your-face camera shots as they zoom across the screen but this is even watered down by the cheap feel of the CGI.

A very good movie about remarkable individuals,"When I posted on Facebook I was seeing this movie, a friend asked me what I thought of it.I was surprised to answer that I thought it was wonderful.It really is.I am not a fan of historical war movies. I don't like war. I don't love the military. I'm more of a science fiction fanatic and Marvel groupie, but this movie is truly and surprisingly wonderful.As I told my friend who went with me, I often have trouble making sense of war movies. An example is Dunkirk. I just have a hard time understanding them because I'm not familiar with the military. Instead I often feel lost and confused.But this movie is engaging and engrossing. It provides a good combination of breathtaking action and personal stories. It's not overly patriotic. Its subject matter is interesting. And the acting... the acting is simply superb.There are a lot of characters to keep track of. A lot of men (no criticism here -- lets face it, this particular history is about male soldiers). A few of the characters stand out and you become invested in their survival. They are brilliant, brave and very human characters.There's good casting here and favorite actors from Person of Interest and other TV shows show up (including Stargate!): Brennan Brown, David Hewlett, James Carpinello. The latter plays a submariner -- the movie makes me want to learn more about that aspect of the war. There are plenty of claustrophobic scenes of men in small, cramped places, but the submarine scenes are truly disquieting.And then there's Woody Harrelson. He seems to be everywhere these days. Like always, he's just simply excellent as Nimitz.I love what Emmerich does at the end of the movie, with an homage to the real people who are portrayed.This movie made me think about that old Midnight Oil song -- The Forgotten Years. How phenomenally brave these people were. And how horrible war is. We are the recipients of the peace and prosperity they fought for. It is so easy to forget how dreadful it was.In the end, this is a fine movie that leaves you thinking but (thankfully) not depressed.",,Anonymous,History

"A bad movie, very disappointing","Why? Bad script, bad acting, bad CGI.For me, the movie gets it all wrong right at the beginning when ""Dick Best"" pulls off his totally unbelievable, ridiculous cowboy stunt landing on the carrier, trying to impress his rookie gunner. Ed Skrein has not one single redeeming scene or dialogue thereafter in the whole movie where he might actually resemble a real person. Of course he must contend with the terrible, infantile script he was given but maybe he really is just a bad actor. For me this issue got aggrevated due to his character getting the most screen time of them all.It is also there that it is impossible not to notice right from the start the badly done CGI that pervades the whole movie and reduces it to the visual experience of a video game. Everything is always clean and in excellent repair or condition. The planes always look like they are on their maiden flight, clean and shiny, no specks of leaked oil or traces of exhaust fumes, no dings, no flaws. They still look good and clean even with a lot of holes in them from enemy fire. It is just very ridiculous and easily identified when comparing them to photos of operational combat war planes from the era. They were gruffy, got used and were banged up.The general cleanliness of the movie irked me at other times too. The actors never seem to sweat or look too distressed. Most silly example of that was the scene of Bruno Gaido and his pilot in the life raft after crashing down into the ocean. Despite the stress and agony they must have gone through over the last few minutes, hours or perhaps days, Gaido looks clean, fresh and cheerful like having stepped out of the bathroom right after his morning toilette.The script offers only a few moments of intelligence, credibility and genuity and for the most part reduces the actors to mere caricatures of real people. The scenes involving Adm. Nimitz/Woody Harrelson are quite well-done. This includes his encounter with Rochefort in the ""Dungeon"". It is marred only by the highly improbable even embarrassing speech the script gives the Rochefort actor. Nobody would talk so lacking in respect and factuality to their commanding 4-star Admiral. But then Rochefort actually says some intelligent things too, and the actor Brennan Brown gave a very credible impression.One other noteworthy, good dialogue I found the brief scene at the officers casino where McClusky explains Best's wife the real reason why her husband was not getting promoted because of recklessness and total disregard of his own and, above all, his men's safety. That actually made a lot of sense. And Luke Evans is a serviceable actor.Speaking of the actors, of the main leads only Woody Harrelson and the Japanese officers (Yamamoto, Nagumo and Yamaguchi) I found convincing. Patrick Wilson suffers because he is incapable of any facial expressions or nuances in delivering his part. He reminded me of Kevin Costner in that respect, constantly looking like a beaten dog or having a tummy ache. Ed Skrein ruins his opening scene and it goes downhill from there. Dennis Quaid probably overdid the ""Bull"" aspect of his character a little bit, but was not terrible. Aaron Eckhart is a good actor but had nothing to work with.The whole side story of the Doolittle Raid was I found a bit of a waste to see in this movie. But I can imagine it was in part a bow to the Chinese side of the production, as without the Chinese cooperation none of Doolittle's men would have survived when in fact some 71 of 80 returned while the Chinese paid a high price for their help, as correctly stated in the movie.Overall this movie falls short for me on many levels to be enjoyed. I cited some things but there are many more (eg. Depiction of the actual fighting, confusing editing and plot holes, as well as some historical inaccuracies), while its redeeming qualities I can only find a few, like the good soundtrack and the outro mini-bio's before the end titles.If you want to learn more about the real Midway I can recommend the book ""The Battle of Midway"" by Greg L. Symonds as an excellent read.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Best WW2 movie in decades,"Finally there is a WW2 movie with the right balance of modern effects and good storytelling. I've always preferred the straightforward stories in Tora Tora Tora and A Bridge Too Far over the newer gory angst filled war movies and those which deal with obscure insignificant incidents. Unlike Bay's Pearl Harbor or the older Midway movie there is no wasted time on silly romances. Also the dragginess of Eastwood and the gore of Spielberg are not present here.The screenplay is clear and comprehensive from pre Pearl Harbor to the decisive day everything is clearly explained. Doolittle deserves mention. Good history lesson for some folks nowadays who seem to forget which country was defending themselves against those who waged aggressive wars! Slower moments are not dull as they are used to explain strategy, training and the role of intelligence.The air battle scenes and dive bombing scenes are thrilling yet clear. You can still see who is who. You are really put right into the center of things. Superb exciting cinematography without looking fake or too CGI.The casting is brilliant. Using distinctive famous actors to portray the various heroes helps the viewer remember who is who and build up sympathy for whether they make it or not. Ed Skrein usually the anti hero type role.

Patrick Wilson is perfect as the intelligence officer who helped get it right. The older actors like Denis Quaid and Aaron Eckhart are well cast too and Woody usually a goofball is fine. Actors usually don't associate with historic roles like Darren Criss and Jonas are surprisingly right. Mandy Moore looks pretty and suitable in her WW2 getup. Should do more roles from this period.

Story is good but bad execution,"Really one bad movie. If you don't know the history you will just get confused. Bad dialogues and very bad jumping in years without any connection between them.

Astoundingly bad,"It is impossible to fail more than this film does. It fails on every single level. It is above all, absolutely boring. There is no coherent story, there is nothing of interest, the special effects are so unbelievable than suspension of disbelief, an option usually reserved for science fiction, is not even possible. Indeed, this is an attempt to turn WW-2 into Star Wars, only with unlikable assholes behind the controls instead of righteous rebels. There is no way to list in a short review all the ways in which this film fails, but the most essential one is that is is just filled with the most insufferable pouting, smirking jerks imaginable. You actually root for the Japanese to win. It is not even worth going into all the ways the actual battle was not even touched. Forget history. Forget flying. Forget naval strategy. All that is missing is Darth Vader-San, looming over the Japanese flagship and barking Japanese commands, with portentous music throbbing in the background. The movie would have been more interesting that way, maybe with say a Japanese-American flyer who has some telepathic connection with Admiral Vader-San. Ruke - I am your father!

"Great cinematography and directing, terrible screenplay and editing.","For being the most expensive independent film ever made, it delivered. The cinematography and directing by Roland Emmerich were on point, but although the film had mainly decent pacing, the 138 min runtime felt much longer. Terrible choppy editing made matters worse. I get this is amateur writer Wes Tooke's first full length feature film, but when this indie film cost $100 million, why wouldn't the producers at least have a seasoned screenwriter look over the flawed script. Casting was however great as was the score and production sets. Sure the CGI/S/V/fx could've been better, but for an indie film, they were adequate. It's a 7/10 from me",7.0,Anonymous,History

"Good movie, the pivotal battle of Midway, six months after the attack on Pearl Harbor.","My wife and I watched this at home on BluRay from our public library. Then a few weeks later I watched it again, it was a worthwhile second viewing. With the COVID-19 sweeping the USA now it is a good time to stay away from real crowds!I wonder how many travelers to Chicago know that Midway airport was named in remembrance of the Battle of Midway? The island, called Midway Atoll now, is about halfway between Japan and California, roughly 1000 miles NW of Hawaii. In June 1942, just six months after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, the Battle of Midway set the course for the rest of the war with Japan.The key to getting the upper hand were code breakers, some were musicians in civilian life before the war, they were able to figure out when and where the next attack would be. So even though the US forces were outnumbered, and many planes and pilots were lost, they managed to sink the Japanese carriers and cripple their operations. Japan never recovered.The movie is very accurate, some viewers may complain about the special effects but those are secondary to the story which recounts what happened. The disc has extras, including interviews with two remaining survivors of the Battle of Midway.Good movie of an important battle in the 1940s war with Japan.",,Anonymous,History
Midway Barrel Rolls Away from Being Good or Bad and Flies Straight Down the Middle,"I've taken my share of WW2 history but I never had to study the battle of Midway. So I walked into this fairly fresh and one of the more pleasant surprises was the more balanced look this movie presented. There's no confusing which side the movie is on but humanizing the antagonists always helps the drama sink in a little deeper and it helps sell how devastating this period of WW2 was. The actors playing the Japanese command (e.g. Etsushi Toyokawa and Tadanobu Asano) are given a lot of material to chew on and they succeed in getting you to at least look at their side of things. You still get the elements of cheering on the Americans (which is what most of the movie going public wants to see) but a bigger picture point of view is a unique element for Midway.Midway boasts a surprisingly large cast, its not full of a lot of A-list actors, but you've seen all these people working in mid-large budget releases or in some well reviewed TV dramas. Leading the cast is charming but unfortunately miscast Ed Skrein. He's normally playing a villain and I was intrigued to see him go a different direction. He's working hard here but he doesn't seem to fit what this movie is going for. It doesn't help that his accent is pretty rough, hopefully he'll bounce back. Woody Harrelson is the type of performer who can elevate substandard material but he's not putting much into his interpretation of Nimitz. Nick Jonas is fine as Bruno, he's a better actor than I thought he would be but considering his background in music, he's hard to buy as a tough guy type. Much like Harrelson, there's a lot of workmanlike effort put in here (Luke Evans, Mandy Moore, Aaron Eckhart come to mind). That doesn't make the acting bad, they're all performers that are easy to like, the acting just isn't something to write home about in Midway. I'd credit Patrick Wilson and Dennis Quaid for being the most effective (even if Quaid just growls through 90% of his scenes, at least he's good at it?).Emmerich has a more varied career as a director than you would think, but his main claim to fame is his big budget disaster flicks. You don't get those opportunities without knowing how to use special effects to deliver the goods on some action scenes (the overall quality of the movies... that's a different story). The movie didn't start well, I found the attack on Pearl Harbour to be underwhelming when it came to the action but there was plenty of movie still left to go. The scenes with Skrein's character in a dogfight or manoeuvring to dive bomb enemy ships were pretty intense and they really play up the chaotic nature of the battle. Everything is covered in smoke, shrapnel, or fire and it serves as another reminder that war is h#!! The movie delivered the thrills more regularly as it went on and by the end, I got what I wanted out of Midway.Midway falls into a category of movie that's tough to write about. Its hard to make pointed arguments or have poignant opinions about a mediocre movie. The really good ones and the really bad ones are the easiest to write about, its the movies that leave you shrugging your shoulders when you leave the theatre that really stall your creative impulses. This is a tough genre to stand out in too, there's so many great war movies, you really have bring something shocking or affecting to the table to grab the public's attention. Emmerich's ability to work with CGI and experience shooting big set pieces keep this movie afloat. Providing more context by showing the situation from both sides is also a nice bonus to Midway. But conversely there's the cliche dialogue, the middle of the road acting and the long running time dragging it down. I'm not shocked that Midway has surprised in theatres but I could have waited for Netflix and had a similar experience viewing it. The big action scenes are cool but nothing screamed ""I had to see this in a theatre!"" If I hadn't seen this with a good friend, I would have called it a disappointment. Its hard to recommend Midway with being over 2.25 hours long but I wouldn't stop you from checking it out. I'd avoid paying full price and just catch it on your preferred streaming service.",6.0,Anonymous,History
At least Roland Emmerich and his copycat Mike Bay have a scene in common,"This scene is Pearl Harbor attack, which was the main point of the film from 2001. But over the years, I have always confounded Michael Bay and Roland Emmerich. If you compare their filmographies, I guess you'll be in the very same analysis as I am. This film is OK, a pretty good time waster, over fed with CGI of course; I don't know if any real planes were ever used. But that's our period that imposes this. More budget, maybe, but things can be shown which could not have been without the CGI.

Central Intelligence Leads To Accurate Though Choppy War Movie,"War is hell a wise person once said, and in many ways we the general public have no idea what it was like on those battlegrounds where so many sacrificed so much. Fortunately for many of us, the movies have offered a glimpse into the world, opening our eyes to the world that cares little of its soldiers in regards to decency and humane treatment. Many of these films are often about the action, and while not as prominent as they once were back in the day, they still offer some intense views of history. Past this introduction, this weekend, yet another historical remake is flying in to make a landing, in hopes of wowing the group once more with its depiction of the great war. Robbie K here with yet another review as we look into:Movie: Midway (2019)LIKES:The Modern Technology Prowess
Multiple Aspect providing different viewpoints
The Intensity Of Some War Scenes
The Decent Acting
The Intelligence AspectDISLIKES:Disjointed Plot
Too many Perspectives
The Semi Forced Love Story
The Choppiness of the scenes
Semi-sloppy use of big names
The Action ScenesSUMMARY:Modern technology allows us to make things more realistic and engaging, and should in theory lead to better fights. In a way Midway accomplishes this by bringing the chaos with speaker booming effects, special effects that light up the screen, and dances with planes that once relied on plywood models. It is certainly the selling points of the trailers and should appeal to the modern audiences expectations as realism and style come together. This film though took a different approach compared to the previous theaters of war, not focusing so much on the action from America by itself, but instead dividing the focus between both parties involved. This dynamic is impressive to see because it helps show the strategy involved in something you have only read about in a history textbook, allowing for a different appreciation of the tactics in war. In fact, my favorite aspect, as well as my good buddy, both agreed that seeing the intelligence component involved with determining how to fight the Pacific campaign. Much of the film is dedicated to showing how codes were cracked, departments coordinated, and risks were taken to determine the best places to strike and this new perspective was very strongly placed. When the battles did finally occur, there are several moments where you get pulled into the intensity, feeling like you are part of the squad and in the cockpit during this operation. Nice editing on these parts, and quite an adrenaline rush at the times it works. Finally, the acting is not an issues in this film, as all personalities of war are brought in and everyone executes there roles quite well when they are on stage. I'm not saying Academy Award Level, but it's believable and appropriate for this film's approach.For all its worth though, there are several limitations for this reviewer that make the film a little less impressive compared to its predecessors. For one thing, the film feels disjointed, as our time hops and evolution of war occur a little too frequently to necessarily keep track of everything. All the pesrpectives, while again interesting, also have too much going on, leading to breaking up a lot of scenes just as they start cooking with gas. The result is a rather contained movie that struggles to find the approach it wants, with choppy scenes that sort of scatter the coordination rather than unite it. This is especially true for the romance story they try to put in here, which was unnecessary giving the presentation and could have been left out. Throw in several attempts at character development, the potential bonds that can form between a number of characters, and even the squad mates themselves and you again get sort of piece meal presentations that did not achieve what Pearl Harbor did long ago. Once more, this reviewer feels part of this is due to how many big names they have, trying to get the most out of the big price tags that come with them. Midway's crew acts just fine, but there were so many missed elements and character interactions that I feel many of these people were unnecessary. Certainly they were able to point out all the contributions they did, but to deny the full fledged chemistry and quality, well that was the disappointment for me. Finally, the action scenes. An action junky like me always crave for cohesive battle scenes that utilize their groups well, something that the early war movies, and even some films like Saving Private Ryan knew how to do. In this one, all the perspectives and heroes were scattered that the action scenes felt again very sloppy and short, chopped up moments that ended too fast or how long it took to start. Again realistically it accomplishes the portrayal, but at this point and with what the trailers built up... I wanted more out of a modern day, technological behemoth like this one looked to be.The VERDICT:Let's wrap it up then shall we? Midway accomplishes the idea of putting modern faces in traditional stories, and this theater of wars proves that trying new things does not always come together for this reviewer. Sure, the technological advantages are good and all the actors recruited do their parts to bring the group of heroes to life and retell the legacies of men who faced the demons of war. I'll also again give them props for focusing a lot on the strategy and intelligence required to pull off the miracle that we did. However, all of these perspectives and approaches to the story made for what looked like a difficulty to focus on the story they wanted to tell. The result is again a disjointed movie that struggles to bring A games to any perspective, and relies on B and C graded stories. Your truly would have loved a little more action to come together, as the trailers promised, but at least the intelligence parts work together to make for an engaging plot. For special effects it qualifies for a theater visit, but outside of that, hold this one for home viewing instead.My scores are:Drama/War/History/Action: 6.5

Hard to describe how bad this was,"I guess Dennis Quaid, seeing his future as just an esurrance spokesman wanted to go out and prove he could be part of a movie worse than Jaws 3. I went in with expectations so low, I figured I'd have to be pleasantly surprised, but with acting worse than Daytime Soaps, ludicrous action scenes, and annoying a-hole characters, I was actually happy when the Japanese killed them, which I didn't think could ever be possible. This movie is a cliff note version of early WWII naval action made for video gamers with Attention Deficit Disorder with too many faults to mention. Terrible movie from the opening flight scene to the last cornball line. The only reason I didn't walk out of my empty theater, is that I wanted to see if the next scene could possibly be worse, and here, the director didn't fail.

Straightforward WW 2 history,"Midway works fine for what it is --- a direct account of events leading up to and including the famous sea and air battle. It is much like ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" in its approach, and is far superior to ""Pearl Harbor."" Both the Americans and the Japanese are depicted respectfully, while not ignoring Japanese atrocities. It's a good balance, and accurate.For my taste, the heavy reliance on CGI had weak moments (especially the Pearl Harbor"" sequence), but the action surrounding the battle of Midway itself is done quite well. My wife was leaning forward in her seat, fully engaged in the life or death struggle. One cannot help but come away with enormous respect for the young flyers who faced almost certain death to cripple the Japanese navy at a dire moment.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A typical Emmerich affair makes Midway watchable but forgettable,"Subtle filmmaking is not something you expect from the man behind Godzilla, Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow and in the spirit of keeping true to form, director Roland Emmerich ensures Midway is best when its spectacle is taking centre stage as it attempts to shine a spotlight on the famed WW2 battle.Already the subject of many a feature film and documentary, the battle that shaped the outcome of the great war is loaded with plotlines, battles within battles and more real life hero's than an Avengers film and Emmerich at times struggles with the nuances that are required when you're telling such a convoluted and incendiary tale but with his heart in the right place and with a constantly moving pace, Midway is a perfectly watchable effort that may not hold up to scrutiny but provides great entertainment value as it's occurring before our eyes.Filled with one of the most recognisable low A to B-grade group of actors that one could hope to assemble in today's climate, with the rent a bad boy Ed Skrein leading the charge around the likes of Patrick Wilson, Woody Harrelson, Luke Evans and the should've stayed at home token female Mandy Moore, Midway does feel like one of those awkwardly budgeted Hollywood event films that co-collaboration with Chinese film investors has seen it gather up $70-$80 million of funds to produce some slightly above game-like graphics in its set pieces but thanks to the true story as its foundation, it's hard to ever hate or be disinterested in proceedings even if Wes Tooke's cheese laden script work attempts to derail things whenever the aerial battles are not front and centre.Lucky for the film, Emmerich's action flair often gets Midway up and about as we follow Skrein and his fellow pilots across a selection of daring battles in the Pacific and while we don't often care too much for the cardboard cut-out characters that Tooke and Emmerich have brought to life, we understand the heroism and daring of these men that risked their lives in often horribly outnumbered underdog battles.As a piece of big screen spectacle, the sky-bound action and thrilling sea battles that form a large portion of Midway's runtime make sure that you feel as though you're getting your monies worth with the simplistic storytelling and more old-fashioned approach to the story by Emmerich likely to please those that found the likes of Dunkirk and 1917 to technically focused to be fist-pumping inspiring.It's a shame however that Midway didn't attempt to fine tune its quieter moments to build more emotional investment in its array of participants and figures as had it refined it storytelling and approached its material in a more considered manner, it's likely this watchable but forgettable examination of history defining moments would've been the hit it so easily could've been.Final Say -A typical Emmerich like affair, Midway is sure to please those seeking a surface deep look at the renowned WW2 battle that includes some thrilling action moments but Midway's lack strong emotion or character building holds back its chances of being something genuinely special.3 heroic deck-hands out of 5",6.0,Anonymous,History
Midway to sky,"Despite numerous historical and cinematic inaccuracies, as well as military ones, the film's cinematography is spectacular and undoubtedly leaves the viewer anything but indifferent. And when something is spectacular, it's normal to find divided opinions. On one side, there are those who consider the massive use of CGI as inappropriate, and on the other, those who are captivated by the typical American war narrative, filled with heroes, memorable lines, and plenty of action.As always, reality lies somewhere in between, and this film unquestionably delivers what the general audience, not the one specialized in war movies, tends to demand from a cinematic production: action, entertainment, superhuman characters, and lots of gunfire. And, of course, this production cannot be any less than other similar productions, knowing who is in charge already gives us a clue about the direction it will take.It's true that the film is filled with genre stereotypes, but it's clear that there's an effort to balance these stereotypes with the occasional nod to the audience so that the scales don't tip too far toward the obvious.What more can be said? Narratively, it becomes a bit complicated to follow the thread of events, but it's actually appreciable to see the effort put into portraying events that are often difficult to encompass in a single film. The director's pursuit of cinematic tension takes precedence over a more didactic narrative of the facts.Furthermore, everything is very well constructed, the characters are highly believable, the visual aspect is quite captivating. In conclusion, it's an excellent production that keeps pace with the times we live in.",9.0,Anonymous,History

"Mumble ""havoc,"" and let slip the cliches of war!","Is it possible that some stories from World War II simply can't be told well? Roland Emmerich's big ol' bucket of war movie clichés and eight gajillion dollars in computer graphics gets the essential story of the Battle of Midway correct (rookies fight professionals; rookies win), but I don't know where to begin with the bizarre pacing of the story-telling, the big and small inaccuracies, the clichés, the stern jaws, the ridiculous clumping up of ships instead of spacing them out, the wrong emblems on American planes, the missing planes, the planes that hadn't been built yet, the missing parts of the story, the dopiness here, the cartoon-characters there, and, quite literally, some of the worst dialogue ever uttered by people in flight gear with cigarettes dangling from their lips.And yet, as with the gawdawful 1976 version, if you have absolutely no clue about any of this, you'll be alright. I can't stay mad at this stupid movie because it provides a service, and it is an oddity. The lunkheads in the theater who came to see a war movie got to ooh and ahh at the exploding this and the machine-gunned that. There's no Naval aviator in love with a cute Japanese girl who's about to be shipped off to an internment camp in Yeast Infection, Idaho, and danged if the whole thing is pretty straightforward in its simple patriotism.The idea that Hollywoke would produce such a film is almost absurdly unbelievable. On top of that, the women in this movie are loyal, loving wives of their warrior husbands. Then, to sweeten the deal further, there are none of the following:Overtly gay people, women presidents, anti-gun activists, angry black people shouting ""I can't breathe,"" angry white Antifa protesters burning down businesses owned by black people in order to fight fascism, wise-beyond-their-years high school students holding placards, superheroes with millennial-tragic backstories, or any other stereotypical group that simply doesn't belong in a war movie set in 1942.There was no wisecracking black sailor oozing fatalistic wisdom, as in U-571.There were white people and Asian people trying to kill each other. Kinda what you would expect in . . .1942.So, where do I stand on this stupid blob of bad story-telling? Well, as with the other movie, I think a movie that gets a doofus here and a potted plant there to be interested in our history, no matter how bad, is a good thing. Yet, as I said almost twenty years ago when I reviewed the previous film, my first recommendation is to read ""Incredible Victory"" by Walter Lord. Throw in ""The Eagles Claw"" by Jeff Shaara, and you're on your way to understanding Midway.One last thing. The Americans were not that terribly outnumbered. They had almost the same number of ships as the Japanese, they were fighting on their own turf (with a high state of piss-off thrown in), and they had been reading the Japanese' mail. On the other hand, the expertise from years of experience gave the Japanese a decided advantage.And one more last thing: Where were the F4F Wildcat fighters flown by Enterprise, Yorktown, and Hornet?Should I go on? Your silence says no.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Nice war movie,"The movie goes trough the Battle of Midway and the events leading to it. Given that this isn't a documentary it does a pretty nice job in taking everything into account. There is almost always something historically inaccurate in these type of movies, but this one got the events right and there wasn't any blatantly obvious mistakes The story is well paced, the viewers attention is constantly held. Thankfully they didn't messed it up with an unnecessary love story. The CGI is good but man it is inconsistent. In some scenes you barely realize the CGI (usually when it is in the background). There are places where it is obvious like most of the big wide shots showing the battles and scenery, but it isn't disturbing. And there are the scenes that look outright fake! Usually when the actors had to be in a full CGI scene. Visuals look like they were coming from a video game, especially on scenes where the actors had to stand in a CGI set. The greenscreen is sooo obvious. It really breaks immersion. It definitely worth a watch but it doesn't show anything extraordinary.",7.0,Anonymous,History

"Wow, a comic book action about war","Roland Emmerich, ladies and gentlemen.I knew what to expect from him but still am quite impressed. I mean, he only does relatively big budget huge in scale nonsense films with little to no story split between 20-25 characters (and re-using them, I felt sad this film had no smug and sleazy supposedly Jewish lawyer stereotype).And this film is no different except for one important thing - real people are being portrayed.The film has two major issues. The first one is expected - the story is a mess and the pacing is all over the place. The film jumps around places and characters, half of which get nearly not enough screen time to make them memorable. All the dialogue is either cliche heroism motivation speeches or 100% unrefined exposition, when a character says literally the key note you have to be getting out of that scene, since it's so bad its incomprehensible without an explanation. It just follows the pattern - action scene->nonsensical dialogue->exposition. After a couple of iterations the film ends and we are told some backstory about the real people that were shown in the film, and it just makes you wonder how good would it be if they had actual real characters with emotions and motivations besides ""that one guy we didn't know anything about who died in the first 5 minutes made him really angry"". They could've written this in a way to provide great service to the real people portrayed in this, who did their best and acted selflessly, but they didn't bother. So all of our ""characters"" are mostly cardboard cut-outs who are more shallow than modern comic book superheroes. It was nice to see real pictures in the end, but please, have some respect. I would never care if an overblown action film had badly written characters but these are real people.The second issue is the look of the film. The lighting and the color correction is probably intentional and is done to reference some sort of style (and the poster too). So it feels like they wanted it to look this way. But the horrible green screens and composite shots really hurt this film. Roland Emmerich actually made me feel like I'm watching a Star Wars prequel, you know, with full CGI backdrops that never look realistic or believable. Some of the CGI shots also felt like a modern video-game cutscene. It looked too bright, too polished and new for a war film. I mean yeah, Dunkirk also looked stylized, but Nolan was actually able to present three different timeFLOWS, not even timelines. So don't get me started on this one (and the budgets are comparable). I haven't seen this in a theater but my home setup is sufficient to enjoy a good picture with surround sound, and I mostly laughed at the dialogue or felt bored during CGI battles.P.S. I also want to commend most of the actors for giving a good performance even given the bad script, except for Ed Skrein, he was clearly cast only for the looks and he felt confused on what he is trying to deliver throughout the film.
P.P.S. Also, the way the Japanese are portrayed at first comes as a bit of a surprise, but when you check the production companies and the markets this film was aimed for (mostly Chinese audiences) it all makes sense. I mean, I'm not going to talk about propaganda and conspiracy theories, but a thinking person will understand what I mean with a single viewing.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Lacks heart,"MIDWAY: A history lesson for those who don't know. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, December 7, 1941, brought the US into WWII. It's very apparent that the budget for this film was huge. But it wasn't spent on the biggest A-list cast, but rather on the battle sequences. Too bad they spent so much for so little: Ships and planes shooting at each other with the occasional torpedo launch; planes going down; battleships and aircraft carriers exploding; grimacing pilots trying to evade shells while still trying to remain on target; planes and pilots getting hit; bombs dropping. Except for the epilogue which summarized the lives of some of the major figures involved, this one doesn't touch us. The acting across the board is serviceable (no pun intended). The wives of the pilots are clones of each other. Something is missing from the depiction of the events, even though it's told from the perspective of the individuals involved on both sides. The direction is much more concerned with the action while slighting character and humanity and the sheer heroism of the pilots who flew those missions and the crews who supported them. We're not given the chance to connect with the characters. It's factual. The movie tells the story, but we're not involved, we're not moved, because the telling lacks heart. It's cold. Score: 6. Not worth it. The heroism is deserving of our upmost respect and honor. 12/16/19",6.0,Anonymous,History

Just as much as I despised Pearl Harbour, as a ridiculous movie that mixed unwisely a pathetic love-triangle, bad acting and worse CGI, I appreciated the focus of this movie being on the military actions and a bunch of believable and likeable characters.It's like nowadays the audience who appreciates an heroic war story with positive characters is just too ""uncool"" or something and one must criticise the ""telling it straight"".

Fast and Furious: Midway Edition,"I was not expecting much from ""Midway"". As soon as I watched the trailer I already knew that this was going to be a bad movie, but I decided to give it a shot anyway.Technically, the movie is awful on every aspect: impossible explosions, unrealistic airplanes monoeuvres and incredibly bad action in general. Some green screen scenes are terrible. From an Hollywood movie you are expecting more, considering the budget. After 20 years Pearl Harbour has better effects and cinematography and still today remains one of the best and solid movie about that period. This movie reminded me the Fast and Furious saga, that I always avoid.Cast was good and overall the acting part is solid. No surprises here, there were a lot of well known actors, so at least characters are credible and entertaining. If you exclude fights battle (that are the 80% of the movie), the remaining 20% is well conceived: the movie is extremely balanced as shows the perspective of both americans and japanes, deepening some aspects that other movies such as Pearl Harbour or the original 1976 Midway, did not take in consideration, because too political and on the side of Uncle Sam.I was not expecting a masterpiece, but neither this garbage.

Beautiful mayhem.,"The Hurt Locker, Platoon, Saving Private Ryan, Full Metal Jacket: quality war films that exceed Midway in story-telling originality but not in astonishing graphics and fidelity to the facts.If you had a hunch that Midway is another Roland Emmerich eye-porn spectacle that defined that genre along with Michael Bay (whose Pearl Harbor could have learned a lesson or two from Emmerich), you are right. Midway takes a well-known and revered battle in WWII and milks as much cliché and melodrama as possible.Yet there is a wholesome honesty about this spectacle, a desire to tell it like it was that makes you feel you are witnessing the countless small decisions by admirals and pilots to bring the formidable Japanese to their knees. Pilots falling from the sky and Japanese carriers sinking to the bottom with their heroic admirals all seem real and heart-rending. Emmerich and writer Wes Tooke depict the deal deciders with their hubris and humanity in sharp detail.Midway will not be on the Oscar finalist list, for it is too formulaic a war film and deficient in deep character development, but what it has is a firm grasp of the historical details and a dedication to showing the difficult decisions that rely partly on gut and valor. Moreover, the CGI battle scenes are remarkably realistic.If you have a great grandpa who rode a dive bomber at a Japanese warship and refuses to talk about the experience, then see Midway to get the authentic feeling of being in battle. And besides, the CGI and overall visuals are what Americans get right, despite Japanese brilliance in animation and cinema in general.

Best Dolby Atmos mix of 2020 so far.,"Midway (4K Blu-ray)Forget the insanely cheesy dialogue and the lashings of schmaltz.
'Midway' is best enjoyed with the brain turned down and your home theatre system turned up way past eleven.
On 4K Blu-ray this film boasts one of the best sound mixes ever to grace home media.
The film tells the story of the battle of Midway.
An important turning point in World War II.
With a stellar cast, Roland Emmerich's film has all the right ingredients to be a blockbuster.
Sadly the cliche script, and hammy acting do this movie no favours.
In terms of cinematic quality think less 'Saving Private Ryan' and more 'Pearl Harbour '.
That said this film is still huge fun and it can't be helped but to get caught up in all the spectacle.Bringing me on to this movies biggest selling point.
On 4K Blu-ray this movie is a must have for the Home Cinema enthusiasts.
Picture quality is good but not demo worthy.
There's a layer of grain added in post production which elevates the cinematic appearance.
The colour palette is vintage helping give the movie a Saturday afternoon matinee feel.
HDR helps generate some blindingly bright explosions and adds a three dimensional look to the aerial battles.
'Midway' doesn't boast a 4K crisp image throughout but for the most part it is a fine transfer.
Sound quality on the other hand is a different story.
This is one bass heavy mix.
The Dolby Atmos track that accompanies this movie is an absolute belter.
Height and surround effects are constant with the battle scenes being demo worthy.
If you're sat on the fence about buying a dedicated Home theatre system. This movie will sway you.
Your neighbours might not be too happy if you crank this movie up to the max.
You may even crack the plaster on your ceiling.
'Midway' has a 10/10 sound mix and will be your new go to disc to showcase your system.Overall the movie maybe a little cheesy but as a surround sound experience this movie is the best offering so far in 2020.",7.0,Anonymous,History

I've watched the 1976 version which is okay, albeit loaded with stars which was distracting. There is also a good documentary on youtube that gives you the cold facts of what happened at Midway because it was both American efforts and thinking and Japanese mistakes that rendered the final result. This one gives you a bit of context and a real sense of the frantic scramble of events and of course, the realization that a lot of guys climbed into planes knowing they weren't coming back. .The film moves along crisply, the story is clear and I enjoyed it. I stumbled across it on one of the pay per view channels as it was starting and deciding to watch it. I didn't know much about it, other than to remember that it had lukewarm reviews when it was released. I didn't know that Roland Emmerich had directed it, and I'll admit, I'm a fan of his movies, however nonsensical they often are.Here's what Mr. Emmerich does well and what works in this movie. He is very good at presenting regular people in outrageous situations and then showing them dealing with it. This time it's not aliens or weather or some weird ring, its a sneak attack. The Americans had been sucker punched by a formidable adversary, were on their back foot and Midway was where that changed and they started taking the fight to Japan.

Mistaken appraisals of great director and movie,"Roland Emmerich is one of the great contemporary directors. Perhaps his most salient characteristic is the creation of amazingly bombastic imagery in telling stories of gripping action (Stargate, Independence Day, Godzilla, The Day After Tomorrow, 2012). He has also repeatedly treated supernatural and science fiction themes with his powerful expressive imagery.In ""Midway"", he treats the story of the greatest naval battle of the Second World War with quite strict historic accuracy (for a non-documentary account), complete with bombastic imagery and gripping action. As in his fictional movies, the characters have sufficient depth and the storyline is sufficiently meaningful and consistent in order to engage the spectator entirely.I am astonished at the relatively low rating of this movie, indeed of all of Emmerich's movies on IMDB. Opinions seem to be starkly divided between two camps: those who rave and give high scores, and those who disparage and give low scores. Many criticisms of the latter group seem to relate to what they say is missing from the movie, or what the movie failed to do. But I think that a movie should be taken for what it is, not what it is not. Every movie would ultimately fail by that account. There is no point in criticizing Hitchcock for lacking in comic relief, or Billy Wilder for being too frivolous.It is very difficult to say what makes a good movie. In my view, the ultimate test is whether a movie makes a memorable impression on the viewer. By that measure, even an awful movie can actually be a good movie, because it succeeded in communicating something lasting to the viewer. In my view, therefore, ""Midway"" is a good movie, even a very good movie, considering all its clear qualities in script, dialogue, framing, acting, cinematography and music. There is just no way this movie can be truthfully given a low rating.This is my rating system: mediocre is 1-3, moderate is 4-6, and good is 7-9. In each range a movie is then either lower, middling or upper in that range. Unsurpassable is 10. I would have given ""Midway"" an 8. But because of the unjustifiable low ratings, I am giving a 9 to compensate. Roland Emmerich remains one of the great contemporary directors, as attested by his powerful style.By the way, about the battle of Midway: I encourage those who are interested in watching a three-part documentary on youtube (v=Bd8_vO5zrjo) which recounts the battle from the Japanese perspective. It adds a lot to the historic background by explaining the dilemma that faced Admiral Nagumo and how his huge mistake caused their defeat, but also gives a sobering account of the heroic losses taken by the American pilots.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Solid war epic,"This is a highly entertaining war film that is for the most part historically accurate. Upon further research into the history of Midway i see that several liberties were taken with some of what really happened during the battle to give it a Hollywood touch. The CGI was a bit much at times and i have seen better flying sequences in much older movies but is tolerable by some fantastic acting, the veterans the likes of Woody Harrelson & Dennis Quaid really shine in their roles. The PG13 rating is a bit puzzling the film seemed to be a tad too wholesome for being historical war material. I do appreciate how the film tends to focus more on the men's responsibility and heroism but i found that further characterization fell by the wayside. All in all Midway succeeded with a very entertaining time albeit a bit over the top at times but with enough historical accuracies that make this a solid film.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Incredibly boring and confusing,"This movie tries so much that it fails at pretty much everything. Storytelling is very confusing, jumping from one place to other, one even to other. There is no character development. You don't get a chance to attach to any of the characters, so in the end you find yourself realizing you couldn't care less what happens to any of them. Graphics are ugly. You get a more realistic picture playing PS4. The dialog is so bad, it destroys your brain.
It is a typical, over the top US-patriotic movie filled with American pride and with the only aim to showcase American heroism and sacrifice. Sadly, you don't care about any of it since the movie is sooooo bad.

The 1976 movie is better in most respects,"I will try to watch this movie again, and maybe I'll have a better experience the 2nd time, but there are obvious problems with this movie, including the casting. In the 1976 movie Admiral Nimitz was played by Henry Fonda. In this movie Admiral Nimitz is played by Woody. Since when has Woody ever been a serious actor, known for playing serious roles in serious movies? Why stop with Woody, why not cast Bill Murray to play Admiral Nimitz?As with most great battles throughout history, a proper telling of the story needs to reveal the key decisions by the leaders, the turning points in the battle, the extent of good vs. bad outcome of the various decisions, and the extent to which dumb luck and mother nature had a hand in determining the outcome. We, the audience, want to be educated by a movie of this type, not entertained per se. This movie seems unable to make up its mind what it wants to accomplish. The extensive use of CGI does very little to enhance the telling of what happened in the battle of Midway. I'm not suggesting that this movie should have been a documentary of the kind you see on the history channel. Although many of the documentaries on the History channel are easier to sit through than this was. The IMDB viewer ratings are essentially the same for this movie vs. the 1976 movie, but this is a reflection of the fact that the modern audience was mostly born after 1990 and doesn't want to watch any movie that isn't filled with special effects. The producers of this movie could have made a better movie than the 1976 movie, through judicious use of more modern technology. This clearly is not what they set out to do, as evidenced for one example by the choice of Woody to play Admiral Nimitz. Some of the other actors in the 1976 movie: Charlton Heston, Glenn Ford, James Coburn, Hal Holbrook, Robert Mitchum, Cliff Robertson, Robert Wagner. Around half of the actors playing the major roles in this 2019 movie are pop music starts with no experience playing serious roles and not having the right stuff for the audience to take them seriously as military leaders. Another decade from now this movie will be largely forgotten, and the 1976 movie will continue to be televised on Memorial Day and on the Fourth of July. And don't get me wrong about Woody. I'm a fan of Woody. Just not when cast as Admiral Nimitz in a movie about the battle of Midway.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Action Packed,"A lot of people didn't really like this movie for many different reasons. I will day for the most part I agree with them. I think the historical accuracy, from what I've heard, is spot on. Many people think that because there are so many different characters with different stories in this movie it's hard to keep track of everything that is going on. But I think that all of these characters are necessary for the movie because every single character had an impact on the battle and history. The acting was okay, a lot of the cast is super young, Patrick Wilson and Woody Harrelson both did a great job, outside from that it wasn't incredible. It's also a little cheesy which is what you get sometimes from these sorts of movies. But it was an entertaining movie and a deeper look into WWII and how America got involved that is full of action packed scenes.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Very good historical movie,This movie did a great job of covering this battle from a historical perspective. The original Midway movie was a work of fiction with a ridiculous amount of time wasted on the fake characters Matt Garth and his son with the phony Japanese girlfriend.

expected better...,"While sitting in the theatre, I was sure most men wanted to be them, and most women wanted to do them. Hell, when I watched Dick Best dive bomb a Japanese destroyer and then turn back and go at them one more time as if he was returning a few rounds of blazing hot lead he borrowed last week, I briefly considered giving my wife a hall-pass for him that night; only him, though.That, though, is the problem I have with Roland Emmerich's Midway, the mercurial, big-screen action director, whose new film is much more Independence Day than Saving Private Ryan. These CGI special effects are great to look at, gorgeous even, but cartoonish because so much of it is computer-generated. You never have the feeling that if you reach out, you could touch a live-action plane; this is Star Wars, but now instead of Star Fighters and Y-Wings they are Aichi D34 Carrier-Borne Bombers, Douglas SDB-3 Dauntless Dive Bombers, and Douglas TBD Devastators; the carriers and destroyers are Star Cruisers and Death Stars. The film though, you are talking about a film which is so heavily invested in flight and vintage aircraft that it does an admirable job. The team here does build up a certain amount of suspense and thrills; mainly, the dive-bombing scenes gave me a sense of awe-struck pride and amazement. It's almost the equivalent of a child playing with a toy plane, and making bomb noises with their mouths as they send the plane towards the mother's carpeted family room floor (not the living room floor, that's the room always marked off for ""company""). The film's scripted dialogue is recycled from war films of its own ilk multiple decades before, even though I was slightly relieved when they did acknowledge sacrifices on the other side of unseen events by civilians.",,Anonymous,History

Nice Historical Accuracy,"The Pacific Theater of World War Two has always been of great interest for me. Overall, this movie was quite accurate. Unlike Midway (1976) this one did not create fictional character and story lines, like Charlton Heston's Captain Matt Garth and the whole story line about his son loving a Japanese-American woman. In this movie, all of the principle characters were based on real people. This movie included the first cinematic portrayal of Bruno Gaido (Nick Jonas) that I'm aware of.I think the movie could have better if it would have only focused on the Battle of Midway rather than try to cram the Pearl Harbor attack and Doolittle's Raid into the film. Both events could, and have been, their own movie. The Doolittle Raid part of this movie was poorly done and unnecessary, and seemed more like filler than anything else.As mentioned in several reviews, the CGI effects were really bad. The did indeed look like a video game. Tora! Tora! Tora! (1970) had more convincing visual effects.Ed Skrein's performance as protagonist LT Dick Best (another historical character) was grating and unlikable, but who knows? Perhaps the real Dick Best was grating and unlikable.Woody Harrelson's Admiral Chester Nimitz was passable, as was Dennis Quaid's Admiral William ""Bull"" Halsey.Overall, I enjoyed this movie, and recommend it to anyone who is interested in the Pacific Theater. It gets points from me because it didn't foul up an interesting historical event by injecting fictional story lines like Midway (1976), Pearl Harbor (2001) and Titanic (1997.)",7.0,Anonymous,History

That is my main criticism.The acting was spirited, but the only ones I thought that actually did a good job were Patrick Willson and Woody Harrelson. The others seemed like they were just trying too hard and it came out awkward. Perhaps it was the UK men doing New York and Jersey accents that I could not quite take seriously.I did like the movie as a whole, and appreciated at how accurate the depicted events and characters were. It did soften the blow of it not being an amazing war movie after seeing the trailer and knowing it was a Roland Emmerich film going in. Emmerich's track record hasn't exactly been stellar since after 'The Patriot' in my opinion.This was my chosen Remembrance/Veterans Day movie this year and it served its purpose.

The Biggest Heroes Left Out or Diminished by Layton's and McClusky's Over-Sized Roles,"NONE of the other reviews make the 3 complaints that I will now make: first, THE NUMBER ONE ""INDISPENSABLE MAN,"" JOSEPH ROCHEFORT, was NOT made a lead character. The amount of screen time and actor billing of Edwin Layton's character and Rochefort's should have been reversed. LAYTON WAS NOT A CODEBREAKER - he was just Nimitz's ""Intelligence Officer"" - meaning Layton's main job was to get and discuss Rochefort's daily intelligence report by secure private phone (including how to get around the disagreements of Rochefort's inept Washington bosses) then explain it to Nimitz for analysis and strategy. (Layton was also NOT Rochefort's boss or the boss of his team, as Layton's dialog implies.)In 1925 Naval Reserve Officer Rochefort was recruited to join the Office of Naval Communications' new ""Research Desk,"" an innocuous name for a highly secret unit who's mission in 1925 was changed by its founder Lawrence Stafford from code EN-cryption to code DE-cryption. Safford received the first-ever training in cryptanalysis by the civilian genius Agnes Meyer Driscoll, who majored in maths and minored in foreign languages, music, and physics at Ohio State University. Known as the first great American code-cracker and puzzle-solver, she then tutored Rochefort, who already displayed great talent and enthusiasm in solving puzzles. Rochefort and Safford then hit it off immediately, sharing a zest for the fine points of cryptanalysis, and taking pleasure in the game itself - the satisfaction of solving a puzzle. They continuously improved their cryptanalysis skills by each devising code encryptions, ciphers, and puzzles for the other to solve. When the Navy rotated Safford to sea, Rochefort took over the ""Research Desk,"" training the next generation of cryptananalyists.Rochefort also trained himself in a new field spawned by advances in radio power and technology: Radio Signal Direction Finding. One of the new types of radio receiver could not only pick up a signal, but also detect the geographical location it came from. So a codebreaker stymied by a signal's encryption could at least determine the location of a potential American adversary.After the Japanese Navy's stunning defeats of the Russian Navy in 1905 and the Germans in China in WWI, the US Navy decided that Japan would be its most likely Pacific adversary in any future war, and eventually rotated Rochefort to Japan for 3 years of round the clock intensive Japanese language training. There he met and befriended Naval Attache Edwin Layton, also receiving language training. However, his additional Attache duties didn't give him time to do what Rochefort did: bicycle in to town and immerse himself in Japanese culture. There Rochefort started conversations with locals and endlessly asked questions about Japanese culture, politics, and society.As a result, when the US Navy set up codebreaking stations at Pearl Harbor, the Philippines, and Washington, DC in early 1941, Rochefort was promoted to full Commander and assigned to head the approximately 60-man ""Station Hypo"" at Pearl. He was actually the best cryptananalyist, direction finder analyst, and Japanese language translator in the room, but he couldn't do it all at once. His job was to help the others do their specialties, then combine them with his knowledge of Japanese culture and politics to determine the Japanese Navy's next move (he would have predicted the Pearl Harbor attack if his unit hadn't been exclusively assigned to the wrong Japanese code).In short, Rochefort was America's version of Alan Turry (""The Imitation Game"" - 2014), minus the lack of social skills, homosexuality, and the building of a computer.And BTW, the USS California's band members were only used as clerks and go-fers - Nimitz never said ""I'm not generally predisposed to trusting a bunch of tuba players led by a man wearing fuzzy slippers"" - that would have been a severe insult to codebreakers Tommy Dyer, Joe Finnegan, Jasper Holmes, Red Lasswell, Mac Showers, and Ham Wright (and it was Holmes who devised the false Midway ""water distillation plant breakdown"" message to prove ""AF"" was Midway). Another BTW: Rochefort wore carpet slippers and a smoking jacket over his uniform for practical reasons: the only source of fresh air in the windowless, secret-door locked ""basement"" was a humungous air conditioner that made Rochefort feel cold during his 18 and 24-hour shifts. And the real Nimitz never even visited Hypo-but on the 2 occasions Rochefort was summoned to Nimitz's office, he showed up in in a fresh spit and polish Navy uniform.Too bad the storywriters/screenwriters didn't consult Elliot Carlson's 2011 definitive biography ""Joe Rochefort's War"" to learn what I've written so far. And in his book ""The United States Navy: 200 Years,"" author retired USN Captain Edward Beach writes: ""To Commander Joe Rochefort must forever go the acclaim for having made more difference, at a more important time, than any other naval officer in history."" Sure Rochefort was never shot at, but he endangered his health from the long stressful sleepless hours he worked in the constantly damp and smoke-filled Station Hypo.My second complaint: a grievous omission in the film is the impact the brave dive bombers from the USS Yorktown and USS Lexington in the Battle of the Coral Sea had on the Midway Outcome: by inflicting enough damage on the Japanese carrier Shokaku and destroying enough planes from the Zuikaku, the US flyers ensured the 2 carriers couldn't participate in the Battle of Midway as intended. This evened the odds for Midway: the Japanese came with 4 carriers, and after the miracle patch-up of Yorktown at Pearl, the US had 3, with Midway Atoll itself functioning as an unsinkable 4th. If the Japs came with 6, the outcome might have been different. Coral Sea also made the Yorktown pilots the only battle-experienced flyers at Midway - while movie hero Wade McClusky led his pilots to almost zero fuel by not factoring in the necessity that the Japanese carriers would have to make a 60-90 degree left turn in order to launch their planes into the wind, the Yorktown pilots factored correctly, and even though they launched later, they effortlessly arrived over the Japanese carriers at the exact same time as McCluskey's squadron, which the film never showed. (And the carrier Soryu was sunk exclusively by YORKTOWN pilots, not Enterprise, which the film also didn't show.)Lastly, Dick Best was not the only pilot that scored hits on 2 Japanese carriers on the same day, as the screen notes imply - his FELLOW ENTERPRISE PILOT Dusty Kleiss did also!! The McClusky character's screen time onboard the Enterprise could have been given to Kleiss onboard and in the air, with McClusky's screen time limited to just when he was leading his squadron (he never said ""What is Best doing?,"" because the real Dick Best never practiced landing without flaps).The entire story of the Doolittle Raid and it's aftermath is so long, detailed, and full of drama that it should be a movie itself (like it was in 1944 - ""Thirty Seconds over Tokyo,"" which didn't show FDR's, Captain Low's, and Captain Duncan's contributions, nor the civilian Chinese people being killed for hiding and leading Doolittle's men to the free Chinese capital at Chongqing). The raid also did not affect the Midway Battle's outcome.If I had written the story/script, I would've skipped Dick Best's landing practice without flaps (which never happened), the Pearl Harbor attack, the Enterprise's attempted retaliation, Ernest King's appointment of Nimitz, and the Marshall Islands Raid. Start with a grim-faced Nimitz on a small torpedo boat being given his first tour of the smoldering wrecks at Pearl, followed by the movie's great early CGI shot of the Enterprise from bow to stern (but as returning to Pearl), then show Rochefort's self-blame at not predicting the attack, then flashback and show a quick synopsis of how Rochefort ended up commanding codebreakers at Pearl (and along with this could be Yamamoto's conversation with Layton) then show the B-25s already over Tokyo, introduce all the characters (including Kleiss, minimizing McClusky and real-time Layton, with ROCHEFORT talking sadly and worriedly to HIS wife instead of Layton or Best talking to theirs). Then move to the spine-cracking tension in Rochefort's ""basement"" as they grapple with Japanese code JN-25B and finally piece together enough to warn Nimitz of the impending attack and invasion of Port Moresby in the Coral Sea in early May, followed by the Battle of the Coral Sea, including the sinking of the Lexington and the damage to Yorktown. Then switch back to Rochefort's team decoding the long Japanese Order of Battle for Midway, Nimitz's and Washington's skepticism, and the ""AF"" water ruse. Follow this with a long full shot of Yorktown limping back into Pearl while trailing a 25-mile long oil slick, and Nimitz's order to all Pearl workers to immediately patch up Yorktown just enough for one roundtrip to Midway. Then proceed to the actual Battle of Midway from there, including Yorktown's involvement!!If Roland Emmerich and Wes Tooke were gung-ho on lots of pyrotechnics and battle scenes, it's too bad they didn't consider that they could've got them from Coral Sea instead of Pearl Harbor (which I believe is still taught in today's high school classrooms).BTW, the movie never explained the REAL reason the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. After the US cut off sales of oil to Japan, the Japanese realized they could only get oil by capturing the oil-rich ""Dutch East Indies,"" and they wanted to cripple the US fleet first to prevent it from aiding the Dutch. The movie's Yamamoto conversation with Layton might have led viewers of ANY age to think the Japanese attacked Pearl as retaliation for the US cutting off oil, or to get oil from the US by starting a war with us.",2.0,Anonymous,History
Everything a war movie needs (almost) and nothing it doesn't,"Finally a movie about ww2 with no stupid subplot.

It's got a lot going for it, star power, good storytelling ( even if you don't like detailed war strategy, it moves pretty well), and it looks good. The event to event is told from both Japanese and American perspectives, and that helps you understand the historical context of what the heck is this happening for.

Better than...,"I had skipped seeing this in theaters after hearing it was not that great. Came upon it the other night for streaming on IMDB TV. Just some quick thoughts: It's a great looking movie with spectacular visuals throughout. Occasionally aerial dog fights are a bit overdone but the dramatic drive of the movie is strong. Character development is above average for this type of movie and I cared about the characters. The writers chose to make this almost a documentary and many key characters are referenced in their real lives at the movie's close. One of my few disappointments was the moviemaker's choice not to fully explain the battle of Midway and how it finally played out, as the Japanese came back a day or two later and took out another carrier. But this would have strung out the movie and perhaps prevented a satisfying conclusion.The Japanese are well presented and played by skilled actors, from the high command down to soldiers and pilots. They are not one-dimensional but have the same emotions and patriotic intentions as the American characters. Yamamoto is especially well filled out as a character. The very brutal aspects of Japanese war crimes is also presented, and it comes as a shock.Yes, I recommend this movie!",7.0,Anonymous,History

Why can't they make a movie where airplanes actually act like airplanes?,"Pretty accurate in terms of history. I'm not an expert, but I am well read (Layton, Tully & Parshall, Symonds) and I really didn't see anything that drove me crazy the way Pearl Harbor did. The sequence at the very beginning of the movie with the SBD dive bomber landing like a yo-yo bugged me very much. Not possible. Broken airplane and lots of injuries would be the outcome, along with a grounded pilot in all probability. Kind of a turnoff, but in general I liked the film.

Fantastic in every way,I was genuinely amazed at how well done this was. Visually stunning. Excellently acted. It covered so many nuances and really brought home the hazards faced by the men who fought in WW2. Interactions on the home front with wives and children were also wonderfully portrayed.

Surprising,"I went into this with some trepidation as I am not a fan of Emmerich and his gung-ho approach to filmmaking, however some reviews from veterans seem to suggest this was historically accurate. Therefore i gave this a go and overall I would say it's pretty good. Certainly the research and script are decent with a lot of background and the guns-ho approach mostly kept in the background. The actors were all solid enough but the mostly 2nd division actors are what they are and even Woody Harelson was average here and some of the dialogue is cheesy but maybe not as much as I expected. As you might guess with an Emmerich film there is a lot of cgi. What is surprising is that overall it was well done and after a while I forgot it was cgi (and I usually hate cgi) and the battle seems were gripping. Finally a word about the critic reviews, I can only think they reviewed this prejudiced against Emmerich as it's decent, it's certainly more realistic and accurate that Dunkirk and though that's surprising and possibly controversial I would stand by that statement.",7.0,Anonymous,History

"A good companion to the 1976 movie ""Midway""","Covers some of the same ground as the original, but concentrated on different areas of the battle.To be sure, this is not a documentary. There are significant omissions and inaccuracies. To reviewers who harp on that, the question is why? It isn't billed as a documentary, so they should probably check their expectations. If you want to know how it really was, crack a book.The old ""Midway"" movie felt like a classic war movie. The new one had more of an action/adventure vibe to me. I don't knock it for that; I think it makes it more palatable to younger audiences who don't have living relatives that fought in the war. I know for me, my last relative to fight in the war died a decade ago.The movie has a long buildup to the battle, so it feels rushed in the end. Probably should have been longer by another hour, but then you lose the youngsters that this movie seems intent on educating/entertaining.Bonus: it didn't have a love triangle like ""Pearl Harbor"".",7.0,Anonymous,History

Acting Is this movie is so unbelievable. What were they thinking,I gave that title because until you see bad acting you can't believe it got off the cutting room floor. The CGI looks dated this I think is the Asian company it's just their level there look whatever.But the acting is sterile it's childish I guess the writer had something to do with that. You can't believe a single thing in this movie. So yeah I'm not on board with people giving the movie a high score. Not when so many other movies have been made where they can bring the viewer into the movie this one you're too much of an outsider and believe nothing.I was just so angry at the acting I gave it a 1 but if you like to just have a very light non-believable war movie that has cool looking scenes then it probably deserves maybe 5 of 10. But you're not going to like any of the actors there so bad it makes you think that a director must have a lot to do with their presentation arcana just be a bad combination of both.

Great Re-telling of a Decisive Naval Battle,"This is an engaging re-telling of the decisive Battle of Midway. While it pays tribute to the top brass that prosecuted the battle, the focus is on the pilots that made the difference such as Richard Best, Clarence Dickinson, and Wade Mc Clusky as well as the intelligence officers who pinpointed with great accuracy the location of the Japanese armada before the conflict erupted on June 4, 1942 such as Lt. Comdr Layton and Joseph Rochefort.On the Japanese side, you had the top brass like Yamamoto and his competent officers.This battle confirms what we know that miscalculations tilt the outcomes on the battlefront. And that intrepid intelligence-gathering (when acted upon) makes the difference.The use of CG scenes don't diminish the accuracy of the facts on the ground (or at sea, to be more accurate) and make the movie more compelling.Watch this film that brings us to a critical juncture in WW2. If the American naval fleet failed to prevent the push of the Japanese to Midway, Japanese forces could have overrun the Pacific coast of the US in no time at all with catastrophic consequences.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Good movie but it lacked,"One thing a War movie should not be is romantic, or for the whole family.I saw this movie 3 times and although it had some really good moments, I felt that it failed to deliver the desperation of WWII in the pacific, or the hardships of war. They showed one kid being afraid, like ""gee paw, I don't want to go do my chores."" The rest failed to capture the fear of combat. Much of the younger sailors it was either over doing it in some scenes--forced scenes, or they seemed completely helpless.Not sure why they had to do Pearl Harbor attack again, we are reminded of the movie Pearl Harbor when they turned it into a romance. Still, combat as opposed to showing family time, or a good time at the O club is better. The whole at the club or with the family scenes were not necessary. Much of the combat scenes were too neatly wrapped up, like some action spider man movie or something.Too much hot dogging with the pilots, too much kid like running their mouths, turning it into a fantasy, romanticizing war. It was better than 1917, but this didn't have the impact as a war movie like Fury, or Saving private Ryan. Why do people keep talking about the later movies? Because we were shown the horrors of war, not some Top Gun of WWII, ""hey bring the whole family, even the Musses can enjoy the movie too."" ""Look dear, dancing and singing at the club, and family time.""War movies should be war movies, not how to gentrify for the whole family. As a 30 year career Marine, and combat Veteran, I get what and how academia and hollywood thinks of the Military, and there is no excuse for it.I want hollywood to be daring, and bold, making war movies, not worried about who they are going to appease, offend, or how they can gentrify it. It's one thing to make fiction movies, but when an opportunity comes along to show a most important history of Western Civilization, it's all right there, they just have to re-enact it and do so in detail. Hollywood needs more Military advisors, not some how to appease everyone. Believe it or not, career Military go to all the same colleges as everyone else does, even the Ivy league ones and graduate top of our classes.Don't worry if the wives, libs, and girlfriends don't like war movies. They can watch something else. But when you do it right, it means other genre's can be appreciated equally, raising the bar for them, tearing down that PC gag or filter, that sugar coats movies into story lines all over the place.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Another Emmerich Spectacle, But This One's True","Since practically the dawn of cinema, there has been something about war films that have captured the attention of filmmakers and the public alike. Perhaps due to it taking place amid Hollywood's Golden Age, World War II especially has earned something of a prime spot. Midway, the latest film from Rolland Emmerich, proves that interest is still very much alive.In looking over Emmerich's filmography, there are usually three things one can be confident about going in knowing. The first is that he can assemble an excellent cast, and Midway is no exception to that. To tell the story of a tide-turning battle and the man who fought it, he's assembled one that takes in a wide range. There are the comparatively fresh faces of Ed Skrein and Luke Evans as the lead characters, two naval aviators who take viewers into the heat of battle. Elsewhere, established character actors like Patrick Wilson take us into the back rooms, as do the likes of Dennis Quaid and Woody Harrelson playing Admirals Halsey and Nimitz, respectively, showing the strategies been laid out at the upper levels of command. The Japanese side of the cast is equally steadfast, lead by Etsushi Toyokawa as Admiral Yamamoto. Meanwhile, the civilian side of the war comes from Mandy Moore's character, the wife of Skrien's pilot, though it is something the film doesn't give much time toward portraying. On the whole, though, they do an excellent job bringing the history to life sincerely.The second point of confidence is that an Emmerich film will be a special effects feast. Midway, too, scores on that point. From the attack on Pearl Harbor that comes a short way into the film to the Doolittle raid and the climactic ait attacks during the titular battle, the film does everything in its power to make viewers feel like they're flying alongside these men. Something which the film does with some fine CGI work that creates everything from early war Hawaii, to the ships and planes involved. Combined with all the other tricks of the trade, from the editing of Adam Wolfe to the score from frequent Emmerich collaborators Thomas Wander and Harald Kloser, the result is some of the finest aerial dogfights you're likely to see anytime soon.The final thing on our Emmerich checklist regards the script. As has been the case throughout his career, but especially in the last decade or so, he's a director with a habit of getting ones full of interesting ideas but often cliched or merely functional dialogue. Midway, though based around historical events, does suffer from some of these faults as well, especially where its dialogue is concerned though the actors do their best with it, helping to mitigate the worst of it.On the other hand, it's the historical elements that make Midway stand out. In presenting what is essentially a Cliff Notes version of the early Pacific War, Emmerich and writer Wes Tooke pack a largely accurate history lesson inside an action movie. Viewers get to see battles going down, the decisions leading up to them, and what it was like to face life and death during them. It allows the film to cover a lot of ground in a mere138 minutes, something which isn't always to its advantage (as the short-shifting of things like the Doolittle Raid and an underutilized Aaron Eckhart can attest). Despite that, it's hard not to think of it as the best script he's had since at least 2012 and maybe even longer ago than that.Indeed, one might go so far as to call it Emmerich's best film since that 2009 outing. It has all the ingredients of his better work, as well as some of the flaws, and tells a fascinating real-life story to boot. Along the way, it also proves one adage to still be true: that truth can be just as compelling, and stranger, than fiction.",8.0,Anonymous,History

CGI's could have been better but still a good movie.,"I can't tell you if the story is accurate or not, for that I don't have enough knowledge on this subject matter, but the truth is that this movie is well made and entertaining. First of all you have an excellent cast, great names and that shows in the acting. Then you have some excellent fighting scenes, even though I thought the CGI's could and should have been much better as it's made in 2019 and we're just used to better now. But that's a minor negative, it doesn't really affect the suspense in those fight scenes. Midway is a quite long movie but it's never boring. Maybe the tactical decisions aren't really clear, or in my case don't make any sense at some point, but still it's entertaining and that's what I wanted so no complaint from me.

Great tribute to WWII story,"I think an interesting aspect of this historical event (Midway) is how we (US) were the underdogs, not only because of the losses at Pearl Harbor, but because the war machine wasn't in great shape. It's just one small part of the War and one perspective (a Hollywood one), but it does do the job of letting viewers feel more and reflect more on those events, and pause to consider great men and how fortunate our country is.

Almost a good movie. Almost. Entirely by Accident.,"Several factors of this production work against it to be a fully engaging piece of *cinema.* The production values-CGI especially-are all fairly cheap and are pretty far from convincing on the photographic level. However, they are slanted just enough to feel oddly stylized. This separates the film from being just warmed over WWII stuff.Likewise, the script as a *story* is quite messy. There are too many main characters and subplots to follow. Certain narrative threads get dropped. Others feel rushed or incomplete. The plotting such as it is feels haphazard. I am not entirely sure why the Doolittle raid was included. But this results in a panoramic take on history and it was sort of nice to see the lived experience not forced into a conventional story.This film doesn't add up to much but it is an inoffensive way to get a primer on the military history and operations.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Great War Movie with Accurate Facts,"One good thing about this movie is that it has a great cast which each important character has its own fair share of time and it sticks to the facts pretty well. From the start to finish, there isn't much dull moments and there is always something heroic actions and building up characters which is important for the later scenes.There is a balance scenes and moments between Americans and the Japanese which is quite a good thing as isn't biased on any side. The movie kinda have many great historic moments alongside with the CGI scenes not the best as practical effect from Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, but it's still pretty impressive on some of the scenes.However the score of the movie does lack a little, and it just needs a little more punch and more dramatic score to match up with those battle moments, just a bit lack of tense in the music design.Overall not bad for this movie.

"I didn't think it would be as bad as everyone said, but it really is THAT bad.","Movies about World War II is, for whatever reason, somewhat of an obsession for me. At this point I think I've seen just about every movie there is on the subject, including those in the Criterion Collection (which are some of the best). Oddly enough, despite its $100 million budget, I had never heard of Midway until recently. So of course I came here to IMDB to check out the reviews and decide if it was worth watching. Most of the negative reviews seemed focused on the film's use of CGI, but I decided to watch it with an open mind because I cared more about the story than how it was going to look.I'm here to tell you now, the bad reviews for Midway are completely justified. The reason I pointed out how many movies I've watched on the subject of WWII, both Hollywood blockbusters and independent films, is to give you a sense of how large my scale of reference is in determining that Midway is probably the WORST WWII movie I've ever seen. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of one is because the one great thing about this movie is the sound design. The Atmos mix on Midway is mind blowingly good. It seems like out of everyone who worked on the production of this film, nobody cared except the Sound Department. They did a great job and deserve a shout out.So what makes this movie so bad? Well, there are a LOT of issues with it. But I hold Roland Emmerich, the film's director, the most responsible for Midway's shortcomings. For some strange reason, watching it gave me flashbacks of being in college. We were always given essays to write as homework assignments. Sometimes students would start working on them right away, maximizing their time to the fullest to get their essay just right. But some students (like me) waited until the night before deadline to write their paper, making sure all the elements were met but without a whole lot of thought or effort.That's what I thought about watching Midway, like Roland Emmerich had to shoot this movie in a day and just had to hurry up and get it done. Of course, that's not literally true but you get my point, I hope. Everything about the movie is lazy. For starters, the acting is terrible. Ed Skrein's American accent is total cringe. This is despite some of the actors in this movie are actually capable of good acting. So to me, it's a sign of lazy direction; however the actor says their lines is good enough, as long as they say them. It feels like all their lines were delivered in one take without the director feeling like it could be better.The excessive use of CGI is also lazy. CGI is appropriate in fantasy films to bring objects to life that don't exist in the real world. But that cannot be said for this film. Planes exist. Ships exist. Oceans exist. Pyrotechnic departments exist to create real explosions. None of those things were used. Not only was relying SOLELY on CGI lazy, but the actual CGI itself was lazy. It doesn't even remotely look realistic or high quality. The Lord of the Rings trilogy came out 20 years ago and had higher quality CGI than this.But even you can overlook the terrible acting and excessive (and unnecessary) use of CGI, there's still a major issue with the movie: the lack of a human factor. There just isn't one anywhere. The characters are disconnected from one another. The story does not invoke a single emotional response. We are supposed to be watching a movie based on one of the most major naval battles in history and yet I didn't care. I felt nothing. I didn't connect with the people or the event, because there was no reasons given as to why I should. There's no explanation for why anything is happening and for what reason.What I found myself asking at the end of this movie, was why did Roland Emmerich make it? What was the message he was trying to convey? Is Midway an anti-war movie or pro-war? Is it even a war movie or just over two hours of a video game cut scene? I have no idea. I don't think this movie has a point to make. CGI and an all-star cast does not a good movie make. Nothing can substitute for a memorable storyline, which Midway does not have.This is a film about actual events from a dark period in history. Most films about WWII leave me with a profound feeling of sadness but also with a better understanding of not only WHAT happened, but WHO it happened to. That tends to happen more in movies that focus on just a few central character arcs instead of movies like Midway where the focus is on too many people that you know nothing about. I hate to say it, but in a way I feel like this movie was disrespectful to the event itself by choosing to eliminate the human elements and focusing entirely on elaborate CGI battles that don't even look realistic. WWII movie enthusiasts should stay away from this one.",4.0,Anonymous,History

Like a 2 hour electronic war game nothing new to add,"My Review - Midway
My Rating 6:5/10
I've said before I'm not a fan of War films but top quality productions like Dunkirk , 1917, and the great Australian movie Danger Close : The Battle of Long Tan I really enjoyed and they're easy to praise for their great script and production values but Midway is nowhere near the standard of those films.In my opinion ""Midway "" a modern remake of the 1976 film starring Charlton Heston, Henry Fonda ,James Coburn and Glenn Ford has probably superior special effects but I didn't engage with this retelling at all probably because I knew the outcome but more because the script was so poor. As an example the wife of Dick Best played by Ed Skrein when told her man is possibly shot down in battle says emotionally that she has to powder her nose some more"" and the same Ed Skrein ( I'm sure he was channeling the late John WAYNE) when rallying his men says something along the lines of ""the wagons are circling and we'll shoot em down one by one "" There's something so predictable about scripts in
most not all American War movies.
The Hollywood Studios wouldn't touch Midway
* Roland Emmerich Director of Independence Day, 2012 and The Day After Tomorrow couldn't interest Hollywood studios in the US$100 million on for the project .Director Roland Emmerich would even take trips to Beijing to meet with potential Chinese financiers. In the end, the production received close to US$24 million from Chinese investors including Starlight Group, which funds Emmerich's company Centropolis .
It will be interesting to see if the Chinese investors get their investment returned?
So far the estimated budget for Midway was USD 100,000,000 so far Worldwide it's made a total of $123.3 million so it's possibly a modest box office success but certainly not a critical success.For those who like American War Films or that genre in general the visual effects are outstanding but the script and some of the performances are "" B""grade in my estimation. I don't enjoy electronic War games and felt I'd been playing one for 2 hours as it's mainly battle scenes throughout and while it's a fitting tribute to the brave men who fought in this horrific battle and those who lost their lives at Pearl Harbour it's all been done before and adds no new perspective but that's just my opinion.",6.0,Anonymous,History

"On-par with ""Pearl Harbor"" (2001), which means it's not that great...","""Pearl Harbor"" (2001) was a solid 6/10 movie, and this movie isn't much better... This movie has an absolute TONNE of CGI, and it's the kind of CGI where you can actually see that it's clearly CGI. I actually laughed at the begining of the movie, where they showed a bunch of CGI guys running on the deck of a ship, and I was like ""Humans don't run like that!"". You could SO CLEARLY see that it's CGI, like why didn't they just get a real ship to run on? According to the wikipedia page, they actually did shoot some scenes on a real battleship, so why was it deemed necessary to show fake CGI guys running on a ship? It is confusing and hilarious at the same time.Appart from that, Ed Skrein's fake american accent really made my ears bleed through the entire movie... I don't get why he couldn't just talk normally... I'd rather listen to justin beaver music on loop, than listen to another second of Ed Skrein's fake accent in this movieI liked the fact that they atleast ATTEMPTED to show the battles from the perspective of the Japanese. The scenes are few and far between, but they tried showing a different perspective at least.Overall, the movie has way too much CGI and not enough of the Japanese's perspective, but it's an OK movie if you want to watch a war-film for 2hours. 6.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,History

So many reasons I loved this...,"'Midway' is what 'Pearl Harbor' should have been. Although the visuals were far more superior in 'Pearl Harbor', 'Midway' was more realistic, with a better story.'Midway' had none of the cliched characters Hollywood is known for. There were no idiotic comic relief characters, no arrogant or bombastic characters. It was also refreshing to see there was no overbearing love interest (which ruined 'Pearl Harbor', by the way). There were none of the stereotypical characters that feature in most films of this genre. Nope, this film concentrated on telling a good story and succeeded gracefully.The film has an old-fashioned feel to it, and I'm not referring to the time period. The visuals to some of the scenes were reminiscent of 70's disaster movies. Some scenes looked like video games. Fact is, the visuals were not always all that spectacular, yet in a way it made the film more enjoyable. 'Midway' certainly must be a real treat for history buffs.I enjoyed the film for its realism and simplicity. It was never over-dramatic or sentimental. It was easy to follow without twists or a complicated premise. For a film running 138 minutes, I found it interesting all the way. Well done, Roland Emmerich.Would I watch it again?

A BAD REMAKE OF THE ORIGINAL MOVIE OR AS HAMMY AS THEY CAN GET!!,"This film should win the Raspberry Award for the worst film of the year. It is a cheap remake of the 1976 movie of the same name but which had real actors in the cast which this film did not. The cast consisted of would bes that probably were extras in high school dramas. The original film had a cast of Charlton Heston, Henry Fonda, Glen Ford, Hal Holbrook, Robert Mitchum. James Coburn , Cliff Robertson, Robert Wagner, Eddie Albert just to name a few. The best this film could come up with was a hamWoody Harellson who never could act his way out of a wet paper bag and is horribly amatuerish in this film.I have a special interest in the Battle of Midway. As a youngster, my father was stationed on Midway when the war broke out. He survived a shelling on December 7 which was nothing compared to the pasting Midway took during the Battle of Midway while he was there. It was a very tense time for my mother and her children at this time.About all the makers of the film achieve is some degree of accuracy in the details of the equipment shown in the film. The film uses a lot of special effects that were not available in the original film but the original film depicts the events more accurately and it was much easier to understand. One of the problems with this film, is it tries to go to far back to tell the story by trying to make an intelligence officer seem more prescient than he actually was. The film also tends to exaggeration in trying to make its heroes bigger heroes than they were. That was unnecessary because they were great heroes without any exaggeration.One inaccuracy was the depiction of the Japanese killing a captured American aircraft crewman
by throwing him off a ship tied to an anchor. In fact, the Japanese would never have wasted a useful anchor and actually tied him to water filled fuel cans. Except for the execution, the scene like many in the film, is fiction because the only record of the execution was a brief entry in a ship's log. All three of the captured American airmen were similarly executed.While the Battle of Midway was the beginning of the end of the war, one thing that is ignored in the film is as decisive as it was, it still could have been disastrous for the U.S. in that after the carrier warfare ceased, the Japanese had a very strong armada that could have easily taken Midway even though the Japanese no longer had any carriers. Even though the U.S. had two carriers left, neither had enough aircraft or crews to do anything to deter the Japanese had they chosen to continue their attack on Midway.My recommendation is that people who want to watch a movie about the Battle of Midway should watch the 1976 version.",1.0,Anonymous,History

In my opinion the highlight should be the dog fight, especially the bullet traces from the cockpit really great! I do not think any movie has done it this good. In the heart of the movie delivered a very fast phase but i bet you will stay on track and follow right through it. It is an American propagada to win the war but certainly this does not make the other look bad. I salute Japanese patriotism towards the end.

Midway (2019) vs. Midway (1976): and the winner is...,"""Midway"" (2019 release; 138 min.) brings the story of the WWII battle of Midway. As the movie opens, it is ""December 4, 1937"", and British, US and Japanese dignitaries are exchanging toasts in the name of peace. We then go to ""December 7, 1941"", as the Japanese are starting to attack Pearl Harbor... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is directed by Roland Emmerich, yes, he of ""Independence Day"" (and its sequel), ""2012"", ""White House Down"", and so on. That is really all you need to know to put this latest version of ""Midway"" into perspective. Character development is minimal, but who cares anyway, as we all await the battle scenes. Once they come, starting with Pearl Harbor and culminating in the movie's last hour with the actual battle of Midway (on June 4, 1942, amazingly only 6 months after Pearl Harbor), all restraint is thrown overboard, and it's almost an assault on the senses. And yes, quite enjoyable. The thing is that the battle scenes are perfect, frankly too perfect. Think of it like watching video games on steroids. I can't help but think back to the 1976 movie of the same name covering the same events (starring Charlton Heston and Henry Fonda), when CGI was not available and the movie makers used other means (including actual archival footage from the battle). While I enjoyed the Roland Emmerich re-imagination of Midway better than I expected, I nevertheless feel that the 1976 movie is slightly better, or perhaps I should say that it feels more realistic. Please note: Emmerich financed this $100 million production movie independently outside the Hollywood studio system, and he ended up getting a sizable part of the budget financed through Chinese investors. That comes at a cost of course, and hence the script makes a couple of unnecessary, if not questionable, detours into China's role (?) in the battle of Midway. A darn shame.""Midway"" opened wide several weeks ago, and I finally got around to seeing it. The Friday matinee screening where I saw this at the day after Thanksgiving was attended okay (about 20 people in a large theater).

To be fair the script is terrible so the actors here haven't got much to manoeuvre with but the main character being played by a badly miscast Ed Skrein was surely an oversight.

Much Better Than Average WW 2 film - Midway 2019,"This film comes about 40 years after the original made in the late 1970s, which obviously suffered from far less dramatic special effects. In addition to much better special effects, the lead actors other than Henry Fonda from the original, all do a better job in this one. The actor portraying Flyer Best does a pretty good job of hamming it up and projecting just about every stereotype you have ever seen in a WW 2 flyboy film. However, despite this over the top approach, the carefully edited and directed film is superior to the original in those areas as well. One criticism I did have about the storyline however, was the Doolittle sequence, which really only skimmed the surface of what could have been a far more meaningful few scenes depicting how the Chinese got him out of the country and the terrible losses they suffered under the Japanese, whom they hate to this day. This is precisely why the Chinese investors of this film will turn a very nice profit. Showing the film all over China to people who still hate the Japanese is money in the bank. I predict the film will be a big hit in China, and one of the biggest grossers of the year in China as well.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A more mature remake of a classic....,"I remember as a young boy being accompanied by my father to see the original Midway. It was a polished film but even back then, the suffering and death, shocked me on a certain level.The new film does a decent job of recapturing the original but also balances the historical books, by acknowledging the suffering and courage on the part of combatants, on both sides and the price paid by Chinese who helped US servicemen downed in Japanese occupied China.It shows a maturity of story telling, rarely seen in my experience of Hollywood these days. It;s refreshingly free of politically correct posturing or revisionist history, which was nice to see too. Its a simple, tragic story, of young lives lost defending their homelands and their respective ideals.The combat scenes are well shot if a little hard to take seriously on occasion. Still it IS Hollywood, so some dramatic license is to be expected. Acting is surprisingly polished with some casting choices I would not have picked, that worked remarkably well.7/10 from me.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Solid portrayal of critical battle with decent acting and excellent effects,"Was impressed by the film, which turned out to be better than I expected, certainly better than the 1976 ""Midway"" and vastly better than Michael Bay's ""Pearl Harbor"", which I consider to be a cartoon. You get a good history lesson on the first six months of the Pacific war, the portrayal of the intelligence efforts to set the stage for the battle is well done, the acting is decent for this kind of epic movie, and the CGI effects are excellent. Some of the battle scenes are actually terrifying, even though you know how events are going to turn out. Is it a perfect movie? Of course not, some of the inevitable war movie cliches crop up, and some facts get fudged, such as where the actions of U.S. fighter planes in the battle, as noted by others, are completely omitted, but still a good, respectable effort.",8.0,Anonymous,History

"Not bad, actually","All things considered, this was a pretty good genre flick. The story was elementary, men in war. With not a lot of needless psychiatric expose, Basic in the ""guys caught in a maelstrom, with no choice but to do as they're trained to do""vein. Not a lot of soul searching or wrestling with the deadly, dangerous task at hand. If you're looking for ""Platoon"" keep looking. This is more in the vein of ""Private Ryan"" without the nervous tremors.The dialog for the most part exists only to advance the story. Some of the dialogue is reduced to period piece, Gung Ho, rubbish, but it's not important to the narrative.The effects were adequate for the settings. There is the slight feel of computer combat flight sim to much of it. A lot of exploding airplanes and ships and a blizzard of anti-aircraft fire. A cacophony of explosions. Perhaps a little overcooked, but, hey, it's Hollywood and everyone was having fun.The cast was interesting. Harrelson was adequate as Nimitz as was Quaid as Halsey. Neither had a big stretch to make. Patrick Wilson as Ed Layton was underwhelming. Frankly, I thought he was not nerdy enough for his role. The rest of the cast did their part. The story was the star in this picture. Except for Ed Skrein, who absolutely nailed the role of Dick Best. A lot has been said about his accent with some of the Corporate critics calling him out for his ""Jersey"" accent. Let me tell you, the accent was absolutely perfect. Perfect to a point where, being a native of New Jersey, I guessed the location of Best's actual home within 10 miles, only on the basis of Skrein's acting. Best was from Bayonne, NJ, but I didn't know that until I looked it up, I had guessed Newark. And then to learn Skrien is a Brit, well, Bravo, sir, well done.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Historically Accurate?,"I was all set to go see this movie on Veterans Day weekend.
However, after watching the preview clip, I had second thoughts about going.
First, it shows twin-engine Japanese bombers bombing the US carriers at Midway.
They look like Mitsubishi 3GM ""Nell.""
Although in service with the Imperial Japanese Navy from 1935-1945, they were land, not carrier-based aircraft.
The closest Japanese-held airbase for them to take off from would have been at Wake Island.
With a range of some 2,400 miles, the could have flown the 2,054 nautical miles from Wake to Midway and back, with 346 miles to spare.
However, Wake's airfield at that time would have been too small to handle a large number of land-based twin-engine aircraft.
Moot point, though, none of the histories of the battle I've read (books, not unsubstantiated web sites) report the presence of land-based Imperial Japanese Navy bombers.",1.0,Anonymous,History
"Just the facts, Jack","Intelligence officer Edwin Layton (Patrick Wilson) warns that a Japanese attack is imminent, but his advice is disregarded and the Japanese use their carrier fleet to attack Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. Admiral Chester Nimitz (Woody Harrelson) swiftly assumes command of the heavily weakened US Pacific Fleet. After the Doolittle air raid on Tokyo & Honshu 4.5 months later, events lead up to the Battle of Midway on June 4-7, 1942. Ed Skrein plays cocky pilot Dick Best while Dennis Quaid is on hand as carrier commander William ""Bull"" Halsey.""Midway"" (2019) tackles the Battle of Midway and events leading up to it without throwing in a dramatic fictional story, like the love triangle of ""Pearl Harbor"" (2001). While I loved ""Pearl Harbor"" and proudly stand by it, ""Midway"" chooses to stick to the facts and is thrilling from beginning to end. The main cast members are all real-life figures and there's a tribute to each at the close.This is superior to the 1976 movie because Roland Emmerich had the CGI technology to pull off the battle scenes which take place in & above the Pacific Ocean near the atoll of Midway, which is located a little over a thousand miles west of Hawaii.

"Excellent visualisation and plotting, but oh my word - the dialogue...","This does a very good job of contextualising the battle and the presentation of the combat sequences is well executed (yes, the ships are far closer together than they would really have been, but that is a necessary narrative fiction) and that makes a lot of the film very good. That it didn't quite capture how the Japanese came to be caught without air cover, and some of the losses taken on the US side being a bit underplayed, are minor quibbles.But oh my word, the dialogue. Groan-inducing, cliche-ridden and stilted. There is something amis when the sub-titled Japanese dialogue feels more natural than some perfectly competent actors. Some absolute pukka genuine heroes, real people of astonishing courage, being portrayed in such a stilted manner is a real shame.These heroes really did deserve at least another round with some talented script editors.But worth your time if you are a war film completist.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Too Much Going On,"We didn't need to spend so much time on the ""Japanese viewpoint"", who cares, they tried to take over the world alongside the Nazis, that's all we need to know for a WW2 combat movie. It created too many subplots jumping back and forth to fixate on handsome Japanese guys with furrowed brows and scowls explaining themselves and their motivations.Ed Skrein is just terrible all around. What's with that dumb accent? Oh he's supposed to be a ""Jersey Boi"" except no one actually talks like that. What was with the turning off parts of the plane while attempting to land during a training exercise? Then his motivational pep talk gets a pilot who knew he wasn't ready to fly killed later on?Woody Harrelson is oddly convincing as Admiral Nimitz, perhaps the only good performance in the whole movie.The action sequences look more like the multi-ship combat from Star Trek Discovery or something, also too much going on. Tiny things flying around on screen shooting at each other. Who is shooting at who? Top Gun Maverick is silly but at least you knew who the ""evil"" pilots were with evil pilot close-ups in the cockpits. Here we have anonymous gray planes shooting at other gray planes.The only interesting subplot was with Aaron Eckhart, too bad the whole movie wasn't about that instead.Finally wives who don't seem to fully understand the fate of the world is at stake despite their war weary husbands repeatedly explaining it to them. Like ""why do you have to work so hard honey?"" Gee maybe because the Japanese will be landing troops in California if this fails? Why even have wife subplots in a war movie?

Bad reviews must be from civilians???,"This film definitely won't rank among the greatest war movies ever, but phenomenal all the same.
As an enlisted US Navy sailor of 19 years now, and having served aboard multiple aircraft carriers while attached to several different aircraft squadrons, I thought it was very well done. The culture has changed since that time, but people haven't. The focus on over the top emotions played out by combatants seeking vengeance on the Pearl Harbor attack was not overplayed, that was the same attitude across all military branches following the September 11 attacks. The raw emotions felt by soldiers, sailors, Marines and airmen when heading into an operational area is often intense and over the top.
The movie jumped a lot, and the pacing was fast, but all the events depicted were actually important in order to tell the story of Midway.
I read a review about the suicide bomber attack on the Enterprise, and Bruno Gaido saving the ship from a parked Dauntless bomber on deck, and then being meritoriously advanced two paygrades by Halsey was not only ridiculous, but also never happened? It absolutely happened, which is the only reason to even have it in the film. The purpose of this movie isn't to show the lives of the men and women that individually endured the war, or the overall emotions of the nation as a whole...this film's goal was to show the heroism displayed by American sailors onboard the highest decorated carrier in American history during the navy's most trying time and our most intense battle space to date.
The Navy holds our heritage above so many other things, and pushes us to learn as much as possible about our history. Was this movie perfect? No. Did it do a hell of a job in its representation of the rocky early days of the Pacific war and the sailors that fought valiantly against insurmountable odds? Absolutely.
If you want romance, bad writing, too much time spent on character building at the expense of accuracy, go watch Pearl Harbor. If you want a fantastic movie with a front row seat to one of the US Navy's greatest accomplishments, watch Midway.",9.0,Anonymous,History

One star because there is no zero star rating.,"I tried to find a redeeming quality in this movie, so here it is; I suppose they could have made it longer and doled out more punishment to the viewersThe acting was brutal. Ed Skrein; acting isn't your thing. It isn't all their fault though. The script was childlike in its development. There is nothing to figure out, there is no development of characters. It had to be someone's first draft.
Foreshadowing isn't a hint at a future plot event, is literally just explaining the plot just before it happens. There is so much cliche pilled into this mess, it makes it appear as though the only purpose of dialogue is to set up the next cliche.. Even the subtitles for the Japanese are inexplicably delayed so as to appear after characters have spoken, making it difficulty to tell who is saying what. How do you screw up the subtitle?? This movie does it. It tries to cover way too much in scope and does have disservice to all of it. All of it.The cinematography was just awful. A bizzare attempt to over saturate outdoor scenes yet all indoor scenes seemingly only have a single, small light source. Everything is too dark or too light.Finally, the effects. Best summarized as trying to out-Bey Bey, this movie has what I would unreservedly call the worst CGI mess I have ever seen. Following the mantra more is more, there is so much ridiculous clutter, half the scenes are just a spray of graphics. Planes don't fly like planes. They fly like a child imagines planes fly. As terrible as Bey's Pearl Harbor was for planes skipping wavetops to strafe in between battleships, Emmerich tells Bey to hold his beer. The mercilessly juvenile flight scenes are just painful to watch, defying physics, common sense and good taste.While I am sure, in theory, there could be a wise director out there than Emmerich, but nothing come to mind. This isn't a war movie, it's a disaster flick.""The Room"" at least had the excuse of being directed by an amateur without a budget. This show is but a half step behind that movie, unlike The Room, this will never achieve cult status. This will steal two hours of your life and make you question the future of the medium.If you want to watch a good movie about midway, watch the 1976 original. The 2019 version is pathetic.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Much better than the reviews said it was,"As usual, liberal critics who hate America and nationalism bashed this movie. I went in wanting to hate it completely, I had a discounted ticket and just wanted to get out to the theater because I'm working a very stressful job now. Ed Skrein did an amazing job and Roland Emmerich did an amazing job recreating 1940s America and the Navy. Many directors just choose to hire today's flavor of the day actors and won't even make them adopt period-accurate hair styles and personalities. Even Saving Private Ryan was pretty bad about that, with soldiers talking like they were from the modern day, haircuts that the actors wear everyday, there was just little effort put into recreating the period.I was pleasantly surprised at the battle scenes. From what I've read of the actual Midway battle, they got many of the details that I remembered fairly accurate. I'm no expert, but at no point was there any head-scratching moment like you saw in ""The King"" or ""Outlaw King"" where they had something ridiculous happen like the King of France trying to fight the King of England 1v1 and getting killed by some ordinary soldiers after slipping in the mud, lol! To make matters worse, that's a Netflix movie, not something commercially released in theaters!

Very accurate yet not,"I'm not a huge war movie fan. Having said that I am always asking for historical accuracy in my historical movies and this movie, from what I've read, is very accurate. So how come it doesn't look like it? This is probably Rolland Emmerich's fault as he really likes to blow things up, not as much as Michael Bay, but still very much. The screenplay seems built out of very historically correct bullet points but with a kind of propagandistic net around it. It's very strange as I know that what I'm watching is accurate, but at the same time seems blown totally out of proportion with a lot of heroes and flags, instead of real people. It's as if this was directed buy the Independence Day guy! On the technical side I didn't hate the cgi as most people did because I think the shots are kind of beautiful, but it is still clearly cgi which doesn't help the realism of it all. The actors were all fine and the set pieces were obviously well made. So this is clearly a very hard movie for me to rate, as on the whole i didn't like it that much, but the historical accuracy that I'm always arguing for is there, so it seems I'm never happy!

An Okay War Film,"Midway is about the Americans trying to predict the next thing the Japanese will do. They find out the next thing is they will attack at Midway.

One thing for example is the CGI. It was terrible. It was only good if it was in the distance. Besides that, it was terrible. It was so easy to tell if there was a green screen. They could have spent more money on the CGI. I thought the story was good. The only thing I didn't like about it was how much jumping around there was. You didn't really know what was going on. How many characters there were also didn't help that. The score wasn't bad. It made the movie feel more of a navy movie and that was good. There were some intense sequences in this film too. They made you want something and if it didn't happen you would almost get mad. That is a job well done. This movie also gave you a good perspective on how hard it is to hit a ship with a bomb. You see the Michael Bay movie Pearl Harbor and you think it is a fox trot. You watch this and you see how hard it is.

Good Movie But Left An Important Character Out Of It,"Good movie, but could have been better. Acting is very good and the story is fairly consistent with what happened (although Hollywood took license with some things). It's biggest problem is that Dusty Kleiss is not featured at all. He dropped 3 bombs on 3 different carriers. He was probably the most important pilot at Midway and crucial to the success of the operation. Knowledgeable people are well aware of Dusty Kleiss and it is a real failing of this film that his importance is not recognized in this movie. It is almost as if they took the Charlton Heston version and just updated it to 2019.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent Portrayal of Critical Naval Battle,"This movie kept my attention from start to finish. I especially thought Patrick Wilson was brilliant as LCDR Layton, lead intelligence officer for Admiral Nimitz who accurately assessed the Japanese fleet's intent to take the Midway Islands. Most people today don't understand what a pivotal battle this was in the Pacific Theater because had the US lost at Midway, the Japanese would have controlled the Pacific for 10 years or more, and would've completely changed the complexion of WWII. Only a little too much CGI kept me from awarding a perfect 10. Grade: A-.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Popcorn WWII movie,Visual and sounds effects were great. Story is simple and the acting was B-level. Too many side characters trying too hard to sound like the innocent naive 1940s soldier. By doing so made the movie more like a made for TV event. This would be perfect for my 8th grade students to watch when teaching the Pacific Theater. I wasn't bored and the story kept moving but I was expecting a better script and not cheesy acting.,6.0,Anonymous,History

Very well done .....,"This film was very well done and the two hours went by so fast. No fake love interest in this movie or any person of color getting a cameo or being a token was represented. The only negative, the pilots did not go from carrier to Hawaii as often as it was shown. These pilots were at sea for 3/4 of the war, not going back home and hitting the officers club every other week as portrayed. Overall, the film is very good.

The Battle of the Coral Sea is barely mentioned yet it was far more crucial to the events at Midway as it evened up the odds.We learn a little of the information gathering, almost none of the strategy and lots about the heroics of the pilots.

It's a bit better than Perl Harbor (2001).,"The cast look great, the costumes look great and it's a true story that just lends itself to film - the surprise attack on Pearl through to the epic battle of midway, and everyone knows it, freeing the writers of having to explain every little thing.But something's off. Whilst it doesn't go off on a weird 3 way relationship arc that absolutely nobody wanted, the special effects and amount of over the top action scenes are actually even more Michael Bay than the 2001 movie by him. It's an aerial/naval combat movie - you don't need to play up the amount of explosions!The biggest crime is frankly bad, out of date CGI that ruins it, often looking more like a WW2 video game than a movie. Thr dialect and writing isn't bad, but it's not great and something is just really lacking so what are likely well delivered lines on set fall flat or seem out of place in the final edit.Dunkirk is a great example of what they could have done with the story, cast, crew and modern effects, but this movie comes in a lot closer to the afore mentioned afleck from 20 years earlier.On the plus side if you like explosions there's a lot, and if you love swaggering 40's GI stereotypes it's got a lot of those too.Not awful, just sad when you know how easily it could have been so much better!",6.0,Anonymous,History

Midway is better than the pro critics proclaim.,"The critics are right in that the movie is a little shallow in terms of plot and character development ... but the need to fill in the story of events leading to Midway in order to educate a 21st audience meant there is too little screen time to accomplish address those deficiencies. The end result is still a rousing drama despite knowing the forgone conclusions. The only things that detracted me were the little jabs against the Japanese demanded by the Chinese producers of the movie, so transparently added to the story line to further the real grievances the Chinese people still have against Japanese aggression.

It's absurd!! Roland Emmerich has put together an entertaining, grand scale film, it's human elements aren't as fleshed out as Saving Private Ryan but the battle scenes are the spectacle we would expect.

Not Awful,"Let's all agree that Pearl Harbor and the 1978 Midway were just thoughtless Hollywood cliche-fests that displayed no particular talent at storytelling.The 1970 film Tora Tora Tora brilliantly displayed the Japanese planning and the intel intrigues that preceded the attack. However, that film was hamstrung by really bad acting by the American cast.Now we have Midway 2019, which I find closer to Tora Tora Tora, but I'm heavily reminded of Starship Troopers, a film in which the initial acting was so bad it lowered audience expectations, so if the rest of the film is merely okay, it will seem better in comparison to the awful beginning.Midway starts with unbelievable cowboy ""I'm the only one who is right"" Hollywood cliche character. So right off the bat the cohesive teamwork and can-do attitude of early naval aviation is thrown out the door.The pre-battle intrigue was okay, but so subtle that most of the audience probably missed it. It's a major part of the actual leadup to the battle.Now a movie called ""Midway"" should actually have paid some attention to depicting the battle, but evidently Hollywood feels like screen time is better spent with the cliche ""yell while firing a machine gun"" and ""fire and 'splosions"". Totally missed elements of the battle:
1. Enterprise Hornet operated together, Yorktown by itself due to its slower speed resulting from Corral Sea damage.2. The Japanese thought Yorktown was sunk and no US carriers were present. When they learned of US carriers they thought it could be two carriers max. Japanese aircraft hit Yorktown twice during the battle, each time reporting that they had sunk another US carrier, so the IJN thought they had wiped out the US carriers.3. the battle was won by relentless attacks by US aviators that were chewed up by IJN zeroes. Wave after wave of low altitude torpedo bombers were shot down, but more kept coming. By the time the dive bombers arrived, the IJN air cover was all at low altitude defending against the torpedo bombers, and were thus able to attack with little opposition. The timing was plain dumb luck, the movie doesn't depict this or the heroic sacrifices of the torpedo bombers including the ill-fated B-26s.4. High altitude army bombers attacked the Japanese carriers, and while some of the bombs landed close tot he carriers, none hit. Being ever-optimists, the near misses were reported as hits. After the battle the army bombers returned to Pearl Harbor long before the naval aircraft did, so the newspapers got the story that army bombers had won the battle of Midway. This myth was finally dispelled after the war.5. We knew the Japanese would attack Midway at dawn, so all our aircraft took off pre-dawn and was thus available to attack the Japanese.These five points are stories that did not get told. I didn't even mention the heroism of Yorktown's crew, continually staying in the battle. Also, the heroism of the Japanese aviators as they ran their torpedo and bombing attacks can not be overstated.What we got was a movie with lots of CGI and a character who had been an over-the-top cowboy reduced to a disabled person due to faulty equipment. Like faulty equipment is the essence of the Midway story. Meh.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Yes, as others have noted the effects are slightly OTT and cartoonish and the prolonged plane dives on their bombing runs start to repeat by the end. For me the clunky dialogue is the biggest disappointment, with nothing left unsaid in case we miss what the meaning might be by visuals alone, treating the viewer as if they are incapable of independent thought process.Not awful but such a true story could and should have been treated with more care and consideration.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,History

They also made a great effort to explain the worry, confusion, and indecision of the fog of war.The story was accurate to the actual events. The coverage of the attack on Pearl Harbour alone is better than the movie with that name. The only critique I could have is that they stretched reality a bit with the dive bombing.

I didn't believe all the negative reviews. Boy was I wrong.,"From the start this whole movie is set up to make the Americans look like saints and the Japanese like the boogie man.
Reality and history FACTS tell a very different story.

In the beginning there is a scene with a plane landing on a carrier that is so beyond logic that only a person that is braindead would believe it.
And when the Japanese do their attack on Pearl Harbor it is a bloody miracle they didn't kill each-other with the way they are shooting their on-board cannons.
And then all that zoomed-in close-up shots of all the actors.
Why not zoom out a bit and show the scenery a bit more.My advise is to view this movie as an example of how a movie can be bad for all te wrong reasons.Now if you like to see a few good WWII pacific movies go and watch the original Midway from 1976.

Less obnoxious than Pearl Harbor but strangely less memorable.,"Roland Emmerich recreates the Battle of Midway in this updated war epic. World War 2 enthusiasts will enjoy the dogfights and battle scenes. The big cast do a decent job with their respective roles but few leave a memorable impact.Perhaps the standout is Ed Skrein who plays real life war hero Dick Best. Skrein plays it like a self assured matinee idol from the 1940s, but at least his character has a personality. Dennis Quaid and Woody Harrelson round out the cast as the seasoned officers. Harrelson's fake Nimitz hair looks absolutely absurd.Although the action scenes are reasonably well done, the visual effects don't look as polished as they did in Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor. Don't worry, this is a better movie than Pearl Harbor but that movie has way better CGI.The film has modest ambition as a throwback to the ensemble war epics of classical Hollywood with a deliberate patriotic vibe. It mostly succeeds but sometimes feels too safe riding on nostalgia.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Worthwhile, Enjoyable for Newbies to the Midway Conflict or Those Knowing A Lot about the Event","An excellent piece of story telling which draws you in and makes you care for the characters it portrays. I liked the CGI and special effects which showed how horrific and sudden attacks during war can be without straying into gore or getting caught into deep sadness over the tragic losses. The action swept you along and there wasn't much of a lull anywhere to go get popcorn. I didn't feel it went too long as one reviewer said but instead each of the scenes included added dimensions to the story and I would be hard pressed to cut any of them. Both the Japanese and American forces were portrayed well and it was made particularly more enjoyable by a cameo by one of my favorite actors David Hewlett (of Rodney McKay fame from Stargate Atlantis). I was hoping he would pop up later in the film, but no such luck. I would recommend it and will end up watching it again sometime. Worthwhile and made richer if you have some previous knowledge of the material and can add in some elements from other movies (like the Doolittle raids) or knowledge about the parallel stories touched upon in the movie. But it would still be enjoyable for a newbie who knew little of Midway or the conflict there.

'Halfway' would be a more fitting title,"World War II movies are so oversaturated at this point, right? Clearly Hollywood doesn't think so, as we keep getting served helping after helping of WWII casserole. 2019's remake of 'Midway' is a recent example.Directed by Mr. Disaster Movie himself, Roland Emmerich, 'Midway' boasts plenty of high octane action, special effects and speaker-blasting sound. Of course, even big-budget blockbusters can fall flat on their face if not executed well enough. In the case of 'Midway,' it's pretty much a mess, as Emmerich tries to make the film into something it's not designed to be.Still, there are a few bright spots. Woody Harrelson's portrayal of Admiral Nimitz is commendable, as he balances the dutiful strength he must exude with the immense pressure he deals with as he is elevated to the most important man on whose behalf the success of the United States' efforts during the war hinged. Aside from Harrelson, the rest of the cast is pretty disposable, with Ed Skrein coming off as irritating in his role of Dick Best and Nick Jonas being a questionable casting choice. Still, it's nice to see longtime actors like Dennis Quaid and Aaron Eckhart show up here.Despite the importance of the battle, there's nothing special about this telling of 'Midway.'

A Good (current) Attempt at Remaking A War Classic,"The effects / CGI & attention to small details (horrifying or otherwise) of war - eg the poor burning sailors shown (albeit at a tasteful distance) falling from ships during the Pearl Harbour attack...certainly advances in technology have allowed better combat 'epicness' when comparing this to 2001's 'Pearl Harbour' which obviously utilised more real life shots than here. I don't mind the pace, the time spent on critical characters (nice that they mix ideas & info from other films, like Halsey's hospitalisation etc). Characters are generally very well-played (Patrick Wilson, a classic gruff Dennis Quaid, Aaron Eckhart, Etsushi Toyokawa & Tadanobu Asano & Woody Harrelson is solid in a rare serious/historical role), the photography is just lovely & w/delightful vibrant Pacific colour in outdoor scenes, possibly a little dark in interior shots...my main issue w/this picture is some of the pilot & crew leads who (accepting the classic presumption of fighter pilot types & their common/assumed over-confidence) just stick w/their starting personas of attitutude & arrogance, being continuously disrespectful of authority etc in a number of the main roles (esp.Skrein) who'd been flying for some years & would've surely lost that act pre-war, let alone once a combat veteran, right through to young inexperienced crew/gunners who even once 'experienced' w/multiple combat sorties, act like its their 1st fresh-faced flight.

The film follows key soldiers involved in the aerial and naval warfare that ultimately led to victory for the American Forces. The film has a plethora of actors in roles throughout the film, with Mandy Moore being the only notable female character?There's a large ensemble cast at hand here. You see actors and then they disappear. A lot of them don't have good development and are there for their star power. Not sure if it was because the presentation of the story was dull or if the plot and characters just feel convoluted but I found myself checking the clock. Granted the wartime action is great to look at; something that never lets you down in Emmerich films is the action set pieces and its no different here.I did like that Emmerich also focuses on the Japanese soldiers and not just as faceless enemies. There's humanity to the characters which was a good touch, despite the American soldiers being very generic themselves. I wasn't expecting a whole lot so its not like I was let down by this. You just kind of know what you are getting yourself into with films like these. Maybe the film needed a little cheese and relationship drama like that of Pearl Harbor because that film was infinitely more entertaining. This is a by the numbers, going through the motions film, with pretty action sequences.5.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,History
Accurate And Way Better Than Expected,"As a WWII History buff, I found this movie entertaining and accurate. The movie ""Pearl Harbor"" pales in comparison. I took my sons to see this movie to learn, and they came home eager to learn more.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Midway a good war movie,"Midway is a true story about the planned attack on the midway by the Japanese and how the the Americans try to stop the attack as underdogs.The movie was a good war movie but felt messy at times due to the way time passed, you didn't know if 1 day past or 6 months. Many characters were being intoduced that didn't have a lot of depth to them and we really never get to be familiar with the main characters.The cinematography was good but CGI could have been better but still looked good in many scenes. Sound and music I didn't have any problems with. The action was intriguing due to the well made cinematography, sound and music and also good editing throughout the whole movie.To improve the movie I'd have liked to have been able to understand the Japanese and their point of view of the conflict to make me root for both sides which I think the movie tried in doing but didn't succeed in for me. The way Christofer Nolan depicted the Germans In Dunkirk would also have worked for this movie, I think. Where we only know what the Americans know making us afraid of the Japanese as we never know when they are going to strike which would have given more time to go to a greater depth with the characters.",7.0,Anonymous,History

"One of the better entries in Emmerich's filmography, but only barely","Midway is a war drama film directed by Roland Emmerich (Independence Day, The Patriot, 2012) based on the decisive Battle of Midway during World War II. Starring Ed Skrein, Patrick Wilson, Dennis Quaid, Aaron Eckhart, and Woody Harrelson, it is one of the better entries in Emmerich's filmography, but only barely.In 1941, America chooses to remain neutral to the ongoing conflict raging across the globe. On December 7th of that same year, the American naval base in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii is attacked by the Japanese, killing several people and forcing the US to enter the war. In the aftermath of this preemptive strike, the US stages the battle of Midway six months later, a subsequent retaliation against the Japanese at the US territory of the Midway Islands in the Pacific Ocean.There's no denying the actual effort being put into making it look as modern and unbiased as possible, but this retelling of the battle of Midway still has some glaring issues. For a start, the film treads cliched territory with corny dialogue and flat characterisation of its real life subjects. Lines such as ""This is for Pearl Harbor!"" and ""We have awoken a sleeping giant"", (the latter of which was taken from the 1970 film ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"") feel like the typical over-the-top Hollywood sentiment one would expect from a war film like this. In addition, most of the characters were underdeveloped, being pushed aside to make way for an action scene. All of this is a shame because I believe all of these problems could have been avoided if only there were a better screenwriter at the helm.Roland Emmerich, while I don't think he is a particularly good director, does actually handle this film surprisingly better than expected. According to some research, making a film about the Battle of Midway had been Emmerich's passion project for a considerable amount of time and it definitely shows at certain points. His choices in cinematography during the air battles are quite interesting, often featuring the pilots charging their way into enemy fire like the way an army of soldiers on the battlefield would advance into the crossfire on land. This style of creativity was previously shown in Emmerich's 2000 film ""The Patriot"", which was not a perfect film by any means, but came off as entertaining enough to prove that he could handle a film based on war with the right amount of precision and care to not be considered entirely terrible. In addition to this, I enjoyed the way he chose to show the differing viewpoints of the American and Japanese strategists as each side plans on how to deal with any potential attack. We see how the Americans tended to go for an all-out assault on their enemies while the Japanese were more about biding their time, patiently waiting out for the appropriate moment to strike.As mentioned earlier, most of the film's characters felt underutilised and underdeveloped. If you're going to make a film about a real historical event that went the way it did due to the figures involved, you'd better make sure you do their characterisation justice. There were some characters that I completely forgot about as they were only in one scene and then we never see them again until the ending coda. If it weren't for the fact that some of them were played by well-known actors like Dennis Quaid and Aaron Eckhart, I would not have realised their importance in the story. With that said, Ed Skrein's depiction of Lieutenant Richard ""Dick"" Best was the only person I felt had some dimension to him. Even though the British born Skrein's attempts at an American accent came across as cartoonish at times, in particular his liberal use of ""Goddamn it!"", he at least had some likeability and admirable traits that kept me invested in what he may end up doing next. There were also some nice scenes with him and his wife, played by Mandy Moore, that did remind the audience of what he is fighting for, apart from his country.In conclusion, while I do appreciate the effort Emmerich has gone to making something he has wanted for a long time, I believe he needs a better screenwriter to collaborate with. All of the potential is there in terms of his direction but the poor dialogue and character development is his biggest downfall. In spite of all this, I would much rather watch this film again than Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor.I rate it 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,History
Loved it,"I left entertained and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I plan on seeing it again tomorrow as well as this weekend.I think people do not know the difference between a ""documentary"" and ""based on a true story"". There are things that were glossed over or exaggerated but for the most part, pretty close to the actual events. I thought the action scenes were well done as well as the acting. There is one scene that felt a bit cheesy (not sure if it's the same scene people seem to be upset with) but it's a movie, not that big of deal.
My one issue is that some points of interest in the movie could have been elaborated more. If someone is going into this not knowing a lot of the battle, I can see why you may be confused. Overall, if you are a WWII guy, definitely a must see.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Not bad, but could of been better","So the naval air battles were well done (the CGI used to good effect) and generally the movie held true to the critical story it was trying to tell, but - I wish the Director and Screenwriters had sat down with Eastwood and his team to figure out why Flags of our Fathers and Iwo Jima just nailed, so this movie could have been nailed. Forget the 30 min Pearl Harbour intro, the cut away scenes to family life in Hawaii, the I'm not brave enough boss followed by an inspiring pep talk. This all detracted from what should have been the focus of the film... building tension. The Battle of Midway was a turning point not just in the War in the Pacific, but in modern history itself. The fate of the world spun on the point of a knife during those 48hrs and that's what this film should of aimed to make the viewer feel more acutely. It tried - and it was a decent go - but didn't quite nail it. But hey it was light years ahead of that horror show Pearl Harbour.
Acting was solid, action well done, characters - mostly believable (I thought the Imperial Japanese characters - extremely well written), and reasonably historical accurate.
Could have been 30 min shorter and more focused on building the tension, but overall - for those who enjoy a war drama, it did its job.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Terrible Garbage from Start to Finish,"Easily one of the worst movies I have seen in a long while. Full of bland cinematography, boring action, pointless and unlikable recreations of historical figures and more historical inaccuracies than I can even begin counting.

Overall in terms of genuine depiction of the battle it gives excellent story telling and making the battle vivid to the audience, yet in terms of storyline and appealing to audience who are not particularly into war or historical films, the acting could be inconsistent(some characters outshine others too much) with the lack of showing more sides of each characters instead of emphasizing mainly on their bravery and responsibility.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Not A Remake of Midway,"Before folks start comparing this film to the very good Charlton Heston version - note that this is not a remake of that movie.

It looks great and has fantastic air and sea scenes.Story-wise the film is a bit of a mess. The dialog is not the greatest, but it does not kill the film. The screenplay keeps the film a star or two above the pitiful Pearl Harbor, but it is too weak to propel this film into the Saving Private Ryan arena.Emmerick was not the right choice for director. He is mostly a visual director who does not have the storytelling talent needed to tell this historically important event properly. Nor is he known to pull the talent out of an actor to receive the strong performances that these historical figures needed. An example of that is the lead - it is a very weak performance that takes away from the film at times. Mandy Moore is also a non-essential role and her input was not inspiring in any way.

The history of the key battle in the Pacific Ocean or the Cheerful American war drama,"Historical drama. The picture that I would have voluntarily looked at a few years ago, when it was in cinemas (and even brought to our provincial one), but then I got a little interested in the history of the Second World War (or rather, I decided to refresh my memory), and then I just remembered this historical drama, shot by the famous director Roland Emmerich, who is known for staging disaster films, and then I decided to shoot a historical drama about the key battle in the Pacific. I decided not to pass by, but to look - and in the end I was not disappointed. Moreover, the picture could even pleasantly surprise and please me, and here's my brief opinion - a cheerful American war drama. There were not only pros, but also cons in the picture, so I finish with this introduction and get to the point.So, the pros:
1. Scenario - if you do not take the stupidity and outright nonsense from the beginning, then in general the script leaves a good impression, because it tells the story of several American military against the background of the outbreak of war between the United States and the Japanese Empire in the Pacific Theater of World War II. At the same time, we are shown the opposite side, especially focusing on the most respected and most talented and famous Japanese admiral - Isoroku Yamamoto. The personalities of the characters of the picture are revealed, which are written off from real people, and the actors were picked up extremely successfully. The finale is predictable for historical dramas, so it is visible to the naked eye almost from the finale (unless of course you know the story, then you will like to look at an excellent visual demonstration of these events). A variant of the script with several characters worked here as it should, and not as it was in Nolan's much-vaunted Dunkirk art house.2. Historical events - the Japanese attack on the United States on December 7, 1941 at Pearl Harbor, the Doolittle Raid on April 18, 1942, the battles in the Coral Sea in May 1942, and it all ends with a key event - the battle for Midway Atoll from June 4 to June 7, 1942, as a result of which the American fleet was able to destroy the main striking power of the Japanese fleet - four aircraft carriers, as a result of which Japan lost the opportunity for further expansion in the Pacific Ocean, and the Americans got time to rest and create new ships, which in the future will lead them to victory over Japan (although even here the stripes did not do without the Soviet Union, which defeated the Kwantung Army in Manchuria and liberated Korea and the Kuriles with Sakhalin in August 1945). In a small scene we will even hear the famous ""Tokyo Rose"". All these events as a whole are shown from a historical point of view correctly, and even the scale is present. Moreover, these events are shown from different points of view, except for the Doolittle raid (when American bombers bombed Tokyo, they were clearly inspired by the Soviet bombing of Berlin in 1941). Therefore, history lovers have something to see here.3. The lack of inflated patriotism and overwhelming pathos - I was afraid that all of the above would gush out of every frame here, just like in Bey's Pearl Harbor, with which this picture is compared (although they only have in common the raid on the base and the Doolittle raid, and also the pathetic phrase of Admiral Yamamoto). Therefore, the picture pleasantly surprised me with the fact that there is a minimum of pathos here, patriotism is shown only when it is needed. American sailors and pilots are shown as ordinary people, with their strengths and weaknesses. Japanese sailors and pilots also did not stay away. There is no off-scale number of striped flags here. Although something in the character of the Japanese was not disclosed, but more on that below.4. Picture - I understand that praising Hollywood cinema for a picture is a bad thing, but here I can't hold back. Air battles, battleships, pilot training, meetings of American and Japanese officers look excellent. The picture is juicy and allows the viewer to plunge into the thick of events. In 3D, this picture would look great, because the operator got excellent, because he picked out excellent angles.So, the cons:
1. Nonsense and stupidity at the beginning of the picture - here are the problems of screenwriter Wes Tuck, who does not understand the Japanese mentality of that time at all, because Japan before the defeat in World War II was a strong and proud empire (akin to Hitler's Germany), in which the ideas of modernity were fused with the samurai honor of feudalism, with a strong national tinge (which was akin to the Germans), because the Japanese also wanted to rule, but not the world, but Asia, primarily China and Philippines. It was after 1945 that Japan completely lost its independence and became a base for American planes and helicopters, and an obedient puppet in the hands of overseas masters. Therefore, there simply could not be a dialogue at the beginning of the picture. After all, you will not inform the potential enemy of your country of your own weaknesses, which can be pressed. Cars from the fifties are still flashing in the frame. Well, small shoals that you don't even want to pay attention to.2. Sterility - there is no soul in the picture. This is a Hollywood product completely cleaned of impurities, which of course does not look cheerful here, but I don't want to worry about the characters. Scenario turns are guessed instantly, in fact, they did not even show the cruelty of the Japanese in China (because a weak bombing and the exclamations of an American officer for revealing the topic do not count). Emmerich obviously forgot to put his soul. Well, at least the actors are trying, and even then not all.A little about the main characters:
1. Richard Best, played by Ed Skrein, is a lieutenant in the US carrier-based aviation. A real ""daredevil"" who infuriates his superiors with his insane antics on the verge of possibilities, but admires ordinary pilots. It was thanks to such guys that the Americans defeated the Japanese both in the Battle of Midway and in the further battles of the Pacific company. Ed looked pretty good in the role of a cheeky kid.2. Edwin Layton, played by Patrick Wilson, is a commander of naval intelligence, who, with his perseverance and professional skills, played a key role in the battle. A brave and hardworking officer who was well played by Patrick.3. Chester Nimitz, played by Woody Harrelson, is an admiral, commander of the US Pacific Fleet throughout World War II, who led his subordinate ships from Pearl Harbor to Tokyo. An experienced naval commander, with good organizational skills, who was well played by old Woody.It is difficult to call the picture an agitator, because they do not overdo it with American patriotism, because the Japanese are also shown as worthy opponents (forgetting about their inhuman cruelty). The campaign is just ""Pearl Harbor"" by Michael Bay, and here is a sterile historical and educational movie that is worth watching as part of cultural education.Although the box office failure of the picture in the USA surprised me, because according to the results of ""Midway"" I could not even beat off the budget completely (taking into account the money invested in advertising, which is not prescribed in the budget, and viewers can only know approximate figures). It's very strange, because they tell us on the box that Americans are one hundred percent patriots of their country, and here it is. A paradox, however.As a result, we have a cheerful historical drama, with an excellent picture, a good script, cheerful music, although with strong disadvantages, and good acting!My rating is 7 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!",7.0,Anonymous,History
Very enjoyable,Occasionally the critics get it wrong. I've seen the original Midway several times and this version focuses on different aspects of the same story. I found it very enjoyable and the actors/actresses did a fine job.,9.0,Anonymous,History

Oh no,"If you just like cheap war movies. Then go ahead.However if you view this as an actual movie, you'll lose your soul..The graphics are legit video game material.
There is no character development whatsoever.
It's basically scenes piled together into a waste of time.
I wouldn't recommend.. please watch a better movie like, saving private Ryan, full metal jacket, 1917, Dunkirk, platoon, zero dark thirty, or hurt locker. If you want to watch an actual war movie.

A good and historically accurate war movie,I was very skeptical going in to see this movie but I was very impressed by its accuracy. This movie is not for everyone that's evident but if you enjoy war movies that are faithful to history than it's definitely a good one to watch. It can be slow at parts and the CGI is also not the best but overall I was happy with my experience with the movie. I would recommend it to a friend who enjoys period pieces and war movies.,9.0,Anonymous,History
could have been a masterpiece,"Who doesn't like a war movie ? especially if it has great actors. the real midway battle and all the events that led to it were great no question about it, but there is something wrong in the movie itself . the movie really has some elements of poor movie making and i felt somehow disconnected in some scenes.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Silly garbage,"Note to self: I should stop watching movies.Seriously, there are so many bad films being made these days, and this is one of them. The effects are, pardon the joke, over-blown, very relevant historical facts are ignored (for example, USS Arizona sank upright, but in the film it rolled over), military discipline is sorely missing and aviation procedures are ignored all through the movie.There are two bright spots, though - the casting of Woody Harrelson as Chester Nimitz* and Dennis Quaid as William Halsey. They're pretty good doppelgängers for the admirals.Although the film does play straight with a lot of the historical facts, it ignores too many of them to make this a film worth watching if you want anything remotely like a serious account of the battle.*With the same hairpiece, Woody Harrelson could _easily_ play Spencer Tracy in a biopic.",3.0,Anonymous,History

Excellent movie,"The movie was historically accurate and an excellent portrayal. Midway and what led up to it is a crazy and convoluted number of events that this movie did an excellent job of portraying, but there's only so much detail you can cover. I'd advise reading up on it. But the movie was a fantastic portrayal with accuracy, acting, special effects, and the best large battle aerial effects to date.Let me address some of the ill informed and ridiculous opinions that others have given:1) The effects. I've never in my life have seen better large battle aerial effects in my life. I'm 52 and it's 2023. Name the one or any that are better. Just even one. I saw a comment otherwise and couldn't believe it.2) The movie is historically accurate. Very accurate. The true story behind it all, like most real life, are more incredible to believe than fiction.",10.0,Anonymous,History

So much better than Pearl Harbour.,This is a balanced and well depicted story of the events that finally brought the USA into WW2. A lot of the characters in the film are based on real people which gives it even more authenticity. The battle scenes are fairly spectactular and better than a lot of reviews on here suggest. This is one of the most believable War films of the last 20 years.,8.0,Anonymous,History
Real life heroes!,"I'll be honest, after Pearl Harbour, the idea of someone trying to create a modern film based on the battle of Midway filled me with trepidation. But Roland Emmerich can make big budget explosive films and they are entertaining.The film starts with the Japanese bombing Pearl Harbour, and though the sequence is fairly short, it is powerfully filmed with the true horrors of the moment taking centre stage. From then on the story focuses on a variety of real life heroes and the events leading up to the lesser known Battle of Midway, though I am pretty well read about World War II, this is one area I did not have a great deal of knowledge about, so this film gave me the impetus to read up on it.The cast is fantastic, Woody Harrelson and Dennis Quaid provide the senior leadership and this is the finest serious roles I have seen both of them in a while. Aaron Eckhart, Luke Evans and Patrick Wilson are also in their elements, playing leaders, pilots and intelligence officers and even Ed Skrein revels in his dare devil turned role model pilot. The real-life stories of the men they play are even more fascinating and we owe these men a great debt. Finally, there is Nick Jonas providing a lot of the heart of the movie.Unlike Pearl Harbour, the personal stories don't over shadow the narrative of World War II and do contribute to you being more invested in the characters, but once you realise these are real people, then I reckon you'll be invested anyway!
I watched this a few days ago and looking back on it, I enjoyed it more than I originally thought. If you're interested in this era of history and like explosions alongside great actors, then this is definitely worth a watch. A flying high 14/20 from me.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Not believable,"They got the history right overall, but they filled in with a lot of detail and personal events that made it unrealistic. CG was over the top; you wouldn't see that many planes and that much ordnance in the air all at once. Characters seem so unreal that I can't bring myself to care about them.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Not bad,"Not sure if this was a necessary remake, but not bad for an almost exact remake of the original 1976 Midway. Not sure if they used actual WWII footage like the original or if it was great special effects, but a couple of the carrier crash landings looked like actual WWII footage. I like some of the casting choices like Woody. I felt the original showed more of the strategy of both the US and the Japanese. Overall I liked and the modern flight scenes, but close the canopy! From a real pilots perspective, you'd freeze your ass off in reality!! lol. This applies to a lot of aviation movies since the invention of the movie camera. Tom Cruise didn't fly with his canopy open!!",7.0,Anonymous,History
U.S. Wins Midway Battle with Woody Harrelson as CinC Pacific Fleet!,"The Midway naval battle of 1942 has been called the greatest naval turning point since Trafalgar, and so director Emmerich and screenwriter Tooke decided to reprise the 1976 version with their own ""accurate"" version. If you want to see the Midway battle through the eyes and personalities of the pilots, then Midway '19 is your film; if you want to see the battle from the perspective of decision-making with incomplete information, i.e., the vantage point of command decision, then Midway '76 is the better film. While I salute the naval aviators for their heroism, the more interesting, and better, film for me is Midway '76 for its depiction of the dilemmas of command. Of course, I'm viewing Midway '76 with Charlton Heston and his son's role as somehow excised from the film!Screenwriter Tooke asserts that every element in Midway '19 is factually and sequentially correct, and I believe he's right; however, the strategic context of the film and what the film decides to emphasize are out of balance. Halsey's foray into the Marshall Islands was of limited importance (except for morale). Doolittle's raid, however, alarmed the Japanese but Coral Sea (a tactical victory for them but a strategic defeat) confirmed their self-confidence: thus the unwieldy Midway plan. We see the bellicose Japanese Army and the more reserved Japanese Navy, but the Navy was no less expansion-minded, just more pragmatic.My biggest complaint is how could the screenwriter give such an out-sized role to Admiral Halsey when he didn't even participate in the battle. I know Halsey is better known because of the press he cultivated (similar to MacArthur), but (soon to be) Admiral Spruance was the key commander who, using Nimitz's command to employ ""calculated risk,"" made the critical decision to launch his planes immediately upon the initial sighting of the Japanese carrier fleet even though the distance to the sighting was almost 200 miles and the attacking force could not be coordinated. The ensuing destruction of the carriers confirmed his immediate decision to ""turn the Enterprise into the wind."" Instead, the film gives Spruance a brief and bland characterization. One historian has described Halsey as a ""sailor's Admiral"" and the cool and cerebral Spruance as an ""Admiral's Admiral.""WW II, as reflected in Midway, will most likely be the only war when naval task forces with carriers as their striking forces never came in sight of each other during the battle. Here again I will favorably cite Midway '76 for its emphasis on the PBY reconnaissance patrols as being crucial to who locates the enemy first, while Midway '19 barely covers it in favor of more action-oriented air combat.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Historically accurate to tell the story,This movie is a great retelling of the events that transpired at the battle of midway. I get it's not 100% accurate but if you are looking for that go watch a documentary. The movie does use a lot of CGI but let's be honest to really capture the history and what really happened practical effects might not be the best ex. Dunkirk. I think this movie deserves more recognition for what it is and what it is trying to portray.,8.0,Anonymous,History

Its format is more of a hero movie than a war movie despite the subject.,"I found it a good action movie. It started off strong but some of script and acting was so on the nose all I could think of is Starship troopers (So I guess the ST parody is still relevant today). I think there is a place for these spins on historic events in movies, they just overdid it so it comes across a little as a fictional story.Midway was a little unfortunate to be released near 1917 so I've seen both movies with the other still fresh. One is based on a minor event where the movie manages to carry the weight of war and one is a major event that fails to in comparison.I find this really unfortunate, it was almost there for me. It certainly had it's moment's and it's only small parts throughout that jump the shark.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Why such a Dick?,"I recently developed an interest towards the naval battles of the Pacific War and was quite excited to see this movie. I didn't expect this to be any cinematic masterpiece, after all it's an American war movie, but was still left disappointed. Not for the reasons I expected though. The battles were actually pretty convincing and historically accurate, and there were many interesting small details that are usually ignored in a movie like this. Like a torpedo that fails to detonate (American torpedos were very unreliable at this time). My only tripe considering the battles was that in the opening battle in Pearl Harbor the Japanese fighters were shown traifing the battleships, as if that does any meaningful damage to a battleship. I would rather have watched how Japanese torpedo bombers, that did way more actual damage, attacked the battleships and how the surprised sailors tried to shoot then down.However, what ruined this movie for me was the bad casting and character depiction. Especially the main protagonist Richard Halsey ""Dick"" Best, who was portrayed as an unlikable loudmouth. I don't know what kind of person Dick Best was in real life, he might have been a nice guy, but if he really was such a dick, why didn't the movie director take some ""artistic freedoms"" to make him more likeable or use someone else as the main protagonist. It's not like the Battle of Midway was short on heroes to choose from. Minus 2 stars from this alone.In my opinion, there were also other bad casting choices. Woody Harrelson didn't impress as Chester W. Nimitz, Aaron Eckhart as Jimmy Doolittle didn't convince and Alexander Ludwig has no place to act as naval officer with his smooth whisper-like voice. Dennis Quad as William Halsey was an excellent choice though.",4.0,Anonymous,History
"Wow, no agenda in this one!","I didn't expect much with this and 3 minutes in a thought the script was a bit lame and cliched. But I stuck it out and I am so glad I did. This is basically a very compressed historically accurate account of the engagement at Midway. Nothing is deep and meaningful, there are no romantic subplots. No long winded speeches, just solid dialogue, decent performance and a shedload of action all crammed into 2 hours plus change. The CGI was pretty good and there were stages where I was tensing up as the planes were diving. But the overall best thing about this movie is it doesn't have a political agenda. They didn't cram a ton of historically inaccurate diversity into the ranks, it just got on with business and told an epic tale. Give it a chance and ignore the bad reviews. They are missing the point.",9.0,Anonymous,History

good but too ambitious,"I enjoyed this movie. Actually, I watched about 20 clips on YouTube before thinking, OK, I want to see it.Pros:* If you already know the general outlines of the story of Midway and the Pacific War, there's a lot of good story here.* Good acting.* Overall, it's a heroic tale worth knowing.Cons:* So ... many... characters. I can't imagine trying to follow all of this if you haven't at least read the Wikipedia page for Midway beforehand.* I also felt like Woody Harrelson and Dennis Quaid did good jobs, but they're too recognizable from other roles to play WW2 admirals.* CGI is a bit distracting because it's so over the top, but not enough to ruin things.Kind of related to not knowing the true story ... a lot of what really happened -- a lot of the coincidence, heroism, and completely unlikely things that make you feel as if the filmmakers are just adding things left and right -- actually did happen, just as portrayed.But if you don't know the story it could easily seem like overkill. (Remember in ""Pearl Harbor"" where Josh Harnett and Ben Affleck are in the Battle of Britain... and then Pearl Harbor... and then also on the Doolittle Raid?)Heck, even some of the characters' real names, from a 21st century point of view, seem made up. But, they're real.Anyway, a good movie, worth watching, but spend 10 minutes reading about the story beforehand if you don't know it.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Moderately entertaining recreation of one of WW2's most significant battles,"The pivotal battle of Midway gets the CGI/Roland Emmerich treatment in this epic war film. Despite the filmmakers' claims, the film contains numerous inaccuracies (see 'goofs' section) and, while the CGI and miniature work was very detailed, I never felt the images looked particularly 'real' (especially the numerous fires). The characters, while based on real people, never seemed to be more than Hollywood ciphers (not uncommon in the genre) and the script was a bit heavy on the melodrama, with a lot of artificial sounding 'banter' and contrived situations (the scene where Best's wife (Mandy Moore) scolds Layton about her husband's 'deserved' promotion seemed especially forced). The film covered too much ground (recreating the Pearl Harbor attack and the Doolittle raid on Tokyo - obviously relevant to the story but unnecessary to depict) at the expense of a more detailed depiction of the ebb and flow of the Midway confrontation. I was disappointed that so little time was given to the story of the catastrophic failure of the 'Devastator torpedo' bombers (of 41 launched, seven returned - most were shot down by Zeros on the approach and the few that got through dropped defective torpedoes before being destroyed). The film is typical of the director's oeuvre: loud, busy, unsubtle, predictable, and maybe a bit simplistic, but fast moving and entertaining. Despite some weaknesses, 'Midway' is well worth watching for anyone who enjoys 'war movies' (with all their attendant clichés) or 'seeing' military history unfold.",7.0,Anonymous,History
This Midway does justice to the 1976 Midway,I was skeptical of this version of Midway. I am big fan of the Charlton Heston/Henry Fonda Classic Midway. So I watched it first then watched the Emmerich 2019. I was very pleased. In fact in some ways this exceeds the original. The original has many strengths especially the cast is world class. But I find that th 2019 Midway has some details not in the 1976. I suggest that people watch this version even if you think the old one is better. Woody Harrelson does a competent job and the lead actors for Best and McClusky are good too. In the 1976 version there was no reference to the attack on the Marshall Islands. Nor did it mention the atrocities that the Japs hit on the Chinese people who helped DoLittle's raiders. And the CG (Computer Graphics) has come so far that it makes the movie very exciting in the Battle scenes.,9.0,Anonymous,History
Roland's dodgy CGI trademark,"Ok movie, big on the US patriotism and heroic deeds, fair enough, it was a time for heroes and patriots.

Midway between a bad movie and a really good movie.,"If like me you are a fan of the computer generated image (CGI) series Battle 360*, about the ww2 adventures of the USS Enterprise and its crew, or the series Dogfights, about ww2 aerial combat you are probably going to like watching this film just for the combat scenes and the CGI generated spectacle which is really impressive. If however you are someone who just likes good movies with a gripping story and characters that move you this film might be a disappointment.Since this is not the first film about the battle of Midway inevitably it needs to be compared to the 1976 film Midway. Of the two the 1976 film is the superior one in my opinion. It also gives a better understanding of the battle from a commanders point of view. This 2019 film focuses more on the experience in combat of a few naval aviators and their crew. This is done really well, but the story as a whole is rather thin especially if you take in to account that half of the story is taken up by the attack on Pearl Harbor and the Doolittle Raid.I thought the acting was a mixed bag. The stand out performance for me was Dennis Quaid in a small supporting role as William 'Bull' Halsey (who wasn't even involved in the battle of Midway!). It might have been the material he had to work with or the direction he got, but Ed Skrein, who plays the lead role, was a bit too cliché over the top maverick cowboy for my taste. It didn't really convince in a cardboard sort of way and made him unlikeable to the point you were almost rooting for the Japanese. The words character and development are best not mentioned in the same sentence as this film.Compared to the 2001 film Pearl Harbor, which is absolutely awful on every level, this film is a decent entertaining movie, but only one I would recommend for people who like war movies.",6.0,Anonymous,History
