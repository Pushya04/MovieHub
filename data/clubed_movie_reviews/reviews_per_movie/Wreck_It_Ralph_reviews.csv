"A lot better than expected, and made for gamers","Side note: The animated short Paper Man was very good. The animation was a unique blend of CGI but made to look like hand drawn animation. The only slight issue I had with it is that the short got crazy at the end and became unbelievable. Still cute.Being a gamer, I decided to go to this movie. I knew the movie was going to be good, but I didn't expect it to be really good. The action, humor, voice-acting, plot, and animation are all great. Since this movie is aimed towards gamers, I feel like a lot of the cameos and jokes are going to fly over most people's heads, such as ""All your base are belong to us"" written on a subway wall or ""Leroy Jenkins was here"". Thankfully, the movie doesn't rely on cameos to be successful.The animation in Wreck-It Ralph is very beautiful, and is great at expressing the video game world. I did not see it in 3D, but just from watching it in 2D I can tell that this movie would look amazing in 3D. The animators did really good in this movie because each video game world looks vastly different from another. Each world feels like an actual video game that I've played. If there is one problem that I can pick out in this movie (and many others have noted this as well) is that the plot focuses on the Sugar Rush world a bit too much. Most of the other worlds are revealed at the beginning mainly for the sake of reference, with only a few actually being important.The humor in Wreck-It Ralph is good because it hits a very large audience. A lot of the cameos and jokes are related to video games but there are also a lot of movie references as well, puns, slapstick jokes, and some crude humor. Some people complained at the crude humor but honestly it didn't bother me because it was coming from a character who looks like she is five, so it actually made sense.The interesting thing about Wreck-It Ralph's plot is that it has very little to do with an external conflict, but more with an internal one (which is a pun in itself because they are inside of video games). There is a main bad guy, and a huge disaster, and all of these other conflicts but these elements are back seat to the character development. I thought it was neat since most animated movies do the opposite. The voices for all of the characters were really well done. There weren't any annoying characters which adds to the movie. Another nice thing about the plot is that main bad guy is not revealed until the very end of the movie which focuses the plot on the characters, not the action or the villain.Overall a really great movie. Spectacular animation, great voice work, emotional and even touching at times, and overall humorous. While the Sugar Rush world might get slightly stale after awhile, it is still excellent movie. Gamers, this goes to you, WATCH THIS MOVIE!",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"A wonderful, nostalgic, and artful cinematic experience~","It's all fun and games at Litwak's Fun Center, until someone gets hurt. While this cliché'd line seems to reflect the simple plot in most movies (while the moral outcome does, too), the setting makes Wreck-it Ralph a wonderful, refreshing, and unique pleasure. Inside a family arcade, all the game characters (both old and new) are real, and travel among the other games when the doors have locked. Ralph, from Fix-it Felix Jr., desperately wished to be a good guy, and be rewarded, so he sets off in search of a medal. By doing this, he sets off a chain of events that puts multiple games at risk, and unveils a hidden threat.Disney has made this film equally accessible by both parents and children, and I find that wondrous. At times, Vanellope sounded quite mature, and at others, just like a tod. Soon, kids will squeal in excitement when they find a Fix-it Felix Jr. game, along with other last-gen arcade delights. In this way, the film has rendered itself timeless, if only in that small way. Although it doesn't feature many of the games themselves, you are able to see many characters, including retired ones.Being inside a game world gave the artists a great deal of freedom, but they didn't waste it. At every new turn, another extremely creative point would grab your attention, and I'm sure I missed many (which would enhance a second viewing). Another big enhancement is the 3D atmosphere. I doubted I would ever say this, but I urge you to see this in 3D, or turn around and go home. Because of all the pixel-related artwork, and 3D modeling, it is natural to have such a dimension added on. It's the perfect film to have it for!Now, for all the extra material surrounding the movie. Similar to Pixar, Disney has included an animated short right before, called ""The Paperman"". It doesn't feature any voice acting, but it's hilarious, and very well-made. I am sure you'll enjoy it. Second, the end credits are worth watching through, but not because there's an extra scene (there isn't one). It's only worth it for the visuals during the credits themselves, in 3D.In conclusion, Wreck-it Ralph is family-safe, and highly enjoyable. See it in 3D as soon as you can!",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Even better than I hoped....,"Got to see an advances screening of Wreck-it Ralph today. I had been waiting for at least a year for this film and it did not disappoint.I am a hardcore Disney fanboy and was before I even played my first video game. But I have to be honest, sometimes Disney doesn't get it. They see something is trending and an instant money maker and jump head first even if they don't understand the topic they're tackling.So it does make you wonder if they could really do justice to a film dedicated to something they really don't excel in. Video games are not Disney's strong suit(except for the rare cases like Kingdom Hearts, which really only succeeds, because they have little to nothing to do with the production). Trust me I've played enough cheap marketing/movie tie in/ buy it for your kid because of the characters on the box Disney games to know what I'm talking about.But Wreck-it Ralph nailed it. Start to Finish it is a love letter to gaming, made by people who understand games(and I highly suspect John Lasseter's role as Executive Producer greatly contributed to it's excellence).It really reminded me of why we love games. It's not the technology or the graphics or the marketing hype. It's what they make us feel. The broad range of emotions they extract from us as we immerse ourselves in their world. The joy of victory, the stinging pain of loss, laughter and even tears. I felt all of those in this movie.The world has become an ugly place and personally, my faith is what gets me through. But when you experience a game or a movie that takes you to an imaginative world where anything is possible, things start to seem a little brighter. Those stacks of paperwork you're facing seem smaller. The grisly news headlines get a little further away. That's what art and beauty do. They heal; help us see things in a better light. And I thank God for them.I didn't expect for the movie to get me waxing philosophical, but that's the kind of hairpin I am.Side notes: I was a little disappointed that they lingered SO long in one environment and I, frankly, find the crude humor tiresome. I thought the 3D was excellent, providing a nice immersive depth and texture without ever seeming gimicky( and I'm not a die hard 3D fan). Also, be sure to get there in time for the short at the beginning, Paper Man. Reminded me of classic Disney animated shorts, and that is not a bad thing.A few weeks ago I was leaving California Adventure Park and overheard a little boy talking to his father about Wreck-it Ralph. With the wide eyed enthusiasm of youth he said to his father, ""It's a movie about video games....who doesn't like that?"" Well said, kid, well said.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Fantastic!,"I was supposed to be be seeing either Flight or Argo today, but to my disappointment I missed both showtimes, and I was in a tight time frame where I could see anything. So my friend really convinced me to check this one out. Boy, what a great time it was.Wreck-It Ralph is really wonderfully created. Its visual design is brilliant and its action pieces pretty amazing. The world it builds, and all of the little details from various video games, is pretty wonderful to look at and experience. Even some characters move in the precise way they actually do in video games. But what makes this gloriously colorful spectacle of a world work is the screenplay. The jokes hit all the right places, the characters are all lively and written with skill that goes beyond what we have come to expect from a simple kids' film like this. The few commercials and trailers I saw had been sure to let audiences know just how ""pretty"" this film looked, but what makes it a truly great film is that it has a great story and great dialogue to back up the visuals. The voice performances are pretty incredible, and perhaps because I recognized such people like Reily, Silverman, McBrayer, and Lynch, but even others did wonders with their characters.Overall, the film follows a clear pattern and formula for kids, but the real surprise is that none of it made me roll my eyes or cringe. It's incredibly entertaining and enjoyable for anyone. Pretty much everything is done in a very respectable manner, and the film hits greatness in the writing, direction, voice performances, and visual design. The only real flaw in it that I gathered was the inclusion of a Rihanna song, which really took me out of the world the film created and kinda put a plaster on it from pop culture. Or maybe it's because I hate the song... Still, this is another truly great animated film that does stand out from others this year in its own way, and one that's admirable and satisfying in all the best ways. I loved it. Highly recommended.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Even better than I'd hoped,"Let me start by saying this: I am the ideal demographic for this movie. I am in my early/mid 30s, I grew up with videos games starting with the ColecoVision 30 years ago, which is, in the movie, when Wreck-It Ralph was released. I still play games. I have a four-year-old son who plays games. He knows who Pac-Man, Zangief and Sonic are, and you can bet that on top of that I know who Sheng Long, Tapper, Q*Bert and Burger Time are.That's what makes me nervous about blanketly recommending this movie to everyone...not just that I'm obviously going to catch more references, in-jokes and cameos than the average movie goer, but that I'm going to recognize the archetypes they're playing off of and the mechanics they're referencing as the stories progresses.It feels a bit like Mallrats, in that I'm so ideally in the target demographic for the movie's release that I'm not sure I can accurately gauge how it will be received by people outside of that demographic.That said, I don't think you need to be a video game fan to enjoy this movie. It's a very well crafted movie with characters that are more Pixar than Disney. I was concerned that this was a ""Disney"" movie as I haven't seen a 3D CG ""Disney"" movie that can hold a candle to the Pixar and Dreamworks hits that I'm a huge fan of. And yet, for me, this movie was better than recent Pixar movies and better than Dreamworks movies, with characters and a story that felt worthy of of the Pixar name.I even greatly enjoyed the animated short at the beginning. Again, something I would expect more from a Pixar film than a Disney film. The whole theater experience for this film was a delight, all the way through to the very, very brief bonus scene at the end of a credits, which is something you really, really need to be a gaming nerd to get. (Gamers who have seen The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters will definitely get it.) I went into this film with high hopes and expectations, and I was blown away. My wife, who is not a gamer at all, enjoyed the film, and when my four-year-old son was asked by her what his favorite part was, he replied, ""Um... Every part! I liked the whole movie!"" That he was able to talk to her and I in great detail about the plot and characters while I was able to appreciate the whole film to the level I did as an adult speaks volumes to me about how well this story was told.If you played in arcades in the 1980s, if the games Q*Bert, Burgertime, Pac-Man, Street Fighter II and Sonic all mean something to you: You're enough of a gamer to appreciate all the references. If you have a youngster who's played video games, they're enough of a gamer to get the movie. And even if you aren't, while you may not relate to the subject matter the way I did, you're still in for an enjoyable story, with great characters, masterfully told.Highly recommended, and a 10 out of 10 for me, as I expect this will be on both my son's and my short list of favorite movies for years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Best animated film of 2012? Absolutely!,"I think 2012 has been a very good, even great, year for animation in that I don't think I have seen an animated film I've disliked. Wreck It Ralph for me was the best animated film from 2012(although it only came out yesterday in the UK I still class it as a 2012 film), tying with Tangled as the best Disney has done since The Hunchback of Notre Dame. It has something for children and adults alike, and I don't think you have to be a video game fan to like it(I'm not exactly, more of Disney myself, but am very familiar with them through my brother). The animation is wonderful, the characters move with no problem at all, the colours look gorgeous and the backgrounds are detailed, very like the very best of Pixar actually. The music, right from the tempos, rhythms, melodies, chord progressions and instrumentation, is full of energy and the songs are incredibly catchy. The writing is a perfect blend of humour and heart, the film is often hilarious and witty as well as heartfelt and touching in equal measures and the story is fast-paced and much more original than you'd think complete with energetic-but not too frantic- action. I like the Be Youself message, it is an important one and I personally didn't think it was heavy-handed. And of course any video game fan will love spotting the video game characters and references, there's plenty of them and all are colourfully evoked. I found it very easy to relate to Ralph, Fix-it Felix Jr is an amusing character and Vanellope is cute without being annoying or mawkish. The voice work is terrific, with the standout being the gruff vulnerability that John C Reilly brings to Ralph. In conclusion, a wonderful film and the best animated film of the year. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"""Monsters Inc."" Set In a Video Game World","I did not really plan to watch ""Wreck It Ralph"" at all because I do not really like the recent Disney output. I am unfamiliar with the characters and the title and poster did not look attractive to me. However, with consistently good word-of-mouth reviews, I felt I had to give it a shot. And yes, ""Wreck It Ralph"" deserves its good reputation, and I am glad I got to see it.""Wreck It Ralph"" is the brutish gorilla-of-a-man villain of a arcade video game called ""Fix It Felix"". After thirty years of being thrown off the side of the building, Ralph feels he wanted to be the hero for a change. So he ventures outside his game to neighboring combat game ""Hero's Duty"" to earn his very own medal (as he sees Felix get a medal after each game).When he does get his medal, Ralph accidentally triggers a virus which attacks him and brings him into the Technicolor world of the racing game ""Sugar Rush"". There he meets the cute little glitch Vanellope who earnestly wants to join and win a race, but is not allowed to because of her imperfections. Can Ralph help Vanellope achieve her dream, save his video arcade world from viral destruction and be a real hero?While everything in ""Wreck It Ralph"" seemed new and original, I could not help but feel the spirit of ""Monsters Inc."" all throughout the film. It had the same basic story of a lonely but despised ""bad"" guy who does good and becomes a hero for a change. Even the interconnected world behind the video arcade (where all the characters had a life after the arcade closes for the night) is reminiscent of the labyrinthine world behind the closet doors in ""Monsters Inc.""Overall though, ""Wreck It Ralph"" remains to be fun and happy, with just the right dose of drama and action here and there to entertain viewers of all ages. The artwork of the characters and the settings is very colorful and visually arresting. This is definitely a contender for best animated feature film of the year.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
BRILLIANT! The best animated film of the year!,"Disney has made some really good animated movies, but they had never done a lot of movies that are as bright and original as Wreck-it Ralph, the new animated film from Disney. The movie centers on Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly), the villain in the ""Fix-it Felix"" arcade game, who decides to become a hero. Because he doesn't like being a bad guy, he goes into some of the video games in order to learn what it's like to become a good guy. He also befriends a character known as Vanellope von Schweetz (voiced by Sarah Silverman) from a candy-coated racing game called ""Sugar Rush"". When Ralph accidentally unleashes a threat in the arcade, he tries his best to save the day and become a true hero.I had extremely high expectations for this movie. I had the feeling that this will turn out to be an excellent animated film. I thought the premise to this sounded really cool and clever – a love letter to video games. I really love the voice cast.So, did Wreck-it Ralph met my expectations? Absolutely! This was such a fun animated movie for all ages, and better than Disney/PIXAR's Brave (which was also very good).John C. Reilly delivered a strong performance as the title character, who wants to make a change in his life, achieve it, and become what he wants to be. That's what a great movie character is about. Sarah Silverman provides most of the movie's funny moments as one of the ""Sugar Rush"" characters who Ralph befriends, and is a ""glitch"" (a character who faults the game). She tries to get Ralph for help to become a racer once again. Jack McBrayer (from the hit-show, 30 Rock) has an amusing supporting role as Fix-it Felix, the main hero in the ""Fix-it Felix"" arcade game, who sets out to find Ralph and get him back to where he belongs. Jane Lynch does a great job playing the main character in a first-person shooter game known as ""Hero's Duty"", who tries to find Ralph, alongside Felix.I didn't see the movie in 3D; which I must say it does look pretty darn good in 3D, but I decided to stick with the 2D because of the sharp, pristine screen.The animation is simply wonderful; the bright colors, the set-ups, the environments, the characters all look fantastic. At times, the movie is very gorgeous to look at on the big screen.The characters in this were likable and funny. It was awesome to see some video game characters making cameos (like Bowser, Pac-Man, Sonic, etc.). The story to the movie is well-thought out and genuinely clever. It's always nice to see something new to the table. I really liked the themes to the movie: What does it mean to be a true hero? How can the main character's goal become a success? And so forth.Generally, movies from Disney and/or PIXAR give a lot heart into their stories, which makes the tone of the movie become very sweet. Wreck-it Ralph has enough heart to make it that way. From start to finish, this movie is a lot of fun, and when families bring their kids to see this movie, they're going to fall in love with it.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Fresh Story full of Familiar Flavor, Wreck-It Ralph is nostalgically entertaining","Wreck-it Ralph is Hollywood's latest foray in to the subculture world of gaming---a world that Hollywood essentially knows nothing about, with examples I refuse to mention so I don't have the sensation of throwing up. Except this time its Disney turning on the nostalgia while delivering a fresh story that involves a mixing of classic-style arcade games with the new-school arcade hits that we currently see. So what we have is a pure gamer movie, right?Not quite. It is not a gamer's movie, it is really an animated movie with many, many nods to the world of arcade and console gaming. There is a major difference. You don't have the pacing, style, mood, and tone of a video game here unlike the visually stimulating whirlwind of a trip we experienced in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. Instead you have a movie with a major Disney touch and essentially becoming the modern-day version of Who Framed Roger Rabbit---a new cast of characters being joined by dozens of cameos from old-school favorites.Don't let this statement deter you, just let it allow you to hover your mind around the fact that the cameos you saw in the trailer was not a sample, it was a display of the entire menu. Luckily for this movie, the cast of characters featured are very likable, have their moments to shine, and do propel the movie forward when the plot (and amount of references) gets stuck in the mud. From the lovable baddie Wreck-It Ralph to the adorably filthy and sarcastic Vannelope (brilliantly executed by Sarah Silverman, an underrated comedic gem), you will feel for the characters much like when you immerse yourself in a gigantic video game. You will root for the two as they both fight for a place in gaming society, in a world that mistreats the outcasts, gaming villains, and anything too retro.In a sort of ironic twist, Disney and Nintendo (the current gaming leader) are very alike in mannerisms, and also very similar in how their audience reach prevents them from fulfilling their true potential. With Nintendo they aim to remain looking hardcore while attempting to reach out into the mainstream. With Wreck-It Ralph, it was a kids movie full of sight and verbal gags that will giggle the children and tweens while severely pushing heavy and subtle gaming references to the 80s, 90s, and gamers of today even. There is a Leroy Jenkins reference for crying out loud. Surely everyone gets their spoonful of fun, but it prevents the movie from truly pushing towards something edgy, something more.But what they do deliver, is a delightful movie that is chock full of nostalgia and originality. This awkward mix works for the company that saved the gaming industry, and works for the film that celebrates it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
By far one of their greatest work in quite some time,"I have to say that I was a bit surprised to see how well this was thought out, the director and the animators put their hearts and souls into making this movie with their special effects and amazing plot line laced with funny humor for both ages (young with the new-gen gaming and the old with retro-gaming). But not only is it funny, but very well thought out and well played.The characters were very well thought out and planned to show how it would be if a old-styled video game character would do in the after-hours when no one was around, they opened the door to a untapped imagination that blew me away. The originality behind the video game characters brings the term nostalgic to a whole new level.They also did an amazing job with the little girl named Vanellope and how her story unfolded, with surprising twists and turns to keep things rather interesting. Not only did they did a great job on the plot but also on the aesthetics of visual effects and gestures as well; Vanellope's character really blossomed because of this (as well as the other characters too).Ralph is one of those characters that you kinda hate being around with and shows that off by his enormous size (and his ape-like hands), he's a bad guy by code but he shows that when there's a will there's a way and Ralph eventually figures it out sprinkled with laughs along his crazy journey to save the day.An amazing job on the visuals, the story line, the character development, the overall plot, and most of all is how they managed to weave all these threads together into a solid movie for everyone. One of Disney's greatest works to be produced in a rather long time and really worth seeing again and again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Wreck-It Ralph is a familiar story for children, but it's still a colorful adventure film.","Wreck-It Ralph is a film for children though even adults will enjoy it because of its smart humor and clever references to the arcade. The story is simple, with Wreck-It Ralph representing adults with a mid-life crisis and Vanellope von Schweetz representing children outside of the pack. The film starts slow but it builds to a thrilling ending which can easily compel viewers to see it again. The influence of Japanese animation on the story and the animation is obvious. One of the songs on the soundtrack is Sugar Rush by the Japanese girl group AKB48. Another nice tune in the film is When Can I See You Again? by Owl City. An excellent voice cast was assembled to bring the likable characters to life, including John C. Reilly, Sarah Silverman, Jack McBrayer, Jane Lynch and Alan Tudyk. Wreck-It Ralph was produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios and not by Pixar. It doesn't reach the level of excellence of Pixar's best releases but it's still better than Pixar's worst, and even Pixar's worst are quite good. In conclusion Wreck-It Ralph, by director Rich Moore, is a good piece of entertainment, however I have to mention that it doesn't make good use of 3D. It's the 52nd animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series. I recommend seeing it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

"An arcade version of ""Toy Story"" (1995)","Disney are amazing. Over the past 80 or so years they have brought us endless classics and memorable characters and stories. But when they break away from their traditional fairy tales or from their traditional cel-animation (eg. ""Meet the Robinsons"" (2007) and ""Bold"" (2008)) they aren't as beloved as a Pixar CGI animation is. In my opinion ""Wreck-It Ralph"" follows the patters of the two films mentioned above, so I was hoping that Disney could make a really enjoyable CGI animation solo. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed ""Meet The Robinsons"" and ""Bolt"" but they didn't live up to the likes of ""Aladdin"" (1992, ""The Little Mermaid"" (1989), ""Tarzan"" (1999) etc. However, with ""Wreck-It Ralph"" they have produced one of their best solo CGI animation to date.This film reminded me of an arcade version of ""Toy Story"" (1995) which is a compliment. It was sheer genius how they translated an arcade gaming world into a film world, and how the arcade gaming characters would occupy themselves after playing hours. Also how the depicted the good and bad characters was really interesting and enjoyable to watch. Disney allows us to feel sympathy for the villain which is interesting, because as it is mentioned in the film, the ""bad guy"" is just a label, it doesn't make them bad people. It's hard to explain without giving any spoilers, but I can say the message of the film is really ironic and clever how they used a traditional message and altered it in a unique way.The story is decent enough. Bad guy wanting to break out of the mould and be the hero and win a medal for once. But his encounter with Vanellope von Schweetz is really special. Her character is so adorable and is very easy to relate to. It kept you watching because it is a unique film so you didn't know entirely where the film was heading, and it came with many thrills and surprises.Despite it's interesting and enjoyable characters, I wish they did feature more of Sonic and characters from his universe. I didn't know the majority of the gaming characters so I was really excited when seeing Sonic on the posters, so was a little saddened at the 1% you see of him within the film, but it didn't hinder the enjoyment of the film. Also, despite the story being really unique and enjoyable, I wish they included more arcade gaming worlds. This is just a minuscule criticism.Overall, an enjoyable family film with a fresh story and fun characters.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Virtual Joys,"Wreck-It Ralph imagines a world where arcade game characters have their own lives. It's like a video game version of Toy Story and Who Framed Roger Rabbit, but this one is much more appealing to the viewers. As expected, it has an endless amount of enjoyment, a big scale of adventure, and really fun characters. The filmmakers poured their love of these games to the film thus made this a wonderful nostalgic delight.The story doesn't sound quite fresh at some point, especially for an animated film, but the main attraction here is the theme. It sets in a magnificent arcade world. It's fun when it captures the prominent video game mannerism like the freezy movements in retro games, an out of control game character walking against the wall in 3D games, and the glitching. It's easy to know what the central games are inspired from. Many would root for the cameos of iconic game characters and each of their appearance are splendid. The movie is filled with action set pieces that are undeniably exciting. By its grand scale and references, the experience is gloriously extraordinary.Another charms of the film is the characters. We don't usually see films with well developed characters in blockbusters these days but this one has plenty of it. They all have their own pathos, but in a comical way. And the voice performances were great. John C. Reily gives Ralph an acceptably nice personality. Sarah Silverman makes Vanellope adorable enough. Jack McBrayer is quite charming as the always positive Fix-It Felix Jr. and Alan Tudyk is delightful as the goofy King Candy.The animation is wonderful. Like what I said, they really capture the elements of every video game. The game ""Sugar Rush"" has the most colorful(and product placed) visuals of the film. The rest is thoroughly inspired. 3D is usually unnecessary but here is just fine. It's kind of worth it by its large adventures. There is no scene after the credits but it's better to stay during it to listen to the theme songs of ""Sugar Rush"" and ""Fix-It Felix Jr."".There isn't much groundbreaking about Wreck-It Ralph but what makes this special is its tribute to the classic video games. It also serves an over the top fun and sweetness(no Sugar Rush pun intended). It's so fun, it's easy to ignore its little flaws. There are some things that could have been better, but the film is already good enough. To those who love playing video-games will enjoy this a lot more. It's just full of life and nostalgia. Wreck-It Ralph is a great virtual ride!",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

If this movie were just a short of the first 20minutes then I would give it a solid 9/10.However after The starting 10-20min your put into a universe that feels like every other sub-par CGI animated film released in the last 6 years. Megamind, Happy Feet Two, Bolt.The movie devolves into an experience where you could care less about the movie or what is going on. Mind numbing action that has no real meaning or emotion behind it. Just a bunch of explosions and screams. You don't care about the characters and your just waiting for the movie to end.It's as if they made an abomination of a movie then realized how horrible it was and purchased rights from many IP's (Capcom, Konami) for the sole purpose of throwing into their trailers and advertisements but have nothing to do with the story line or past the 20 minute mark.It was clear that after the 20 minutes no one laughed at the poorly written script and no body was drawn into it. Looking around I just see people looking at their watches/phones waiting for the movie to end.This movie has to be the biggest bait and switch I've witnessed in my movie watching days.",4.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"""The selfish man is like a mangy dog chasing a cautionary tale"" (dialog)","OK OK I get it.This may not be the overall ""best"" animated film of all time but, now that I have seen it six or seven times, I think it is not only ONE OF THE BEST but also it excels at the following:* best use of video games as a metaphor for an action story.* best atmosphere -- just when you think you are comfortable with the interior of one game, they introduce another. It is like a 3D film without the actual need for the glasses.* best matchup of voice actor and personality -- every animated film, now, in the past, and yet to come, strives for this. Many die-hard fans will say that Ellen Degeneres as a fish nailed it. Well, I don't think so. The voice acting of Sarah Silverman matched with the animated character (which I swear seems to be just Sarah herself when she was maybe 5 or 6 years old) is the most perfect meshing of the two I have seen.The story, the acting, the direction, all perfect -- this is an amazing movie that really did not get the attention it deserved.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A New Classic,"The Short: Wreck-It Ralph is a classic. From the slick animation, the great sense of humor, nostalgia inducing references and cameos, and the surprisingly adept and emotional story, Disney's Wreck-it Ralph is the best animated comedy since Tangled, and one of Disney's best animated films ever crafted.Street Fighter, Pac-Man, Q-bert; widely known and considered classic games. But a ""new challenger has entered the ring"" in the form of old school, Donkey Kong inspired retro arcade game, Wreck-it Ralph. Follow the misadventures of Wreck-it Ralph, voiced by John C. Reilly, as he attempts to become a hero by jumping though various video games. I don't want to spoil any of the plot, but it is incredibly well told and is quite surprising in the end. It has that classic Disney emotion, but with a most unique ""video game-y"" twist. In the end, Wreck-it Ralph teaches some great lessons, but it is also neither mundane nor juvenile, and that's why it's a winner.The cast here couldn't fit the characters better. John C. Reilly as the big guy Wreck-it Ralph, Sarah Silverman as the spirited and surprisingly funny Vanellope von Schweetz, Jane Lynch as the stoic and hilarious Sergeant Calhoun, and Jack McBrayer as the lovable and yet again laugh- out-loud Fix-it Felix Junior. The movie is absolutely hilarious; the performances from all of the actors fit their roles perfectly and couldn't be funnier. They couldn't have picked a better voice cast, honestly to goodness.The animation continues the high pedigree that Disney has become famous for. Its bright and lively action is wonderful to watch, and combined with great facial animations make for a great and emotional experience. But the winner here is the way that they have adapted the old- school style of video game animation into the film itself. You'll know what I mean when you see the movie. It makes for a truly unique, one of a kind experience! Sony's 4K presentation is crisp and vibrant.The thing to understand though is that with its focus on video game cameos and references, don't worry! You don't have to have any knowledge of video games to understand or enjoy Wreck-it Ralph. The story and main characters are all part of the film's story and world. Rather than using the references as a crutch, they're used more as a springboard into new and unexplored fictional worlds.Granted, gamers of all ages are going to love the care and attention taken when putting in the huge amount of references, cameos, and little bits of easter eggs spritzed and scattered throughout Wreck-it Ralph, making for a truly nostalgic inducing experience.And those classic Disney trademarks, from great characters to a well told story, are all here and are much more than side attractions. The twist is great, the concepts are fresh, and the level of imagination at work revives my faith in the animated genre. There's still plenty left in this old dog after all.And so I have to end this review by asking, ""Are you tired of the same old washed up animated feature film? Feel like you're just too old for childish animated movies?"" Wreck-it Ralph is the perfect cure. And it's meant for that group of movie goers looking for something more than just another animated money pit. It's laugh out loud funny, exciting and fresh, incredibly inventive and gleefully unique at every turn.It's a classic no doubt, and Wreck-it Ralph will be one of those movies on my ""favorites"" shelf for decades to come. The true triumph? Wreck-it Ralph feels like that classic game that has been a part of my childhood ever since I can remember; the type of classic where you throw hundreds of quarters away and you honestly just don't care, because it is just that good.5/5 - Perfection; Stop reading and watch right now",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

There's no one I'd rather be than me,"Here is a warm, clever, and funny addition to Disney's animated canon. Wreck-It Ralph applies the general concept of Toy Story in a new and original way. The entire film is illuminated with familiar video game characters and little gamer jokes from invisible walls to jerkier, less developed side characters.The overarching Armageddon subplot could have been handled better since it has us nearly forgetting about it in an effort to focus on developing the main characters and their own interests. Ralph seems to be oblivious throughout the film about the fact that he pretty much threatens everyone's existence with his carelessness.But Vanellope! The highlight of the film. She is the most adorable little character, although it is a bit creepy that she's essentially a mini-me of Sarah Silverman. Nonetheless, if this movie has a single strong point, it's that Vanellope will find a way to win you over.The simple lesson of the film is conveyed well: grow to accept your identity.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A Solid Entry by Disney,"After a couple of years without a great, non Pixar, Disney animated movie, it seems like Disney is back on track. We first got Tangled and now this, Wreck-It Ralph. This movie was clearly made with young and old gamers alike in mind. There is a little something to like for everyone with this one.The most obvious thing this movie has going for it is the nostalgia. For anyone who has been gaming, there are little easter eggs and nods to some of gaming's greatest all throughout the movie. There is one scene in particular where Ralph is at a Villains Annonymous meeting and it was great seeing the others in attendance (I will let you see for yourself).I also enjoyed the fictional game worlds. Ralph was in three different game worlds, a ""Donkey Kong"" type game, a ""Call of Duty"" type game, and an arcade racing game. My personal favorite game world was the Call of Duty one. The soundtrack kicked in nicely and it was great to see Ralph frantically trying to survive. I did however think they spent too much time in the racing game ""Sugar Rush"". I know it was necessary for the plot points but I would have loved to see additional games (One can only hope for a sequel).Aside from all the spectacle, the movie had a great story with an interesting theme. We get to see Ralph grow as a person as at first he is selfish and disregards others feelings in order to get his medal. He later realizes that the medal doesn't mean as much as he thought. We also get to see how the characters from his home game go from shunning him to realizing they need him. Ralph was treated poorly and no one cared until they realized without him, there is no game for them to live in. You really get to see that everyone has value as well as the importance of teamwork.I don't think Wreck-It Ralph is on the same level as some Pixar movies but it should please gamers and anyone looking for a visually appealing animated movie with heart.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Perfect Mix of Disney and Pixar,"In 2006, when Disney bought Pixar and put John Lasseter in charge of its entire animation division, most of us expected great things. After 60- odd years of complete domination in the animated movie world, Disney had lost the magic, if you will, of Sleeping Beauty and The Lion King in the midst of a heap of mediocre features that just didn't measure up to the legacy the studio had created for itself. With Lasseter on board, though, multiple generations of Disney fans who had grown up on the virtues of Robin Hood and the like hoped that the man who had redefined the genre with Pixar would return the studio to its previous glory. In essence, we were hoping for Wreck-It Ralph.All Ralph (John C. Reilly) wants in life is to be appreciated. As the villain in an 80s arcade game known as ""Fix it Felix Jr."", Ralph's job (which he does quite well) is to inflict damage upon the Niceland apartment building so that Felix (Jack McBrayer) can fix the damage. For thirty years, the end of each night, when the arcade the game resides in closes up shop, sees Felix returning to the thankful residents of Niceland while Ralph is relegated to the dump. Eager for a change, Ralph sets off into the various realms of the other games in the arcade in search of a Hero's Medal which would, he believes, change his lot back home. But when he stumbled into the racing game ""Sugar Rush"", he is waylaid by an obnoxious misfit known as The Glitch (Sarah Silverman), and when their paths become tied through a series of wild events, Ralph begrudgingly agrees to assist The Glitch, though he has no idea what he's getting himself into.I have seen Wreck-It Ralph described as, ""Toy Story for video games"" and I believe that statement rings absolutely true. In a year in which Pixar's own feature (Brave) felt much more like a Disney movie than one that fit the standard Pixar model, it is fitting that the Disney film should have a decisive Pixarian feel to it. From the early moments, which include a gloriously scripted voice-over that would make Morgan Freeman jealous, Wreck-It Ralph establishes a link to the best of the Pixar universe and it never looks back. The concept itself is ingenious and deliciously outside the box, a truly original idea that opens up a thousand doorways through which to take the film. I imagine that, when advance notice of Wreck-It Ralph began circulating in Hollywood, many studio executives spent some time banging their respective heads against a wall or two, wondering why they didn't think of this. And yet the core value at the film's heart, the universal desire for acceptance, is incredibly simple and stands out as one of the reasons why the film excels. One of the keys to success in the Pixar universe is emotional relevance; they take common themes, struggles, and desires and illustrate them through lavish and meticulously crafted mediums, be they talking toys or a lonely robot. That quality courses through the veins of Wreck-It Ralph, creating a bond between the audience and a giant, buffoonish video game character, and making his journey seem all the more real in spite of the fact that it takes place within the code of an arcade game.The quality of Wreck-It Ralph, however, goes far beyond the original concept, something I was concerned about going in. It would have been easy for director Rich Moore and his creative team to focus too much on the overlying idea and forget to build the rest of the film up to the appropriate standard. Instead, it is clear that every detail of Wreck-It Ralph was given the proper attention. For one thing, it is a very intelligent film. Sure, you have the requisite ""duty"" jokes that will keep the kids (and possibly the adults sitting next to me who shall remain nameless) laughing but overall, many of the bits are geared toward an adult audience (though none of it crossed the line to become inappropriate for younger viewers, a quality I appreciated). There are also a ton of little details (you might even consider them Easter Eggs of a sort) that are geared specifically to the gaming population, all of which brought great approval from the audience. The voice work, too, is spectacular. Reilly is the perfect actor to bring Ralph to life and he brings a real sharpness to his role. In addition, Silverman, McBrayer, Jane Lynch, and Alan Tudyk do an excellent job in their respective roles and all of them blend together with their characters. This is a quality I greatly appreciate as I feel that too many animated films utilize their voice actors only to create familiarity with the audience instead of having them actually act. As in, ""Hey! That's Adam Sandler talking! Now I like this movie!"" I find this very distracting and annoying. Here, though, the actors lend both their voices and their talents to the cast and I think Wreck-It Ralph is much the better for this. I was especially impressed by Tudyk, whose voice was completely unrecognizable to me until the final credits rolled.Perhaps the most impressive feat Wreck-It Ralph pulls off comes in the form of keeping its narrative integrity and momentum together despite undergoing a fairly significant scene shift. Ralph's stay in ""Sugar Rush"" takes up a solid half (or more) of the film and that world is dramatically different from the film's initial setup. I was a bit concerned that this would result in a drop-off in interest/quality but instead the film just keeps on rolling. Wreck-It Ralph is a wonderfully fun, smart film that should keep a wide-ranging audience happy and instantly takes up residence amongst my favorite Disney films of all- time.Please check out my other reviews at thesoapboxoffice.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Time for a reality check,"Wreck-It Ralph is a very good movie, which I really enjoyed. I would put it right up there with Tangled and Cars and A Bugs Life.But it is no Toy Story or Who Framed Roger Rabbit, movies to which it is being mistakenly compared. Those movies were masterpieces. This is far from a masterpiece. It has the good fortune of being released in a year of good but flawed animated movies--The Lorax, Brave, Ice Age 4, Madagascar 3, ParaNorman, Frankenweenie, Hotel Transylvania...this is not a stellar movie slate. Release this movie in 2010 (the year of Toy Story 3, How to Train Your Dragon, Despicable Me and Tangled) and it would barely get noticed.Ralph's quest to get a medal seems arbitrary and artificial, especially when compared to Woody's quest to get back home. The amount of arbitrary rules in this movie is staggering and evidence of lazy writing. And the movie overall felt derivative--from its plot of a bad guy who turns good (Despicable Me, Megamind) to its characters like King Candy (the Mad Hatter from Alice) and Vanellope (Agnes from Despicable Me), to its twist at the end (Who Framed Roger Rabbit). Don't get me wrong--I really liked this movie, and I think it was the best animated movie of the year. But this year that's not saying much.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Friendship and true values are the background: simply wonderful!,"Hey, wait a minute there! How come no one has had the idea of bringing the fantasy universe of video games into the big screen? I do not remember anyone having done this before ... ah ... except, of course, by TRON. Coincidence or not, also produced by Disney. Many people do not know, but Disney was a pioneer in computer graphics in the film industry. And now, under the general direction of John Lasseter (Pixar former), Disney keeps the tradition on creating some of the most magical moments in animated films or even in films regarded as traditional. ""Tron Legacy"" was an example of this latest kind. Perhaps a misunderstood work , is one of those unforgettable movies , in every aspect, especially for those who like CG, games, great music, a dazzling visual and an engaging story. Another recent product, this time already connecting x Disney Pixar was ""John Carter."" Directed by excellent Andrew Stanton , this film was also misunderstood by the general public. Unfortunately, it was poorly worked by Disney marketing people and the general public did not understand the overall proposal. Well .. Now we have ""Wreck-it Ralph."" I must confess ... I cried while watching this movie. That's right! So even as I cried in ""Up!"" or ""Wall-e"". These works come from different teams, but all have the same background: poetry. The look of this film is stunning. Colors, details, the overall creativity... are all very touching. The references to the world of video games are priceless! And what about that cute little girl? Well, I would like to summarize this movie as ""magic"". It belongs to that realm of fantasy and delight of magic, that kind of magic that makes you leave the theater with a light spirit, and happy and relaxed. A bit like Toy Story 3, ""Wreck-it Ralph"" is about the recognition of each individual's position in the universe and, of course, about friendship. I recommend this movie. At least for those who still insist on dreaming on and on.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"When the arcade closes, the games come out and play...","While watching, I chuckled aloud in the theatre hall, already packed with kids, their parents, and accompanying couples enjoying themselves. But there is a fourth demographic this animated movie is aimed at - the video gamers - and I suspect that most of the audiences are/were gamers themselves at one point in their life. I know I was.Which was why I was pleasantly surprised at ""Wreck-it Ralph"", Disney's latest CG-animated film, and most certainly there will be more to come. It's an enjoyable treat for kids and adults alike, and if they were avid gamers, extremely nostalgic to see some of the mechanics and characteristics come into play here, if they manage to get past the cameos of other real game characters.When the arcade closes at night, the games and the characters come to life, interacting among one another. Ralph (appropriately and charmingly voiced by John C. Reilly) is the villain of the (fictional) classic game Fix-it Felix, Jr., and so desperately wishes to be beloved and respected as the hero Felix (Jack McBrayer, whose voice fits Felix to a T) is. When he gets rejected, he leaves his game, in one out of many creative ideas, to look for the sacred hero's medal.How the screenwriters used this familiar plot device (""Despicable Me"" and ""Megamind"" were two years away) and incorporate it into a series of fantastical and imaginative ideas is pure movie magic. They have created a living, breathing fantasy universe within the video-game realm. I can imagine the number of kids/video game fans screamingly excited at the mere thought of it, and it's brought to life vividly here. It's not everyday you see Bison and Zangief from Street Fighter, and the ghost from Pac-Man, discuss among each other ""Why Being Bad is Good"" in an Anonymous-style meeting.Ralph doesn't want any of it. And so he ""game-hops"", from a ""Halo""- styled sci-fi shoot-em up led by the spunky Sgt. Calhoun (Jane Lynch) to an anime-influenced, syrupy racing game where Ralph meets Vanellope, a feisty but adorable glitch (Sarah Silverman), who is banished by everyone in the game, especially King Candy (Alan Tudyk). One thing leads to another and before you know it, the fate of the arcade rests in the hands of Ralph when enemy bugs from the sci-fi game, which only knows how to consume and destroy, ends up invading the candy racing world.Sure, I've seen this story before. But this is a fresh, lively and colorful spin to it, thanks to writer/director Rich Moore. The visuals and animation are crisp and top-notch, and the styles of animation and various character designs pull you into the gaming universe even further. Even the difference in game generations is humorously poked at by a terrified Ralph in one scene. The music by Henry Jackman really helped to underscore the zany goings-on throughout the movie. Of course John Lasseter had to be involved. ""Toy Story"" in a video-game world. And it works.I really enjoyed this animated movie a lot more than I expected to. It was funny and exciting at times, it was bright and colorful, and it had a proper and cohesive story to fit the universe, something other video- game to movie adaptations had problems doing. It even has a likable and charming hero (yes) and some really fun supporting characters to boot. Both ""Megamind"" and ""Despicable Me"" tried, but this is the clear winner.Overall: 78%Another thing. Go early to see a very charming, classic-like short called ""Paperman"". The whole thing is in glorious black-and-white.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Wreck me Ralph, please!","Since the release of its very first trailer, a long time ago, Wreck it Ralph has always appeared as one of the most promising animated flicks of the year. Having seen the movie, I have changed my mind: It's not just one of the best animated movies, it's one of the best movies (or maybe the best) of the year.I don't like to make Disney/Pixar comparisons, but this time Disney has outdone itself. Compared to Brave (which was good enough), Wreck it Ralph is a very strong movie, based on a complex, fresh and original story involving the video games world. I think this is the first step in the process of creating an animated movie: to find a fresh, involving idea. Every small detail, every character seems to perfectly fit in this magical world behind one of the most diffused hobbies in the world. This is undoubtedly Disney at its best.In Wreck it Ralph there are not boring parts, you can laugh or be scared, be moved or even be thrilled but you will hardly yawn while watching this movie. During the projection, I literally burst out with laughters, as the movies presents many funny situations. It's a real pleasure to follow the story and to enjoy every small detail present in the movie.The characters are very 'toony' but at the same time they seem to be real and very believable. There are no clichés or stereotypes, everything is fruit of the ingenious minds working at Disney. For example, if you asked me 'who's your favorite character?' I couldn't answer because they're all great and funny. Ranging from Ralph to Vannelope, from Felix to King Candy, every character is perfectly portrayed.But Wreck it Ralph is not just a way to laugh and pass a couple of entertaining hours: it's far more than that. Not only the film is full of references to the video game world, but it contains lots of references to movies and modern world themes. It's even full of reflections upon life, in the typical Disney style.The icing on the cake is the ending. I will not spoil anything about it, I will just say that it's astonishing and very unpredictable. To put it in a funny way, I would say that it's one of the best thrillers I've seen this year!Finally, two words for the soundtrack. Henry Jackman ost is catching and enjoyable. In some cases, it's a mix between music and the sounds of old 8bit video games. In particular, I really appreciated the track 'Arcade Life' and 'Arcade Ending'. The end credits song, 'When can I see you again' by Owl city is also truly enjoyable.I think Wreck it Ralph is not just one of the best animated flicks of the year, but it's one of the best movies of 2012. Disney has outdone itself, I'm looking for other animated masterpieces like this one, fresh original and entertaining.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Fun for all ages,"Disney's newest movie, Wreck-It Ralph, a 101 minute film directed by Rich Monroe is a real thrill ride that will have you sitting on the edge of your seat. Movie attendees will watch John C. Reilly play the voice of protagonist Wreck-It Ralph, the bad guy in the arcade game ""Fix-It Felix Jr."" that just wants to be someone who is appreciated like the game's hero Felix. Also, Ralph goes through a lot of transformation, starting out as a bad guy just trying to be appreciated as a good guy and transforming into a genuinely caring, lovable nice guy. Another interesting part of the movie is the arcade that the movie is based in; it appeals to some of the older generation coming to watch the movie because of the childhood memories brought back by the arcade games they spent their time, and quarters, playing when they were younger.Significantly, the movie begins with Ralph(John C. Reilly) shown doing his job of getting angry and smashing a building in Niceland, the name of the land in ""Fix-It Felix Jr."", followed by the loved hero of the game, Fix-It Felix Jr. himself, coming and rebuilding the smashed windows of the apartment building with his magical hammer. Felix fixes the building all the way to the top and the Nicelanders go to the roof, and after throwing Wreck-It Ralph off and into the mud, they give him a metal and praise him for his helpfulness. Day after day this happens making Ralph an even angrier bad guy, causing him to dream about him becoming a hero, winning a metal, and becoming appreciated. One day, Ralph sees, from his home in the dump, a 30th anniversary party going on in the penthouse of the apartment building he destroys daily. This was the final straw of Ralph's willingness to continue on with his job without being thanked the slightest bit, so he goes into the building to crash the party. Against the pleas from the Nicelanders, Felix awkwardly lets Ralph into the party, but being the over-sized clumsy bad guy he is, he smashes the beautiful intricate cake made for Felix. Ralph is downright embarrassed and leaves the game in search of a medal to be appreciated.Additionally, Ralph changes a lot form the start to the finish of the movie. In the beginning, Ralph is an angry, misunderstood bad guy only interested in himself, but at the end he transforms to a kind, caring good guy that would sacrifice himself for others. Looking for a medal to in, Ralph finds the perfect opportunity in the game ""Hero's Duty,"" a first person shooter game where the objective is to kill evil ""cybugs,"" manages to wreak havoc in the game, but still win a metal. After winning the metal he takes an escape pod, loses control and crashes into a new game, ""Sugar Rush."" While in the process of crashing, he loses the metal to a young girl that he later learns is a glitch in the game. She uses the metal as a coin to enter a race but is banned from racing, due to her being a glitch. A deal is struck between Vanellope(Sarah Silverman), the girl, and Ralph in mutual benefit for both of them, Ralph gets a metal and Vanellope gets to race in the race. Ralph is reluctant and not very friendly with her, but over time grows more and more fond of her and even becoming best friends. By the end, Ralph completely changes from a bad guy to a loving kind good guy that would even be willing to sacrifice himself for others.Essentially, many people would enjoy this movie, but some may avoid seeing it since it is a G-rated Disney movie. Some may think that the plot is childish and not worth it to pay for and see. Another example of people not wanting to see it may be that moviegoers might think that the arcade game setting would be nerdy and wouldn't understand it. Finally, people could just think that better movies are out and just watch it on Netflix when it comes out.Moreover, another example of what makes this movie so great is the arcade setting. Many older people most likely remember playing the games portrayed in the movie that brought them entertainment and happiness. Games like PacMan, Donkey Kong, Tappers, a root beer bar tending game, and other games like Qbert and Final Fight. Although some of the people in the younger generation may not know what some of the old arcade games are, they were a great addition in the movie nevertheless.Overall, this movie is really exceptional, and may even be heartwarming to certain people. It excellently mixes action and a great story line. Disney produced a real winner with Wreck-It Ralph, and is definitely a must-see. Casting of the voices, plot, and animation are all good things about this movie, and is a great movie to see with your family. If you do choose to watch this excellent piece of cinematography, pay attention to the classic arcade games in the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A wonderful animated film,"I have only just got round to seeing 'Wreck-It Ralph' and I can safely say it is a film I will be watching again! It was such a great film, it is enjoyable for the whole family and is definitely one of the best animated films I have seen.The characters are all lovable in their own way and voiced very well. There is some good laughs along the way too which is good. I really loved the plot and how it was done, it was so clever. The animation all looked great, the soundtrack was great, the colours were wonderful and all the characters looked brilliant. It was really cool to see little cameos from characters from real life video games such as Pac-Man, Sonic and Bowser. This film should be enjoyable for everyone but avid gamers in particular will be able to relate to it more.Ralph is just a brilliant character who is known as a bad guy in his game 'Fix-it Felix', where Felix takes all the credit. Ralph just wants to be loved so he sets out to become a hero. All he has to do is sneak out of his game and into another to win a medal, it sounds simple but of course there is so much depth and meaning to it. He ultimately ends up causing a lot of trouble but with the help of his friends they manage to save the day. As is often the case with an animated film, there is plenty of heartwarming moments.I would highly recommend this film to anyone.

Full-Blown Video Game Nostalgia!,"When I first heard of this movie at a few film conventions/expos, it piqued my interest. When I did, I was dazzled and drooling in 80s/90s video game nostalgia when I saw several familiar video game characters of different companies cameo in of all places a Disney animated feature! Sonic, Paperboy, and even a few Street Fighter characters (I could go on forever about those...)The plot happened to be both intriguing and worth pondering over a few times. Why? Because the idea of an 80s video game ""bad guy"" called Ralph trying to redeem himself as a ""good"" guy sounds familiar from previous animated films. I mean, he can cross into any game he wants within a local arcade, trying to find a new perspective in life. Feels like ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" (the theme of different franchises crossing together and a somewhat similar subplot) meets ""Toy Story"" (characters that have a 'job' to amuse kids and are independent when no one is around).Upon Ralph's meeting of a young girl called Vanellope Von Schweetz in a kart-racing game titled 'Sugar Rush,' it brought out the true emotional tone of the entire film, in my opinion. The pint-sized, 9-year-old sure has a lot of spunk on being a great racer, but the 'brother-sister' relationship between her and Ralph seems to have developed into the big focus.As a small boy back in those glory days of gaming, 8-bit/16-bit games were my favorite past time. Now as an adult, it felt like reliving childhood all over again. These days, video games seems to be more of a guy's thing since there aren't many female gamers (which is why the creation of 'Sugar Rush' was included in the film's premise to balance that). The handful of video game character cameos don't intervene or overshadow the movie's premise. Ralph may not tread millions of miles away from Shrek (as they are characters that are usually feared or resented by others, but deep down they are misunderstood figures that only want to be accepted well in society), but Ralph is a likable big guy that has empathy underneath his destructive nature.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Wreck-It Ralph,"A 3D cinema-going for the weekend of this latest Disney animation (by the luckiest chance I found one in its mother tongue). Being mainly ignorant towards the video games territory, which surprisingly did't impede my joyous time with this well-manufactured cartoon.Disney has cleverly introduced a novel space of wonders (especially towards the 1980-1990 generations who are the mostly reminiscent of the 8-bit video games era), and has conjured up a magical and colorful world with our anti-hero, Wreck-it Ralph, a villain in his game arcade pining for the penthouse life and admiration which belongs to the customary hero (Fix-it Felix). Then the storyline meanders into a default hiccup when Ralph is devoted to grab a medal to alter his villainous destiny, which for me is a bit befuddling (perhaps due to my void of background information) and stands as the low point of the film (for me at least), nevertheless, when the chief setting alters to the saccharine Sugar Rush, the film also speeds up by introducing our anti-heroine, Vanellope, a girl glitch in the game's system, who has her heart set on winning the race car competition and becoming a regular member of the game. A natural bond between these two unorthodox characters has slowly connected, with some unexpected twist in the plot (which is supposedly looming during the mid-time but executed with a quite cogent measurement). Friendship has to be tested, and a final battle is in the offing, a foreshadowing Alien-esque invasion looks like a proper payoff.The sidekicks are a tad less interesting compared with Disney's other ventures (and don't be deluded by the poster, most of the fringe characters on it have only cameos in the film) notwithstanding, the great technique of the picture (the 3D effects are also aptly conducted, at least I didn't feel giddy this time) and a not-too-star-studded but pleasantly ear-friendly voice cast should be felicitous compensations (I had put my high hope in Jane Lynch but the high point must be granted to Sarah Silverman). Thus, seriously it is a potent contender for the BEST ANIMATED FEATURE FILM.p.s.: there was an opening 7-minutes black and white animation short PAPERMAN (2012, 8/10) by John Kahrs which is also an exquisite treat for its romantic context.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Disney's 52nd is one to love,"The movie is full of entertainment and will appeal to a wide audience of both young and old, the video game references will be well received by older viewers, the younger viewers will love the rest the movie has to offer.Wreck-It Ralph is a 3D computer animated action comedy film produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios not the usual Disney/Pixar combination and it is the 52nd animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series, after Winnie the Pooh 2011. The movie takes me back to the old days when graphics wasn't key when making a video game, just fun. I loved seeing M Bison and Zangief from Street Fighter.We all struggle with accepting who we are or accepting the purpose for which we are created, and that is what Wreck It Ralph is all about accepting yourself for who you are and being proud of it.My high in this movie is the support group for video game villains, all the villains had issues with being tagged as the bad guy.The movie had been in production since the 80s but had been pushed back a lot, but finally Disney went ahead and just like Who Framed Roger Rabbit 1988 Disney featured a lot of cameo characters from many video games like Clyde the orange ghost from Pac-Man, Doctor Eggman from Sonic the Hedgehog, and Bowser from Super Mario Bro.Wreck-It Ralph (voiced by Reilly) is a character in a video game, he is the bad guy and the games protagonist and his antagonist is the game's perfect Good Guy, Fix-It Felix (voice of McBrayer).Ralph is fed up of being the bad guy, as he wishes he too could get a hero's medal, so when he runs into a first person shooter game character that was running out of his mind, Ralph took the advantage of the knocked out character, took his gear and set himself up to be used to accomplish the games objective so as to get a medal.Things took a turn for the worse when Ralph found out that the character he was impersonating was in a game that was wild and dangerous, he panicked wrecked the gameplay and while the others were resetting for another run, Ralph broke all protocols as he went after the medal, he so desperately craved.The craving led to him breaking into another arcade game meeting Vanellope von Schweetz (voiced by Silverman), a young troublemaking ""glitch"" from a candy-coated cart racing game, who turned Ralph's life around and showed him that there is more to life than his selfish ambition of being accepted by everyone.Wreck it Ralph is directed by Rich Moore who is best known for his work in the Simpsons.Rich Moore dropped an idea that he and Disney may do a sequel that may cross in to online and console gaming. Wreck it Ralph is one movie that you will enjoy on a nice afternoon with your kids or a group of your friends who will be thrilled to see some old favorite villains, it is a fun movie and I highly recommend that you get a taste of it.www.lagsreviews.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
I thought this was going to be good... but WOW,"To say that ""Wreck-it-Ralph"" is excellent is an understatement.This movie is fantastic. It perfectly combines comedy with drama and heart. The comedy comes from the many candy and game references that appeared in the dialogue and scenery. The drama comes from the twists in the plot. And the heart comes from the characters of Ralph and Vanellope.Adults will reminisce in memories of arcade games, and children will be entranced with this film. Both will love it.In short, this movie is a must-see for all ages. (In the theater, I probably saw more adults than children)",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Standard affair,"All the creativity and characters you want to see are at the beginning of the movie. Then your left in an unrecognizable world featuring a Mad Hatter rip-off and the standard annoying comedy side-kick for the vast majority of the film. Ralph himself is a good character and John C. Reilly does a great job, it's just a shame he ends up stuck in a dull world/game for most of the movie.I think the most disappointing part for me was that all those loved characters you see in the trailer and cover art have literally no part to play. I think that the trailer might just about show most of their screen-time. They are simply used for a few quick gags before disappearing. The review is purely my opinion but this is a simple fact unfortunately. It seemed to be enough for most people to get excited about though.I believe this was an opportunity sorely missed because of how versatile and in-depth the retro characters are. They also look far more interesting from a design stand point. The two 'game worlds' you enter are filled with homogenized characters and lands that you could find in any modern animation. Apart from Calhoun these characters aren't well fleshed out or interesting in anyway.Overall apart form the start of the movie, which I did enjoy, the rest descends into something closer to a Madagascar or Ice Age experience. Rather than something original and creative like The Incredibles or WALL-E. A standard affair and an opportunity missed in my eyes.",3.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Surprisingly well done!,"Let me start off by saying that I am an early college student, and I have grown up with the classic Disney movies like Aladdin and Lion King. Those were always enjoyable movies to watch, especially since they're like pieces of my childhood. Ever since then, Disney Animation Studios has been producing movies that can be considered ""forgettable"" and ""below-average"". However, after the purchase of Pixar, Disney has definitely been taking leaps and bounds in the right direction with the help of Pixar Animation Studios. Saying this, I really didn't know what to expect from ""Wreck-It Ralph"" since Pixar's name was non-existent in the movie's previews and ads. At first, I decided to steer clear from this movie...About a week after the release, I thankfully heard a lot of positive reviews and recommendations to see the movie. So, ""hey, why not,"" I decided to see the regular 2D movie. Boy, was I in for such a surprise. I was absolutely blown away by the amount of creativity and originality that was included with this movie. Knowing only a little about the older arcade games, I was still able to have a connection with the movie and follow along with the storyline really well. Speaking of the storyline, I was so amazed at how well the whole story unfolded, which included a great amount of twists and turns that constantly kept my mind active and engaged. However, being a kids' movie, I was also afraid of encountering those ""roll my eyes"" moments which are typically found in these types of movies. To my surprise again, NONE of those were found in ""Wreck-It Ralph""! The storyline was just so cleverly thought out and the plot progressed very well as the movie went on. The eye-pleasing quality of the different settings presented throughout (whether in the different arcade games, or inside the power strip) just shows the amount of imagination and creativity that was applied to the production of the movie. Also, the use of color and design elements was absolutely perfect. I really wish I could go back and see it in 3D now! The fact that both kids and adults can enjoy and share smiles to an animated movie like ""Wreck-It Ralph"" puts this movie on a high level, on which only several others have reached. I believe this is, soon to be, another Disney classic!The only thing that I disliked about the movie was the inclusion of the Rihanna song. That was just a pretty awful song choice.Other than that, *10/10 Highly Recommended!*",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
The Sweetest Arcade Villain,"The clumsy Wreck-It Ralph has been the villain of his video game for thirty years, destroying a residential building while Fix-It Felix uses his powerful hammer to rebuild what Ralph has destroyed. During the celebration of the thirtieth anniversary of the game, Ralph is not invited to the party since nobody loves him.Ralph decides to win a medal to become a hero and he goes to the game Hero's Duty, commanded by the tough Sergeant Calhoun, where he sees the chance of winning the medal. Ralph collects the aimed medal, but when he is returning to his game, he brings accidentally one enemy Cy-Bug with him. Ralph accidentally crashes his plane in the kart-racing game Sugar Rush and loses his medal. When he is ready to retrieve it, the annoying glitch Vanellope von Schweetz takes the medal and uses it to dispute a kart racing in her game.Meanwhile Felix is seeking out Ralph to tell him that their game will be shut down since he is missing. Felix meets Sergeant Calhoun that tells him that the Cy-Bug would destroy any game and he immediately falls in love with her. Ralph helps Vanellope to build her own racing car and becomes her hero; but soon he is convinced by King Candy that Vanellope is just a glitch and she may destroy Sugar Race. Ralph destroys her car and her dreams expecting to protect Vanellope. But when he sees her picture on the cabinet of Sugar Race, he learns that something is wrong in the explanation of King Candy.""Wreck-It Ralph"" is a delightful animation by the Walt Disney studios with the story of the sweetest arcade villain I have ever seen. The clumsy Ralph and his existential crisis are hilarious and the animation is a great tribute to the fans of the early video games arcade.

"Retro-cool points for sure, but needed more laughs and more heart","""It's the new Pixar film"" I said to my partner, as we sat to watch this film recently, although it didn't take me long to realize that while Disney may own Pixar now, this isn't to say that they can suddenly produce films that have made that studio so very successful. Wreck-It Ralph has the high-concept idea and shades of Toy Story in its ""alive when the lights go out"" motif, but it is disappointingly light in most things after this has settled in. The plot sees a villain in a video game setting out to be a good guy in other games so that he can return home with a prize to prove it and thus be accepted by his fellow characters.On the face of it the film has the potential to be emotional, moving and funny and you can see that it is aiming for the Pixar mould, but it just gets lost in its own plotting and forgets to do the key things well. There is a lot going on here – villains, glitches, a quest for a medal, a quest for a race, a quest to get Ralph back etc etc. All of the plotting takes time and offers little in return. The key thing for me though is that it simply isn't funny or fun enough; it has a few chuckles but nothing more than that. The characters and the jokes are pretty obvious – even the casting is easy to predict (for example the big joke around Sarah Silverman and McBrayer is that they are the characters we already know them to be in adult world). It is an adventure and will distract kids, but the laughs are too far between. The cool points are there from the start though – the 8-bit graphics, the gamer in-jokes and references, but they mostly aren't clever so much as just done and this gets old quite quickly. It is a film badly in need of genuine heart and warmth but this never comes either; we get sentimentality and moments like this but nothing real or actually moving.This is across the story, across the characters and across the jokes. It still gets cool points and it still has its moments but it is disappointingly lacking in wit and heart, leaving a lot of noise and adventure but nothing more than that. Worth a look but it doesn't even get close to the Pixar films that represent the high water mark to which it clearly aspires.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Casey's Movie Mania: WRECK-IT RALPH (2012),"In 1995, Pixar had creatively made a memorable story of how toy figures live their life in TOY STORY. Now following from the similar tradition, Walt Disney Animation Studios' WRECK-IT RALPH imagines how video game characters would come to life after an arcade closes its doors. No doubt it's a high-concept premise worth looking forward to. Special kudos to first-time feature director Rich Moore (best known for directing a few episodes of TV's Futurama and The Simpsons) for gamely exploring his nostalgic love of yesteryears as well as today's arcades generation (fans of video game are going to love this a lot) and brimming its heartwarming tale with a dash of knowing humor and genuine emotion. Not only that, WRECK-IT RALPH is one gorgeous-looking animation with an keen eye for detail, making this a fun-filled adventure for all ages.""Fix-It Felix Jr."" is an old-fashioned, 8-bit arcade game in which handyman Felix (voice of Jack McBrayer) must continuously rebuild an apartment building (with his magical hammer) after it gets demolished by the gigantic 9-foot-tall and 600-plus-pound Wreck-It Ralph (John C. Reilly). Once the arcade closes its doors, the characters in the video game clock out like a regular job and return to their own lives. For Felix and his fellow tenants, they always have great time hanging out together. But not for Ralph, who's been an outcast and villain for thirty years already. He lives in the brick pile next to Felix's apartments, and he has grown tired of being treated like a garbage.One night, Ralph finds out that there's a 30th-anniversary party going on at Felix's apartments and he's not invited at all. He gradually learns the hard truth from Felix's fellow tenants that nobody in the apartment likes him. And so Ralph sets out to prove his worth by earning his own medal from somewhere else and hopes to overcome his programming as a bad guy.Enter ""Hero's Duty"", which is a state-of-the-art, post-apocalyptic first-person shooter combat game. Ralph disguises as one of the soldiers and meets the tough Sergeant Calhoun (Jane Lynch). Along the way, he manages to prove his bravery to win the game and eventually earns a medal. However, he accidentally steps onto an egg, which unleashes a bug that rapidly multiplies in no time. Apparently those bugs capable to destroy everything and if they are not stopped, the existence of the entire arcade could be wiped out forever.But all hope is not lost, as Ralph is the only one who can saves the day. When he subsequently ends up in a colorful racing game called ""Sugar Rush"", he forces to team up with chirpy ""Sugar Rush"" outcast Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman), a ""glitch"" branded by King Candy (Alan Tudyk) who dreams of being a race car driver. They end up helping each other in a bid to win her first race, and at the same time, make things right before it's too late.First things first. The graphic animation is truly a sight to behold, and every technical departments here are simply amazing. Adding to the zest, is Henry Jackman's dynamic score that often propels the movie into a high gear.Then there's the remarkable, yet inspiring screenplay by Phil Johnston and Jennifer Lee. Throughout the movie, you can see both screenwriters and director Rich Moore have certainly puts a lot of love expanding their idea to create a knockout inside world of arcade games. For instance, the characters in the arcade games are able to cross over into other games by way of transportation zooming through the electrical cords. And every access are linked together by a Game Central Station (obviously modeled after Grand Central Station), which serves as a main hub for the game characters. Apart from that, the screenwriters knows very well how to inject enough humor, sentiment and of course, captivating characters all around.Speaking of captivating characters, WRECK-IT RALPH is certainly blessed with a wonderfully talented voice cast. Each of them deliver their characters with remarkable depth and pathos. As an anti-hero Ralph, John C. Reilly makes a likable hulk who may be a ""bad guy"" from other good-guy characters' point-of-view, but he's actually a heartfelt person especially when Vanellope reveals his true self. Sarah Silverman is both adorable and endearing as the little cute racer Vanellope who never gives up to achieve what she wants. I must say, both Reilly and Silverman made a terrific pair together. Jack McBrayer, in the meantime, is lovable as the wholesome Felix, while Jane Lynch gives a knockout performance as the no-nonsense Sergeant Calhoun. Last but not least is Alan Tudyk, who is simply spot-on playing a cunning role as King Candy.Further praise goes to Walt Disney Pictures for managed to license a healthy number of recognizable game characters throughout the movie, which is especially fun for video gamers. There's Pac-Man and his orange-ghost nemesis, Clyde; M. Bison, Zangief, Ryu and Ken from the ""Street Fighter"" series; Sonic the Hedgehog, Q-Bert, Bowser from the ""Super Mario"" series (Mario himself is actually set to cameo as well, but the producer unable to fit him somehow) and even a blink-or-you-miss, cameo appearance from an infamous ""exclamation mark"" (you know it when you hear the familiar sound) from the ""Metal Gear Solid"" series.WRECK-IT RALPH is a top-notch animation that Pixar could have added inside their roster, and certainly earns its reputation as one of the best and most entertaining animated features in a long while.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Disney attempts to do a Pixar quality animated picture without Pixar!,"'WRECK-IT RALPH': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Disney attempts to do a Pixar quality animated picture without Pixar and they don't do a bad job at it! The film tells the tale of an arcade world where the arcade characters are alive and one video game bad guy is tired of being a villain and sets out to be a hero for once (abandoning his game, which causes trouble for the rest of the game world). John C. Reilly stars as the voice of the titular character and Sarah Silverman, Jack McBrayer, Jane Lynch and Alan Tudyk co-star. Rich Moore (a veteran director of cartoon shows like 'FUTURAMA', 'THE SIMPSONS' and 'THE CRITIC') made his feature film debut directing the movie. He also co-wrote it along with Phil Johnston, Jennifer Lee and Jim Reardon. John Lasseter (a veteran Pixar director and producer) executive produced the film. The movie doesn't match the very best of Pixar but it does rival it's less than stellar offerings (There's also a Disney short film before the movie, 'PAPERMAN', that rivals the best of Pixar's shorts).The film is set at Litwak's Arcade where video game characters roam from game to game at night when the arcade is closed. Wreck-It Ralph (Reilly) is tired of being the villain of the game 'Fix-It Felix, Jr.' where the other video game characters have treated him like an outcast all of the game's thirty years of existence. Ralph decides one night, while at a video game villain support group, he no longer wants to be a villain. After learning that characters in the new first-person shooter game 'Hero's Duty' can win a medal for heroics in their game he abandons his game and sets out to win a medal there. This causes havoc not only for his game but the entire arcade as he accidentally unleashes a Cy-Bug, with powers to multiply and destroy everything in it's path (and when a video game character dies outside his own game he dies for good). Ralph meets an outcast, named Vanellope (Silverman), in a kart-racing game and the two team up in order to help each other find happiness and better fit in in to their own video game worlds.The movie is a little like a cross between 'TOY STORY' and 'TRON'; it resembles 'TRON' because of it's story involving characters that live inside a video game and 'TOY STORY' because these characters do what kid's want of them during the day but have their own lives at night, when they're not being watched. Several characters from actual video games have cameos in the film and the movie is a good tribute to video games and arcades. It's funny at times and also has a lot of melodrama (like most Disney, as well as all, animated kids films). It's got a lot of cheesy humor and drama but at times it's genuinely funny as well as touching (like most Pixar films). The message about acceptance of outcasts is also very powerful and positive for kids. It's not quite as clever as the director's TV work or as classic as 'TRON' or 'TOY STORY' but it is as good as your average Pixar film, which is what I think Disney set out to do.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6yq7kwUUDQ",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Vanellope (Sarah Silverman) is a smart mouthed girl in the game Sugar Rush.The animation is reminiscent of old arcade video styles. If you've ever played those game, you'll get a sense of nostalgia. Disney has got this part right. The best part of this must be the story. It's a poignant story of a video bad guy who's trying to fit himself into the group. He's isolated, ostracized, and ignored.

Tapping Into Arcade Nostalgia,"Before the invention of home video consoles or the smartphone games that are now so ubiquitous, there was the ""arcade generation"", who controlled their pixels at the arcade via quarters. ""Wreck-It Ralph"" taps into that ""arcade nostalgia"" by focusing on the ""downtime"" exploits of the arcade's heroes and villains.For a basic plot summary, ""Wreck-It Ralph"" follows a premise very similar to ""Toy Story"" in that when the arcade closes for the night, the characters behind the glass come to life. In one particular game entitled ""Fix-It Felix Jr."", the ""bad guy"" character named Wreck-It Ralph (voice of John C. Reily) is having a rough time due to the fact that he is an outcast in his own game. One day, Ralph decides to game-jump (a move that can have devastating consequences on all parties involved) in a quest to prove that he isn't all bad. Along the way, he meets up with a ""glitch"" named Vanellope (Sarah Silverman), who helps him to understand what being a ""good guy"" is truly all about.Story-wise, this is pretty stock Disney fare. It is a feel-good message that, at times, can get a little predictable. The voice-overs match the characters, the plot moves along nicely, and overall it is just a well-paced film. It is full of enough sight gags and crazy antics to hook the kiddies in right away and keep their interest throughout.Of course, the new era of Disney animation needs more than that, so the ""hook"" of this film is the nostalgia that adults will feel towards the arcade atmosphere. The film has cameos from many past games (Bowser, Q*bert, & the Street Fighter cast being the most obvious), as well as pays homage to the ""beeps and boops"" and sometimes jerky motions of those old classics. For true fans of the history of gaming, there are enough ""easter eggs"" hidden in the background, so to speak, to pique your interest and/or make you chuckle.Overall, ""Wreck-It Ralph"" is a fine film filled with humor, heart, and (most importantly) video game nostalgia. It isn't quite as perfectly polished as some other Disney fare (thus the one-star deduction), but it still was fun to watch for both old and young.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"OK, but over hyped by critics","Wreck-it Ralph has a familiar feel, similar in tone to the Toy Story films, as in this instead of the toys having their own personalities the video game characters do. It tells the story of Ralph who is tired of being bad. Day in and day out he wrecks Fix-it Felix's house which Felix has to (guess what) fix! Following this he tries to get himself a medal and recognition for once. The trouble is only heroes get medals and Ralph is considered the villain from the game that he is from. This leads to Ralph to try and get a medal from someone else's video game.The concept is brilliant. The possibilities seem endless. However, the way it goes about it isn't. You can't help feeling that they could have used popular video games as a basis for the movie. Yet we only get fleeting appearances of characters like Sonic. No main roles are given for characters such as these only cameos.To be fair the first half hour of the film is breath taking. So much so that I was under the impression (for half an hour) that this would be a flawless film as lush visuals fill the screen and immerse you in the world Disney has created. Ralph enters a first person shooter which is a strange form for the story to take yet it works incredibly well. It is a different move for Disney altogether.After this sequence (that is highly reminiscent of the Alien franchise) things take a turn for the worse as Disney takes a back to basics approach that is highly formulaic and only kids will love the next hour. He enters a racing video game that feels girlish and has a pink tinge to its surroundings. Too much of this has a, been there done that feel and makes the film less enjoyable to watch. For the majority of the film being set here it is a let-down and you can't help feeling numerous locations would have helped rather than being stranded in this world for nearly an hour.Some elements are good though. The character of Ralph is highly likable and one that you can feel for. (Fix-it Felix is quite poor in comparison). His emotions are understandable and it makes it easier to relate to how he is feeling. There are also never ending references to popular video game characters, which make it impossible to view all by watching it once.One final point, the 3D is excellent. The animation pops out at you from the start and engulfs you in a rainbow of colour. The animators have worked there magic here and can be praised as doing a fine job throughout the entire film. It helps that Disney have decided on an unlimited colour palette which feels reminiscent of Pixar. Just don't expect as much depth as it in terms of story and excitement.Verdict: Although still a good film, Wreck-it Ralph is noticeably not as polished as Pixar's offerings. It does not enter the same league as the Toy Story films or even some of Disney's previous like Aladdin and Hercules. Don't be fooled by critics rave reviews, Wreck-it Ralph is not a masterpiece nor is it a bad film it just ranks somewhere in between. There are lush visuals aplenty here, just lack of an entertaining glued to the seat story. If considering watching go to the cinema with fairly low expectations and you may be pleasantly surprised. If you don't you may feel let down by the high standards of Disney's previous outings.6 Out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

"Hey, He's Bad, And, Yep, That's Good!","If the Wreck-It Ralph character were, in fact, a real man he'd be 9 feet tall and approx. 640 lb. (And, of course, with the way that Ralph was built you could clearly see that his body weight was largely concentrated in his big, muscular arms and his humongous, concrete-crushing hands)Generally speaking, this CG-animated, fantasy, kiddies' picture was, for the most part, actually entertaining enough (depending, of course, on one's frame of mind) to be of some worthwhile amusement for an adult audience, as well.To say that the candy-sparkled, rainbow-coloured brilliance of this film's animation was, at times, a wildly dazzling delight would truly be an understatement.Once the action in the story shifted over into the kiddie world of ""Sugar Rush"", this film quickly accelerated into a vision of psychedelic eye-candy equivalent to that of a drug-free LSD trip.Though this $165 million production did manage to hold my interest, it certainly wasn't without its flaws and annoyances.When it came to this zany, yet quite likable, cartoon losing some points, here are 4 of my main beefs.(1) The Wreck-It Ralph character didn't do nearly enough ""wrecking"" to satisfy my expectations of his overall power.(2) With its 100-minute running time, this film seriously needed about 20 minutes worth of its story skillful edited out.(3) The female ""Sergeant Calhoun"" character (with her mean, hair-trigger temper) was such an annoying butch-broad that she put all of the male characters to literal shame with her overbearing masculinity.(4) I really resented the deliberate product placement of the ""Subway"" logo which was blatantly foisted into my face at Mr. Litwak's Arcade.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

"""My name is Ralph and I'm a bad guy""","Perhaps the most unrealistic detail about Disney's Wreck-It Ralph is that it shows arcades as places that are buzzing with activity from tykes with quarters ready to be used as turns in a video game. Arcades are not a dying breed, but a dead breed, and the only ones that exist now exist in a niche marketing for only the collector and the nostalgic types.However, I'm more than pleased with Disney's decision to introduce a younger generation to the wonders of video games mounted inside a large case, that accept quarters and in return deliver memorable action and invaluable fun. Wreck-It Ralph is among one of the brightest, most fun animated pictures I've ever seen, with look and intelligence seemingly coming from the five-letter animation studio that should remain unnamed (their main director has an ""executive producer"" credit here). Gift-wrapped in warm nostalgic vibes and beautiful whimsy, this is a picture that the kids can enjoy and the parents can enjoy, perhaps even more than their little ones. I, for one, can say I enjoyed this more than many of the rambunctious five-year-olds in my theater.The film opens with our main character Ralph (voiced fittingly by John C. Reilly) narrating his life-story, as he spends his days inside an arcade game called Fix-It Felix, Jr. as the game's main villain. His full name, ""Wreck-It Ralph,"" defines his job; he is responsible for demolishing a highrise building so that ""Fix-It Felix, Jr."" (controlled by a person in the arcade) can rebuild it quickly using his magic hammer. If the player completes the challenge, amidst while Ralph is throwing things at Felix in the process, they will then see the people who live in the highrise toss Ralph off the roof in glee. Rinse and repeat.This has been Ralph's daily routine since his first day in Litwak's Arcade. He states that he has seen many arcade machines come and go, but his old-fashioned game has gone on to be timeless along with other gems like Pac-Man. We realize that Ralph is stating his remorse and complaints to a group of other video games villains who are bad guys but ""not bad guys."" Get it? To see Dr. Eggman from Sonic the Hedgehog, Clyde, the orange ghost from Pac-Man, and other villains from beloved games gather in one room, reiterating their problems like a band of depressed AA members is touching and one of the many wonderful things about one of Disney's best films.When Ralph is not invited to the thirtieth anniversary of Fix-It Felix, Jr., he decides that is the last straw, and announces to his fellow game-members that he will abandon his duty as villain for the game to pursue other games where he will be more appreciated and, hopefully, earn a medal to show his skills and capabilities. He winds up winning a medal in a first-person shooter game called Hero's Duty, yet becomes lost in a kiddy racing game called Sugar Rush and loses his medal to a little girl named Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman).Vanellope is a glitched character, meaning she often has electronic ticks that render her as incomplete (glitches in real games usually result from a programming error). Her dream is to race with the other girls in Sugar Rush, only she is ostracized to being nothing more than a meaningless glitch. It dawns on Ralph that the only way he'll be able to get a medal is to help Vanellope win the next race and prepares her by getting her a go-kart, teaching her how to drive, and just being her faithful companion.Meanwhile, Fix-It Felix, Jr. (Jack McBrayer) worries about the fate of his arcade game, which occupies the dreaded ""Out of Order"" sign on the screen since Ralph's departure, and teams up with Sergeant Tamora Jean Calhoun (Jane Lynch), the lead character in Hero's Duty, to find Ralph and save their arcade game.What's wonderful is seeing this film come equipped with its limitless, never-ending supply of energy that many children's films tend to lack. With many different characters, personalities, and arcade worlds to explore, writers Jennifer Lee and Phil Johnston never run out of material, and the dozens of animators behind this picture never seem to run out of ideas on how to bring these worlds to life. I also adore the way the Toy Story model is erected here, where things normally controlled by humans, take on a life of their own, with real problems, complications, and mischief when they are left to fend for themselves. Seeing these characters interact with each other, behind the monitors and machines in ""Game Central Station"" is nothing shy of ingenious and marvelously entertaining.This is a film where colors, craft, characters, vision, creativity, worlds, look, voice-acting, etc shine over cartoon idiocy and redundant childishness. Wreck-It Ralph is one of Disney's strongest works in the company's history and quite possibly the closest any animation studio has come to approaching or one-upping that same five-letter studio I referred to earlier. It takes a simple, effective moral and places it as the backdrop to a story that is emotionally involved, superbly in touch, visually stunning, and fearlessly alive.NOTE: As expected, the film begins with a seven minute short, titled Paperman, about a man who is immediately taken with a woman he meets for seconds while awaiting the arrival of the morning train, and how he spends his workday trying to get her attention. Without giving anything away, just like the film that succeeds it, it is one of the best, most enjoyable shorts in years. Four stars.Voiced by: John C. Reilly, Sarah Silverman, Jack McBrayer, and Jane Lynch. Directed by: Rich Moore.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
good family fun,"Wreck-It-Ralph is a cute animated movie from Disney about a video game bad guy who decides he wants to be good. In the video game world that is created here, characters are shown to be like actors and actresses in a studio, playing roles for the benefit of their quarter carrying customers - generally preteens. Anyway, this I thought was fun. So Ralph is like an actor fed up with playing bad guy roles. Rather than wreck things, he wants to be a hero for a change. Built like the incredible Hulk, he yearns to be able to use his strength and wrecking power to do good, not bad. The plot then is built around finding a way for Ralph to be able to be this hero.The set up is engaging. Ralph find he can't really be the hero he wants to be in the game he is presently playing, so he ""walks out"" and enters some other games in the same arcade. Meanwhile, we go behind the scenes to a place that looks like Grand Central Station where game characters come and go, mingle, and spend their spare time when not ""on the set"" i.e. not playing their game roles. In other words, when no quarters are inserted in the machines, Ralph and other ""cast members"" can be found ""backstage"" like actors taking breaks. Its all kind of cute in a way. And with the set up the way it is, it also makes possible migration of characters to different games. This is where the plot takes off. Also, when game characters leave their game for whatever reason, the game is declared ""out of order"" and all characters are affected (i.e. put out of work like being laid off). So, this is the world we are introduced to here, and is what makes the story function and have some logic to it.OK, so Ralph leaves his game, putting it out of commission, and searches for one where he can be a hero. His first try fails, but in his second attempt, he meets an unfortunate but engaging little girl trapped in a CandyLand type game called ""Sugar Rush"" who is in need of a hero. Meanwhile, his fellow characters from ""wreck-it-Ralph"" come looking for him. Also, some insect like monsters he inadvertently unleashed in his first alternate game get transported to CandyLand also where they eventually wreak havoc. So, in the end Ralph gets to be the hero he craves, saving his little girlfriend while defeating the villains, both imported and ""indigenous"".And so what we end up with here is a little morality play about good and bad and how love can change everything. You see Ralph is a big crude dude and no one loved him in ""Wreck-it- Ralph"". But in ""Sugar Rush"" he is able to get a fresh start, find love, and put his wrecking power to positive use. And so eventually we learn that Ralph is a softie at heart and simply needed some love to feel good about himself. In the end, the hero's medal he craved takes a back seat to the love he found during his quest for that medal. Thats good as I didn't want him to become ""good"" just because he found himself a little piece of gold to hand around his neck. It was looking that way for a while...Anyway, I am not a gamer, but you can see that throughout the movie there is much homage being played to gaming. The plot is well thought out with enough twists and turns to keep you guessing. And the journey through CandyLand was fun with lots of humor thrown in as characters stumble across the sweet landscape. So, all in all, throw in some good music and visuals, and I found the whole trip entertaining.And if you remember ""The Wizard of OZ"", expect to see some references and parallels to it in Ralph's journey through CandyLand. Its as though Ralph traveled to OZ in search of a wizard (King Candy) to give him a medal only to find that through love and good deeds, he earns it naturally. Same lesson - you don't get something for nothing. I think it was on purpose that we come to wonder at first if Ralph can be ""good"" simply by stealing medals not belonging to him. No, he has to earn them, and eventually he does.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Fun! Friends! And Fix it Felix Jr. featuring Wreck-it Ralph,"In my recent IMDb commentary for HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA I mentioned Disney's new film WRECK-IT RALPH. This is what I wrote about it: ""one of the trailers I got to watch was the one of the upcoming Disney film WRECK-IT RALPH; it seems that ""Ralph"" will not miss the chance to deliver really clever material out of a mash-up of classic characters (video games characters, like Nintendo's Bowser, in that case)"".Now that I have finally seen it I can say that this is a film with a very nicely constructed alternate universe where video game characters are much more than a bunch of pixels. I mean, ""Ralph"" does features a whole lot of classic video game characters – in fact, it's one of those things, like the IMAGINATIONLAND trilogy of SOUTH PARK, that you have to watch frame by frame to identify all the famous characters in it. There's Pac-Man, Sonic and the STREET FIGHTER characters.Anyone who grew up in the eighties will be especially thrilled to see those characters, although they are only extras or, in some cases, just part of the background. This goes for that creation of an alternate universe; and it's a real success, with really clever and fun ideas. It's a TOY STORY sort of thing, just replace toys with video game characters and try to answer that same question of ""what would they do if they were anthropomorphic characters?"" If the toys have to work for the kids, the video game heroes and villains too – here's there's a whole working system, like in MONSTERS, INC.Yes, in ""Ralph"" we have clever ideas through and through, as if it was another gem from Pixar. For instance, we learn everything that happens when a game either breaks or goes out of fashion (it's pretty rough for the characters as you can tell); we have too stuff like a great reference to the differences between the games from the golden age of the arcade and the modern HD ones such as CALL OF DUTY and GEARS OF WAR. The premise itself is really nice: the villain of a game (Ralph – voice of John C. Reilly) is simply tired of his daily job and wants to become the hero!As a movie about video games, ""Ralph"" is definitely a blast. But as a whole, well, it's not something annoying and noisy like ""Transylvania"" but nevertheless it's an average, just-to- see-once, flick. It ain't a gem like, you know, almost every one from the catalog of Pixar.*Watched it on 11 November, 2012",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
What's with the fuss?,"I honestly don't understand why everyone's raving about this movie. For me, the biggest drawback and constant grater on my nerves are the absolutely annoying characters, beginning with the titular character himself to the most unmemorable villain.Let's start with Ralph. I get that he's being treated like garbage and he wants to get more out of his existence despite everyone around him telling him he should stick to the status quo. That's nothing new (and nowhere even close to the ballpark of original). But did he have to be such a selfish, self-serving jerk about it? He stormed into Hero's Duty, almost revealed the big secret (that video game characters have lives outside of the arcade's opening hours), stole the medal, released the evil little bug thingies, destroyed property.... the list goes on. And all without even a hint of regret or contrition, an ounce of self-awareness, and the slightest regard that he was jeopardising every other characters' livelihoods (and lives) JUST so he can serve his own selfish, deluded desire to get a medal. That's like saying, ""Hey kids, it's okay to cause trouble to everyone because you're just trying to get what you want and there's nothing wrong with that.""It's just so...American.And Vanellope! She's spoiled, selfish, and annoying as well. It's like they all have tunnel vision or something. It's all about 'me, me, me. It's what I want and it's what I'm going to get'. Case in point, she totally took that medal even though Ralph begged for it and practically sobbed out how much it meant to him. And she threw it into a freaking cauldron, fully knowing that it would disintegrate (doesn't matter that the medal's going to reappear IF she wins the race). I just...It's like every action the characters do cause stress to me. Felix is a spineless fool. Calhoun was promising in the beginning but her backstory was more like a parody than something that was supposed to give her dimensions. King Candy was like that raisin-filled chocolate that nobody likes but is somehow always in the box. He's uncanny and out of place (even though we all discover the reason for that later).The graphics were great, though. The inclusion of all the game characters was interesting. It gets a little off-putting with all the obvious product placements but it gives the viewers a nice opportunity to relate to some of the things shown.But the clichéd plot and the characters that absolutely grated on your nerves are the dealbreakers. I couldn't even sit through until the end. Left the theatre an hour into the movie. And I thought Brave was bad.",2.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Another level,Wreck-It Ralph sees Disney trying to go the Pixar route before they decided to buy the company. It is a brisk colourful animation taking a retro look at arcade games. However the makers saw too many Pixar films because you can easily guess who the real villain really is going to be as it follows the Pixar beats too closely and adds some Disney mush to it as well.Wreck-It Ralph is the villain in an old 8 bit arcade game Fix-It Felix Jr. It really is a thinly disguised version of Donkey Kong. Ralph though has had enough of being a villain with no character development. He does not even get invited to the game's 30th anniversary party that Felix and his crew throw.Out of the game Ralph is a nice but clumsy guy who just wants to join in with the others but the villains of the arcade games tend to be ignored. So Ralph goes to join another arcade game in order to win a medal and gets involved in more adventures. Felix goes after him before his malfunctioning arcade game is switched off for good.,6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"I'm bad, and that's good. I will never be good, and that's not bad. There's no one I'd rather be than me","Directed by Rich MooreStarring John C Reily, Jack McBrayer and Jane Lynch.Written by Rich Moore, Phil Johnson, Jim Reardon, Jennifer Lee, Sam J Levine, John C Reily and Jared Stern.'A video game villain wants to be a hero and sets out to fulfill his dream, but his quest brings havoc to the whole arcade where he lives.' As I was watching this film, I kept thinking how predictable it was going to be because all G and PG rated films are these days. But once I was guessing the right way, the film went left and I was very impressed.'Wreck-it Ralph' was an amazing movie. I loved it. There were so many aspects I enjoyed. Examples include the great effects such as how each arcade serves as a hangout for all the characters during closing time. I found the story behind that similar to Toy Story and Who framed Roger Rabbit. How each toy comes to life as humans leave the scene and how the society of characters in arcades acted as 'Toon Town'. Another effect aspect was how they portrayed the first person shooting game within the game itself. It shows the characters point of view rather than the gamer. It was innovative and awesome. The writing in this film was great. The characters were drawn out so well and the plot twist was something I was not expecting. I salute the writers!The cast and characters were astonishing! I was surprised with John C Reily. I never would suspect he would be a voice in an animated feature. I love him as an actor but I never paid much attention to his voice, plays really well in this movie. It's quirky, funny and has meaning. Gives a lot to his character. I enjoyed seeing all the characters from old video games including Bowser, Ryu, Sonic, Zangief and Pac Man. It was a joy to look on screen to see all the familiar faces again. The story between Jane Lynch and Jack McBrayer's characters was heart warming and hilarious. I don't want to give away too much information away because it was something I was not expecting and brightened up the whole film for me. My only criticism, which is very small is that all the familiar characters from old video games didn't have much of an impact on the story. Though the story was great, it wouldn't have hurt to add a classic character to the mix.This film blew me away! The characters, effects and writing all came together to portray one of the best films of the year. It's difficult to find a PG film these days that will satisfy all age levels and this film does just that. A definite must see!",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
heart in the right place (hands off Mr. Zombie!),"Wreck it Ralph is self-consciously retro (Ralph even says so himself). In a year where animated films come into their own, this is a particularly brilliant entertainment.The animation is delightful, the jokes are funny and smart, the characters brilliant, the story soars.I was reminded of another retro Disney film 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?' which wasn't really for kids, in fact I don't really know who it was for... In comparison this gets it all right; it's cute smart funny moving: fabulous. Sugar Rush is so brilliantly delicious that I just felt like living there, the observations and the details throughout the film are priceless.You'd think that maybe you'd be encouraged to dislike Ralph's nemesis Fix it Felix Jnr. - the good guy - but instead he almost steals the show! Great work with the script and voice-actors whose work shines through here.John Lasseter proves again that he is even better at knocking Disney projects out of the park, than with his sometimes more strange and awkward projects at Pixar.

"A Sentimental Arcade Adventure With Tons of Style, But Limited Substance","Cute, family-friendly adventures with a wealth of buried treasure scattered about for long-term arcade denizens. It's a fun twist on the sentimental framework established by Toy Story, but when the sight gags, winks and grins run out it feels a bit thin. The prologue hints at something really dense, vivid, expansive and bright, especially in the bad guys' support group scene that's featured in all the trailers, but the story never truly delivers on that potential. As a small-scale adventure it's just fine, and I certainly appreciated the efforts it made to secure so many cameos from classic gaming characters. It looks great, both in full 3D and pixelated 8-bit facsimile, and the voice acting is a series of loose, warm, top-notch efforts. The concept feels like it never gets fully off the ground, though, and a long layover in one particular game world puts the brakes on what was, until then, a slick, snappy pace. I guess at the end of the day, the comparisons to recent Pixar and Disney epics are inevitable, and it's a clear step or two below that level of prestige. A good, safe effort that's worth a lazy watch, but not exactly what I was hoping for.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Original movie, and not just for kids","Original movie, and not just for kids. Very novel plot - arcade game characters have a life, away from the video game. With this as a background, the plot lends itself to many adventures, some in-game and some not.Mainly a kids movie. The plot is a tad overly sweet and harmless. However, there are many emotional moments which will appeal to adults. Plus, some jokes and scenarios only adults would understand (not dirty, just do rely on knowing more about life and the world).John C Reilly is perfectly cast as the voice of Wreck-it-Ralph. Come to think of it, every voice is spot-on. I couldn't think of anyone who would suit Fix-it Felix more than Jack MacBrayer. Similarly, Sarah Silverman and Jane Lynch are great as Vaenellope and Calhoun respectively.Good, clean fun.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

This isn't one of them.The morality is questionable. The humor is crude.

Wreck-It Ralph: A Villain's Destructive Path to Heroism,"It isn't easy being the bad guy, especially when you are the villain in a video game forced to repeat your destructive tendencies on a daily basis. The title character of Wreck-It Ralph faces this particular dilemma. Ralph is tired of being the ""bad guy"" in the game: Fix-It Felix Jr. Ralph's role puts him at odds with his adversary, Felix Jr., who garners all the praise and adoration from the townspeople after he fixes Ralph's destruction. Ralph's jealousy of Felix comes to a head on the thirtieth anniversary party for Fix-It Felix Jr. Upon being shunned from the party, Ralph decides that the only obstacle keeping him from achieving the rank of hero is a golden medal. Determined to win the respect of his fellow game characters, Ralph sets out to accomplish something that is forbidden in the arcade world: stealing an item from another game.Wreck-It Ralph beautifully combines animation that audiences have come to love with a nostalgic look at the wonders of the arcade world. In a time when arcades are rapidly waning in popularity, Ralph revitalizes characters from classic games, and introduces unique new characters into the Disney pantheon. Pac-Man, Q*bert, Sonic the Hedgehog, Bowser, and numerous other characters from arcade classics have cameos in this movie. Whether you are a hardcore video game aficionado, or someone who has spent little-to-zero time in an arcade, Wreck-It Ralph is a film that you are sure to enjoy.Disney sans Pixar has had some difficulty creating films that entice both children and parents. After a long string of pandering sequels, and weak features, Disney Animation Studios appears to have their formula down. 2010's Tangled was a welcomed surprise, and Wreck-It Ralph is equally enjoyable. Director Rich Moore does an excellent job blending a morality play into the video game world. Screenwriters Phil Johnston (Cedar Rapids) and Jennifer Lee compose a script that is packed with references to video games, candy, and classic cinema. One of the funniest segments in the film involves Ralph attending ""Bad-anon"", a support group for video game villains (think AA, but with a Pac-Man ghost and Zangief from Street Fighter). When Ralph enters the game ""Sugar Rush"", Johnston and Lee inundate the dialogue with references to candy and sweets, which grows stale as time progresses, but carries a sugary taste in the beginning. The talents of the director and writers are on full capacity during the majority of this feature.John C. Reilly, Jack McBrayer, Jane Lynch, Sarah Silverman, and Alan Tudyk all lend their voice talents to this production. John C. Reilly (Ralph) continues to be one of my favorite actors, voicing Ralph so fluidly that one can't help but think this role was written precisely for him. Jack McBrayer is lovable as always, playing an overeager Felix, whose charm lies in his quirky euphemisms and doe-eyed stares. Felix, swooning for Jane Lynch's Calhoun, delivers one of the greatest lines in the movie: ""Oh, that's not from blunt force trauma ma'am. That's just the honey glow in my cheeks."" Sarah Silverman (Vanellope) plays a character ostracized in her game due to being a ""glitch"". She is the annoying sidekick who demeans Ralph constantly, but still manages to earn his adoration. The role was developed with Silverman in mind, and her raspy voice compliments her character's brashness perfectly. Alan Tudyk plays one of the most divisive roles in the film. His character, King Candy, is a bubbling buffoon, who has dark motives, and an inexplicable drive to see Ralph and Vanellope fail. Moore himself supplies the voices of a number of characters in the film—his turn as Sour Bill is delightfully droll.Wreck-It Ralph is currently the highest-grossing film of the weekend, and is sure to remain among the top features of this season because of its dynamic appeal and heartening story. Although the second portion of the film seems hustled, and several scenes in ""Sugar Rush"" are clichéd and lazily scripted, the film as a whole exceeds. The ending is very satisfying, and features a plot manipulation that is brilliant. Ralph is sure to become one of the prized characters in the Disney catalog.

Entertaining children's film about computer games; fun!,"From the get-go, I really enjoyed this film. It was a clever premise, that computer game characters are real and interact with each other. The characters were well drawn, fun and endearing. Typical children's film in that it speaks to the underdog and outcast being the hero, and friendships being formed unlikely places. For children, to be sure, but certainly enough in it for adults to enjoy. Really enjoyable, entertaining and laugh out loud funny in places. Great voice-actor performances from an all-star cast including John C Reilly, Jack McBrayer, Jane Lynch and Sarah Silverman and the design of the entire film is in the style of many video arcade games, which is clever.

Video Game Rush!,"Disney's 52nd full-length animated feature film takes us to the video game world, where villain Wreck-it Ralph is tired of being the bad guy and living in the dumps. He wants to be a hero so he could join his ""hero"" friends in their upscale pad and, therefore, seeks to become one by obtaining a medal. However, he inadvertently causes a virus to be unleashed in the central game console, threatening all the games in the arcade.I thought the idea of an animated movie about video game characters was a clever touch from Disney; it was interesting to see what the video game characters with their time after the arcade closes (like the toys coming to life after the kids leave in the Toy Story movies). They travel back and forth to their own versions of meeting rooms, bars and penthouses through stations, which in real life are the areas behind power outlets. It was also interesting seeing famous video game characters come to life like Sonic, King Koopa and Pac-Man. This gave the film a very intriguing start and draws you into the story and the plot of the virus invading the entire arcade. However, I thought all the hype and tension faded away when Ralph enters the Sugar Rush candy game and meets the bubbly but overzealous and annoying Vanellope, who wants Ralph to help her win a car race. This plot element consumed a huge part of the movie and overshadows the virus threat story. I may be in the minority on this, but I think the film would have been much more fun if the virus plot was emphasized more and actually showing all the arcade characters in danger or contributing to the mission of destroying the virus. It's too bad the more famous characters like Sonic, Mario, Koopa, Pac-Man and others weren't given larger and more significant roles in the film (I'd prefer the filmmakers use those over some of the main characters used).The animation was nicely done, giving you a very video-game feel and reminding you that Disney animated movies have really come a long way. I didn't care much for the rock music soundtrack or the Sugar Rush plot, though, and I thought the film had limited suspense. I do like the Ralph character and his purpose in the story, but it's really just a big car race and a search-and-destroy movie, with too much of an emphasis on the candy stuff.Grade C-",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A terrific Xmas treat for the whole family.,"It's quite apt that a large portion of Disney's latest animated adventure takes place within an arcade game called Sugar Rush, as it's the perfect description for this colourful, high-tempo caper. When Ralph (John C. Reilly) decides he no longer wants to be the bad guy for the Fix-It Felix Jr. video game – after three decades of unrecognised service – he treks out to other machines in search of heroic glory. The tale of accepting who you are is as old as cinema itself, however the joy here is in the eclectic characters and their fish-out-of-water experiences. The Mouse House has a bit of coin and as such we get a vast array of identifiable faces – the ""baddies anonymous"" meeting in the opening scene features everyone from Sonic the Hedgehog's villain Dr Eggman, Mario's nemesis Bowser and a Pacman ghost – yet it's the made-up avatars that truly shine. The eponymous klutz Ralph and his nice-as-pie foe Felix (Jack McBrayer) are fantastic polar opposites, whilst Hero Duty's battle-hardened warrior Calhoun (Jane Lynch) and Sugar Rush glitch Vanellope (Sarah Silverman) pinch the limelight whenever on screen; the former's penchant for badass one-liners and the latter's indefatigable enthusiasm both proving to be infectious and memorable.

Reilly) who's tired of being the villain of the Fix-It Felix, Jr. (Jack McBrayer) video game because of the negligent treatment from the rest of the inhabitants of his game. So he goes to another one to get a medal and then another one where he meets a girl who feels as lonely as him. I'll stop there and just say that I throughly enjoyed the creative visuals employed throughout and the way the story went. Other voices like those of Jane Lynch and Sarah Silverman were also good but I was most impressed by that of Alan Tudyk as King Candy which he seemed to imitate Ed Wynn for since the character looked like Wynn's Mad Hatter in Disney's Alice in Wonderland from 1951. In summary, Wreck-It Ralph gets a high recommendation from me.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Enjoyable,"The concept of Wreck-It Ralph is excellent but the end result maybe didn't live up to the expectation. Seeing the poster for example, one might think that the movie will really feature the characters of the classic video games, but ultimately there are only a few interactions with them and you can count their scenes on the finger of one hand.Still, the movie is enjoyable despite the fact that the script revolves mostly around the Sugar Rush universe, which isn't bad, but maybe didn't deserve that much room in the story.The dialogues are rather well written, and a few puns and product placements smartly add a fun touch to the scenario. Unfortunately, the movie maybe lacks a bit of a more adult humour, more caustic probably, or different layers of interpretation like some Pixar productions managed to do.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A Disappointing Execution of a Great Idea,"Wreck-It-Ralph creates an extremely promising world that's brilliantly designed and animated and fleshes it out with a story that's entirely generic and worn out. I remember liking this quite a bit when I saw it in theaters, but maybe I was just on a high after seeing Paperman play right before it. It's frustratingly mediocre, and the fact that it doesn't seem to have any ambitions beyond that makes it even more disappointing this time around.Ralph is a pretty lovable character by the end of the movie, though I had a really hard time feeling sorry for his plight at first because he seemed to cause all the problems for himself, but once he meets up with Vanellope and helps her along he becomes a big-hearted guy worth cheering for. I wish he had a better movie around him. I think the moral of being comfortable with yourself is a little hazily told, but it seems like a good lesson for kids.I will say that despite my distaste for much of it I was never not engaged. The world is a lot of fun and the voice actors do well. I completely love the idea of the central station, that's so clever. So is the bad-guy group session. It's the details like that that make this movie worth watching, but they're also hints of a better movie that never arrives.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Better than Toy Story!,"Disney with John Lasseter's guidance have finally equalled Pixar's masterpiece Toy Story!Take the central conceit of the inner life of toys and transfer it to the arcades. Toy Story may be the originator of this idea, but Wreck It Ralph is able to dig deeper and push it further, with a classic children's tale of archetypes and life affirming messages.The arcade characters have a back story and character arc that allows Disney to pile on the layers of meaning and depth. Like the Toy Story trilogy this is about much more than just a Hero's journey, with the same interest in a subtext of philosophy and the meaning of happiness.Also just like the fictional toys in Toy Story, Disney have much fun in creating three perfect video games from different eras, that are just so good you can't believe they don't already exist. The game worlds Fixit Felix Jr and Sugar Rush are the equivalent to Woody's and Buzz's respective universes. Two very different worlds and philosophies driving much of the story. Ralph is even presented with a morale dilemma all the equal of Woody's choice in Toy Story 2. Which is resolved with typical inventiveness.It perhaps lacks the universal appeal as people are still a little prejudice towards videogames. They were preaching to the converted with this viewer, I can only hope that this film is a step in the right direction in improving the acceptance of a valid entertainment medium. It is certainly not just all about shooting things!Hopefully Wreck-It Ralph will entertain you too and maybe we'll get an equally well thought out sequel featuring the nasty game collector that wants to lock the game cabinet away in a museum so no one can play it. Just a thought.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Sometimes it is good to be bad...,"I must say that ""Wreck-It Ralph"" was something different than most other animated movies I have seen in quite some time. The whole aspect of the characters on the arcade machines coming to life in their own worlds once the arcade halls close down for the evening was quite interesting. And it was nice, for a gamer since the early 1980's, to recognize characters from the many different games.The story in ""Wreck-It Ralph"" is fairly straight forward, though awfully predictable. About Ralph, the villain from a golden oldie arcade wanting to be a good guy and sets out to get win a medal to prove his heroism in another arcade game. But his well-intended efforts end up proving to have catastrophic ripples in the land of the arcade, as virus bugs threaten to take over.""Wreck-It Ralph"" offers a good amount of likable characters that are nicely animated and fleshed out on the screen. They are given good personalities and they had a good ensemble of people on the list for the voice acting.The animation in the movie is good, as to be expected from a Disney production. But the levels of details here is just jaw-dropping, which makes it all the more enjoyable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Wrecking my little heart.,"As a gamer, I was completely taken by surprise at how much this movie captivated me. I was blessed as a child to be homeschooled, and through that, I experimented with games from essentially every genre and system. Luckily, I was able to play ancient titles, like Qbert and the ORIGINAL Donkey Kong. There are so many fun references and sound effects relating to old games from eons past, but at the same time, Wreck-It Ralph manages to captivate non-gamer audiences as well!Wreck-It Ralph is about a villain from an arcade game called Fix-It Felix. Ralph goes through and messes up a building, and Felix comes in to fix up the building, whilst Ralph is dropping crap on Felix, a la classic Donkey Kong. Eventually, Ralph just wants to fit in, seeing as he is always the bad guy, and THUS begins our hero-villain's journey.I love the concept of Wreck-It Ralph, and the execution is flawless. It's a wonderfully animated film, and you grow attached to character's very quickly. I've never seen John C. Reilly as someone that I could grow attached to, but he proved me wrong with this one Same for Sarah Silverman Or Jane Lynch Heck, they were all great. I should also mention that there were points in Wreck-It Ralph where I felt like the filmmakers were pulling my heart from my body, and then proceeded to step all over it, spitting on it, and crushing it. Absolutely heart- wrenching. I was torn up during Wreck-It Ralph. If you have a weak heart, you might perish while watching it. Also, a GREAT family movie. Just go see it.Wreck-It Ralph fixes my hope for John C. Reilly, and gets an 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Disney hits it out of the park yet once again!,"Wreck-It Ralph Disney is awesome 3/4 starsAfter taking in quite a few animated films with my kids i would have to say this surprised me as i found the others duds and actually quite boring. Great original storyline that has all the bad guys from the 80's era games or 8-bit if you will meeting regularly to share the dark secrets are astonished when the bad guy and main character from The Wrekk-it Ralph game announces that he wants to be a good guy and for once be the one who gets the medal and stands on top of his famed apartment building with the tenants he saved, In Wreck-it Ralph, Ralph destroys the building whilst fix it Felix jumps up and down the building fixing all that Ralph has destroyed both antagonists racing to the top to save the tenants. Felix usually saves the day and stands proudly on top with the tenants as poor Ralph sits angrily at the bottom of the building in a puddle of mud.Ralph has had enough of this and tells Felix during a 30th anniversary celebratory party that he is done 'wrecking' and is gonna find his medal so he can be the victor for once. this starts the film leading us into something i personally imagined as a teen gamer growing up in the 80's...what it would be like to be inside the game? Ralph jumps from game to game inside an arcade...going through the wires and digital circuitry. True to his name, Ralph wrecks everything and ends up unleashing a evil force onto the gaming world and has top team up with a young 'glitch' racecar driver named Vanellope who was outcast from her car racing game 'Sugar Rush' in order to win the race and defeat the evil so all is well in gaming land yet once again.Actors lending their vocal talents to the film were John C. Reilly (Ralph), Sarah Silverman (Vanelope) Jane Lynch (Calhoun..who comes from a HD graphic FPS game and whose character was definitely drawn perfect for her) to name a few. Great CGI animation and kudos to Disney for providing a movie that the whole family can enjoy, even someone like me who doesn't really care for this genre of films. It was a very nice change then sitting bored out of mind for 1hr and 30mins.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Game Master,"I've been a gamer ever since I was six years old and I still am to this day, I've been there from the video arcades to the console gaming we have now so yeah that's how far my video gaming experience and love for the genre has gone. This film is a dream come true, it's one of those movies I feel were just made for me, I'm glad that finally someone had the guts utilize this idea because like any great video game it actually works.There is just so much I love about this movie it's both a fun and touching underdog story but also a love letter to video games. The animation is just top notch, I just love the character designs from the video game characters were familiar and had cameos like Q-Bert, Pac-Man, Ryu, Ken, you name it. Down to the character focused on my favorite design is Vanellope because she so darn cute. But what impresses me more are the background designs, like the arcade itself and the arcade cabinets animated, for the record most of the video games cabinets seen are actual video games. And the video game worlds were great my favorite one was the Suger Rush world, the game was a mix of both ""Mario Kart"" and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"".I simply love the concept that the world of video games is real and that each of the video games are businesses where they work. The humor is great both visual and verbal. There are just so many jokes, homage jokes, and in jokes on some of the clichés and elements in video games, it would probably take more than one watch to catch most to all of them, but there there. From big jokes like the fact there is some sort of group therapy session for bad guys, Oreo Cookie guards, to even tiny jokes like how some of the characters in Ralph's world move which is a little stiff it makes sense since most old games were restricted to certain movements as contrasted with the games we have now where we have more freedom of movement.Even though the film and the characters aren't so serious you do care about them. From supporting characters like Felix (Jack McBrayer) whom is a Mario like protagonist that is unsmooth. Calhoun (Jane Lynch) is a ""Gear of War"" like heroine that despite being tough as nails is a softy at heart. I just love how much spit fire she has though another thing that's funny about her is her tragic back story. This is funny because it's true, it's a common cliché with a lot of our current video game heroes and heroines because by it's nature it's a motive device to give them a reason to do what they do. I like the back and forth between them both are sort of a conflicting and correlating dynamic where Felix is the representation of old school gaming and Calhoun new school. Even like the romance between them which is strange (well not that strange if you think of Mario and Princess Peach) but sweet.Ralph (John C Really) is great, he's a gentle blue collar giant who really isn't a bad guy that's just simply his job, but is really a good guy. He's sympathetic because he's an underdog that really gets no respect or even credit for doing his job. This guy has a dream of just having more in his life or at least for life to get better. My favorite line from Ralph is, ""When did video games become so violent and scary?"" I always cracked up because it's really not a bad question.But my favorite character though is Vanellope, from the fact she's voiced by one of my favorite comedians Sarah Silverman but I just love her character because she funny as hell. She just has loads of hyper energy makes sense since she lives in a world of candy, has some of the best darn lines, but also just like Ralph her character is an underdog which makes her sympathetic because she's a person with a dream of just wanting to do what she loves racing but is just always getting crap canned because of the fact she glitches, but trust me that glitch is a gift in disguise. I like the back and forth dynamic with Ralph and her, it's pretty much like a buddy buddy comedy.If the film has a message it's about being more than what you are and to not let labels define you.Wreck it Ralph scores.Rating: 4 stars",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Another Superb Disney Animation,"Wreck It Ralph tells the story of Ralph, a video game character that is tired of being the ""bad guy"" all the time and sets out on an adventure to find a way of becoming a ""good guy"", but inadvertently causes madness & mayhem as he goes.Disney have done it again with yet another animation classic in Wreck It Ralph. I loved this movie for a number of reasons, one being that it was a wee trip down memory lane in seeing characters from games I used to play as a kid, including Sonic the Hedgehog; Ken, Ryu, M. Bison and Zangief from the Street Fighter games; Kane from Mortal Kombat (one of my favourite games of all time); and Pac-Man. Even the two stick figures playing tennis from Pong are shown.Some really good ideas enter into the movie as well, such as Game Central Station (which is basically a huge socket adapter that the arcade machines all get plugged in to) where all the game characters travel to and from their games when the arcade is closed. Another is the Bad-Anon which is a villains support group for any of the games bad guys for when they are feeling unhappy about their roles.As we have come to expect from Disney movies as well the animation is absolutely superb. The way the animation gets handled between the different games in the movie is excellent also, going from the graphics we saw in the old console/arcade games where they were more blocky and jerkier (which was cutting edge back then) to the more sublime, smoother graphics we see for the newer games nowadays.This is a movie that will appeal to all kids and adults alike. Some of the humour in the movie may be classed as a bit ""crude"" by some (over-protective) parents, but these jokes will just go right over the heads of the younger kids (just like some jokes in the Shrek movies), so it's really nothing to worry about at all.I think this is the best Disney animation movie that I've seen probably since Despicable Me, so I would definitely recommend it if you've not seen it yet.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

The Best Video game Movie Ever Made,"After seeing the trailer in June, I have been anxiously waiting to see this movie. Well, the hype is legit and Wreck It Ralph is the best animated movie of the year! John C. Reilly plays Ralph, the bad guy of Fix-It-Felix's arcade game, and delivers an outstanding performance. Being a hero is an overplayed storyline in almost all animated movies, but Disney makes Wreck It Ralph fresh and original. I was laughing the entire film and it's charm won me over. As a hardcore gamer, the soundtrack and appearances of various video game characters and references was awesome. It was not only nostalgic, but cool which brought back great memories of going to the arcade and putting quarter after quarter in a machine. Overall, I was blown away by Wreck It Ralph. WHATEVER YOU DO GO SEE IT! And I'll definitely be seeing it again in 3D!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Good film,"Good film. At the beginning of the film Ralph is misunderstood and mistreated by everyone. His ""job"" is to be the bad guy and he's treated as such even though he's actually a nice guy who's been assigned a crummy position. So you'd think that by the end of the film everyone will realize what jerks they've been and that the real villains are themselves. The lesson - look beneath the surface and treat people how they deserve to be treated not just the way you think they should be treated. Wrong!!! There's only one very brief scene where Felix realizes how unfair he's been to Ralph, and that's as close as this movie comes to getting the right message across. In the end things improve for Ralph and the others give him the respect he deserves, but they do it for all the wrong reasons. Instead of celebrating him for being the great guy he's been all along, Ralph saves the day and proves himself to be a hero.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
I'm not a gamer...,"OK, so I'm not a gamer by any means & my review is going to be non-techy. Hey, I liked PacMan back in the day and now that seems archaic.I went to see this Wreck-it Ralph because it looked like fun. And it was. This movie has beautiful visual colors/scenes and funny antics & lines galore. The storyline is very clever and engaging. And I loved the sessions with the other game icons, very cute. The actor voices were right on, especially Silverman. Wow, how can her voice sound like that?What I wonder is will kids like this movie? To me it seemed rather adult in the story and I'm not sure a kid under 10 would necessarily get it. But an older kid or adult who likes animation and creativity will love it. It is amazing what they do with animation today and this really is a feast for the eyes. With a fast pace and good dialog, this movie kept my attention and had me laughing at times and leaving with a smile on my face. That's a good sign to me.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

I'm glad they didn't go out of their way to use awkward outdated slang trying to appeal to the kids because that is a recipe for disaster. It's not that embarrassing to watch, and I like the arcade world and how they handle the games. That being said, I simply think the story is shallow, nothing special about it. It's a nice message, just overused. Overall, a bit plain but enjoyable nonetheless, a good watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

The movie pays tribute, but melds it all into a perfect world all its own. The story is simple, classic, and to the point. There's little in the way of Follywood demographic button-pushing and it somehow makes even the light toilet humor seem classy.Films like this, the Incredibles, UP, etc. make one wonder if not all of the best talent in motion pictures is in animation these days.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Are arcade machines do kids still play those machines,"(2012) Wreck-It-Ralph
COMPUTER ANIMATION /FAMILYThe title ""Wreck-It-Ralph"" is a name of an old arcade game coming to life in their own video game world interacting with other gaming characters also popular in video game machines is an idea similar to the ""Shrek"" movies when you involve other characters as well. Except that not everybody who watches movies plays video games, and that the additional fairy tale characters in the Shrek movies had movie animations already been made about them. I mean who hasn't seen Disney movies such as ""Snow White"" and ""Pinocchio"" when they kids. Also, the gaming characters could 'only' correspond with each other and no body else which is sort like the ""Matrix"" where the characters can go through wires and so forth... Anyways, the story starts with Ralph and he gets tired always acting like the bad guy so he goes on a crusade to prove to his fellow characters that his character can just be as important as Felix who's also called ""Fix-It-Felix"". Along the journey we also meet a racing character from another video arcade game called Vanellope who at first was supposed to be a video game glitch for at first neither of them didn't get along for it regards a metal. One of the problems although a minor one is the fact that although we're well aware about ""Wreck-It-Ralph"" the arcade game viewers are somewhat baffled about the arcade game with Vanellope except that it's a racing game. Also, the story doesn't really pick up interest until at least after the 45 minute mark since the film does take a considerable amount of time with character development. What does keep viewers interested are not so much the characters but the visuals which the odd gaming environment can really stand out because of many bright colors used. It gets really high marks for the look and visuals but not so much on nostalgia- as a matter of fact, I thought it'd been much more effective if it dealt with video game characters that didn't exist since some are games people recognize while they're others I don't recognize at all and that can at times be a distraction as a whole.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Like Pixar used to make,"Back in the day Pixar would put together culturally-aware, well-written animated fare for children and the parents who had to take them to the movie theater. While ""Wreck-It Ralph"" is no ""Wall-E"" or ""Monsters, Inc"", it is a smart, fun little romp through the annals of video gaming history. John C. Reilly nails the titular role by essentially playing it as the anti-Robin Williams. His even keeled, thoughtful, world-weary, voice work brings a deserved respite from the rapid-fire, jump-cut work of the animated videogames that serve as the film's locations. Rather than the over-the-top scene chewing, you would get from most other voice actors, Reilly delivers a believable relationship arc with Sarah Silverman's video game racing little girl. This warmth carries the film through some slow spots and obvious points where the writers have to wait for something to happen or where they have to write themselves out of corners (wait, so characters who are a product of programming code can change programming code?). Television actors Jack McBrayer and Jane Lynch are cast to type and log decent costarring performances. The animation they inhabit is very inventive and smartly emulates thirty years of computational improvements from Fix-It Felix's Donkey Kong clone to the latest Halo-esque first person shooter. However, even non-gamers will find smart references and good performances worth seeing. In short, definitely one to add to your must-see animation list and hopefully one John Lassiter and the boys at Pixar saw.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

A Visual Feast with a Generous Helping of Clever Wit and a Big Scoop of Genuine Heart,"The visual splendor alone of every scene, of every frame, elevates this modest but heartfelt film to classic status, but it's the inspired storytelling which truly distinguishes this tribute to those innocent days at the very dawn of our video game saturated culture. Easily one of the most clever, entertaining and satisfying children's computer animated films I've ever seen, up there with the Toy Story trilogy, Wall-E, the Incredibles, and Finding Nemo.Like Toy Story and Wall-E, Wreck-It Ralph relies on a very potent mix of bittersweet nostalgia for a bygone age and an acid sharp cynicism for an increasingly uncomfortable future. The result is an endlessly endearing cautionary tale warning us to be wary of the myriad increasingly complex and seductive technological innovations which are threatening to overwhelm us with their irresistible electronic magic. That's a dicey position for a computer generated film to take and it acknowledges its own potential hypocrisy with some very astute and hilarious self deprecating humor.The movie is also saved from descending into self parody on the strength of the very fine performances of its leads. John C. Reilly's naturally affable manner imbues Ralph with a nuanced blend of restrained self pity and emphatic hopeful pride, enriching his character with genuine humanity. And Sarah Silverman is a shear delight as the quick witted pixie faerie who blithely coaxes and goads Ralph to fulfill his destiny as savior of their realm.Pixar's Toy Story is the original classic computer animated film and rightfully lays claim to the title as Champion of the form, and Pixar's Wall-E certainly upped the stakes with its positively mature and sophisticated theme of catastrophic environmental abuse by an increasingly contented and oblivious populace, but Disney's Wreck-It Ralph achieves greatness by virtue of its unbounded love for its subject and the infectious joy with which it's brought to life. Effervescent glee bursts from every detail. Wreck-It Ralph cheerfully destroys all resistance on its whimsical mission of mass appeal.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Wreck-It Ralph wrecks your screen with vivid pixels, polygons and plenty of heart.","Leave it to Disney to produce an animation hosting one of the largest character rosters all from different intellectual properties, and yet not concede to obvious product placements. I see Sonic the Hedgehog in all of his ""you're too slow!"" glory, but never once feel persuaded to go out, buy the game and rage quit after failing Green Hill Zone Act 1. The focus is completely on Ralph's story. A villain from an arcade game grows tired of being the bad guy, and so drifts off into other games in order to prove that he can be the hero. However in doing so, his game risks being decommissioned, jeopardising the characters' lives in the process. It's a relatively simple story, an individual finding their purpose and not wanting to conform to their programmed design. Ralph's development is the most engrossing aspect of this film. Yes, the animation is gorgeous and fluid, as if playing 'Hero's Duty' at 60fps and in 4K. And yes, the voice acting is unsurprisingly fitting for all characters, particularly Reilly and Silverman. But the amount of natural change in Ralph as the film progresses is quite extraordinary. It's to be expected, however it irrefutably makes him an endearing character. As I mentioned earlier, intellectual properties can be spotted in every corner. Q*bert, Sonic, Bowser and a plethora of other famous creations, roam around the hub world acting as simple easter eggs for retro video game fans. Never once utilised to progress the story, just environmental details. It works as sufficient world building. The narrative structure however is somewhat fractured, with arcade games acting as genre shifts. 'Hero's Duty' provides the action, whereas 'Sugar Rush' enhances the story's sweetness. These shifts disable a lack of narrative flow, splitting the story up into different segments. The antagonist also felt unnecessary, and forcibly had a backstory just to quantify a plot twist. Still, another creative addition to Disney's animated resurgence. 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?' for the new generation.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Great concept but fell short. Even with all the kids in the audience, there wasn't a lot of laughing going on. The movie tried too hard to be funny.

Disney Magic Still Alive,"""Wreck-it-Ralph"" is a perfect example of the Disney magic. I took my three-year old son to see this film and it was the first time he sat still through an entire movie. I enjoyed how well the computer animation turned out and how well the traditional 2D characters like Ryu and Ken from Street Fighter turned out. It was interesting experience.The storyline didn't seem cluttered or overly long, which was good, you won't get bored with the film quickly (unless you watch it three times a day). While watching the film though, I wondered if the writers had drawn inspiration from an earlier Disney work, ""Tron""? I really enjoyed how the arcade games were incorporated into a film released during an age of Mobile Gaming as well, nostalgic for those of us who grew up with arcades. Also, I thought it interesting how the characters from the game used the surge protector as a subway system, that was ingenious thinking.I have also heard rumors of a sequel to this film already, based on platform gaming.

"A Masterpiece!! And, in my eyes, the Best Disney Movie EVER,by far!","Wreck-It Ralph is truly a masterful movie in history. There's absolutely no way it could be horrible. In fact Wreck-It Ralph is the only video game based movie to actually be a ""good"" one. Other video game based movies (like Super Mario Bros. and Alone in the Dark) are just BAD (Tron and it's remake were just decent). At first it seemed like kind of a joke (cause we all know video game movies SUCK), then when I saw it,it blew my mind!Wreck-It Ralph arguably has one of the best story lines in overall history (but I'll get into that a little later), with an incredible and downright funny script and amazing characters. The four main characters were outstanding and completely interesting, even their actors, John C. Reilly, as Wreck-It Ralph; Sarah Silverman, as Vanellope Von Schweetz; Jack McBrayer, as Fix-It Felix; and Jane Lynch, as Sgt. Calhoun. Ralph and Felix were extremely hilarious and had some of the most interesting quotes and lines in the entire movie, if some get cheesy after listening to them a lot. Vanellope was really cute and had quite an attitude for a 9-year old (sometimes being more like an adult or teenager than an actual kid what with her acting and IQ). And Sgt. Calhoun was tough in attitude, but a really charming character in my eyes. Even all of the voice actors were suited perfectly for each and every character, and some of the most notable ones that video gamers might notice from video games, like Sonic the Hedgehog's Roger Craig Smith. And some of the coolest cameos in gaming history, like Street Fighter's Ken, M. Bison, Zangief, and Ryu; Pac-Man & the ghosts; Mortal Kombat's Kano (known as Cyborg in this movie), and even Bowser (yeah, Mario was just TOO expensiveplus the creators just couldn't find anywhere to put Mario into the story, so instead his is just mentioned by Fix-It Felix, as well as Ralph mentioning Lara Croft).The one noticeable thing about the movie's graphics is that it's like combining the colorful environment of Toy Story 3 and the concepts of other video games in gaming like Fix-It Felix Jr. being based off the 1981 arcade game Donkey Kong (Felix can clearly be the Disney version of Mario while Ralph can play a Disney version of Donkey Kong; he's also inspired by other huge VG characters, like Mario arch nemesis Bowser), the first-person shooter genre for Hero's Duty, that also has concept and aspects very similar to the video game franchise Metroid, Sugar Rush's concept is like a cooler and really colorful landscaping of the board game Candy Land, and some other levels involving junk food you'd see in some video games. Though graphics get better and better every single year in computer animation, it's full of amazing detail and color, aside from top-notch animation, and it's one of the best graphical computer animated films, overall (if not as of today).Wreck-It Ralph's music is fantastic and I happily have to say it's not only my personal favorite, but one of the best ever Disney soundtracks (if not THE best). Songs like ""When Can I See You Again?"" (Owl City), ""Sugar Rush"" (AKB48), and even ""Wreck-It, Wreck-It Ralph"" (Bunker & Garcia) are some of the most memorable creations in music history (And Hero's Duty has an awesome Skrillex song; plus, it's the only I actually song I actually ""Like"" out of Skrillex), and the soundtrack is, once again, one of the best ever in the history of Disney. Sound effects in the game are suitable for everything in the environment of the movie, even the similar and most notable ones that Disney fans will ever notice entirely, like the ones Ralph finds in the box in a closet in the arcade game Tapper's. When it comes to voice acting, Wreck-It Ralph has one of the best ever in animated movie history (That's it).The story takes place in Litwak's Arcade were Wreck-It Ralph himself starts to get tired of and complains about his job as a bad guy in his game ""Fix-It Felix Jr."". 30 years later he points out and all of his miserable life in his own game at his first ever attendance at the Bad-Anon conference room with most of the other video game bad guys in the arcade (from other cameo arcade games), which is really the Pac-Man ghosts' space in the Pac-Man game, and about that day being the 30th anniversary of his game. Later during the anniversary party in the Nicelanders' building, things go out of control when Ralph accidentally crushes and splatters (or in his case ""wrecks"") the Nicelanders' anniversary cake during an argument with one of the Nicelanders about being treated nicely, since he's been treated like garbage all his life and having a medal for once to prove himself a good guy to them. Ralph must now set out to find his true destiny and prove himself to be a video game hero in the arcade and a good person (at least once) to the Nicelanders of his game, even if he doesn't have a medal with him to prove it.Wreck-It Ralph is an animated production that is all about perfection in filming. Sure, it does have a few flaws to it, but none of these ruin the movie at all. Even since the last Toy Story, as well as The Lion King, it can undeniably be called the best animated film of all time, at least to me. It's just what someone would want in a movie involving video games. If you haven't seen it, you have absolutely NO excuse. You gotta watch it. (And a little POA) Don't rent. BUY it!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Fun and engaging animation rich in comedy; adventure and dregrees of nostalgia.,"I am just about old enough to remember arcades and arcade machines themselves - there was an ""Outrun"" situated beside a ""Michael Jackson's Moonwalker"" near the reception desk of my local sports and leisure centre back in the mid 90's. Upstairs, in another the corridor, there was a ""Pac-Man"" game. On one particular holiday, an outlet known as 'SegaWorld' was situated not five minutes away around the corner of a hotel we were staying at. This was the only real video gaming arcade I think I ever visited: it was a vast, open gaming utopia of bleeping noises; flashing lights and huge screens. Shooting games would have in-built guns pointing at the screen, driving games (""Daytona USA"") would allow you to sit behind a wheel and actually simulate driving around the track. I distinctly recall being wowed by the fact multiple people could engage in the same race at once on different screens. That sounded like the most fun anyone could ever have doing anything.Not very long after all of this, Sony released their first 'Playstation' console and there was not, I do not think, really a reason to go back to arcades - I strain to recall going back to one after having obtained a Playstation myself, and I distinctly recall the arcade machines at my local leisure centre having vanished certainly by 2000. I can only guess no one was playing them anymore - Sega and Nintendo of course had certain consoles out when arcades were much bigger, but Sony just seemed to have seen the arcade off for good.All of which brings us to ""Wreck-it Ralph"", an actually quite infectious animation in the mould of ""Toy Story"", with spits and spots of ""Last Action Hero"" and ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" thrown in for good measure, about video game characters who live in arcade machines and operate within their own little universe parallel to our own. Like ""Toy Story"", they have their own rules and regulations on keeping everything a secret - it's a little more serious in this film because if game characters start misbehaving too badly, their arcade machine is shut down and wheeled off thus terminating everybody in the game. 'Work' is to fulfil what your character is meant to do within the confines of a given game - ANY game - and then chilling out in the evening ready for the next day. Sometimes, they use electricity cables to traverse to communal places, or even one another's games.John C. Reilly voices the eponymous Ralph, the villain in a fictitious arcade game from the 1980's entitled ""Fix-it Felix"", which still somehow manages to pull in the punters amidst all the cool new games. Ralph, however, wants change - he's tired of being the villain and is a little depressed on account of being rejected by the other characters in the 'Fix-it' game, whom will quite happily invite one of the Super Mario Brothers to a house-party, but never Ralph.Going against all the rules, Ralph bolts from the game in search of a medal, which he believes will win him the appreciation of the game's other characters given his nemesis Felix is showered in them every day for winning the very game Ralph must attempt to thwart. Facing oblivion should Ralph not return, Felix (Jack McBrayer) converses with the other characters of ""Fix-it"" and decides to follow him into a game resembling a combination of ""Mario Kart"" and those candy themed levels from ""Mickey Mouse's Castle of Illusion"" so as to drag him back... Eventually, events unfold whereby Ralph is wrapped up in a mission that threatens much more than his mere popularity.What is most impressive about the film is, aside from its dazzling visuals and really quite wonderful idea of creating a universe for video gaming characters to all co-exist, its sense of adventure and the careful characterisation it provides to an array of made-up video gaming entities, of whom cane be little; large; tough-talking; softly spoken; kooky; wacky and just plain homicidal - all of which creates a wonderful palette. Thrown in for good measure is a sweet romance sub-plot Felix has with a gun-toting action heroine from a ""Halo"" style shooter named Calhoun (Jane Lynch), which I assume was partly designed to highlight the progression female characters have undergone in video-games over three decades.The film's director, Rich Moore, has a background in working with people like Matt Groening on ""Futurama"" and ""The Simpsons"", and so is more than adept at delivering fast-moving, joke-riddled cartoons which are often very funny and seem to be about complete nonsense, but actually have very carefully defined boundaries that keep them from being such a thing.I think much of one's enjoyment of the film will derive from whether or not you can recall heading down to arcades and having a blast on a game, either with a friend or on your own. For many, those memories originate from childhood anyway and so there can be a really pleasing clash of nostalgia with the freshness of seeing an unseen adventure. The film is much more than mere visuals and effects, and certainly, the way everything is reigned in and brought together for the finale, is more than just slightly impressive. It isn't difficult to recommend ""Wreck-it Ralph"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Yet another cliched Disney movie,"You can guess the finish right from start. Everything is just predictable. Actually, this is just one of the ten movies Disney made every year for cash grab.

Abundance of lack of moral division,"I think that most people find it, rightfully so, very easy to sympathize with Ralph, because the part of society that's not bad guy is definitely as good as any discriminating and condescending gang of goats.

How the story goes and how the small information is captured all out the movie. You will be surprise for sure. My personal favorite for sure and deserves the Oscar.Vanellope is so cute and talkative, The voices of all characters are so amazing. It does not need to know the characters upfront. even i didn't know some characters. But it's always nice to see similar faces like street fighters etc.I will recommend this movie to anyone, guess what It was that good to convince me to register at IMDb and writer my first review about it. so If you reading this ""Don't worry your time with the movie will be awesome"" worth every second of it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Disney made it once again,"I had my doubts about this movie. Taken into consideration the lack any of good animation films lately and simply how low Disney sank, you can easily imagine why I had these.But I was blown away immediately. The story is complex enough - so it can appeal to younger audience - and told right. Same goes for directing. Though, I think by putting the new and old generation of gaming together, this movie can be enjoyed much more, if you are and adult, for there is a heavier emphasis on the ""old-school"".The main characters are simply stunning in terms of design and personality. This is not quite for the rest. Most of them are just pretty generic.All in all, this is fantastic movie. It has flaws, but not any major ones. I recommend this movie to anyone.

The Best Animated Film of the year,"Disney, taking a cue from Pixar, showed a short film before the screening of Wreck it Ralph. It was a cute mixture of different forms of animation, titled Paperman. A paper pusher runs into a woman on his way to work, everything in this world is black and white, like paper. Except for her lips, which are red. He is instantly infatuated with her and when a piece of paper blows onto her face, her red lipstick sticks makes a mark. He can't stop thinking about her and when he sees that she is in the building across the street, he decides to put all those papers to use. Cute, well thought out and conveys great emotion without a single word used.I hope every animated feature starts putting out shorts because it's a nice addition. Now, onto Wreck it Ralph. I'm in mid mid twenties, so the idea of retro game characters coming to life when the lights go out, think of Toy Story, appealed to me greatly. The first half of this film, I enjoyed immensely, it took me back to my childhood. The second half, my girlfriend enjoyed immensely, because everything was bright and colourful candy.Wreck-it Ralp is tired of being a villain. No one talks to the bad guys and everyone loves the good guys. Fix-it Felix earns medal after medal for beating the game and Ralph is tired of it. He wants his own medal, he wants to be part of the group. When he hears of another game, Hero's Duty, a first person shooter where you can get a medal, he game jumps. Something that is forbidden. When Ralph accidentally finds himself in an escape pod, with the medal and an alien creature from the game, it zooms out of the game and game jumps yet again, into Sugar Rush, a mario kart styled game where everything is edible. If he doesn't get back to his own game in time, it won't be playable and deemed broken. If a game is broken it gets unplugged, if it gets unplugged, the game characters have nowhere to go. Can Ralph get back to his own game in time to save himself and everyone else? Will the alien he was stuck with infect Sugar Rush? Can Ralph finally be a hero for once?All these questions are answered in this fully realized game that had me smiling from start to finish. Sure it tends to be more conventional as it goes on, but that didn't bother me because I was immersed in this world. You know screen you play on in the arcade? Well, the characters see it too, in fact they see you, the gamer, playing them. When the lights go out, they all go to game central, you'll see the likes of Sonic, Q-bert, Pacman, and many many more. Half the fun is looking in the background for cameo characters.Ralph is a character with one goal, become a hero. Clear cut, the characters he meets along the way help and hinder his goal. We follow him from point A to point B. As I mentioned before, the first half of the game will appeal to the older crowd, while the second half will appeal to the younger crowd. Characters make fun of the title Hero's Duty, so you know there is some potty humour involved.There are a lot of in joke references for the gamers out there. I won't reveal them because that takes away the surprise of it all. Suffice to say, Wreck it Ralph works. They set up the rules of their world and follow through on them. Everything mentioned at one point in the film has a purpose and comes into play later on. Nothing in the film is a throw away. That's why I enjoyed it so much.Kids will love it, specifically Sarah Silverman's character of Vanellope. Adults will like it because the story is well thought out and the comedy delivers. There's something for everyone in Wreck-it Ralph.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Tremendous,"The best American animated film of 2012, I think it's safe to say. Wreck-It Ralph (John C. Reilly) plays a video-game villain, a monstrous man who smashes a high-rise apartment every day while Fix-It Felix Jr. (Jack McBrayer), the hero, combats him and eventually gets him thrown off the building into a pile of mud. In the game's universe, this is just everyone's job. Ralph is sick of being the bad guy, though, and wants to win acceptance from the people who live in the apartment. The video game characters can leave their consoles and visit the other games, and Ralph decides to become a hero by entering a war game. Unfortunately, the havoc he wreaks there gets him thrown into another game where he wreaks even more havoc. This film is insanely clever, creating several different worlds with their own flavor. It's also just great at setting up plot points and twists without ever showing you its hand. Small bits that seem like only errant gags come back up later in surprising and brilliant ways. The characters are as well constructed as the plot. The two other most important characters are voiced by Jane Lynch and Sarah Silverman, as a sci-fi warrior and a pixie racer respectively. Silverman's character in particular is so wonderful, both adorable and annoying. Her character's relationship with Ralph becomes the emotional center of the film, and it packs almost as much of a wallop as Pixar's best works. The film is very much at Pixar's level throughout. It's really one of Disney's best movies, period. Huge congrats to Rich Moore, who follows in fellow-Simpsons veteran Brad Bird's footsteps in delivering a hugely satisfying feature film. Hopefully he'll give us another one really soon.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Wrecked Potential,"I recently saw Wreck-It Ralph as part of a long marathon of ""age appropriate"" movies for my nieces and nephews over the Christmas season. Contrary to my expectations, many of the children's movies were surprisingly good or even great as movies in their own right. On the other hand, movies like Wreck-It Ralph are exactly what I expected.While the premise is solid, the scenario is poorly plotted, the foreshadowing is weak, the characters are under-developed, the gags are not funny for either children or young adults, and the film ends without ever really delivering any kind of message or exploring a theme.There are severe pacing issues. The introduction overstays its welcome. Exposition is delivered at the wrong times making certain elements of the story annoying rather than mysterious. It fails to execute on the level of UP, Wall-E, the Lego Movie, or anything else I saw during the marathon. Actually, the botched execution is noteworthy-- there are scenes with so much unrealized potential.It could be praised for never relying on jokes that go above the heads of children, unfortunately, they just are not good jokes.I highly recommend you avoid ordering this if you're looking for some family friendly movie that everyone will enjoy. This is a much better movie for the ""stare at TV entranced without understanding the words"" crowd, and even then, some of the visual direction is likely to lose interest.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"""Wreck-It Ralph"" Review","""Wreck-It Ralph"" is a movie with a lot of underlying messages and themes. From accepting oneself to trying to reach for a better life, it has it all. There is even an underlying message of the blue collar worker becoming jaded with his life and wanting something more. Tired of being treated horribly just because his job isn't as glamorous as the next guys. It also builds on the theory that everyone has their place in the world regardless of how badly you maybe treated right now. It's all about dusting yourself off and trying to change the way the world sees you.The film is directed incredibly well. Every side story is handled with care and the same amount of detail as the main story so it doesn't feel tacked on. Characters are well highlighted and developed, showing their strengths and weaknesses. The visual gags are funny and it's incredibly fun trying to find your favorite classic video game characters. Writing is what makes this movie so enjoyable. It has smart and funny humor that caters to both adults and children. Never once talking down to it's audience. The film even uses pop-culture references in a smart and classy way to a point where it's funny. However, the movie doesn't rely just on the jokes to get by, there is a lot of heart in the story. The relationship between Ralph and Venellope is touching. There is a lot of emotional depth to the movie as well as many light-hearted funny moments and they're blended very well together.If you're looking for a bunch of classic video game characters strolling through the screen, well look no further, ""Wreck-It Ralph"" has them. They aren't as integral to the story as many would hope, but it's fun trying to find your favorites. Even though your favorite game characters aren't important to the main story, they help create a very fun and interesting world and they even get some funny moments.And there are plenty of references please the gamers.The real stars of the movie are Ralph, Vanellope, Fix-It Felix Jr, Sgt. Calhoun, and King Candy. All characters are great and they have their own time to shine. Ralph is a 9ft and 600+ lbs goliath with a quick temper, but a heart of gold. He is the every man and it's really easy to root for him. John C. Riley does a fantastic job of voicing the character and he knows how to balance the humor with the heart. Vanellope is a glitch in the game ""Sugar Rush,"" a Mario Kart-esque game, She is very sweet and cute. Some people might be annoyed by her voice, but the moment the character appeared on screen, I fell in love with her. Sarah Silverman does a fantastic job of voicing her and making an annoying voice incredibly likable. Jack McBrayer voices Fix-It Felix Jr, a goody to shoe. He's likable and some very cute moment with Sgt. Calhoun, voiced by Jane Lynch. Calhoun is a tough military leader and she has this incredibly tragic back story that is actually pretty hilarious. King Candy, voiced by Alan Tudyk, is king of ""Sugar Rush."" He's very reminiscent of the Mad Hatter in the way he speaks. He's a fun character to watch on screen.Animation is beautiful in this movie, some of Disney's best. The colors are bright and vivid, the different locations look unique and lush. It feels very much like a living breathing world. Each character also movies in a manor to their own game. And the use of music is excellent too. From the score by Henry Jackman to the music by various artists, they are all used incredibly well and only elevate every scene and moment. I love how each world had it's own sound.Overall, ""Wreck-It Ralph"" is an awesome movie that excels on every level. It has gorgeous animation with a great score to back up everything happening on screen. The characters are likable and the cameos are fun and entertaining. The jokes all hit along with the pop-culture references. Incredible direction and script elevate the movie to the stratosphere. Above all else it has heart. ""Wreck-It Ralph"" is the best animated movie this year and not only just that, but also one of the best films period of the year. Anyone can watch it and enjoy, it's not just for gamers. I give it 5/5, smart, witty, and fun with a lot of heart.Awesomeness",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Wreck-It Ralph,"The adventures of an arcade game villain who is fed up watching everyone else get rewards and medals whilst he is always portrayed as the baddie. ""Ralph"" decides that the time has come to abscond and try and emulate his pal ""Fix-it-Felix"" in the feel good, popularity, stakes. His first encounter is with the no-nonsense ""Sgt.

It's OK, this film. Perhaps gamers will get more from it, but I'm not a gamer so was rather unimpressed with the rather predictable messages of undervalued person seeking validation and affection in a cruel, uncaring, world. Some of the animation is great fun, it features a bit of Pac-man nostalgia and there is plenty of lively action packed into one hundred minutes of characterful storytelling - it's just that the story, for me anyway, was just thin and procedural and there is way too much dialogue.

Not Wiggum,"Did you ever wonder that maybe deep within the code of your video games that the actual world of the characters might really exist in some sort of Matrix-like universe? What if the personality coded into them gave them life? That's the premise of Wreck-It Ralph, a sort-of Who Framed Roger Rabbit for the video game generation.In a busy arcade filled with classics such as Pac-Man and Q-Bert (out of order) to modern kart racers such as (the fictitious) Sugar Rush, a humble Rampage clone called Fix-It Felix is nearing its 30th anniversary. During the night, when the arcade is closed, the characters from all the games come together in a hub located inside the power supply. Wreck-It Ralph, the antagonist of Fix-It Felix is feeling lonely and depressed at being treated like the bad guy outside of play-time and resents never being invited to parties. Tired of this alienation he takes off on a quest to gain trust, respect, and adoration by becoming a hero.True to his name, he just causes disaster, but soon meets another outcast in the glitchy form of Vanellope von Shweetz, a deleted character locked away in the code of Sugar Rush. They bond, and work together, and in this middle act the film sags, lurching dangerously close to Shrek territory, substitutes the video game culture the fans have been enjoying for candy-based puns, which feel like they belong in a different movie, and recycles the ancient ""be yourself"" moral that Disney has been milking for many decades. Vanellope is ultimately likable, but her appearance and personality is torn straight from the Pixar Book of Universal Character Clichés and Child Brats (the movie is actually a Disney production, but the comment still stands).Thankfully, the movie recovers and kicks into high gear for the final act. Ralph accepts his role as a villain within his video game and secures his status as a hero to the audience, up there with Baloo and the Beast. He IS similar to Shrek, but superior, and his is a superior movie.Video game fans will love the diverse range of characters featured here (Kano, Sonic, Zangeif - among many others) while all viewers will adore the beautiful color pallet and Henry Jackman's fun score. There's a lot of imagination here and, middle act aside, Disney have created a lot of potential for a very wide universe and franchise.

"""Wreck-It Ralph"" will appeal to gamers but might lose steam with other viewers","I don't play video games. Although I work at a store that specializes in movies first and video games second, I get the strangest looks from people when I tell them that. My first reaction is hand gestures that define how much of the store is made up of Blu-rays and DVDs in relation to video games. I didn't get the job there because of my love for video games. That's why I can't say I was all that excited when I saw the trailers for ""Wreck-It Ralph.""After 30 years of playing the bad guy in his own video game, Ralph (John C. Reilly) is ready to move on to bigger and better things. All he wants is to be accepted by the other characters of the game and be recognized as a hero instead of a villain for once. In order to prove he can be just as good as he can be bad, Ralph embarks on an adventure to other video game worlds to win an award and the respect of his associates. His journey pits him against the ruler (Alan Tudyk) of a racing game obsessed with keeping a glitching character named Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman) from participating.I'm more than positive that ""Wreck-It Ralph"" pleases gamers with its homage to video games past and present. The characters are all charming and filmmakers did a wonderful job capturing the looks of different types of old and new games. The only thing I couldn't quite get over was why Ralph and Felix looked so new, but their companions from the 30- year-old game still stuttered a bit when walking and talking.One thing that impressed me was how animators found a way to keep the style of the different characters consistent while being from different games and decades. Each game had a unique look but still somehow fit together in the grand scheme of the film. A good example of this was the blending of the vastly different ""Hero's Duty"" and ""Sugar Rush"" worlds.The voice cast for ""Wreck-It Ralph"" is an interesting mix of actors. Instead of the usual Disney TV stars and A-list celebrities we're used to, filmmakers dug a little deeper here. John C. Reilly (""Step Brothers"") lends his voice to the title character while Jack McBrayer (""30 Rock"") plays his nemesis, Fix-It Felix, Jr. Sarah Silverman (""Crank Yankers"") takes on the role of mischievous racer Vanellope von Schweetz. Jane Lynch (""Glee"") voices Sergeant Tamora Jean Calhoun from ""Hero's Duty."" It's quite a ""mature"" casting choice for a family film, but it works.Although being a bit complex for younger viewers, ""Wreck-It-Ralph"" will win children over with its mesmerizing animation and appealing characters. Its family-friendly fun which parents who used to play ""Pac- Man"" and ""Super Mario Bros."" can find something humorous in as well. However, it might not have the same appeal to those who never played video games.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Wreck on Ralph, Wreck On!","Disney has been busy this week with its business transactions. Not only have they just acquired Lucas' studio, but this weekend they decided to release their latest animated film Wreck-it-Ralph. For those of you without Disney Channel/ABC family watchers, or have missed the trailers before the movie, this is a film about video games. It starts out with a large hand, wild haired, bum look alike named Wreck-it-Ralph (John C. Reilly), who has been programmed to destroy a hotel complex that overtook his home. Fixing his path of rampage is a high pitched, repairman with a golden hammer named Fix-it-Felix (Jack McBrayer) who at the end of the day gets the glory, while Ralph gets the heave ho into the mud. Constant lack of Recognition though leads Ralph to leaving his game though, all in the pursuit of a token of glory he feels will change his life. So what did this reviewer think of this latest chapter in the Disney media? Read on to find outTo start my review off, I'll start with one of the movie's biggest strengths, the comedy. Many people who might be thinking, ""This comedy is just for gamers,"" are sadly mistaken in this viewer's opinion. Yes, there are plenty of video game references to please my fellow electronic players, many of which are cleverly integrated into the story to keep the film fun and exciting. References like Mario Kart, Metal Gear Solid, and Pitfall are thrown throughout the movie that will have any seasoned veteran laughing in their seats and perhaps even calling out the reference in the theater. However, if you're not that big on gaming, or have a very limited experienced in the game department don't worry there are plenty of other things to make you laugh. The writers of the movie filled most of the dialog with a load of puns that are both cute and clever. Many of these puns are jokes you've probably heard a thousand times when hanging out with friends, but for me they still made me laugh. Even the scenery and world design was quite punny, taking brand names of some products and turning them into environmental hazards and traps. Of course if you don't like puns, then this movie might annoy you after the sixth or seventh pun. However, for those who are young at heart like me, you won't be disappointed. Not a fan of puns, well there is one last humor style in this movie that may persuade you to see the movie, a style I call Sue Sylvester style. Those who love the hot-blooded cheerleader coach from Glee will be happy to see her essentially digitalized into this movie in the form of Calhoun the army leader. Out of the hallways and into the battlefield Calhoun insults every single game entity that crosses her path, crossing into the word cover up lines like pussywillows at times. If you're worried that her character will play a minor role in this movie, have no fears for Calhoun is in most of the movie.The other thing this movie has going for it is the cute fun adventure that was laid out by their studios. I found very little, if any slow parts in this movie, as the directing team kept the adventure fast and on the move going from world to another. Each of the worlds added another element to Ralph's character helping him discover the dormant hero sleeping inside of him. This adventure first has promise of dark, awesome action in the first person shooter world, which I can't lie I wanted to see more of. Once our team gets to Sugar Rush though, the cuteness floods out into the theater. Not only is the world itself a cute display of candy coated puns and Disney cartoon citizens, but it also unfolds the relationship part of the story between Ralph and Venelope (Sarah Silverman). The pint sized driver has some spunk to her lines, but also has the ability to melt your heart with big eyes and even bigger heart. Her character's background is a story of its own that integrates smoothly into the main plot, though it may bring a few awws out of you. Both stories have the same underlying message, and may even inspire you in some manner, either that or make you roll your eyes at being too cheesy. Despite the fun cuteness though and evolution of Ralph's goals, the story is still predictable lacking very few twists from the trailer. However, if you're taking kids to see it, or you're a kid at heart you might not mind it.What else is there to say about this movie? Again there is pretty good balance between the characters staying on the screen, which of course keeps the laughs fresh and new. On top of that the animation was very impressive for me. The characters moved based on their video games, such as the classic 8 bit blocky movements that were the precursor to modern games. What also made me happy was that I was able to follow all of the action scenes in this movie, instead of watching glitch filled, shaky camera shots that take away from the detail. Well at least most of the camera work didn't take away from the detail, unfortunately Hero's Duty was a little chaotic to follow and the brief screen time for the battle with the bugs was a little disappointing. Even the soundtrack was quite enjoyable and most of the songs fit perfectly with the scenes they were representing, especially Owl City's theme at the end.Wreck it Ralph is definitely a fun family film, and quite clever in many aspects. However, if cute and punny isn't your cup of tea, then you best sitting this one out for now. My scores for this movie are the following: Comedy/Family: 9.0 Movie Overall: 8.5",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
I enjoyed being hit in the face with this nostalgia wand of a film,"I found the conceit of the film to be quite brilliant as it set the stage for some very cool video game throwbacks which I absolutely loved. However I was often puzzled that these fairly obscure references were used in a film which employed some pretty juvenile humour (in particular when the Sarah Silverman character was involved).The look of the film is pretty spectacular with each world rendered successfully in different video game styles, in particular the candy land sequences which (here it comes) made me want to eat candy.The things that keep it from greatness are the usual trappings of an animated film with this budget, whereby they must hit all the necessary emotional beats and hold back from doing anything too narratively unusual. But in spite of this straightforwardness I did find myself a tad choked up in certain parts, so for what it set out to do the story's solid.Wreck It Ralph is an enjoyable romp with many a fun video game reference to be had and an economical and successful story that I can't imagine not appealing to many people, so check it out and be entertained, but not challenged.Also Ralph gets hit the face twice when the Rihanna song begins playing, I choose not to take this as a coincidence.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
The Best Animated Movie of the Year,"Ever since John Lasseter took over as the head of Dinsey's animation department, their CGI films have gotten a lot better. I'd actually consider Bolt and Tangled up there with some of Disney's Best works. And the same goes for Wreck It-Ralph, this is a funny, very exiting and likable movie that it should please everyone, not just gamers, and not just animation fans.Probably my biggest complaint isn't so much a problem in the movie, it's just a little disappointment as to what it was marketed as. I though Ralph would be going into a lot more games and meet many more classic game characters, but he really only goes into four, one only for a short gag, and the cameos only really appear in the first act. Most of the rest is nitpicking, some of the jokes aren't that funny, the romance between felix and the commander feels a bit forced, and the rest are just so small.I laughed quite a bit in this movie, going from small chuckles to LOLing. I loved the characters in this movie, the heros were likable and interesting, with some great backstory's and a few good twists along the way for some of them. The villain is funny and has quite the motivation, he is also very good at lying. The animation is fantastic, it seems to change with each game which is appropriate. The action scenes are fun, and the plot is deep without getting confusing. The cameos never take away from the story, and even though I'm not a gamer, I can tell you I enjoyed a lot of these cameos, so if you are a hardcore gamer, you will probably love this movie.Wreck it Ralph ranks up with some of Disney's best works, and it the best animated movie of the year. It's funny, exiting, has some good dramatic moments, has a great pacing, fun characters, and fantastic animation. There are some nitpicks I have, but that doesn't stop this from being a great movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Ah the video game movie simply about Video Games as a whole,"It sure is easier to make a decent movie out of Video Gaming, instead of one specific franchise. More or less the same power to bring viewers in, while little chance of underwhelming established fan-bases. Brilliant.I've seen it quite a while back now, and although i remember it had fun ideas and a decent story... really only the negatives stayed with me for this long, and that's not a good sign.Having Sonic on the poster because he's on a monitor explaining where to go for 3 seconds? R-e-e-e-a-lly?What the hell was that super cringe minutes long Tween Wave insert with the Gears of War-esque gang that's not aging this movie at all?

A very refreshing animated film with an imaginative and well implemented concept.,"I will be forthright, I was very aporetic towards the potency of this film when the concept was paraphrased to me. I simply couldn't previse any latent substance in apperceptive video game characters with fatalistic masquerades. However, the opening scene was quite the epiphany from my perspective. The film manages to effectively demonstrate its amenities and capture the interest of the spectator and adamantly refuses to relinquish it throughout the entire film.After observing the copious appearances of commonplace gaming entities such as, for instance, Pac-man; I had presumed that the film merely referenced them in order to execute a more demographic approach to captivating public interest in the film, however, this inclination was also erroneous. The film provides an evident obeisance to several more obscure characters as well, which I myself found convivial.The conflict of the film is also very poignant. The plot components are very subtle and gradually evince the juxtaposition between each occurrence to the viewer at applicable times.Overall, I would highly recommend viewing this film. I'm very content in finally viewing an animated film versatile enough for any age group to indulge.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Standard Disney Fare,"Disney sets a high bar though. The movie was good and entertaining but still, it was kind of forgettable. It had the usual Disney theme of ""love yourself, appreciate yourself for who you are, you don't need to be something you're not"", which seemed very familiar since I just saw ""Monsters U"" the other day. But when they pound on those poignant themes it always brings a tear to my eye. The movie has masterful use of classic storytelling and archetypes, as is expected from Disney. Gorgeous animation and CGI, from Disney it practically goes without saying.I have to complain though: Why did they pick Sarah Silverman of all actors, to do the voice of a cute little girl? When I heard the voice I immediately could tell it was her because it sounded so obnoxious and out-of-place. The voice of Ralph wasn't that great either, it reminded me of Barney Gumble.The movie starts out interesting, then has a boring lull in the middle, but then the ending it gets exciting again.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Went to see Toy Story and got Teletubbies,"I went to the cinema expecting a classic animated film such as Finding Nemo or Toy Story and was left bitterly disappointed!The comedy was lost on me in this one. I was left with the dilemma, sit and watch the end of this movie and be bored to death while missing my bus home or make a quick escape. I chose the latter.Don't get me wrong, I'm sure this will appeal greatly to young children of no older than 10, but anyone looking for anything more than a few childish jokes will likely be left very disappointed.I gave this 3/10 which is probably harsh but I've seen a lot of high ratings that don't seem accurate and wanted to even it out.",3.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A movie that really took me back to 1980's....,"These movies... animated movies... are so difficult to rate.Because they all take you places that don't really exist. How do you know it's a good movie when you have no frame of reference? Should you judge them for how they make you feel? Or the worlds they create? Either way - there's so much to enjoy about Wreck-it Ralph I really wouldn't know where to start.It's just so obvious when you love whatever it is that you do. And it's immediately apparent how much love everyone who was involved with the movie have for video games and animation. To say that Ralph's worlds were perfect would be an understatement - they are reinterpretations of the perfection that the original video games already were. There's one reason why Pac-Man, Q*Bert, Street Fighter, etc. are still in our collective consciousness - and that's because they did everything they could with the very limited resources of the time in the best way possible. But watching them, reinterpreted, on the movies is an awesome sight. ""Ralph"" shows an entire world where you can lose yourself into, looking for the smallest, tiniest detail you may have just missed.The story is pretty good and fun; the cameos by every video game character are fantastic, the animation is as stunning as anything. It's such a great movie I can hardly believe it comes from Disney, and not Pixar.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Wreck-It Ralph isn't just a home run, it's a grand slam!","As a 30-something father of two I can say that I absolutely loved this movie. This is really what you hope every movie experience will be like when you go to the theater. The homage to my favorite form of media and entertainment, classic video games, was just the frosting on the cake as this movie had real substance. The plot was wonderful, as it contained all the right elements of surprise, anticipation and suspense. The characters were delightful and the movie really drew you in to their plights and made you care about them and their relationships to one another.

I took the chance when my kids said they wanted to see the movie. I was not disappointed. It was a great movie and it has an awesome soundtrack which I had to buy. This is a movie for little and big. It has great humor for everybody and an emotional story too.It even has the curses that where made cute so kids would not hear them. I have to say, you should watch this movie if you want to have a good time with your kids, wife, girl or boyfriend, mum, dad or just anyone else.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Pixar who? 'Ralph' is one of the most creative and witty animated films in years,"For at least a decade now, the first name in animation has been Pixar, with the Disney half of that combination generally omitted. Pixar's dedication to the best storytelling in both written and visual form as well as incredible creativity and cleverness has generally gone unparalleled, but plain old Disney Animation show it's catching up fast with ""Wreck-It Ralph.""The concept behind ""Wreck-It Ralph"" owes a lot to the ""Toy Story"" movies that started the entire CGI revolution, but the level of complexity and creative world-building required by ""Ralph"" puts ""Toy Story"" in the bargain bin. Creating a world in which video game characters exist in a virtual network of arcade games after the arcade closes takes some serious ingenuity, which not only do director Rich Moore, writers Jennifer Lee and Phil Johnston and the entire creative team have in spades, but they keep their foot on the creativity gas pedal the entire time.Based on the genre's track record, an animated movie overflowing with this much artistic production design would likely fail in some fundamental aspect of the story, but ""Wreck-It Ralph"" wastes no time establishing Ralph as a character you sympathize with. The concept of a video game bad guy who has feelings and gets treated poorly because his job is to be mean fuels the emotional journey of the story from the opening minutes, though credit also to the writing and the voice work of John C. Reilly for making it such a convincing sell.After throwing Ralph this successful pity party, the film shows off its abundance of imagination and cleverness. As we see ""Game Central Station"" for the first time, essentially a power strip where the characters of every game can mingle, we get most of the film's famous video game character cameos. Because the film is still constructing this elaborate universe, we also get treated to several brilliant moments in which instead of traditional CGI, we will see a clip of the scene as if it were happening on an 8-bit arcade screen.The genius of ""Wreck-It Ralph"" in this regard simply can't be understated. It's easily the most creative and genuinely hilarious animated film since ""Toy Story 3,"" and if you discount that, then all of recent memory. Gamers will love the countless early references and most adults in general will find the beginning of ""Ralph"" to be the best part. The script clearly takes the strategy of dropping in most of the easter eggs at the front end so it can win audiences over quickly and focus on the core narrative in the later acts. At this point, the humor in the story also shifts to something more geared at kids, though it never stops pumping the creative juices.Determined to win a medal so he can prove to everyone in his game, ""Fix-It Felix Jr.,"" that he's a true hero, Ralph abandons his post as building-wrecker and searches for a way to prove himself (or just get his hands on a shiny medal). He sneaks into the first-person sci-fi shooter ""Hero's Duty"" and when that plan goes awry, he accidentally ends up in the candy- coated racing game ""Sugar Rush"" and becomes entangled in an entirely new conflict after ""Sugar Rush"" character Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman), an outcast in her game, steals his medal.The plot does get a bit complicated, but the film remains dedicated to its characters throughout and doesn't ever get too lost. Even Ralph goes from a character we pity at first to someone who's rather flawed in how he just wants to be treated like a hero rather than earn it. Naturally, the situation in the world of ""Sugar Rush"" provides the ultimate test for his character. He and Vanellope strike a deal so he can get his medal and so she can win a spot as a starting racer in ""Sugar Rush"" despite being a glitch in the game.Setting the majority of the later half of the movie in the candy world of ""Sugar Rush,"" the creativity comes in the form of creative junkfood jokes such as donut cops and an abundance of candy puns, as well as Ralph and Vanellope exchanging childish insults. It can get overbearing, but something clever and hilarious lies in wait around every corner to cancel the cheesy stuff out.The sheer force of this film's vision and inventiveness has the power to mask pretty much any knock you might consider holding against it, and it doesn't substitute creativeness for visual quality either. ""Ralph"" looks excellent, with props to the way that film's retro arcade characters move like 8-bit game characters despite being in CGI.""Wreck-It Ralph"" doesn't quite have the same degree of heart as Pixar's best offerings, but considering the extremely commercial nature of the concept, the fact that it does pull heartstrings at all is something that will make you think even less of films like ""Cars 2."" Ralph's arrival at self-realization has somewhat of an obvious trajectory, but it's not as clear cut as the moral lessons presented in most animated movies. There are some powerful turns in the emotional narrative that you don't expect from a movie that combines the shooting of deadly alien bugs and little tween-age girls driving edible race cars.Ultimately, ""Wreck-It Ralph"" offers something we just haven't seen (outside of ""Toy Story"") since the dawn of the CGI era: a near-perfect merging of the somewhat mindless and shiny commercial appeal common in lesser family films and the creative and visual brilliance and committed storytelling of the genre's absolute best.~Steven CThanks you for reading!

Well Put Together,"As is the case many times, the release of a sequel prompts the reviewing of the prior movie(s).I'd seen Wreck-It Ralph six years ago or so but I needed a refresher before watching the sequel with the kiddies. Wreck-It Ralph is solid movie much like Toy Story except the video game characters come to life in the absence of humans. It's neat and nostalgic as we're treated to characters like Pac-Man, Ken, Ryu, Zangief, Bowser, and others.The story itself was very well thought out and formatted. The humor was a bit lacking though they tried. Wreck-It Ralph may have been the name but it was well put together.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Hilarious and filled with genuine emotion,"I went to the theater with my friend, with the intention of seeing Skyfall. However, upon finding out that all showings of Skyfall had been sold out, and that the next theater we went to wasn't even playing it, we settled on Wreck-It Ralph, since we had both also been wanting to see it. I went in with high expectations, and the film did not disappoint--in fact, in exceeded my expectations.The story, while it seems rather formulaic as a kids' animated movie, is really quite good. The writing is solid and provides the audience with an excellent understanding of just about every character. The film, thankfully, is not predictable and actually kept me guessing towards the end.The characters themselves are incredibly likable. Ralph isn't exactly the archetype hero, but we are shown that despite his tall height and short temper, he's really a good guy. Fix-It Felix and Calhoun provide some excellent comic relief. Jane Lynch's voice acting is superb. But the real gem of the film is Vanellope, who is probably the most adorable thing I've ever seen. It's simply impossible not to like her.Wreck-It Ralph is as good as it gets. With an amazing cast of characters, bright animation, and a story that's filled with genuine emotion, this movie melted away all my masculinity. I haven't teared up this much at the end of a movie since Toy Story 3. I cannot describe this movie any other way except to say that it is perfect.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Wreck-It Ralph,"Nostalgia has been digitized. In the arcade game universe of Wreck-It Ralph, a pixelated array of characters (both copyrighted and fictional) mingle each day after the last quarter is over. But for Ralph, the bulldozer-handed villain of '80s arcade relic FixIt Felix Jr., life isn't just about bonuses and extra lives. An 8-bit bully with a heart of gold, Ralph (perfectly voiced as a butcher's dog by John C. Reilly) runs away from his game to prove to the world that there's more to him than just being bad. Like Fix-it Felix Jr. Fixit (Jack McBrayer) and a Spatial Space Soldier (Jane Lynch), Ralph ends in running sugar, a racing game in a wonderful country of Cotoncassian clouds.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Watch-It Now,"When the lights go off at Litwak's Arcade, it's just the end of another day on the job for all the video game characters. Like any working stiff after a days work, they go home and party, visit friends, chill at a bar. Using Game Central Station, characters can leave their own game and live their lives until the Arcade reopens the next day. One such life is that of Wreck-It Ralph, the ""villain"" in the game ""Fix-It Felix Jr"". Having become disenfranchised with never getting the love and recognition the ""good guy"" does, Ralph decides to leave his game and enter another game to win a medal hoping that doing so would finally win him acceptance among the other characters in his game. He journeys through Game Central, to a ""First person shooter"" game called ""Hero's Duty"" where he unwittingly unleashes a ""psy bug"" virus into another game, a kart racing game called ""Sugar Rush"". Along the way, he interacts with well known video game characters, unwillingly causes a near disaster, uncovers a hidden conspiracy and finally finds acceptance in a most unlikely friend.Wreck It Ralph is to video games what Toy Story is to children's playthings. The story itself feels familiar; we've seen variations of this family friendly, all ages appeal type of story in many previous films from Disney and pixar, just in a different narrative setting. Yet director Rich Moore (better known as director of many Simpsons episodes) present this tale in an ingenious and fresh way. He cleverly uses the CGI format to tap into the boundless imagination and joy that one finds in video gaming. Some of the characters even move in that jerky fashion as seen in old games and designs span the whole gamut of evolving styles from cartoony retro to stylised modern. There is a smart play on irony here too: real life gamers play games to escape, to become another character that they are not in real life, and yet the characters themselves are unable to do that since they are programmed to be who they are and nothing can change that. Escape from reality is precisely what Ralph tries to do.Key to the appeal of the movie is it's characters. Although lacking in ""A-list"" Hollywood cast members, the voice acting is top notch. Every role is infused with that much personality and emotion that, like any good movie, you forget about actors or their roles and just see these characters as characters. Ralph himself is very easy to relate to; the outcast misfit trying to gain acceptance and to come to terms with a purpose for which to use his talents. Not surprisingly, this sounds like the stereotypical profile of the big sized socially inept gamer boy. Another perspective is that he represents the adult reality; a working stiff who has grown jaded of his job and just wants to escape into another game world. Along the way he meets the annoying Venelope Von Schweets who is the very definition of the word ""brat"". Yet Venelope herself is a character with many layers and below the rude bratty exterior lies a little girl who, like Ralph, just seeks acceptance for who she is. her happy go lucky nature easily represents the inner child without a care in the world yet forced to grow up under less than ideal circumstances. Ralph and Venelope play off each other with perfect chemistry, allowing for one truly heart wrenching scene near the movie's climax.Cheeky pokes on video game genre stereotypes and at how gaming has evolved through the years. From the simple pleasures of 8-bit platformers to cutsey kart racers to high definition badass First Person Shooters (FPS). Even the characters within those games are parodied. For example, Sgt Tamora, a character in the FPS Hero's Duty gets a tragic backstory so common in such characters. Fix It Felix Jr speaks in an overly polite style with dated slang, further highlighting his game's retro status. Special mention goes to the music score by Henry Jackman who combines orchestra with electronic synths. It goes from a purely electronic simple melody for the retro games, segues into j-pop inspired tunes for the candy inspired Sugar Rush kart game and even lampoons the heavy metal style music in science fiction FPS games.There is something truly nostalgic here and it is just oozing from the art style, the music, the very concept of the show. The film's only shortcoming is it's animation which looks surprisingly mediocre considering it's 165 million dollar budget. Perhaps a lot of the money went into buying the rights to use characters in cameos like Zangief and Bison from Street Fighter, Sonic the Hedgehog, PAC Man, and other famous video game characters. Another let down is the misleading advertising campaign. Posters and wallpaper featuring all these famous characters walking next to Ralph, or even featured more prominently than the true main protagonists, implying that their role in the film will be a substantial one. Alas, all we get are cameos that never last beyond a minute.Yet something about the story just tugs on the heartstrings of the inner child. Gaming adults and pop culture enthusiasts will have a thrilling time picking out all the little references and homages while children and children at heart will be amazed by the colorfully creative repackaging of a familiar story. The game world is a world of unlimited potential. Who knows if we might see Ralph, Venelope and their friends move beyond the arcade and into the world of internet Cyber gaming! Now THAT calls for a sequel and fast!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Pure Video Game Magic,"First, a disclaimer: I consider myself to be a relatively moderate Disney animation fan. Sure, there are the great classics (e.g., ""Snow White""), the modern classics (""The Emperor's New Groove"") and the occasional underrated film (""The Rescuers Down Under""). But for the last decade or two, Disney movies have been more miss than hit... (three words: ""Mars Needs Moms"". What?)Now, let me point out that video game movies have an even worse track record. I mean, let's be honest: nobody waxes eloquent about ""Wing Commander"" or ""Tomb Raider"" (daydreams about Lara Croft not included). The best we've gotten was occasional flashes of brilliance followed by intense disappointment... ""Tron: Legacy"", anyone?So on the whole, the idea of combining Disney animation with video games seemed fundamentally flawed, if not outright doomed.And yet, it works. It works really, surprisingly well. The cleverness is obvious: making the film around several ""familiar"" games that didn't really exist means the directors and screenwriters weren't hampered by the storyline baggage of imitating real game. Obviously, talented screenwriters and animators played a big part. It's such a relief, after this year's travesties like ""Prometheus"", to see a script that doesn't contain any large plot holes and actually builds on itself to advance the plot instead of relying on characters to bumble around randomly.And yet the real brilliance of it is even more. Jerry Rees (director of ""The Brave Little Toaster"", perhaps the saddest children's movie ever made) said in a recent interview that ""fables have always been a way to move through our darkest fears to a place of hope"". ""Wreck-It Ralph"" works because the stakes feel both dire and real. That even though we're laughing at the main character and his friends telling stories at a ""Bad Guys Anonymous"" meeting, we feel his pain at being ostracized by the people he cares about. And we share his desire for a better life. Who wouldn't, after doing the same dead-end job for 30 years?And unlike ""Tron Legacy"", which built up an interesting world, but then really didn't do anything with it, ""Wreck-It Ralph"" feels real because of the way the characters behave and interact. A quick scene in the movie showing Ralph giving some food to a homeless, ""unplugged"" Q*bert almost brought a tear to my eye. And if you don't consider that to be movie magic, then I'm afraid I can't help you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Absolutely Brilliant.,"Yes, I loved this because it had all the video game heroes from when I was growing up, but this film is so inventive, stylish and complete, it is hard not to like it. The characters are great and the voice actors are absolutely brilliant. The humour is top notch and I laughed constantly, even more so than my 6-year-old, who also loved this entertaining film. Some say it has a dip in the middle, but I disagree. Without losing any of Disney's sentimental touch, the film moves along very nicely through flamboyant colours and excellent (gaming) worlds and leads to a very fulfilling, if somewhat predictable ending, but there is a nice twist thrown in, just to spice things up. Overall, it's a film that manages to take a brilliant idea and do a lot with it. Of course, you have the standard morals and emotion linked with any Disney film, but that's the whole point. The product placement actually works really well, though kids wouldn't understand that side of the humour. Anyone who says this is not a good film needs to grow-up. Irony? Well, of course it is. :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Fun at the arcade,"With some unabashed nostalgic throwback into the glory days of arcades, writer-director brings Rich Moore brings one of the most charming, if somewhat generic, animated movies in a while. The movie focuses on video game villain Wreck-It-Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly) - referencing the Donkey Kong barrel throwing gorilla - is tired of being the odd man out in his world, constantly thrown off the top of the building by the hero Fix It Felix (Jack McBrayer) and the apartment house inhabitants. Forced into solitude, living in a dump on the outskirts of the video-game, Ralph hopes for a change in fortunes, aspiring to become a liked and cherished character. In search of glory he decides to jump game into a first player shooter ""Hero's Duty"". A sequence of events however has him crash land in the kart racing world of ""Sugar Rush"", where he meets Vannellope (Sarah Silverman), an apparent glitch computer character, whose sarcastic wisecracks seem at odds with the sugar-coated wonderland in which she lives. Here Ralph finds a close affinity to the outcast girl and attempts his best to aide her in winning the go-kart race. Here however they must first overcome the flamboyant mad-hatter King Candy (Alan Tudyk), the kooky leader of this game world. Meanwhile the goodie-two-shoes Felix ventures out of his game in order to bring back their sole villain, soon finding aide in ""Hero's Duty"" commander Calhoun (Jane Lynch).Albeit not a classic, ""Wreck-It-Ralph"" has enough wit, humour and magic to make it a fun re-watchable dash into the past of arcade games glory days, together with guest appearances by Pac-Man, Sonic the Hedgehog, Q*Bert or Dowser. The overall concept of computer characters lounging out of their computer game worlds after the arcade closes, much like toys coming to life when the child is outside of its room, brings about some novel ideas, like a support group for villains struggling to accept their endless role as a baddie. Possibly the most intriguing is the use of animation, where each game has its own specificity with rigid, jumpy animation in the outdated Fix-It-Felix to the ultra-realistic realm of the ""Call of Duty"" rip-off. Most of the movie takes place in the ultra-colourful candy-land realm of the go-kart racing, gloriously over-the-top, ultra-sweetened, but with characters contradicting the external niceness of the game (instead full of vindictive, insensitive racers and its conniving king).Through this internally contradictory exposition come most of the enjoyment the movie has to offer, even though the general plot heads into strikingly predictable territories once the initial premise becomes clear. Therefore, ""Wreck It Ralph"" becomes a bit of a hostage to the clichés it incorporates (story-wise as well as character-wise, as referencing is the name of this game), placing its strengths strongly on the shoulders of the dedicated worlds, computer game homages and several well drafted subversive characters (with Vannellope the stand-out). The satire brought about by endless clichés and references does wear thin making the inside jokes tiresome and entirely predictable at length, but thankfully that is not the only thing going for the movie and the nostalgic qualities will definitely hit home with most seasoned gamers.Of note, there are several moments of on-screen brutality, which may make parents uncomfortably squirm, while corner-checking out the reaction of their kids, as well as a few cumbersome inadequate jokes not suited for the target audience.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Not only for gamers but everyone,"To all the kids who were born in the 70s and 80s (or some early 90s), arcade games are so popular. Even though they played them regularly or not, they are still there in everyone's minds. When they watched Wreck-it Ralph, I think that all that ""kids"" will not able to hold back their memories of Pacman, Mario, Fix-it Felix... And that is the reason why people keep telling me that movie is for gamers only. And just because of that reason, I didn't watch the movie earlier, which makes me regret. I don't know many characters in the movie, only Mario, Pacman and guys in Street Fighters. Due to my shortage of knowledge, I realized more than just a memoirs of game characters. Everything has its two-sided and once people spotted your bad manner, they will always judge you as a bad guys. It's OK, whatever, the person who is deep inside you is much more important. You are bad and at least it's good because you know who you are :)",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
It's a good movie.,"Some friends saw it and told me it's too Disney-esque. Now that i saw it i would say that's not really the issue here. True, from a gamer point of view it falls a little short on paying tribute to the idea. After the first half hour the video game references are used up, which was a little disappointing. But from a movie point of view it's definitely one of the better animation movies i've seen.This is mostly due to the clever script. It tells the story of two outsiders unwillingly joining forces to archive their dream of being accepted for what they are, each in their own respect. For a recent Disney movie it deals with quite some serious topics like loneliness, peer pressure and social exclusion. And it handles those as respectful as possible in the sugar-sweet environment it takes place.Finally the mandatory happy end kept on the saner side of kitsch, which is already a lot to ask nowadays. So yea, this movie is definitely worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
This Movie Is A Wrecker! :),"If you like video games, or if you played any kind of a video game anytime in your life, this is a movie that you will most likely love. Various characters from famous titles live in their own game worlds and when the Arcade room is closed at nights, something that most players never thought about happens. You will see several cool references about video games in the movie that will make you smile, that will make you remember that moment in your childhood when you were having so much fun pushing some buttons in a device that brought you into another universe while you were just sitting there. Other than these, Wreck-It Ralph also carefully speaks about friendship and encouragement for both young viewers and elders.

The Vidiot Reviews,"Wreck-It RalphThe worst part of being a video arcade villain from the '80s is that you got paid in sullied quarters.However, the retro rogue in this animated feature only wants to be paid in gratitude.Tired of his job as the baddie in the Fix-It Felix, Jr. (Jack McBrayer) game at the arcade, Wreck-It Ralph (John C. Reilly) makes a pact with the game's populace to prove he can win a medal like Felix.To do so, Ralph abandons his game and finds himself in a coin-operated Candy-Land kart-game, where he befriends a glitch (Sarah Silverman) with racing aspirations.Meanwhile, Ralph's own game is in danger of being unplugged.Despite its dips into EC rating territory, Ralph's astounding animation, thorough storytelling and cavalcade of 8-bit icons secures it a high score.Sadly, the only arcade-type appliance Ralph could crawl into nowadays is a Sex and the City themed slot machine.Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A missed opportunity full of formulaic cliché.,"I'll keep this brief. I grew up in and help create the arcade generation, and so I had high hopes for this movie. Sadly it seems they could only afford a couple of licenses so most of the games are made up or obscure. There are so many games that should have been in there (reply with your lists!) but instead you get a version filled with apparent 'Chinese knock off' games.Why is that important to this film? Well, frankly it is the weak script and writing. It is all so standard nowadays and I saw so few deviations since the first CG kid movies coming out started. You can apply this formula to almost any kids movie in the last decade:1. Loser needs to prove self. 2. Loser has love interest. 3. Loser gets quest 4. Loser disappoints everyone. 5. Loser redeems self. 6. Happy ending with pop music.(Try applying this formula to any CG film and you'll see it fits quite well)Seriously, are the writers in Hollywood THAT lame now? For God's sake, somebody do better than this garbage so another country deserves the profit for a change.Other than that all the cast do a great job and the animation is of course top notch (I must admit that at least). The actor choice for our soldier girl was simply perfect :PAs for the Arcade games, I would have wanted (in no order):1. Pole Position 2. 1942 3. Prison Break 4. Star Wars 5. Asteroids 6. Space Invaders 7. The Phoenix 8. Scramble 9. Gyrodine 10. Hard Drivin' (EDIT - #11. R-Type! How could I forget that?! Okay, you could have had the bug monster from it or something.... Maybe #12. Operation Wolf too....)Mind you... I am just wondering if I am assuming that I was in the arcades when the games in the movie appeared... Why would kids today relate to things in my 80's childhood?

Wreck It Ralph,"PLOT: An arcade video game character known as Wreck-It Ralph becomes disappointed with his life and that he is always known as a ""bad guy"". He decides to leave his game and jump between other titles in order to win a medal and return to his game a hero.MY THOUGHTS: What drew me into this film the most was the fact that its story is one of the most creative and original ideas I have ever seen in a movie like this. It was done really well and made it feel like there is really a living, breathing world behind all those arcade screens.PROS/CONS: The movie was very well done. Its very colourful and the fact that it takes place in various different video game worlds keeps its fresh and interesting as you watch. The only nitpick I may have is that it spent too much of its run time in ""Candy Rush"" (a candy land style racing game). In my opinion, too much time and it made me want him to jump to even more games.RATING: 8/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Wreck-It Ralph is not innovative in his concept, but still manages to be the best movie ever made inspired by the video game universe","While Pixar invaded Disney territory and created the redheaded princess and Brave, Disney Animation was making its Toy Story. However, instead of the toys that come to life when no one is looking, Wreck-It Ralph (Wreck-it Ralph, 2012) shows what video game characters do after the last game over of the day. Wreck-It Ralph looks like an ode of love to a generation from the era of nostalgic arcades and we are introduced to games of very few bits, with those ""square circumferences"" and a very high degree of difficulty, which made us hammer the controls until the hand bleed and ask for money to our parents to the point of driving them crazy (or impoverishing them, whichever came first).Connected by means of the electric network, the characters of the games interact with each other during their free time in activities as diverse as having drinks at a bar and help group meetings, in the best Alcoholics Anonymous style. And it's in the (not so anonymous) villains support group that we meet the title character. For 30 years, Ralph has been the antagonist in the game ""Fix-it Felix Jr."", where his job is to destroy the poor residents' condominium, while Felix, the good guy, fixes everything. After working hours, the poor big guy goes to sleep in a garbage dump full of the bricks of the detonated building recently repaired. An outsider in his game and feeling despised by everyone, Ralph ends up ""changing"" his game after a medal that would prove that he can be a hero. In this, he ends up in a violent FPS (first person shooter) and also in the sugary environments of ""Candy Run"" (a copy of ""Mario Kart""), where he meets the small and frisky Vanellope, considered a bug in that game's system. However, Ralph's personal endeavor in search of recognition and self-esteem ends up putting the entire arcade at risk.The main concern in making a story that goes deeply into a nostalgic past is to know if it is capable of grounding itself beyond the collage of references, an element that always pleases the public. And the quickest answer to this question is yes, the film is successful. Directed by Rich Moore (veteran director of TV animations such as the great ""Futurama"", ""The Simpsons"" and ""The Critic""), the film gives us a fascinating universe right away. In an arcade where modern and more vintage games are available for gamers, the fun really begins after closing time.The development of the plot follows the structure of other drawings of the studio: part of a displacement of the central characters, producing a story of conquest centered on the idea of never abandoning oneself or giving up on dreams. The difference is that, rooted in a nostalgic story, with charismatic characters, the repetition of the argument should not be seen as a problem, but as a primordial basis for several animations that, if well told, are efficient for composing a good film. Even if you don't want to compare or compete, Wreck-It Ralph is more successful in his proposal than Valente, the Pixar animation that fails due to a simplistic script, such as an attempt to strip off deeper layers, so characteristic of the studio of the luminaire.Wreck-It Ralph shows some evident signs of these new times, but still he owns a traditional morality and a plot formulated within basic and somewhat aged concepts. Moore and his team find great visual outputs to show how these ""dolls"" of games are extremely different from each other, like the primitive ""Pac-Man"", the 8-bit platform game ""Fix-it Felix Jr."", the super-colorful "" Candy Run ""and the modern (and fictional) FPS"" Duty of Hero "", manage to coexist. Even the design of the characters finds the right balance to style these well-known figures without detracting from them. The virtual world of the feature allows game characters to interact much more complex than that seen in the three ""Toy Story"", even because they occur in environments and situations that give screenwriters greater freedom in the creation of the internal rules of the arcade, a privilege well exploited. And the very special appearances of figures like Sonic, Zangief, Ryu, Ken and Bowser will make the party of gamers.The idea of a plant in which all these characters live together is a great idea, and the very dissatisfaction of the evil boy - who is only so for having been conceived in this way - with his condition and his search for acceptance is a easily shared feeling, that anyone can identify with. On the other hand, that no one is totally good or bad we know, but wouldn't it be precisely in this contrast that most fairy tales are built? On his journey, Ralph comes across little Vanellope, a bug that exists only to disrupt the development of the Sugar Rush game. The brunette girl with big dark eyes is another find, even though her irreverence and impertinence don't persist for long. Soon we have only one needy girl also looking for a place in the world. She practically steals the show in her adorable, comical way.In addition to having a personal story that at various points connects her with Wreck-It Ralph, Vanellope guides the plot as if she were the real protagonist. This is not necessarily a bad thing. The character overflows with charisma and on top of that it serves as a moral guide for him to understand his own hero journey. Both suffer from being marginalized by their differences and learn that the path to happiness lies precisely in embracing nature itself instead of rejecting it. And like Dumbo, Pinocchio, Ariel, Mulan or Quasimodo, among many others, all she and her new friend will need is someone who accepts them as they are - even if, for this, they themselves need to change their ways of being and Act.One of the big dilemmas today is the lack of satisfaction of most people with what they do, making it easy for the public to connect with Ralph's journey. The same thing happens with Vanellope's search to assert his own identity. In this, the audience is able to understand their existential journeys and how these characters' dialogue with each other from an emotional point of view, something fundamental to the success of the film. The chemistry between the two works well and even masks some embarrassing dialogues, like the inevitable pun on certain bodily functions. There is also, in parallel, the development of a messed-up romance between the straight guy Felix and the tough guy Calhoun, from ""Duty of Hero"", while they try to remedy Ralph's messes. There are also well-positioned ""tracks"" about the film's villain and the final duel is really exciting. But it is a pity that, slowly, the film leaves its singular universe a little and concentrates too much on the ""Candy Run"" environment. In addition, the conclusion of the story itself glorifies a stratified society with fixed roles, in a bizarre moral lesson, almost as strange as the one present in the mediocre ""Cars 2"".Although quite predictable in the course of his dramas, the story is full of easter eggs. They range from the ""special participation"" of famous characters from real games (some of them historical, like the Q * Bert and the Pong bars), to situations that children may not understand yet, but adults will have fun. This is the case, for example, of the giant Coca Diet lake covered with Menthos stalactites, the ""cheat"" codes, the first-person player, etc. In varied scenes, we can find cameos from Sonic, Pac-Man, Street Fighter characters, Mortal Kombat and much more. Another highlight is the games created for the film. While the game Fix-it Félix Jr was inspired by the classic Donkey Kong, Hero's Mission reference to first person games like Call of Dutty, already Candy Run reminds us of the memory of Mario Kart. It is a funny and moving journey of self-acceptance by our protagonists, where each one must understand that they have a role to play and that, however small or more unpleasant it may be, they have importance and must be recognized. The film earns points (no pun intended) for passing on its message in a tender and sincere way, without seeming to be a ""moral of the story"" played out haphazardly by the filmmakers, as well as for the respectful and nostalgic treatment of the video game universe.Wreck-It Ralph is not innovative in his concept - as has been said, it is a vision very similar to a Toy Story. Nor is it original in its theme - game adaptations have been appearing in theaters since Mario first came in the pipe. But it still manages to be the best movie ever made inspired by the video game universe. It is proof that, yes, it is possible to develop characters, parallel plots and fantastic worlds in cinema and still leave the audience with a desire to play, I mean, to see more. Rich Moore's film is an animation that deserves to be seen and reviewed, either for the references that awaken the feeling of nostalgia or for the fun. As if that were not enough, there is still the bonus of being thrilled as an authentic heroic journey. Therefore, it is not for nothing that at the end of the projection the public feels like continuing this game indefinitely.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
This Film Wrecks a Path to Your Heart,"I know what you're thinking. Why does this film warrant a full 10 stars from me? Well I'll be honest, if you don't like video games, this film will probably just be a 6 or 7 to you. But if you do - this film has it ALL.Me and a friend saw it in 3D and it was nothing to sneeze at, but I'd recommend the Blu-Ray version - the colors are very crisp and you can see the detail in every character and environment (a crucial helper for spotting references, believe me, you're gonna need it)The film is the basic bad guy existential crisis plot that's been covered by a few other films, but not to this unique and well-developed angle.The hero/villain travels to 3 different game cabinets, and the animators managed to make each game look completely distinguished, but connect the emotion and plot progression through each. (Fix-It Felix Jr. With pixels/voxels and limited frames of animation; Hero's Duty with sharp angles, colors and sound; and Sugar Rush with pure food porn - you want to reach out and take a bite out of every ""rock"" and ""tree"")The voice-acting is top-notch, especially by The main cast and Alan Tudyk, reminding me of a certain Hatter with his performance.This movie also struck a chord with me on a personal level. I was born into the gaming world, and recognized most all the nods to our culture that even most TV shows get wrong. It really made me feel connected to the characters and universe, and made me really care about the story. Toy Story was for the 90s kids what Wreck-It Ralph is to the 2000s.This movie contains two visual references to alcohol and minimal cartoon violence.I'd recommend Wreck-It Ralph to all ages and all genders if they like video games.

A triumph,"Wreck-it Ralph is without a doubt one of the best animated films of the last few years. Though advertised as the ultimate love letter to video games, it's actually more of a story about identity and redemption that merely happens to take place in the world of video games. Though that's not to say there aren't tons of references to video games both old and new, and they will definitely keep hardcore gamers satisfied. The references are handled tastefully, and the film never feels like pandering to a specific audience though obscure references and inside jokes.The characters are truly what makes the film work. Ralph's dissatisfaction with his life is understandable, but it's never made black and white that he would be right and everyone else wrong. Sarah Silverman's character Vanellope starts out as annoying and hyperactive, but eventually grows on the audience. There is one genuinely tragic moment between Vanellope and Ralph that almost had me in tears. The supporting characters are also well handled, and Sergeant Calhoun in particular makes an odd case of being so much more than what she's supposed to, i.e. a brutal parody of the ""badass chick"" trope seen in many video games. But she actually has depth to her.The movie is also side-splittingly hilarious. Though getting the references gets you slightly more laughs out of the film, most of the comedy is universally understandable. The visuals are breathtakingly beautiful, and the landscapes in ""Sugar Rush"" (a racing game where most of the film takes place) show some true imagination and inventiveness. Mentioning that the voice acting is superb feels almost pointless. This is Disney we're talking about, after all. Towards the end there is a surprising twist I honestly did not see coming, and those are always a plus.If one would want to search for gripes in this movie, the biggest one would probably be its length. It's not too long, about a 105 minutes, but towards the end you may start thinking when the movie is truly going to end. There's also quite a lot of rules the film has to establish in order to make the world make sense, but they don't take up too much time.But aside from those, I can find very little to criticize about Wreck-it Ralph. This is quite simply a masterpiece of animated cinema, and I definitely hope to see this particular world explored more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Irresistible and really quite clever,"With 'retro' very much in fashion these days, and the children of the late 1980's and 1990's now reaching an age where one can get nostalgic about one's childhood, it is the perfect time for there to be a film that harks back to early games consoles. After all, consoles such as the NES, Sega Mega Drive and the SNES, although now very amateur when compared to recent incarnations, were the godfathers of mass mainstream gaming, and a key form of entertainment growing up for the likes of me (I was born in 1984). Wreck-It Ralph, Disney's latest colourful crowd- pleaser, portrays both the demise of blocky finger-bashers, as well as celebrating their retro appeal. It's hook is that its main character, Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly), is a bad guy. He spends his days destroying an apartment block with his over-sized hands, while the hero of the game, Fix-It Felix, Jr. (Jack McBrayer), uses his magic hammer to fix Ralph's destruction, and therefore winning the game.Fix-It Felix, Jr. is an old-school arcade game in a similar vein to Donkey Kong, a simple premise, existing solely for it's retro charm amongst modern shoot 'em-ups and dance-mat games. Treated badly by the game's inhabitants due to being the thug of the game, Ralph decides to leave to win a golden coin, cementing himself as a hero. He sneaks into a Halo-like alien shooter called Hero's Duty in which a tough female commander Calhoun (Jane Lynch) narrates to the player, but gets himself into trouble by accidentally taking an alien into another game during his escape with a golden coin. He lands in Candy Land, a colourful racing game with a similar sickeningly sweet feel to Mario Party, where glitch outcast Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman) steals his coin and uses it to buy an entry into the main race. Seeing potential disaster for his game, the ruling King Candy (Alan Tudyk), tries to put an end to Vanellope's entry, but Ralph wants his coin back, and the only way to do that is to help her win.Like the majority of Pixar's, sorry, Disney's output (John Lasseter acts as executive producer), Wreck-It Ralph has the ability to appeal to adults, as well as giving the squirts enough colourful imagery to keep their minds busy between whatever they get up to these days. Although it derives much of its humour from a reliance on the audiences' knowledge of retro computer games, the film has enough playful adult humour to appeal to a wider audience, and is most importantly sweet enough to engage the audiences emotions. Yet for people like me, who grew up on the likes of Super Mario World, Street Fighter II and Duck Hunt, Wreck- It Ralph proves to be an oddly touching lament of a time when games generally had a very basic premise, but were executed with such a charm and addictive quality, that they were entirely endearing.An early scene that borders on genius sees Ralph in an AA-style meeting for computer game bad guys, with Bowser, Zangief and Clyde from Pac-Man offering support for our titular hero. Upon revealing himself as longing to play the hero, the group erupts, with Clyde going into panic mode the same way he did in Pac-Man. It's a celebration of computer game ticks, with the apartment-folk from Ralph's game moving in a sudden, glitchy fashion, and Felix making a boing sound when he jumps. In fact, it's this ingenuity that leads to the tragic story of Vanellope, who is a glitch in the system, who's potential participation in Candy Land could lead to the player's giving up on the game, causing it to go out-of- order and entering arcade obscurity. Facing this catastrophe, the games inhabitants can at least escape with their lives before the power switch is flipped, but Vanellope cannot exist outside the game, and will die with it.It's this gentle sentimentality that makes Wreck-It Ralph so enjoyable. Pursuing Ralph is Calhoun and Felix, two contrasting game characters from two entirely different generations (Felix is smitten with her hi- def look), and start a bizarre love story that is as ridiculous as it is oddly touching. Thankfully, it is these types of moments and characters that you take away from the film, and not the overly familiar themes and narrative. Although the setting is unfamiliar and exciting, the plot shares a lot with the likes of Monsters, Inc. (2001) and Toy Story 3 (2010), and climaxes with a staple car-chase, something that seems to plague kiddie-film these days. But Wreck-It Ralph is undeniably irresistible and really quite clever, and although I would have liked to see more game-hopping ingenuity, there is enough here to sustain until the inevitable sequel comes along.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A very memorable and awesome movie!,"Unfortunately, I can't say much without giving away spoilers. So, I'll just talk about my opinion on the movie in less detail.Without a doubt, hands down, my favorite movie of all time!(so far) Even though this movie is about video games, I think even people who have a lack of interest in games will probably at least get some enjoyment out of this wonderful movie. If not, then you're loss. Anyway, the story is this character from a video game, where his role of the game is to be the bad guy, but he thinks there's more to life then just that. He's tired of being treated like a bad guy, so he decides to leave his game and go out and be good guy. That's the story in a nutshell.I love this movie for it's story, characters, setting, animation and humor. All of it is great and memorable. There's plenty of easter eggs and references for video game nostalgia adults to enjoy, while the kids will most likely enjoy watching the characters and lovely colorful animation.I would love to go into detail about why I think this movie is great, but it would involve spoilers and I don't want that.

Wreck-It Ralph: . . . Meh.,"Wreck-It Ralph was released in 2012 and is a happy little story about video game characters. Everyone I knew who had seen it said that they absolutely loved this movie, and were thoroughly entertained. Hearing so much great stuff about it I was of course very excited to see it, yet on watching it yesterday I found that it did not meet my expectations.John C. Reilly voiced the lead of this film, playing the title character. He did a fine job, but as far as animated films go the actors do not have too much of a task. It is true that voice work can be difficult, but it rarely elevates or brings down the movie when it is done well or poorly. Jane Lynch, Jack McBrayer, Alan Tudyk, and Sarah Silverman voiced the other leads of the film, the only notable one being Silverman who did the cute but often irritating voice of Vanellope Von Schweetz.Rich Moore directed and co-wrote this film along with Phil Johnston, Jim Reardon, and Jennifer Lee. The storyline of Wreck-it Ralph was excellent and the dialogue was hilarious and entertaining, yet it wasn't great. Perhaps it was the directing were Wreck-It Ralph seemed to fail for me, but I am unable to pinpoint where exactly the directing went wrong, if it did. There was also a perfectly fine score provided by Henry Jackman, which fit the whole movie, and made a great backup. I think the greatest fault of this film is that it didn't feel like the director, writers, and composer loved the movie they were making, and didn't put their all into it, and simply made a pretty good movie. The result was an entertaining film that will probably be forgotten rather quickly.I didn't like Wreck-It Ralph, but I didn't hate it either. I'm not sure why this was the case, it seemed like the perfect formula for a good movie, a great idea with good writing and animation, but it didn't seem to hit me as a movie I particularly enjoyed. Wreck-It Ralph was nominated for Best Animated Film in 2013, but lost out to Disney/Pixar's Brave.I give Wreck-It Ralph a forgettable 6.9/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"A ""modern"" Disney classic","That's what director Rich Moore said he wanted to create when he was assigned to direct Wreck it Ralph: ""a film that is like the classic Disney movies, but takes a hit off of something more modern and contemporary."" Watching this film, I can see without a doubt that he did just that!The story takes place in an arcade (don't think I've ever seen one of those in a Disney film before) where the characters of each game have their own individual lives after the arcade closes. Enter Ralph: a hulk- sized hobo who as the villain of his game, has to smash apartments every day so that his hero counterpart, Felix can repair them and is shunned and by the game's denizens as a result.Wanting something better in life, Ralph proceeds to find another video game (the characters can travel to other consoles via the cords and power strips connecting them) where he can win a medal, just like always Felix does, so he can be hailed as a hero for once. He eventually finds one, but through a series of misadventures, ends up in a candy-themed racing game where he meets Vanellope: an impish street urchin who, as it turns out, needs the medal as much as Ralph does because, due to her tendency to glitch now and again, is an outcast herself.So, as you can tell, this film has all the elements you'd expect a classic Disney film to have; yet takes place in a modern day world.The worlds that they created for this movie blew me away; you could tell that the animators pulled out all the stops with this one! In Ralph's game a classic, retro, 8-bit one everything, including the characters' bodies are square and the backgrounds are almost non-existent. In Vanellope's game, called Sugar Rush, little candy-themed touches that really stand out, such as the grandstands being candy boxes and Vanellope's bed being a sponge cake are everywhere.The characters are pretty good too, if a little stock. We've seen the story of ""misfit meets another misfit"" in lots of other films (Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, anyone?) However, Ralph and Vanellope are just so innocent and so willing to go the distance for their dreams, you can't help but like them. Felix is very likable too, as he will always do what is required of him without complaint. Heck, he goes as far as to let himself get punched in the face because it will eventually lead to him finding Ralph; you've got to admire someone like that!If I did have a complaint with this movie, it would be that the way the characters and/or objects thrive in their video game environments raises a few questions. The movie establishes that if a game is unplugged the characters within it die, yet what if there is a power outage at the arcade, do they not regenerate if the power comes back?However, that aside, I think that Wreck it Ralph will be enjoyed for many a generation to come, just like the rest of the classic Disney movies because it's right up there with them!",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Now You're Playing With Power,"2012 is a year where Pixar and Disney seemed to switch scripts. Pixar made the princess movie, and Disney made the movie about the emotions of inanimate objects. Along with Pixar's typical M. O., this Disney movie also holds a lot Pixar's trademark quality. This movie marked the beginning of a new bright age of animation for the studio. This was the first time they had Alan Tudyk provide his voice talent, a tradition they would hold for 10 more animated films. On that topic, the voice acting throughout the film is very good. John C. Riley, Jack McBrayer, Sarah Silverman and Jane Lynch are all perfectly casted, matching the voice with the character.All the technical stuff of animation, voice acting, and music is well done. But what puts this film above the rest are the characters and story. This is a clever story with unique world building. They do a good job of introducing the rules of this world without it feeling like exposition. It has good twists, pacing, subplots and ratcheting up of tension. Ralph is a good relatable protagonist. As a viewer, you relate to his blight and sympathize with him.I echo the words of Lucas, ""I love Wreck it Ralph...he's so bad.""",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
surprisingly disappointing,All i can say is i had high hopes for this movie but when i got there they slowly went away although the idea was good it lacked any good humour not once did i hear the cinema (which was full) laugh at best I heard the occasional chuckle from some one but that was few and far between and was never from more than 1 or 2 people it was surprisingly quiet even my 4 nearly 5 yr old who loves to go cinema for the 1st time ever was asking to go home because she was bored 45 minutes before the film finished so disappointing for her to and if the kids cant enjoy an animation then what is the point of them but it is easy on the eye visually but that is about the only compliment i can give.,4.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Far better than it should be,"A movie full of video game cameos and easter eggs, a relatively thin story about a Bad Guy trying to prove he's not that Bad, and video game characters entering games that aren't their own. It all sounds kinda ridiculous, doesn't it? It almost sounds like something a failed screenwriter might throw together and sell for a few bucks to make ends meet.It's not that, though. It's actually REALLY damn good. A lot of that is on the actors, but a good amount of it is on the writers as well. They took the ingredients for what could be a piece of garbage and balanced it all incredibly well, with none of it feeling ham-fisted or shoe-horned in.The lead actors' performances are fantastic, and they help make the climax, as predictable as it is, feel genuine and earned and wonderfully emotional.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Ralph Rules!!,"Wreck it Ralph is on another level! It is so refreshing to see a film that is based on videogames to be actually not just good but amazing for once and really capture the feel of retro games. The script is full of heart and humour but also has a bit of drama and pathos but of course being a Disney movie everything is alright in the end. Wreck it Ralph uses ideas and concepts of other animated films, if you put Toy Story, Monsters Inc and Who Framed Roger Rabbit in a blender you would get Ralph's unique video game hopping story. The film is full of references to retro games but it won't put of casual viewers or even non-gamers (like my mum) from the story which focuses on Ralphs search for a medal and the colourful characters and captivating worlds he visits on the way however it is worth seeing the film a second time around to try to spot famous video game characters in the background. There is also a funny mention about modern games ""since when did video games become so violent and scary"" a legitimate question. Overall Wreck it Ralph is also the best Disney film (although the unique story and characters feel a lot like a Pixar film) and has a brilliant message for kids which is a about acceptance and changing your outlook on life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Has a lot of fun with a relatively unexplored section of pop-culture.,"'Wreck-It-Ralph (2012)' takes a relatively unexplored section of pop-culture and not only treats it with respect but also intrinsically envelopes it into the story so that it is both essential, but not overbearing, and entertaining (in an admittedly 'I know that character', kind of way). The narrative itself explores occasionally powerful themes of overcoming societal conformity, prejudice and generally just being better than you or anyone else ever thought possible. It's a vibrant, unique and exciting animation that's enjoyable throughout and hits all of its emotional beats surprisingly well. Each major character has a relatively complete and satisfying arc which ultimately adds to the impact of this fun, if somewhat forgettable, flick. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Best Animated Feature of 2012?,"A video game villain (John C. Reilly) wants to be a hero and sets out to fulfill his dream, but his quest brings havoc to the whole arcade where he lives.I am going to go out on a limb here and say this was the best animated feature of 2012. While I enjoyed ""Frankenweenie"" and ""ParaNorman"" and think ""Pirates"" is deserving of recognition, this film just won my heart. I have not seen ""Brave"" yet, but have my doubts that it can compete on this level.The story is automatically a winner, as it has a bad guy -- who is bad through no fault of his own -- trying to be good. That is a great concept, and could raise interesting moral questions (which I will not do here). But they went the extra mile here and actually included real video games characters -- how they were able to get the rights is beyond me, but they did. And they threw in video game humor which was not necessary for the film to be a success, but will make various fans smile and nod (the ""World of Warcraft"" reference is over my head, but I liked the ""Zero Wing"" and ""Portal"" jokes).What makes the animation here special, perhaps more special than other cartoons, is that they had to incorporate so many styles and create mini worlds. From the 8-bit world of Ralph, to the first-person shooter to the elaborate Candy Rush... this must have taken some time and more than a small share of creativity. If a game has not already been developed based on this film, it seems only natural -- the groundwork has already been done.Does Vanellope von Schweetz count as a Disney princess? Probably not -- but I think she should.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Probably the Best Animated Film of 2012!,"Wreck-It Ralph is Disney Animation at it's best and it even has the feeling of a Pixar movie. Loaded with amazing visuals, a strong voice cast, some sly humor, and some nostalgic video-game references, this film is a must-see for all ages. As a huge fan of arcades growing up, I was able to understand most of these references and it brought out the inner child in me. The film is bright and colorful and it seems to give off happiness, especially in Candy Land.Rich Moore's film is about a villain named Wreck-It Ralph who yearns to be the good guy after thirty years of being the bad guy. But he travels from game to game trying to become a hero, but because of some unfortunate circumstances, Ralph must save the arcade from a dire threat.This film has a solid voice-cast full of some good comedians. Who wouldn't recognize the voice of John C. Reilly? He certainly brings Ralph to life. Sarah Silverman is really good and I was surprised to find out she voiced the little girl. Finally, Alan Tudyk impressed me as King Candy main because he sounded exactly like Ed Wynn, who voiced Mad Hatter in Alice in Wonderland.Overall, Wreck-It Ralph is a triumphant return to form for Disney. This film is even better than recent Pixar pictures and that is saying something. It's a charming, light-hearted film that's fun for the entire family. Video-game fans will truly appreciate this film and all the subtle video-game references. I sure did. A great film with some inspiring messages. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Wreck It Ralph,"I recently saw Wreck It Ralph and was extremely pleased. It is an animated children's film that follows the character Ralph (John C. Reilly), who is the ""bad guy"" in retro game Fix It Felix Jr. As the 30 year anniversary of his game approaches, Ralph feels unappreciated, and decides that he does not want to be the ""bad guy"" anymore. Ralph abandons his game to go earn a medal and heads over to a modern game called Hero's Duty. In an attempt to win the medal, he ends up in a super sweet racing game called Sugar Rush, where his medal is stolen by an adorable little outcast named Vanellope Von Shweetz (Sarah Silverman). I think when Rich Moore (director) started working on this film he wanted to incorporate the typical Disney theme of a hero and a damsel, but also wanted to make something fresh. From the marketing point of view, this movie is extremely crafty. Moore does a fantastic job of mixing the retro and modern cultures, doing so opens the film to a larger and more diverse audience. I think the adults wanted to see Wreck It Ralph just as much as the kids did! As an aspiring animator, I go and see almost every animated children's film, and Wreck It Ralph is the by far the best I have seen in a long time. I also love this film because it strays from the typical ""prince marries the princess"" bit that Disney has been using since the dawn of time. I would recommend this film to anyone because the bond that is formed between Ralph and Vanellope is one you won't want to miss.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Not a wreck at all,"Great movie with a great voice performance by John C. Reilly. Also a different kind of role (even if animated) for the otherwise very naughty Silverman. But apart from those voices, the animated movie you get here is a treat. The idea itself is more than funny and there is even a morality here. The good thing is, that you don't get the message hammered into you violently.It's more subtle than that. The animation is good apart from the sections that depict the ""game"" within the movie of course. But that is something that has to be that way. Kids watching this will never know what bad graphic was, because they never had to experience that. Good/bad for them is what you could say. But even they won't hold it against this movie, especially because those sections are not that long.Great comedy and good family entertainment movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Surprisingly good story and not just a gimmick movie,"A rather big racket was raised when we first heard that Disney had acquired the rights to all these classic video game characters and was in the process of making a movie about them. What was the story going to be right, were our beloved characters going to be treated fairly, who was going to be in it? Well, as it turns out, we barely get to see any of them. Most of the good parts were in the trailers. And, in my opinion, that's good.This is an original story, utilizing mostly original characters and fictional video games, but with a background of classic games and characters. And that feels right. The story is set in an arcade, where after the lights turn off for the night, the various characters from all of the games gather and spend time together. One of these characters is Wreck-It-Ralph, from the made-up game Fix-It- Felix, Jr. - a pretty blatant Donkey Kong rip-off, but in a loving manner. Villains are treated with quite a large amount of disdain by the other characters, and Ralph feels like he doesn't get the respect he deserves. He is in many ways the second most important character in the game, but the others treat him like dirt. So he leaves, trying to find recognition elsewhere.And from thereon out it's exactly what you've come to expect from Disney. Great characters, great visuals, good morals and lessons, exciting adventures and even a decent twist near the end. Ralph meets a young racer girl character named Vanellope in his travels and these two are very funny together. Ralph's way more gruff and jaded, but also somewhat wiser because his game has been around for so much longer, whereas Vanellope is much more willing to push the boundaries and able to roll with the punches, never letting anywhere stop her.Is it a perfect film? No. Personally I'm somewhat disappointed that we only get to see three games, when we had to whole arcade to explore. From the story point of view it makes sense because it always takes time to establish a new setting, but it still feels like they didn't explore all the possibilities. The secondary characters, mainly Felix and his love interest, are also somewhat boring in my opinion, though they have their moments as well.Nevertheless, it's still overall great entertainment and an excellent addition to the Disney canon.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

One of the most adorable & enjoyable animated flicks to come along in a long time.,"One of the most enjoyable & adorable animated flicks i've seen. First off, this could have easily been a Pixar film. It had that feel to it, storytelling, characters & short before the movie ""Paperman"", which was one of the best animated shorts i've seen. I loved the hell out of that short. Terrfic vocal performances from the actors. John C. Reilly is excellent as Ralph. Jane Lynch is great as Sgt. Calhoun. Alan Tudyk is awesome as King Candy. Jack McBrayer is one of biggest highlights here, giving an enjoyable & hilarious vocal performance as Fix-It Felix.The best actor of the lot belongs to Sarah Silverman who gives one of her best if not the best performance of her movie career. I'm a fan of Silverman's (weirdly), I weirdly like hearing every single crazy thing that pops out of her mind that also comes out of her mouth. She has that ""Kewpie doll"" personality and puts it all on the line with the character Vanellope. Just a very adorable, very cute & lovable character voiced brilliantly by Silverman. I've always wanted the Oscars to have a animated vocal performance category, had they done that, I would immediately just give the Oscar to Sarah, period.Wreck-It Ralph is hands down, adorable, funny, action-packed, entertaining & well-made. I'm a video gamer (of course, PS1, PS2, PS3, Super Nintendo, Nintendo 64, Gamecube & Gameboy), I used to play arcade but not anymore. Brings out nostalgia & all gamers will easily get pleased (like me) with this. This is a just a good, old-fashion hopefully Oscar-winning animated movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Global entertainment for all ages,"I never expected to enjoy this movie so much. I came to the cinema just to accompany my ten year old daughter, but the story and the characters are amusing across time and space. Across time. The first video game I've seen in my life was ""tennis"" played using a TV set and graphically was two vertical bars that the players could move only up and down and a squared ""ball"" bouncing on TV screen's sides. There is a reference to this gamesaur in the movie. And many other references to well known and less known video games. There are also references to many other movies like Tron, Toy Stories, Cars and even Alien. Across space. I don't only mean that many video games have been produced in Eastern Asia, but also that video games have had an international diffusion and some of them are now icons, like Pacman or Mario Bros.The plot is quite conventional: the strength of this movie is in details, many many details which made me wishing to watch it once again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Gamer Warning: Mind could be Blown,"A delightful film of cgi bliss! Wreck-it Ralph has some of the most dazzling displays of bright colors as well as dark, sinister gloom that creates a wonderful spectrum of eye-candy for the whole family. I do mean the whole family, too. Not only does it have many clear nods to current games on the market, but it also has some of the retro cameos that many adults will be able to relate to. The characters are very three-dimensional (in several ways) and the setting is clever, even creative in their design. You find yourself choosing your favorite characters on the spot, and even caring for them even before you get to know them better.Though the creators did miss a golden opportunity, while the story line is enticing, they could have had Ralph visit many other video game worlds, even if they weren't real games, it would have been more fun to see his reaction to some other types of games. Still, it was clear that those sorts of things may have interfered with the broad spectrum of the film itself. This movie has several potentials for gigantic sequels, and I'm even curious enough to actually play the video game itself, even though I haven't confirmed that they made one, I think it's obvious.

However, I so much appreciate the fact that the writers and producers of this film really worked hard not just on the production, but on the pre-production as well.Most animated films are just fantasy in nature, but Wreck-It Ralph viewed a different prospective for animated films. It showed a fictional idea of what may be inside the arcade game (even if we know it's just a software. Well, that makes it suited for children), what is happening around, and what is happening between the characters. I was left speechless because the idea is really really great.I also appreciate the fact that the animation in the movie were adapted from how the real characters in the arcade move. It gave a feeling of realism and was drawn closer to the hearts of gamers.It was just that it took time before the audience realized what was happening because the introduction was not that clear. I watched with my friends and all of them were baffled at first of the idea. They could have included some voice-over narrations that introduces the storyline.

Finest Video Game Movie of the Year,"Wreck-It Ralph is the latest Disney movie, but after watching it, the last thing you'll think about afterwards is ""Disney"". It takes place in an arcade, featuring many classic arcade games such as Pac-Man, Street Fighter II, Space Invaders, Frogger, Sonic the Fighters, TRON, Mortal Kombat and many, many more. But I digress.The movie centers around a video game villain called Wreck-It Ralph. He's celebrating his game's 30th anniversary, and during the celebration, he starts to realize just how unappreciated he really is. He is overshadowed by the hero of his game, Fix-It Felix. So he goes on a quest to earn some respect and show that he can be good.This movie was my most anticipated movie of 2012. I love animated movies, and I love video games. Video games are an important part of my everyday-life. And I know a lot about retro games and arcade games, so this movie was really awesome for me.I'm gonna try not to go all gamer-gasm here, because this is after all a place for movies. But let's just get this out of the way: The video game references are amazing. They're just so hilarious and they're more obvious than in something like Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. This is by far one of the best animated movies of all time, and as weird as it may sound, the video game cameos and references are a huge part of that. It would've been cool to see the game references a bit more spread-out, because the movie goes all out in the beginning with reference after reference and cameo after cameo, but then becomes more of its own movie. I wish the references would spread more out and cover more than just the opening sequence. But it still makes for an overwhelmingly awesome first part.The story is a bit on the weaker side. But the character development makes up for the movie's simple story. A lot of it centers around one side-character that at first comes off as a bit annoying, but after a while becomes more likable. The main character is also really fun to watch, and the villain, who starts off as terribly dumb and annoying, actually ends up being quite evil.The movie centers around three different made-up arcade games: ""Fix-It Felix Jr."", ""Hero's Duty"" and ""Sugar Rush"". All three of these games contain very different art styles, and the movie would have for example characters from Hero's Duty and Fix-It Felix Jr. visit Sugar Rush, a game where none of them fit in. And this especially showed in the last part.I like how symbolic the made-up arcade games are. I didn't notice it while watching the movie, but it seems that Fix-It Felix Jr. represents the ""retro gamers"", Hero's Duty represents the ""hardcore gamers"", and Sugar Rush represents the ""casual gamers"". I really thought that was a nice touch.The animation is outstanding. Not only are the video game characters animated perfectly and they really fit the movie and setting, and it's just all fun to watch them on-screen. The 3D is nothing special, but it never gave me eye-strains, nor did it distract from the movie, so kudos to Disney for not ruining the movie with 3D.Overall, Wreck-It Ralph is an awesome movie. Too bad it came out so late here in Norway, 'cause if it came out before January, I would've definitely put it on the number 1 spot on my top 10 movies of 2012 list on YouTube. Not only are the cameos and references amazing, but the movie itself is really entertaining and great. Some pacing issues during the middle, but mostly just greatness all around.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

I loved it,"Since John Lassister has takes control of Disney's Animation Division the studio has been has had a string of hits with Tangled, Frozen and their one of their best films in recent years (as well as animated film) Wreck-It Ralph.Wreck-It Ralph (John C.

He is disliked and disrespected by all the characters in the game, ignored by them during their 30th Anniversary and lives in a dumb. He seeks more from his life and wants to be a hero, so jumps out his game to seek a medal. But his actions could result to dire consequence for his game and Game Central Station as whole.Wreck-It Ralph is a delightful animated film for children and the children inside all of us.

As you except the animation is excellent, whether it's in the world of Fix- It Felix, the brightly coloured Sugar Rush and the dark alien world which parodies of Halo and Aliens.Disney find a great voice cast for the film. Reilly is a great actor who was had great comic timing with excellent lines he is given and Sarah Silverman plays to her strengths as the hyper-active, annoying Vanellope von Schweetz. Alan Tudyk was strong as the villain, King Candy, a cross between the Mad Hatter, Humpy Dumpy and Willy Wonka and was similar to Lots-O-Huggin' Bear in Toy Story 3. The animators even thrown in a fun reference to the Wizard of Oz.The script by Phil Johnston and Jennifer Lee (who went on to make Frozen) is top notch. It follows typical formula that a character thinks he needs a medal to prove he is a hero when it's his actions that count, that both Ralph and Vanellope are both outsiders in their games and that they want to prove themselves, longing for more. But it does the formula well and it tires all its story lines effectively. The characters are well rounded, there is plenty of and pacing was perfect, showing Disney is on top form.Gamers will also get plenty references and Easter Eggs and many classics game gamers make an appearance in some form.

I feel misled and deeply betrayed by the trailer, in which I was mistakenly led to believe that my favourite characters of ALL TIME, such as Bowser and Dr. Robotnik, would be present throughout.The fact that so many people are happy with this film serves as a sign of the state of society today.

One of the best Disney movies ever,"Disney has made some really good animated movies, but they had never done a lot of movies that are as bright and original as Wreck-it Ralph, the new animated film from Disney. The movie centers on Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly), the villain in the ""Fix-it Felix"" arcade game, who decides to become a hero. Because he doesn't like being a bad guy, he goes into some of the video games in order to learn what it's like to become a good guy. He also befriends a character known as Vanellope von Schweetz (voiced by Sarah Silverman) from a candy-coated racing game called ""Sugar Rush"". When Ralph accidentally unleashes a threat in the arcade, he tries his best to save the day and become a true hero.I had extremely high expectations for this movie. I had the feeling that this will turn out to be an excellent animated film. I thought the premise to this sounded really cool and clever – a love letter to video games. I really love the voice cast.So, did Wreck-it Ralph met my expectations? Absolutely! This was such a fun animated movie for all ages, and better than Disney/PIXAR's Brave (which was also very good).John C. Reilly delivered a strong performance as the title character, who wants to make a change in his life, achieve it, and become what he wants to be. That's what a great movie character is about. Sarah Silverman provides most of the movie's funny moments as one of the ""Sugar Rush"" characters who Ralph befriends, and is a ""glitch"" (a character who faults the game). She tries to get Ralph for help to become a racer once again. Jack McBrayer (from the hit-show, 30 Rock) has an amusing supporting role as Fix-it Felix, the main hero in the ""Fix-it Felix"" arcade game, who sets out to find Ralph and get him back to where he belongs. Jane Lynch does a great job playing the main character in a first-person shooter game known as ""Hero's Duty"", who tries to find Ralph, alongside Felix.I didn't see the movie in 3D; which I must say it does look pretty darn good in 3D, but I decided to stick with the 2D because of the sharp, pristine screen.The animation is simply wonderful; the bright colors, the set-ups, the environments, the characters all look fantastic. At times, the movie is very gorgeous to look at on the big screen.The characters in this were likable and funny. It was awesome to see some video game characters making cameos (like Bowser, Pac-Man, Sonic, etc.). The story to the movie is well-thought out and genuinely clever. It's always nice to see something new to the table. I really liked the themes to the movie: What does it mean to be a true hero? How can the main character's goal become a success? And so forth.Generally, movies from Disney and/or PIXAR give a lot heart into their stories, which makes the tone of the movie become very sweet. Wreck-it Ralph has enough heart to make it that way. From start to finish, this movie is a lot of fun, and when families bring their kids to see this movie, they're going to fall in love with it 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Unlike anything Disney had done before,"Unlike its atrocious successor, Wreck-It Ralph is an awesome movie. Everything that happens on-screen makes sense and nothing ever feels forced. Ralph and Vanellope have a really sweet and heartwarming father-daughter relationship. Every character feels fleshed out and well-developed and the plot is original without many flaws. It's a great movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Got robbed of the academy award for animated feature by Brave(That was cowardly by the academy),"Visually inventive and a splendor to look at,introduces us to the gaming world and there are lots of references for gamers.Has a new premise unlike Usual animated movies though in the end it might end warm hearted like all Pixar flicks/animated flicks(the good ones) by American studios.It finds a new way to reach there and makes us enjoy the gaming world.Great characters,funny and suitable voice acting,one is immersed in this i would not say childish but rather youthful world.Amazing that japan did not do a feature like this first since it is home to gaming.It is great and it is fresh,the creative well had juice in it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Fun for the whole family! Very enjoyable :),"You may find ""Wreck-It Ralph"" somewhat along the lines of ""Toy Story"", as the story is about arcade game characters coming to life, and ""Toy Story"" is about toys coming to life. But nevertheless, I found this movie very enjoyable and fun to watch. Despite the views of many others on IMDb, I thought this movie's idea was original because, come on, I've never seen a movie about arcade game characters, have you?If you lived during the arcade game peak-point (the 80's and 90's), you will definitely enjoy ""Wreck-It Ralph"", as it brings back classic games, such as Pac-Man and Mario (although Mario is never seen in th movie, which was kind of disappointing). I also think they should have included more real-life arcade games, however others would argue that it would make the movie less original.Wreck-It Ralph, a huge and muscular villain of the game Fix-It Felix Jr. is a very funny character, and the script-writers have done a great job making the movie about him, rather than a hero.Overall: Great! Go see it with your friends! Go see it with your family! Go see it by yourself! It's worth it :)",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Exactly what to expect from a Disney movie - PERFECTION!,"This movie was perfect. In fact even though I went to the cinema with high expectations it was even better than I could have imagined!I loved the concept of the movie. It has a very intriguing storyline one of which I hadn't come across before so I couldn't wait to see how this turned out. It didn't fail to impress me. I was gripped all the way through.The details put in to the animation was by far the best so far that I have seen in a Pixar movie, Don't get me wrong - all of Pixar's animations are amazing but this one somehow managed to be better than perfect. I am so impressed no words can really describe my euphoric state after watching this.The soundtrack was perfect. It really worked well with the images and story.I love the use of famous game characters too. That was a nice touch.I am in complete disbelief that this went from an 8.0 to less on this website! - that needs to change because this movie is flawless! There is nothing at all wrong with this! My mother normally gets bored with Disney and yet she adored Wreck-it-Ralph! Believe me she is hard to please!This was completely worth waiting to see and I can't wait to own this on DVD. It is PERFECT! So imaginative!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
All the Substance of an Arcade,"I wasn't really looking for much going into this movie. I figured there would be a story, some plot development, and something to neaten things up in the end. I don't think I was disappointed.Wreck-it Ralph starts as a first person account of a bad guy in a video game, quickly jumps from that to a self-help group, moves into some other video games where non-pressing problems are resolved, and wraps it all up in a ending that may or may not be happy. It was just as flat as it sounds. No CGI eye candy. No human interest development. No real attempt. I get the sense that the video game theme was meant to carry the picture, but it didn't.This film compares well with sequels that were never supposed to be shown in the theatre. If you spent time in an arcade or played any video games the characters do what you would expect. Beyond tugging at memories of past gaming experiences Wreck-it Ralph is just a disconnected collage of those same memories. Watch it and then go play some video games to erase it from your memory.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Amazing.,"This movie is good and that's not bad, it will never be bad and that is good. This is in my top three all-time great Disney movies. It blends just about everything I love together, the video game component, the heartfelt story, the underdog aspect. I mean this movie is absolutely amazing. John C. Reilly plays Ralph so well, and his story is written so tragically that you can't help but feel sorry for him.I implore you to watch this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Emotional journey of an amazing delicious movie.,"Disney has always surprised me with many amazing movies. This is not a fairy tale movie. Well, that's not a problem. I do love fairy tale movies just like the other Disneys'. But this one is different. First thought when I look at the posters, I have no idea what does this story about. But when I watched it for the first time, I'm just sitting in front of my screen and my tears falls on my cheeks. Because the movie is so emotional!!! And delicious, of course. Makes my mouth wet over and over again. High quality animations, real sweets animations, that's authentic.

One of the best of the Pixar flicks,"As story lines go, this is probably the best of the Pixar movies, up there with the Toy Story series.

It's not a one-trick pony, and it has a new, fresh, and original message.I actually didn't expect to like it, but this movie takes you into a whole new world where that world makes sense within its own context. It's not like Dinosaurs where dinosaurs struggle with human problems; this movie has video game characters dealing with video game issues, and that's the way it should be.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Deserves greater praise than it currently is given,"Not being a big video game guy, I was late to the party to the original WRECK-IT RALPH in 2012 and when I saw it, I thought ""it's fine"" and didn't really think more about it. Now that it's sequel is coming out, I thought it would be good time to revisit this film (and to also remind me of the characters of the first one). And I'm glad I did, for I enjoyed myself much more this go around with this film than I did in my initial experience.Taking a page out of PIXAR, this WALT DISNEY ANIMATION STUDIOS picture tells the ""inside story"" of what happens to Video Game characters when the lights go off. Following a ""villain"" in a game, WRECK-IT RALPH tells the story of Ralph's attempt to become a hero by winning a medal in another video game, only to become something more when he encounters a ""glitch"" in another game.This is a well made, smart animation film that has enough action, suspense and silliness to appeal to children, but enough ""adult content"" (read: smart humor that goes over the heads of the kids) to appeal to the adults that have taken the kids to the movies. It pays great homage to video games - many of which went over my head, but (I am assured) were well played (at least according to the video gamers that I am acquainted).Like all animated movies, a good percentage of the joy of this film is in the voice work - and this picture has very good ones from Sarah Silverman's Vanellope to Jack McBrayer's Fix-It Felix and Jane Lynch's kick-butt Calhoun, the voices strongly portray the character - and character types - quickly and easily. Special mention should be made of Allan Tudyk's King Candy (an homage to the the great Vaudeville and early film comedian Ed Wynn) and, especially, John C. Reilly in the title role. He is perfectly cast as Ralph, showing the weight of the size of the character in his voice with a sweetness and vulnerability that shows the size of the character's heart.This is a wonderful and winning film, one that deserves greater praise than it is currently given, and I, for one, am looking forward to the sequel coming out.Letter Grade: A-8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

A decent Disney animated film,"Since the early 2010's Disney Animation seems to have a bit of a revival, and this film is a big part of the reason for that.Yes, it helps if you're a gamer and can identify with some of the cameo's, but even that aside this is a fun and entertaining enough film.While it's never going to be my favourite Disney film, it's well worth a watch once.",3.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Animation At Its Best!,"This is an animated film about game animation. It references everything from ""The Matrix"" to ""Pong"" to Japanese anime. It is one of the most imaginative films I have ever seen. Couple that with the fact that it features some great voice talents and amazing art work, and it is great viewing for anyone who appreciates gaming or animation.You know you are seeing great animation when the story covers all the emotional bases, including tearjerker scenes. How much talent does it take to get the viewer to invest in the relationships between cartoon characters so much that they are moved to tears? This is a great story that rivals any Pixar production, especially since it incorporates the stylings of each (real life) game it mimics.My favorite aspect of the game is Sarah Silverman's portrayal of Vanellope. I have read some other viewers' comments about not liking her voice, but she is delightful, especially since the animators used her expressions for the character as well. They did the same with Jane Lynch's character, Calhoun.There is nothing I can criticize about this game, which I enjoyed throughout. The credits are even worth watching. This film is a 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
It has a bit of everything,I saw this movie in 2D at the cinema the other week. I was not expecting too much but I was pleasantly surprised and really enjoyed the film. It has a bit of everything: pathos; excitement; thrills; action; tension; love; plot twists; surprise ending; nostalgia; good characterisation etc. It's a good story that keeps you involved and interested all the way through. The film gets you involved and soon has you rooting for the characters. It helps if you are young enough to have played the games shown in the film or have children (or grand children) who have - but this is not essential for your enjoyment. Definitely worth seeing whether you are young or old.,8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Finally! An Unpredictable Disney Movie!,"This movie, from all the movies I've watched this year really made its mark. Its the first Disney Movie since Toy Story in which I was just completely blown away and was left completely in suspense. The advertising does show exactly how Wretch-It Ralph feels about his place in the world. I think it actually is a very relatable theme that many people can relate to. Essentially his game and the pressure from the system is forcing Ralph to be the big bad and unlovable person that he was created to be. Ralph shows them off by his heroic actions in the film. Besides from the theme the rest of the movie is completely unpredictable, and even more so, because of the games and plots that conjoin throughout the movie. Without giving spoilers, Wretch-It Ralph finally finds two things that he was looking for. One is what he was originally looking for, and the second which is what he found on his journey while looking for the first. The question for him is which of them really give him the value he is looking for.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Nearly Perfect,"I loved every second of Wreck-It Ralph.The jokes were spot on, the gaming references were plentiful but not overbearing.The script was tight, and the overall direction, voice acting, and animation were seamless.The only reason this didn't get perfect was because at times there were some cheesy moments and lines that were painfully obvious.But then I realized, even though I went to see a 10:30 pm screening with my buddy, this was meant to be a first and foremost children's flick. And with the exception of odd lines like that I completely forgot that I wasn't the target audience, and THAT is pretty amazing.I wasn't overly shocked to see that John Lasseter was a producer in this flick!9/10 for gamers and non gamers, children and adults!",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Wreck-It Ralph — Video games have a life of their own, you know","Wreck-It Ralph was a movie that I was anticipating because I loved the idea behind it. That's usually a bad sign. Too much anticipation can ruin an experience. To my great joy, it wasn't the case. The movie delivered what the preview promised, except for one thing, you spend a greater part of the movie in a single video game world.The animation is excellent, the story interesting, the basic idea pretty novel, and the characters lovable. They were even able to insert a pretty dramatic and heart wrenching scene as well as a hero finish. You can't ask for much else.It's an all around excellent animation film, and if you're even slightly interested in video games, especially those old 8-bits ones as well as how it all evolved and the different types of games, you'll be in heaven.Go see it on the big screen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Best Animated Film of 2012,"¨My name's Ralph and I'm a Bad Guy. I'm 9 feet tall. I weigh 643 pounds. Got a little bit of a temper on me.¨Wreck-It Ralph is my favorite animated film from 2012. It reminded me a lot of Toy Story, only this time the characters that come to life aren't toys, but video game heroes and villains. The characters are really well developed and everyone who enjoys playing video games will love this movie. Adults will also enjoy it as the film gives us a sense of nostalgia and love for some of the older games. The graphics of the movie are all really cool; especially the scenes that take place in the ¨Sugar Rush¨ game. The Sugar Rush game has some similarities with Mario Kart and the Wreck-it Ralph game with the original Donkey Kong game. It's really hard not to fall in love with these characters, especially with Ralph and Vanellope who shared a wonderful connection together. I think that it was a plus that the actors' recorded their characters' voices together in the studio because you could really feel the connection between them, unlike in most other animated films. This led to some extremely funny dialogues which were probably mostly improvised. The flow of the movie was much better this way and I really enjoyed it. I hope it wins the Oscar for best animated film because it was much better than the competition. I also loved the short film, Paperman, that was released with this film. A wonderful short story that helped set the nostalgic mood for Wreck-It Ralph.Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly) is the villain of his arcade game Wreck-it Ralph. His mission in the game is to wreck an apartment complex which Fix-it Felix Jr. (Jack McBrayer from 30 Rock) tries to fix, therefore making Felix the hero and beloved character. When the arcade game shuts down at night, these characters come to life inside their games and they can travel to other games inside the arcade through the machine's electrical plug. There is a ¨Game Central Station¨ where the characters can travel from one game to another and therefore Ralph decides to go to a meeting with other villains from other known video games to express his feelings. He is tired of being the bad guy and wants everyone to like him so he doesn't have to be on his own. In order to become a hero, he decides to enter another game and try to win a medal so he can prove to the rest of the characters that he can be a hero. He suffers an accident inside one of the video games and ends up in Sugar Rush where he meets Vanellope (Sarah Silverman) who happens to be a glitch inside her game. They discover they share a lot of things in common like being an outcast so they become friends and decide to help each other out on their mission to be accepted.I thought the plot was pretty ingenious and I loved the world that was created by director Rich Moore and his team. Moore is mostly known for directing some Futurama and The Simpsons TV episodes. He made some really memorable characters and I think the improvising between the actors added more funny moments and heart to the film. I really loved this story and the world they created through these video games - some invented and others authentic like Pac Man, Sonic the Hedgehog, Zangief from Street Fighter, Bowser from Mario Bros, Q'Bert, Paperboy, and Tapper who all have some cameo appearances that fans will enjoy. I also have to give a lot of credit to Sarah Silverman who did an excellent job with her character. I loved the way she delivered each line and made her character so lovable. I think her performance was the highlight of the movie. The chemistry with John C. Reilly was incredible as they shared a lot of lines together. I also thought McBrayer was really good voicing Felix, and Jane Lynch the same with Calhoun, the general from another video game called Hero's Duty. Overall I have to say I really loved this movie and found it entertaining. I absolutely recommend it.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

If you loved Toy Story & Finding Nemo...,"This movie does for arcade games what Toy Story did for toys. DON'T shy away from it just because it's technically ""video game"" related. You do not have to know video games to enjoy it just the same way you didn't have to be an Oceanographer to enjoy Finding Nemo.Sure, gamers will get a laugh or two more than a non-gamers but even still, the video game references are light and it sticks to the very basics lightly referencing only the most popular games like pacman, mario, and sonic. You don't need to know any of these games to get the story at all. All of the MOST important characters are NEW, from games that don't even exist in real life, and thus, are established well in the plot of the movie rather than it being understood that YOU ""knew"" who these characters are.This is a perfect family movie for little kids, and BIG kids who grew up with games as old as pacman. It's funny, exciting, and touching; pretty deep for a kids movie. The only kids movie I've seen that's deeper than this one is Toy Story 3. If Toy Story 3's depth is a 10, this movie is about a 7 or 8.I went to see this with my 4 year old nephew and at 27 years of age, I felt the magic of my childhood coming back to me in this charming movie which drew on many of my memories.

Brilliant film for the whole family,"I first heard of wreck-it-ralph a couple of months ago and i was pretty hyped with the concept of a video game related movie by Disney. i had very high expectations as i went to watch but i was also kind of expecting the typical stuff you would expect from a Disney animated movie. After watching this i can say that this movie far exceeded my high expectation an is easily in my top 5 movies of this year.First of all i think is relevant to know about me to know what type of person is reviewing this. i am 20 years old student that enjoys video games and was drawn to this game by the cameos of iconic games like Sonic of Street Fighter. i enjoy most type of movies and although it hard to admit i like cheesy stuff when its done right. i say this because this movie will be cheesy and corny at some points but i think it does it in a way that most of the people won't mind unless you are a heartless ""i'm too cool to watch kids show"" guy.Let's start with the story. for an animated movie, BRILLIANT. don't expect the depth of a thriller or mystery movie but expect something kind of childish with a lot of depth. Everything fits really well together there a lot of little details that makes the story really shine. there some parts you would expect but also really amazing plot twists that make sense and make you say ""how did i now see that!"" just because it fits so well. the environment is most of the time VERY childish i mean expect a lot of pink and cute stuff all around. but honestly it just gives the movie more opportunities to make good innocent humor. however, there are parts that are less childish that i'm sure will appeal to larger audience.Now with characters. probably one of the best aspects of the game. the characters show very human behavior even being video game characters. you can actually relate to all of them and know why the do what they do all of this while retaining their uniqueness. for an animated movie the background of each character is pretty depth and they even went on describing some of the secondary character's background so i think that was nice. also Vanellope is by far the biggest heart-Stealer i have seen in a long time you will just grow to love this character sooooooooooo cute and i say this in a very manly way.on other stuff i think animation was amazing. 3D is definitely worth it with this one and overall just really good. the sound was good, kind of too pop but it kind of goes with it and they didn't have any other choice. The humor is very innocent yet clever and overall i really enjoyed this series.In conclusion i think this a great family film i recommend it to anyone who has no issues of watching a VERY well made kinds movie but if you are not into innocent humor, inspirational message and cute stuff then you may want to skip it but i'm guessing you are OK with those since you are reading the review of the film anyways.well, thanks for reading!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Adorable; a great movie all around,"Wreck-It Ralph was one of the best animated movies I've seen in a long time, and that's saying something. There are gems out there like Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc., and A Bug's Life, and this may have just topped them all. It was different than all other Disney movies, which was so nice to see. Whoever thought of the idea for having a ""real world"" inside of arcade games deserves a pat on the back. 'Game Central Station' I mean, come on! That's genius! The graphics, the plot of the different games, the characters, it's what made it so good! The whole movie was so intriguing, like an actual video game. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the humor between Venellope and Ralph. It was very immature, but then again it is a kid's movie.John C. Reilly was so perfect for this role, and Jane Lynch as Calhoun was great, too. I wish they disguised her voice, though because I couldn't stop thinking of Sue Sylvester. And then we have Sarah Silverman as Venellope– I've gotta say that her voice matched her character, but her voice annoyed me so much. And lastly, I had to give a shout-out to my boy Skylar Astin as Roy. Good job Skylar!Lastly, let me end with the adorable mini film ""Paperman"" in the beginning. Did it bring tears to your eyes, too? The premises of it was a young man and woman who met at a train station come together again by fate or paper airplanes. Definitely a great way to start off!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A true/awesome Video game-Movie!,"Video game movies, if I remember correct, have always sucked! Owe it all to directors like Uwe Boll, who made every other video game adaptation suck. What could have been mediocre if not great video game adaptations were thrashed well beyond recognition. Of course we do have 'loosely- based-on/cheesy-but-enjoyable' Resident Evil franchise and 'Live action movies' based on major game titles produced by the game studios itself ala 'Halo Forward Unto Dawn'. But a good video game-movie was still in destituteness.ie until now!If you are the ones who like to skip previews before the feature film I'd say go early and it'll pay you off quite immensely for there is a gem of a Pixar short to be seen. Entitled 'Paperman', words just fails me to describe how lovely its animated. I wont spoil anything here you just have to watch it for yourself!The story is paper thin, Ralph plays an antagonist in a game called 'Fix it Felix'. While the protagonist of the game, 'Felix' makes friends with everyone; Good-at-heart-Ralph gets tired playing the bad guy for 30 straight years and he decides to prove that he is not so mean. To please his fellow NPCs he sets on a journey to earn a medal in a game and bring back his glory. The plot sounded good enough to show off a plethora of vivid game worlds that Ralph ends up in, but sadly it ain't so and we are given mere 3 game worlds; Ralph's own 'Fix it Felix' game, the Halo- esque 'Hero's Duty' game and the very kiddish 'Sugar Rush where most of the story takes place. Of course we do get to see the 'Game Central' where most of the game characters as well as NPCs use it as a transit. It was a who's who of characters when it came to Game Central, Sega's characters aplenty along with some old. It all spirals down to a cameo- heaven of a movie filled with truck load of game characters inducing nostalgia in almost every frame. Gamers will know exactly what I am talking about. And there comes the second problem the non-gaming community could well be put off with some of the iconic characters in the movie as they are not aware of em. For instance while I was laughing my ass off at the Metal Gear Solid 'exclamation' in a scene, but my friend was sitting beside me numb seemingly incognizant about the Metal Gear Solid lore. I am sure kids will love it but amidst these Call Of Duty generation who would know about arcade classics like 'Qbert'?'Ralph' is voiced by John C Reilly and I think nobody could have done it better. He literally voiced life into Ralph. I just could digest Sarah Silverman pulling off a kids voice. Maybe its me, I've seen her literally churn out abuses and couldn't visualize her voicing the 'shes- so-cute, I-am-gonna-die-Vanellope'. On the other hand Jane Lynch's PG13 trash spewing bad-ass 'Calhoun' was a pure delight to watch and maybe its coz she's portrayed as one hot female gamer. Alan Tudyk's 'King Candy' too was a worthy mention.The animation is spot on, from the jerky movements of the characters in Fix It Felix to the super fluid 'HD' animations of Hero's Duty it all complements the appropriate game worlds. Myself being an FPS fanatic, I loved 'Hero's duty' game and would like to get my hands on it. Fix It Felix will make you relive your old arcade adventures. The score by Henry Jackman was pure awesome. He's turning out to be quite a Hans Zimmer. He'd composed the score for X-Men First Class and it had been one of my favorites from last year. Equally satisfying is the soundtrack featuring excellent tracks by Owl City, Skrillex and Rihanna. My favorite was the 'Celebration' track by Kool & Gang. Be sure to check out the soundtrack, its worth it.Wreck-it Ralph is an incredibly fresh and heartfelt take on videogames. Its not a video game adaptation per se but its a movie made for video game lovers by video game lovers. As I said before, non-gamers and even casual gamers may find themselves disrupted but not too be distracted from the plot.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
It's What An Animated Film Is Supposed To Be,"Did you ever see a movie that was so brilliant, so creative and ingenious, that you couldn't seem to find the words to fully describe it? Well, ladies and gentlemen, that's how I feel about 2012's ""Wreck-It-Ralph"", an animated film where the whole family can be entertained. Meet Wreck-It-Ralph, a video game villain who's been doing the same act of destroying things in the same video game, in the same video arcade for the last thirty years. Being lonely and wanting to be a good guy for a change, Ralph decides to go on a quest to another game and the results, while chaotic for everyone in the video world, are a total blast for us.On his journey, Ralph encounters a variety of hilarious situations and characters, such as the feisty Vanellope, who like Ralph, also desires to be something different in her candy-coated video world. But they must hurry, for they are being chased by the goofy yet real villain, King Candy as well as an ""Aliens"" inspired infestation of bugs that Ralph inadvertently brings with from another game. Luckily, help comes in the form of a tough as nails warrior, Sergant Calhoun, and from Ralph's game, Fix-It-Felix. There are many things that make this movie worth watching: the fact that the filmmakers are able to really capture the look and feel of the video game world with such fine detail and vivid colors, the inclusion of real video game characters as well as ones who were inspired by real ones, awesome music, but above all, in addition to having plenty of comedy, the movie has heart. Even though the characters may be animated video game characters to begin with, there are still moments where emotion hits you hard, such as the scene where Ralph is tricked into helping King Candy destroy Vanellope's car because he thinks he is doing it for her own good. It gets me every time and that's when you know a film has good writing. But a lot of the credit for the film's success needs to go for the actors who do the voices, such as John C. Reilly as Ralph, Sarah Silverman as Vanellope, Jack McBrayer as Fix-It-Felix, Jane Lynch as Calhoun, and Alan Tudyk as King Candy, plus, a whole lot more. To sum it all up, ""Wreck-It-Ralph"" isn't just for kids; it can be for anyone who used to love going to the arcade, for parents who want to take their kids to a movie that's fun but has an important message, or just for anyone who might need a good laugh. Either way, don't miss this one. 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Have you got time to Wrecktify all the things that you should...,"First, I should say that I prefer animated short films (namely the old Looney Tunes cartoons) to the animated features. Second, I wouldn't call myself a fan of Disney movies. Nonetheless, ""Wreck-It Ralph"" isn't a bad movie. Like ""Toy Story"", it depicts man-made objects - in this case video arcade games - coming to life when humans aren't around. While the good guys from the games get sycophantically celebrated, the bad guys feel cast out and just want to get accepted. Perfectly understandable that they'd want this. As with ""Monsters, Inc"", the world of these non-human individuals is made to look like another version of the human world: the plug socket is a video game version of Grand Central Station. Basically, the tykes can enjoy all the silly stuff while the adults can laugh at the references to the real world.And of course I can't avoid mentioning the cast. We all know who John C. Reilly, Sarah Silverman, Jane Lynch and Ed O'Neill are. I had seen Jack McBrayer in a number of movies and TV shows but hadn't learnt his name until now. Alan Tudyk also voiced the Duke of Weselton in ""Frozen"" and more recently appeared in ""Trumbo"". I loosely know about Mindy Kaling's work. Dennis Haysbert is known for ""24"" but also played the love interest of a 1950s suburban wife in ""Far from Heaven"". Edie McClurg often appeared in John Hughes's movies and notably received a profanity-laden rant from Steve Martin's character in ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"". The rest of the cast includes Laraine Newman (one of the original ""Saturday Night Live"" cast members) and Maurice LaMarche (Egon on ""The Real Ghostbusters"").In conclusion, I'd say that you'll probably like the movie.PS: Litwak is an anglicization of the Ukrainian name Litvak.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
My smile muscles hurt by the end,"Although I'd seen many positive reviews of this movie, I went in without great expectations as I've never been much of a video game player, and hence didn't expect to get many of the references, but what I got was a brilliantly funny story that still managed to whack me between the eyes with the darker moments. My smile muscles hurt by the end, and I can't say that of a lot of movies. Kudos to all the main voice cast (I did not recognise Alan Tudyk at all), and to the animators, if only for the way they managed to capture in Sgt Calhoun not only Jane Lynch's likeness but also her trademark tough sexiness.Also, the short feature (Pixar is apparently infecting Disney, which can only be good) is an entirely wordless sweet little story, and of course you should stay for the end-credit Easter Eggs, and the insanely boppy songs.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"An exciting animation, witb mind-blowing visuals.","This film is possibly the BEST viseo game vased film I have seen. It excceded my expectations and was really suprises that it was made by Disney, as it feels more like a Pixar or Dreamworks film. This film truly works well as a 3D animation. I love the visuals in this. The story is also very good as well. I absolutely love Ralph and Penelope and all the other side characters. The villian is ok, but I do like his back story more. It is an amazing Disney flick that I 100% recommned. Disney Animation were on fire during this time.

outstanding,"This was a terrific movie. It was about time they did a movie about video game characters-and computer animated was the way to do it! Wreck It Ralph is the villain in a video game, and his dream in life is to be a hero. (or at least a good guy) They say that the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence, and he admire the way everyone looks up to the ""good guy"" in his game. He crashes a party for the good guy but winds up making a mess of things. Ralph then comes up with a plan:he will become a hero by sneaking into another game and winning a medal in that game. Of course, his plan goes awry, and he winds up learning that you don't need to win a medal to be hero in someone's eyes.I absolutely loved this movie. It features cameos from some of my all-time favorite video game characters like Pac-Man, QBert, Sonic, and their respective villains. I also like the mention of some other classic games like Frogger, Centipede and Asteroids. I also loved the ""group therapy"" scenes with the villains, the character of Wreck It Ralph, his game, other characters, the ""new games"", and the action scenes. This was very delightful John C. Reilly was the perfect choice in the lead. I grew up in the ""video game craze"" of the early 80s and knew all about the games, so I was able to catch some of the stuff. Let me know if you need any explanations, especially of some of the games I talked about. QBert was a great game.

"Colourful, as sweet as candy","This is my favorite animated movie of 2012, and of course Disney's man it ought to be good in quality. The story line was good, not a complicated one that make you to think twice to understand rather watching the visual treat. its enjoyable and love to watch again in big screen.Next I would rate very well the music, its the best part of the movie. Music by Henry Jackman quite fits the movie very well. Cinematography is quite brilliant, nice creativity by the art director Ian Gooding.Director Rich Moore could have taken the way the movie goes in better. Sometimes it lacks the entertainment part because what I thought was not there which I felt could be better rather what happened in movie..

A Nutshell Review: Wreck-It Ralph,"Think of this film as the electronic gamer geek's equivalent of Pixar's Toy Story, where the characters in the games come alive in their respective consoles when all the humans in the arcade had gone for the day, Traversing one another's world through electronic means such as cables, switches and control stations, those of us who had grown up in the 80s and 90s will find this a nostalgic wet dream come true, with countless of easter egg style appearances of famous games we had once played growing up, peppered with characters whom we had once upon a time commandeered through countless of adventures against the on board computer's AI, defeating scores of enemies that usually don't possess too much intelligence, bring programmed to be repetitive, or at best increasing its speed and response in order to force us into conceding the token used to activate the game.Ah, those were the days, which were vividly relived in how Wreck-It Ralph took time and effort in capturing those 8-bit gaming heydays. The story centers around the titular Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly), the default villain in the Fix It Felix Jr. game, where he wrecks a condominium because its developers had unceremoniously booted him out of his favoured slack spot, only for the hero Felix (Jack McBrayer) to come along, repair the damage with his magic hammer, and boot Ralph from the rooftop. You can imagine if these characters are real, just how dead end the job is, especially when accolades go to the hero, while you the villain remain forgotten, or largely ignored, just because well, you're the bad guy. Ralph has done this for 30 years, and in his rare appearance in the Villains' Annonymous meeting chaired in Pac-World, he confides his desire to be admired and appreciated instead, only to be earnestly advised by the likes of Street Fighter's Zangief (director Rich Moore himself) and Zombie (Raymond S. Persi), that what matters is what's inside, not labels.And truly that's the simple message that goes out to the audience of various ages, the older ones here to witness Toy Story in an electronic environment, while the younger ones undoubtedly charmed by the colours and designs that resemble one big arcade game that comes with different default built-in games for the variety on display, be it the violent first person shooters in outer space, a saccharine sweet car racing game with all female competitors, or the good old 8-bit styled games where the characters' motion isn't that smooth, to reflect the lack of refinement and limited technology in games that we grew up with. The story is surprisingly very much layered, with multiple easy to follow sub-plots that deals with Ralph's search for acceptance, his acquaintance with Vanellope (Sarah Silverman), an outcast like himself for her being the glitch in her world, and his friendship with Felix, and not forgetting the threatening adversaries that come in the form of a fast-breeding bug, a crazed King Candy (Alan Tudyk) that was more than meets the eye, and from the real world, the danger of having one's game labelled Out-of-Order.The filmmakers here, with first time feature director Rich Moore at the helm, had built a world complete with the necessary rules befitting of something that exists online. If one's game is Out of Order, then the characters will be forced to abandon it and live as nomads of sorts in electronic limbo, or go out permanently with the game. And mortality is reminded again through Sonic the Hedgehog's announcement that if they were to perish in someone else's game world, they will perish permanently. It may be sombre-sounding, but with Moore having cut his teeth from Futurama and early Simpsons episodes, these are naturally masked with a sense of wit and humour, with a story geared toward an encouraging theme of learning to accept and being oneself, and not doing things to seek the approval of others. And the partnership between Ralph and Vanellope is set to endear, despite them being loggerheads when they first start out. I suppose it helps when one of them is a hulking giant with impossibly huge hands, and the other being the wide-eyed child who defies her world's establishment bent on disallowing her to partake in a race. You can see why they click, being outcasts of their own world, put together in an Us versus Them situation.The characterization here is primarily what makes this film stand out, and many can identify with Ralph during times of insecurity, or having that yearn to belong and feel accepted. And perhaps this film inspires us a little that despite how we look on the outside, it doesn't really matter so long as we stay true. You'd come to admire the effort to clear rights and put in iconic characters from the days of old computer games, and it's certainly a hoot to imagine them up to something else outside of what they were built or programmed for, with the filmmakers throwing a challenge to everyone in trying to identify the multitude of characters and games they had put in to pay homage to. This alone begs multiple viewings just to roam the corners of the vast landscape painted, to spot something that others may not have already, and call it in.Wreck-It Ralph has everything, from themes of friendship, romance, action, comedy, mystery, and an incredibly moving ending that makes it a surefire winner. I'm going to stick my neck out and put my vote behind this as the best animated film this year to have come out of the Hollywood machinery, with plenty of heart and soul even if the characters are supposed to be made up on bits and bytes. With a little bit of luck since the environment has been set, perhaps we may even see a sequel or two (hopefully not direct to video) for further adventures of this big friendly giant.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Wreck-It Ralph (2012) - You're a Bad Guy...But That Does Not Mean You're a Bad Guy!,"""Wreck-It Ralph"" is the newest addition in a series of classic films brought to life from the one and only Disney Animation Studios. It's the film that will steal the hearts of millions and millions of video game fan-boys, but also some film lovers, as well. ""Wreck-It Ralph"" tells a newly original story about a video game character named Wreck-It Ralph, voiced by John C. Reilly, who's the bad guy in an arcade game named ""Fix-It-Felix Jr."", a game that has been around for 50 years. Ralph is the bad guy that wrecks the building, while Fix-It-Felix, voiced by Jack McBrayer, is there to fix the building with his trusty hammer. But, when the lights go off at the arcade, the video game characters come to life, when nobody is looking. Yeah, it's very similar to the premise of ""Toy Story"", but this is a different movie with it's own way of telling the story. Anyways, while Fix-It-Felix is the character of the game given the most recognition, it's Ralph that is given tons of loathe, since his reputation is just being the bad guy who just wrecks the building. But Ralph doesn't want to be the bad guy anymore, and he wants a chance to actually become the good guy for once, and actually get the recognition he has always wanted. So, Ralph decides to go ""turbo"", jumping from one game to the next, trying to win a medal for a game that will turn him into a good guy. I should stop discussing about the plot at this exact moment, because it's completely better to walk into this film with a clear state of mind, and I bet you, you'll walk out incredibly surprised. ""Wreck-It Ralph"" is one of the best and one of the most entertaining films of the whole year. It's that rare family film that never loses it's heat. Reminding me a lot of another great film, ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"", this movie does a great job of delivering a lot of great pop-culture video game references, while not going too far by throwing them at your face. If you're a die-hard video game lover, there's going to be a lot of familiar video game characters that they'll easily be able to spot throughout the entire 92-minute run time. I also loved how this movie ""pokes fun"" at the video game world, where video game characters can travel from one game to the next, and how some characters can come to life after the arcade closes. It's one of those rare concepts that will definitely keep audiences entertained for the majority of it all. Now, that we got all of that ""fanboy"" talk out of the way, let's focus on the rest of the movie! The animation is made perfectly, and it's so great to look at, it actually felt like a Pixar-film at times. John C. Reilly and Jack McBrayer both deliver some of the most memorable voice performances of the year, especially John C. Reilly, who delivers such a realistic performance that feels more like a human being, than just a video game character. But there are plenty of members in the voice cast that have their ability to shine. From Sarah Silverman's role as a little girl that Ralph meets in a game called ""Sugar Rush"" (a cross-over between Mario Kart and Candy Land), Jane Lynch as the bad-ass leader of a group of soldiers in a game called ""Hero's Duty"" (think of ""Call of Duty""), to Alan Tudyk as King Kandy from the Sugar Rush game, who seems to be a duplication of the Mad Hatter from ""Alice in Wonderland"" (the original one, not the one with Johnny Depp). As the film continues to entertain all audiences alike, it's until the third act when the movie starts to do something unexpectedly. It reaches to an emotional level, leading to a heartwarming final act. From the first shot to the closing credits, this is a feel-good and entertaining motion picture that knows it's audience, and keeps the entertainment factor cranked all the way up to 11, even with the usual and traditional storyline of believing in yourself, and always stay true to who you are, even if others view you differently. From a cool soundtrack, clever use of video game references, beautiful animation, incredible voice acting, and a great heart, ""Wreck-It Ralph"" is the best animated film of the entire year.

A Visual Treat!,"Wreck-It Ralph is amazingly funny, entertaining and appealing to almost everyone - be a 90s kid or a YOLO teenager.The animation is terrific and by far the most colorful animated movie of 2012 I have seen.

Entertaining,"When I first read the summary, I thought it'd be an interesting watch; especially because as an 80's child, I highly enjoy any reference to the good old arcade games. I was a little bit disappointed that there weren't more of them, however; but not as much that I couldn't enjoy the brilliance of the movie.The best thing for me would have to be the characters from the ""Fix it Felix Jr"" game moving just like the old 8-bit characters moved in the real games: those unnatural jerky movements. I found that little detail endlessly entertaining. The graphics were very good, especially when we were shown ""Hero's Duty"" and ""Sugar Rush"". Vanellope was adorably done and I just know that if I'd been a kid still, I would have fallen utterly in love with (the sweets in) her (hair).I did find some parts of the movie a bit long and I was disappointed that over half of the movie was built around Sugar Rush.But apart from that: solid story, solid graphics, lovable characters and references to a few 80's Arcade Games.

Another great Disney film. I loved it.,"WRECK-IT RALPHIt was really good.Disney seems to be on form at the moment. Wreck-It Ralph was a lot of fun, and seeing as I am an 80's boy... it was great to see some of the super retro characters on the screen.When I was a kid I loved playing Mario, Sonic, Street Fighter etc... and a lot of the characters from those games and more appear in this movie.Ralph is the bad guy from the arcade game Fix it Felix. But when the arcade closes at night and all the games close down... the characters come to life. Ralph is sick and tired of being a bad guy and wants to be a good guy. He feels like all the other characters from his game hate him and he just wants to be accepted. Ralph seems to think that if he gets a medal, he will become popular, so he crashes another game to get a medal... and the adventure begins.The story is genius. I thought it was very imaginative. The characters were great and likable.It is also very colourful. I watched this film with my girlfriend, my 12 year old daughter and my 7 month old daughter. My little girl was even glued to the movie for over an hour... until she fell asleep... but I doubt it was the film that sent her to sleep... it was just past her bedtime. :) hahaWIR is not as good as some of the classic Disney films, but it is a great film.I will give this film 8 out of 10.A very good movie, and I hope Disney can keep up the good work.For more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Wonderfully creative!,"Disney's latest animated adventure is a wild ride that nerds and boring people alike will find irresistibly fun! But ""Wreck-It Ralph"" is ultimately for the gamers, who will likely have more fun chuckling at all of the clever in-jokes and cameo appearances by famous video game characters. Beneath it all is a plot-structure older than Atari, but it's the shiny box the story comes in that makes it so desirable. John C. Reilly voices Ralph, a video game villain who longs to be loved and appreciated, desiring more for himself than his angry job description dictates He game jumps (Gasp! What will his home game do without him?) in search of a way to become a hero, and in doing so meets new friends and risks his life (if you die outside your home game, you die for good) to give them a better one. Sarah Silverman, Jane Lynch, and Jack McBrayer also offer their voices to this high-energy sugar rush that gives life to impossible characters and situations in an exhilarating way that no one has done since Pixar dunked us deep into the waters of Australia.-Thomas Bond",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

"""I'm bad, and that's good. I will never be good, and that's not bad.""","Gotta love video games. Whether looking at the retro arcade games in their 8-bit glory, or the modern high-definition open-world sandboxes, games have always had a fantastic ability to transport the player into a whole new world, and give them full power and control to explore it, change it, and maybe even wreck it.In light of this, Wreck-It Ralph is a fun animated adventure somewhat reminiscent of such films as Bolt or Finding Nemo, albeit set in the world of arcade games. Chances are good that you'll geek out at seeing such familiar characters as Qbert, Sonic the Hedgehog, Pacman, and various other classic characters. And, hey, is that a Metal Gear reference I see? Could this one scene be a spoof off of Halo? There's a wealth of geeky references and comedic nuances involved with the arcade world, and the film works with it the best it can.Regardless, the film isn't all third-party software. It does set up its own environments, each one highly detailed and imaginative, and the film sets up its own rules that sets things up for a very thrilling storyline. In addition to some splendid eye candy, the film does have plenty of action and peril, and it does have some amusing comedy. Even if you're not an avid gamer, audiences of all ages can relate to the lighthearted spirit of the film.The story is quite decent and clever. The plot builds itself really well on the characters, who prove to be the most endearing aspect of the film. The film digs up some strong and heartwarming themes of self discovery and being yourself. In fact, Wreck-It Ralph shares much in common with the stories for Megamind and Despicable Me, since all three films showcase bad guys who are proud to be evil, but wind up being lovable. Such themes, and a few emotionally strong scenes, help make the film stand out above most other CGI-animated films.As a CGI-animated film, it looks great, with smooth animation and highly-detailed renderings. Voice-acting is decent, and the writing is pretty fun. This film has a plethora of fun and excellent designs for the characters, locations, props, and costumes. Music is quite fun too.Recommended.4.5/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

A refreshingly fun flick,"Wreck-It Ralph is one of the best Disney Animated movies I've ever seen since the Toy Story series. I grew up watching Disney Animated movies such as ""Aladdin"" and ""Hercules"" and today I still love watching the most recent ones such as Tangled (Which came out a year before this one). The studio still continues to make the most heart-warming and entertaining 2D and 3D graphic movies out there. The movie itself is filled with fun characters and there's not a single boring part in the movie. The idea of fusing together different kinds of worlds in one film certainly creates a unique kind of mood, especially for the kids (""aliens"" for the boys and ""candy racing"" for the girls). I have also been into video games in general for a long time, especially 8-bit and today's. The movie also has a lot of great charm, good slangs, great main characters, and a clever storyline especially for gamers and techies (like myself). Overall, a great animated video game-themed movie with a nice amount of heart by Disney.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
It takes you on a journey where you just have to hop on and see where the road takes you.,"***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***As soon as I saw the trailer for this movie, I was stoked. I mean, what could be better than a movie about video games? I had high expectations towards this movie and I can say that it delivered on all fronts. At the beginning, it was good already because you got to see some video game classic characters such as Bowser, Ryu, etc. As the movie progressed on, not only did the movie go into a whole new dimension but it picked up quite nicely.The graphics, effects, and overall picture were pretty amazing! The whole storyline was what really caught me though. Going into this, I thought that the storyline would only appeal to children. However, many adults can enjoy this film as well. Gamers will most especially enjoy this movie but even if you aren't, it's just as good. The casting was done well in my opinion. Not sure if they made it intentional for the characters to look like the people providing voices for them but I think it was a nice touch. Jane Lynch was spectacular. I think she played the role of Calhoun really well. Along with her back story, she's probably my favorite character after Ralph.While this movie may be an animation, you would think that all the mushy stuff would only appeal to kids. However, in the scene where the virtual world was literally crumbling and getting shred to pieces with Vanellope (Sarah Silverman) unable to escape, it was quite a touching moment. Probably the best scene of the movie which tested its viewers emotions, well done on that scene.Overall, Wreck-It Ralph is a really good animation film and is probably the best since Up debuted. The characters were all very likable even the villain. A very good movie for everyone to watch. Not only is it great for everyone, but it does a good job of appealing to your emotions. All in all, this movie takes you on a journey where you just have to hop on and see where the road takes you.Rating: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Best Animated Movie Of Recent Times,"Disney has made some really good animated movies, but they had never done a lot of movies that are as bright and original as Wreck-it Ralph, the new animated film from Disney. The movie centers on Ralph , the villain in the ""Fix-it Felix"" arcade game, who decides to become a hero. Because he doesn't like being a bad guy, he goes into some of the video games in order to learn what it's like to become a good guy.I had extremely high expectations for this movie. I had the feeling that this will turn out to be an excellent animated film. I thought the premise to this sounded really cool and clever – a love letter to video games. I really love the voice cast.So, did Wreck-it Ralph met my expectations? Absolutely! This was such a fun animated movie for all ages, and better than All the recent animated movies so far.I must say it does look pretty darn good in 3D. The animation is simply wonderful; the bright colors, the set-ups, the environments, the characters all look fantastic. At times, the movie is very gorgeous to look at on the big screen.The characters in this were likable and funny. It was awesome to see some video game characters making cameos (like Bowser, Pac-Man, Sonic, etc.). The story to the movie is well-thought out and genuinely clever. It's always nice to see something new to the table. I really liked the themes to the movie: What does it mean to be a true hero? How can the main character's goal become a success? And so forth.It's a classic no doubt, and Wreck-it Ralph will be one of those movies on my ""favorites"" shelf for decades to come. The true triumph? Wreck-it Ralph feels like that classic game that has been a part of my childhood ever since I can remember; the type of classic where you throw hundreds of quarters away and you honestly just don't care, because it is just that good.

Out of all the characters in this movie my favorite is Fix-It Felix Jr. Not just because he's played by the hilarious actor Jack McBrayer but also because he reminds me a lot of myself because I too am a pretty good person who a lot of people are so happy to see all the time and I too am also someone who will do whatever it takes to make sure that any and every friend of mine is okay like how Felix tried his best to find Ralph and get him back home to their game, but I truly admire Ralph and all he went through just to prove that he too has what it takes to be a good guy even though in his game he's supposed to be the bad guy. It's true when it comes to those bad guys from all those wonderful games we all know and love and play like the bad guys Bowser from Mario and the Ghost from Pac man and Mr. Eggman a.k.a. Dr. Robotnik from Sonic and now even Wreck-It Ralph from Fix-It Felix Jr. Which is that just because they're bad guys doesn't mean they're really bad guys, it's just their job and that's all. If you haven't seen this wonderful Disney masterpiece yet than you're missing out on something super incredible and wonderfully amazing, you'll be absolutely enthralled when you witness a fantastic adventure about a video game character who sets out on a remarkable and dangerous journey to prove that he's so much more than just a bad guy, he's a wonderful and very sweet guy who's both bad and good and there truly is more to him than meets the eye just like all good people and bad people. In life it's abundantly clear about the kind of people we are or choose to be and Wreck-It Ralph will ALWAYS remind me about who I'll always be and if you see this film than I hope it'll show you too what I know whether you're good or bad, watch this movie you'll love it and don't ever forget.

Good cartoon.,"It's a fun family movie, characters, sounds, scenes, and plot lines. Personally, I think it's good. Looks fun and not boring As a child, I rewatched it many times. There are many scenes that I have been impressed with and have not forgotten. I saw this and wanted to play the game. There are many scenes that are very funny to watch. The graphics of this cartoon in those days were very beautiful. Can watch for all ages, not boring. This part is well written, the story is well written, the sequel is fun, recommend this story, it's fun and funny.

An ABSOLUTE Blinder! The finest animated film of the year!,"many people might not agree, but 2012 has been a pretty good year for animation. With Paranorman, Pirates! Band of Misfits, Frankenweenie, Hotel Transylvania and Brave (among others), there's been plenty of pleasing films for all ages. And Wreck-It Ralph is simply an awesome creation by Disney, by far one of their greatest works in quite some time, a beauty. I feel sad that I couldn't watch it on 3D. A must watch! Credit should be given to these guys Rich Moore, Phil Johnston and Jim Reardon for coming up with this awesome story and Phil Johnston-Jennifer Lee for screenplay.Overall a really great movie; Spectacular animation, the bright colors, the set-ups, the environments, the characters all look fantastic, great voice work, emotional and even touching at times, and humorous too.Academy Award for the Best Animated Feature Film, is written all over it! I wonder how on earth, Golden Globe picked Barve over Wreck-It Ralphthis film simply doesn't have any competition, its way ahead from the other nominees.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Amusing with some nostalgia value. 77.5%,"It's hard to imagine who this movie is pitched at, as most of the humour arises from nostalgia for old video games which the target audience (children) would no doubt be ignorant of. In the cinema, I can't say that I heard a lot of reaction from the children watching this movie (which isn't to say that they didn't enjoy it...maybe they did). If you haunted amusement arcades back in the day or played on old consoles, then you should have fun with this movie...you just might have to convince your children (or grandchildren!) that there's something in it for them!The movie's premise is like that of ""Toy story""...an animated cast of characters from video games come alive when the arcade closes and lead an independent life. I did get a laugh out of things like a big exclamation mark appearing over one character's head...a pop cultural reference I am sure would go over the heads of the young viewers in the audience (from the ""Metal gear solid"" series of games).There was one scene which made me enquire what rating the movie had...there's a scene where a zombie character has his heart literally ripped out by another character and paraded briefly, like a trophy. This was the only moment when I was aware of the audience reaction...it was pretty much along the lines of ""Ewww!"". The movie is rated ""PG"" in Australia, which I suppose might be reasonable. Since no small children were obviously scarred for life by this scene, maybe I am just being too concerned about the 'appropriateness' of such content in this movie?Themes in this movie are good food for the target audience (children) to chew over...overcoming other people's perceptions or expectations for you; self-belief; the value of duty; trust; ulterior motives; assigned roles etc. The titular character in this movie has to deal with some of these issues...in a video game is 'the bad guy'...the one who destroys things. He'd like to be the good guy for once so enters other games in order to achieve this.Eventually it dawned on me that one of the voice cast for this movie was ""Ken"" from the sitcom ""30 Rock"" (Jack McBrayer).The female character of ""Glitch"" was one who I found engaging and she also has to deal with some of those themes I outlined above...she's something of interest for young female viewers no doubt...although one of her jokes at the end of the movie did seem quite dark too!Since I am most familiar with the older games represented in this movie (not that I necessarily played them or was a fan of them), I can't say that I know if there are any new game characters which would be known to a young audience and hence give them a reason to take a particular interest in this movie.There is some product placement in the movie...I mean, apart from the obvious use of characters who feature in these old arcarde or video games.As an adult, this movie appealed to me, hence the good score.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Wildly Entertaining,"Wreck it Ralph is kid friendly at its core and as an added plus equally entertaining to adult. All you can ask for in child entertainment is firstly, a movie or animation that is not overly violent for know apparent reason. Secondly, there should be a clear point that the children can connect too, in perhaps the form of a life lesson, the size of the lesson or point is irreverent at this point. Thirdly, for God's sake the movie or animation should be able to keep an adults interest; albeit barley!Wreck it Ralph not only was a bona fide hit but my niece and nephew loved the very fact that is was based on video games. My niece loved the character Vanellope, voiced by none other than Sarah Silverman. Whereas my nephew thought Wreck it Ralph was, to use his words ""A good Guy-Not bad guy"" yes, he really liked Wreck it Ralph. John C. Reilly, did an outstanding voice over job as The Ralph personality, I sat through the movie trying to put the voice to a Hollywood face.However, I would be remiss if I failed to take a shot at Brave winner of the ""best animated feature"" I guess marketing wins over substance. I asked my niece and nephew, whom they preferred, hands down Wreck it Ralph won by a land slide. Furthermore, having performed this rather unscientific poll, I can only assume that a.) Wreck it Ralph came out to late b.) Brave had a massive campaign push that gave it the Oscar edge c.) The Academy dropped the ball yet again. If past evidence has any weight, I whole heartedly believe option C is the most viable option.Wreck it Ralph was entertaining and taught the little ones that there is more going on then what is on the surface. My niece and nephew, if any indication, loved this movie, and I too think this is a must watch of child and adult alike.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Surprisingly, this is a particularly great movie for fathers","This is definitely one of the very best animated movies I've ever seen in modern times, and the reviews already make that clear. What I see in this movie that others haven't brought up is that it's a great story for fathers, despite not having any actual fatherhood in the story. The personal struggles of Ralph throughout the movie and as he meets the other main character are a pretty good reflection of what it's like to become a dad. Mixed emotions, uncertainty about one's place after a long time in the same path, making all kinds of mistakes--it's basically all there. In a society where women are valued and men are disposable, this story does a great job of showing off the humanity behind the social expectations of masculinity. It's heartwarming to see the growth of a flawed outcast as he finds his place in society, learns how to change his weaknesses into strengths, learns to rely on others to help him with what he can't accomplish on his own, and becomes a positive influence on others as he finds his own happiness.I've narrowly dodged dropping spoilers so that you can see what I'm talking about for yourself if you haven't already watched this movie. Even if you're not in the target demographics (kids and thirty-something males) you can take a lot of good things away from this movie. It's absolutely worth a watch. If this review is still around in 20 years,l and you saw this as a kid, give it another watch and you'll get so much more out of it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A Top-Tier Animated Experience.,"I love CGI, I even studied it in education. I can put my hand on heart and say Wreck-It-Ralph is one of my favourite animated films.Being set in a world of video games, it doesn't constrain itself to one anchored theme. It has something for everyone from kids, to teens, to nostalgic adults.The story is credible within it's universe, and it's fun to try and spot the subtle Easter eggs and callbacks to other games that don't get the spotlight.It's one of very few films of which had a twist that genuinely caught me off-guard, and I can respect that hugely seeing as it's a bit more of a kid's film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Animated movie of the year,"I criticised Super Mario Bros. as a bad movie adaptation of the video games, so after I reviewed that I decided to write a review of a good movie about video games and I consider Wreck-It Ralph to be among the better ones.The plot follows a video game villain called Ralph who has served as the bad guy in his video game for 30 years, but he's sick of being a bad guy and decides to leave his game in order to become a hero in another. He ends up becoming a hero by getting a medal in a FPS, but when he's leaving he ends up losing it and is thrown into a racing game and in there he encounters a girl called Vanelope who has dreamed of competing in the race for ages and finally gets a chance to when she steals the medal from Ralph and uses it to enter the race. Ralph learns the only way to get his medal back is to help Vanelope win the race. However, back at Ralph's old game, due to Ralph not being in the game, when their game starts up, Ralph is not there so they are temporarily put out of order, so Ralph is also on a time limit to get back to his old game before it's shut down for good. Scenes seem well thought out and seem to know when they might seem to start to run stale and cut themselves off before it does, with the exception of a couple of scenes. Scenes are also well thought out however a couple of scenes near the beginning there were a few scenes that felt unnecessary. For example near the beginning, Ralph is going through a metro, which is actually the wires running from the back of the arcade machines which all lead to a power source and can go to whatever game they want. The scene when they do this feels unnecessary because the whole 3 minute scene builds up to a joke which I only got a chuckle out of.The cinematography in this film is very good. They have a mixture of sets that they experiment with and all of them add to the overall feels that we are in totally different environments as we jump from game to game. When we're in sugar rush, we are in a bright colourful environment with bright personalities but when we're in the fps, we're in a setting that looks a bit like the Alien movies with dark setting and more serious personalities.The films comedy is mostly good. Most of the jokes work however there were a couple of jokes that I predicted the outcome. One thing I'll admire about the joke department in Wreck-It Ralph is that it doesn't rely on running gags to fill in it's comedic element like most other comedies, instead it relies on mostly thought out humour and light hearted jokes to get itself through and I admire it for that.The music is well composed but there are a couple of questionable music choices. For example when Vanelope is driving around they chose ""shut up and drive."" That might sound like a good music choice on paper but in my opinion, I don't think it works in it's execution. Apart from that the music is good.The acting is also good, however none of the acting particularly stood out. The acting was good but I can't really think of any voice actors in particular that gave a noteworthy performance, except for Alan Tudyk as King Candy. He gives off a gr8 comedic voice for a villain that still fits in with the game he's from.Overall I still really enjoyed Wreck-It Ralph despite the film having a few shortcomings. I would recommend it to nearly everybody I know. Go out and watch this film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
They were so lovely characters,The story was exited than I hope ! I never think that bad guy in the games want to be a good guy too. I very surprised that Fixing will have a love with the women in onther game like this because they have the very different high. I can think only that they will just have only one romantic part ! At all I think this is the greatest animation I had watch !!,10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
It's not only a game any more,"It is approximately 15 years ago I played the game first time. I have to say time flies. Fix-It Felix now could not be a popular game among the children but it's still in our hearts. I say this movie is amazing because it turns a sort of old boring (comparing with today's games) game into a vivid animation. In this film the game is never inferior than those new games like Sugar Rush and Hero's Duty. And it made the roles much more lovely than they originally are, especially Ralph. A bad fierce guy in the game surprisingly got a mild personality. Game is just a game, people never got a deeply thinking about it, about what could happen if the characters gain different personalities. This film did, and made them cute.The motivation for Ralph to leave his own game is very simple ""to be a hero, to get a medal"". So there is nothing perfect than Hero's Duty. However accidence happened which also gave Ralph a chance to be a real hero. Although it is only a animation, it gets not a few things deserving adult to think about. Like being reckless with greed, the ending of competing in illegal ways, what the attitude to the honesty and responsibility and so on.The whole story is complete and consistent, the plots are reasonable and creative, the roles and the voice are awesome, the picture and animation are vivid, and the emotions come from the characters are real and overwhelming.

A sincere tribute to video games and genuinely heartwarming animation,"If you have picked up a controller at any point of your life and liked it, chances are Wreck-It Ralph will entertain your gamer within. Full of pop, retro and gaming references, it's a fun and clever commentary that will be enjoyed by old and young audience alike. Firstly, the poster and trailer show Bison, Zangief and such, but they are only brief cameos, so don't expect Sonic to headline the movie. It's essentially the quest of titular Wreck-It Ralph, a designated villain of 80' arcade game, to obtain much longed acceptance.The theme is universal, and it will resonate for gamer or non-gamer. In what seems like a video game version of Toy Story, the movie tells a secret consciousness the game characters have inside the virtual realm. After the arcade closes, they will return to their lives, the game is their job, so to speak. There are support group for the villains, bars, and homes, making these digital avatars more humane. Its main characters are different representatives of popular game heroes and villains. Fix-It Felix is similar to Mario, Wreck-It Ralph has Donkey Kong feel, and Sergeant Tamora looks similar to Fem Shepard. I imagine the cost of hiring actual famous characters would be detrimental to their budget.Story is pretty fast, giving plenty of personalities to the main characters and still manages to snuggle dozens of references. The different gestures, tidbits, and even sound effects are amusing, the alert noise from Metal Gear is gold. Each character has their own style of speech and body language that not only fitting for their stereotype, but also for the voice actors. Fix-It Felix is voiced by Jack McBrayer, the goody two-shoes from 30 Rock, I can literally picture the actual person doing the silly stuffs the on-screen character does.John C. Riley, the comedian, plays Wreck-It Ralph well and adds his own slightly crude demeanor. Jane Lynch, angry coach from Glee, is my favorite as Sergeant Tamora from the game, Hero's Duty, a comedy mix between two first person shooter giants. Video game isn't just cosmetic appeal in this movie, it has sincere role, and the fact it has many 80' and 90' references gives it a wide range of demographic. The creator shows plenty of respect and knowledge of the source, it's integrated seamlessly and without disrupting the pace of the story. Bountiful and meaningful fanservice made just right.The movie is simply entertaining and funny with spot-on family value, it's also a homage to video games done right.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Love this film,"Being one of my favourite Disney movies and having not seen the second movie yet I thought it would be a good idea to watch the first one and get reacquainted with the characters and the story in which I enjoy so much. This is a film in which I always look forward to watching and that I like the concept of as well.I love that Wreck-It Ralph shows the movie from a bad guys perspective who just wants to be accepted for who he is but because of his job people don't respect him. Having him want to get a medal to change this and gain the respect of those around him I think is really sad and shows how he does not feel like he is good enough because of those around him. This is such a strong message in my opinion about how people only see you the way that they want to and not for the person in which you are and how people have a strong impact on people. I think that by having him go into another game to get a medal however ending up in a car game where is helping a little girl achieve her dreams of racing is so sweet and I like that it showed how the girl liked him for who he was and that he didn't have to pretend to be someone who he wasn't. This showed that people will like you for yourself and sometimes you just need to meet new people and find the ones in which accept you as yourself with. Showing later in the film how the good guy in the game Ralph belongs to called Felix realising how he isn't liked elsewhere and understanding how Ralph feels is powerful as it helps to show how just because you are liked somewhere doesn't mean everyone else will like you and that sometimes going through someone else's experience can help you to understand them as well as create a new kind of bond with them. Finally, I like how the King in the racing game was pretending to be nice but underneath was mean which helped to highlight how some people can put on an act about being a nice person but can have an evil core and will do anything to turn people against one another like he does to one of the children within the game, showing how some people can be bad even when they don't act like it all of the time. Personally, the animation style of this movie is something in which I really like and really helped to make this more of an arcade type feel to the movie. Not only this but showing arcade characters within the movie which people are aware of such as Bowser, Sonic and others was a nice way of showing different games in which an older audience was able to enjoy and bring them back to their childhood. Not only this but by having a bad guy support group was something in which I thought was really cool as it showed how they all felt the same and that they wanted to be liked by others and that even though they were classed as villains they still have feelings and wanted to talk about them, which made them feel more human.Wreck-It Ralph is one of the best Disney movies around in my opinion and I can't wait to watch the second one. This is a film in which I think the whole family would enjoy and does have a great message for children in which I think is a key aspect of this movie. I would highly recommend this to Disney fans, people are fans of video games and those who are looking for a movie to watch with the whole family. I am definitely going to be seeing this again",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Wreck It Ralph,"Wreck-It Ralph is a compilation of beautiful animation, beyond fantastic voice acting, and well thought out humor. It looks great with Disney Plus' 4k transfer and John C Reilly, Sarah Silverman, and Jack McBrayer can do almost no wrong when voicing an animated character due to their distinct and unique voices. Disney has shown time and time again how they can take such a simple, kindergarten level message (don't judge a book by its cover, treat others the way you want to be treated, etc.) and not only teach it to children but re-teach it to adults. And not only re-teach it to adults but re-teach it in a deeper, almost philosophical way.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
The princess is in this castle,"When the villain of a popular arcade game decides he's had enough of being the bad guy, he sets out to win over the other denizens of his game, with hilarious consequences. Wreck-It Ralph is a wonderful little film that combines smart dialog, brilliant animation varieties, and an abundance of familiar video-game characters - even to those who don't play games on a regular basis.Ralph (voice by the underrated John C. Reilly) has one job - wreck an apartment building. When a kid puts a quarter into the machine's slot. Ralph shouts his catch phrase and then climbs the building (he's quite large), destroying windows, bricks, the whole nine yards, until the hero of the game, Fix-It Felix (voice of Jack McBrayer) arrives to save the day (with the help of the human player). The game is sort of a combination of Donkey Kong (helpful handyman) and Rampage, a game in which huge monsters scaled skyscrapers just to destroy them.Anyway, Ralph has a quandary. While the rest of game's characters live in the fancy building within the game, he lives in a literal pile of bricks and dreams of something more. And when he notices that Felix is throwing a party celebrating the game's 30th anniversary without inviting Ralph...well, Ralph doesn't much appreciate that and vows to win a medal, any medal, in order to convince the building's occupants that he's not as bad as everyone thinks.This leads Ralph to jump into other games, a tactic that's forbidden. He winds up in a first-person shooter game much like Call of Duty, sneaking in as a foot soldier, and manages to grab a medal. Long story short (ha), this sort of screws up that game for the human player, and the main character of said war game has to track Ralph down among the other games in the arcade, because she realizes something else has left the game with Ralph.Ralph winds up in a game that's a mixture of Mario Kart and Candyland. Actually sounds like fun, doesn't it? He meets Vanellope (voice of Sarah Silverman), who's a glitch, an error in the game's code that would be more trouble to remove than leave in, so in she stays. Vannelope manages to get Ralph's precious medal but promises to give it back if he'll help her build a racecar so she can win the game's race. Well, the race within the game. Still with me? Vannelope is an outcast as a glitch, so she has quite a bit to prove. Ralph, of course, will help her, even though she's a smart-aleck little brat.Is there more to all of this than meets the eye? Sure! Will it go over most kids' heads? No! Is it still enjoyable for physically grown-up people? Heck yes! Sure, this is a Disney film, so Lessons will be Learned, but there's so much eye-candy - uh, literally - that the message is not heavy handed in the least. And what is that message? Nonspoiler alert - it might be that Ralph does have what it takes to be a Good Guy after all.I loved how there were so many different characters from different game systems (Nintendo, XBox, arcade-only, Sega, you name it); the Bad Guy support group includes one of the ghosts from Pac-Man, Bowser from the Mario games, M. Bison from Street Fighter, one of the guys from Mortal Kombat, and so on. Each is drawn in his own original style. Same for the various good guys who make cameos in the movie, like Sonic the Hedgehog, and Pac-Man himself. The blending of art styles is impeccable and spectacular. I'm also a fan of quick wit, and Silverman can quick-wit with the best of them, particularly when matched against a slow-witted character like Ralph. Oh, and did I mention the Candy King? Yeah, he runs things in that candy racecar game, and he's voiced by Alan Tudyk (Firefly) with an accent right out of old Hanna-Barbera films. Priceless.Is Wreck-It Ralph a great film? Not exactly, but it's hard to find a comparable movie. Other Disney movies have their own style, as do the Disney/Pixar films. This one is a stand-alone treat, exhilarating for kids of all ages, especially those who grew up playing that old 8-bit NES. Or those of us who were stuck with the Atari 2600. Or those who spent hours and hours in actual arcades, fighting space invaders and helping a dumb frog cross a freeway. And even if you've never once picked up a game controller, you'll appreciate the humor, the voice delivery, the story, and the message.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
What A Masterpiece,"This is has been favorite film of mine ever since I was little. I relate to the characters in this wonderful movie. The best way to describe Wreck-It Ralph is a neurodivergent video game love letter. The story is smartly written. The animation is colorful and awe-inspiring. The characters are very relatable for someone like me. The comedy is goofy and unpredictably funny. The music slaps. The message about self-acceptance is handled beautifully. It does have few flaws but in my eyes I love it. This is going to sound weird but this film has saved my life. I feel happier and safer when I watch Wreck-It Ralph. Wreck-It Ralph gets a 10/10 for me

Splendid visuals and graphics with a winning story,"This is Disney's 52nd animated feature and i must say it's truly a magical film.

Definitely worth waiting,"As a teenager I had once seen the trailer of this movie when I was at the hospital. Afterwards I never got to see this trailer ever again. I didn't know the name of the movie and we didn't have an internet back then, so I could neither ask anyone nor look it up. The trailer showing Bowser and Eggman were just enough to have me sold. Then when the movie released I saw its name in the newspaper, but within the next week it was taken off (probably it didn't earn much here). So ever since then I wanted to watch it. I finally watched it in 2018 and I'm really glad I could.Wreck-It Ralph is the story of a videogame villain who wants to be a hero, but he can't do it because of how much he's used to being the bad guy. After he meets Vanellope, they both embark on an adventure to help Ralph get a medal which Vanellope had otherwise given away as a prize in her own game Sugar Rush. There are many fun characters like Fix-It Felix, Calhoun and King Candy. There is even a cameo appearance of Sonic, which is like a dream come true for a huge Sonic fan like me.The story is great for children, the visuals are phenomenal like all Disney animated movies, the voice actors are decent, the comic timing is hilarious and unexpected (the Oreo march, Felix fixing the prison bars while trying to hammer them, Ralph running around in Calhoun's game etc). I'm pretty sure if I was a kid and I had watched it, I'd have been completely blown away by it and it would have become my favourite movie. I watched it when I was 19, and yet I really enjoyed it (the rating is from that time so I have written this review from that perspective). For the veteran gamers there are a lot of hidden jokes, easter eggs and references scattered around everywhere.I really want this franchise to expand even more. Ralph has come as a playable character in Sonic and SEGA All Star Racing Transformed. I mean, this is a movie about a game character. It would really be injustice if we don't get Sugar Rush in real life, or Fix-It Felix for mobile phones. The movie was pretty good, since it established all the ideas not even the sequel could ruin.

Way better than expected!!!,"When I first looked at Wreck-it Ralph I was like ""no, not gonna see it, way too childish for me"". But somehow I ended up seeing it anyway - which I did NOT regret! Even though it's animated this movie just got some things not even all ""real"" movies (which would be the not-animated movies) got. The plot is amazing written and the story is sweet with a bit of an edge with a hint of surprise.I really fell in love with the characters. Ralph is - which is one of the many things I liked the most - hard as a stone on the outside which make him an outcast, but on the inside he's a total sweetheart and he knows it.All summed up this is an AMAZING movie. Not only for children. Watch it alone, with your friend, your girlfriend/boyfriend, your family or something completely different - the only thing that matters is that you watch it!",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Short review,"This has a super interesting story for an animated film. Never expected it. It even has a twist in the end. The emotions portrayed in the movie is also very real. And the concept is top notch, a fair execution of the idea. One of the beat in its genre..
Overall outstanding",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
honestly one of my favorite movies of all time!,"I could literally watch this masterpiece of a animated movie over and over and over and over again without getting bored in the slightest, as a fan of animated movies, and and a fan of old school video games and even video game related movies,. this movie is absolutely perfect, the characters are amazing, all the references to video games are really cool! Also this movie has a really good message, as Zangief said, I'm a bad guy, but I'm not a ""bad guy"", all about seeing the real person beneath the label, and letting other people see it too. Hands down, its a fantastic movie, and will always remain one of faves. Another thing I'll add the music in this movie is really amazing, especially the music for the Hero's Duty scene, love me some Skrillex wubs.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Great cute fun!,"Wreck it Ralph sure is a great cute family friendly film! This movie is well written, well animated, and well voiced by the different actors. Sarah Silverman, one of my favorite people ever, stars as the voice of Venelope, and she does such a great job! Her voice fits so well for the main role. And Jane Lynch is a perfect choice for the call of duty like female gamer role! I really loved how this isn't just one of those pointless kiddie movies about nothing special, but this is actually a very well thought out film worthy of many big time cinematic roles. The plot summary is intricate and very smart, this is not a one dimensional movie, this is such a great movie that anyone and everyone can and will enjoy! 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Great Imagination,Right Up There With the Toy Story Franchise,","Wreck It Ralph is a fantastic movie with a brilliant storyline,a terrific voice cast and hilarious characters that you grow very attached to.The movie is very funny,with great heart and imagination.Its not as good,but its just as good as the Toy Story movies,I could see Wreck It Ralph being just as big,with sequels,theme park rides,merchandise,this is Walt Disney Animated Studios very own Toy Story,so they shouldn't waste what they got,more should definitely be made.The movie is also beautifully animated and caprtures what living inside sn arcade game would really be like.I would recommend Wreck It Ralph to all fans of Disney animation,it has enough for all ages of the family to enjoy.Set in a video game arcade,Ralph (voiced by John C.Reilly) is sick of being the bad guy of his game,so he leaves to prove that he is not a bad guy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
CHEER! - (8 stars out of 10),"The stage curtains open ...""Wreck-It Ralph"" is one of the most original ideas I've seen for a movie in a long time - and it took the wonder of computer graphics to bring its imagining full scale to the silver screen in a way no other type of animation could have. In other words, you don't have to do any brain work here - they've already done it all for you.In the world of arcade video games, Wreck-It Ralph is one of the ""bad"" guys. He destroys - and the game's hero, Fix-It Felix Jr., repairs. It is a rather simple video game with simple graphics and programming - and after 30 years of being the bad guy, being the outcast and living alone during the down times, Ralph has had enough. He wants to win a medal and be the hero for a change. This leads to a chain of events that finds him bouncing out of his game to another one called ""Hero's Duty"", where he actually claims his coveted prize medal. However, when he accidentally ends up in another game called ""Sugar Rush"", a little glitch called Vanellope gets in the way of his dream - and the only way to reclaim it is to help her realize hers.A fun movie from top to bottom, ""Wreck-It Ralph"" does a great job of building strong characters while crossing different eras and genres of video gaming effectively. The main backdrop of the story is in Sugar Rush, with everyone who's pulled into it from other games having a pivotal part in saving that video game's universe.This one comes at a high recommend. It brings back the good ol' days of arcade video gaming which was so prevalent in the 80's (my generation) - a time gone by. Seeing the old Nintendo game controller was fun too, which heralded in the age of home video gaming on a large scale. I am anxiously looking forward to watching the sequel next.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Wreck-it ralph,"Disney has made some really good animated movies, but they had never done a lot of movies that are as bright and original as Wreck-it Ralph, the new animated film from Disney. The movie centers on Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly), the villain in the ""Fix-it Felix"" arcade game, who decides to become a hero. Because he doesn't like being a bad guy, he goes into some of the video games in order to learn what it's like to become a good guy. He also befriends a character known as Vanellope von Schweetz (voiced by Sarah Silverman) from a candy-coated racing game called ""Sugar Rush"". When Ralph accidentally unleashes a threat in the arcade, he tries his best to save the day and become a true hero.I had extremely high expectations for this movie. I had the feeling that this will turn out to be an excellent animated film. I thought the premise to this sounded really cool and clever - a love letter to video games. I really love the voice cast.So, did Wreck-it Ralph met my expectations? Absolutely! This was such a fun animated movie for all ages, and better than Disney/PIXAR's Brave (which was also very good).John C. Reilly delivered a strong performance as the title character, who wants to make a change in his life, achieve it, and become what he wants to be. That's what a great movie character is about. Sarah Silverman provides most of the movie's funny moments as one of the ""Sugar Rush"" characters who Ralph befriends, and is a ""glitch"" (a character who faults the game). She tries to get Ralph for help to become a racer once again. Jack McBrayer (from the hit-show, 30 Rock) has an amusing supporting role as Fix-it Felix, the main hero in the ""Fix-it Felix"" arcade game, who sets out to find Ralph and get him back to where he belongs. Jane Lynch does a great job playing the main character in a first-person shooter game known as ""Hero's Duty"", who tries to find Ralph, alongside Felix.I didn't see the movie in 3D; which I must say it does look pretty darn good in 3D, but I decided to stick with the 2D because of the sharp, pristine screen.The animation is simply wonderful; the bright colors, the set-ups, the environments, the characters all look fantastic. At times, the movie is very gorgeous to look at on the big screen.The characters in this were likable and funny. It was awesome to see some video game characters making cameos (like Bowser, Pac-Man, Sonic, etc.). The story to the movie is well-thought out and genuinely clever. It's always nice to see something new to the table. I really liked the themes to the movie: What does it mean to be a true hero? How can the main character's goal become a success? And so forth.Generally, movies from Disney and/or PIXAR give a lot heart into their stories, which makes the tone of the movie become very sweet. Wreck-it Ralph has enough heart to make it that way. From start to finish, this movie is a lot of fun, and when families bring their kids to see this movie, they're going to fall in love with it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"""The kids call me retro, which I think means 'old, but cool.'""","To be honest, as fun and imaginative as this film looked in the trailers, I was hesitant to see the movie, since I was concerned that the humor and subtext (if there was any) would be largely lost on me, a non-gamer. When I finally got to see it at the dollar theater, it reminded me why I love animated films so much. What these movies excel at is retelling a familiar story in an unfamiliar setting. Children's and family media has plenty of ""villain"" protagonists, from How The Grinch Stole Christmas to Megamind, and plenty of underdog stories- specifically, the journeys of misfits proving their worth to society and to themselves. Wreck-It Ralph has both these elements heavily influencing the plot, but almost never comes off as contrived or repetitive.One reason why is, as I said before, the setting. The art shift between the arcade game worlds, whose designs are all distinct, but are all believably interconnected in the network of tubes and code that links all the arcade games together in ""Game Central Station."" The jerky movements and the rounded, egg-like shape of the townspeople in ""Fix-It Felix, Junior"" is just as familiar and real (or rather, unreal) as the ""Hero's Duty"" soldiers' stiff, lumbering gait, or the bounce and skip of the anime-esque inhabitants of ""Sugar Rush Speedway."" Even if you've never played a video game, it's easy to recognize all the styles and aesthetics as authentic, if decidedly enhanced for a higher-quality medium. The viewer is allowed to explore the world of each game along with the characters, getting to experience a variety of landscapes through the journey. It was a joy to be immersed in those almost-too-bright colors and the variety of textures (something still lacking in many live- action films which use CGI) that created the confectionery landscape of ""Sugar Rush"". The arcade world is full of humorous, inventive touches, such as an explosion generated by Mentos stalactites falling into a spring of acidic Diet Coke, electrical cords acting as a literal ""tube station"" between games, and storytelling conventions' impact on characters (Sergeant Calhoun is ""programmed with the most tragic back story)"". The rules of the arcade (what few we get), and the threat of being ""unplugged"" if the game breaks down and can't be fixed, is evocative of Toy Story and other such films, and they impact the plot in a similarly dramatic way.The story was well-executed, in that it followed the pattern of quest/journey to a reward/happy ending (the plot of most classic video games as well, incidentally), but it threw in a few good twists and turns. There's a moment in the film where two characters have a misunderstanding, one thinking that they've been betrayed. This is something that's done a lot to extend a story, and mainly, it's a waste of time for everyone, since the characters just spend the whole time moping until they make up. But there are consequences to the misunderstanding in this film, and it progresses the action, rather than slows it down, with everyone coming together for the finale.Likewise, a main plot point is the shared bond between Ralph and Vanellope, who both want to change their destiny, but the worlds they live in won't let them. However, the prejudice against them, while shown as a negative thing, is given a valid reason. Being the bad guy is literally Ralph's job, and if he isn't there to do it, the game doesn't work. Vanellope's story, however, turns out to be the much more interesting one. She is an outcast for being a glitch in the game, which, in the other racers' eyes and the king's, means she isn't a real character in the game, and shouldn't be allowed to race. It seems like a typical plot with the bullies just being bullies just because, but then the king gives what sound like a logical explanation, which Ralph and the audience can accept.This revelation raises some questions, and it takes a while before the whole truth is clear. There were a few things that could arguably count as plot holes, but it's hard to quibble when it's a cartoon world whose rules are only explained in a basic sense, especially when the characters are so entertaining.Standout performances come from John C. Reilly as Ralph, Jack McBrayer as the hilariously innocent, naive Fix-It Felix, Jane Lynch, delivering funny drill-sergeant one liners as Calhoun, and an almost unrecognizable Alan Tudyk, doing his best Ed Wynn impression as the flamboyantly sinister King Candy. Sarah Silverman gave appropriate spunk and wry humor to the mischievous Vanellope VonSchweetz, but hearing that raspy adult woman voice coming out of a rosy-cheeked little girl is a bit distracting at times. The chemistry between all of them created some truly funny and sweet stand-out moments, and my only complaint is that there wasn't enough time to fully develop everyone. Specifically, Calhoun is pretty underplayed, and while there are many obstacles, a real villain doesn't emerge until the last fifteen minutes of the movie .Wreck-It Ralph is an inventive story that presents a rather literal take on destiny (it's in your code!) finding your place (being a bad guy isn't so bad if you feel loved), and what it means to be a hero (surprise, it's your friends, not a shiny medal). I recommend this film to all fans of animation, gaming/geek culture, and having a good time. It's a relief to find all-ages movies that can play with the formula, and don't rely on swearing or (a lot of) toilet humor to get attention. Disney is always a little ""retro,"" but here, they definitely know how to make it work.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Grown ups will enjoy it too!,"Disney's Wreck it Ralph presents as an animation visual thrill ride through multiple video game worlds, the audience is besot with comic gags and punchy one liners but is ultimately left to believe that while we are all interconnected we also exist within the restricted confines of our own social strata. Through survey of film theories in Structuralism, Constructivism, Post-Structuralism, Post-Modernism, Post-Humanism and finally Super-modernity it may be proved that such children's fantasy entertainment posits social expectations within the impressionable spectator. Wreck it Ralph as a mainstream entertainment vehicle lends credence to the empowerment of the individual whom does not feel accepted by the status quo through recognition that as individuals we must determine our own self-worth within our respective cultures.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

This is more than a game!,"Disney was really well played in visual and in storytelling! They've been making different things and surprising me recently, so I've made myself to be the Disney's fans. I like the old fashioned low definition game, but not that much for the shooter game. Well, Disney did it, connecting the fun of both generations. I thought it would be impossible to gain old people's interest to newer games... Here is the point, if someone ask you to read the books that you don't like to, they have their way! And they do the new leap in storytelling! The games are so memorable, and very stimulating, whilst the story of friendship is so touching, it is well arranged and clear. Sometimes the characters faced betrayal, faithfulness, and complicated. Well that's the friendship! Bringing all games together with fun and romance, without breaking the rules of digital world! Wow! They actually added emotions, their heart and souls, trying to think how were they suppose to make me really love to read books without forcing me to do so...They don't took the games just as the games, they took me into the games and feel it, making me though that I'm one of them! It is truly original and creative! I hope that my teachers can do that way, but I'll recommend them, as well as the readers like you to embrace the friendship and enjoy the movie!

Should have won the academy award!,"I think Wreck-It-Ralph is my second favorite animated feature from Walt Disney Animation Studios from the 2010's second only to Zootopia, because of the imaginative world build off of these games I honestly know very litle about. I guess it's a good sign that even non-gamers can enjoy this movie for what it did.The animation was fantastic with all its vibrant colours and the way the different tones of the different games blended with each other when interacting.Ralph and Venelopy are so good together and King Candy is among the best Disney Villains in recent years. His manipulative personality is so despicable and yet he manages to hide it from the games with his genius plan. No wonder it received a sequel which I haven't seen yet, but will do in time to come.And it is out of this world how Pixar's mediocre Brave won the Academy Award this year, not just over this movie, but in general. In my opinion, this movie deserved the award.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Pushes all the right buttons...mostly,"The term 'Disney magic' has become somewhat of a cliché in the realms of 21st century animation. Nonetheless, it cannot be more so appropriately applied than in the consumption of these two delightful Disney animations on your trip to the nearest cinema. If you are confused by my pluralisation of animation, then I will elaborate by saying that the acclaimed studio treats their audience, old and young, with a heart- warming animated short titled Paperman prior to the 92 minute pleasure that you purchased the tickets for. The 7 minute short serves as the appetiser to the enchanting experience that we so commonly associate with the studio's family films, and there is plenty of room left for us to enjoy the great taste of magic at the conclusion of Wreck-It Ralph.While Wreck-It Ralph pushes many of the formulaic storytelling buttons, you simply do not care. The level of enjoyment is too high to be concerned with attempting to criticise the film for its venture into familiar territory. It still contains a great deal of individuality and originality, primarily through its homage to retro and contemporary video games that many of us know and love. It is recycled material that is so clean and unique that it works as well, if not better than, any original. Put simply, you have fun watching Wreck-It Ralph and I believe no matter the age of the viewer, something will appeal to you in this film. The humour is seemingly directed towards the youngest of demographics for this feature, and I will admit my own slight disappointment at the fact I laughed very few times, a lot less than I was hoping for. However, what the animation may lack in humour, it certainly makes up for in other regions. Many, including myself, will appreciate the nostalgic throwback to video games of the recent and not so recent past. Furthermore, the story of Wreck-It Ralph is exceptionally, and even slightly surprisingly sensational! Each and every element of the plot fits together so incredibly well, that screenwriters Phil Johnston and Jennifer Lee have clearly demonstrated their phenomenal talent to make everything in their story relevant, balanced and unanimously appealing. Similarly with previous Disney animations, they manage to take something from many of our everyday lives, and adapt it by creating and exploring a new world of unequivocal genius. One of the most admirable aspects to Wreck-It Ralph is the way in which different gaming worlds interact with one another, whilst staying loyal to their own arcade home. For instance, those in the title character's game possess robotic manoeuvres, while other games appear as actual modern video game gameplay, and as a gamer, I can vouch that these individual attributes are most definitely appreciated and entertaining to experience. Even the product placement (which I am not generally fond of in film, though understand its use) is so appropriately implemented that even a sceptic can appreciate its presence.If Disney were to instigate a consumer guarantee that stated any audience member may have their money back if they failed to in some way, shape or form, be entertained by Wreck-It Ralph, I can almost assure that the volume of tickets returned to theatre desks would fewer than the amount of times my eyes diverted their attention away from the screen the film was presented on (do note that I did not look away once). Despite quite useless use of 3D (as in 99% of films), the colourful and developing animated aesthetic absorbs your mind throughout, and you leave with the desire to play a video game, or watch the film again; either is likely to entertain. There are only brief nitpicks to mention in relation to Wreck-It Ralph, as for the overwhelming majority of the film, you have a great amount of fun. The protagonist's relationship with the main supporting character is one that is inevitable and frankly cute to see occur. Yet the transition from their annoyance to adoration for one another could have been developed further, to make it more convincing. In addition, the humour is an unfortunate element due to its elementary reservation, though I am just being too critical and will stop typing because overall Wreck-It Ralph is a fantastically pleasurable animated film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Level Up with Wreak-It Ralph,"Wreak-It Ralph is Disney's newest animated film that easily captivates the minds of all ages, andwill excite gamers everywhere.The story's protagonist is Wreak-It Ralph, the villain of the video game, Fix-It Felix Jr. He is alarge kind hearted fellow with a short temper inside a game where all he does is wreak things,and gets hated for it. Ralph begins to dream of becoming a hero and sets out to make this dreamcome true. But once Ralph leaves his game, he sets off a chain of events that may change theentire arcade for the worst.This movie does a great job creating a strong, video game feel. It uses references from old videogames that adult gamers will love, as well as current favorites that will cause children to shriek inexcitement. Any gamer would have tons of fun with this movie with just these references alone,with appearances from classics like Pacman, and Street Fighter 2's Ryu, to the modern renditionof Sonic; it really is a treat to enjoy. But while the movie pushes these references in just aboutevery trailer and advertisement out there, it's actually a solid movie that may survive withoutall the video games. The movie even goes so far as to push past video game appearances andventures into music, where you can expect to see a special guest appearance from an animatedSkrillex, as well as an exclusive song from this popular dubstep producer.Just don't expect a video game jumping, franchise exploring epic. This movie only actuallyexplores two games, and most of the movie ends up taking place in the most annoying gamethat could only be described as Candy Land meets Mario Kart. Plus the other main character;Vanellope von Schweetz, ends up taking over the majority of the movie once introduced. Thiswouldn't be a bad thing if she didn't come off as so utterly annoying, although some peoplearound the theater did find her quite cute. Eventually the movie tries to pick up for lost time forwhen Vanellope wasn't in the movie and this causes the story to drag. If the rest of the moviewasn't so great, this would have killed the movie altogether.The movie overall was fantastic. People will enjoy the movie's colorful visuals, and hilariousword play. So while the movie has a few dull moments, it also has a lot of blood pumpingexcitement to compensate. The movie really brings back the special feeling the most Disneymovies have lost over the years.

Are you a fan of video games? Then you'll love this movie.,"Wreck-It-Ralph was a cool film. The video games made up for this film, Fix-It-Felix and Sugar Rush, are both inspired by real video games that are Mario-related, which are Donkey Kong and Mario Kart. The Sugar Rush also reminds me a lot of the Sweet Sweet Canyon from Mario Kart Wii. There's also another game called Hero's Duty that's obviously Call of Duty renamed. Much like legos in The Lego Movie and toys in Toy Story, Wreck-It-Ralph also bought the rights to show or cameo other pre-existing video game characters, like Qbert and Sonic. They even remembered Tapper! That's a very obscure game from 1983.From what I hear, they actually could afford the rights to show Mario (Charles Martinet) in Wreck-It-Ralph, but had no place in the story for him. They barely even had a spot for Sonic (Roger Craig Smith) in the PSA about dying out of your own game. I really loved this film, but I still wonder how come everybody from all the old 8-bit games (including Ralph and Felix) still has their own modern CGI design on the other side of the screen. I thought Jack McBrayer and Jane Lynch played off each other very well, and this film also made me a fan of John C. Reilly. Vanellope was annoying at first, but then I started to like her more later in the film. She's very cute and she also sounds exactly like Sarah Silverman's Ollie Pesto from Bob's Burgers.I just want to say that I love Wreck-It-Ralph so much and I can't wait for the sequel Ralph Breaks the Internet to come out. All of the princesses from earlier animated Disney films will be in this movie, but I am most excited to see Mario! Maybe he will have an important part in the story helping Ralph and Vanellope. Bonus points if Luigi gets to be included in this. Hopefully Ralph Breaks the Internet will have better execution of The Emoji Movie's plot of traveling through various products, and get to be an admirable video since The Emoji Movie was the 146th atrocity video. I just hope Wreck-It-Ralph 2 doesn't fail like Mulan 2 from destroying the first movie's principles, where Felix feared Ralph was ""going Turbo"" by leaving their video game for Hero's Duty in the first film and Wi-Fi in the second film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

One of the best Girl cartoon characters EVER,"Close to the best cartoon since How to Train Your Dragon, but more comparable to a morphing of Monsters, Inc., Battle for Terra, and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. It will definitely change some best 10 cartoon films ever lists.For 2011-12, there is no competition for this in cartoon animation. Although it will get compared to Brave, that's a relatively normal cartoon by comparison, having only a strong girl character to justify any arguments.The story still centers on video games and Ralph's wrecking fists, but it's the development of ""Glitch"" into a character comparable to Monsters, Inc.'s Boo after about 5 years of growing and a move to an arcade that makes the story more than just some retro video game amusement. It would still be a fun film, but Glitch turns it into a film that should be considered for awards beyond just animation. In some ways, it's a WALL-E prequel.Besides Monsters, Inc., other less known great cartoon films with girl characters among the best ever include My Neighbor Totoro and Nausicaa, both of which are even slightly better than this.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

That's how well they have been brought to life.Each of the main characters of the movie, Ralph, Vanellope, Felix, King Candy, all teach you some little thing that can make you a better person. Even King Candy can teach you a thing or two about how to deal with life's little disappointments.In a world today where the art of story telling is probably dying out with parents having less time to spend with their children, it's nice to see animated movies bringing out values that we should be teaching kids like love, hope, treating people right, never giving up.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Oh the wonderful nostalgia,"Usually when it comes to animated movies, I reserve my highest praise for Pixar movies. They have constantly raised the bar for animated movies for the last decade or so, and the competition has had a tough time getting close with their efforts. That is why I'm so pleased to see such a good challenger for honors, from in-house competitors Walt Disney Animation Studios.The plot works well, focusing on video game bad boy Ralph, who is tired of being the villain and wants to bask himself in the glory of heroes by winning a medal. But what makes this a winner in my eyes is that it manages to capture both the young and the old. The story itself is good enough, but what makes me fall for it is all the connections to the old video games I used to love. Growing up in the 80s and early 90s, I just love seeing the characters I used to know from back in the days, including Pac-man and Q-bert, not to mention Bowser or Dr Robotnik.I really had a good time watching this, and it gives Brave a run for its money being my favorite animated movie of 2012.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Not only do a lot of your favourite icons make cameo appearances, but the 8-bit and 16-bit graphics are extensively referenced too. Not to mention, the wonderfully dated sound effects and tunes. Even with CD technology nowadays, the music back then knocks most of today's efforts into a cocked hat. As I watched it, and picked up all the small background details and little touches, a tear of nostalgia dribbled down my cheek *SNIFF*. A lot of love and attention went into the making of Wreck It Ralph, and it shows.Ah, but does the rest of the film match up, you wonder. Glad you asked... the answer is an emphatic YES. The writing is so good... every character is uniquely interesting in their own way, and their interaction with each other is wonderful to behold. Who could have thought a relationship between a cheeky little girl and a huge, clumsy lug could be so effective? And who came up with the idea of matchmaking a sexy, tall female commando with a magic hammer wielding midget? The fact they do, and it works so well, is testimony to a fantastic screenplay, choc-full of action, wit and pathos. It is also mandatory to watch with a big, goofy smile on your face too.Ladies and Gentleman, I think we have a classic here. (P.S, the short film on the DVD called Paperman. All I can say is WOW.) 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A videogaming movie done right!,"Just the announcement was enough to perk my interest and the trailer was enough to make it one of my highly anticipated movies to watch.I don't 'analyse' movies like other people, I watch them with no expectations and enjoy them for what they are, I watched Wreck-It-Ralph and it did what it needed to. It entertained me thoroughly and did it right.If you're one of those who pick faults with everything, I have no time for you, I found no fault in this movie. It was well put together, the story wasn't stupid and the characters were great. It's certainly not one of those where, what you see in the trailers are the best parts, there are some great sequences throughout the whole movie and should keep everyone happy, especially kids!The 'retro' game characters are obviously there for the sake of older kids and parents/adults and the 'HD' comment was a nice touch to reference more recent games, but it was done just right to attract each member of the family.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"""Wreck-It Ralph,"" released in 2012","Directed by Rich Moore, is a delightful animated film that takes audiences on a nostalgic and imaginative journey into the world of arcade video games.

Reilly), the villain of the fictional arcade game ""Fix-It Felix Jr.,"" who grows tired of being overshadowed and mistreated by the game's hero, Fix-It Felix Jr. (voiced by Jack McBrayer).

Good entertaining movie,I watched this movie today on PC. I started watching this movie some time back but initially I got bored and then I stopped watching it. But today somehow I started watching it and I felt how could I miss this movie earlier. Its so entertaining and has a very good story line. I liked the animation and overall theme about video games. I liked everything about the movie. In fact background music was also good and two songs near the end of movie are also good. A very good movie compared to the recent animation movie released last year. Honestly I would rate this movie far above any good animation movie at this moment I can think of. So you can imagine how well it has gripped my thinking now and I loved this movie so much. Watch this movie if you had played video games when you were younger and you will definitely enjoy this movie.,9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Great Movie, Highly Underrated Must See",This is a great movie to see if you're an adult gamer or if you have children who love gaming. The movie's premises is basically same as Toy Story except with game characters that come to life when the arcade closes at night. However this basic premises is the only similarity and Wreck it Ralph has a lot of unique elements in the story line that allows it to stand out on its own. I really think this movie is extremely underrated and there was a lot of twists and turns in the movie that I just did not predict but the movie really pulled it all together. It was a real pleasure to watch this movie and it caters well to older children and adults.,9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Ehhh....,"This was a really good movie, but I watched it once and didn't really have a desire to see it again. I feel indifferent toward this movie. I don't like the ending and the characters eventually became annoying. The story is very good though, it was fun seeing video game character interact when ""humans"" aren't around. It was sort of like watching Toy Story but the ""toys"" are video game characters. This movie brought out the child in me and I love it for that. But, in saying that I also feel like this movie was a bit unnecessary. I guess it does kinda teach a lesson, ""learn to love where you are and what you have,"" but I don't feel like it did that in a unique way. I really like the movie but I have no desire to watch it, buy it, or tell anyone about it, It's kind of just ""that movie I saw one time, because I was bored.""",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

"""Wreck-It Ralph"" smashes ""Brave"" to pieces!!","Brave sucks BEAR NOSES! Take home that Oscar, Wreck-It Ralph!I just re-watched this film with some friends (who had never seen it before) and I was reminded of how much I loved it! My friends found it pleasantly surprising too! They loved how it was a universe of video game characters that came & gathered together,much like ""Toy Story"". Even with many fictional games being created for the film was quite a talented thing to do! I never thought of it that way before! The villain was interesting, the plot was smart, the jokes were just TOO funny, and all the characters were just all-round likable without being too over-the-top. And that Owl City song at the end certainly was the icing on the cake!How the flying FRIDGE does an unlikable & unoriginal film (Brave) beat a funnier, smarter, enjoyable, touching, & better original film???""Brave"" was so silly, so rushed, so uncomfortable & cringe-worthy & stressful - I can't even remember anything likable about it. Though to be fair, I will say Merida from Brave might LOOK like a creative & interesting princess, but the story was just a MESS! Plus, it's quite hysterical that if the rules apply, if Merida shot all the arrows and won against the others (even in slo-mo. I know, wut??), wouldn't that mean should would have to marry herself?? lol (Hey, ""The Little Mermaid 2"" explored the daughter-mother concept better than ""Brave"".)I call it completely COWARD-like of the Academy to perform this action of giving the Oscar to the WRONG movie! Did they even SEE the same movie I did!?? Put ME on the Academy - I'm sure I could do things a whole lot better.(And no, I'm not one of those who think that ""Leonardo DiCaprio deserves an Oscar"" - c'mon, I have a whole page dedicated to talking about male celebrities who're SO MUCH hotter & talented than him. He doesn't deserve to get a majority of the praise for playing the same shouting, foul- mouthed, insecure, degenerate in so many darn movies! And seriously, his talent really is just limited to shouting)Anyways, I'm SO excited this movie exists, it's a great nostalgia trip to anyone who grew up playing video games, and that 'Wreck-It Ralph 2' is in the works! ""Brave 2"" better not steal the Oscar this time! lolGlad ""Frozen"" won the Oscar Disney SHOULD have for Wreck-It Ralph.9/10PS: Not also do I like this film for introducing me to the talented Sarah Silverman, but the actress herself is Jewish! And I've got quite soft spot for Jewish people - and I never did find her character, Vanellope von Schweetz, at all annoying (like my sisters did). She was just TOO cute, funny, and likable!",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
So good been entertained for years since I was born,"It's such a good movie I don't remember the first time I watched it but I really liked it. As soon as it came to dvd 📀 I begged my Parents to get it for me. And they did, so I was super happy I was so addicted to this movie. I used to watch it every day, This movie is super fun and cool as well. I like all the video game reverences in this movie. There is even Bowser, Eggman, and even Sonic the hedgehog. It's so fun and a cool idea, they work all day. But when it's closing time, they get to relax until opening time. Overall this movie is awesome. It will still make a good family movie even a decade later.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
This movies good and thats good and not bad,"Wow this is my tenth review on IMDb and this film is a great choice to be my tenth review. So my past reviews I did two huge TV shows / will smith film / Rain man / a base ball movie with GINGER Geena / two bizarre Johnny Depp films / one about work being like prison even worse and lastly the one with 14 year old Blonde Reese and now this one my 10th review Wreck - It Ralph.To be honest I thought for sure that the first animated movie i would have reviewed on here would be a Pixar < cause I'm a huge fan of them> examples here are - Toy Story 1 or 2 or 3 or Monsters Inc. / Monsters University ( that i saw the night it came out !!! ) / finding Nemo /a Bugs life and more ..... But before I got a chance to I watched Wreck-It Ralph last night and it steps right up there surprisingly. The movie is about a video game character thats a villain / bad guy in his game wanting to be a Hero and get a medal for once instead of getting thrown in the mudd unlike his co-WORKER Fix-It Felix who always gets the medals and more attention. I have to say the name John C. Reilly sounded familiar to me but i could not put a face to his name but he was outstanding voicing Ralph , I also liked the other 3 Sara Silverman / Jack Mcbrayer and Jane Lynch they all deserve credit.I loved game central station it was cool to see all the cameos of classic video game characters - It was kinda like a good Deja Vu feeling. It reminded me of Toy Story / Monster Inc. and Who framed Roger Rabbit but in a good way though. It was cool to see all them and even hear there sounds/ audio from there games !!!! so cool I'm not even a super gamer - however I have played a little bit of every game. So I totally saw 100 % accuracy of the characters and made me enjoy it more.The world of video games has quite the danger , It seems like determination helped Ralph and friendship with Vanellope who was a quirky little character that added to the story. I liked also how Ralph realized he has to be himself no matter what the situation is. I know I mentioned Jane L. but she gave her character attitude enough be different and give the movie a little edge. Felix and her character Calhoun had a great click and were cute and funny too.SO FINAL RESULT IS - this is a great movie where Ralph has his negatives then positives throughout the movie , has a lot of funny parts , you liked toy story ? then you will like this movie , Great main characters / and comical cameos , The script was excellent and idea was original / I might sound redundant but its everything in this movie i liked and caught my eye. Im shocked this is not from Pixar - However John Lasseter was executive producer so that made me smile as well. Watch this movie its a great a family movie and ranks close to toy story !! key word "" close "" .",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
One of the best video game movies of all time,"Wreck It Ralph truly is one of the best and one of the only good video game movies ever made, and one of the best John C.

A perfect blend of pop-culture and comedy,"It's not often I would give a movie a perfect 10 rating, but after more than a decade of enjoying this film myself as an adult as well as seeing both of my kids fall absolutely in love with it I have come to realise that family films don't come more perfect than this. The 1980s arcade game nostalgia is a bonus for grown-ups but the story in no way relies on it and younger kids will have no problem relating to the characters. I could call it Toy Story with video games but that isn't doing it justice, because I think this film is so much more nuanced. Here, the video game characters have to ""stick to the program"" and serve the players by day, but when the arcade closes they have hopes and dreams of their own. There are themes of friendship, love, loneliness, and more - but what really makes this movie great is the comedy. It's a genuinely funny film, and when you're not laughing, you're smiling. As a dad to two strong, independent girls, it isn't surprising that Vanellope appealed to them so much. She's fun, determined, tough and principled, which for me makes her the ultimate Disney princess. I don't know why this film isn't appreciated as much as some on the Disney roster. If you haven't seen it - give yourself a treat.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Hilarious,"Have you ever felt like you were stuck in a role you never wanted to play? Constantly subjected to scorn and ridicule simply for performing the only task available to you? What if you could change that?Fix-it Felix Jr. has been a popular game in Litvak's for years. The hero and titular character, Felix (voiced by Jack McBrayer) has a magic hammer that can repair any damage done by the game's villain, Ralph. When the game is over, Felix is given a medal while Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly) is tossed off the roof by the tenants of the building he failed to destroy. When the arcade closes and the game is turned off, Ralph returns to his home atop a garbage heap in the nearby dump. For recreation, he visits Tapper's, a vintage game that assigns the player the role of a bartender. Also, upon our introduction to the story, Ralph makes his first visit to a support group for video game villains. Among the villains in attendance at Bad-Anon, we see M. Bison and Zangief from Street Fighter (voiced by Gerald C. Rivers and director Rich Moore respectively), a ghost from Pac-Man (voiced by Kevin Deters), and a zombie (Raymond Persi). During that meeting, he announces he no longer wants to be a bad guy. With the 30th anniversary of Fix-it Felix Jr., the tenants throw a party and ""forget"" to invite Ralph. Ralph crashes the party, in every sense of the word, and leaves soon after. Before he's left, he vows to return with a medal, something denied him by Felix and the tenants of the building he destroys. He seizes the opportunity to travel to a new game, a first-person shooter game called Hero's Duty, when a character from that game passes out in the bathroom. While at the center of Hero's Duty, Ralph is overwhelmed by the violence in modern games and refuses to heed the orders of his superior, Sergeant Calhoun (voiced by Jane Lynch). Once the arcade closes and the game ends, Ralph decides to forgo the usual hurdles of Hero's Duty and steal the medal typically awarded to the winner. After stealing the medal and, unwittingly, bringing a menacing enemy insect known as a Cy-bug with him, Ralph heads to the kart-racing game Sugar Rush. It's there that he encounters the perpetually glitchy and terminally annoying Vanellope von Schweetz (voiced by Sarah Silverman). Despite the initial friction, Ralph and Vanellope (Silverman) bond over their shared status as outcasts.There is, of course, more to the story including Felix's pursuit of Ralph into the various other games and his budding romance with the no-nonsense Sergeant Calhoun, the true origin of Silverman's character, and an eventual revolt in the world of Sugar Rush. All of it, and I do mean all of it, had me riveted. I will say that, as a fan of old-style video games, I would've preferred seeing the character of Ralph travel to more than just the two different games besides his. Regardless of my criticisms, Wreck-It Ralph is hilariously entertaining and fun for viewers of all ages. Check it out.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
For all you guys who grew up with this movie,"Warning: This is a comment full of nostalgia. Why? Oh well, let me answer: Because this is one of the best 3d animation movies made by Disney, apart from the name of Pixar, this is one of the first and most important big successes on 3d animation by Disney. And it is made for both families, children, and gamers.This movie is so good it almost feels like it's made by Pixar, much like Frozen and Zootopia, this is one of the very bests of its time. I would even dare to say it has more depth than Zootopia and Frozen, mainly for people who are gamers; since there are so much easter eggs and carefully added details in this movie, that it's almost crazy.This movie paved the way that, in the future, movies like Sonic The Hedgehog, and Super Mario Bros. Movie would follow. I personally will always carry the experience in my childhood's heart, and the choice of playing Owl City's ""When Can I See You Again"" at the end is a magnificent sensation. I don't consider this last sentences a spoiler, since you have really watch the movie to experiment that feeling.P.

But he ends up learning that he got it backwards. You have to do good things to prove that you deserve the medal. And the medal itself doesn't even need to be real.Half the characters are female, and they have real personalities, not defined by their gender.

Great Fun,"'Wreck-It Ralph' is a Disney movie that could easily be mistaken for a Pixar film. It is about Wreck-It Ralph who is a bad guy in an arcade game who is tired of being the villain and leaves his game to get a medal in order to be respected by the good guys in his game.The film has some great vocal performances by John C. Reilly, Sarah Silverman and Jane Lynch. The story itself is entertaining for both children and adults simply because there are jokes in it that suit both groups. As far as children's films go it is actually quite unpredictable as there are a few revelations and funny scenes that you don't see coming and they take you by surprise. The soundtrack also fits this film perfectly; a mixture of popular songs that everyone will know and enjoy with some other arcade-sounding music that works really well in the fast pacing scenes.Overall, 'Wreck-It Ralph' is a really nice, heart-warming film that is enjoyable for both children and their parents.

'Wreck-It Ralph' Packs a Punch to the Funny Bone and the Heart.,"It takes a while for a video game to be considered ""retro"". For a while, games that feature jumping plumbers, flashing ghosts, and super fast hedgehogs were just considered old and stupid. I think there is a certain amount of time that has to pass before a game reaches retro status. It has to withstand the test of time before they become charming again. Before they are remembered fondly, instead of just being remembered. Wreck-It Ralph does for video games what Toy Story did for action figures. It remembers them fondly and brings them back to life in brilliant computer animation and talented voice work. Much like the way that Tom Hanks was the center piece for Toy Story, John C. Reilly is the mainstay for Wreck-It Ralph, however, he is hardly what makes this movie great. The supporting cast of voice talent, including the saccharin and overly adorable part of Vanellope played by Sarah Silverman, and the comedic genius combination of Fix It Felix, played by Jack Mcbrayer and the strong and hilariously tragic heroin of Calhoun, mastered by Jane Lynch. These two together steal the movie. The story is classic. A misunderstood giant who people cower from based solely on looks and is doomed to be alone forever because of the hand that life has dealt them (ahem, Shrek). Ralph takes it upon himself to try and change his fate so he ventures out of his own game through a very imaginative subway system that connects all of the different games in the arcade. In his travels, he enters into a first player shooter game where he feels alive for the first time in thirty years. On a freak occurrence, he enters into the game ""Sugar Rush"" which is like a diabetic cross between Mario Kart and Willy Wonka's factory. This is where the adventure truly begins. Wreck-It Ralph is colorfully gorgeous in every scene. The story makers work in classic video game characters at just the right amounts, which will appeal to parents taking their kids to see it. A hologram Sonic the Hedgehog, an elegant well spoken Pac-Man ghost, and a homeless Q-Bert are all good for reminiscent laughs that your kids won't understand. This movie will make you want to dust off your old game system and fall in love with your pixilated buddies all over again. Also, it's a shoe-in for best animated feature come Oscar time.Bottom Line:Wreck-It Ralph delivers for audiences of all ages. It brings humor, action, and subtle doses of heart throughout.

Probably the best CGI animated movie of 2012,"This movie is a blast from start to finish and I wouldn't mind seeing it again. When I first saw the trailer showing a CGI movie blending video game characters within video games. I thought it was a cool idea and thought it was going to be a good entertaining flick. But this turned out to be a great entertaining flick. Some reviewers compare this movie to the ""Toy Story"" franchise. I can see the connection but this has enough of it's own elements to stand on it's own without it going in a really gimmicky direction. There is also a bit of emotion and heart to this movie and doesn't seem forced in. The protagonists are all likable in there own way and I couldn't help but care for all the main characters in this movie. Overall this is probably my favorite CGI animated movie of 2012.

One of the best Disney movie in sometime.,Like the Emprors new groove and Lilo and Stich this is a different kind of Disney Feature it seems more like a Pixar or Dreamwork Animated Feature. Ralph is a villain from an 80's video game who wants to be a hero because they have more respect and a better reputation he tries to win a medal in another game but gets sent to a candy land like game called sugar rush. There he meets Vanellope Von Schweetz a game glitch or so it seems She gets staticity or buggy at times like a game glitch will sometimes do.Wreck it Ralph's hero Fix it Felix and Calhoun an action game hero go to sugar rush to get Ralph and Destroy a bug creature that got into the game. Ralph and Vanellope bound making a car for a big race but King Candy who is in the race is against Vanellope racing.Video Gamers and vintage arcade buffs will like this there are many old school arcade and modern game references such In the movie Weck it Ralph is celebrating 30 years many video game and arcade characters make appearances throughout the movie. Where Brave a Pixar movie seems like a Disney movie this seems like Pixar or Dreamworks movie It reminds me a lot of Shrek This could be the beginning of a new Animated movie franchise.,9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Crash Bandicoot has sold way more than freaking Qbert I don't thinkg 99% gamers have even heard about him. The music is horrible dubstep music they should have used Crash Bandicoot music. The story tells about some fat loser that wants to be a hero and help some annoying girl that you wish would die as soon you see her- Most the movie isn't even based in real video game its more like candyland movie so they false marketed this garbage to gamers.

First,I must admit i didn't expect this much from this great animation.It is the best Disney work ever if you ask me.At least their best 3d work.They are really showing that Disney is the best,was the best,will be the best and even pixar can't protest as they had only the junk Brave to show to me (i am not proud but my taste in animation is very good,you can ask my friends,family, etc).I am not trying to say pixar is bad,no,I love pixar and also,pixar is a part of Disney after all! It's just that Disney is almost always better to ME. Wreck it Ralph,is the greatest I have seen this year (note that I have seen great things like Princess Monoke,Pan's labyrinth,Inception and .. for the first time this year) and it is not only because I am a gamer.Actually,in my country,we do not have arcades as are shown in this movie. I really suggest you to see it and you will not be sorry. And if you have seen it,rate it 10.Yeah,it may be 9 but how about the people who give it 0 for the reasons i never understood? Just a thing before the end,you will love the sugar rush graphics.I wish Disney could lend some of its great colorful atmosphere to some video games. thanks for reading this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Film Improved As It Went On,"This film got better and better and went along. By the midway point, I thought it was okay, but nothing special, but by the end it turned out to be an entertaining film overall. In another words: a strong second half.Make no mistake: this is a kids movie. However, there are things an adult can enjoy. While I found very few laugh-out-loud things, it still kept a smile on my face for a decent part of it.....and the colors were astounding. Please see this on Blu-Ray, if you have the opportunity. I don't have a 3-D player so I can't comment on that aspect. Bet it looks cool.Overall, a fun film that I'd watch more than once.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
My first ever 10/10 movie!,"I never thought the day will come when I score a movie 10/10.. and this movie?!! I don't like CGI. I like a well-written story with well-developed characters, played by actors who respect their art. I find fault with almost every movie I watch. I didn't plan to watch Wreck it Ralph. I was at a friend's house to use his wifi when mine broke down and he had just bought the DVD. He played it and I was not interested the first minute then I was hooked! The movie is GENIUS Genius in story, story telling, script writing, switching between the world of the tiny characters, in between their little worlds, and then ""our"" world. The script is flawless. The imagery is lovely. ALL the characters all likable. The movie is just hilarious! I am actually going to buy the DVD to watch again this weekend. There is so much going on it's amazing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A Fun & Sweet Film,"Every once in a while a movie will come around that should be a stupid cash grab. A movie which markets what's popular, and dresses it up as a 90 minute blockbuster. But in some cases those movies are treated with so much respect by their creators that the finished product is something too good not to appreciate. Wreck It Ralph is a movie much like that.On the surface it's a film about video games but essentially it's a relatable tale about the quest for belonging. The film is super goofy and has enough slapstick and silly humour to entertain all viewers no matter how old you are. But for me, it's the visuals and the charm that makes me come back to it.Despite the story being quite typically Disney and the themes not being so deep. There is just the right amount of depth to the characters for us to be able to care about them. Ralph is a misunderstood bad guy who wishes to change his path and feel like a hero. But along the way he learns the true value of self worth over seeking approval. It really doesn't matter what others think about you, but it's more about how you view your self and how those who really know you can see you.The animation and character designs are just amazing. It's flawless even down to the movements of the 8-bit video game characters. I also really like the way the movie shows you the view of the characters inside the arcade games. The idea of video game villains having a rehab meeting in the centre of the pac-man maze is a particularly funny little visual.The sound design and voice acting are exceptional too. John C. Reilly and Sarah Silverman put a lot into their roles. The quality of the film is at a high standard as would be expected by big budget Disney flick. The story and the characters however, are what keep this movie standing tall. I think this deserved to win best animation over the less memorable and slightly less impressive Brave, but I suppose you can't win um all. I personally feel this movie had more heart and an awful lot more in terms of content than Brave. But oh well.Just like The Lego Movie, this production team really cared about the film they were making. It was fun and had heart which is the most important thing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Review Singkat,"WRECK-IT RALPH is Disney's latest animated movie about the world of arcade game characters. It's a delightful, morally uplifting family movie.Litwak's Family Fun Center is full of arcade games for all ages to enjoy; but, when the lights go off and the doors close, the characters inside the arcade games live a life of their own. The characters are made of programmed code and can travel between different arcade games through what they call Game Central Station, which in reality is the power strip into which the games are plugged. We are introduced to Ralph, a character in the 8-Bit arcade game Fix-It Felix Jr.Ralph is a big man in the world of arcade games. Nine feet tall and 600 pounds, he's a formidable force. His job is to wreck the apartment building of the locals who are called ""Nicelanders."" As he wrecks the building, Fix-It Felix, Jr. comes in to fix the building. If Felix fixes the building without getting hit by the bricks that Ralph throws at him, he (and the game player) wins, and the Nicelanders then proceed to throw Ralph off the building and into the mud. The Nicelanders then celebrate with Felix and award him a medal as Ralph goes to live in a pile of bricks. This is Ralph's job. After all, he's the bad guy in the Fix-It Felix Jr game.Because of his destructive nature and his social inept-ability, the people of Niceland ostracize Ralph even when the game isn't being played. Ralph even attends a Bad Guys ""Anonymous"" group where one member tells Ralph that just because he's a ""Bad Guy"" doesn't mean that he's a bad guy. However, Ralph is tired of being the one that is never appreciated and always has to lose. Ralph says he would like to earn a medal for once, but he's told that ""Bad Guys"" can't win medals. Finally fed up, Ralph angrily tells Felix and the Nicelanders he's going to go get a shiny medal and that when he does, they will have to accept him.Ralph leaves the world of Niceland to find a game where he can find a shiny medal to award himself. As he travels between different games, he meets a young girl named Vanellope who's even more alone than Ralph is. Through Venellope, Ralph learns an important lesson of helping others instead of himself.WRECK-IT RALPH is highly entertaining. The story is genuinely fun and moving. Also, characters are each unique with their own little quirks and personalities. Children will enjoy the great animation and adults will love the jokes about the games from the 1980s and 90s. Best of all, WRECK-IT RALPH has a strong moral world view of loving your neighbor as yourself, literally ""your neighbor"" in Ralph's case. The movie appears to have a Christian, redemptive definition of loving your neighbor and being a true friend.WRECK-IT RALPH does have a slight ambiguity. Ralph is programmed to be the ""Bad Guy"" in the arcade game and, according to the movie, that's not bad. Even so, in the end, even though Ralph is still the ""Bad Guy"" in the game, the people around him choose to accept him because he chose to act selflessly. Thus, younger children could be confused about Ralph in the end being a ""Good Bad Guy."" There's also some light action violence and some scatological humor in WRECK-IT RALPH, so caution is advised.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Entertaining Every Generation!,"Wreck It Ralph, an animation film which entertains more adults then children. I went to see this film in cinema and the room was filled up with different generations and not one person kept a straight face and did not laugh. Video games comes to live.What more could you ask for.It keeps you laughing constantly. With the voice of Ralph from the fantastic John C. Reilly from the classic Step Brothers, you are sure you love it if you love him. The one thing which was quite bad was the film is in 3D but there wasn't much 3D stuff. They could of made more things pop out, if you get the jist. Disney animationshave certainly made a good film which suits every person.

Wreck-It Ralph - An instant Disney Classic,"Ever since that little alien said ""I'm Lost,"" danced with a Hawaiian girl to an Elvis song, and ended up learning the meaning of Ohana, I'd prayed for another motion picture of pure Disney animated magic to match the instant classic that was Lilo and Stitch. That was October 2002.It's taken ten years for that movie to arrive. It was worth the wait. Wreck-It Ralph is one of Disney's finest creations. Every last one of you has to see this because it's, to quote the critics, ""As phenomenal as Toy Story... Unmissable."" I had high expectations for this, and normally a film disappoints when I do, but this blew them out of the water.I would not dream of spoiling a single moment in the film, because it, more so then any film of recent memory, creates a world of it's own and the rules governing them. Every action every character makes is true to their personalities. In visuals, sound, music (all perfectly balancing the right mix of retro nods and genuine storytelling) it is a triumph, as well as the voice actors' work, who are well-known but not huge celebrities, and never make you think of the actor instead of the character (except for cameo character Sonic, but his voice in the last decade had become infamous for annoying die-hard Sonic fans).Another great triumph is how it mixes the video game nods with it's story, which actually delves into what these character's lives are like when the arcade is closed. The references, both to video games and other films, as as well-structured as those in Bug's Life, Toy Story and all the Pixar classics. No doubt the work of Executive Producer John Lasseter, and Director Rich Moore, a Simpsons and Futurama veteran with several Emmys under his belt.Animation-wise? It's a triumph. Though it follows the more modern CGI rule of animators working on scenes as opposed to specific characters like all the 90's Disney films, the gestures, facial expressions and movements of the characters fit perfectly and make them as believable as fish, monsters, or even robots. Not just the five key players, but others too, showing that the crew love the source material. The design glows, both from the 8-bit graphics we see from outside the game to the fleshed- out interiors. Fix-It Felix Jr. purposefully looks like a not very visually detailed game on the inside. Hero's Duty is a mix of every Sci-Fi FPS out there from Halo to Gears of War. Game Central Station is a vast hub room, and it makes sense.But Sugar Rush, where we spend most of our time, is gorgeous (even if the film only had visuals going for it, there would be plenty of eye candy to behold). It meshes the speed of Mario Kart (the game's fictional release date is, not coincidentally, 1997) with the cuteness of Kirby, feeling like it was from Japan (no coincidence that the film's Japanese title is Shugâ Rasshu, securing at least moderate success for it over there).You can't talk about a Disney movie without mentioning the soundtrack, can you? Not including two existing songs (Shut Up And Drive serves some narrative usage) there are four new songs, one a gritty remix for Hero's Duty, and the other three being credits songs. 'When Can I See You Again?' is to this what 'Down To Earth' was for WALL-E, continuing the story during 3 minutes of a stylistic epilogue. 'Wreck It, Wreck-It Ralph', written by the same people who did the Pac-Man Theme Song, is a single that reveals some fictional back-story for Ralph and Felix. And 'Sugar Rush' makes some inspired decisions, especially being sung by Japanese artists and having some Japanese vocals in it. They are along the line of Tarzan's songs - tasty, catchy junk food. I predict them becoming a guilty pleasure for many.Outside of The Lion King and possibly Dinosaur, Disney scores rarely stick around too long in the viewer's head. Composer Henry Jackman blends video game stylization with standard modern orchestration, and the style dominates, both to it's credit and against it. It certainly helps the movie feel more authentic, though the themes won't stick with many. Then again, hands up anyone who remembers specific cues from the Toy Story films? Regardless, it cannot be faulted, and does it's job effectively, ranging from Carl Sterling territory to full orchestral sections in the more tender moments. The Act III cues, in particular, do everything right (The denouement cue is beautiful, and I love it after one listen).I have several dozen other, well-structured reasons why this film is a masterpiece, but I want everyone to discover all the surprises in it. Decades from now, students will be studying this film's structure alongside Star Wars, Wizard of Oz and Jaws. OK, maybe I'm being too optimistic there, but this is the same guy who has A Bug's Life as his favorite Pixar film, so what do I know? Obvious joke there aside, video game fans will naturally have a field day in the cinema (or on DVD/Blu-Ray - I'm sure, unlike many recent animated films, it won't lose it's impact outside of the cinema).Recommend this to everyone. Don't forget to take the kids - they'll enjoy it almost as much as you will. Even cynical teenagers should love this (I'm still the latter, but not the former). Wreck-It Ralph is an instant classic, and I'm intent on paying it another viewing or two, in the cinema. See it, enjoy the cleverness of it, feel for the 3D characters (structure-wise - I saw this in 2D) and love it. Never take the film for granted, because it's to movies what Super Mario Galaxy was to video games.""As great as Toy Story 1, 2, and 3.""

"Cobbled-together cliché-following script, but very entertaining nevertheless.","Wreck-It Ralph is a video game bad guy (clearly modelled on Donkey Kong) who detests his life as a much-hated dump-living loner and longs to be, instead, a hero who saves the day and is loved-by-all. Better still have a shiny medal to hang around his neck. With this in mind he leaves his own game and seeks a medal in the other games in the arcade.(Naturally by doing so he puts the ""whole of video arcade in danger."")The internal logic of this cartoon doesn't really stand much scrutiny because video game characters don't have a life outside of their games and even if they did this is contradictory in the extreme. I suppose we have to suspend all our facilities as regards belief and logic, but why would a bad guy (created for the purposes of this alone) have a heart-of-gold? While this may be unimportant the film can't even decide on its own internal logic. Why would the characters die if the plug is pulled? Do they die if they have a power cut as well? Equally why didn't they die before they got to the arcade?(This is a movie written by people who don't know their ROM from their RAM?)For those old enough to remember eight-bit games and the early days of computing there are plenty of laughs and references. Q-bert was my favourite. Not a fan of shoot-em-ups generally and they play on screen worse than they do in any actual game. They just don't create any sense of danger. They are simply there to be shot and never seem to do anything to avoid being shot. They are about as menacing as wasps around a picnic.For my money it would have been more fun for Ralph to go in to loads of different games and interact with loads of our old favourites. Here he only lingers in two. Clearly this would have cost a lot more and, who knows, meant having to pay licensing. From the information about the film available here this was one of the original ideas.Ralph is quite a complex character in being a bit stupid (for laughs) one minute and quite cunning (for convenience) the next. I guess that a lot of dim characters are like this in movies, they have to serve the general plot and be whatever is needed. Worse the central character is such a bland retread of Shrek. John C. Reilly's voice performance is simply great though.The King Candy (Alan Tudyk) character seems to be indicating he is gay (lots of pink - sorry salmon - in the castle) and speaks with a bit of a camp lisp. While attacking some prejudices (the girl racers are all bitches ripe to be made good) it endorses others? He is a lot of fun though and adds a tiny bit of danger to a plot where nothing-bad-can-happen-and-we-all-know-it.Too cute and sharp tongued by-half Vanellope (Sarah Silverman) is a would-be racer who Ralph helps and is the co-central plot thread of the movie and while fun and entertaining, what follows is like watching somebody else's video game from over their shoulder.I guess the end message is go and see this film, enjoy it and think about the character references (if you know them), but don't start thinking about it too much. It really falls apart if you do. Strangely for a film about growth and change, the payoff is actually pretty weak. Like many cartoons and animated series the central message seems to be that everybody should know their place and be happy with it. Another cliché box ticked, sadly.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

A unique addition to the Disney universe that I would consider an absolute must see,"Wreck-It Ralph (2012) is a movie that my daughter and I saw in theaters when it first came out, is in our DVD collection and I recently rewatched on Disney+. The storyline follows an arcade character who is sick of being the villain and wants a gold star too, like the hero in his game. He decides it's time to leave his game and try to be a hero and win a gold star some place else. Little does he know his actions may lead to the end of his game and universe forever. Can he work with some old friends, while making some new friends along the way, to achieve his goal and not destroy his game forever?This movie is directed by Rich Moore (Zootopia) and contains the voices of John C. Reilly (Boogie Nights), Jane Lynch (Glee), Sarah Silverman (School of Rock), Mindy Kaling (The Office), Ed O'Neill (Married...with Children) and Dennis Haysbert (Heat).The concept for this picture was very unique and captures the perfect nostalgia elements for people who grew up in arcades or playing video games. The animation was first rate and it was fun seeing characters from so many universes in one movie. It was easy to get lost in every scene. The voices for each character was perfectly selected, as was the soundtrack. I enjoyed Reilly's narration throughout the movie. The settings were really cool and I thoroughly enjoyed watching the story unfold. There's also some great lessons learned in here about giving friends the benefit of the doubt as well as managing your own self esteem.

Fun For Everyone,"I didn't really know what to expect when going to see Wreck-It Ralph this week.The trailer looked promising, but I decided to reserve judgement based on the decline of animated Disney movies over the last number of years, such as the largely unremarkable Cars, Bolt and Toy Story 3.What played out before my eyes, however, was a visual feast that succeeded in achieving what so many classic Disney movies had before it – creating a totally captivating and immersive world for people of all ages to enjoy.Wreck-It Ralph is set in a gaming arcade and begins with a voice-over by none other than Ralph himself, palpably performed by the gummy vocal chords of actor John C. Reilly.Ralph explains that he has been carrying out the same job for thirty years – a job that has seen him play a video game villain throughout this time.We discover that Ralph has been largely neglected by other characters in the gaming world and as a result no longer wants to be a bad guy; he wants to feel appreciated and accepted for who he is.Attending a support group for video game antagonists, Ralph confesses his desire to be the good guy for a change, and deciding to prove himself as a 'hero,' Ralph leaves the world in which his own game is based and travels into other games within the arcade, aiming to win a medal he can bring back to prove his worth.Wreck-It Ralph features a number of stand-out characters, all of which help keep the plot gunning forward at a sharp pace.A striking feature about most of the characters in the film is that they closely resemble the actors voicing them, including Ralph himself and characters Fix-It Felix and Calhoun, played by Jack McBrayer and Jane Lynch respectively.The main supporting character Vanellope, voiced by Sarah Silverman, however, left me a little disappointed as I felt her character wasn't strong enough for the amount of screen time she had.Lovers of retro arcade games will no doubt enjoy many of the subtleties and attention to detail that has gone into planning the arcade universe.It is this attention to detail which makes Ralph's journey all the more enjoyable, coupling a heartfelt and entertaining storyline with an array of breathtaking and colourful visuals.Free-flowing camera sweeps and a series of well-designed shots further exemplify the environment created in this film, leading us to really come away feeling like we have visited the fictional world in which Ralph lives.Wreck-It Ralph epitomises the very essence of family entertainment and overall I loved this movie and would regard it as among the best animated films I've seen in recent years.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

John C. Reilly and Sarah Silverman are excellent,"Thoroughly enjoyable.'Wreck-It Ralph' is very good. At the beginning it feels as if it might just be a video game rehash of 'Toy Story'. However, pleasingly, it does its own thing as it gives a positive message and has more than satisfactory humour.I'm never been a proper gamer, at least not in the sphere of games used here, but I still got a load of the little references. I also like how the world is built, it's silly sure but it's still pretty neat how they tie it all together.John C. Reilly and Sarah Silverman are excellent in their roles as Ralph and Vanellope. It's very easy to care for those two characters, with both having meaningful stories. Jane Lynch (Calhoun), Jack McBrayer (Felix) and Alan Tudyk (Candy) add to the film with their characters - it's clear to see the ode (copy?) to Ed Wynn and his Mad Hatter for Tudyk's role.The animation is nice, while the music - though not memorable at all - is rather catchy and suits the Sugar Rush surroundings in particular.

Excellent apart from violent head punch scene,"The punching scene was a bit too overcooked. The instruction was to slap Felix, but Calhoun punched him in the head with a closed fist repeatedly. Felix barely flinched. Not the best message or idea to associate punching hard in the face, without consequence. It's baffling they felt the need to create such a scene.That out of the way, it's an instant classic. One of the top animated features. The story is original and looks amazing.

A movie about video games...But this one's a good one!,"Wreck it Ralph is a story about a bad guy in a video game who only wants to be the good guy for once. His challenge is laid out for him by his fellow game members, who tell him that if he wins a medal, he can live in the penthouse with them. This causes him to ""Go Turbo"" (Meaning that he leaves his game to participate in another, therefore disrupting the intended way of doing things) to be the good guy for once. However, Sonic the hedgehog clearly states at game central (the Power adaptor where all the games are plugged in) If you leave your game, and die in another, you don't respawn.The premise of Wreck-it Ralph is appealing to everyone. Most of the people in the 20-30 year old demographic will have a good time here, as they'll notice all the little references and memes the movie has to offer, from King Candy entering the Konami Code (Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A, Start) to get into his video game's coding, to the graffiti reading ""Aerith lives"" on a wall. I was also pleased that Disney acquired the rights to real video game characters and not just parodies. It was kind of nice to see Bowser and Dr. Robotnik (To me, he's Robotnik, not Eggman) in the same room.Ralph, Felix, and Calhoun all made great characters. Ralph and Felix made a great parody of Donkey Kong and Mario while Calhoun was a great parody of someone like Samus Aran. They all fit well together. However...The biggest negative was Vanellope. I thought she was purely annoying and I wanted her to shut up just as much as Ralph did. I understand she's not meant to appeal to me, but at least give her something funny to say rather than annoy the heck out of me.One Final Note, Being an Animaniacs guy, I was pretty happy to see that Jess Harnell and Maurice LaMarche had roles in this movie, albeit very short ones. However, I think Harnell had one or two lines and LaMarche was Tapper. Kind of sad to see such talent go to waste.Overall, This movie's worth a view. I'd be interested in a Sequel, and chances are there will be one, maybe 10 years in the future.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Absolutely brilliant, absolutely must see and must own!","Every once in a while a movie will come out of the blue and hit you right between the eyes, in a good way. Wreck-It-Ralph (WIR) is just one of those movies. It is perhaps one of the best movies I've seen this year, and can confidently put in in the top 5 that for the entire year, despite it being a 2012 release.Normally, I like to be as objective as possible, but I must confess a certain degree of bias for WIR for it has good visuals, good characterization, and most of all an excellent story.I state the visuals as being good because that's the best word I can use. They're not stunning compared to other animated movies both old and new but it has been aptly rendered to fit with the video game like feel of the characters.The main strength of the movie is the story, a clever weaving of different video game characters and giving them a more fleshed out and ""human"" quality. The behind the scenes story was refreshing and highly entertaining. I enjoyed how the story created a link between an arcade player and the character he/she chose. There was also a nice blend of various genres of game styles, appealing a wider viewing audience. The clever part was that pretty much anyone could associate with the characters, across genders and age groups, as we've pretty much encountered similar games over the year. Some of the characters were instantly identifiable, such as the Street Fighter characters or Qbert, but others were play on characters so you did have to stretch your imagination and association.The story is very well told and moves at a good pace, never stagnating. It's hard to put my finger on it but WIR had an original vibe to it, even without it being a completely new idea. Think of it as a re-imagining of a fairy tale story, only there isn't a dragon, or a chivalrous knight, or a damsel in distress. Again, it's very cleverly done. The range of emotions that movie displays is also staggering. It has everything for everyone- action, humour, romance, drama.If there is a slight drawback to the movie it would be in the voice over department. I have nothing against John C. Reilly but I felt that his presence took away from Ralph. Every time Ralph spoke I didn't see or hear Ralph. I saw and heard John C. Reilly when I really wanted to see and hear Ralph. A no name but a good voice actor would have been preferable, at least to me. After all in animation movies the characters are promoted, not the actors voicing them. Did mothers and their daughters flock to the cinemas to see Brave because Kelly Macdonald and Emma Thompson were doing the voice overs? I didn't think so either.All in all this is a movie that everyone should see. The endearing quality of the movie will have you smiling, laughing, tense, frowning and maybe even in tears. I have been recommending this movie to everyone I talk to about movies, and if you read this review and watch the movie I hope you do to. This movie deserves a rating closer to 9.5 than that overall 7.9 that is stated.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Surprisingly Good,"I didn't see this when it came out because it just didn't seem interesting. I decided to try it this weekend and had zero expectations. I was surprised to find that I really liked it. It was engaging, and I could identify a lot with Ralph. The world where the story takes place was cool - you're inside arcade games. Ralph struggles with being an outcast and the villain of his game, but inside, he's really a kind person who wants to be accepted and included. He tries so hard to achieve this, but even a medal isn't enough. Through putting himself in danger to help a ""glitch"" from another game, he eventually learns to accept himself, and in doing this, the other characters in his own game come to realize his value and what he can contribute. This is worth a watch - it's fast-paced, relatable, and creative.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Incredible,This story truly leaves so much up to the imagination while also feeding you all it can from the actual experience shown in front of you. The characters and aesthetics are so unique and seeing so many characters from different medias was super fun. The villain is truly one-of-a-kinda and amazingly portrayed. I always love the antagonists who do what they do for purely selfish and jealous reasons. It's feel-good family comedy but also dark enough to excite further interest. The blend of environments was also fun to see with the bright and colorful candy world simultaneously existing with the action-fps games as well as the characters from both.

Wrecking the game world,"Disney has done lots of animated films, but their movie Wreck-It Ralph (2012) got my attention and will get your attention, because of how it focuses on video games or mainly old retro arcade games that you would go and play in arcades back in the day; after watching, the movie takes the concept of video game characters being living characters and uses it in a fun and clever way, which is what makes this a great Disney movie. The Disney movie Wreck-It Ralph (2012) is a fun and funny animated movie that people who like/play retro video games or any video games will enjoy watching, other than the fun premise, the movie has great voice acting, fantastic 3D animation, noticeable video game references, lots of funny moments, and a well-done villain; the idea of a video game bad guy not wanting to be the bad guy anymore is a good idea, along with that choice causing everything around him to go wrong, and it is handled very well in the movie.John C. Reilly is great as Ralph making him be a likable character who just wants something better in his video game life, him wanting to be more than just being an unappreciated bad guy in his own game was interesting, and how he goes from the first person shooter game Hero's Duty to the racing game Sugar Rush trying to get a medal proving he can be more than just a bad guy; he was a funny and likable character to follow. Sarah Silverman is very good as Vanellope making her a fun and lovable character who has an ability to glitch, I was invested with her wanting to be a racer in the racing game Sugar Rush and her defying King Candy to be in the race; I like the friendship built with her and Ralph and how he helps her make a kart and get in the race. Lastly, Jack McBrayer is very good as Felix who is a funny character who is the hero in his game and goes to find Ralph to save their game, and he has a lot of moments that were funny that play with how he acts when people play his arcade game; also, a character from the game Hero's Duty named Calhoun voiced well by Jane Lynch, who hunts down these bugs from her game that gets into Sugar Rush, falls in love with Felix, and also has some funny dialogue.The antagonist is King Candy voiced excellently by Alan Tudyk making him an enjoyably silly and weird character who runs the game Sugar Rush, and wants to keep Vanellope from racing because of certain reasons that are revealed; also, the backstory to him is interesting and is clever on how it plays into the premise of video game characters coming to life and moving from game to game. The 3D animation is excellent with how the video game worlds look, how the characters look, and how it shows how everything their world works; the details in the Hero's Duty and Sugar Rush game is fantastic, and the movie has quite a few funny moments and lines of dialogue, with video game references people will notice, and video game characters people will recognize.Disney's movie Wreck-It Ralph (2012) is a great animated movie that is fun and entertaining to watch on how they handle this premise involving video games, which is why this movie will connect with people who play arcade games or just play video games in general; great voice acting, excellent 3D animation, funny moments and lines of dialogue, likable main characters, and a silly but fun villain. For those who play video games and like Disney, I would highly recommend watching this movie for how creative they get with a premise like this, and how they develop the video game world; a great animated movie about video games, this is one of Disney's best films.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

With catchy tunes and an upbeat score, the music enhances the overall experience and adds to the film's energetic vibe. The use of established songs and original compositions contributes to the film's charm, making it even more memorable.

With it being a movie made based on several games, it would help if you were a gamer though that is really really not essential to understanding the movie.

I'm Gonna Wreck It!,"In 2012, the 52nd feature in Walt Disney Animation Studios' lineup was released in the form of Wreck it Ralph. Often regarded as the Toy Story and Who Framed Roger Rabbit of video games, the film is arguably one of the better computer animated features to come out of the Mouse House during the studio's revival era. As a matter of fact, it might be one of the few computer animated films that had to be done in the style as opposed to traditional hand-drawn due to its tribute to video gameplay and nostalgia. So now that the film has been out for over 10 years, has it aged well or is it better off having the plug pulled out on?The film follows Ralph, the main bad guy of the retro arcade game Fix it Felix jr who rebels against his ""bad guy"" role in hopes of becoming a hero. With that established, the biggest theme set in stone is the desire to achieve remarkable attention for one's triumphs rather than being sidelined just for their role, and that's what makes Ralph a genuinely sympathetic protagonist. In addition to John C. Reilly providing a sense of warmth in Ralph's need to do something right instead of just wrecking stuff, the character's journey to become a respected game character is what makes his relationship with the glitchy racer of Sugar Rush, Vanellope von Schweetz, all the more engaging. While the duo's dynamic isn't that different from your typical buddy arc in most animated family films, complete with many juvenile one liners courtesy of Sarah Silverman, Vanellope is arguably the most endearing character in the whole film due to her unfortunate glitchy nature. It's through their differences that makes Ralph go from being selfish to selfless, showing how some bad guys aren't so bad after all.In regards to the supporting cast, one notable player is the repairman Felix, whose status as the hero of Fix it Felix jr makes him naive to Ralph's status yet sincere in how he is willing to do what he can to make things right for others. Sergeant Calhoun adds to the journey by allowing her programmed memory in her game Hero's Duty to work within the plot, and even sharing some small yet cute chemistry with Felix. And then there's the main antagonist King Candy, who's resentment towards Vanellope wanting to race borders on sociopathic, especially once the third act kicks into full gear context. As for the aspect of the film's promised video game character cameos, while some might be gimmicks here and there, a few do contribute to the plot just enough to let the suspense kick in once Ralph runs away from his main game. The cold opening in particular does a great job establishing the theme of keeping the status quo through some famous game villains like the PacMan ghost and Zangief, as if the film is telling you to come for the well known icons to stay for the show.Perhaps the biggest highlight of the feature next to the famous video game characters is the animation and art direction. By mixing a wide array of styles throughout each specific character and world, all of the games in the arcade stick out distinctly from one another. In contrast to Ralph and Felix resembling the more stylized crude designs of old school arcade games, the more polished worlds of Hero's Duty and Sugar Rush feel like the kind of action oriented games people would easily get into with fully fleshed out landscapes and color palettes. The effects animation throughout Sugar Rush displays a lot of creativity the filmmakers put in making the most out of a land made entirely of candy, especially within the context of it being an endless amount of racing courses. Next to Henry Jackman's energized score, the care put into recreating old and newer video game music is a testament to how much love and research was devoted to this ambitious feature. Not to mention, anyone who still remembers When Can I See You Again? Knows this film like the back of their hand.By paying homage to video gameplay in lieu of its engaging story of proving oneself through pride and humbleness, Wreck it Ralph remains as fresh as it was 10 years ago. Thanks to its charming lead characters, colorful cast, and breathtaking attention to both visual and orchestral detail, this might be one of the best video game movies out there. Unless you've seen it far too many times already, it's still worth recharging your batteries to get back at it and revisit this joyful experience, even if you're not much of a gamer yourself. If people still like this film after so many years, how bad can it possibly be?",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Great in many ways,"Wreck-It Ralph is a Disney film that was released back in 2012 which definitely didn't get robbed at the 2013 Oscar academy awards show.While it is your ""I don't want to be the bad guy"" trope you've probably seen a lot of times. This film does it better than others simply due to its brilliant execution and interesting set of characters. On top of that you also have good humor, great animation, and compelling characters that truly makes this a worthwhile animated feature. And this is probably the best Disney film that is not based on various fairytales. Instead, this film is a love letter to video game fans alike.I have very few criticisms. But the biggest one is the fact that Vanellope and Ralph's friendship sometimes feels rushed and misses crucial points but since their friendship ultimately becomes something heartwarming, it's forgivableRating: 8.5/10Sorry if this review is rushed lol.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A wonderful nostalgic treat that makes up for the lack of Pixar greatness.,"Wreck-It Ralph is a wonderful nostalgic treat. I'm not a gamer whatsoever and I gave up on them before the war games became popular but I have to admit I still play the occasional arcade game. Regardless, I loved the way they fit the format of a video game into raising the film's stakes. As a script it's really great, with fantastic puns, cute pair-ups and a thoroughly thought out world. However, as cute as it is, it does feel like it was taking this world and applying the formula. I don't know what it is about animation and their scripts, yes they're the most imaginative but they're also the least brave. It's great to have a tight script that's beat- by-beat on the money, especially if the twists are genuinely surprising and there's affection for the characters but I think it's more in the rigid structure of the scripts rather than the moments themselves. It lacks a certain elegance that makes it potentially inspiring, even if it has great use of escalation, a huge climax and a sweet epilogue. However, I hope this current generation treasures this film as I can imagine it'll forever have that effect on them as Pixar's earliest does for me. I do already want to see it again and I hope it grows on me. It's the type of film that uses a lot of iconography and hopes to establish some of its own. We'll see if it does, that'll take time.edit: And after a rewatch, my appreciation and enjoyment of the film just grows. Previous complaints proved wrong.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

My favorite cartoon movie of all time.,"Wreck-It Ralph is an absolute gem and probably one of my favorite cartoon movies of all time! Directed by Rich Moore, this animated masterpiece beautifully blends nostalgia, humor, and heartfelt storytelling, creating a truly unforgettable experience for viewers of all ages.The film follows Ralph, voiced brilliantly by John C. Reilly, who is tired of being the villain in his own arcade game. His quest for acceptance and validation takes him on an adventure through various video game worlds, introducing us to a vibrant and creative universe. The animation is stunning, capturing the essence of retro gaming while infusing modern flair that appeals to both kids and adults.The supporting cast is equally fantastic, with Sarah Silverman as Vanellope von Schweetz delivering a standout performance that perfectly captures her character's spunky and lovable nature. Their dynamic is both hilarious and heartwarming, emphasizing themes of friendship and self-discovery that resonate throughout the film.What truly sets Wreck-It Ralph apart is its clever writing and homage to video game culture. The film is filled with clever references and Easter eggs that will delight gamers and animation enthusiasts alike. From the iconic characters from classic arcade games to the imaginative world-building, every detail feels thoughtfully crafted and immersive.The emotional depth of the story is impressive, addressing themes of identity, belonging, and the idea that everyone has the potential to be a hero, regardless of their role. The film balances humor and sentimentality perfectly, ensuring that it leaves a lasting impression on its audience.Overall, Wreck-It Ralph is a fantastic blend of adventure, humor, and heart. It's a film that celebrates individuality and the power of friendship while paying homage to the world of gaming. For its stunning animation, engaging characters, and heartfelt story, I give it a perfect 10 out of 10!

"Game Over Man, Game Over","It didn't know what to expect retroactively clambering into affectionate arcade film Wreck-it Ralph. I knew it had been a bit of a cultural phenomenon a decade or so ago but suspected it would be rammed with Disney animation schmaltz. For me though, it ends up being their strongest non-Pixar effort. There are a lot of smart angles crammed into this dusty games cabinet and you can feel the decades that went into hammering out the characters and the plot. Ralph is an unconventional sort of a thing, and I genuinely was taken by surprise by it.

Bulldozing his way to victory,"After a stomping success in the States, this witty retro gaming homage is the first bow in the Disney Animation Studios' arrow to be as ardent and artistically ballsy as the work from those neighboring Pixar bigwigs.John C. Reilly heads a staggeringly good voice cast as the eponymous Ralph, an oafish behemoth who has spent the last thirty years as a bad guy in an old fashioned arcade video game. His daily routine sees him having to smash up an apartment building, only to find goody-goody superbuilder Fix-It Felix (voiced by 30 Rock's Jack McBrayer) come whizzing in to repair the damage. An outcast amongst the rest of the game's characters, Ralph sits in on existential Bad Guy group counselling classes. While he may have friends in fellow heels Dr. Robotnik and Bowser, Ralph wishes that he could give up on the villain's life entirely and switch over to the light side. On a pursuit to prove his valor, he wanders across various gaming platforms on the hunt for a honorary golden medallion, which sees him taking orders from bossy Sergeant Calhoun (Jane Lynch) in a Halo style shoot-em-up; to meeting kindred spirit Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman), a lost little girl stuck inside a sickly sweet K- pop parody racing game called Sugar Rush.If, like me, you spent many rainy day hours festering in front of a gaming console, you will simply adore this film. The first twenty minutes are brimming with nudging sight gags that pay homage to old greats like Space Invaders and Sonic. Directed and co-written by Rich Moore (The Simpsons, Futurama), Wreck-It Ralph successfully adopts the Toy Story model by being genuinely universal; entertaining both for the nostalgic Generation X adult audiences and their iPad wielding children. It's artistically ambitious too, embracing the old fashioned, staccato movements of 8-bit arcade games in one scene, and then moving to contemporary, HD fluidity in the next. Equal parts traditional and transgressive, it means that the impressive 3-D rendering benefits the story, rather than impinges it.Another huge achievement is in the pitch-perfect casting. Reilly is sublime as the downbeat hero at the heart of the film, perfectly complemented by Silverman's shrill as precocious girl- racer Vanellope. Fans of the recently terminated NBC series 30 Rock will cherish hearing McBrayer going full-on Kenneth mode as the ebullient, Super Mario styled Felix, and Lynch, well, Lynch is always fantastic, isn't she?It won't turn you into a blubbering mess like the regular gushing Pixar fare, and the story of heroism and friendship is hardly revolutionary, but Wreck-It Ralph is a defiant and highly entertaining passion project. Similarly to Sony's fantastic Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs, Disney have created a CGI animation feature which will eventually become known as a retro cult-classic.More reviews, interviews and other film stuff over at www.theframeloop.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
An excellent movie for kids and adults alike,"I didn't read any reviews or watch trailers before I went to see this movie in the theater so I expected it to be a regular kids film with a silly story, action and fart humor. My expectations were utterly smashed right from the beginning as the movie revealed itself to be a bow to both the good old and modern times at the same time. I've grown around video games and arcades and this movie is full of those and characters from popular titles. It's part of the pull - you try and see how many you can spot and recognize. I laughed out loud how humor was made out of these characters that would never get a chance to meet otherwise. The jokes very pretty brilliant and yes, there was a few that I just didn't find funny, but that is humor often is - you bundle up a lot of ideas that you think will make people laugh and some of them will hit while others miss.The story in the movie was interesting and full of twists. You can call it a bit predictable, but hey, kids are supposed to be able to follow it too. The animation was smooth and pretty. Effects and styles were used appropriately in my opinion. Sound effects were fitting also. Because I went to see this film with a few kids, we had to go see the version that was dubbed in Finnish. The voice acting was fitting in that version, but I always prefer the original one and sadly I can't comment on that here.All in all, if you or your kids like video games this movie will rock for you. That is not to say that you must be a gaming addict to enjoy this one - it's just a nice bonus.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

I actually stayed awake... and it wasn't bad.,"This movie was a pleasant surprise. I went in expecting to fall asleep as my fiancé (A big Disney fan) enjoyed her movie, but it really was better than expected. I think the reason I liked it was because it did not take itself very seriously like other pretentious movies nor was the plot inappropriate for the target audience (like falling in love). It was a simple story about immature characters learning a little more about what life is really like and how unfair it can be then growing up a little by the end. I think this would be a great movie for young kids and for us... older kids, we can always enjoy remembering our childhood and how we learned those very same lessons in a less stressful and more forgiving way (movie rather than real life). There was no over the top bloody killing scenes or silly overdrawn dramatic dialog nor artsy fartsy elements, just a story about a guy who was bored and wanted to make friends only to find that that the best friend was the one who understood him best, not the ones he tried to impress. It also teaches that you don't have to be famous and win medals to be important and that hard work and cooperation is required to make the world go round. All good lessons for kids. Maybe I am a sap but since stories cant surprise me anymore, I would rather there be a good lesson rather than nothing at all like most movies today.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

It is a destiny of him. He could not be a hero and disliked from people. It is so sad. However, he find out it is the work only he can. My favorite point is not only story. I like colors of this animation. In Vaellope's car race game, the colors are very pink! It is so cute.I recommend you this movie. Please watch this movie with your family. It will have enjoy time.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"A fun, entertaining adventure","This film is about a villain in a video game wanting to be good, so he can be liked and recognized by his fellow game characters.Looking at the video game simulations at the beginning of the film, it is plain that the gaming world has gone a very long way in advancement. It's nostalgic top see the old plated characters, or as the film says, retro characters. the story is great, it contrasts squeaky clean games and violent games, and exclaims what the world has come to (in Disney's point of view anyway). The subplot of seeking recognition from purrs is likely to touch many hearts, and give adults done food for thought as to what people would do to get recognised. I enjoyed this film a lot.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Good, but could have been better","I put aside playing video games a number of years ago, but all the same I sat down to watch ""Wreck-It Ralph"" with a smile on my face, because I was anticipating nostalgia from seeing references to video games I used to play. As it turned out, a feeling of nostalgia did go through me a number of times, but there were other good things about the movie. The animation is excellent, and there aren't any dull spots anywhere in the story.However, all the same I did feel that the script should have been worked on some more before the animators started to bring the story to life. The premise doesn't feel totally original - sharp viewers will recognize elements from other family movies ranging from ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" to ""Toy Story"". Another problem is that there are some noticeable gaps in the story, where linking footage seems missing. (This may be because the movie as it is runs over 100 minutes, quite long for an animated movie. Maybe some cuts were made during production.) The biggest problem with the movie, however, is that except for the characters of Wreck-It Ralph and Vanellope, there is not one likable character in the movie. At least, when it comes to likable characters that are given some depth and personality.I suspect that these problems won't bother (younger) kids in the audience, who will probably gobble this movie up. As for older kids and adults, while they may see the same problems as I did, they will all the same find the movie okay. There are a lot worse family movies out there.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Nothing special..,"I dunno why it has such a high rating, maybe nostalgia or for gamers or for kids etc. Well to make to it short this film wasn't for me I dunno what was particulary good about it but for me it was an alright film.A fine story with some flaws but has good worlbuilding and atmosphere. I hoenstly didn't like the characters that much. Ralph acted pretty dumb but had good development throughout the film. Vanellope was annoying as hell but had solid motives. And the side characters were decent. Visuals were amazing, the details for each of the game and the animation was smooth and crisp. And lastly very good music with ok voice acting.Overall a semi enjoyable film but it was 50/50 for me.Memorable: No Rewatchable: No",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Very hit and miss,"I wasn't particularly excited when I heard about wreck it Ralph. Now I've seen it I feel the same.It seems throughout this film that Disney has lost confidence in itself. The film has a panicked thoroughness together feel about it. Rather than focus on plot and animation, it seems to try and be funny and fail. Now there are funny parts in it, and their are some truly hilarious bits, but for every joke they got right, there is a joke that falls flat. And unfortunately they stand out and have nowhere to hide.The animation is OK, but not as good as either tangled and frozen (Disney's other 3d animated films). This wouldn't be so bad but it is a long way off either of them and thus falls flat.But the biggest problem by a mile is the plot. Without giving away any spoilers I will just say it has a similar feel to despicable me or mega mind. Being the most recent of the three it feels a little recycled, and while the other two are strong compliments of each other, this is left in their dust.Having said all that their are points to compliment this film on. In places it is truly hilarious, he idea of the characters being from various computer games is clever, and surprisingly this film does play a little on the emotions. There are moments of genuine heartbreak, something Disney has been afraid to try in recent years.The saving grace of this film is glitch. ( she does have a really long real name but for he sake of the review I'll call her glitch.) for one she has a real expressive voice, also something Disney have failed in recent years. It's through her we get the real laughs so she does stand out. But it's her innocence, and her quite real struggles that is a stroke of genius. Seeing her befriend Ralph through a child's eyes and seeing him slowly being one over by her makes this film watchable.To sum up. It's not a complete waste of time but a long way of classic",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
The Story Of A Regular Guy Just Looking For A Little 'Wreck-ognition',"The year of 2012 was a wicked one for both Disney & Pixar as the two animation studios attempted to emulate the other one's forte in their very own features. Pixar's Brave marked its first foray into fairy tales, a subgenre that Disney pretty much owns, while Disney's Wreck-It Ralph employed Pixar's own formula of observing life from a different perspective, this time exploring the world of video game characters.The story of Wreck-It Ralph follows its eponymous character, an arcade game villain who is tired of playing the bad guy over the years & dreams of becoming a hero. Things are set in motion when he sneaks into a different game to win a medal of heroism but inadvertently unleashes a serious threat that could affect the entire arcade and ultimately crash-lands into another game where he meets a young ""glitch"" who makes him realise what it is to be a hero.Directed by Rich Moore, Wreck-It Ralph begins really well and brims with a big splash of nostalgia for grown-ups & an inviting enough world for rug rats. Many notable characters from classic video games make their brief appearances plus it also incorporates their unique characteristics into the narrative. However, the second half of the story fails to live up to its brilliant first half and suffers from an overdose of sweetness that nearly ruins the whole picture.There are still a whole lot of positives for the arcade games it puts on screen are refreshing to look at, the script is sharply witted although there are some moments when it feels a bit too forced, the animation is top-notch for the images vary from 8-bit arcade games quality to modern console HD graphics yet there isn't any friction between the two distinct visuals for its integration is seamless. And the character of Ralph is quite relatable, features a surprising depth & a well-defined arc.Where the movie loses a few points is in the storyline set in the candy-coated cart racing game as that sugary sweet world & the characters it inhabits become annoying real soon. The vibrant, vivid colour palette, the kiddish humour & juvenile figures is more appealing to the younger audience. It does help in further developing Ralph's character arc but the sweetness is a tad too much to bear at times. The voice actors do a good job in their given roles, with John C. Reilly being the standout choice.On an overall scale, Wreck-It Ralph has something in store for viewers of all ages, is a wonderfully animated tale that's full of colours, joy & nostalgia, effectively delivers on the entertainment scale, and sensibly covers the themes of responsibility, identity & isolation. Smartly balancing the retro & new school vibe and featuring a tale that's approachable, accessible & amusing, Wreck-It Ralph is a definite surprise from Disney and would've left an even bigger impression if it hadn't gotten a bit carried away. Nevertheless, absolutely worth a shot.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Beautifully nostalgic,"A very enjoyable animation with a kind of cautionary moral that we should be careful what we wish for, as it may have unintended consequences. Beautifully nostalgic and respectful of the 8-bit past of our youth. Worth a watch for sure.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Change my settings of bad guy,"Ralph was bored to be a bad guy in game, and he decided to take a tour around the video game world. The idea really attracts me. And I'm glad that the side of Ralph and Felix is not just simply exchanged, so that to avoid a vulgar background.
Vanellope is an impressive girl.
By the way, I miss my console, seeing so many familiar characters.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
