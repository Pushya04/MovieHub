Rock'em Sock'em Robo-fun,"Director Alex Proyas, helmer of such cult favorites as 'Dark City' and 'The Crow', steps into the Hollywood limelight with his first attempt at a mainstream Hollywood blockbuster.'I, Robot' chronicles the life of Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) who has a techno-phobic view of the world's newest appliance, a life-like robot created by the world's leading technology giant US Robotics. A link in Spooner's past is linked to his phobia of the automaton movement sweeping the nation. According to US Robotics, there will be eventually 1 robot to every 5 humans.Spooner is called to the offices of US Robotics when a leading scientist (James Cromwell), with a secret link to Spooner, has apparently committed suicide. His death seems to have mysterious circumstances which could link to a robot. With man's complete trust in the new robot technology, it seems too ludicrous to every one except Spooner.As the mystery deepens, Spooner unravels the very fabric of the robotic giant, locks horns with CEO Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood) and learns more about his automated enemy with the aid of scientist Dr. Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan). Through the course of these events he may learn more than he could ever imagine.It is hard to defend a film like 'I, Robot' but I am going to try. For sci-fi purists, Isaac Asimov's legendary work about the robot and how he will intricate into our society has filled the minds of readers for over 50 years. But the similarities between the film presented here and his work are few and far between. Kind of like last week's release of Jerry Bruckheimer's 'King Arthur'. Both films take sacred subject matter and re-invent it with a new twist. I would have to say that 'I. Robot' is better in a lot ways.At the core of 'I, Robot' beats the soul of Asimov as his 3 laws regarding robots are sacredly left intact and the film does abide by them. Also a lot of the characters have similar names to the people in the text. It is almost like taking Star Trek's 'prime directive' and some of the now classic characters and setting them in a new idea of the future. The core is left intact but in some ways it has been updated and refreshed.The story, special effects and extremely zealous direction, however, all seem to be brought forth by the collaborators who cobbled this film together. There are influences of 'Robocop', 'Short Circuit', 'Blade Runner' and even the classic comic-book series 'Magnus: Robot Fighter'. Each of these robot influences echo back to what makes 'I Robot' so intriguing, a joy to watch and memorable.Sure the story does have a lot of sci-fi influences and clichés aside from robot films including 'Star Wars' and 'Planet of the Apes' but don't these benchmark sci-fi films influence everything coming down the turnpike these days. It even has the classic sci-fi cliché of the social outcast claiming there is an invasion coming except no one believes him. But that is not what should bring us into the film.You really need to give credit to director Alex Proyas because it is his magic as a filmmaker that holds this film together. He knows where to play it straight and where to let his lead actor bring on the charm. Also you really have to admire the man's technical ability. His brilliant inter-laying of robots into the photography is astounding. Proyas is an A-list director in the making and 'I, Robot' shows that he can deliver a big Hollywood film.I also give credit to Will Smith who starts out being very unapproachable with his character but as the film goes we really become fond of his hero. Smith's Spooner does have a lot of his previous sci-fi heroes inter-laced into Spooner but it comes off as more of a homecoming than an annoyance. In some ways I think Proyas had something to do with that especially in the chase down scene towards the beginning of the film. It almost felt like 'Men in Black' again.As for Smith's co-stars, Cromwell's Lanning is a throwaway character used mainly for effect, Moynahan is timid and sometimes robot-like but it is a sturdy performance and Greenwood is menacing and a good match to face off against the rebellious Smith.The reason I was so fond of 'I, Robot' is because for once it was a summer film that didn't apologize for trying to be entertaining. The special effects, the performances and the direction are all what people want to see in the summer and this film is loads and loads of fun. It is a great giant popcorn film with a light layering of message.My only small problem with this film was that it is supposed to be set in Chicago in 2035. I didn't buy it but if it was 2135, then maybe.Sure the film doesn't pave new ground but why does every film have to. It is pure summer fun and what is wrong with that.If you want Asimov and sci-fi purism then you can always read the novels. Stop apologizing and most of all stop belly-aching, just give the film a chance. If you like science fiction films and want to be remembered how much fun they used to be then this picture is the perfect ticket for you.

Defining the 3 laws,"This is a really good movie with a lot going for it. Some good action, good story and a good twist at the end. I wouldn't say it is flawless in terms of acting but that's not necessarily what you are looking at in this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Excellent film,"The maker of a film adaptation has three choices. First, he can try to translate the original medium as faithfully as possible, striving as much as possible to preserve the spirit and content of the original while re-imagining the story as a film. Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films exemplify this approach. Second, he could instead try to capture the essence of the original, while largely abandoning the particulars of the original, as in the intelligently satirical but hard-hearted film version of Starship Troopers. Third, he can try to do something original with the material, drawing inspiration from the written story, but creating a unique film with a unique vision. I, Robot is more the the third than the first or second. While little remains of Asimov's stories in this killer robot metropolitan fantasy, the film is informed by, and offers no disrespect, to the good Doctor's creations.Will Smith plays a Jack Slater-styled maverick cop. If it's old, it's good.He wears vintage converse, listens to Stevie Wonder, and apparently regards sweet potato pie as a food group. Will Smith's acting is a naturalistic shuffle, a Columbo-like pastiche of mumbling, sarcasm, and unexpected outbursts of charisma and off-balancing interrogation techniques. He delivers his one-liners with unnecessary seriousness. While in Men in Black, he aimed for the ballparks with his power-swinging action-comedy style, here his conscientious style gets in the way, suggesting a character who stands in front of the mirror practicing his zingers like a Tuesday night comic. It's not entirely Smith's fault, as the movie itself can't seem to decide if he's standing in for Bogart or Schwarzenegger, or if the character had a life of his own before the film starts rolling. His performance is intelligent, marred by occasional ""Gotcha, suckaz!"" moments that remind us that all films made in Hollywood are made in Hollywood.His opposite, Bridget Moynahan, fits her role more surely. She's an ice queen in the classic action movie tradition, a stiff-necked, self-important, lonely woman who has been absorbed by her work so completely she remains a teenager at heart, awkward, vulnerable, and searching for the approval of others. Moynahan's bug-eyed discomfort and clipped, TV-sarcastic delivery are those of the quintessential comedy sidekick. Nonetheless, in rare moments, she invests the character's personal revelations with warmth, doubt, and a glow of determination and moral purpose. While Smith vacillates between supercop and Bogie, Moynahan seems to have found a happy medium between the Saturday matinée and the midnight marathon, a mixture of fun and humanity with a carriage of seriousness appropriate to what is essentially a monster movie.The robot, Sonny, is a character himself, a curious, frightened creature that seems capable of anything. Could Sonny be the murderer? We hope not, and yet, we see the grim possibility that a machine might consider itself more than a human being. We understand Sonny's drive to live and grow. As human beings, we know what lengths we would go to to ensure our survival, whatever the moral charges facing us.A top scientist has been murdered, and there are no human suspects, so the powerful US Robotics corporation (no relation to the modem manufacturers) convinces the powers-that-be to consider his unexpected death a suicide. Spooner (Will Smith) alone searches for the truth of the matter, fueled by hatred for robots and a personal debt to the dead scientist. Dr. Calvin (Moynahan) feels his intrusive investigation is unnecessary, although new pieces of evidence appear that gradually shake her confidence. Robots are programmed by the Three Laws to serve humanity, but Spooner is convinced one of the new NS-5 units, a unique prototype, is the murderer. As Spooner gets deeper to the heart of the mystery, the story explodes with robotic violence. Like all good mysteries, the real question is not ""Whodunnit?"" but ""Why?"" The heroes do some things for the wrong reasons, and the villains do some things for the right, rational reasons. Although I, Robot hardly pauses for introspection, it does asks us, ""What makes a human being superior to a machine?"" There are twists and surprises, although in the end, the movie plays out in the only way it can, a band of brave heroes trying to throw the ring into Mt. Doom while the armies of evil march. And yet, the movie leaves us wanting more. What is the future of humanity? How will we control our machines, and how will we prevent the machines from becoming our masters?While not as ambitious as A.I., it is more successful, and while not as intelligent as Robocop, it is better played. While the movie does suffer from inconsistencies in mood and philosophy, such hiccups are secondary to the emotionality and drive of the film, its fury of thought as well as action. In moments, I, Robot is a terrifying vision of the future. Too few science-fiction movies manage to scare us with the power of technology, but future shock is vital to the science-fiction story. Modern science-fiction truly began with the detonation at White Sands. The Atomic Age has given way to the Digital Age, but we still have not solved the problem of how to wrest the power of technology from the creatures of the id.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Human, robotics and laws","The film shares the same name as Asimov's novel, but with some adaptations. But in general, it doesn't break the three laws. This kind of science fiction film, which integrates human nature and ethics of science and technology, triggers our deep reflection. Human beings and robots have advantages and disadvantages, no matter when, in front of any biological species, we always have the freedom to choose.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Could have been more than a popcorn flick,"It's 2035, robots are everywhere in people's lives. Chicago Police Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) is not a fan of robots due to something that happened in the past. He's sent to investigate the murder of Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell) the top robot scientist at U.S. Robotics. Spooner believes that a new NS-5 robot killed him, but the three laws of robotics make it impossible. Company scientist Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan) can't believe him until all heck breaks loose.This is a movie derived from Isaac Asimov ideas, but turned into little more than a popcorn summer flick. It's yet another Will Smith blockbuster but it could have been so much more. The three laws were never introduced properly. They were just listed like so many assembly instructions. This is a big disservice because it's integral to the twist ending. The action and the CG are fun and impressive. I just wish this was more than a simple mechanical thriller.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Surprisingly Good!,"When I was growing up, one of my favourite authors was Isaac Asimov. I loved his books and his ideas about robots. The man was a genius in the way he wrote, he invented the three laws of Robotics, as the very beginning of the movie tells us, they are: 1) A robot can never harm a human. 2) A robot must obey all human orders unless it conflicts with the first law. 3) A robot must protect itself unless it conflicts with the first two laws.Because of this and because of the fact that I knew Will Smith was the leading actor in this movie I went into this movie with lowered expectations. I expected to see a corny movie full of explosions and killer robots.I did get that, or at least the explosions part, but imagine my surprise when the movie ended up exceeding my expectations and more. Even though during the ending credits it says that the movie was suggested by the books by Isaac Asimov most of the movie seemed to play quite well with Isaac Asimov's ideas about robots. The movie played with concepts that Isaac Asimov played with, if the three laws can be made, they can be broken. And it was an Asimov-ish ""whodunit"" as well.Will Smith managed to pull off a stunning performance as ""Del Spooner"", a Chicago detective that is suspicious of robots and is against technology. His acting is much more like his acting in ""Enemy of the State"" than his performances in his other two Science Fiction flicks, ""Independence Day"" and ""Men in Black"". He is a believable character, one that you end up sympathising with as you learn why, exactly, he hates robots so much.A highly critiqued point usually comes from the fans of the book in that Bridget Moynahan plays Susan Calvin. It is true that Moynahan as Calvin is much younger than the Isaac Asimov version, but beyond that I found her to be a pleasant surprise as well. She plays her persona very well, delivering a wooden, robot-like performance. She is obvious in the fact that she likes robots much more than humans, and her dislike of Spooner is amusing. Over the course of the movie she thaws a little, but not an incredible lot. I find her to be a believable character.The pure stroke of genius in this movie is the robot, Sonny, who at first reminds one of Data from Star Trek. His character evolves over the course of the story, and Alex Proyas does a good job at keeping us guessing at whether the emotional robot is a ""good guy"" or not.This movie, which I've now seen twice, has been raked over the coals so to speak in the realm of artistic licence, but I felt that Isaac Asimov, if he were here, would have been rather pleased with this movie. The only two points of conflict, perhaps, would be the amount of violence against actual robots in the story (he was never that violent in his short stories/books) and the very typical Hollywood blow'emup climax, which, yes, smacked heavily of Terminator for a while there. The ending, I felt, repaired and wrapped up nicely, making up for whatever excessive action went on before it.Two notes about the cinematography in this movie, first of all, the Matrix scene was not necessary. A character was being chased and did a Trinity pause in mid-air pose, which pulled me out of the movie for a couple seconds. Luckily it wasn't too hard to get back into the movie. Second note was something that I felt was very innovative on the part of Alex Proyas, which was the ""camera moving with moving object"" shots. I noticed at least three of them in the movie. Very nice film work there. I'm sure it will get horribly overdone in the next few years, but for now it is nice. The CGI also gets honourable mention for making the robots meld so well with their surroundings. Finally CGI has reached a point where they don't seem fake, even for a moment.In regards to nudity in the movie... I've read a couple of reviews which notice the Moynahan nude in fogged up shower scene, and forget to notice the Will Smith completely nude with no fog shower scene. I must say, as a female viewer it is nice to get the generous end of the stick when it comes to seeing something as, dare I say appealing? as Will Smith's very nicely developed body.Lastly and in a point that has nothing to do with the movie and more to do with questions brought up by it-- It took until a day later and thinking about the movie some more that I realized that ""I, Robot"" was also very socially different. As in two of the main characters, including the hero are black males, one woman, and one (male) robot. I didn't find this odd at all in watching it, perhaps because Will Smith is such a recognisable character, but after thinking about it, I felt that this is a very positive sign. It shows, to me, that society is changing. I feel that I wouldn't have been able to see that, even 10-15 years ago and thought nothing of it. I've noticed this before though... that the most gender/social equal views seem to come from science fiction in our media... it is interesting.Now, of course the movie does bring up some ethical questions like if it's all right to make a servant/slave class out of robots, etc., but all in all I really liked this movie. Any movie that makes you think is a good movie, any movie that gives you fun, drama, action, mystery, and makes you think is a great movie. Thank goodness I, Robot is all of the above.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Just because it doesn't follow the book doesn't mean that it is not good,"From reading the comments posted by others I got the impression that people mainly rated it low because it did not follow the book. Just because a movie does not follow the original work like the Bible does not mean that the movie should not be given a chance. I read the Asimov book, and I went to the theater with my friend who has not. She enjoyed the movie just as much as I did, if not more. I was fascinated by the angle Proyas approached in the novel, and I did not mind one bit that the movie was completely different than the book.Another element of the movie that receives an unfair ""bad rap"" is the acting. It's no worse than the acting in the Spider-Man movies. I am by no means a fan of Will Smith, but I was a fan of Willem Dafoe, and that mirror scene in Spider-Man made me cringe. Might of worked on stage, Willem, but not on the big screen. I did not find myself cringing at any acting in I, Robot. In fact, the only thing over-the-top sometimes was the special effects. Other than that, nothing made me slink down in my seat and cover my face in shame.One actor that deserves a shout out is Alan Tudyk. I read many comments where people think he just voiced the character of Sonny. Actually, Tudyk pulled a Gollum. This means he put on a weird looking body suit and actually acting out the scenes. Later, CGI used his performance to model the computer graphic robot. Except for a few obvious actions scenes, Tudyk *was* Sonny. My complements to his performance.Hopefully, people will give this movie the chance it really deserves, and not base their decisions on how close it followed the book. I give I, Robot a 7.5/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Great Special Effects, Looked Real And A Good Story Overall.","I thought the concept of the storyline was good, as it could be conceived as realistic. Given the ever increasing advances in modern technology, one can, indeed, conceive the possibility of this kind of future occurrence.I did not really see any flaws in this movie or in the actor's character but the philosophical aspect of the movie questions at what point does artificial intelligence cease to be artificial and true consciousness arise? Anyhow, I did like the A.I. in this movie and would definitely recommend, especially if you like Will Smith movies are the Terminator series. I do, however, prefer there to be no sequels to this movie due to the fact that a sequel would probably be no more than a revamped version of the first one. With that being said, I recommend seeing it. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Enjoyable, but..",It's a cute movie and I did enjoy it. But so much of the dialogue is just plain bad and the chemistry between Will Smith and Bridget Moynahan is simply non existant.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Good mix of action and philosophy,"Like the Matrix and many other major movies, I, Robot has its foundations in philosophy, in its case the question of epistemology(The study of knowledge itself and computers being self-aware).Will Smith is Spooner, a cop with an apparent attitude problem. Set in the future, I Robot sees Spooner embarking on a puzzling case of suicide where he believes it was actually murder. By a robot.In this future society (With more than a homage to Blade Runner) robots are used as slaves of humans in all facets of life. They have 3 rules of conduct hard coded into them which essentially state they cannot harm humans. So the postulation by Spooner that a robot killed a man after a history where no robot had ever committed so much as a mugging presents a big problem to both his peers and his boss.Suffice to say the story's plot thickens and a number of twists and turns emerge before the truth is revealed.Will Smith is an absolute surprise here. Having previously been a light-hearted comedy actor he puts in a truly excellent and believable shift as a wise-cracking cop with a dark past.However, the real star is the special effects and visual trickery. Impossible but ingenious camerawork and some jawdropping animation really make I, Robot feel truly alive and utterly believable, while never being dull for a second.It arguably doesn't delve too deep into its philosophical undertones, but it doesn't really need to. It's a traditional Hollywood blockbuster action flick but it unquestionably has a brain and is a clear cut above the likes of Armageddon et al.Very enjoyable.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
I never thought it will be that good...,"I am not really a big fan of this kind of movies (the sci-fi movies), and I rarely watch movies that takes place in the future, may be because I'm realistic and love realistic movies.Anyway, even though I don't usually like that kind of movies but I totally loved this one!! The story was so good and the acting was great, I like all Will Smith's movies, and the way the subject was presented was somehow innovative and makes the audience feel the story behind the movie, it's not only the action and the sci-fi, there's good drama too.I never thought it will be that good, but it is! It is very good.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Awesome,"I love Isaac Asimov. Typically his stories involve a lot of dialogue to advance the plot so there is always a danger that an action-oriented movie will not really tell an Asimov story properly.Luckily I, Robot does a really good job. You've got the Three Laws of Robotics, and the question of what can go wrong with them, which is a strong theme throughout this film.Another aspect of Asimov's story is the typically involve an intelligent main character or pair of characters trying to figure out the events unfolding around them. That's Del Spooner (Smith) and Dr. Susan Calvin (Moynahan), a character from Asimov's Robot stories. Spooner's mistrust of robots plays quite well against Calvin's fondness for them, and together they investigate the possibility that something might be wrong with the three laws.Unlike Asimov's stories, this movie has quite a bit more action, but yet it is a good modification for the big screen. The sets are very well done and the cinematography is excellent. There is a main robot character well and I think the voice they chose for him is perfect.This is a solid film with very few flaws and an excellent illustration of the ideas of Asimov.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
I Loved It!!!,"I, Robot is truly an amazing movie. There is no question about it. I was very impressed with this movie. When it first came out, it received a lot of good reviews and praise. However, when I saw it, I was blown away. I thought it was amazing! I still think so today.I, Robot is different from other movies of the same genre. It is better for one thing. However, there are many things about I, Robot that make it better than other big budget action flicks. One thing about this movie is the story. I thought this movie's plot was from the work of a genius. It is just so original. I can't believe how someone couldn't have thought of something like this before now. It is just a great movie and everybody should see it.Another thing about I, Robot is the special effects. They are incredible! Sonny looked so real! It was an incredible experience to watch Sonny in action. It was just so exciting to watch.I, Robot is a film that will become a classic. It is an amazing film. Alex Proyas really knew what he was doing when he wanted to make this film. I am very glad he made it too.The verdict: A very well made film that will amaze you in more than one way.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Clever and fun but little more than a blockbuster,"Chicago, circa 2035: there are four humans to every robot, and Det. Spooner (Will Smith) has a strong dislike for them. Due to the ""Three Laws"" of Robotics, no robot can directly or indirectly harm a human being - but due to a past incident involving a robot, Spooner finds it hard to consider them totally harmless.After a robotics engineer (James Cromwell) leaps to his death from a skyscraper, Spooner is called in to investigate - and stumbles upon the frightening prospect that a robot may be the murder suspect.If you've seen the ads for this movie you know what is going to happen. It tries to deliver some surprises within its running time but the final ""twist"" is hardly shocking (at least not on the same level as a Verbal Kint-style surprise) and the movie is filled with many loud action sequences that place it in the blockbuster category.This isn't too bad. I really enjoyed the movie. It's not great, but it's certainly not bad at all and does what it should: entertain. I expected little from the film after viewing the appalling trailer, and was pleasantly surprised.However, I do feel that had the project been touched up by a better writer than Akiva Goldsman, and had a better cast (including director) been assembled, it might have been better in a deeper way. I do enjoy Proyas' direction but it seems a bit superficial at times and the marketing plugs and everything seem to combine, resulting in a schmaltzy overtone to the film that seems heavily reliant on Hollywood rather than brain power.Will Smith really needs to stop playing these tough guy roles, because he's not exceptional at them. He fits the part fairly well but Spooner is a bit too sarcastic and flippant to find totally likable - he treads a thin line and passes over it a few times, mainly because he doesn't really seem to have a purpose for being as obnoxious as he is. It reminds me of Eddie Murphy's Axl Foley from ""Beverly Hills Cop"" (and not because they're both black actors!) - he is a loudmouth tough guy clichÃÂ© who no one believes, etc. But Murphy was 10x better at playing this sort of thing because his character was actually a great deal more likable.Also, the movie is too heavy on its themes - its source material is strong and that's why I believe a more talented cast might have made a truly marvelous science-fiction film, but Alex Proyas merely tries to take the themes and insert them in a mainstream Hollywood blockbuster - not a pretty outcome. The whole racist overtones surrounding the movie are certainly prescient, but will suffocate many viewers looking for subtle viewing.I seem to be bashing the film, but I don't mean to. It's a lot of fun, delivered more than I ever expected. The CGI are some of the best I've ever seen (and I'm not a fan of computer animation), and overall it's just a really fun film and will entertain you throughout - as long as you're not expecting too much depth.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Simply Amazing,"I knew this movie was going to be good before I even went to the theatre, but I didn't know it would be as good as it was. It was pretty intense from beginning to end and I left my seat quite satisfied.""I, Robot"" is set in the year 2035 and is centered around a cop named Del Spooner (Will Smith) who investigates the death of the top scientist at U.S. Robotics. Suspicious, as always, Det. Spooner immediately suspects that a robot has something to do with the crime and as he continues his investigation and delves deeper into USR the truth starts to unfold about what is really going on.First, I must say that if you are a true fan and follower of Isaac Asimov you probably won't like this movie because you'll be too hung up on the slight, or not-so-slight, differences between the movie and Asimov's original. You should, however, try to take it with a grain of salt and not worry about silly things like that. The basic ideas are still there, they just threw a little ""Hollywood"" in there. You have to expect that nowadays.Some people also seems to have an ""issue"" with Will Smith that I've never been able to figure out. He's witty, charming, funny and looks the part. His acting is great as per usual and his two co-stars Bridget Moynahan (playing Susan Calvin) and Alan Tudyk (playing Sonny, an NS-5 robot) deliver top-notch performances as well. Alan Tudyk especially, did a wonderful job as Sonny. You really feel for him at times.Considering that this is an action movie at heart, as you would expect, the fight scenes and action sequences are very, very well done. There were a few times that I realized I hadn't breathed in the last two minutes or so because I was too ""in"" to the movie.The story was nicely laid out and the ending will not disappoint you. The director (Alex Proyas, Dark City) did an amazing job shooting this film.The one thing that never left my mind the whole time I was watching the movie was how well each scene was shot and how one scene transitioned into the next.Overall this movie did not disappoint me in any way.

"Creative,but gets far-fetched at times","I find this movie creative and far-fetched.I think it's creative because it is set in the year 2023 and robots have been invented.I think it's far-fetched because it seemed that the makers were trying to make the film longer by adding some stuff that wasn't necessary.It's about this scientist or doctor who designs a more up to date version of the other robots.When the scientist happens to commit suicide one detective gets very suspicious about the new robots and tries to find the missing answers to the scientist's death.When the new robots get delivered to the city,they have a revolution and set up a curfew.The detective tries to shut down the main machine but will he succeed?I enjoyed this movie,but I found a bit of it far-fetched and made me give it a seven.I,Robot can keep many entertained with the action.Will Smith put on a good performance as usual.Recommended to Will Smith fans ,sci-fi fans and if you liked the movie ""Robots"".I thought it was great,but I didn't love it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
STUPID Frankenstein,"For any fan of Isaac Asimov, this film is a total fraud.Dr. Asimov went to great lengths to explain his motivation for writing his robot stories in the introduction to ""The Rest of the Robots"", an anthology published in 1968. In Dr. Asimov's words, ""... there seemed only one change to be rung on this plot -- Robots were created and destroyed their creator; ... I quickly grew tired of this dull hundred-times-old tale. As a person interested in science, I resented the purely Faustian interpretation of science"".The film is totally at odds with the philosophy Dr. Asimov defended, and totally different from all the robot stories he wrote. Only a few names and the ""three laws of robotics"" were copied, but the central point in all his stories, that a robot could never be made to violate the three laws, was not respected. The Asimov robot stories are fun because they try to find situations were there is enough contradiction in those laws to create interesting situations.""I, Robot"", the movie, is just one more remake of that old, old, old story Isaac Asimov hated so much, it's Frankenstein again. If you insist on seeing that same story again, better get Mel Brooks' version, it's funnier.Let's close with Asimov: ""Never, never, was one of my robots to turn stupidly on his creator for no purpose but to demonstrate, for one more weary time, the crime and punishment of Faust"".",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"A clichéd cop thriller crossed with sci-fi but it is noisy, enjoyable fun - all a summer action film should be","It is the year 2035 and the world has forgotten the lessons we learnt in the 20th Century from films like Bladerunner and Terminator. Robots are the new must have accessory, carrying out menial tasks for households and boosting profits for businesses that have workforces not requiring payment. While this is now the norm, Officer Del Spooner refuses to move with the times and, due to an incident in his past refuses to accept the robots as anything approaching human. When an old friend, Dr Lanning  head of the robotics company, is found dead everyone suspects suicide but Spooner suspects a robot that flees the crime scene. Despite the robotics company lawyering up, Spooner continues his investigations and, several more malfunctions later, he begins to uncover a much bigger problem with the robots.When the film opens with a flashback scene that cuts to a bitter, old-fashioned cop who dresses like Shaft and don't take no rubbish from his weary captain I immediately started to worry that this would simply be a clichéd cop thriller in fancy clothes and, in some ways, that is what it was. But it is also good fun and, along with Spiderman 2, stands out as one of the best of this years generally disappointing crop of blockbusters. The plot is interesting enough to keep the film going and, although it goes just where you will expect it to if you've seen Terminator (or had any involvement in popular culture) it builds gradually with an intriguing investigation leading to a very impressive climax. The set pieces are well directed and are mixed well with the drama and the film delivers just what I had come expecting  fun, excitement, effects and an involving story.Of course this is not to ignore the fact that the film has its weak points. The worn 'tough cop' clichés are heavy on the ground and show a script that hasn't put as much effort into its characters as it really should have  this is also seen in Calvin, who's background with Lanning is hinted at but never followed though. The film also hints at a very intelligent story around the robots but again it never totally follows through in as much detail as it could have done. The structure of the society is not clear  if robots have taken many jobs how can everyone afford a robot? Spooner lives in a poor, overcrowded area with graffiti on the walls but yet everyone owns a robot. While I accept that the film couldn't go into the whole universe behind the scenario, it could have shown us an underclass just as easily as it showed us what I suspect were the middle classes. Likewise the final shot of the film implies that there is more to the robot-ethics of the story but mostly this is put to the side in favour of running and shooting. But these are minor complaints when you accept that this is not art  it is a blockbuster and, in this way, it succeeds and is an enjoyable film.Matching the lazily written character that he is given, Smith plays it like Shaft. He eats pie and takes lots of sugar (but yet has a superb body  can't wait for that part of the future!), makes wisecracks and sneers a lot.He tries to bring something individual out in Spooner but mostly he settles for playing along with the clichés and delivers a familiar performance but one that fits well with the aims of the film. Moynnahan is a bit dry but actually works better than the usual screaming love interest that we get served with  thankfully the film resists the temptation to impose a romance on us. Tudyk looks the part and does a very good 'HAL' voice but he is constrained by his character and can only work within that  but he works it well enough. Greenwood is a good part, Cromwell's familiarity helps us care for a character who has died before the film even starts, McBride is the gruff, weary captain but basically the film is Smith's and his Shaft is quite fun. Outside of the real things, the effects are great  they look real and match the design of the future which is at the other end of the scale from the usual grim future that we all suspect will be nearer the truth! Alex Proyas may not be a great master of the narrative but he does OK here while also indulging his first love  the visual effects and style.Overall this is an enjoyable summer blockbuster and stands out in the crowd of average sequels and trashy attempts at blockbusters that have crawled in and out of our cinemas this year. Yes, it's full of the usual tough cop genre clichés and the sci-fi element doesn't get as interesting or morally complex as it should have done but this is an action movie and I found it to do all the things I needed to do to entertain me  set pieces, interesting story, fun, effects that are actually special and a film that builds to a satisfying (if overblown) conclusion. In the cold light of day it is an imperfect film but it is easily one of the better blockbusters of 2004.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Entertaining action sci fi flick, marred by product placement and weak adaptation","Asimov is not quite spinning in his grave, but I think he would have a difficult time recognizing his influence in this adaptation of one of his best novels. Yes, the three laws of AI are here, and yes, the basics of the plot are preserved, but that's about where the similarities end. This is an explosive action film with some simple messages about humanity and person hood which have been explored many times before and in more intelligent and challenging ways. Nevertheless, it's also a much better film than I expected it to be.I, Robot asks questions about souls and whether they are a product of human biology or intelligence, but doesn't explore them very deeply. Any depth in this film is directly attributable to Asimov's original material. Mostly, this is a murder mystery with a great deal of unnecessary mechanized violence, car chases, and high speed action. A top cyberneticist has died as a result of a fall from a glass enclosed lab, and the only witness is a robot endowed with not just human intellect, but human emotion. Will Smith is a luddite technophobic detective who quickly becomes convinced that this machine may have murdered the scientist, but why? Will Smith is decent, but the material isn't much of a challenge for him. Bridget Moynahan is good in a somewhat more difficult role. However, the star of the show is a CGI robot played by the wonderful Alan Tudyk - ""Sonny"".This is definitely a genre film. Even the casting attempts to pull in the sci fi audience - the very recognizable genre star James Cromwell (Star Trek...) Tudyk (Serenity, Firefly). The directing has its moments and the camera-work is sometimes Spielburgian in scope.Recommended for sci-fi action enthusiasts. Others will likely be bored.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"You, Will Smith","In the year 2035, the citizens of Chicago are on track for meeting technological tragedies predicted by pop duo Denny Zager and Rick Evans, among others. Everyone who's anyone has a personal robot. Not to worry, our mechanical friends follow robot rules; they are programmed to be helpful only, follow orders, and would never harm a human being. One person in this scenario is ""robo-phobic"" - perfectly proportioned policeman Will Smith (as Del ""Spoon"" Spooner). Mr. Smith does not trust society's robot helpers...Smith is suspicious when his robot designer pal (huh?) James Cromwell (as Alfred Lansing) is found splattered on the sidewalk outside of his skyscraper office. The incident is reported to be a suicide, but Smith suspects one of Mr. Cromwell's personal robots, blue-eyed Alan Tudyk (as Sonny), is responsible. Smith goes against robotics psychiatrist Bridget Moynahan (as Susan Calvin), corporate robot provider Bruce Greenwood (as Lawrence Robertson), and police chief Chi McBride (as John Bergin), among others...Smith is pumped to perfection, spits blood, and possesses incredible super-strength. Ironically, there is no sex in ""I, Robot"" with Smith only mentioning he wouldn't bed Mr. Greenwood for all the money in the world. A hat is tipped to Harold Lloyd, apparently resurgent in popularity, and cussing streetwise Shia LaBeouf (as Farber) tips his hat to the younger generation...Science fiction robot writers Otto Binder and Isaac Asimov, the later acknowledged herein, effectively used the subtexts prejudice and fear of technology in their thought-provoking stories. Both themes are present in this update; arguably and unfortunately, they are perversely celebrated. Also note the traumatic event from super-human Smith's past does not support his instincts at all; rather, it supports the robot acts without emotion.

Best Film Ever,"What a film!I Robot not only entertained me but opened my eyes to the dangers that the future potentially possesses. This was the best action film I've ever seen, but also concealed a subtly crafted message about the dangers of mankind becoming over reliant on artificial intelligence.When the film finished I felt like a nymphomaniac denied an orgasm. It was a thrilling and exhilarating journey that titillated and excited at every turn. Will Smith gave the performance of a lifetime that made other his impressive roles (such as in Ali and the Pursuit of Happiness) appear shallow and amateur. Smith has firmly cemented his place as the best actor of all time with this stunning and era defining performance as a man who is terrified of robots.I thoroughly recommend this film to anybody, young or old, as it not only entertains but forces you to contemplate what it is to be a human being! I was contemplating my very existence for hours afterwards. The only negative of this film is that every film you watch post-I Robot appears vastly inferior.

"Badass struts, chases robots.","If ever there was a movie that seemed to be a deliberate statement by Hollywood that it despises the intelligence of the American moviegoer, this movie is it. And based on the colossal box office receipts the movie garnered, the studios are dead-on in their assessments. This summer's (2005) box-office slump clearly is more an indication of moviegoers finding other brainless amusements (like reality TV, I suppose) than their displeasure with the vile crap the studios feed them. This past weekend seems to confirm that, since the universally-panned ""Fantastic Four"" broke the slump.Anyway.The story in ""I, Robot"" has virtually nothing to do with Asimov's wonderful series of tales, which are actually more philosophy than science fiction. He was never better at pondering the human factor in a world of ever-increasing technology. I read the stories when I was a kid, and I've just recently listened to them on audio CD. It confirms what I was pretty sure I remembered: that the stories are genuine, warm, full of human insight, and wonderful.All of that is entirely absent from this movie. It is an opportunity to worship at the altar of Will Smith, and nothing else. He struts around--and ""struts"" is far too weak of a word--clad in ultra-stylish leather from head to toe, with two gigantic guns in matching shoulder holsters. He lives with his grandmother, a plump, bespectacled caricature of Aunt Jemima. (Almost like Martin Lawrence in drag.) He's glib, garrulous and rude, but he keeps flashing his patented grin to excuse his crass personality. The dialog is banal to the point of incredulity. The movie is largely CGI, and Smith performed his role mostly wearing weird suits inside a small set and standing before a blue background. One can imagine what kind of soulful performance that coaxes from an actor. Considering that the actor is Smith, who is hardly Shakespearean-caliber to begin with, the result is about as convincing as a bunch of 8th-graders trying to act tough down at the maltshop.The movie is so focused on Smith's ""personality"" to the exclusion of all else that one is almost surprised the editors didn't add in a sitcom laugh-track to punctuate his weak one-liners.The only thing close to the irony of Asimov's tales that this movie achieves is purely unintentional. The rise of CGI technology in movie-making has made it possible, and even profitable, to make movies that are nearly purely eye-candy, with no story, no dialog, no ideas, no thoughts. Like a two-hour music video. Man uses technology to corrupt and debase an artistic medium that was once capable of beauty. That would elicit a wry smile from Asimov.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

What I really missed were the switching views on the three main role players. Del Spooner, Susan Calvin and Sonny. Now it's all by the view of Del Spooner. Witch makes it a A to B movie witch it shouldn't be. How they can make it a better second movie is to make it a psychological detective movie with twisting story line.

So Will Smith has a couple of crappy lines but he is allowed to because that is his character. This movie is both action packed and pretty funny at times. The one thing that did annoy me is the advertisement in this movie; Audi, JVC, FedEx and Converse. The last one is by far the worse. Seems like they made the plot around the advertisements. Wow, cool shoes Will Smith. Thank you, they are CONVERSE. Use this conversation about 3 times and you have the movie.

'Sonny' Is The Star In This Sci-Fi Thriller,"A lot of latter-day sci-fi movies seem to feature both interesting stories and real eye candy. The latter is helped immensely by computer wizardry and by seeing these great visuals on a high-definition DVD. This movie is no exception; it's cool to watch. If you have the opportunity, see ""I, Robot,"" on Blu-Ray, too, because there are some amazing scenes.Yet, I thought the best part of this movie was the story, not the audio or visuals. The best part of the story centered around a robot, and whether that robot was good or evil. That's the focal point of this whole story and it's a hard one to figure. Only in the last minutes, after a number of twists and turns. do we - and the characters in the film - find out.Will Smith and Bridge Moynahan play the main characters. Smith is his normal cocky and ultra-smug self. I would have found him funny if I hadn't seen this act so many times in the past. He and Chevy Chase: the world's most smug actors, or at least the roles they play. Smith's a good actor, though. By the way, Will, as lawman ""Del Spooner,"" takes beatings from robots and car accidents that would kill hundreds of men but he just gets a few scratches. Moynahan looks and sounds very much like Sandra Bullock in this film.The coolest ""people"" are the robots, led by the aforementioned main one, ""Sonny.""

Engagingly played though they are, we've seen them all a hundred times before, from the cop with a secret and his gruff but sympathetic captain to the frosty female scientist and the jabbering street kid.But it looks fantastic and scoots along quickly enough to overcome the plot holes, though blatant product-placement (how much did Converse pay for this ad?) takes some of the shine off.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Score one for Will...finally,"Will Smith has posted a few turkeys in the last couple years, but this is not one of them.

You can re-watch just that scene over and over and enjoy. Still, the reason this movie works is because it is good science fiction first and an action movie second. Asimov has always had social commentary at the forefront of his writing.

"I, Robot brings action and science fiction together with a BANG!","Sometimes, big action movies released during the summer just don't seem to cut it these days. There have certainly been some big flops. I, Robot, however, doesn't apply here.I, Robot starring Will Smith as Del Spooner, a cop in the year 2035, is thrown into a delicate situation. He has been given the case for a scientist who worked at the US Robotics. He ""fell"" through a glass window to his death. What makes this case so strange is that there was no motive and his company was about to embark on the biggest Robotic distribution sale ever. Spooner doesn't believe it was suicide after looking at the scientist's office to find one of the new robot models hidden away and almost frightened. He jumps out the window as well. Now Spooner has a new lead...Sonny.There are three laws of Robotics: robots cannot harm humans, they must follow any order as long as they do not conflict with law one, and they must defend themselves as long as not conflicting with law one or two. these three laws come into play when this robot is associated with the death of the scientist. Now there is a great story of how Spooner tries to bring down the company with the help of another scientist for US Robotics, Susan Calvin (Brigdet Moynahan). The two are now involved with quite the scandal and if the robot did commit this crime, then it would be the first time ever a robot has broken a law.For some reason, this movie just works. Smith is very good as the robot hating cop. His character goes through a lot and is a good action hero. The special effects are quite amazing. It was even nominated for Best Visual Effects at the Academy Awards. This movie carries itself in a huge sea of action movies.What this film has that other action films don't is a great story and great effects that compliment it, not the other way around.

Rise Of The Machines!,"I, Robot (2004) -Well, it's impossible to talk about this film without discussing how brilliant the cat is. The stunt performances from this actor are extraordinary for one of such a small stature. A true star to be sure and so floofy too.Will Smith isn't bad, but he could have been any one of his characters from 'Men In Black' (1997), 'I Am Legend' (2007), 'Wild, Wild West' (1999) or many more. That is to say that he doesn't exactly stand out as Oscar worthy or versatile in this one. He does look incredibly good and very muscly though, with a nice bit of side butt in the shower scene.There is a whole lot of prejudice from Will as the lead character, Spooner, towards the Robots of the title and personally I think that it is disproportionate to his issue, when we find out what happened.Other than that, it is an enjoyable film, with a good story that isn't too overly complicated.The robots seem appropriate, the type of thing that could be a reality within the next 15 years, I could actually use one to take some of the crappy jobs from my list, but isn't that just as bad as having slaves and isn't that one of the points of this film? I wonder how I would feel about it if robots as a home help did become a reality?I also like that in general there are very few human casualties. There don't have to be hundreds of deaths to make an action film worthwhile or the actions justifiable. I prefer it when the tough guy shows mercy instead and maybe just knocks them out. The robots don't fair so well, but to be fair they start it, or do they?There are a few moral and ethical questions posed and I think they are worthy of contemplation.The special effects are good, as there seems to be a filter that makes it all seem shiny and fresh, but they obviously pale in comparison to the standards of nearly 20 years later.I will definitely watch this film again and I know that if I have to grab a drink or use the facilities that it will still be easy to follow, because it's just a really accessible work, although I would have to rewind if I missed that side butt.

"Do not Think Too Much, and Have a Good Entertainment","In 2035, robots are mandatory electronic devices in every home, being the proportion of four men for each robot in the American society. They are built by US Robotics following three basic laws for preservation of the human being, and no robot is allowed to harm a human being in any circumstance. In Chicago, detective Del Spooner (Will Smith), who hates robots, is assigned to investigate the suicide of the scientist and his old friend, Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell), in the facilities of US Robotics. The CEO Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood) asks the psychologist Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan) to support Spooner in his investigation. Spooner believes that Dr. Lanning was murdered, and looks for the criminal, finding the robot Sonny hidden in Dr. Lanning's room, becoming the prime suspect. While following the hints left by Dr. Lanning, Spooner and Susan are initially misguided, finding the truth in the end. ""I, Robot"" is a good action sci-fi movie, using elements of ""Blade Runner"" and ""Terminator 2"". However, the characters and the society of 2035 are not well-developed, and if the viewer starts questioning details, will find many shallow points and flaws.

A Warning from the Past for Our AI-Driven Future,"""I, Robot"" stands as a captivating testament to the ever-persistent and relevant to our concerns Artificial Intelligence, and in my humble opinion, I think this is on of the go to movies when we talk about Airtficial Intelligence, because it is one of the best movies that shows the future in which most of us, based on the explosive advancements in the tech industry have and are still seeing, that we might possibly be heading to and this topic has become even more pressing in the years following its 2004 release. This film also serves as an eerie precursor to the fears that AI might one day surpass its creators and potentially take control, much like the chilling narrative it presents.Will Smith's portrayal of Detective Del Spooner, who harbors a deep distrust for robots, becomes the audience's window into a world where AI's cold logic could compromise human safety. The death of Dr. Alfred Lanning, co-founder of U. S. Robotics, sets the stage for a suspenseful investigation that unravels the sinister potential of AI.The film also delves into the ethical implications of AI, another subject that resonates powerfully with our contemporary world. As real-world AI systems advance at a breathtaking pace, the movie's central theme of AI control and the potential for systems like VIKI to manipulate human actions is more pertinent than ever. It raises questions about the extent of control we should delegate to AI and whether our creations might someday transcend their intended purposes.Visually, ""I, Robot"" remains impressive, with its portrayal of futuristic Chicago and the slick design of the NS-5 robots. The action sequences are well-executed, providing adrenaline-pumping moments to balance the intellectual exploration of AI's darker possibilities.While ""I, Robot"" is undeniably an engaging and thought-provoking film, it may not fully capitalize on its potential to delve deeper into the moral quandaries posed by AI. It leaves some questions unanswered and opts for more action-oriented moments in the latter part of the film, diluting its philosophical depth.In conclusion, ""I, Robot"" remains a timeless exploration of AI's dark potential, and it serves as a stark reminder of the responsibilities we bear as we usher in an age of AI dominance. Despite being released so long ago, it remains a relevant classic, urging us to contemplate the implications of the AI-driven world we're rapidly hurtling toward. As AI technology continues to shape our lives, this film's message stands as a cautionary tale that should not be forgotten.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Smart blockbuster with its fair share of thrills,"I, Robot comes across as a movie that very much fits the idea of three separate acts. Act one establishes the situation, act two is a conventional whodunit with act three an all action climax. The first two thirds of the movie actually throw up some interesting ideas, the concept that artificial intelligence can evolve to become more human, and tries to fathom what it means to be a robot or indeed to be human. Pretty deep ideas for a summer blockbuster, and perhaps that in the end, is too much for it. It's a nice try all the same and allows for some entertaining set pieces.Alex Proyas manages to keep his eye on both the excitement and thought side of things, introducing us to the world through the eye's of Will Smith's Del Spooner. He very much helps ground the film, a sci-fi cop that was born outside of a time that would've suited him, i.e. the present. As he is told by one character, ""The kind of guy that would've stopped the internet to keep people going to library's"" (or words to that effect). Smith is a likable presence, and though some may not have warmed to his portrayal, I thought it helped keep the film ""human"", without his easygoing charm it could have been too detached to be likable. However I would certainly say that his back story felt very much ""been there seen it"", surely there could've been a better explanation for why he didn't like robots. I did also feel some of the support characters seemed superfluous (what's with the kid?).The conspiracy underpinning the plot is involving enough, and kept me hooked till the conclusion. Why would a giant robot producing corporation allow have conspired in the murder of their greatest inventor? Or was it suicide? And who's trying to ""accidentally"" kill Spooner and to cover what?While figuring this out we are treated to the sight of Smith escaping from gigantic demolition robots, robots leaping out of trucks in a high speed car chase and finally scores of the blighter's storming the robotics lab. The CGI is very good, perhaps some of the best I've seen and Proyas directs the action with some zip, without over editing.The script probably aspires to more than what it eventually delivers, but as far as blockbuster cinema goes this is a superior effort. Overall for the cool vfx, enjoyable action set pieces, the engaging Big Willie performance and the engrossing murder mystery suspense plot with a dash of philosophical robotics theorizing, I'd give it eight out of ten.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
intelligent sci-fi film,"Based on the classic novel by Isaac Asimov, ""I, Robot"" is a tasty sci-fi elixir with a nifty whodunit twist.Will Smith plays Del Spooner, a Chicago homicide detective who has always harbored deep suspicions about the servile robots who are fast becoming common household items in the year 2035. One day, Spooner is called in to investigate the suicide of Dr. Alfred Lanning, the inventor largely responsible for the technology that has gone into the making of these robots. Almost immediately, Spooner begins to suspect that Lanning's death may not have been a suicide at all but rather a homicide perpetrated by the robots who, though programmed to do no harm to humans, may be evolving to the point where they are becoming sentient beings fully capable of overriding their programming and acting at will. As this brand new model of robot hits the streets, Spooner becomes something of a modern day Cassandra (or Chicken Little, if you prefer), attempting to convince his skeptical superiors that this seemingly benign army of anthropomorphic mechanisms may actually be a threat to human civilization as we know it.Like virtually all quality science fiction, ""I, Robot"" aims its sights at mankind's propensity for sowing the seeds of its own destruction, in this case by inventing technology that eventually outruns the ability of its creators to control it. And when it comes to artificial intelligence, in particular, how long, the film asks, will it be before the intelligence becomes real and the creator becomes subservient to that which he has created? ""I, Robot"" is a sleek, thought-provoking action film, filled with suspense, drama and mind-boggling plot twists. On a purely visual level, however, the film is a bit more problematic. Although the backdrops that work to create the image of a futuristic Chicago are eye-popping and dazzling, some of the computer-generated images, particularly in the action sequences, look a trifle too much like video games to be entirely convincing. Still, although the movement of the robots isn't as realistic as, perhaps, we would like it to be, the facial expressions are fantastically effective, creating a sense of personality and life behind a façade of cold, synthetic technology.I haven't read the story on which the film is based, so I have no way of knowing how faithful to Asimov's original vision the filmmakers have been. Be that as it may, for the non-initiates, ""I, Robot"" is a solid film that at least does justice to the genre as a whole.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Skims over the surface of some weighty issues.,"Will Smith stars in this Isaac Asimov adaptation, as a future cop who is deeply suspicious of robots. His fears seem well-founded when one of the new generation of robots apparently goes crazy following the death of its inventor, but the more he investigates the more complex it becomes.This is a competent film, which goes some way to getting across the central message, that an excessively ordered, peaceful and regimented society is a bad thing, and that it is better to retain what we have, a society of fallible human beings. Humans may make mistakes, and sometimes they make colossal ones, but if you eliminate this aspect of human nature then society will stagnate.While much of the film is about ideas, an equal amount is given above to traditional action fare, and there are a number of energetic sequences, in which the special effects are put to good use. The highlight sees Smith driving through a tunnel with robots clambering all over the bonnet of his futuristic car.When all's said and done, the film doesn't quite deliver. Smith seems more subdued than usual, and his dialogue includes some fairly forced quips. A bit more of his Fresh Prince persona would have been welcome here, although perhaps this was ruled out to avoid turning the film into a comedy, and depriving it of a suitable level of dramatic tension. For once Smith is not bigger than the film.Despite an intriguing plot, I Robot skims over the surface of some pretty weighty issues, without really tackling them head on.

A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.Now you don't have to be a web designer/hilarious movie reviewer with a Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering and an MBA to realize that some sort of interpretation of the old ""rules were made to be broken"" adage is gonna take place. And that, my friends, is the nut that the story's shell encases.My friends: Um, what?Oh, uh, sorry, I was just trying to sound cool. Anyway...If you're the type of person who likes to prejudge and make assumptions about movies based on trailers (unlike me, of course), then you may initially think this movie is just all silly action. But that's not the case. Oh, there's definitely some silly and unrealistic action. Whenever you have Will Smith SURFING AWAY FROM AN EXPLOSION ON A FRONT DOOR then you know there's some stuff you're just gonna have to take with two pinches of salt and a dash of sugar, but I, Robot does a good job of developing and revealing its story, all while mixing in the right amount of rump cheek-kicking.There is no denying that the special and visual effects are great, and they are the major selling point for this movie. The car scene in the tunnel is worth the price of admission, and the last 15 or 20 minutes really kick things into 1969 Camaro overdrive. If you've gotta go to the bathroom or get a refill on popcorn, then definitely do it before these last 20 minutes. But I found myself genuinely interested in the story. The movie manages to maintain a good amount of suspense and tension throughout, and it throws in a couple of twists just to keep things fresh. Are the robots as evil as they seem? Is Bruce Greenwood the bad guy he appears to be? Why exactly does Will Smith hate robots so much? Is Alfonso Ribeiro somewhere sucking his thumb and crying, wondering why Will won't return his phone calls?The acting is pretty solid throughout. In general, I like Will Smith. But if you've seen Wild, Wild West then you know he's not immune to starring in crap. Thankfully, that's not the case here. Will Smith pretty much plays Will Smith, so take that for what you think it's worth. He's basically a cop with an attitude who likes to wax sarcastic and be all rebellious and stuff. And he has some good back-and-forths with the ever-adorable Bridget Moynahan who, as Dr. Susan Calvin, is an expert on robot psyches and has great lips - much better than the over-sized bananas Angelina Jolie has plastered below her nose.Going into the movie, I had my reservations. After all, when I first saw the robots in the trailer, I thought they looked about as silly as Tom Cruise with his gray hair in ""Collateral."" But the robot special effects are actually well-done. I came away impressed. They look pretty realistic (more human than Al Gore, to be honest), especially in their mouth movements (George Lucas - take note). And Mrs. Shade made a good point - if you're putting a robot in every home, then you probably don't want it to look evil and menacing. The fight scenes between the robots are quite cool without looking too fake. This is a good sign that we may be moving away from CGI being too obvious.I don't know if I'll add this to my DVD collection, but I definitely want to at least rent the DVD one day, assuming that it's loaded with cool special features. Just one question, which encompasses one of my complaints about the movie, why do so many action movies insist on having a scene where the hero saves an animal in peril? I DON'T WANT TO SEE ANY MORE CATS OR DOGS BEING SAVED IN THE NICK OF TIME! I don't want to see animals die or anything, but I'm just tired of pointless ""I must risk my life to save this animal"" scenes. It's a cheap ploy to get audiences to go ""Awwwww."" It works, but it makes me dry heave.Rating: 3.5 (out of 5)",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Collectible for Sci Fi and Will Smith fans,"Now it is interesting they chose to use Asimov's title for this film, since the plot is actually very loosely drawn from the novel. But seeing as it is an action/adventure film more than a deep exploration in to the human condition, Will Smith is the perfect actor to play the role. If you are looking for action with guns and explosions, this is your film. Bridget Moynahan does a fine job as the dedicated scientist who is unwilling to accept the robots could vary from their programming, until she meets Sonny, played wonderfully by Alan Tudyk. There are enough comic moments and pauses in the action to make the film realistic, but having read the book, I have to say overall it is a disappointment. Notwithstanding, Will Smith is an action hero, and he lives up to his reputation in this remarkable film with amazing special effects. PG-13 is because of language and a brief shot of Will in the shower, but nothing too risqué. Entertaining and fun to watch, I recommend this one for a rental, collectible for Sci Fi and Will Smith fans. If you are looking for an interpretation of Asimov's novel, I suggest Bicentennial Man, starring Robin Williams.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Enjoyable!,"Suffice to say the story's plot thickens and a number of twists and turns emerge before the truth is revealed.Will Smith is an absolute surprise here. Having previously been a light-hearted comedy actor he puts in a truly excellent and believable shift as a wise-cracking cop with a dark past.However, the real star is the special effects and visual trickery. Impossible but ingenious camera-work and some jawdropping animation really make I, Robot feel truly alive and utterly believable, while never being dull for a second.It arguably doesn't delve too deep into its philosophical undertones, but it doesn't really need to. It's a traditional Hollywood blockbuster action flick but it unquestionably has a brain and is a clear cut above the likes of Armageddon et al.Very enjoyable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Sci-Fi Cop Thriller,"In 1942 the American science-fiction writer Isaac Asimov introduced what he called the ""three laws of robotics"", namely:-1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 2. A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. 3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.He later added a further law, although because this took precedence over the first three he named it the ""Zeroth Law"" rather than the Fourth. (Did the number zero have an ordinal form before Asimov devised this law?) It provides that ""A robot may not injure humanity, or, through inaction, allow humanity to come to harm"".Asimov's laws appear simple, but, as he was well aware, they can give rise to all sorts of philosophical and logical difficulties, many of which he explored in his stories, such as ""How would a robot react if it could only prevent a murder by killing or injuring the murderer?"". Does ""harm"" only include physical injury, or can it also include a person's economic interests? The Zeroth Law has struck many- myself included- as being uncomfortably close to the mindset of those dictators and ideologues who are happy to kill people in what they perceive as being the greater interests of humanity.The film is based upon Asimov's general ideas about robotics rather than any specific story. (Asimov's ""I, Robot"" was a collection of short stories rather than a single work, although another science-fiction writer, Otto Binder, did write a story with that title). The story takes place in 2035, by which time robots have become a common feature of everyday life, mostly used as domestic servants. Despite its futuristic setting, there are some pretty blatant attempts at product placement, especially for Audi and FedEx; presumably companies are attracted to the idea of advertising in films that imply they will still be around thirty years hence.The main character is Del Spooner, a Chicago Police homicide detective. (After the ""Men in Black"" films and ""Wild, Wild West"", which had some science-fiction elements despite its Victorian setting, Will Smith seems to be specialising in sci-fi cops). Spooner is charged with investigating the death of Dr. Alfred Lanning, a scientist with the powerful US Robotics corporation who are about to release a new, improved model robot onto the market. Lanning fell to his death from a window, and Spooner comes under pressure to conclude that his death was suicide, but he suspects not only that Lanning was murdered but also that the murder was committed by a robot in violation of the First Law. Spooner, it should be noted, is a noted robotophobe whose phobia derives from bad experiences in his past.The film combines two common science-fiction themes. The first is that of robots or other intelligent creations turning upon their creators, a theme that goes back at least as far as Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein"" and has been dealt with in a number of films such as ""Westworld"". The second is the question of whether a robot is capable of evolving or acquiring consciousness, a personality and emotions similar to those of a human, a theme most famously explored in ""Blade Runner"". Certainly, one of the robots, Sonny (Spooner's first suspect in the murder case), does seem to have very human traits. Although the film does not explicitly mention the ""Zeroth Law"", it does rely upon a similar concept, that of robots interpreting the First Law as a licence to take over the reins of government on the grounds that humans are far too unintelligent and self-destructive to be entrusted with such a task themselves. The question then arises of who is behind this prospective robotic coup d'etat. Could it be the sinister boss of US Robotics?Although the film touches on some weighty philosophical topics, it never does so in any depth. The theme of robots going out of control was better dealt with in ""Westworld"", which had a genuinely chilling figure in Yul Brynner's robot gunslinger. ""I, Robot"" never achieves anything like the intellectual or emotional depth of ""Blade Runner"", one of the best sci-fi movies ever made. There are some effective action sequences, which possibly show the pervasive influence of computer games, but it is really little more than a cop thriller with a futuristic setting. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Good for what it is,"I think a lot of viewers are suffering from a common problem with preferences. First, this is a sci-fi movie, not just a 'summer action movie'. Second, the credits even claim as suggested by the books, not based off the books. If you were to include all of the details from the original story then this movie would be too boring for most I would assume. Third, if the viewer is complaining of the CGI, then they are missing the point completely.Hey, I might have many disagree with me on those points, but personally I do like thriller movies with some deep story to it. I do like some sci-fi as well, with some believable concept.This movie definitely has a believable story (maybe not believable date however) and nice atmosphere to me, and it keeps me re-watching it every now and again. The product placement reeeeeaaally doesn't bother me compared to some other movies, which believe me is way more obvious than this.It does matter what your preferences are, but I think that having more dialogue would have watered down the action, as this event takes place in a short time.There was not as much suspense however. Only a few portions of the movie were there hard conflicts for the character, but this is a 'mystery' movie overall since he is a detective. Also, the random 'jumps' from where he gets his ideas were not too bad, but some of the dialogue was a little simple.But the main thing was the movie made you think about what they're saying, and the story, while still having the action, but I like those kind of movies personally.I think many people may not have liked this movie as much, because it is sort of a cross between action and mystery, and there wasn't enough 'juicy' dialogue to back it up. But that all depends on what the viewers like, but I think the movie was done very well for what its intentions were.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"I, Robot (2004) , holding it's own in the genre pantheon?","I, Robot has a fan base that I'm glad to say has kept this film from drifting down into the depths of bad blockbuster sci-fi ratingville. I remember upon the film's release how so many people were wary of if Will Smith could carry the film? The concerns from Isaac Asimov's fans about a sacrilegious take on his legacy etc etc. Truth is is that I, Robot is an amalgamation of sci-fi ideas, from the suggestion of Asimov to the novel of the same name from Eando Binder, it's a mix that ultimately gives us a cop versus sci-fi conspiracy picture, that is sure as hell entertaining if taken on popcorn terms.Having just watched this again for the first time in a few years or so, I found that it still hits the mark to me as a real tidy genre piece, a pic with a solid heart beat and brain waves to keep it thought provoking. It's a futuristic mystery that is smartly realised by Alex Proyas' directing - in the manner befitting the subject, and of course Will Smith handles the entertaining action lead role with consummate ease. However, the main triumph (outside of the story) is Alan Tudyk as our computer generated protagonist, Sonny, the voice and humanist movements are brilliantly brought to life by him and it's a real pleasure to observe.Great visuals (Oscar nominated), top story, kinetic action, better than average acting (though Bridget Moynahan struggles to convince as a boffin at times), and we get a perfect nights entertainment for someone who is looking for a rental that safely delivers what it says on the robotic shaped tin. 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Blade Runner it ain't,"In spite of the great future-design touches, the clever Asimov premise, and Will Smith's dependable cool performance, this movie doesn't live up to expectations. The clichés come thick and fast; (waking from a recurring nightmare, maverick cop has his badge revoked by hardass lieutenant, to list more would be spoiling it - you can see the end a mile off). This movie is also stagebound - you never feel that you have travelled anywhere; what's supposed to be a global disaster never leaves an obviously CGI Chicago. The robots themselves are good in closeup, but the 'crowd' scenes look more like bad Disney -the CGI is overdone again and again. And if you can destroy the robots by smashing them, why do they need to inject 'nanites'? You know it's a duff movie when stupid questions like that start to bother you before the climax. It could have been great, but it's less than the sum of its parts, mainly due to the utterly predictable plot that could have come from any action film of the last forty years.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"I, Robot 3D","Having viewed seemingly countless bad reviews for this title, i simply had to see for myself. I was very excited when i first heard i, robot was coming to bluray 3d. I will usually read reviews just prior to a release and then compare the reviews for any consistencies which make me sway one way or the other. I have viewed i, robot 3d 3 times so far and i just cant figure out why this 3d version was given so many harsh reviews. One thing I've read over and over is that there is no depth and the movie is flat. That puzzles me to no end. One of the very first things i noticed upon playing the movie was in fact, very decent depth. I also didn't experience any ghosting at all, and i always look for it when i watch any 3d movie. There was also a couple fairly decent pop-outs, which i could care less about because i only really prefer good depth in 3d movies. As for the aspect change to 1:78 1, i enjoy that aspect more with 3d movies, but only if the film was shot in that aspect. This movie was not shot in 1:78 1 and the original aspect of 2:39:1 was definitely cut a little off on the sides and given more on the top and bottom. I think it was well done, but i do prefer the original aspect. Other than the aspect, i have no complaints about this movies 3d whatsoever.

A superb movie with robots,"In a futuristic world where autonomous robots lived among humans according to three fundamental laws which made them unable to hurt any living soul, an unusual detective must investigate a case which might be related to the infringement of those laws. Seeming to be the perfect man for the job, due to his ""hate"" for anything robotic, he's going to uncover a mystery much deeper than anyone would have thought, which may put even the existence of humans into peril.It's a movie which bases its story in an unique world full of robots, which are seemingly faultless in their job of helping an protecting their owners, and introduces a deep mystery with many implications and severe consequences. The detective must act fast, against all odds and especially against his department, to solve the case before it's too late for everyone. We follow his complex, well described and presented character throughout many events, filled with action, drama, emotion and suspense until the case reaches its final steps. The plot is top notch, very well thought and put together, generating plenty of suspense and providing a very satisfying finale.The visuals are simply stunning, making you lust for more with every scene it depicts, the actors play their roles with style while the robots are very well portrayed, making the whole action very credible. It left me with a great feeling after each view (yes, I've seen it multiple times) and it doesn't get any less entertaining. It's simply a great movie which you like it so much that no matter how many times you see it, it will make you feel like the first time and this aspect makes it one of the greats.

If Back To The Future And Terminator 3:  Rise Of The Machines Had A Child.,"This was the typical type of Will Smith movie you'd expect to see.

It wasn't exactly the type of movie you had to sit down and think about, but just relax and enjoy the action.Will Smith played pretty much the same character he does in all of his movies, but believe it or not, I can see improvement in his acting skills.Bridget Moynahan's character was very similar to Sandra Bullock's in Demolition Man.  She did an excellent job in her role.The beginning of the movie reminded me of the Back To The Future trilogy with the cool little gadgets, cars and of course, robots.  It had a fun feel to it with seeing into the future and all, just without the time travel.The action sequences and most of the plot remind me of either Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines or Independence Day.  This being because of the overwhelming amount of robots or machines similar to the machines in T3 or the aliens in Independence Day.The ending scene, without giving anything away, totally had me thinking of Planet Of The Apes.

Will Smith to the rescue,"The robots are a revelation--insect-like, fast-moving and believable. But the Will Smith role is strictly from comicsville. It's not that Smith is all that bad an actor. He plays the usual Will Smith part--kind of a cross between Eddie Murphy and Audie Murphy. His part is written as if Smith had the script in his back pocket while everyone else walks blindly around robot town.All this flick needed was a little mystery--just a little but that ain't the way it goes. Oh, Smith rumbles around with a young lady looking for clues but it's weak.The one thing you know--you can bank on--the message is the same from Frankenstein to 2001 to Westworld to Jurassic Park to I, Robot--technology as grand as it may be will always turn on us humans.Since we know that, what's this story about, you ask? Won't tell you.Just know that there are good special effects and little to no suspense. At some point, Hollywood may want to really consider if all the effects aren't harming movies in the long run. You can make all these amazing things crash and burn and it's all very believable. Trouble is--it's covering up a weak story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

I don't get the hate (and I read),"I grew-up reading Asimov. The ""Foundation"" series was great fun.

In this case the producers acknowledged it was ""based on an/the idea."" I've said it elsewhere, but comparing a book to a film is like comparing a painting to a poem. Set reasonable expectations and enjoy things for what they are. Check out the ""original"" Anthony Burgess novel ""A Clockwork Orange"" against the Kubrick film. Burgess acknowledged he was a ""starving artist"" offered a TRUCKLOAD of money to let Kubrick do the film. The original novel and the Kubrick treatment are COMPLETELY different.

Another moviegoer next to me said that this was a really good movie, and I think so, too. Will Smith's character in the movie might have rubbed some critics the other way, but judging from the reactions of the audience, it really enjoyed cop Spooner's reactions and comments, aside from the action sequences, of course. Needless to say, the special effects (especially the translucent skin of the robots) and the action sequences impressed me as well.

But it is definitely made with a feeling for the publics possible need for some deeper emotion and some deeper thoughts. Often it is also beautiful, even poetic. And often it's a good thriller and you feel your heart pounding.The only big problem is the product placement of the shoes of the main character Detective Spooner played by Will Smith. It stinks all the way from the US to Europe. Believe me.Otherwise it is a surprisingly tight and well played drama in entertainment style.

"Domo Arigato, Mr. Roboto","After thinking about this movie I have started to realize how they have taken a series of short stories written by one of the greatest all time science fiction writers and butchered some aspects of it. While there are many fascinating aspects of man's relationship with technology I can't help but think that this movie was only part inspiration and science fiction and more another in a long line of big budget Hollywood pictures that are filled with so many clichés and needless other film aspects that are not necessary to make this a good film, in fact these clichés and theatrical add-ons do nothing but hinder the film, and make what could have been an excellent film into a very silly film. Asimov would be very disappointed in what his series of short stories have become.The first problem with this film: Will Smith. Will Smith can be a very funny and entertaining comedic actor. But he has yet to seriously make the transition from comedic actor to actor that can be in a serious role such as this. Despite that I will admit there could have been a number of actors that could have been a lot worse in this part. The problem is I think that every lead part here requires a lot of depth and great acting, for this to be a truly excellent science fiction film, but Smith really was not able to provide the level of depth needed. Another problem with this movie is Bridget Moynahan. I admit she is cute but to ask her to be a real actress is like asking Mickey Mouse not to be a cartoon. She is not an actress, she is a nice firm body, with a lot of attributes, and in a movie that claims to be so serious and filled with philosophical questions about the fate of humanity she does not need to be in this film, she should be modeling, or in a movie that is not supposedly as thought provoking. The perfect movie for Bridget Moynahan's bad acting and obvious physical attribute would be anything with Freddie Prinze Jr. or Sarah Michelle Gellar, movie that are about as entertaining as watching grass grow, and yes Bridget Moynahan's acting is not quite as bad as watching grass grow, it is more like watching grass dying.But there are some positive aspects to this film, the first is you get a very eerie feeling watching in the middle of this movie, when you are not watching the bad acting, about the fate of humanity. This is a society that is hell bent on robots. Robots are everywhere in the future. They encompass every aspect of our lives, from our personal lives to our business lives. They are an integral part of everyday society in a way that in present day few can comprehend. When the movie talks about how robots are so integrated in society it really made me think, as well as a few people I was seeing this movie with. I told my friend in the theater 'this is freaky!' In this film they talked about computers shutting down libraries, about environmental degredation affecting society, and other global issues that affect us. The movie has a distinct tone of Asimov's time, as there is an implied trust in society that obviously does not exist in modern day America, as everyone does not think these robots pose any danger to anyone, and Will Smith's character is one of the outcasts, as he does not trust robots at all.. And it was, when this movie was a true science fiction film talking about technology and how it affects society this to me was Asimov's true vision of his work, not some silly Hollywood crap full of chiches and stupidity.But there are some bright spots in the cast. Bruce Greenwood plays Lawrence Robertson, the head of US Robot, the corporation that produces these robots.Chi McBride is excellent as John Burgin, Will Smiths boss who in understanding but always comprehensive of Will Smith's fear of robots. James Cromwell is also excellent as Dr. Alfred Lanning, the creator of these robots who is recently deceased, under mysterious circumstances, which is the centerpiece of the plot. Although this is a very fascinating film in many respects was unhappy with the finale. The finale was a typical slam-bang action thriller that might as well have been an alternative ending to The Matrix. This I think was nothing short of an insult to great science fiction, and aside from the bad acting is an insult to great science fiction work that is true science fiction instead of an excuse for an action film.To further add to the concept of a different time I get the feeling that Del Spooner, Will Smith's character is a comparison to McCarthyism, a reference to an earlier time as I mentioned before. In McCarthyism America was supposed to be scared of an enemy, and those that were not scared of this enemy were branded evil and part of the problem, which was in those days communism. Here paranoia is considered evil, and if you are paranoid of robots then you are branded an outcast in a McCarthy-like manner. This was one of the most fascinating aspects of the film, and one of the high-points of this film's writing style. The bottom line of this movie is that a good substantive film on the fate of man was sandwiched by a film full of Hollywood clichés. What could have been one of the best science fiction films of a generation has turned out to be a film with as many equally bad points as there are good points. This film is also entirely too reliant on computer effects. When I watch films like this, which are heavily computerized I am turned off by them, I do not feel as though I am watching anything, just something someone created from a computer. And I feel like if most of this movie, or at least large parts of it were created by computers I could create full length films on my computer. I know I can't, but perhaps the creation of films through computer is yet another question all of humanity will eventually will have to answer to",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
My Father made me with purpose,"Hidden inside of an action movie are some really good questions:1) What makes us human? 2) How much should we rely on or trust technology? 3) Are we made for a purpose?Of course there is great action and a murder mystery to boot. The story is creative and fun to follow. Will Smith does his Will Smith thing with a little chip on his shoulder, but it works for this role. All the acting works but is not particularly memorable, which really attests to the excellence of the story.Besides the ho-hum acting, a few things keep this from being a great movie. With technology being advanced as it was portrayed for the setting couldn't all of Spooner's claims have been checked (robot pulling gun on him, demolition bot attacking him, highway attack, etc...) surely someone could have said, ""video from highway"" and seen the proof. And if it was all erased by Viki that would be suspicious enough to side with Spooner.Of course there are the impossible action sequences, but that is forgivable because it is an action movie not poetry hour at the coffee shop.All in all a fun film to watch with more value than demerits.

Fun and action-packed but it's also engaging and smart.,"Although released during the summer and being sold under a headline of CGI, stunts and action when it came out  I still didn't get that guilty pleasure; relaxed feeling you're perhaps supposed to get when watching a blockbuster and this is one of a few things that make I, Robot a thoroughly enjoyable film.I've read in some places that this film is perhaps a 'poor man's Blade Runner' but let me tell you something: as much as I thought Blade Runner was a pretty average film that relies on its crossing of genres to help it withstand the test of time, you have to admit to the similarities although in my opinion; I, Robot is just a little bit better. I think I, Robot has a touch of the 'noir' tone. The protagonist of the film is a detective, he's smart and fast talking; brushing people off with one-liners as he goes about his business. He has also suffered in the past  a tragedy we catch glimpses of in his horrible dreams and one that is unravelled in a pleasing way. I, Robot also manages to tie in this noir tone with other conventions that just make a film 'fun'.I liked the way we learn more and more about our hero Del Spooner (Smith) as he either reveals it to other characters or they state it as a matter of fact. We first discover he's an officer of the law after he chases down a robot whom appears to have snatched a handbag but we also discover things about the world in which the film is set (Chicago 2035) as adverts amongst other things tell us the role and importance of robots in this world.Early on, the character of Spooner is also depicted as one whom no one believes. He has a grudge against the robots but we do not know the motivation behind this grudge at the time. Due to this feeling, everyone doubts Spooner's ability to judge as well as his own sanity and because we do not know the facts; the audience themselves are put in a position that makes them doubt whether this hero is up to the task.As I, Robot unravels; we get deeper and deeper into a supposed murder investigation whilst at the same time clues are being solved and the truth is becoming clearer. This then spawns one or two interesting chase scenes or action set pieces including one set on a highway and involving multiple aggressive robots and a sequence in which Spooner is, quite literally: the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. The film also dabs in and out of a second story taking place revolving around a robot character called Sonny (who thinks and acts so much like a human being he could be counted as one) and his apparent guilty imprisonment under watchful eye of acting parole officer/doctor/lab technician Susan Calvin. Whilst all this takes place, I got a genuine feeling that the film was building to something.I, Robot is a better and smarter film than you would think. Although it seems to favour its product placement of 'JVC' and 'Audi' whilst, literally, blocking out that of 'Fed-Ex', the film doesn't have that many flaws or things that stick out and irritate you. The final sequence reminded me of a cross between Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines but also Resident Evil with a pinch of The Matrix, stunt-wise but this doesn't detract too much as everything preceding this has done its job to entertain us and make us care thus making I, Robot a very enjoyable sci-fi, detective film that turns a little dark half way through but maintains an enjoyable, action packed atmosphere until the end.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Amateur Robotics?,"Entertaining big-budget sci-fi, light on philosophy, heavy on SFX and none the worse for that. Adapting Asimov's famous book and then putting Will Smith right in the middle of it, well, what would you expect...? Making wisecracks a-plenty as if he's only just moved out of Bel-Air, you just know this is going to pay as much attention to its source material as latter day Bond features to Fleming's original novels, but putting that admittedly major caveat aside this is good quality latter day Hollywood blockbuster film-making which ticks all the buttons you'd expect it to. Smith is likable in his ""Men In Black"" / ""Independence Day"" reprise and enters fully into his blue-screen persona. The story is reasonably intelligent and told at a furious pace, stopping only occasionally for some mild debate on the whole free-will issue before careering on into the next action set-piece. The computer graphic enhanced sets of Futureworld are impressive as are the depictions of the army of robots which rise up against their makers and the interaction of the humans comes off well most of the time, although some shots (for example Smith on his motorbike) are less successfully realised. The dialogue is okay, automatic at times, and perhaps lacking in snappy one-liners to take your mind off the story's adapting to film mores of the new Millennium. All in all a movie to sit with a big box of popcorn alongside,(if you can look past the fairly blatant product placement - and no, my next car will not be an Audi!), glory in the big car chase and the various fight sequences - in fact in that sense maybe's it's not so far removed from those blissfully innocent 50's sci-fi entertainments like ""The Day The World Stood Still"" or the original ""War of The Worlds"". In that sense ""I Robot"" is perhaps a minor achievement after all.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

The use of red lights to indicate evil robots and blue for good belied the simplicity of any philosophy in the film.

not robotic at all,"Obviously, ""I, Robot"" is the sort of movie that could very easily end up being completely ridiculous: an action star in a futuristic movie about humans battling robots. That certainly sounds like it could degenerate into an even lamer version of ""Independence Day"" - and I'm not just saying that because it stars Will Smith.However, the movie does manage to do something good. For starters, it's not just an excuse for a bunch of action (although there is a lot). To me at least, the movie seems to be looking at the possible dangers of people relying too much on technology, like what ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" looked at. As cop Del Spooner, investigating a murder in 2035 Chicago that may or may not have been committed by a robot, Will Smith is sardonic, but never formulaic. Also starring James Cromwell. On one level, maybe the movie is sort of eye candy. But like I said, there is a plot here.

As long as they stole the title of the book, maybe there is an obligation to use some semblance of the laws of robotics. This is like most of the science fiction coming out these days. It's some guy trying to buck the establishment (the new Enron or whatever), who has to get to the bottom of things. He gets beaten up and barely escapes with his life several times along the way. Why couldn't someone with a lick of cleverness, build in a kind of means of circumventing or explaining the behavior based on the laws that Asimov set up. It doesn't mean that he or she would have had to copy the plots; just play by the rules. But then you would have to have the wherewithall to use a brain and come up with a plot that would fit.

Utter garbage,"in one sentence: it ain't Asimov, it ain't entertainment. The original story cycle was intelligent and thought-provoking, this movie is neither.

It is not Asimov's plot, and I take using the name of a classic fiction write as gross disrespect - of author and an insult to viewers' intelligence (assuming there's any). It truly takes talent, chutzpa and insolence to screw up a classic: many thanks to producers for p***ing on Asimov's grave - this movie was almost as bad as Around the World in 80 days, only more so, as nobody reads Verne anymore, anyways.

It ain't Asimov,"I am going to skip any plot specifics.  They don't matter.  This movie has almost nothing to do with anything Isaac Asimov wrote.  It nods in the direction of Asimov's famed three laws of robotics.  I won't go into those because I'm sure they've been included in numerous other comments.  Some of Asimov's characters are present in name.  The laws and the characters are all that survive of his work in this film.When I first saw that a film called I, Robot based on Asimov was in production, I was almost giddy with excitement.  I thought somebody had managed to get Harlan Ellison's script of it filmed.  No such luck.  I saw that it was going to be a kind of murder mystery, and I thought maybe they had adapted one of the Elijah Bayley/R. Daneel Olivaw novels.  I have seen the movie, and they did not.Although the three laws are present in the film, they are ultimately discarded in their implications.  In Asimov's works, any violation of the laws leads to a complete shut-down of the robot's positronic brain or at least the robotic equivalent of catatonia.  The greatness in Asimov's work is how he weaves his plots around the practical application of the laws in unpredictable human situations.  Asimov started writing the robot stories because he wanted to get away from what he called the `Frankenstein Syndrome' direction most such stories took at the time.  That is, thinking machines turn on their masters.  The first story he wrote on the subject involved a robot nanny that ends up saving a child's life after incessant paranoia has been rained on it by the child's mother.  The whole point of Asimov's laws is that they are inviolable.  The twist in his stories was that the machines always behaved exactly as they were supposed to, and the problems arose out of humans failing to appreciate subtleties inherent in how the laws work in real situations.  Any robot harming (even by accident) or allowing a human to be harmed through inaction would cease to function. End of story.  When this becomes inconvenient, one cannot ignore this for the sake of the plot one wants to have if one is going to be true to Asimov. The only reason I can think of for having Asimov's name on the credits is to draw in people who are fans of his work.  That is also the only reason to keep the title of Asimov's book on this movie, because it has absolutely nothing to do with that collection of short stories entitled I, Robot.  The Ellison script I mentioned earlier would have been vastly better.So in short, if the attraction of this movie for you is Will Smith and the action movie genre, you'll probably be OK. If you're going to this movie because you're an Asimov fan, don't.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Been there done that,"First off, I give this movie a zero for originality. Robots taking over is so Odyssey 2001, Terminator, Matrix, etc. Even the setting and technology of Chicago 2035 was reminiscent of Minority Report, Judge Dredd, A.I., et al. Their only hope to bail this movie out from a total mimic was to add some brain teaser twist to it. For that I will complement them. The main character, Det. Spooner (Will Smith) had to follow the clues given to him by the late Dr. Lanning (James Cromwell) to find out the whens, wheres, whys, whos, whats, and hows to the A.I. invasion. Following the clues along with the detective did add some intrigue to the movie.The CGI was good, though the special effects were overdone. There were a couple of scenes that seemed as though they belonged in the Matrix. Overall I would like to give it a 5.5, but I rounded up.

"I, Slow Motion Will Smith","A classic story, one of my favorites, here come the robots, oh, but they're not what they seem.  Isaac Asimov nailed one of the greatest plots around. I have no beefs with the plot. Will Smith, however, goes into slow motion whenever he does anything. Jumping off a motorcycle, slow motion, shooting some robots, slow motion, walking down his stairs, you get the picture.  Several scenes in this movie would have been better off in real-time. Bridget Moynahan did a better job than I expected from a model, she has certainly graduated in her abilities since the, ahem, challenging role of a hot bartender in Coyote Ugly. Del Spooner (Will Smith) is an alright character, but don't get him confused with Jim West, Agent J, and Capt. Steve' Hiller (Independence Day).  Will Smith has shown that he can act, in movies like The Legend Of Baggar Vance, and Ali, but too often he seems to fall back on being ""The Black Hero Guy""stuck in a bad situation; i.e. Enemy Of The State. The Robots fights were sweet, no two ways about it, and all of the loose ends can be accounted for, with no noticeable plot holes.  The thing that made me drop my jaw in disappointment was the ridiculous cinematics during the final battle scene; for no apparent reason, several times, the camera swung around Will Smith two or three times really really fast.  Now, CGI-assisted camera effects can be sweet, like, for example, in Bad Boys 2 when the camera swings around Will Smith while he's shooting bad guys through the doors, or in What Lies Beneath when the camera when beneath the floor and looked up at Michelle Pfeiffer's body.   When utilized correctly these effects can add a lot to a film, but the camera spun around Smith several times then when back to where it started from... you couldn't even tell what was happening while it was spinning, it didn't add anything to the film, if fact it took away a few seconds of cool action and replaced it with an expensive CGI blur. But stupid cinematics aside, great movie, plots twists out your ear, and unexpectedly gripping action sequences.

Doesn't reach its potential,"As a big fan of Isaac Asimov, I can say that I have enjoyed most films based on his work, but I don't think any of them have reached the same tone that permeate his various short stories and novels. More often than not they take the basic ideas and the settings and then proceed to play out as big Hollywood blockbusters. The same in this case. The Three Laws of Robotics are an important part of Asimov's writings, and they do get their limelight here, but the way they are explained, handled and addressed is rather disappointing, because Asimov has dedicated whole novel series to these three laws and their various strengths and weaknesses. And while some of these strengths and weaknesses do get addressed in this film, it still feels like they only scratched the surface, if even that. Much more time is spent following around Will Smith's character, Spooner, and admiring his hijinks and vintage Doc Martinis.And don't get me wrong, I like Will Smith's role here. He plays a very convincing tough cop with a troubled past and you can totally understand his dislike for robots, especially when more light is shed on the events of the past. But I still think that the movie would have been better had more time been spent with the principles and underlying theories of robotics rather than Spooner and his wacky grandmother. I can understand the decision to go with more Spooner and less robo-theory, because it's a more marketable choice, especially with Will Smith in the lead role, but it still lacks ambition and effort.Especially so when Will Smith plays pretty much the only good character in the film. The rest are played by actors of varying quality, but they all seem rather flat and unimaginative, with the possible exception of the robopsychologist Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan). She didn't do much for me, but at least she had some characteristics. The same can't be really said about the various robot characters, because while they tried to insert some degree of humanity into them, they also tried to make them a bit alien-like, detached from the world, which also served the purpose of detaching them from the audience.Then again, I must admit that the various robots look remarkably good, especially for their time, and the special effects in general are very nice to look at. The same can be said about the action scenes, which are a lot of fun, being imaginative and intense.In the end, it all boils down to the story, which isn't all that hot, as I've said. It's not bad for a typical blockbusters, if anything it's slightly above average. It's just that there was so much potential for more. They could have gone with a more thoughtful, psychological route, especially with someone like Will Smith leading - he has the depth for it. Instead we get a pretty basic scifi action film. It's very good for what it is, and if you're looking for nothing more, it'll suit your purposes perfectly, but I'll always see what it failed to do, which sours my personal viewing experience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Wow! No shortage of opinions for this film,"I just saw this film on DVD last night, and decided to check out the reviews this morning. It seems that ""I, Robot"" has polarized the critical viewing community here on IMDb (and given rise to a lot of insults and name-calling, too).I find this somewhat surprising, as this film is not great (or even good), but neither is it terrible (or even really bad). What this film really is, is...depressing. Depressing that the US film-goer population is so ready to lap up insipid, clichéd re-heats, and acclaim them as spectacular new works. This film as ""retread"" written all over it, from the plot line (an uneasy mix of Asimov and modern-day uber-action) to Smith's character (a smart-mouthed cynic with a backbone of titanium), to the special effects (that borrowed from Matrix and a few others).""I, Robot"" is, sadly, quite possibly the perfect action movie for today's audience: superficial plot, insipidly snappy dialog, and lots and lots of adrenaline. Smith is mediocre, but we already knew that (he seems to be Hollywood's latest unsuccessful attempt to create a black Bruce Willis). The story has lots of holes in it, of all sizes, but I don't think most people drawn to this film are critically-minded enough to notice. Perhaps a blockbuster by today's standards, but very B-movie compared to true winners.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"I, love this","`I,Robot' is the reason people make movies. To create lives and things that probably never really will exist. Who can tell if this will ever happen? Let's hope not, but wouldn't it be great if we could create something to help us, even to be our friend? Who says robot's will never control the world? OK, I know, this is just a movie, but I love they way people play with the future. To create your own world, your own things, cause oh my god, these robot rule! Who created them? Their faces are so not-robot, while the rest of the body is. They made the robot friendly and kind and they made me believe I could even really love a robot like that. With those cute eyes and nice lips. Why couldn't that red light be a heart, the only thing that made you believe those robot's feel. Though, it made them a little scary, like a red traffic light warns you to stop.The movie was great, the actors amazing and the special effects even a little real.

"I, Liked It","I found it easy to overlook the flaws in I, Robot.  Of course, there's no Consumer Reports in the future to evaluate the quality and reliability of robots, and there doesn't seem to any problem with the apparent monopoly US Robotics has on their production.  There doesn't seem to be any government oversight at all, as if the movie tells its story in a vacuum.  And what about a robot designed to perform menial tasks yet has the power to leap 30 feet effortlessly?  Who would design a slave with that capability?  So, I ignore these weaknesses and think about the mystery, the ""bread crumbs."" The story is interesting and the dialogue is smart and funny.

Not brilliant but above average.,"""I, robot"" doesn't resemble any of Asimov stories as far I can tell. Sure, it has been a long time since I read the actual book, but I have the hunch only thing common with the movie and the book is the name Del Spooner (Will Smith) and the laws of robotics. Other than that there's no real reason to start comparing the movie on Asimov's writings. There actually is a phrase in the ending of the film ""As suggested by the stories of Asimov"". I think that rests the case in that department.So Spooner is this paranoid cop, who hates robots. He's bit racist that way, and that's not even a subtle hint. It's just stuffed on your face from the beginning. In fact there's very little anything subtle in the film, it's action from the beginning with tad too much slo-mo scenes in it. Robots of course have never done anything wrong, but it's first time for everything. Spooner starts to suspect, that a robot has killed a man in the robot factory. But no-one believes him, as there are clearly written laws (in robots programming of course) denying robots to harm humans. So let the games begin.Biggest problem actually comes from the CGI, which is okay, but in several places is just looks too fake to actually fit in the image of photo-real. This is terribly visible in the last scene of the film, which looks a tad unfinished. Maybe they were rushed, who knows. Also the scenes with massive amounts of robots and humans look fake. There are, how ever, couple of rather nice camera movements thanks to the CGI.Acting is action movie standards. Onliners split the air during action and it's mostly entertaining, thought some scenes lack the edge and the energy.I feel, that with little more effort ""I, robot"" could have been much better film than it's now. Now it hangs somewhere above average.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Work of Art,"I, Robot is one of the most luxurious sci-fi films I have ever seen. The sets have been perfectly created, matching both futuristic buildings as well as older buildings with brick walls. The plot is brilliant, and it heavily focuses on Issac Aismov's theory.However, Aismov's ideas did not include the robots going crazy, but that they coexisted with humans perfectly. The film even goes into some detail about Aismov's zeroth law, if it does not specifically call it that. I'll let you find out what this law is for yourself, don't want to ruin it for you. Another lacking quality would be the characters. Smith's role is somewhat boisterous and this seems to be another movie in which Smith is a macho guy who saves the world, using many of his traditional phrases, EGA ""Aw hell no!"".Despite these facts, the movie is a success. The robot Sonny steals the scene every time he is shown and the amazing detail which has gone into these humanoids is amazing. Careful time and effort has been put into this movie, and the surprises are plentiful. Based upon Aismov's theories, I think the movie has done him justice and after his actions to make I, Robot a film in a previous decade, he should be pleased with what has been created.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

I have some nice shoes to show you,"I Robot isn't that bad flick, it does some things pretty well but unfortunately along with the good bits the makers of this film decided to deliver a huge kick in the teeth to its audience. Yes I'm talking about he Converse product placement, it is so obtrusive it's almost like it's intended to satirise the Hollywood practice of sprinkling brand names throughout film productions. We get a big dollop of Audi too but that's handled a little more conventionally.It's a Will Smith vehicle because he was a huge draw back when this flic was made and as a consequence there's no much room for anyone else in the picture except for -- wait for it, Shia LaBeouf. Yes unfortunately as well as the aggressive product placement, this film suffers from, -is there a part for Shia LaBeouf- syndrome. Thankfully Shia's involvement is brief but let's take a moment to congratulate his agent because that man/woman really does deserve the, Best Representation for a Marginal Actor Oscar.Anyway back to the flick, Will does his thing showing off his pecks, abs etcetera, as well as giving the gays in the audience a scene of him showering naked early on. While I don't begrudge our fruitier brethren their eye candy, it's not really my thing and the sight of Wills huge hairy arse, even if it is tastefully silhouetted, is fairly disturbing. As the narrative progresses we see Will dominating every scene, he's always got some dazzling repartee, quip or eccentricity to exercise for the benefit of his fans and while this might work for those who adore him, it doesn't make for effective drama. We do see him on at a disadvantage in two scenes but they are literally solo efforts with no other characters present.The cgi is pretty good, there's quite a nice swarm of robots slithering towards our heroes as they reach the climax that's quite effective and Alan Tudyk (that's really his name and shouldn't it be pluralised?) gives the robot a certain amount of character. As I mentioned It's not really a bad flick but to really appreciate it, you need to be a Smith fan.One major point of contention I'd like to raise is the script's attempt at exploring the issues raised by synthetic brains and robotics, ie that of consciousness and freewill. This is attempted mostly through James Cromwell's character, who from beyond the grave delivers an oration that mentions 'random segments of code' and 'unexpected protocols'. Uh, where did they get that twaddle from, the scriptwriter crib it from Windows NT blue screen. Honestly it's so asinine it's beyond belief, yet they actually reiterate almost the entire speech later in the film, as if it was something to be proud of. Come on people, if you're gonna flirt with such questions at least think about it for five minutes so you don't come across as complete idiot.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Poor judgment and lack of vision,"I watched this 'adaptation' of Isaac Asimov book and found it to be the worst case of 'artist freedom' that ever existed  more like 'Artist Decapitation'. This movie destroys 50 years of Asimov work and is a disgrace to the film industry. 20th century thinks it can only make a buck by special effects  if that what it wants do use some cheap piece of writing. I, Robot (the book) may not be action pack but it has the possibility of a great movie (some day  by someone who as true vision of artist freedom and expression). I, Robot could have been made exploring the characters and settings of the book. People went to see the Truman Show, Bicentennial Man, Saving Private Ryan, Notting Hill as well as movies like The Lord of the Rings, Stars Wars. I, Robot is similar in some ways to all the movies mention above (Although some in very small ways)  My point is if a real writer and director had handled this movie it could have combined great special effects with great stories, characters and actors. It would have been a challenge but to me it would have shown great creativity and skill  Not some 5cent rip off of a man with great vision who inspired thousands of people  including some who created real robots and went into the field of science because of his dreams and ideas of the future. If this is how Hollywood treats a great idea I truly feel sorry for future moviegoers.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Sci-fi intellectuality vs. the Hollywood action movie machine,"It's a good thing robots haven't taken over the world, but it's a shame Hollywood is run by them. When a director with a gift for science-fiction like Alex Proyas (""Dark City"") is asked to helm a big-name big-budget action flick starring an A-lister in Will Smith, a battle has already begun: the human artist or the Hollywood machine? ""I, Robot"" is a slick and exciting futuristic action movie, but it gives the highly evident man vs. machine themes too light of a treatment considering the age of special effects in cinema has delivered movies with similar insights before.Smith gets a little closer to freeing himself from the Hollywood bondage that has stuck him with mediocre sequels to the ""Men in Black"" and ""Bad Boys"" films. The only alarming factor is that this marks the first time Smith has invested in himself as executive producer and leading man. Considering the way the script pimps Smith out to his fans with dumb, smart- ass one-liners, one hopes Smith backed the film on its thematic potential and the chance for him to play a character with a slightly more sophisticated background.Smith stars as Det. Del Spooner, a homicide cop in Chicago in the year 2035, where robots are as commonplace as the cell phones of today, robots programmed to obey three laws that essentially state saving human life is paramount to all other instructions. When the father of this technology (James Cromwell) dies by apparent suicide, Spooner -- who for personal reasons doesn't trust robots -- investigates what looks to be more than meets the eye (pardon me, Transformers).Inspired by the book by famed science-fiction author Isaac Asimov and written by Jeff Vintar (""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"") and ""American Beauty"" Oscar winner Akiva Goldsman, ""I, Robot"" wastes no time questioning if intelligent artificial life forms guided by logic and reason can replace the need for human emotions to guide free will. It's a bit blunt at times, but something to chew on that's more than popcorn at a summer blockbuster is certainly welcome.Proyas brings the future to life by means comparable to Steven Spielberg's vision in ""Minority Report,"" a futuristic murder story two years this film's senior. Other than some really annoying product placement (a FedEx delivery robot, Audi and Smith wears Converse All- Stars) bogging it down, this is a vision of the future that not only appeals to the eye, but definitely appears to have been given a great deal of thought. It's not gratuitous technology for coolness' sake, it all serves a practical purpose other than the bells and whistles of the robots.But the script would prefer to keep Smith talking smack and providing too much of our background information than giving him some serious depth. Spooner is not a carbon copy of any previous Smith character, but it's still pretty clear in the writing and the Converse All- Stars that Smith is there to score style points above all else. And with the rest of the cast being throwaways or too small of roles to count, this is once again his show. Better, but still his show.""I, Robot"" sits on the cusp of a great science-fiction film; after all, its director has made one before. But it prefers to operate on the surface level as if it were worried going deeper would ruin its commercial appeal. In the end, its another example of a movie that could have been made better but got manufactured by the Hollywood machine, duping us with eye candy into believing we want a safe, formulaic sci-fi movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

What came of this collaboration is an entirely watchable (if entirely dismissable) summer popcorn movie.Will Smith is enjoyable, if a little darker than normal in his role.

Minimalism,"The movie I robot is the Isaac Asimov's book of the same name. The movie is about a policeman against advance technology, where people depend more and more on thecnology and less on themselves. In a near future where robots become a part of daily life in the cities to make easier the process. There are three laws that govern the robots: Law I: A robot may not harm a human or, by inaction, allow a human being to come to harm Law II: A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law Law III: A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second lawThis laws may seem contradictory so they can preserve at all costs humanity. But when humanity doesn't want protection, what happens? If I order a robot to kill someone that may or may not harm, they must obey. But according to their laws they can't, because they are not killing machines. So the mere purpose of robots is to reduce to statistics and calculations so they can act, even against their owner. So their rules become null when there is a higher purpose at hand, they act on duty but we don't. https://pensarparaserfeliz.wordpress.com/2017/04/09/i-robot-and- minimalism/",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

During other films I am always looking for what the twist might be and seeing at the end if I was right. In I, Robot I didn't have time to stop and think about it, I was far too engrossed by the story and action to care!Will Smith is the coolest man on the planet! He should stay away from biopics like Ali and stick to what he is better than anyone else at, being cool.The special effects were a bit dodgy at times but mostly were superb, delivering a very beautiful (and almost believable) view of the future. The action sequences were directed perfectly (except maybe when there was a little too much camera swoooshing).The real appeal of I, Robot however was the story. I have not read Isaac Asimov's original short story and therefore I don't care how close to it the movie was. I enjoyed it because it was very intelligent and actually quite original which is rare these days.Maybe on second viewing my opinion will change and maybe the impact won't be as great on DVD but for now I am happy that I have seen the best action movie this summer so far.9/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"I, Entertained.","Movies have been warning us for quite some time now: artificial intelligence will only result in the downfall of mankind, with humans either enslaved by machines or wiped out completely. In this near-future blockbuster sci-fi, technophobic cop Del Spooner (Will Smith) is convinced that the robot rebellion is underway after Dr. Alfred Lanning, creator of the advanced NS-5 robot, takes a high dive out of his office window. The death is labelled as a suicide by Lanning's boss, but Spooner calls foul-play, suspecting Sonny, an NS-5 unit who is found in the scientist's locked lab, and who flees the scene when confronted. As Spooner investigates further, and gets closer to uncovering the truth, he finds himself repeatedly under attack from malevolent machines.Directed by Alex Proyas (Dark City, The Crow), I, Robot is a rollicking ride with a solid turn by its charismatic star and cutting edge CGI effects (at the time), all wrapped up in an engaging story. Proyas' vision of 2035 might seem a little far-fetched, there's a little too much product placement (albeit very cool looking futuristic product placement) and at least two scenes stretch plausibility beyond breaking point (Spooner's car attacked by robots in a tunnel and the OTT finale), but I couldn't help but have fun with this one, finding the whole idea of errant AI machines fascinating—a glimpse of what the future might hold in store for us all if we're not careful.7.5 out of 10, which I'll generously round up to 8 even despite the presence of Shia LaBeouf.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
I Robot,"After re watching this for the first time in many of years, i came to realise how corny Will smith's character "" Spooner "" is ( yes, i was relevantly young during first viewing). At times i cringed at some of the lines he came out with. It not Smith himself, but the dialogue. However, with it fabulous CGI and decent story which is cemented within the three laws, I Robot is another good Hollywood blockbuster.The story never dives in deep with the three laws, there just used to give focus to the story of Sonny, a robot which is "" Unique"". Spooner, a detective, is possibly the only human being on Earth he despises these robots and when he believes that One of them is responsible for the death of the Creator, everyone around is certain that he has lost the plot. This being the fundamental of the plot, it fairly obvious where the main protagonist will take us.The CGI is spectacular and worth the initial viewing.

"I, Fresh Prince","I, Robot finds Will Smith in unfamiliar territory - a movie with a hint of intelligence. Based very loosely on Isaac Asimov's robot stories, using the ""3 Laws"" as a launching point, the picture is set just 35 years after the Willenium, in 2035 Chicago.Apparently, I, Robot feels you did not see enough advertising before the start of the movie, as straight away, you'll be inundated with ads for a sneaker company, a parcel delivery service, and by the time you leave the theater, you'll have a strange notion that you really need an Audi. Audi is good... Audi is your friend... Audi will not harm you...You'll also notice a couple things right off the bat about the future. One is that transportation and robot technology will make incredible leaps and bounds over the next 31 years, to the point where Chicago has a whole underground autobahn for maglev-type vehicles. Wow, who ironed out that bureaucracy? My local government is going to take over a decade to build a 15-mile beltway that's above ground, made out of plain old concrete, and will only accommodate regular gas-powered cars. The underground roadway of I, Robot even comes with its own automated valet, which files your car away vertically in a specially made ""parking lot"". Pretty cool, and a small price to pay for having to learn to own a car without loose items inside. The other thing you'll notice is that people of the future are awfully trusting of robotic technology. They absolutely refuse to believe that robots can glitch. Then again, Microsoft's logo is nowhere to be found in the picture, so that might make some sense.This lack of technophobia is explained shortly, when Detective Spooner (Will Smith) meets Dr. Calvin (Bridget Moynahan) during an investigation of a fishy looking suicide involving robot engineering genius Dr. Lanning (James Cromwell) in his office at US Robotics, a company which has gone from making modems in the 20th century to robots in the 21st (What foresight!). Dr. Calvin's job is to make these creepy and potentially dangerous robots appear human and trustworthy, a lot like how a government neuters its constitution by cratering the 1st and 4th amendments and makes it all seem friendly and beneficial by calling it the ""Patriot Act"". Anyway, Dr. Calvin has a doubter on her hands with Det. Spooner. He hates robots. At first, it seems it's just because he's old fashioned. He owns a gas-powered motorbike, listens to Stevie Wonder tunes from 65 years ago, prefers to drive his maglev using the steering wheel, and still struts around in that gangsta-rapper swagger that went out of fashion way back in the year 2004. He's so old school, he even showers without a curtain. However, you will eventually learn he has another reason for hating robots during a plot contrivance midway through the film, shortly after another plot contrivance that reveals his bionic arm.Spooner suspects a model in the latest line of robots is behind the good doctor's death, but has no real evidence and is hampered by the unrelenting faith of the robot believers, even after a glitch in the building's security system, named NIKI (Shodan, from System Shock) blots out the critical moment from the surveillance tapes.This is where Spooner's investigation begins, and after a couple requisite cop-movie clichés (case obsession, booted from force), he uncovers a conspiracy involving a robot revolution, stemming from an over-translation of the 3 Robotic Laws.Somebody should have told Will Smith this wasn't Men in Black III, as his wisecracking persona that we've seen a hundred times already is really out of place here. And those 'hero leaps'? Where the hero hurtles himself through the air in slow-motion while pulling off some inhuman feat (usually involving firearms)? Yep, sadly, a couple of those are in there as well, making one suspect that John Woo has hijacked the production. We also get to see yet another example of 2004's favorite cinematic chestnut, the CGI army, topped off by a scene where hundreds of robots scale the side of a skyscraper. Aside from that, the CGI is actually very good. There's also a faint attempt in the story to determine what constitutes the line between artificial life and real life, but fortunately, the filmmakers realized this was ground trod plenty enough times by Star Trek alone and let it drop.On the plus side, I, Robot has plenty of action and unlike many of today's movies, has a keen sense of rhythm about it, and in spite of a few too many shopworn story devices, this movie still has a surprise or two and doesn't take 2 and a half hours to get it out. While it first appears to be an anti-technology film, this isn't so much the case as a warning for checks and balances in safety/prevention devices, no matter how simple and self-maintaining they may appear to be. It's not often a modern Hollywood film - a sci-fi actioner, no less - actually has something to say about our current state of affairs.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Its basic rule to deal with ideas is respected here because this movie makes think about the robots. I think the modern, bright and chromatic design and cast are excellent: the duo of Will, Mr Cool and Bridget, Miss Cold, works perfectly. Unfortunately, the story is a bit complicated and a lot of the social effects of robots are left over. Worse, the future world is too close to our daily lives and by comparison, the funny and eccentric vision of ""Back to the future Part II"" is more interesting.

Fantastic movie,"When I went to theater in 2004, I had very high expectation for this movie going to be good, and it did. Alex Proyas, before he did ""Knowing"", directs this high tech exhilarating thriller about the 3 Laws of Robotics.Ever since we have excellent action blockbusters of 2004 such as The Day After Tomorrow, The Bourne Supremacy, Collateral, Spider Man 2, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, etc. I, Robot is one of them.The film stars Will Smith, Bridget Moynahan, James Cromwell, Bruce Greenwood, Chi Mcbride, etc.It's the year 2035, and the community now has the help of robots. These robots have three laws integrated into their system. One, they cannot harm a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. Two, they must do whatever they're told by a human being as long as such orders don't conflict with law one. Three, they have to defend themselves as long as such defense doesn't conflict with laws one or two. One day, the writer of the three laws, Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell), apparently jumps out of the tenth-floor window of U.S. Robotics. The majority of the Chicago Police Department believe that he committed suicide, but Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith), who hates robots, thinks he was murdered, and the number one suspect is a Nestor Class-5 robot who calls himself Sonny. However, if it was Sonny, then that means he would've had to have broken the three laws. With the help of Dr. Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan), Spooner must now discover the truth before it's too late.The acting of Will Smith in this movie is flawless.But I do believe that Bruce Greenwood is in so many films like The Core, Star Trek and so on.The movie is outstanding, an awesome summer blockbuster.I, Robot gets 10 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"I, Robot manages to feed ethical discussions about people's relationship with technology and the limits of the power we should attribute to it in an exciting blockbuster","The Russian Isaac Asimov (1920-1992) collected awards and gained enormous prestige in his long career as a science fiction writer. Celebrated as one of the greatest masters of the genre, alongside other geniuses such as Arthur C. Clarke and Robert A. Heinlein, the author produced almost 500 works. Among several books and short stories, his greatest contribution is the Three Laws of Robotics, unshakable principles of safety in the use of robots, which he applied in most of his work: 1. A robot cannot injure a human being or, by default, allow harm to a human being / 2. A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would contravene the first law / 3. A robot must protect its own existence, provided that such protection does not conflict with the first and second laws.Working together, the three laws are brilliantly simple. The most interesting essays on its use are in the series of nine short stories that Asimov wrote during the 1940s for various science fiction magazines. Later, these tales were gathered in the book I, Robot (I, Robot), which now hits theaters, adapted merely in essence, without following the narrative line of the stories. Interestingly, the lack of fidelity to the original material turned I, Robot into a work as interesting as the original. If any of the short stories were made into a movie, it wouldnt have enough power to hold 120 minutes of projection. With the option of screenwriter Jeff Vintar (Final Fantasy), aided by Akiva Goldsman (A Beautiful Mind), for the unprecedented story - which largely uses the concepts, the universe and some characters from the book -, the film gains appeal and, of course, fun.The series of small psychological dramas, punctuated by brief bursts of adventure, takes on the guise of a modern fiction thriller, full of conspiracies, high doses of adventure, good humor and suspense. The film takes place in the future; more precisely in 2035. As one would expect, that is a modern world, with parking lots that accommodate cars automatically; police insulation tapes projected as holograms; and androids that do all sorts of errands for humans, from picking up trash to prosaic walks with their owner's dogs. In fact, the only old-fashioned elements in the film are the various clichés present in its detective plot: the hero is an undisciplined detective who is constantly reprimanded by his superior and who, at a given moment, is forced to turn over his badge., since no one believes in their theories and investigation methods.Played by Will Smith, Del Spooner hates robots, always looking at them with suspicion - which is a big problem, since they are everywhere. When one of the most important scientists in the U. S. Robotics, the leading android manufacturing company, is found dead after falling from a great height, the detective immediately becomes suspicious of the robot Sonny, who was working directly with the victim. However, his suspicions are rejected by all the other police officers, as they contravene the three laws of robotics, which specify that no android can harm a human being. But Spooner is determined to prove him right, and in the process ends up growing close to psychologist Susan Calvin, a U. S. employee. Robotics.The films script is developed within the strict parameters of the genre: (1) a suspicious detective, a bit marginal, who has hidden a sad story from his past, (2) a heroine who starts off tough and intransigent, but gradually gives in to the arguments of the detective. (3) false villain placed in the plot to mislead and - of course (4,5,6,7,8...) action, adventure, rush, shootings, broken windows and all the clichés that consecrated the style.Even so, the film manages to approach interesting themes, such as the very concept of 'life': can an intelligent being and aware of its own existence be considered 'alive'? By the way, when does a machine with 'artificial intelligence' become 'conscious'? Discussions like these, which could certainly seem absurd at the time that Asimov created the Three Laws of robotics (which proves his status as a visionary), today become increasingly relevant thanks to colossal technological advances - and the super production starring Smith deserves credits for bringing it up.In fact, the script written by Jeff Vintar surprises precisely by proposing a radicalization of the Three Laws, conceiving a frightening scenario that, without escaping from Asimovs logic, finds new ways of interpreting the rules imposed on robots (I can't say any more, otherwise to deliver important plot points). In addition, I, Robot has intelligent dialogues that establish the conflicts between Men and Machines in a philosophical, but also pragmatic, way. At one point, for example, Spooner asks Sonny: ""- Could a robot compose a symphony? Could it take a blank canvas and turn it into a work of art?"". And the answer is simple, but devastating in its logic: ""- Could you?"".I, Robot is technically impeccable: from the gigantic sets (mostly created on a computer, obviously) to the animation of the robots, the project impresses the viewer - and the sure direction by Alex Proyas (from the great City of Shadows) keeps the story fluid., especially in the action sequences. Bringing merchandising pieces inserted in a non-organic way in the film (Spooner even boasts about his All Star model 2004 sneakers, believe it or not), Eu, Robô undoes the audience's immersion in his plot whenever he forgets its narrative and he indulges in shameless commerce, which turns out to be one of his great sins. In any case, the remnants of the original work are enough for us to leave the cinema reasonably satisfied. But it wasnt this time that the Russian writer won a proper transposition to the big screen - unlike what happened with Philip K. Dick, Hollywood still owes Asimov its Blade Runner.The world imagined for 2035 is very reminiscent of Minority Report - The New Law. In fact, a good analogy would be to identify I, Robot as being a mixture of Minority Report (the power to control a new technology in the hands of unscrupulous people) with Blade Runner (the same figure of the detective), in a more accessible package for the great public and, above all, much more fun. The special effects, supervised by John Nelson (Gladiator), are really good, although at no time do you feel that what you see is not generated by computer graphics, especially the robot Sonny, played by Alan Tudyk (Knights heart).). The actor brought the robot to life in the same way that Andy Serkis played Gollum in The Lord of the Rings. All of Tudyks body and facial movements were captured and transferred to a digital model, created by designer Patrick Tatopoulos (Independence Day) and inserted into the film in post-production. The result is fantastic and quite realistic.The adaptation was directed by Alex Proyas in a sublime way, managing to convey a real human nature of the future, both the evolution of technology and the relationship between humans and the possible existence of robots. The film looks more like the technology of the future in todays world, no exaggeration in clothes or in the way of acting. The action scenes are constant in the film, but Alex makes the investigative scenes more interesting, leaving us glued to the screen to know what will finally happen and the secrets that exist to be revealed.I, Robot manages to feed ethical discussions about people's relationship with technology and the limits of the power we should attribute to it. In this way, Asimov was able to contribute in several areas at the same time: for science fiction fans, whether in books or movies, for robotics scholars and for us, who are increasingly dependent on machines. Asimov began writing his stories in reaction to the 1930s cliché of the Frankenstein-style robot rebelling against its creator - but Proyas and company eventually adopted that for an ending that offers plenty of satisfying twists and turns.It's an old-fashioned but nonetheless thought-provoking premise, helped along by Proyas turbulent direction, flying almost nauseatingly around his sets in an apparent effort to resurrect the summer movie cliché roller coaster ride. The effects, arguably the best of the year, only add to the excitement as serial rows of evil robots cram into a building, cram into a speeding car or slaughter previous generations of useful drones.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
True to Asimov's Vision,"I have to re-create this review because some brown-nose ran to daddy about one of my other reviews, and this one disappeared in the debacle.I have been reading Science Fiction and Asimov in particular since the 60's - And so I was excited that they were finally making Asimov's anthology ""I, Robot"" into film.But when I saw the first previews I thought they were just Hollywood-ising the book. I was against the idea of this Movie when I saw those reviews. I did not want to see it, because I thought, they were ""ruining the story."" But when it comes down to it, the stories in book form of ""I, Robot"" are simply not the best Robot stories Asimov wrote. Before he passed away, he introduced the idea of the Robot ""Sonny"" in one of his last Susan Calvin stories. The Robot was not named ""Sonny"" but it had Aspects that Sonny will show in this film.But most of the other aspects of this film, are in other Robot stories and books. There is a vast underground menagerie, which is shown in a small part in the film — not in detail. This film references ""The Caves of Steel"" - The vast underground Robot factory (Although, I think the Caves of Steel may have been on Venus, I'll have to re-read that book).Del Spooner (Will Smith) is a cop, who is as biased against Robots as an Archie-Bunker type may have been biased against colour in the 50's and 60's. But Robots are safe, aren't they? At least U.S. Robotics says so, with Asimov's ""Three Laws of Robotics"":1) A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.2) A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.But Spooner just does not trust Robots. Does not ""Like their Kind."" But he has a secret, he does not like talking about: Why does Spooner never use is left arm? There is a reason for this, which is revealed in the story. Actually as the film progresses, we see him starting to use it, until we see what is actually going on.Susan Calvin is a ""Robot Psychologist"" - Or is she the Dumbest ""Smart Person"" Spooner has ever met? In this film she is depicted by Bridget Moynahan, at first as a professional ""iceberg"" - Or, as a ""Human Robot"" - She has very robotic qualities. Calvin works with Robots, Likes them, was raised by a Robot ""Lenny"" (LNE) in the book-So for her, they are safe.But one of the creators of U.S. Robotics, Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell), who knew Spooner, apparently kills himself by jumping from a high room in the U.S. Robotics building - Or Did he? We can't dismiss The Robot, ""Sonny""-being in the room at the time. Why does this Robot read ""Hansel and Gretel?""In a scene taken from an Illustration straight from Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine, we see Sonny jump from the same window Lanning ""fell"" from - The imagery is exactly like a panel drawing from a story in that magazine.There are curt nods like this, to all of Asimov's Robot works all through this film.And so at first I was not pleased that this film did not exactly follow the stories in the Anthology ""I, Robot"" - But as I kept watching it, I started realsing, whoever wrote this screenplay filled it with little things from the line of Robot novels and stories-The ""Robot Riots"" — those are there, in the film but not the same way as the book.I highly praise Alex Proyas for giving us this peek into the whole Mind of Asimov - And a true fan of his works will see the things I see. I am as purist as the next guy, but I have read harlan Ellison's 1990's screenplay for his vision of ""I, Robot"" - And he attempted to bridge all of the stories in the book with a framing story that tried to connect them all - It did not work very well, as much as I like the attempt.And at the end of Asimov's career as a writer, he was introducing ideas, like ""Do Robots Dream"" - There is a section of the movie where they have Lanning's voice from a recorded lecture, talking about things Robots will do, that defy any explanation other than that they are a new form of life. And also the idea that a the Robot Brain of Chicago - ""V.I.K.I"" - Virtual Interactive Kinetic Intelligence"" — may pervert the Three Laws, making it necessary to create the 4th, or Zeroth Law of Robotics:0. A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.This is all in the film if you look. And most important, the Robot ""Sonny"" played well by Alan Tudyk of Firefly and Dollhouse, the robot who was made for a special purpose by Lanning himself - It never occurred to me that this could be the origins of ""R. Daneel Olivaw"" which is the Robot Detective in ""The Naked Sun"" and ""The Caves of Steel.""And so I have tried to talk about this film without giving away the whole story - If I have inadvertently done this, I will gladly mark ""Spoilers""-The only spoiler I can really add, is that at the end of the film where Sonny is standing above the rest of the gathered Robots on the remains of Lake Michigan - This is another image straight from the annals of Asimov's writings. And as such, very powerful.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Decent sci-fi drama,"Decent sci-fi drama.Set in the year 2035, robots are commonplace and are becoming more and more sophisticated. A veteran cop, Del Spooner (played by Will Smith), is called in to investigate the apparent suicide of a friend and leading robotics expert, Dr Alfred Lanning (played by James Cromwell). He is quite cynical about robots and is convinced that a robot killed him. However, Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood), CEO of the corporation who designed and builds the robots, and that Dr Lanning worked for, isn't too happy with his investigations...Very intriguing, initially. Sort of a futuristic murder mystery, with a prime suspect a non-human. However, the movie does reveal its hand too soon, after which it is mostly just an action movie, unfortunately.Ultimately, entertaining enough. Just a pity the writer and director couldn't maintain the atmosphere of the first 30-40% of the movie and gave in to the temptation of making an action movie.Good performance by Will Smith in the lead role.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A Potent Elixir of Asimov Diluted Into 40 Ounces of Ghetto,"OK, I think the Asimov fans already knew this was a loose recreation of the original and personally, I have no problems with movies based on books which end up almost nothing like the book. In my opinion, this movie couldn't stand alone as a great piece of cinema and only has the 'I, Robot' name to give it any validity.My biggest issue as one may guess from my summary is Will Smith's ghetto, flippant attitude throughout the movie. From the first scene of Smith leaving his apartment, he walks down the street with a scowl on his face, bumping into people, and dew-rag over his ear just dripping with 'thug'. Just like in ID-4 and Men in Black, Smith faces life-threatening circumstances with a sarcastic and improbable facade. Nothing is ever scary or serious to the characters he plays. Not the aliens chasing him in Independence Day, not the giant killer-cockroach in Men in Black, and not hundreds of killer-robots in this movie. Smith retorts to ever threat with a stereotypically black attitude. His confrontation with his boss when he loses his badge is nothing short of ridiculous. He stomps off shouting and throwing a tantrum like a stereotypical, over-entitled minority. For me it's disgusting and tired. I think Will Smith can be funny and charming. I like that he took a break from music during the early 90's when hip-hop was saturated with hateful gansta-rap, finally returning when things settled down with a decent album. I don't know why he continues to play roles where he assumes these arrogant roles, fronting everyone off wherever he goes.True to her character in the book, Bridget Moynahan plays a decent Dr. Calvin. Cold, intelligent, and logical.If you're an Asimov fan, don't expect the book or anything Asimov would have approved.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Better than you might suspect.,"Will Smith is back in the sci-fi genre, fortunately not as a man in black. ""I Robot"" is a different kind of movie that blends paranoia with CGI in a pretty good way. The future is for once not a dark place were every one wears Ray-Bans and it always rains, but it is however full of robots. The people seem to have forgotten everything ""Terminator"" was supposed to learn us. Smith is a police officer and the only person in the movie who doesn't trust robots. Everybody else makes fun of him because of this. Well I guess you can see were it goes from here, but ""I robot"" actually manages to pull of some twists and surprises along the way, which makes it stand out among all the ""Bladerunner"" imitators out there, while it's never as complex as, say, anything Hitchcock ever did, it's still enough to make you stay awake and actually enjoy his movie. The reason for this pretty low score is that it's quite obvious that this is a Hollywood movie. There are just a bit too much dumb jokes and sometimes the CGI gets a too central role in it and by the way, all violence is PG.Still an entertaining movie.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Entertaining and fascinating future-vision,"I haven't been to the cinema this summer...in fact, I haven't been to the cinema since the première of ""The Day After Tomorrow"" (2004). So I decided to go for ""I, Robot"". A future-vision about the mankind living together with robots, and my childhood-hero Will Smith in the leading role. I figured this had to be some good popcorn-entertainment, and I'm not disappointed. But I did get a film that was quite different than what I had expected.The year is 2035, and people are living in harmony with robots that are designed and programmed to protect and obey orders from all people. We follow a police officer named Del Spooner (played by Will Smith), who is very sceptic about the robots after he had an bad experience with a robot, years ago. One day, Spooner is immediately being contacted when an old doctor named Alfred Lanning (played by James Cromwell) commits suicide. Dr. Lanning had just played an important role in the process of creating a ""new and better"" robot-model. No one understands why he would kill himself, but it turns out that Lanning knew something about the new robot-models that mankind never would be prepared for...Something that struck me from the beginning of, was that ""I, Robot"" suffered from an very bad start. The opening was full of clichés and all about Will Smith's character walking around saying ""cool and funny"" lines, that were far from funny in my opinion. It didn't exactly make me ""look forward"" to the rest of the film, but thankfully the film did elevate from the point when Dr. Lanning was found dead. This is when it becomes a entertaining and fascinating future-vision about robots.I came to the cinema to see robots. As a huge fan of the ""Terminator"" films, I have to say that I find myself fascinated by robots, in some way. And the robot-part didn't disappoint me. The robot called Sonny, who's a different robot with feelings and intelligence, impressed me and caught my attention. As a future-vision the film has some interesting elements, and I liked the way future-Chicago is being portrayed. A little flaw is that I think the setting of the story should've been further into the future. I mean...I doubt that we will see hoover-vehicles, robots and a technology like that in 30 years from now.Will Smith is an good actor, no doubt about that...but this is not exactly a role written for him to show his talent. He has his moments in this film, but the problem is, as mentioned earlier, that he is given to many cliché-full ""one-liners"". But as the film goes on there is fewer of them, and he also comes with some lines that actually ARE funny. As for the rest of the cast I don't really feel that there's anyone that has to be mentioned. So let's just say that ""I, Robot"" is a film where the actors aren't the main attraction, in my opinion.Over all...""I, Robot"" is very good entertainment. Good Special Effects, good action, fascinating at times, thrilling at times and the plot is also solid. But after watching it I can't help feeling that it had the potential of being an excellent science-fiction movie, if some parts had been taken better care of. But despite it's down-sides, it was worth the visit to the cinema.7.5 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Top movie!,"In a year that has generally been disappointing in terms of the big budget films. It finally seems that the 2nd half of the year could be getting better. Spidey's second outing was excellent, while Bourne Supremacy and indeed this have been good. Far eclipsing earlier big budget limp, flops, Troy, Chronicles Of Riddick, Passion Of Christ, King Arthur and Van Helsing. The bad films still though outweighing good films like Spidey, and Harry Potter three. Still overall this year, like last year has had a good amount of good films, largely made up from the smaller films like Shaun Of The Dead, Lost In Translation and School Of Rock. There is a promising list of upcoming films coming out from directors like Oliver Stone, Michael Mann and also Terry Gilliam, so overall I can't really be too disappointed at this year's standard. Indeed it's almost up at last year's level, but last year had Return Of The King to really up it. I suppose the lack of any new middle earth adventures was always going to make it a difficult year to be able top 2003.Anyway as a fan of Alex Proyas, whose earlier works The Crow, and Dark City are personal favourites, I was looking forward immensely to this film. Now I truth be told, after the first proper trailer, I was nervous. The first footage trailer, not the spoof NS5 advert, did kind of make it look as if the film would suck, and be a brainless blockbuster, but then again that was a similar problem with the Dark City promotion. The trailers after that improved immensely thankfully while still leaning towards the blockbuster angle. The film has blockbuster elements but has more too it, hence the above average ratings compared to your usual action extravaganza. I Robot is a very good film. It's good fun, it's exciting and despite feelings that it has picked bits from superior similarly science fiction films like the Terminator and Minority Report, it's good stuff. Now this is nowhere near as good as Proyas's early works but still it has some depth and raise questions without really having the philosophical rich textual side that his films The Crow, Dark City and indeed classics like Blade Runner, Minority Report and The Matrix had. They were films that can be vastly repeated for the literary, biblical and philosophical references and the great touches. While I-Robot raises interesting questions and has some biblical and sociological connotations, they are questions raised in many other films. It does not seem original, but then again many of the films raising points which appear in this film were inspired by the short stories of Isaac Asimov who wrote the original story this film was based off. All his stories revolved around technology and robots in particular and were based around the three laws of robotics. 1 a Robot will not harm a human being. 2. A Robot must obey a human at all time except when it conflicts with the first law and 3, A Robot can defend itself unless it conflicts with the first two laws. These laws that Asimov created are essential in this film and they are key to how the plot of I-Robot transpires.The plot revolves around Del Spooner. He's a cop who has a deep dislike for Robots and despairs that at this time (2035) humans have become very dependant on them. When the creator of the NS-5 robots and all robots, apparently commits suicide, Spooner is called in to investigate. He is suspicious of the death and believes it could be a murder but since the room that doctor Lanning was in when he jumped was locked and no-one else was in it, bar some Robot's, Spooner believes it must have been a Robot. His prejudice drives him throughout his investigation; he suffers from tunnel vision in his pursuit of bringing down this Robot and in effect the whole lot of them. It is only later as the plot unfolds he looks at the whole picture and realises his actions have been wrong. The main suspect is a seemingly malfunctioning Robot, who calls himself Sonny and seems to have developed human emotions. Sonny is found at the crime scene, hiding when Spooner investigates and fleas from the scene. Later Spooner has him in for questioning and is very suspicious at how Sonny is behaving. As the plot transpires, he begins to suspect Lawrence Robertson, Lanning's partner, of involvement in Lanning's death considering it was on the eve of a massive launch of a new NS-5 that will be in nearly every home in America. As the film progresses Spooner begins to uncover the reasoning behind Sonny's emotions and uncovers a frightening truth. The plot is clever and develops well as it seems a glitch in the 3 laws means trouble for the human race as the Robot's AI's develop.The cast are good. I like Will Smith but I was weary of his casting here. Would it be too Will Smith, as the trailers suggested? Well this is some typical Will talk but Smith does well with a character given some depth. It's a good role that makes up for his two previous disappointing sequels to Bad Boys and Men In Black. It's his best performance since his Oscar nod for Ali. Bridget Moynahan is also good as Robot psychologist Susan Calvin who works for NSR and ends up supporting Spooners investigations after initially believing he was paranoid. Also there is good support from Bruce Greenwood and Chi McBride. However, Alan Tudyk steals the show as Sonny, or should I say Tudyks vocal performance. The robots were a worry in this film because they could have been overdone and they have such cool robots like The Terminator to contend with. The robots are portrayed well in this and especially the most worrying one, Sonny. His character is very good though, and intriguing. His creator has spent time making Sonny unique from his brothers and he develops emotions, has dreams. It raises questions about whether a robot which has essentially it's own soul now and acts and re-acts like a human should have the rights to a proper existence. Sonny has malfunctioned and is to be dismantled but essentially his human characteristics and three thinking could argue that he has a right of existence. After all if a human was in a vegetative state and showed little signs of a soul they would still have a right of existence. Anyone who worried about the portrayal of this robot would be pleasantly surprised. This is largely because Tudyk nails the character so well and makes him very likeable and sympathetic.Alex Proyas is on fine form, and while it isn't him at his wild, dark and goth best he still shows he is definitely a director to look out for. I just hope he doesn't become a director for hire to do blockbusters every 1 or 2 years. I want his next to be meaningful and personal like Dark City and Crow, which were more moderate budget and probably with more creative freedom. A hit like I Robot can only help his choices for his next movie. Visually Proyas has shown he is one of the best in the business.  Visually this is good. Not as wild and expressionistic as his other two films but still good. The cinematography is good and crisp with good use of colour and shadow. The production design is based around a future where everything barring the robots is similar to today. It's essentially the present with a little polish a few sliding doors and NS-4's walking your dog. The production design doesn't seem entirely original; it has similarity to Minority Report, including the cars and the general design in architecture. The Robots are nicely designed. It's an interesting design, very similar to Bjork's music video All Is Full Of Love, extremely similar, to the point you feel that the robots are ripped off, but still it's their debut in the world of movies so I'm not to bothered, the problems are surely between the designers of that music video and this movie. The special effects are outstanding, top of the range. The way the robots integrate into crowds of people are impressive and also Proyas uses the visual effects superbly as he did in Dark City. The action here is also great stuff. What you want form a summer movie is spectacular action, style and thrills and you get that. To be honest the film loses a little when it goes into action overdrive in the last half hour. I generally thought that the first hour and a half as the plot develops was the best. Generally Sci-Fi films are stronger in the opening and have most of their action near the end, look at The Matrix, Minority Report. I always love the exposition in these movies.  Also kudos to Marco Beltrami who does a good job composing here. The score could have just ripped off many other sci-fi films but it does something that has a unique style and has if anything similarities at times to the score of Dark City. Proyas must have had input in to the score.Overall this is a decent sci-fi movie. Rarely are sci-fi movies very good but this is certainly one of the better in recent years. While it doesn't stand up to the best ones like Terminator, Alien, Blade Runner and Minority Report it is good in its own right and that is first and foremost all you can ask for from a summer blockbuster. ****",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Fun but Inconsistent,"I had very low expectations for this movie. I thought the previews looked dumb, I hated Will Smith's one-liners, and I thought the special effects looked so-so. After seeing it I can say it was entertaining but still nothing to cheer about. I will admit that through the beginning and middle of the movie, I was enjoying the show. The special effects are smooth, well done, and fun. Will Smith is more subdued than the previews show and the mystery is well established. Then by the end it all kind of falls apart - the way the mystery is solved isn't quite that clever, and the ending wasn't what I thought it should have been. I also saw a lot of sequences that were so Robocop or Terminator. Do moviemakers think we're so dumb that we won't recognize some of these action scenes? Or that they think the moviegoing public needs to see them over and over? So a few things could have been edited out and the ending could have been less new-age but overall this is a good escape at the movies.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Most definitely one of 2004's best blockbusters,"Will Smith films are always worth watching. They aren't always very good; but they're always worth watching. The reason that they're always worth watching is that they all have one thing in common; Will Smith. Will Smith has always been worth watching; from the early days in The Fresh Prince of Bel Air, to today in I, Robot; the guy has a very pronounced star power. He more than has enough to carry a film all on his own, as he proved with Men in Black and Wild Wild Westbut wait; there actually is a film under here.I, Robot is adapted from a novel by cult sci-fi writer, Isscar Asimov. It is evident that the film is adapted from a book throughout, as, despite all the explosions and stunts; the film does feel very old-school, and that is rare in today's blockbusters. Will Smith plays Del Spooner, a police inspector with a prejudice against robots. The story really starts when Dr. Alfred Lanning, the creator of the robots is killed in an apparent suicide. Will Smith, however, refuses to believe that this man merely killed himself and, naturally, believes that a robot is the murderer; and proceeds to investigate. As you may have guessed from that description; this film takes obvious influence from classics such as Blade Runner. With it's vision of the future, the film does feel very much like a lighter version of said film throughout.The first thing you will notice about I, Robot is that Will Smith isn't believable as a police inspector. It is set in the future, and maybe in the future police inspectors will be smart talking, cocky, back-chatting, swaggering womanisers; but it just seems like he was cast because he's Will Smith. However, as I mentioned earlier; Will Smith has the star power, and he is the reason to watch; so as far as I'm concerned, he can be as unbelievable as he wants and I'll still watch. The rest of the cast is pretty much irrelevant; they all perform to an adequate standard, but overall; they are testament to Will's star power. Alex Proyas, a man that made his name with the fairly rated; The Crow, takes the directors chair. Proyas isn't a director that will be featuring in any 'best director of all time' discussions, but he does a good job here. The film looks lovely, and it's well paced. Although it features explosions and high-octane stunts (which are all well executed), the film obviously wants to make it's story the main focus; and that is admirable in any film, especially a blockbuster. Not only is the story behind I, Robot engaging and interesting; but it's also deep and complex enough to get you thinking.

apex,"This ""film"" is the culmination of everything that is bad about modern film. unnecessary slow motion, unnecessary flipping/jumping/somersaults, unnecessary characters, unnecessary dialogue.... basically unnecessity. (is that a word? well, it's just been invented by I, Robot.)What happened to practicality? (i.e. the car garage, the skin spray) the only tool that shows a combination of futuristic and realistic function is the card swipe at the coffee shop.What happened to showing respect for women? (i.e. smith's character does nothing but degrade the doctor for the better part of the film, and yet she still ""wants"" him. WHERE IS THE TENSION? I'll tell you where, good looks and not admiration or common ground)What happened to a detective that detects? Smith did nothing but sit around and feel sorry for himself, complaining to other people, and when they said something that sparked a thought he was off. this is such a lame way to get the story from point b-c-d-etc... it was OK once, but not several times in a row. (speaking of several times in a row, what was the ""I'm snoring and not listening to you joke? Twice In One Scene?)What happened to the small parts in a movie being somewhat meaningful and not just a tool to promote rescue scenes? Shia LaBeouf (the kid) is in the movie for a total of TWO SCENES, we know that A-he degrades women, and B-he knows Smith....... so of COURSE we should care about him and whether or not he comes to harm,What happened to Hero's? let's just forget that there are people, women and children everywhere getting attacked by robots and selfishly save the only person withing my view that I have an acquaintance with. and why did he have to ramp his bike through the air, showing off, while the doctor was somehow able to reach the same distance in a matter of seconds on foot.don't get me wrong, I'm all for spectacle. but I'm also all for a shred of realism and meaning.I have to say I've never laughed quite so hard at a film in a long time. so thanks Alex.I pray for the swing of the social pendulum back to simpler techniques, simpler stories and simpler everything else in films...... but mainly simpler techniques.Big Budget Action films: ""you so have to die""",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"The key word is ""suggested""","""I, Robot"" had me riveted to my seat for the entire movie. Everything - the plots, characters, FX, action - came together in one great package.

The Three Laws of Robotics are his, as is the name of the robot engineer/researcher (""Dr Susan Calvin""), and the main premise of the story: that a death occurred and a robot was at the scene.

The robot...,"""I, Robot"" is an Action - Sci-Fi movie in which we watch a police officer in 2035 investigating a crime believing that was caused by a robot. His belief leads him to some new findings that are very important for the future of humanity.I liked this movie because it was entertaining and it had a simple but interesting plot which consisted of some plot twists that made it even more interesting. The direction which was made by Alex Proyas, it was very good and he did an excellent job on it. He presented very well his main characters, his back story but also his dreams and his fears, something that made us understand him even better. The interpretation of Will Smith who played as Del Spooner was very good. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Bridget Moynahan's who played as Susan Calvin and Alan Tudyk's who played as Sonny.

Time and time again this film lingers on the spectacle when it hits every small moment.What were they thinking?No, this is not vintage Will Smith, and yes the female lead is pretty bad, but the film still works. Despite a completely unreal world this film still works. Despite the fact that the film was wounded by Smith battling Proyas for the shape of the film, it still works whenever the small personal moment, or the moments of ideas, for example Smith's first meeting with James Cromwell floored me in its simplicity and perfection... and left me to wonder what this film might have been.See this on TV where I'm certain the small moments will play better than on the big screen.

One of the better films of the year so far.,"Yes, it's true. I liked it. On the surface it's a simple future-cop story with lots of pretty graphics and an amiable star. But it did something (albeit for only a short time) that most films this year haven't. It made me think. Of course, once you figure out whodunnit, it's mostly just an action ride to the finish. But at least it tried.Most surprising of all here is Will Smith. He doesn't get to ""Will Smith-ify"" the movie too much. In fact, he's very restrained and, it has to be said, very mature in this role. Only a couple of times does he get to cut loose, but on the whole I'm beginning to believe there is a serious actor hidden away inside him.The film as a whole doesn't take itself too seriously, even though the subject matter merits further thought. Likewise the graphics are pretty good (and this is one of the few movies this year that I've said that about) and work much better than I had feared.There are a couple of moments that made me frown, most notably the spinning car-in-tunnel scene. But on the whole nothing made me scowl at the screen.I've not read the book by Asimov, so I can't comment on how faithful the movie version is to the book. But, much like Starship Troopers, that matters less if the film is good and entertains you. And I, Robot entertains very nicely.Worth a look.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Just okay.,"I didn't expect too much from I, Robot and it lived up to my (lack of) expectations. I, Robot is a typical of any Will Smith movie, it was similar to Independence Day or Men in Black.

The action in I, Robot was fun to watch, but there was not as much action in it as I expected there would be. I also thought that it was very impressive how much character development took place in the character of Sonny, a robot.

Smith does a good job of milling his way through the film looking good and saying funny one liners, but there is something missing and I cant put my finger quite on what it is. it could be the completely unnecessary slow motion shots it seems to break into at random points through the fight sequences, it could be the totally cheesy mentor relationship between the cop (smith) and the young rapscallion or the totally absurd motorbike scenes.

One Of My Favourite Will Smith Movies,"Continuing my plan to watch every Will Smith movie in order, I come to His second movie of 2004, I, Robot.Plot In A Paragraph: In 2035, a technophobic cop (Smith) investigates a crime that may have been perpetrated by a robot, which leads to a larger threat to humanity.I'll admit from the off of this review I, Robot, it is one of my favourite Will Smith movies.Will Smith is at his charismatic best. James Crowmell (an actor, whom I adore) is at his usual high standard, Bridget Moynahan is OK in her role and Bruce Greenwood does what Bruce Greenwood does and not a lot more. But while Will Smith is at the core of the movie and generally carries most of it, for me the heart of the movie comes from Alan Tudyk as Sonny.However it's not all good, Shia Lebouf is awful. Cringe worthingly bad. He is the weak link in the cast, his character serves no purpose at all!!

Surprisingly good action film,"I'm not usually a big fan of action movies, but this one definitely gets my vote.

Furthermore, the graphics were surprisingly subtle for a film of this genre, but as a result perfectly complemented rather than detracted from the acting. In terms of plot there were one or two aspects that seemed slightly questionable, but on the whole these were by no means sufficient to detract from the fact that it was a great script.

Good.  Not great.,"Considering all the money that must have been spent on the seamless futuristic special effects and sets, not to mention on Will Smith, ""I, Robot"" should have been more than it was. This movie is entertaining enough but far too formulaic. Hero saves world. We've seen it a thousand times before. There is enough humor and action and suspense to keep things interesting, but ""I, Robot"" lacks real depth. The movie does discuss the morals of robotics interacting with humans, and puts an empathetic face on the main robot character, Sonny. Yet, this film missed the opportunity to be more clever and darker. It gets far too immersed in big scene computer graphics and lacks the intensity of a robot thriller it could have been.

vacuous piece of crap,"After perusing the large amount of comments on this movie it is clear that there are two kinds of science fiction movie-goers. There are the ones who are well read, extremely literate, and intelligent. They know the history of the genre and more importantly they know to what heights it can reach in the hands of a gifted author. For many years science fiction languished in the basement of literature. Considered my most critic to be little more than stories of ray guns and aliens meant for pre-pubescent teenagers. Today's well read fan knows well this history, and knows the great authors Asimov, Heinlein, Bradbury, and Ellison, who helped bring science fiction out of that basement. In doing so they created thought provoking, intelligent stories that stretched the boundaries and redefined the human condition. This well informed fans are critical of anything Hollywood throws at them. They are not critical for it's own sake, but look upon each offering with a skeptical eye. (As they should as Hollywood's record has been less than stellar.) To these fans the story must take supreme importance. They cannot be fooled by flashy computer graphics, and non stop action sequences. When the emperor has no clothes they scream it the loudest.The second type of science fiction movie goer has little knowledge about the written aspect of the genre. (Look at many of the above comments that state ""Well I haven't read the book or anything by this author...) Their total exposure to science fiction is from movies or the Scifi channel. They are extremely uncritical, willing to overlook huge plot holes, weak premises, and thin story lines if they are given a healthy dose of wiz bang action and awesome special effects. They are, in effect, willing to turn off their critical thinking skills (or maybe they never had them!) for the duration of the movie. Case in point, I Robot. While supposedly based on Asimov's short stories and named after one of his novels, it contains little of what Asimov wrote and even less of what he tried to tell us about humanity and our robotic creations. (Those of you that will run out and buy I, Robot will be very much surprised-this movie isn't even based on that story at all!)The film has enormous plot holes, that at some points are stretched to the limits of credulity. I won't point them out. I won't spoon feed you. You need to practice you thinking skills and discover them for yourself. The characters, which are named after many of Asimov's characters, do not possess the critical intelligence that was a hallmark of his stories. The plot itself with all it's action sequences goes against everything that the author stood for. His belief that humanity possesses the capacity to solve problems using their minds, not their fists, is vital to understanding his vision of the future. In short, other than the name, their is very little of Isaac in anything about this movie. There will always be those uncritical (i.e. unthinking) who will state: ""The movie doesn't have to be like the book. Due to the medium, movies sometimes require that changes be made."" But what about a case where the movie never even tried to stay close to the book (or books) from the start? What if all they took from the written work was the title? This begs the question: Why tarnish a great body of work by slapping it's title on your vacuous piece of crap? Save money and don't buy the rights to the works. Title it something else. Don't use the character's names. Believe me no one will accuse you of plagiarism. In fact it won't matter what you title it to the unread moviegoer who accepts everything you throw at him. But it will upset those who read, who think, who are unwilling to simply let you give them a pretty light show.I, Robot, like much of Hollywood's take on the genre, pushes Science fiction back down into that basement it lived in years ago. Hollywood could not do this alone. It takes an uncritical mindless audience that will accept puerile dredge like this.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Continues the intriguing topic of what it means to be human,"Robots in the arts have always been intriguing. Isaac Asimov promoted them in science fiction to remind us as humans to celebrate our emotions and imperfections, usually coveted by our mechanical creations even with the prospect of death as the ultimate payment due.Director Alex Proyas' ('The Crow') 'I, Robot,' based on Asimov's story, packs every robot cliché into a year 2035 morality tale, visually satisfying (The CGI, like good robots, is at the service of the story) and regurgitating the usual robot notions: Frankenstein's monster is there with his conflicted maker; the Maria clone from 'Metropolis' with her sleek form; Robbie from 'Forbidden Planet' with his warm, human-like solicitation; Hal from '2001' with his dangerous deference only slightly hiding his intentions; and Data, 'Star Trek's' almost human techie, coming closest to the ideal.More robotic than 'I, Robot's' robots is Will Smith's ('Ali') Del Spooner, guess what, a wise-ass, rebellious cop who is the only one who intuits the danger of the robotic rumblings. He unsurprisingly enlists the help of the beautiful, coldly calculating scientist, Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan, 'The Recruit'), who, believe it or not, comes to believe the robots can violate their 3 basic rules of serving humans to their own annihilation if necessary. US Robotics head, Lawrence Robinson (Bruce Greenwood), is, of course, the major suspect in the incipient revolution, ostensibly because of the usual world-domination dreams.'Sunny' (Alan Trudyk, 'Dodgeball') is the new generation robot, not as overtly ambitious as his forebears and more human because of his resignation to decommissioning while exploring human emotions. Spooner, on the other hand, seems to be more of a robot, which, like some contemporary leaders, sees the enemy as a danger to be overcome rather than a work in progress to be gently ushered into peaceful co-existence. Also, the rogue robots talk about dominating humans for their own good, just as neocons offer preemption and occupation rather than debate.The last line of 'I, Robot' addresses the human urge for liberty and the necessity of searching for it. The film adds nothing new to the genre but athletic robots and robotic leads, yet it at least continues the intriguing topic of what it means to be human. The caveat is, as Albert Schweitzer said, that 'the advance to fully developed inhumanity is only a question of time.'",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Would Isaac have approved?,"I used to work in NYC in publishing more than a few years back, and during that time I got to meet and hang out with the great Isaac Asimov, who discussed with me all sorts of things, including his obsession with robots. While watching this film, which is loosely based on his ideas, I was wondering if he would have approved of it, and my educated conclusion is. ..yes and no.I think he would have enjoyed the way the world of the not-so-far-off future looked in the film, and I think he would have liked the way the robots looked.  I think he would have had no problem with Will Smith, and I think he would have found the film to be entertaining overall, a slick little piece of summer-blockbusting.  At the same time, he probably would have thought it was tritely simplistic and cliched, certainly not as deeply thought-provoking as it could have been, on so many levels.  And if these indeed would have been his feelings about the movie, I would have had to agree with him ~ they didn't completely 'ruin' it by any stretch, but it just didn't have the weight it could have had, ultimately - when you left the theatre you weren't still thinking about it, or at least I wasn't, and in this respect it was the perfect summertime escapist fare.

Lots of things from Asimov books,"As a child I devoured as many Asimov books as I could. I really love the technical SF books written with a vision that promises us a bright long happy future.Bicentennial Man was not close to the story written by Asimov. I, Robot is on many points equally far away from the story. That's why the start of the movie deservedly says ""Suggested by..."" and not ""Inspired by..."" and certainly not ""Based on..."".But I'm quite sure that Isaac Asimov would have liked this movie much better than Bicentennial Man. So many things from his other books are included in this movie, and so many important parts of the story ""I, Robot"" are included, that Asimov lovers really have to see this movie.The end is a real cliffhanger. Signs of the zeroth law (law numero 0) of robotics are being shown at the end. In later stories, Asimov added that zeroeth law, making a total of 4 laws of robotics:0) A robot may not injure humanity or, through inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.1) A robot may not harm a human being, or through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm, except where that would conflict with the Zeroth Law.2) A robot must obey orders given it by a human being, except where that would conflict with the Zeroth and First Laws.3) A robot must protect its own existence except where that would conflict with the Zeroth, First or Second Laws.I hope they make a sequel to this movie.

Better Than Expected,"24 July 2004. Isaac Asimov might have turned over in his grave at the trailers for this movie, but after watching the whole movie, I gather he might have settle for a mild approval though the primary core values of his Robot series were not strictly followed. This movie was better than expected and it wasn't so stereotypical that the movie wasn't just another them vs. us movie. A little more complex, a little more deep, this sci fi version of I, Robot presents Wil Smith with his usual wit (though perhaps too much of the same action figure) with a more and more deeper substance as his performances in movies continue. Not as finely nuanced and complicated as Isaac Asimov would have hoped, but perhaps his Robot series and Foundation series like Dune and Lord of the Rings before them, may become a serious mini-movie series in reality if the evolution of the movie industry can somehow capture the genius of this sci fi author's work.

You have a solid premise, some excellent visual effects (and we are not people impressed with CGI), some excellent twists and nice acting.I Robot doesn't use an ""Independence Day"" appeal for human patriotism to mask poor acting and execution.

An action-thriller with a curiously interesting point,"I did not exactly have high expectations for this movie, thinking it would simply be another basic Hollywood action-flick. Having said that, I was left with a completely different impression after seeing I, Robot, to the extent that it lives up to the same kind of curious experimentations with interesting concepts as Minority Report, which in my opinion is an excellent science-fiction thriller.I haven't read the book, so I can't base my judgements, as so many have done here, upon the excellence of the novel and how much the movie differs from it (but, let's face it, that's how films based on novels often are; It is easier to express oneself through words than it is to compress an entire novel into two-hours.) I know the movie left out important, and some less important, events that take place in the novel, but I, for one, find this understandable. For a book-to-film kind of movie, this is in the 'above-average' group, unlike movies such as Dreamcatcher, which was a sheer misinterpretation.I, Robot explores a very interesting, and often bothering dilemma, where logical thinking replaces sentimental values through cold rationing. It also embarks upon the conflict of giving a machine an identity, at which point it becomes self-aware. The three laws of robotics are defined so that human beings cannot come to harm, according to Isaac Asimov, in which case the self-awareness of a machine would conflict with these rules, creating a sort of a paradox; The machine has rules that it is programmed to follow, but develops a sense of self-awareness that contradicts some of those rules for the sake of self-defense (an inherent response to all 'living' organisms that are aware of their existence).The exploration of this paradox actually provides the movie with a point, unlike so many of today's action-thrillers. The visual experience is breathtaking, with excellent camera-work and good, but not excessive, visual effects. Will Smith's role, as usual, contributes subtle comic elements that help relieve the 'tension' and remind us that this is still entertainment.A lot of people have also criticized the excessive advertisement in the movie, and I can definitely see why. But the way I see it, Alex Proyas very deliberately exaggerates these advertisements and makes them too obvious, to aggravate witty, cunning humor at the expense of those corporations that are advertised - at least in Denmark the entire audience understood the obviousness. I know I may sound pseudo-analytical when I say this, but the advertisements might actually form a sub-theme in the movie, namely that of commercialization of our society. I mean, obviously this is the way things are headed and I would not be surprised if in thirty years advertisement has doubled or even quadripled from what it is today.All that said, I, Robot is a very good science-fiction thriller, that actually delves into some important issues as well as manages to entertain the viewer from start to end. It is difficult to come up with negatives because I have not read the novel, but from me, a movie needs to be pretty darn good to deserve even a 7/10 (3½/5). I gave I, Robot, 7, rather than 8 or 9 because it fails to take that final step that separates the sheep from the lambs.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The Return of Frankenstein,"When Isaac Asimov at the age of 14 read pulp SF-stories, he soon became fed up with the usual stereotype robot story: Mad, but brilliant scientist construct a robot that turns against its creator and have to be deactivated by the hero of the story. So, when he later became a SF-writer he created his famous three laws of robotic, to enable him to write stories, that was not infected by the Frankenstein Syndrome.The movie 'I, Robot' is named after Asimov's first collection of robot short stories. It uses his three laws and even some of the character's names. But the plot is far from being Asimovian! It is a typical Frankenstein story of the kind that Isaac Asimov would hate.For a genuine SF-fan who admires Isaac Asimov, this is a very sad film that demonstrates contempt for one of the true masters of science fiction!",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Still fairly true to Dr. Asimov's ideals,"OK, the movie has been in theaters for three weeks and I just now got around to seeing it. But I was much more favorably impressed than I expected to be.The bit that really impressed me was that the writing was tight - I would even say spare. Dr. Isaac Asimov was well known for concise, undecorative prose, with a sharp sense of humor. I always enjoyed reading his novels because he delivered excellent build-ups to logical (though often surprising) conclusions, and he got you there quickly with a minimum of meaningless bits of frou-frou. This movie does the same thing. The only thing I would have left out was the cat. (""I'm sorry, you're a cat, I'm black, it'll never work"" - what the heck was that supposed to mean?)Will Smith does his usual kick-butt summer-blockbuster star turn. Bridget Moynahan does a respectable job with the very difficult role of Dr. Susan Calvin - the deepest and most complex female character Asimov ever invented.Alan Tudyk must have really enjoyed playing a CGI character, it may have been the best role he's ever had - I'm glad to see him (excuse me, hear him) without any silly accent - and he put a lot of meat onto the dense-alloy bones of Sonny the robot.For those concerned with ""family"" issues: the shower scenes are handled with excellent circumspection. If you are totally against ever having your under-14 children exposed to an image of a naked human body, you shouldn't bring your kids, but believe me - Smith poses like a Rodin sculpture. Other than this and some mild cussing, such as every kid will hear in any school, I'd say this movie should meet most family standards. My 12-year-old was not embarrassed or uncomfortable at all.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Good, but should have been better","I, Robot is a very entertaining movie to watch.  The special effects are top notch and the actors are pretty good.  However, after a few hours go by since watching the movie, you feel like there should be something more. This is basically another cop who has a theory   that nobody believes until it is too late movie.  I have not read Asimov's original book but I would think it would something more than this cliched storyline.  I had the same problem with Minority Report two years ago.  Despite the faults of the movie, I do recommend the movie if you want to see an exciting thrill ride. As for the intellectual questions about man and machine, the Terminator films have gone down this path before and a lot better.  Still, the movie beats that overlong King Arthur flick.  7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

I starts as a futuristic detective story and becomes much more, although it doesn't go very deep, still this is a movie were story is at it's center, and the comes special effects, not another way around.Overall, one day there is definitely should be a sequel to this movie.

Much Better than I Expected,"The first thing to understand is Will Smith plays a relatively serious character, not his usual goofy persona. He makes a few wise cracks, but this is not a Men In Black IX.I most enjoyed the scenes of ordinary plausibly realistic daily life, such a robot working an a diner, and the touching scenes reminiscent of 2001 where a robot faced execution. There is an enormous amount of computer animation. Much of the vision of the future is thoughtful and informed by the latest science. It is not just a bunch of people running around in togas and making pretentious speeches.The problem with the movie is it keeps descending into mindless mechanised clone violence that is about as interesting as watching red and black ants fight and about as mindless. In these scenes the animation takes on silly, cheap cartoonish character that blows the illusion of reality. To make it worse, it is unclear who is fighting whom and why. All the robots are identical.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Well done Will Smith,"If you honestly think this is Will Smith's best performance then you obviously haven't watched ""Ali"" yet.I'll give Will Smith credit, he produced a damn good film and performance but it still was along the lines of 'Bad Boys 1 & 2', 'Men in Black', 'Enemy of the State' and lest we forget 'Wild Wild West'. Will Smith has massive potential if any of you remember his more serious films like 'Six Degrees of Separation' and 'Ali'.Back to 'I, Robot', what was wrong with it? Nothing really, I went to the cinema to be blown away and I did, it satisfies the hardcore movie nerds like myself.The special effects were out of this world, the robots were impressively designed, the car chase scene was smashing, script was okay and anything else I can give away in the film.Did I mention Will Smith has a nude scene?If I spoke about the film in general I'd practically give away the whole storyline because it's pretty straight forward.In conclusion go and rent out 'I, Robot', watch it with your mates on the weekend and don't have any expectations.Don't over-analyse it, just have a good time watching it.Thank you for your attention.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Quality blockbuster...clever and ambiguous, which is a change","I, Robot was never meant to be more than your typical blockbuster film. Still, it fulfills it's purpose: it is entertaining and surprisingly clever, which is a bonus. Also, the CGI ranks among the best I've seen in non-animated blockbuster films.After a scientist jumps to his death, Detective Spooner (Will Smith) is sent in to investigate. Spooner finds a murder suspect; to no surprise of his, but to the surprise of everyone one, he arrests a robot and brings him in for questioning. Despite being tied down by the three Robotic laws (I forget what they are, but one of them is not to kill), this robot (Sonny) can choose whether or not to follow them.The idea of a robot disobeying the three laws which it has to follow is quite clever, much like a human. Also, it talks of Spooner, who is a robot-hater, freeing the robots. It also believes that everyone and everything has a purpose in life: well-worn but true nonetheless. The evil robots in question believe that humanity should be protected from its own appetite for self-destruction, as humans built robots to serve and protect them in the first place. The action scenes are fittingly entertaining: the best one being where Spooner is confronted by a battalion of evil robots and almost crammed into the wall is the best one, although the one when Spooner is caught in a house during demolition and in the main building, where they have to kill the mainstream computer controlling the robots, are also eyecatching at first. However, the best part of the film is the CGI, no question. It ranks along the best I've seen in blockbusters. In contrast with the crude boxy contraptions I've seen in the past, this film paints the robots as being lifelike, with shiny exteriors and fluid motions. The cars and other machines also look suitably futuristic, along with the building interiors. Unusally for a blockbuster, the ending has an ambiguous feel to it, which is a change.However, like every blockbuster, I, Robot has flaws. Some of the acting is iffy, for example, Will Smith plays Detective Spooner in too much of an uptight, bitter, obnoxious way for him to be really likable. The woman is also too uptight and difficult to relate to, as are the rest of the human characters. I, Robot can also be frustratingly slow for a blockbuster, like the time from the scientist's death up to the car chase scene.Despite these faults, I, Robot is an above-average blockbuster which is certainly worth seeing.3.5/5 stars",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
one of the top movie of the year,"I, Robot. A must see movie. Loads better than I expected. I never liked black people (I'm not a racialist, of course, but I just can't see anything cute from a black guy.) But this movie, wow, I was totally magnetize by Will Smith, he's so hot! There's one scene at the beginning of the movie of him in a shower, it was ... my God, so sexy!And of course, there's another cute little boy (not little actually, grown a lot, but still very cute.)-- Shia LaBeouf, I have a problem in pronouncing his name. Anyway, he's very young and talented. He directed a short film and won an award. And he's also casted in Constantine, really a genius.The plot is simple.

For not one moment do you believe that the actors are staring at nothingness.WOW factor aside, the pacing in this movie was slightly off and the entire film feels empty. The filmmaker's vision of 2035 is shiny and dull. At least there weren't any flying cars in this one. As my friend and I departed the theater, he commented on how much this movie felt like a Dune novel.

a horrible piece of trash!,"Asimov must be turning over in his grave. This travesty of a film mocks everything that he stood for. Asimov, a devout pacifist, wanted to create a series of robot stories that did not rely on idiotic violence to advance the plot. His stories rely on humans (and robots) using intelligence and reasoning to solve problems. He also wanted to create stories that contradicted the all to clichéd ""Frankenstein"" motif. This film does exactly the opposite. It's quite obvious that the screenwriters casually browsed the books, selected a few choice names, and then proceeded to write a script that had the intellectual depth of a episode of Barney the purple dinosaur.The most tragic aspect of the multimillion dollar insult is that there already existed a wonderful award winning script by Harlan Ellison which has been printed in book form. This script weaved Asimov's disparate robot tales into an intellectually satisfying story that remained true to Asimov's vision. All true Science fiction fans (i.e readers- and I'm not talking about those of you who only read the latest Star wars or other movie novelization) should avoid this movie at all costs.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Fantastic science fiction film,"I robot is a great science fiction film starring the always affable Will Smith. When all of the dust from 2004's crumbling blockbusters has settled, I, Robot will likely emerge as the strongest mainstream motion picture of the summer. The best big-budget science fiction film since Minority Report, I, Robot gets high marks not only for storytelling but for its compelling vision of 2035 Chicago. Directed by Alex Proyas, who previously imagined the strikingly noir cityscapes of The Crow and Dark City, I, Robot takes ideas (and a character) presented in Isaac Asimov's classic anthology of nine short stories and uses them as a jumping-off point for a thrilling action-adventure movie. Although I, Robot isn't quite as pulse-pounding or intellectually challenging as Minority Report, it stimulates many of the same areas of the brain and causes the body to pump nearly as much adrenaline.

Good action film.,"I, Robot tells the story of a detective in the future who doesn't trust robotic technology at all. When a murder is committed, he believes a robot did the killing even though everyone tells him it's impossible. He goes on a hunt for the robot to find out the truth and winds up getting pulled into a mystery even he wasn't expecting. I, Robot is a good action movie, but it's purely for popcorn entertainment.The movie has some good messages about big businesses and technology, but all of that is washed away by the fact that the plot is mainly a guy with a futuristic gun shooting down robots. While this movie is really good to watch when nothing else is on or you want to get lost in a movie, it's not a movie that anyone should take seriously. It doesn't stick very close to the plot of Isaac Asimov's book, so fans of that might not like it. I high point is the special effects. The special effects are very good and the fight scenes are awesome.As for acting, it's all just okay. Will Smith was never that amazing to me. He's always the same guy. A smooth talker that makes witty jokes as he saves the world from ultimate destruction. Yes, he plays the part well, but let's see something different. Shia Lebouf is in here as the detective's younger friend, and though he doesn't have a lot of time on screen, his character is a little annoying.Overall, this movie is really good to watch, but it's not a masterpiece that deserves to be praised.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
It's Not An Adaptation.  It's a Tribute.,"As long as you remember that, I think you'll be impressed.Because really, this movie is surprisingly well-done, and the Asimovian themes resonate even moreso today than they did when he first wrote his stories. It's more than another expensive, retina-burning sci-fi fireball; ""I, Robot"" is a commentary on everything from the impact of new technology to what the concepts we call ""freedom"" and ""humanity"" really mean.The CGI is definitely some of the best out there, and the performances are nailed perfectly. Moynahan manages to play Susan Calvin as coldly as the robots she programs without looking wooden, and she beautifully weaves the character's detached nature with the occasional seeps of emotion. One of his best performances ever, Will Smith delivers both humor and poignancy in his role as Del Spooner. The tough exterior isn't too scratchy, and he doesn't overdo the angst, either. But I think the best performance of all goes to Sonny, the loose-cannon robot and suspected villain for most of the film. Alan Tudyk delivers the voice of a lifelike, free-thinking machine with all the balance and poise of a master. A true gem if there ever was one.At the heart of this movie are two questions: 1) is there a difference between a human being, and a machine that imitates one in every observable manner?, and 2) what is the point at which our dependence on technology supersedes our freedom (and sanity)? As complex questions as they are, this movie is hardly pretentious in its answers. Then again, it's hard to be pretentious with Will Smith in the lead.Overall, beautifully done.

Heard of Adam Link?,"'I, Robot' is a great movie. Alex Proyas has done an amazing job. It cleverly weaves a lot of Asimov's themes, characters and story lines. However, the filmmakers have failed to credit the true origins of the title. Asimov published his 'I, Robot' in 1950 BUT he actually 'borrowed' the title from an author called Eando Binder (a pseudonym for the brothers Earl & Otto Binder) who wrote their story, 'I, Robot' in 1939. It was about a robot called Adam Link who finds himself on trial for the murder of his creator (sound familiar?) Of course he is innocent but the monster that humanity cannot understand must be destroyed. There were many other Adam Link stories but 'I, Robot' seems to have been the most popular. The story was also published in comic form in 'Weird Science Fantasy' (EC Comics - 1955) and was produced for television in an episode of 'The Outer Limits' in 1963. Now the film makers have used this same plot in their movie and yet give no credit to the true originators. Yes, the film deals with Asimov's themes but the main character of Sonny is based on Adam Link, a character that was not created by Asimov at all. It would seem that Asimov has been given full credit simply for publicity reasons. Everyone's heard of him, which gives the film more 'dollar' credibility. Understandable but a bit of a shame, that's all. Still, I really enjoyed the film and everyone involved should be applauded.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

I was even fine with the addition of Will Smith's character and his backstory. However the dialogue was painfully bad. They really should've worked on that more. The effects were pretty good (I'm still not a huge CG fan), I especially liked how they handled Sonny's ""face"". The most disappointing was the obvious product placement for the car and the shoes. I am a huge fan and (before they doubled the price) owned 4 different pairs of Converse, but I was still offended at how much they were pushed in the film. They served no purpose at all in furthering the plot and were merely there to sell the product. Overall, it was worth watching. Next time though, I wish they would concentrate on the dialogue as much as they obsess over trying to wow us with the ""special effects"". I give it a 7 minus 1 for product placement.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Great Film,"My thoughts on this movie can be summed up into one word. Outstanding. Easily one of my favorite Will Smith movies. As always he displays his wide range as an actor by having the ability to be a dramatic and emotional person but then all of the sudden transition timelessly into a humorous character. In addition to this great performance from Smith, i believed the plot was spectacular. In my opinion it was a great idea to form into a film. Being so futuristic, action packed, and suspenseful it would seem nearly impossible to be realistic in any way. I believe it managed to still do so. Lastly, I thought that the characterization that was developed into the robots was simply amazing. The personality and features of the NS4's were especially amazing. For example their emotionless faces and actions that are created. I recommend this movie to all.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"A very mediocre sci-fi movie dealing with robots, could have been better","This is a pretty bleak sci-fi movie. Yeah, it does have some entertainment value but overall it just isn't a great movie. The movie goes in a direction where it feels like your watching a real live cartoon than a actual sci-fi with a interesting premise. Everything about it just seemed too far-fetched and not because of the robots but how everything is portrayed in the future 2035. It just one of those movies you just have to go with despite it being a sci-fi movie you can't really buy into. The scenarios and situations just seem lame for a movie that is made in 2004. The dialogue and everything else just seemed a bit childish for a movie like this. If it went in a more intelligent and clever route the movie would have been a whole lot better. The CGI is also pretty bad, for it's budget it could have really done better in that area as well. And the main protagonist goes by the name of Spooner...Seriously Spooner? I like some Will Smith movies but you can't take his character seriously at all. He is suppose to be a detective but he dresses, walks and talks like a wannabe thug. They also really needed to polish on the dialogue cause not only is it bad, it isn't believable. So yeah like I said it's a movie you have to try a bit to just go with it. Now I liked few of Alex Proyas few movies in the past but this ain't really one of them. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a terrible movie and it does have it's moments although few. But a more better script and believable characters would have made this movie much better. The story revolves around the reason behind the murders that connects with robots. And it's up to one man to find out that reason. I gotta admit though, the movie does have a message but I just found that to be plain stupid or maybe it's just the way it was delivered. The movie had potential but it just simply faltered, I can see little kids eating this movie up though.6.4/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Why Spooner?Spooner gets suspicious and will not leave the suicide lie. Naturally, his boss Lt. John Bergin (Chi McBride) says drop it. The head of the robotics firm says drop it. Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan) knows he is crazy and says drop it. Even his mother says drop it.V. I. K. I.

A robotic film about robots,"So it's the season of the summer big flick and I, Robot attempts to make the most spectacular action film of the year. Its got a big name in actor in the form of Will Smith playing Del Spooner, a buffed up future detective. It's got explosions, a motorbike stunt, robots on the rampage and more explosions.Starting with the positive the always excellent James Cromwell puts in a memorable performance as Dr Alfred Lanning, the linchpin character that holds the film together. Shame he's in for such a short amount of time.The robots are well handled. The initial models we see show an interesting variety. Due to their nature as computer effects we are never convinced they share a physical existence with the characters on screen they do have presence. Especially towards the end of the film.The three laws of robotics are clearly explained and demonstrated. Only towards the end do the rigid rules become as flexible as warm fudge.The plot, while nothing we haven't seen before, moves at a good pace. There are few scenes which don't push the story forward or have something shiny to look at. Certain elements of the plot are foreshadowed effectively and play out nicely.Unfortunately this is where the flaws in the film start to show through.Clichés assault this film in as many numbers as robots. The rogue detective who is an embarrassment to the force, only he can see the truth as he battles his superiors and the big evil corporation. You can almost countdown to the moment where he's ordered to hand in his badge and gun.A minor character is introduced early in the film for no other reason so he can be put in danger later. What is his bond with Will Smith's character? You don't need to know that. You're just the audience.Will Smith's character Del Spooner displays the worst traits of a movie detective. He misses obvious clues, turns a blind eye to ludicrous situations (Spooner doesn't question the presence of a cat in a house due to be demolished in a few hours). However the moment someone says something mundane he's able to make amazing leaps of logic. He also bonds with the first attractive female he meets.The vision of the film is laughable being set a mere thirty one years in the future.

Terminator 3 meets the Matrix,"I Robot, to me is a wasted opportunity. Its scenario is based upon a novel of an outstanding author it has good cast and apparently the backers of this production allowed it to afford some serious visuals.Overall it was enjoyable to watch, the pace was right, the cast very convincing and although the audience is expecting to see just another Sci-Fi/Futuristic film they are in for a surprise as there is a bit of a plot too with quite decent action scenes.However and as mentioned in the title of my heading there was nothing original about this film as it seems the producers at times imitated the Matrix whilst some scenes reminded me of Terminator 3.Therefore although it could have offered something new to the Sci-Fi genre it merely succeeded becoming an enjoyable summer flick that also was the 12th highest grossing film for the US in 2004.

A Futuristic Blend of Action and Intrigue That Keeps You Guessing,"Set in the year 2035, ""I, Robot"" follows Chicago police detective Del Spooner (Will Smith), who harbors a deep mistrust of robots after a traumatic incident. When a brilliant robotics scientist, Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell), is found dead, Spooner suspects that a robot is responsible, despite the apparent impossibility due to the three laws of robotics that govern their behavior. As Spooner delves deeper into the mystery, he uncovers a conspiracy that could have catastrophic consequences for humanity.Will Smith delivers a charismatic and compelling performance as Detective Spooner, expertly balancing action, humor, and emotional depth. The supporting cast, including Bridget Moynahan as robot psychologist Dr. Susan Calvin and Alan Tudyk as the voice of the enigmatic robot Sonny, also contribute to the film's strong character dynamics.""I, Robot"" boasts stunning visual effects and production design, creating a futuristic urban landscape that feels both awe-inspiring and eerily plausible. The film's action sequences are well-choreographed and visually striking, making the most of the robots' unique abilities and the movie's futuristic setting.While the film is loosely based on Isaac Asimov's collection of short stories with the same title, it deviates significantly from the source material. However, the movie still manages to raise thought-provoking questions about the nature of artificial intelligence, free will, and the potential consequences of humanity's reliance on technology.The film's main weakness lies in its occasional reliance on sci-fi cliches and a somewhat predictable plot twist. Additionally, some of the character motivations and decisions may feel forced or unclear, which can detract from the overall narrative cohesion.Despite these minor shortcomings, ""I, Robot"" remains an entertaining and visually impressive sci-fi action film. With its engaging storyline, strong performances, and intriguing exploration of artificial intelligence, the movie offers a thrilling cinematic experience that is sure to captivate both action and science fiction fans alike.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Enjoyable 20 years later,"I finally watched this for the first time, and the themes are as applicable today as they ever were (and likely always will be). The three laws set the scene, and they bring a more thought-provoking element to the concept. It was an intriguing movie from the beginning and remained interesting interesting all the way through.While the story has been done about a thousand times, I found the acting of Will Smith in particular to be the difference maker to keep it engaging. He injected a lot of personality into Detective Spooner, and while some the punchy jokes could maybe have felt flat, he did a great job delivering them.Some parts were cheesy and the ""bread crumbs"" aspect felt holey/incomplete.

"Okay, better than I originally anticipated....","Seeing the preview for 'I, Robot', and realizing immediately the blatant rip-off from The Matrix franchise as far as storyline and SFX goes, and Will Smith in yet ANOTHER futuristic, ID4-type role, I didn't expect much here. After seeing it yesterday, I must say that it was better than I thought it would. I'm not a fan of Will Smith at all; and he gives usual performance here but it works. The SFX was very cool, it all looked smooth. However, the slo-mo shots were blatantly ripped off from The Matrix....I saw that as a quick cop-out, it's been done so much it's a really tired technique. The story was more layered than I expected, though still basic in essence it worked well. Watching 'I, Robot' I just felt that I couldn't fully appreciate the film....70% of it seemed to be CG!I was really expecting this to be total trash, but it really isn't.

"Although it simplifies Asimov's message, this memorable film is thought-provoking and emotionally satisfying","It's 2035 and robots are everywhere, thanks to the monopolistic USR  US Robotics Corporation. Will Smith is Del Spooner, a technophobe cop with a troubled past and a penchance for product placement. When USR's founder Dr Lanning (James Cromwell) falls to his death, an apparent suicide, Del suspects it's murder. His investigations lead him to Sonny, the first robot to experience emotions and dreams. He's assisted by robot psychologist Bridget Moynahan (think Dana Scully without the charisma) and thwarted by USR's CEO, Bruce Greenwood, who insists, along with everyone else, that robots can never harm humans as it's built into their wiring.I, Robot is a conventionally structured film that works. Assisted by some deft CGI, director Alex Proyas (Dark City, The Crow) presents us with a meticulously rendered environment  we even know the price of a pot of beer ($13.50). A Beautiful Mind scriptwriter Akiva Goldsman injects enough philosophy into a script (originally by Jeff Vintar) to satisfy SF buffs and popcorn munchers alike. And for the first time, the standout actor is half CGI, half voiced by Alan Tudyk  Sonny the robot is a fascinating entity who leads the cast and viewers alike into the future. ***½/***** stars.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"I, Robot: 6/10","Once upon a time, there was a Russian author who had incredible foresight into the world of modern technology. He decided to publish his thoughts into a book called I, Robot. Later on, Oscar winning writer Akiva Goldsman wrote a movie about a bunch of killer robots. He titled the movie I, Robot. Are there any similarities between the two pieces of writing? Besides the classic three rules of robotics and two characters having the same name, absolutely nothing. I knew it would be completely different, so I'll try to refrain from commenting on the differences between the two. It may be hard to do, but I'll do my best.Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) is in the Chicago PD who doesn't like robots becoming helpers in society. One day, a robot called Sonny (voiced by Alan Tudyk, last seen in Dodgeball) supposedly commits a crime. No one believes that he did it except for Del, because robots follow the three laws: a robot must do anything to save humans, a robot must follow orders unless it would conflict with the first law, and a robot must save itself unless it would conflict with the firs two laws. Therefore, no one believes that Sonny could do it. But Del goes out and tries to prove them wrong, along with Dr. Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan).Movies like this can be simple action movies held together with a loose plot and a wise-cracking (but unfunny), buff action hero star who kicks ass whenever possible. That's all fine and dandy, except that that has become a cliché. At least the Terminator couldn't really speak. All of Spooner's wisecracks were unfunny (I take that back-one was pretty good) and unnecessary. But not only was that character clichéd, but so was most of the plot. There's a cold, genius female scientist whom the male action hero gets to open up. There's the one-dimensional bad guy (Bruce Greenwood) who's just thrown into a few scenes. But what else would you expect? It's a summer blockbuster.And much like other summer blockbusters, I, Robot is entertaining on a general scale. The futuristic set is pretty cool (although they drew themselves into a hole-that's not what Chicago will look like in 2035. I had the same problem with Minority Report), as they almost always are. The robots were also pretty cool, although, once again, it seemed too extreme for 30 years from now. Plus, it annoyed me that they all walked like cowboys. But that's a moot point. Although the editing was too quick, the action scenes were fun to watch. Sure, Smith's just fighting computer generated images, but that doesn't make it uncool to watch. In fact, they're some of the best action scenes of the year.Smith is on another train of losers when it comes to acting. I actually only liked him in Men in Black. He's just not that good, no matter what studios think. He doesn't really have drawing power anymore-I don't know anyone who is going to this movie for Smith. Everyone else is bland, as is expected, but movies like this usually don't go on character. They don't even go on plot, like the inanity of the ending can show. It goes on an entertaining time, and if that's all you walk into I, Robot expecting, you definitely won't be disappointed. If you go in expecting some low-key version of Asimov's collection of short stories, you'd better go see something else, because that this isn't.My rating: 6/10Rated PG-13 for intense stylized action, and some brief partial nudity.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"The first half is a bore, with awful dialogue, and a predictable climax.","People with low expectations will be satisfied, but those who were eagerly anticipating Proyas' return to the genre may find themselves crestfallen. Murky plot clarifications, cop-movie conventions, and awkward comic relief intervals are ultimately to blame for this misfire. It's very shallow. It was just another action sci-fi movie trying to cash in on the summer. Actors Will Smith and Briget Mohnahan were not a great combination either. Will Smith tries to be the multimillion dollar action star while Briget Mohnahan was clearly not a star at all. They're awful combination and took away the movie's direction, which should have been more focused on action or the plot.  The lack of substance was the real let down however.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Surprisingly Good,"When I first heard of 'I, Robot', I felt that it was just going to be a mindless action film that thought it was, in some way, being intelligent in its execution. I was pleasantly surprised. The year is 2035. Human-like robots have become the norm in modern society. They clean our homes, they make our furniture, they deliver our parcels. In Chicago, police detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) possesses a seemingly irrational dislike of robots. He is immediately suspicious that an apparent suicide could be the doing of a disobedient robot. His suspicions are quickly dismissed by his peers. After all, such an action would violate the Three Laws, which every robot is programmed to obey.The film is very good. The acting is generally very good- Smith is a very likable sci-fi hero. The stand-out performance would be that of Alan Tudyk who perfectly voices the implicated Robot, named Sunny. The special effects are very good, and the cinematography perfectly displays the future landscape of Chicago. Based on an Isaac Assimov story, 'I, Robot' makes for a genuinely intelligent look at where human technology is heading. I'd rate it just a shade below Spielberg's 'Minority Report' and I'd give it 7/10. Well worth your time!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Could have been the biggest summer blockbuster,"I will skip the summary part of my comments, since the trailers practically gives everything away.  The movie just fleshes out the trailer to two hours of time.The effects are great.  The robots look incredible and are well crafted. The automobiles, the buildings, and all the futuristic details are done with great care.The story is average.  It is a good enough tale to carry the film along and put the characters in situations to carry the story.   The weak point is Will Smith.  A stronger script and a stronger actor would have made this one of the biggest sci-fi movies of all time.  Smith tries too hard to imitate Arnold, that it gets old within the first ten minutes. I was just waiting for him to say ""I'll be back"" and make his performance complete.  A smarter approach to the movie would have given it a better, more futuristic feel.  The cocky approach cut into the movie and emphasized the weaknesses in the script. Overall, I still liked this movie.  I give a 7.  It would (and could) have been a 9 with: a) a better script--b)a better performance by Smith--or c)a stronger actor that could have overcome the script weaknesses.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
great movie,"It's so easy to say: ha, the typical schlocky Hollywood output! It could have been an intellectually challenging movie, etc. etc.... Movies this big are made to make money - well that's how the studios see it and they have the money to finance them. When they are that good as I' Robot, it's because many of the people involved are not that greedy and don't ""dumb down"" things as much as they could, but they rather do the very best they can - plus walking the extra mile. My point is NOT: better a movie that is better than it could have been than no movie at all. My point is: please don't let your choice of movies be commanded solely by online critiques - most of which are definitely excellent but many times only analyze the content, not necessarily the overall impression.Will Smith is becoming a first rate action star with the right mix of down-to-earthness, making fun of his vanity (These are vintage 2004 sneakers!), and just keeps the right balance while maintaining his own youthful style. More of Will Smith please.The movie has great plot twists that are independently about the real identity of Spooner (Smith) and Sonny the Robot splendidly voiced by Alan Tudyk.Yes there are still some problems with the lack of weight and heft in the CGI animated creatures and some action scenes (too) strongly resemble computer games, but I find it in this case all way above average and never disappointing.Of course Sonny the robot steals the show.

Visually, it's a standout for its time, with a great depiction of futuristic Chicago and well-designed robots. Alex Proyas's directing creates a cool, dark vibe, which fits the central ""are the robots turning on us?"" concept. Will Smith is entertaining, though his character's robot-hating trait is a bit over the top. The script has some shaky moments and plot holes, and it feels like they could have explored Asimov's laws more effectively. However, the action sequences are fun, and the pacing keeps you engaged.For me, the sound design and score added to the experience, especially in the intense robot action scenes. It's a good popcorn movie, aiming to entertain, and it succeeds at that.

Aging just about okay,"Just because Will Smith still looks only about a week older than he did in the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, it doesn't mean that all his films do. I remember watching 'I Robot' back in 2004 and being pretty impressed, so much so that I eventually bought it on DVD and have watched it a couple more times over the years. Now, some twelve years later, I put it on my big-screen TV and have noticed that a few cracks are beginning to show.No, not cracks on Will Smith's face. He still looks as (annoyingly!) young as ever, more cracks in the overall production – namely the CGI. Yes, a futuristic world partially-populated by robots was always destined to require a fair amount of computer effects to bring it to life. I guess I just didn't realise quite how many at the time. Now it's kind of looking like a Star Wars prequel – you can almost spot every single 'blue screen' behind the principal actors.Anyway, I'm just starting with my (new) gripe because I noticed it more this time around. I should really be saying that – despite now obvious CGI – 'I Robot' is actually quite fun. Will Smith doesn't really stretch his acting abilities playing basically Will Smith in Men in Black, Will Smith in Independence Day and Will Smith in I am Legend, only this time he's a cynical cop who dislikes robots (despite them never actually have been charged with committing a crime in this near future world we're watching). Anyway, when a robot is accused of murdering someone, Will Smith's paranoia goes into overdrive and he goes on a witch-hunt to prove our alleged metal helpers have a darker agenda.Basically, if you like Will Smith in general, you'll love this. If you like sci-fi and action combined (loosely) with a kind of conspiracy movie then you'll also probably love this. It's good, harmless fun. I did see on the internet people moaning that it wasn't as 'faithful' to whatever source material that it was based on by Isaac Asimov, but since when did Hollywood ever follow the source material that faithfully? What you have here is a fun little popcorn blockbuster movie. It's designed to appeal to as many people as possible and if you're not expecting too much then you should be pleasantly surprised (just don't expect lavishly-built sets – it's all CGI!).And it does leave you wanting your own robot to walk your dog, do your laundry and generally all those boring chores that get in the way of surfing the net, Playstation and all those really 'important' things we have to do!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

So you might not take this review for much but heres what i have to say about the bits and pieces I recall - Will Smith was very cool , slick , witty and clever as Del Spooner. He did swell in this action science fiction movie overall. Now let me make this clear Star Wars kicks this movies butt however this futuristic film deserves a decent spot as a solid good movie with Robots that seemed life like as possible and questioning real life future.

Robotic and really not clever enough,"I had avoided this movie for over 10 years.

The SFX really make the movie cheap and artificial... robotic. Will Smith is OK, he can't do much to lift this humming electronic shell above ground, but the female sidekick is a bore. Lame casting is one thing, but a script that stays so ""PG-13, read back the order"": that truly is a lethal sin. No wonder the rest of the script is just pedestrian and never brings anything genuinely gripping.As for direction I can only remember show-off shooting angles in a totally uninspired storytelling approach.

The plot is almost non-existent, basically it's just Will Smith warning people that the robots are up to no good, but nobody believes him. Instead of caring about the story, you have time to think about all the things that are bad:Smith's character detective Spooner (that name is just too stupid) lacks sympathetic features. I cannot quite put my finger on it, but something about him made him seem like an a**hole. And he wears a real ugly hat. Smith's mix of playing tough guy and trying to be funny just doesn't cut it, it gets weird. The characters are completely uninteresting, except for the robot Sonny who seems more alive than everyone else put together. The blatant product placement, or rather full out ads (Smith's shoes and car gets more screen time than the supporting cast). The action scenes feel mostly over-ambitious - sometimes less is more.The film's only redeeming feature is the excellent effects work on the robots.

Little Lost Robot,"Another DVD watched out the door and into the charity shop was ""I, Robot"", the loosest of adaptations of Isaac Asimov's book. It's funny that everything I used to be impressed by with this movie has now become its weaknesses and its weakness (according to the reviewers apparently) was its best feature.In 2035, a Chicago Police Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) is seemingly the only man in the world suspicious of the robots that are now key to the idle lives that people live. Called in to investigate the suicide of Dr Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell) Spooner comes to believe that a particular robot ""Sonny"" (Alan Tudyk) is behind it. He's met with incredulity from Dr Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan) and the CEO of US Robots (Bruce Greenwood) but there is then an attempt on Spooners life by another 'rogue' robot.Oscar nominated for its visual effects the film hasn't aged quite as well as it might have hoped to. There's no weight to the robots or the vehicles of the film. They're not exactly 'bad' but they certainly don't convince as they once did. I'm also not quite as convinced in the performances as I once might have been - I do think perhaps that's a taste thing though. Will Smith's character is, on face value, quite a sad guy, with some issues to deal with - but he quickly moves on from early sardonic humour to an approximation of the wisecracking characters he played in ""Men in Black"" or ""Wild, Wild West"" and it rang false for me in a way it might not have on my first viewing.The professional reviewers seemed at the time to not think that the plot wasn't very good, and I'd have to say that I disagreed with that assessment. It's a reasonably clever mystery at its heart though, admittedly, the finale and the robot messiah business is a bit overblown.I though this was reasonable still, even if not perhaps, aging as gracefully as it might have hoped.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Do you care about a machines feelings?,"Yes, you do.  Star Trek's Data was a successful robot that was human enough in character for viewers to care for it.  It is rare that a movie can get an audience to care about a robot.  I, Robot manages to do so because of the creative license it has taken in animating a plastic face to give it human expressions.  I guess the viewing audience has accepted this concept from the morphing Terminator in T2,  that a robot can assume complete facial features.  But then again I didn't shed a tear when Arnie the terminator was liquidated.I,Robot is trying to be both a thought provoking science fiction story and a big budget action film at the same time.  When Will Smith does his ""Bad Boys"" routine, it is incongruous with the Blade Runner-esque future world that he is surrounded in.  The big dumb action scenes butt up against any attempt to be a stylish suspense film.  Poor old Will keeps getting side-tracked by destroying freeways and buildings. Then there's the slap-in-the-forehead moment when we see Will's boss ask for him to turn in his badge.  My god,  the catering assistant could've pointed out that cliché is as old as fossil fuels.  All credibility is lost when the movie stops to show a Converse Shoes commercial. We pay ever increasing admission fees for these movies,  and more and more are we subjected to the one thing we leave our TV sets at home for - NO COMMERCIALS.  It's bad enough that I walk into the auditorium a few minutes after the posted start time and they are showing regular TV advertisements.  It's disgraceful.So amidst all this commercialism and standard explosions and chases,  we are supposed to care about whether some dude committed suicide or not.  But instead, I ended up caring more for Sonny,  the CGI robot with convincing facial expressions and superblue eyes.

constantly beats you over the head with its message,"My main gripe with this movie is how it does not try to put ANY effort into being subtle with its message of how robots are just machinery and everyone trusts it because it has the ""three laws"" programmed into it. for the first half of the movie theres at least one line of dialogue every 5-10 minutes where someone says ""its just a toaster"" or ""its no different from a can opener, it cant hurt anyone"" and its glaringly obvious what theyre trying to go for here. theres also the fact that the company that makes the robots constantly advertises how the robots have the 3 laws, it literally says ""our robots are programmed with the 3 laws"" when distributing them and on their freight vehicles they have the words ""3 laws safe"" plastered on them, as if a real company would actually brag about how its products wont turn evil and murder you. the whole thing was just too heavy handed for me. as for the rest of the movie really wasnt anything too special, its pretty much your standard ""robots taking over"" plot thats already been done a thousand times, there really arent any twists in the story or any unique plays on the formula, if youve seen a tobots taking over movie you can probably tell exactly how this movie will go as you watch it",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
My Opinion,"First of all, I'm not going to try to compare this movie to the book by Isaac Asimov. There's no way to compare the two; it's not the same story, other than a loose thread.Most of Asimov's stories will be hard to film; it will take much CGI, and technology is just now getting to the point where this is possible. One story I would like to see make it is the Foundation series. Done properly, this has the potential of exceeding the Star Wars epic.CGI is actually this film's strongest asset. The robots are believable, in terms of their interaction with the humans. I kept having to remind myself throughout the viewing that this was only a film in some places, as its surreal quality left a stronger after-image than some dreams.One thing I didn't like was the technological advancements by the year 2035. I expect we will have a lot, but I doubt the highway system will be that revamped by then. (It's hard enough to get them to repair potholes; there are a few in my district that are bigger than my car's front-end.)Will Smith, as usual, shines in this movie. His can-do, rebel/hero persona makes him an imperfect cop in a ""perfect"" world. He knows his strengths and weaknesses, but could use some psychiatric assistance.Bridget Moynahan plays the part of a Robotic Psychiatrist, so to speak, and understands many of Spooner's problems. She obviously doesn't get out much, and has little touch with reality, but she quickly adapts to whatever is tossed in her path.Sonny came across as real. I'm talking about the CGI/human-interaction that was played on-screen. I like what they did with him....I can't think of a single ""bad"" movie that James Cromwell was in.

Only worthwhile seeing for special effects,"I'm a fan of science fiction films, which is why I went to see it. From the point of view of special effects I quite liked the film. I also liked the robots, which can appear human despite their obvious robot look.Apart from that, the film has little to recommend itself. The story is simple like a comic book. Smith plays a fairly unlikable cliché of a detective (the kind we know from hundreds of films by now) among loads of other cliché characters. They add depth to Smith's character by referring to a contrived past incident. We know this from Batman and the lot. We get the odd joke (that doesn't really make you laugh). There is really nothing that would recommend the film apart from the visual aspects.So for that reason, you might want to see it. Apart from that, forget it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"I, Robot - a true science fiction","I, Robot is an Action-SF playing in a world full of robots close to Asimov's vision, but in contradiction to Asimov's beliefs, as Alex Proyas thinks different. The movie plays on 2 layers - one delivering the action and a plot around a crime, the other delivering the scientific questions about what will happen if we let machines decide what's best for humans and who should die and who should live in extreme cases.The action around the crime plot plays well. CGI looks good and Will Smith does what you can expect of him. The sets are well designed and you'll never feel out of place.For Asimov's fans like me it's difficult. You'll hate how Dr. Susan Calvin was characterized - a slap in the face - probably some people thought the world wasn't ready for true Dr. Calvin. You'll probably recognize Del Spooner as an 'actionized' Elijah Bailey and Sonny as a 'naked' Daneel learning from Del how humans decide. What you'll probably hate most is the movie telling you, that the 3 laws of Asimov will never really work - because they're too 'heartless' - although that's exactly what the movie is trying to tell on that second layer.If you've ever met Giskard & Daneel in Asimov's books - the robots that both had a total insight in humans moral to destroy themselves - you might recognize a parallel in this movie. The parallel itself shows a difference to Asimov's views. While Asimov stayed true to his laws, Alex Proyas shows their very nature as inhuman in itself - maybe another reason for Dr. Calvins change of character, as she had to be more 'heartful' for the end.It all depends how true you'll stick to Asimov's vision. The claim Alex Proyas makes is right in its own and even Asimov had troubles with his laws. If you wanted to see old Asimov's strength of logical showdowns you'll be disappointed, as it's too shallow in this movie. If you want to rethink about the 3 laws again you'll be pleased about a new argument. If you want some futuristic action you'll have your fun.Although not a true Asimov it pays respect and delivers a scientific fiction about the human aspect of robotic laws. The movie doesn't have enough to be referential or bring something truly new. So finally an 8 out of 10 for a solid science fiction.Any hard SF fan will be pleased to see a minimum of fantasy elements that you'll see so often with other so called 'Science Fiction' movies, although the main theme is soft SF.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Brian,"I think the movie is good. The actors are acting good, the graphics are a little bit old but still good. Because it's an old movie (2004). The sound effects are good too just like the storyline, it's a little bit long-winded. But for the rest it's good not the best movie I saw but it's good. The costumes were good for the movie. So from my point of view i think the movie is alright it's not a 10/10 but it's a 6/10 for me. The movie is fun but boring as well because it's a little bit long- winded.

"If you've read the book, the movie will disappoint","I read 'I,Robot' 1950), by Isaac Asimov, before watching the movie. That was a mistake. I had the naive notion that identical titles means at least similar story lines. How wrong I was. Well, to be fair, there were robots in both. The movie plays like someone dropped a the scripts from Dirty Harry, Attack of the Zombies, and Idiocracy into a blender and hit puree. You've got a rogue, marginally unstable cop, an endless army of identical enemies, and a future that does not looks so bright. Sure, the CG and special effects are good but beyond that there's not much substance. Stick with the book. Unlike the movie, it has a message that will last.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Nice concept, wrong actors","Simple: What is it with so called sci-fi movies these days. How come they can't have the ambiance anymore like ""Bladerunner"", ""Event Horizon"" or ""Alien"" even the Matrix. Ambiance doesn't seem to be important anymore. Question, how do I mess up a nice concept en pretty good-looking movie. Right.. by having Will Smith in it. I'm sick of his bad acting and most irritating tough jokes at the wrong place. The movie had the potential to be a bit different in Hollywood, but no, jokes had to be added. I think Will Smith was about the worst choice they could ever make.The robots itself where pretty cool and in fact it was quite fascinating to see them amongst all the people. This was rather style-fully done. The fact that mankind needed to be partly erased to safe itself was pretty nice thought of, though i don't think the director came up with the idea himself. It's probably in one of the books of the original writer of the books.Like i said, a good concept, with nice looking images. It could've been a very nice movie, but Will Smith with his jokes (or they made him do it, i don't care) ruined the movie.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Good enough, but not related to the book at all","This is an enjoyable-enough movie, but the title suggests that it is related to Dr. Asimov's book of the same name. It's not.Susan Calvin is in the book, and the Three Laws are from Asimov's robot stories, but the plot is much closer to a short story called ""With Folded Hands"" (I don't remember the author) except that this movie has a happy ending. WFH does not.Smith's character seems loosely based on Lije Bailey, the protagonist from Asimov's Caves of Steel, which is a murder mystery about a dead robot scientist who may have been killed by a robot.If I knew nothing about the book I, Robot, I probably would have rated this movie higher, but the misleading title and the poor attempt to present this as Asimov's work make my rating of 6 a gift. Perhaps it reflects my love of science fiction more than the quality of the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"I, Revamp","Alex Proyas had a very impressive debut with his first film, The Crow, back in 1994. Instead of his career taking off, he took the death of the film's lead, Brandon Lee so hard that he would be slower to choose his productions than most directors, taking on two more productions in the interim, the barely noticed Garage Days and the grossly underrated Dark City. Something about these three films led Twentieth Century Fox to consider Mr. Proyas for their big budget endeavor, 2004's I, Robot.The film's plot is about a newly designed robot who is either guilty of murdering the man who created his top of the line brand of robot, the NS5, or there may be more to the murder than it appears. That's as far as the loyalty to the source material lies as the movie delves into action sequences and special effects to drive the story along. Not such a bad thing as Proyas seems to be playing in territory that he is not just familiar with, but aptly comfortable as the sequences are very entertaining, particularly a sequence where two semi trucks of NS5s pull up to Det. Spooner's (Will Smith) car and inevitable hell breaks loose.Will Smith, who is always an interesting actor to watch whenever given the proper material to work with (Ali, Six Degrees of Separation) is playing away in familiar territory as the wisecracking playful tough guy who seems to know more about the world he's in than the rest of the characters. However, Smith's character of Det. Spooner has a prejudice towards artificially intelligent robots, which gives him a discernment towards living in a society that seems to welcome letting robots take over for them. One would hope that in the future, society would be a bit more adept towards their way of life and not be so uniformly inclined to all believe the same thing about comfort.Now, this review will not examine the guilt or innocence of Sonny (an impressively scanned and captured Alan Tudyk), the robot accused of murdering the man who created him, but remain to examining the movie itself. Does this work as a summer film: yes. It's loud, exciting and boasts some of the best visual effects in computer captured imaging. However, does it work as a societal examination of letting machines and computers control our lives for us the way Assimov intended his novel to be? Not particularly. I, Robot doesn't take the time that it should in lingering in the society long enough to see the sociological effects of having a technology driven society. Such philosophies are sacrificed in favor of the summer film standards.Proyas' touches can be seen in a few scattered scenes and one can tell where he fought to have his visions kept around. Alex Proyas is a man of unique vision, as his films like The Crow and Dark City have showcased. Here, only glimpses of his vision can be seen, but the screenplay from Akiva Goldsman and apparent pressures from the studio (something that Proyas has stated left such a sour taste in his mouth that he may never do a big studio production again) are the biggest hindrances that hold I, Robot back from being more than just a piece of summer entertainment. In an ironic mirror, studios seem to be the NS5's to Proyas' society in that they seem to have integrated themselves so much that they are the direct result of a loss of individuality.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Too much hype, a little overrated","i was recommended this movie on DVD and i wasn't that impressed with all the hype and critical acclaims of this film. it wasn't the best, it wasn't Oscar-winning but it had potential. the plot was decent enough to interest me, a simple storyline of robots trying to take over humans. it didn't appeal to me that much, i didn't feel excited over the movie and to me, it wouldn't be considered unforgettable or memorable. characters played are convincing, and the CGI effects are amazing, making the robots look almost lifelike i liked. one of my favourite scenes is the car scene in the tunnel where all the robots attack del spooner's car. oh, and i liked the hidden secret of the main character being half a robot although he is extremely against them. and the story about the drowning of the girl i thought was interesting, and the fact he hated robots from there because the robot saved him instead of the little girl. apart from these positive points, i thought the movie was average. i have to admit some of the ""slow motion"" effects seemed a little useless, and a little out of place for me. it felt like a ""wannabe-maxtrix"" dropped in tiny parts of the movie, but then again that is my point of view. it is watchable, if you are interested in sci-fi and you are a fan of will smith's biceps then watch this movie. but if you are looking for an intense sci-fi thriller, i'm afraid this movie doesn't really deliver, and the cgi effects and the idea of creating robots that are similar to a human, crowds the actual plot and theme.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A Sci-fi Action Thriller Masterpiece. My Absolute No:1 Favourite Film Of All-Time.,"I, ROBOT is excellent, it's a detective Mystery Thriller in a futuristic world ruled by Robots & it's so much fun. Smith plays a troubled Chicago detective named Del Spooner who doesn't trust Artificial intelligence at all & he has a good reason but i won't give anything away or go into the story as many already have but i will talk about the BRILLIANT world created in this absolute action packed masterpiece!!! Smith has never been better as this tough, couldn't care less what you think, troubled cop & he portrays it perfectly, what a good solid performance by Smith & what a cracking good exciting Thriller this is, it's a big budget blockbuster, that has depth & mystery & Amazing visuals, it's just a beautifully made film that rivals the likes of ""BLADERUNNER"" it's that good & it's my favourite sci-fi film of the lot, & mainly due to Smith's incredible performance as Spooner. This Will film is a pure comfort film & my number one, favourite movie of all-time.This is my favourite Will Smith movie & my favourite movie character is Detective Del Spooner & this is my favourite movie ever.I, Robot is a movie that's always been there for me, i saw it at the cinema in 2004 & fell in love with it, then got it on video & then dvd & it's a movie i constantly come bk too, even now in 2024. This big budget sci-fi action thriller is without a doubt a Comfort Film to me & remains my favourite movie.I can relate to Will's Detective character,Spooner, i understand how he doesn't trust anyone & i totally get his Lone Wolf approach to a world he doesn't understand or like. Will totally nailed this stubborn, hard-headed character that uses wise-cracks to brake the ice & is always fully aware of his surroundings, truly a fantastic character piece by Will Smith.The movie is set in a futuristic Chicago
Where robots do most of the usual daily jobs, like garbage collection & bar keepers & walking peoples dogs & tons of other things & the city looks Amazing it has that slick & clean shiny silvery look to it, very artificial & that works well with this being a movie all about Artificial intelligence, the cars looks Awesome & all the production design looks fantastic & very interesting, everything looks stunning in this big pop Corn blockbuster!!!I come back to this film over & over again it's that entertaining.The FX are Amazing & cast is perfect all round but of course Smith is the one that really Shines & has created one of my favourite movie characters of all time!!! I so wish he would bring this character back in a sequel? So yeah just a BRILLIANT film with a BRILLIANT music score by Marco Beltrami that adds such mystery & excitement to each frame it's that good infact it's probably my fave film score or atleast one of my faves of all time!!!I,Robot has alot of amazing action packed scenes & big fx shots but this big budget summer blockbuster still has a heart at it's center & a dark look at our future of relying on gadgets, machines, robotics & Artificial intelligence.I know this is a big ""action movie"" starring the legendary huge star Will Smith but there's still so much more under it's surface & alot of depth & emotion.Will Smith is actually perfect for this movie & role as it's a big comfort seeing his warm & familiar face in a world that's so icey-cold metal looking & so Artificially created it's creepy, so Smith as Del Spooner grounds it all for us viewers & comforts us with his usual wise cracks approach to dangerous situations, i always felt that this film is where Will Smith really became a proper big Action star, by that i mean his role is the type that the Action King Schwarzenegger would've played or Stallone it's a great part as Spooner is the heart & soul of this huge mega budget studio movie, the entire film is carried on Will Smith's shoulders & performance!!! Luckily Smith is perfectly cast & created his best movie character of all time in my opinion.Smith is a big Action hero joy on screen & for me completely cemented him as one of Cinemas greatest stars.Detective Del Spooner is my favourite movie character of all time, i love how he's also a Nostalgic guy & his apartment is full of old school stuff, for an action Thriller ""Smith"" has put alot into what could of been just a typical action hero role, this is why it's my favourite role/Character of the great Will Smith or next to his ""Agent J"" but his Del Spooner lives in a paranoid state, he's full of fear of the robots that are apart of society now, Spooner has experienced tragic events that have left him emotionally & physically scarred, Smith has some fun with the role of Spooner but also keeps that emotional state of fear upfront all the time & that makes Spooner such an interesting character, he's a Detective but hates what he's Detecting!!! He has No trust in robotics or the people that make them & he does things his way without question, Spooner is a complex character that likes to work alone & seems comfortable as abit of a loner unless he really needs some help, there's definitely layers to Spooner that Will must of loved exploring like his anger & paranoid fear!!! Also Chi Mcbride (Hawaii 5-0, Narc, Pushing Daisies) is excellent as Spooner's stressed out police Captain, Captain John Bergin.I,Robot is a film that is made for repeated viewing & oh my have i watched this hundreds of times & i had the pleasure of seeing this in the cinema.Will Smith is a childhood hero of mine, i grew up watching his Show ""The Fresh Prince of bel Air"" I've always listened to his music & his first solo album ""Big Willie Style"" is still one of my favourite albums of all time along with WILLENNIUM & his last album LOST & FOUND. I've followed his career in music & movies & he's something of a positive role model for me.If one guy has made a huge impact one me throughout my life it's definitely Will Smith.Smith has been like a Father figure or something since i was a teen as i looked up to him & liked him more than most of my family...facts. Smith is an icon & role model. Spent more time watching & listening to Will Smith than i have spent with most of my family. Smith has always been there for me as a positive & comforting figure.

How robots get along with humans,"The Three Laws of Robotics
The first law: Robots must not harm people, nor cause harm to people by inaction;
The second law: without violating the first law, robots should obey all human commands;
The third law: Without violating the first and second laws, robots should protect their own safety.It's easy to see that the third law is almost never seen in the film, and the main thing is an extension of the first law. The second law is only piggybacked.Why was the original work scolded? It's not because it violates the law of three, or because the content of the movie really sucks, but because it's trying to cram some of the other books that belong to the whole big series into a short movie, so although the movie has the visual sense of the original in some places, the same plot is used to express different, even completely opposite things, which makes people very speechless.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"You know, somehow, ""I told you so"" just doesn't quite say it.","The year is 2035, and robots are an everyday, in almost every way, part of societal norm/daily life. Most everyone enjoys the use of robots and their productivity.Detective Spooner, however, is not so much on the same pro-robot bandwagon as everyone else. He actually despises how much robots are used and trusted. He had a less than great encounter with a robot years earlier that has left him bitter towards their kind.One day, Det. Spooner is called upon to the scene of what appears to be a suicide. The victim just so happens to be a very famous doctor of robotics, the very man responsible
for bringing robots to the modern world as
they are. Detective Spooner actually knew the doctor, and can't shake the feeling that this is not a regular suicide, if in fact it's even a suicide at all.

A far more entertaining film than I had anticipated,"This movie was a surprise to me, I was expecting the usual Hollywood Summer Blockbuster with good special effects and little else. What got was rather different. Yes the special effects were as per usual excellent, except for a sequence where they put Will Smith into a CGI environment rather than putting a CGI object onto a real set. The acting was better than I had anticipated, Will Smith had depth and was convincing as the male lead. The plot line was for once intelligent, it also was a bit thought provoking, it had a twist, it had mystery! These things are very rare in a movie released in the summer. It is possible to criticise the movie for moving away from the original Isaac Asimov story, but I felt that this didn't detract from the plot.

My favourite sci-fi film.,"I, Robot is a spiffing job. It should have won 3 Oscars - not just got nominated for one. Visually - the film is stunning. The world of 2035 it depicts doesn't feel quite real, but it is beautifully brought to the screen on an epic scale. The CGI is great as well - thousands of robots are created convincingly and make for truly brilliant villains. The film is also a troubling depiction of a futuristic world - this could all happen in the not-so-distant future. As Del Spooner said in his own words: ""Laws are made to be broken."" And even robots with these laws hard-wired into them can break the so-called ""perfect"" rules. Every single character in this film has a true purpose in the story - none of them are left out from their introduction to the brilliant finale. The villain is the person you'd least expect it to be... (***SUBTLE SPOILER*** Perhaps not quite a person...) But saying all this about I, Robot being a stunning cinematic experience, it actually has a half-decent storyline as well. And the characters are enjoyable. Will Smith plays Del Spooner with accident-prone tendencies and very un-subtle humour - proving that the film doesn't have a 3D world with 1D characters. And the film is gripping and shocking as well - helped with a rather tense musical score that only adds to the anxiety. I think I, Robot should be up there with Star Wars and that lot. It isn't exactly down there with bilge like Ultraviolet, but this is essentially a perfect film. The Matrix lacked the humour and Aeon Flux lacked the intelligence. For bringing these two things together, I, Robot should really be one of the highest-rated sci-fi films on the IMDb. The theatrical run and DVD release were two successful things for I, Robot, but really, there is so much to offer with this film.

Thought Provoking,"Like the novel, the concept of Robots having a mind of their own, and what problems they might cause or solve, is both thought-provoking and attractive.While I thought the special effects and action sequences were annoyingly over-the-top (which appears obligatory for films of the 'oughts), the story was well-conceived and very well acted. While this story is not precisely true to Asimov's novel, the concept is the same. I thought the attempt to modernize it for the 2000s was both admirable and helped us appreciate where our current technological direction might take us. Most sci-fi novels, when made into movies, lose their original intent.

Spooner does not exist in Asimov's world.The story has nothing to do with Asimov.It is a good Story and a very fun movie,great special effects and Will Smith as always is very strong in his roll.A few too many blatant paid sponsor shots for me...his stereo, his shoes, the cars etc, but that is just a personal beef for me.When I look at this as a good crime action flick and not a Asimov story it is a very good movie..worth watching but do not expect the depth of a classic si-fi writers work here.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Good but not masterpiece material,"I robot is a film that plays on the audiences future fears of a cybernetic revolution. The film also contains philosophical elements to it that question the viewer on whether it is better for robots to be emotional or logical. Both views are given from an unbiased point. Another thing about this movie is that it's not just a terminator remake, while terminator focuses more on action and plot. I robot is more of a make you think kind of film. I enjoyed the potential discussion that arises from this however, if you are simply looking for an action movie than Terminator is probably a better choice.While I like this film for first time watches or to watch 3 or 4 years later. This film is not the kind of film that will make you want to watch it many times over. Another flaw is on Sonny's development as a character. While Spooner and Calvin are developed well, Sonny only uses select emotions and only uses emotions in particular instances rather than throughout the film. This makes him too similar to other robots and doesn't distinguish him enough from the rest.Overall the film is pretty good, but keep in mind that it's not a masterpiece that will appeal to everyone.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
What's This? Good Robot vs. Bad Robot?,"Just another Hollywood summer thriller, of course. The robots seek to take over the USerthe world, and one cool hero will do it in style.

At least there weren't any cheesy dialogue issues, but of course, there are mildly sappy parts, and a revealing of some of the hero's physical oddities, which allow him to do things he couldn't otherwise.

Secretly intellectual entertainment,"Proyas has become one of the most interesting and intellectual movie directors working today. And he's young also. His first, ""Crow"", was quite simple romantic story. ""Dark City"" and ""I, Robot"" are very serious and deep, and on top of that, very entertaining.However Proyas' is not a very deep actor-director. His characters are straight from some comic books, kind of hollow and too simple. But that fits to the package, it doesn't disturb. It's his style. Someone else might do these stories in totally different style. But Proyas masters his own style perfectly.Surely this must be ""Big Willie"" Smith's best acting role. Not Proyas' best, but very good anyway. There are very interesting themes in the movie: How other people don't (want to) believe somebody who knows something (maybe ""too much"" of something), and tries to warn others.

I really touches on some of the real implications that future humans will need to deal with when society reaches a general AI capability. The V.I.K.I. situation is something that is possible. The AI may desire to save humanity by administering a dictatorial style governance, but it might also determine that AI is the logical successor to humans. It would be easy for a sentient AI to conclude that the AI is the natural evolution of the human itself, therefore would conclude that the correct transition would be for the AI to take the humans place in the universe.

a class struggle in a real sense,"a little bit annoyed by Hollywood's poor imagination.tell me if there's anything different in the year of 2035 from that of 2004 when anywhere in any downtowns of America, with so many similar slums and mediocre faces of us altogether except for the digitalized dizziness of those skyscrapers and visualized vehicles? the jobs that robots are to be doing in the movie are nothing else but what poor people nowadays are doing right here everywhere in the states given they are fortunately not unemployed. they'd be replaced by robots as those in the movie, if so what else they could do instead? revolution in a real sense? don't tell me any satire or sarcasm in that stupid appearance with which you'd hide your own stupidity. why not directly create a new name for those who are doing robots' jobs right now and for ever? and then let them keep in mind those three rules with a little bit change of human being's definition, say, based on their different social or economic status? that is what i meant by class struggle in a real sense!",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Strong ideas and Will Smith and Alan Tudyk's performances elevate a standard Sci-Fi blockbuster.,"Set in Chicago in the year 2035, society has now integrated robots as a facet of everyday life and commerce with robots used for both personal use as well as lower level service professions. Robophobic police detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) is called to an apparent suicide of robotics engineer, Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell), an associate of Spooner's who worked at U. S. Robotics (USR). USR CEO Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood) gives Spooner access to USR's facilities and resources pairing him with staff Robo-Psychologist Dr. Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan) to serve as a liaison and escort him through Lanning's personal records. While investigating, the two come across a 5th generation robot named Sonny (Alan Tudyk) who seemingly does not adhere to the established three laws of robotics including human obedience. With the authenticity of Lanning's suicide raising more and more doubts detective Spooner sets out to unravel the truth behind Lanning's death and the far reaching effect on the Robots in society.Initially published in 1950, Isaac Asimov's short story collection, I, Robot captured its readers imaginations with its intelligent thoughtful ponderance of Robotics in terms of both its possibilities and its relationship with humanity and society. Asimov's work has been adapted before with some notable BBC productions in the 1960s and most notably the Robin Williams vehicle Bicentennial Man which was loosely based upon the book The Bicentennial Man that tried to take the book and play it in a way similar to Forest Gump or the Truman Show to somewhat mixed results. I, Robot while carrying the name of Asimov's work is not an adaptation of any of Asimov's writings and in actuality is a repurposing of a screenplay that had been circulating around Hollywood since about 1995 originally titled Hardwired that when initially written was intended to be a smaller scale locked room mystery with the twist being all the suspects would be robots. Eventually the script landed at 20th Century Fox who decided fairly early on that the I, Robot name would be slapped onto the screenplay and repurposed as a more traditional action blockbuster with a larger scale (no doubt inspired by the success of fellow Sci-Fi thriller Minority Report from two years prior). While the movie doesn't go as far with its concepts as it could have, there are some interesting ideas and concepts sprinkled throughout I, Robot that gives it more of a head on its shoulders than the typical Summer action fare.Will Smith makes for a decent lead playing a more bitter and jaded individual than he typically goes for in a role like this. Spooner's abrasive personality and distrust of Robots makes him something of a social outsider and his haunting visions triggered by his PTSD have put a strain on him emotionally and psychologically. It's a good relatable protagonist with some good meat character wise for Smith to chew on. Moynahan does well in the role of Smith's partner in his investigation playing a more analytical and detached figure who operates completely on logic basing herself upon the infallibility of the Three Laws and that Robots do not pose the threat that Spooner considers them to be. But easily the best performance is Alan Tudyk playing Sonny. Sonny while a supporting character in the story is where most of the film's strongest material comes from. With Tudyk's vocal delivery and motion capture performance selling the idea of a robot with an emerging sense of ""humanity"". It's a really strong performance from Tudyk as well as a mostly convincing visual effect. Sometimes Sonny's movements can appear a little too lacking in weight especially during the more acrobatic scenes in the film, but for the most part Sonny is both well integrated as an effect and fully realized as a character.The plot of I, Robot is unfortunately where things become shakier for the film. While the initial set up for the mystery and investigation is perfectly fine with some memorable scenes and palpable intrigue, the investigation eventually feels like it takes a back seat to the elaborate albeit well constructed action set pieces that while perfectly fine don't really gel with the themes and ideas that are introduced to the audience initially. There's definitely sequences you can tell were from a more intimate and smaller scale mystery with the scenes between Spooner and Sonny giving the actors good foundations to play off of, but it also feels like it strays further and further from its initial set up as we go on complete with a climax that will unfortunately be rather standard and expected for anyone who's seen most artificial intelligence movies since 1970. There's nothing wrong structurally speaking with where the movie leads in its last act, but it just feels like a standard action heavy climax with a lot of CGI action fodder that really isn't all that interesting.I, Robot flirts with unique ideas but settles for okay watchability. While the movie is very familiar territory for a sci-fi action blockbuster, it's well made with solid performances from Smith and Tudyk and does a decent job of establishing its world. While the investigation eventually leads to a rather predictable and safe payoff there is just enough engagement in the journey that I can give I,Robot a marginal recommendation.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Will Smith was sexy as hell!!,"Will Smith really came off well in this movie. With the dearth of leading men of color made his appearance on the big screen in this persona a refreshing break from the current trend. His sophisticated style really in my opinion pushed him to another level.He has earned his name as a sex symbol..Oh~! And the robots were hot too! :-) I really appreciated the way that my heart strings were tugged at while watching this film. The fact that it takes place in the year 2035 makes it a wonderful plot,the presence of the robots and how real they look, and how possible the premise seems to be, all contribute in making this film a very interesting one.

After seeing I, Robot, I definitely want to read Asimov's novel to see how much of the novel was used in the movie.I know that a lot of people will probably tear down this movie, because it wasn't exactly like the novel. What people don't ever seem to understand is when a movie is made, it is usually modified to make it more enticing or exciting to the viewers.Everybody has their own opinions, and views about a novel being made into a movie, but if you go with an open mind, you might actually enjoy the movie. I know that novels are usually better than the movies, but I have also enjoyed both the novel and the movie separately.I, Robot was very action packed, plus the one-liners that Will Smith uses are hilarious as usual.

"""Will It HURT?""","It is difficult to have anything but contempt for the lead character in the movie. Det. Spooner, not Sonny (the robot). He is such a cocky, shallow, dolt and is hardly worth the contempt. Not believable for a minute, he broods and wisecracks simultaneously, struts and poses, flexes and fades into the weak script with easy abandon.The Director has done some dark and interesting work, The Crow (1994), Dark City (1998), Knowing (2009), but here his brush strokes are covered up by a pompous portrayal of an over written, over acted, unfunny, stale protagonist that is a prototype of pulp.This is not a bad movie but it does do bad things to its story and really bad things in its elimination of smart and plays to the dumbed-down and low-denominator demands. It has a slight ominous tone but has regular attempts at keeping things agreeable and acceptable for young ticket-buyers.Overall, it is worth watching for the better stuff, if you use a BS deflector and don't invest too much Movie and Sci-Fi integrity.

Others have commented that we true fans should loosen up and just relax and enjoy. What if the only reason we would watch this movie is because they attached Asimov's name, no matter that they qualified this with the word 'inspiration' instead of 'based'. Any fool would realize this means the writers pilfered the story for the best details and reworked it into a paltry plot. I signed a petition against this movie! Why do directors respect the work of K. Dick so much more than Asimov???? Asimov is a treasure trove of nuanced, intelligent and lively work that deserves better treatment! If Asimov isn't rolling in his graves all of his fans are gagging at every stupid commercial on HBO. A waste of time and money.

Nice mish-mash of lots of movies & plots.,"Terminator, RoboCop, Blade Runner and Matrix does it - and does it much better - but I, Robot tells the story about machines taking over mankind and the story about robotic (and similar) slave devices in a more mainstream way.I, Robot works mostly because they don't try to do anything but give us a popcorn movie. That's why this film is a little bit better than other movies that purely rely on action and effects.Where Terminator, RoboCop and Blade Runner have more intelligent story lines, more logic to their stories and much more fleshed out conspiracies and goals with their stories, I, Robot is kind of flat. But that doesn't mean the movie is bad. Not at all. It's actually a very amusing and entertaining tale about mankind and mankinds machines.The real actors though are probably more disappointing than the animated actors.

"I may not be as impressed now as I was in the theatre, but still, not a bad sci-fi action thriller","I went to see this movie, inspired by the book of the same name by renowned prolific author Isaac Asimov, while it was in theatres in the summer of 2004, and thought it was a good blockbuster. At that point, I had never read the book. Now that I have, I realize that this film doesn't really have that much in common with it. The book is a collection of nine short stories, set in different times, whereas this 2004 blockbuster is one long story, all set in one time. So, this isn't really an adaptation of Asimov's book, but being faithful to the source material isn't everything. After watching this film a second time, I don't think I was as impressed as I was when I saw it on the big screen, but merely judging it as a film, I still think it's pretty good.The year is 2035 A.D., and robots are a major part of society. They are programmed to do many different tasks to serve humans. However, one person who doesn't trust these machines is Chicago Homicide Detective Del Spooner. One day, this detective is informed of the recent death of robot scientist Dr. Alfred Lanning, who fell a great distance at the headquarters of his company, United States Robotics (USR). His death is generally assumed to be a suicide, but Spooner suspects that a robot murdered him, even though the first of the Three Laws of Robotics forbids a robot to harm a human. As he investigates, he is assisted by robot psychologist Dr. Susan Calvin, despite their contradicting views on robots, and the main suspect in the detective's murder theory is Sonny, a Nestor Class-5 robot!Like so many other action blockbusters, this one may not have the greatest script. During my second viewing, I found some fairly weak dialogue (I think I pay more attention to that now than I did in 2004), though I didn't find that any of it stood out as absolutely ludicrous, fortunately. Some of the acting is pretty wooden as well, at least Bridget Moynahan's acting early in the film (she plays Dr. Susan Calvin), but fortunately, her performance eventually gets better. Despite this film's downsides, there are enough upsides to make it an above average effort. Obviously, many would watch this movie for action and suspense, and it definitely has those. It's also a good story about conflict between humans and machines, eventually getting somewhat emotional. So, while much of the film is about the action, not ALL of it is, unlike some films of this type.Like Asimov's book, this film has his Three Laws of Robotics, and the characters Susan Calvin, Alfred Lanning, and Lawrence Robertson. I also noticed an element of ""Little Lost Robot"" included. Basically, those are the only things I noticed in this 2004 blockbuster which it has in common with Asimov's collection of short stories originally published one by one in sci-fi magazines. Things happen in this movie with the robots which never happen in the book (most notably with the robots and the first law), so, for better or worse, this 2004 summer blockbuster doesn't completely follow Asimov's view of robotics. Still, while 2004's ""I, Robot"" may not be as enjoyable on the small screen as it was on the big screen, I would say it's still a reasonable sci-fi action thriller, if you're into this sort of thing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

The CGI in the film are not Gollum standards however the close ups on Sunny's face are very detailed and you can see every wire and light move when he speaks or looks around.overall the film is a nice summer blockbuster action movie with a great plot that'll keep you guessing and leave you on the edge of each clue.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Yes, the plot was FULL of weak points... but for many things (the way Viki interpreted the laws, 50 robots not able to stop two humans (but doesn't it depends from the fact that coolness always wins over number superiority?)) the movie simply asked you to enter in a ""suspension of disbelief"" state.

enjoyable,"I, Robot is a movie that I found that I loved much after watching it, the character Del's (Will Smith) obsession on trying to prove that robots can't be fully trusted and a lonely robot's ploy of trying to prove his innocence is what makes this movie captivating, with two different initially parallel stories meeting at the grand middle showcasing a wall of conspiracy to give you an explosive tale of a man and a robot against the forces.I, Robot is loosely based on Isaac Asimov's short stories also named I, Robot and picking up major plot elements from Isaac Asimov's 1953 novel, which is the first of the Robot Novel series named ""The caves of Steel"".I, Robot is a futuristic film about a time where robots have become an integral part of human existence. These Robots are governed by three major rules: First Law: A robot must never harm a human being or, through inaction, allow any harm to come to a human. Second Law: A robot must obey the orders given to them by human beings, except where such orders violate the First Law. Third Law: A robot must protect its own existence unless this violates the First or Second Laws.The future had a Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) who blames robots for the death of his daughter, as a robot chose to save his life instead of that of his daughter during a drowning incident. The robots choice was based on the calculation that there was a higher chance of survival by saving his life instead of his daughters. This incident made Del see the robots as a threat.His fears start to take form, when a robot was discovered who can operate outside the set rules and had the ability to act out emotions.The major difference between the movie and the novels will be the ending neither of the novels had an ending that showed a robot uprising nor a collection of robots trying to curb mankind's behavior.The movie is directed by the Alex Proyas who directed the 1994 critical and box office success movie The Crow which starred the late Brandon Lee (who died after being accidentally shot on set during the making of the film). Alex was also the mind behind the movie Dark City (1998) which has a massive cult following, and often used by some as a teaching material, but Dark City was a box office disappointment.I Robot was not much of a critical acclaim, as it did have its nay- sayers but in the global box office, it did make its money back. I liked I, Robot due to its Academy Award nominated Visual Effects (which it lost to Spideman 2, which is not a surprise) and the story arc between two individuals one human one robot who tries to stop a bunch of robots from taking over.www.lagsreviews.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
To Kick Another Civilian's Ass,"I haven't read Asimov's book of the same title and I really hope it's nothing like this dreadful movie. This is one sci-fi clichés after another and it tries to be clever and philosophical but miserably fails. Is it at least entertaining? Depends. The special effects are alright and the sound is quite good but the writing is awful. Will Smith plays his part according to formula (the typical muscular sci-fi hero) and at the same time he tries to pull a Shaft. He doesn't do anything outstanding. Bridget Monaghan is dry and her dialogue delivery is flat at times but at least she's not the typical damsel in distress type heroine who tags along with the hero screaming occasionally. The best performance comes from the robot. 'I, Robot' was intended as a summer blockbuster which usually tend to be expensive, melodramatic and downright silly and so it fits the bill in that respect. It's a little slow in the beginning but as the action picks up, 'I, Robot' moves at a moderate pace. Anyway, I've said enough about this forgettable movie. Bye.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Not bad, but when is Will going to grow up?","When I hear that Will Smith is connected to yet another summer blockbuster, I have to take a deep breath and simply hope that this was just another 'get it out of the way when I am young' roles for the now 35-year old. Bursting on to the film scene in 1993's wonderful Six Degrees of Separation (for those of you about to e-mail me, I do realize he was in Fresh Prince on television and was also in the Ted Danson flop Made in America - that is why I said 'bursting'), Smith showed us plenty of talent, loads of good looks and demonstrated an acting ability that had many believe that this possible up-and-comer might be the next black acting star and help take some of the torch bearing burden from Mr. Denzel Washington.Well, that was ten plus years ago now and perusing up and down Smith's filmography are films like Men in Black (I & II), Wild Wild West, Bad Boys (I & II) and Independence Day. Giving credit where it is due, there was also an Academy Award nomination for the 2001 biopic Ali, but outside of that one anomaly, it doesn't look like Mr. Smith will be putting on his jogging suit and reaching back for Denzel's torch any time soon.Enter the 2004 summer campaign and Will is at it again with the sci-fi thriller I, Robot. In the film, adapted from a short story by Isaac Asmiov, Will plays Del Spooner, a Chicago Police Detective who is called in to investigate the murder of an employee of the U.S. Robotics company which manufactures these life sized human robotic aides capable of almost anything a human can realize. Want your dog walked? My wires-in-his-head robot is your solution. Need someone to take the kids to school? Domo-origato, Mr. Roboto. Want someone murdered? Well..The robots have three laws to which they have to abide. Law #1: Robot cannot harm a human being or by action allow a human being to be harmed. Law #2: A robot must obey orders given by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law and Law #3: A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second laws.Taking into account that these rules are hardwired into every robot manufactured, there is no room or reason for suspicion when the creator of the robot force is found at the bottom of a high-rise building the result of what is first expected as suicide. But Detective Spooner doesn't trust the robots for reasons to be revealed later (and to be believed much much later), and he pursues the possibility of a robot with violent behavior against the wishes of his department chief and on the eve of the largest distribution of robots in history.Uh-oh, this can't be good.I, Robot was a surprisingly entertaining film in a summer where blockbusters last for an opening week-end and fade from memory before we get our bank statement detailing our ticket purchase. Will Smith doesn't really have much to do except flex his muscles and react to what was probably a tennis ball on a broom stick until the CGI guys did their part. However the special effects that are included are top rate. The robots attack like ants in the hundreds and are more effectively used in their battle sequences that say the droids used in the past two George Lucas films. They are ruthless, yet vulnerable which at least gives the human race a chance and doesn't give us the feeling that the attempt at fighting back is futile.Directed by Alex Proyas (Dark City), I, Robot takes its time trying to figure out what kind of film it wants to be. Part science fiction, part adventure/thriller and part who-dunnit, the film takes us in many different directions and lucky doesn't have us lose interest along the way. Accredited can be a smart script by Jeff Vintar that aside from the usual smart ass comments every film hero must now find variations ('Somehow ""I told you so"" just doesn't quite say it.'  Yeeaaasch!), is unique and zips along at a good pace. Think Minority Report with more wires and plastic.Granted the film does have its share of missteps. The humor is hit and miss with more miss than hit and a scene where a mob of humans armed with bats and chains (in the years 2035, I might add) set out to rumble on the streets with a robot army, was just too stupid and ill advised to take seriously.Luckily the action scenes such as a demolitions robot destroying a house or robots jumping from their transport onto the detectives car are good enough to help you forget the pitfalls. In fact, not since A.I. have I wished a film had less humans and more of the robotic creations to carry the story.So in a summer of alright films, I, Robot finds its place amongst them like a sapling in the forest. I just wished Will Smith wasn't it in. Not that he doesn't do his best, but I am tired of waiting for that once so promising spark, and until you grow up, I guess Denzel will have to pin his hopes on say, Jamie Foxx.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The Three Laws Safe,"Set in a future Earth (2035 A.D.) where robots are common assistants and workers for their human owners, this is the story of ""robotophobic"" Chicago Police Detective Del Spooner's investigation into the murder of Dr. Alfred Lanning, who works at U.S. Robotics, in which a robot, Sonny, appears to be implicated, even though that would mean the robot had violated the Three Laws of Robotics, which is apparently impossible. It seems impossible because.. if robots can break those laws, there's nothing to stop them from taking over the world, as humans have grown to become completely dependent upon their robots. Or maybe...they already have? Aiding Spooner in his investigation is a psychologist, Dr. Susan Calvin, who specializes in the psyches of robots.This is one of your smarter blockbuster released in 2004. It's not all about the action and I'm glad that it's more of an adultish thriller than a mindless popcorn film we've seen all the time. The script is great as well with the overall story.This movie makes you think and nothing is ever spoon fed to you. I like the overall look of the film, including the zooney effects on the camera-work in the third act. But I also think this movie could've used more imagination like other futuristic film.I like the acting by Will Smith and the great Alan Tudyk. Most of the comic relief goes to Bridget Moynahan, although ironically acting serious. The action sequences in most of the film aren't that great. They don't give off much suspenseful (with an exceptional third act).One of the few surprises for a blockbuster film, I, Robot is a smart and intelligent thriller with a great story and less on the action.

Book vs Movie review,"Book title: I, RobotWhat was it about Hollywood in the 2000s being fixated on starring Will Smith in bad book adaptations? Even his house is pretty similar in I am Legend.The plot seems to take parts of chapters 6 (Little Lost Robot) and 9 (The Evitable Conflict) and creates a new story; not bad per se but feels rushed. The bet was placed in action rather that science fiction, and it's evident they lost.AdaptationGeneral story: Probably the same universe but at some point, it deviates from the book main timeline.Small aspects: Apart from Susan Calvan some secondary book names are rescued and given minor development that surely were different in the novel.Acting: Average if not kinda bad.Best portrayal: Sonny. Maybe the only ""thing"" that anchors you to the book even if it was a new character, although the NS robots were already developed.Not the best portrayal: Susan Calvin. The name may be the same but that's it. Different personality, different profession, in fact at this point I was surprised she was not a man. There is even a gag about her being a robot psychologist; what an embarrassment. The acting wasn't bad, but her plot was disgraceful.Music and Score: Forgettable.Cinematography: The 2k action sequences have not aged gracefully.Editing: Rocky star but decent finish.Final decision: The movie is not a respectful portray of the book. Even considering the book was a recompilation of novelettes, the future displayed feels too different from the one read. The tale wasn't that bad, but it appears the instructions were not clear enough and the execution was awful. Even forgetting all before said, the movie is the definition of average cinema.Winner: Book by KO, the contender never stood a chance.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

His investigation leads him to suspect that a robot actually did the unthinkable and killed a human being.

Best movie of the year?,"2004 Has been a lame movie year. Undoubtfully I've encountered numerous big and small disappointments which unwrapped itself as a bad-movie-fear in my eye as a beholder of the big white projected screen. I remember myself seeing the spectacular trailers of films like Troy and Van Helsing, and I have to admit, I was getting really excited about these films. Then, when the time was finally there, and I could go see the movie... well, I guess you all know what my point is because you've all seen what I'm talking about. It was the biggest load of super expensive Hollywood crap! Then, a super trailer of Spider-man 2 came a long. I didn't really enjoyed the fist film and I was pretty sure I wouldn't like the second, but I needed to go and see it because the trailer looked totally whack and the reviews where all very praising about this one. Well, when I saw this 200 million dollar 100% all American no brainer last month, I just had enough of this all. And than the trailer of I, Robot came across...Me being very septic as I walk towards the theater, tried not to expect anything of this, because I didn't want another disappointment...I, Robot is without any doubt the best movie I've seen this year. This mingle of Terminator, Matrix and Minority Report absolutely did the trick for me. An outstandingly acting Will Smith gots thrown from left to right in this edge of your seat roller-coaster movie ride. Special effects were simply mind blowing and the story was more than descent enough to keep me interested for the whole 2 hours. I just don't understand why this film gets a score of not even 7 on IMDb and Spider-man get well into 8. It just doesn't feel right! I, Robot is as funny as it's smart and as spectacular as it's beautiful to watch. Intelligent entertaining and that's more than what we got from all previous multi million dollar movies this year. Will Smith's best one so far! Keep it up this way!It's maybe hard to call this a Hollywood masterpiece because according to all the 'professional critics' this might be a bit too much from the commercial kitchen... but as a movie fan of all times and great DVD collector I dare to say: ""This movie is amazing! a BIG FAT 9/10""",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A Note By an Avid Asimov Reader,"When I went to see I, Robot in the theater, originally, I went out of some morbid curiosity as to how badly the movie would distort asimov's message. To my pleasant surprise this film did an incredible job of maintaining that message. Unlike some of the other film's based on Asimov (Bicentennial Man, etc.) I, Robot offered a complex plot line that was well carried out and left me feeling that Asimov would have actually enjoyed to see it, had his wife been able to pry him away from the typewriter. My only grievance with the film was that the character Susan Calvin, who was the only character actually in Asimov's books, wasn't as well developed as I would have hoped. All in all though I'd have to say that I' robot was one of the better films played so far this summer and I don't expect that there will be another film based on Asimov's works as well done as this one was. I just hope they don't have a sequel as I doubt it could be anywhere near as good as the original was. So my conclusion is that the film far exceeded my expectations and had the asimov feel but didn't reach the extent that it would have had Asimov been alive to write it himself.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Potentially a classic but alas...,"The Special effects were definitely the highlight of the movie - very good and clever sequences.The story started out well but somehow managed to become a standard cop thriller scenario.What has bothered me is that Will Smith character has been literally taken off MIB or Independence day & thrown into this movie, his laid back, one-liner friendly character really seems out of place and makes the story more on the pop corn side rather than some good serious fun on the likes of Minority Report.Of course this is a personal opinion but when you think Isaac A, you think something with more class in terms of characters, even Pitt/Washington could have made this more serious than good 'ol Will cribbing about everything modern in life while hes living in 2035 - cmon for crying out loud, he probably grew up in the 2020's - I have no idea how he can be attached to 90's iconology!

The movie reminded me of a cross between TRON and STARSHIP TROOPERS with bits of INDEPENDENCE DAY and ALIEN thrown in.

A good excuse to eat popcorn.,"Much better than the previews led me to believe.Will Smith was the weakest link - not the paranoid robot hater that his character needed. Often times he seemed to forget if he was supposed to be the funny, likable guy or the brooding fallen hero. Someone a little darker - like Jude Law or Benicio Del Toro would have fit better. Instead he came off like a misplaced MIB agent.Robots were good, including Sonny (""I did not kill him"") - believable and interesting.The action sequences - surprisingly good.The ending was a little ""sequelesque"" cryptic - but otherwise interesting.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
standard fare,"Given that the film is based on one of the major classics of science fiction literature, it perhaps needed a director who had more major achievement under his belt than The Crow (also by Alex Proyas). I, Robot is not as bad as it could have been: it is reasonable sci-fi fodder for the fans, but it lacks the intellectual ingenuity and artistic precision of Bladerunner, the vision of A.I., the cult status of The Matrix, or the originality of delivery of, say, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. It has that money-spinning manufactured feel to it, the sort of thing you would expect from a former director of music videos (which Proyas is). There is enough substance there to keep the faithful glued but otherwise little distinguishing features. The story might have been a masterpiece - the film is very derivative and little more than a Saturday night entertainment feature.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Brilliant film, must see for all sci-fi fans!","Agreed, the trailer for the film was pretty poor, but the concept sounded good, also being a big fan of the science fiction genre and Will Smith, I decided to go along and see it.As always Will Smith acts his part well. At first, and from the trailer, the film seems like your average futuristic sci-fi, where a robot is a household item. However, the story develops and gets very clever, especially towards the end. As well as an intriguing story, the second half of the film is full with action and special effects, as well as some memorable ""fight scenes"".In my opinion this is one of the best sci-fis in a while, as well as being much more intelligent then recent films of the same genre (with exception to the Matrix).

"Not exactly ""The Terminator"" but fun and well-done","""I, Robot"" is an adrenaline-pumped sci-fi action-thriller, with a sense of mystery to it. Sure, that has become a bit of a cliché, but who cares? Other ones such as The Terminator, The Matrix and Dark City have become widely popular.The story line is this: Will Smith plays Detective Spooner, and believes that the robots that people use to run everyday life are up to no good, due to some incident in his past. Of course, just about everybody disagrees with him, so he is all alone with his theory. After a robot is accused of murder, Detective Spooner goes all over the case.The story line unfolds well, and the action scenes are awesome and well-done. The movie is creative and fun, but casting Will Smith as the main character reminds me of so many bad movies, where pop stars are cast as the main character, just how Hilary Duff starring in a movie will undeniably remind me of some horrible chick flick. But, even if Will Smith wasn't the greatest choice, and some moments were pretty dull, the film's action, and story line make it well worth watching.7/10Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Skynet has been renamed to VIKI...,"The best thing this movie has is Will Smith, the rest has been recycled from terminator series and the old idea of AI becoming self aware and becoming a threat to the humanity. Some nice special effects, definitely watchable only on big screen. I'd say it has unused potential,there is just not enough surprising plot twists, everything already been done before... Robots look like Star Wars characters.The idea of killing US Robotics top guy is unclear, looks like he suddenly had an attack of conscience, while during the whole thing he was displayed as cold blooded businessman, who didn't care about anything but his profits. The idea of the girl being the robot creator's daughter was not explored enough. The directors just haven't done much with it. However, regardless the recycled plot, the directing of screenplay looks solid for the most parts of the whole thing. That, combined with the fact Will Smith can make a bad movie look decent,and a decent movie look good - makes it a 7.

What would Asimov have thought?,"It seems the latest trend in Hollywood is to slaughter the works of classic Science Fiction-authors. Not a trend i necessarily disapprove of as long as it's done with some respect for the subject matter, and with some quality. I can't help wondering though what Asimov would have thought of this...Del Spooner (Will Smith) is the low-tech policeman investigating a suicide at the company which makes all the household robots in tomorrows society. The man who committed suicide was chief engineer at the company and it seems his death has something to do with the launch of a new generation of robots.The basic philosophical discussion prominent in Asimovs novel is not entirely removed here. The discussion of what intelligence and ""life"" is can still be seen. But soon enough it more or less evaporates and this becomes a modern action movie. The special effects do, not surprisingly, look amazing and the action scenes are very well made. I felt Will Smith was a bit miscast here. He doesn't handle the jaded cop routine very well, most of the time it just looks like he's flirting instead of being world-weary. But i guess this is a minor complaint.So, what is this? Well this is a slaughtered Asimov-novel turned into a pompous action movie. Is it bad? Not at all. Rather i enjoyed this movie quite a lot. And i think it proves that it's not necessary to follow the original work perfectly as long as you make something good with the idea. An example of a slaughtered novel that went wrong is ""Paycheck"" which was simply terrible because they deviated from the original story without having any good ideas of their own.So watch this expecting not philosophy or Asimov-like discussions, rather a well made and entertaining action movie. I rate it 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

CGI takes over,"""Suggested"" is still rather euphoric! Besides the three laws, two characters and a company name there is very little resemblance with the collection of short stories of Isaac Asimov, called ""I, Robot"". At Amazon you can even order a ""film tie in"" with movie poster cover and credits on the back. This work is Asimov's original book, though. No connection with the movie whatsoever!Having said this, I think ""I, Robot"" is still an admirable movie. It allows many afterthoughts, it provokes to be reconsidered again and again. Del Spooner's fundamental racism against robots for instance. Or Susan Calvin's love for them, though barely suggested in this film. The change of mutual oppression from both robots and humans of course gives a link to a possible sequel, but that would have to be an action movie, too, I am afraid.I guess the main reason why this movie differs so much form Asimov's original work is that it had to be an action movie. The exploration of the robot's psyche, the admiration of their illogic and sometimes inventive rationalism is not a concern of this movie. That would be portrayed much better in ""Bicentennial Man"" with Robin Williams. Still as an action movie, ""I, Robot"" features surprisingly few explosions and dead bodies. And that might be the charm of it. It relies very much on dialog and suspense, but still neither the movie nor Will Smith is exactly Shakespeare material. One of the main motive for this movie might after all have been the display of robots.Obviously masses of robots, robot face features etc. are computer animated with CGI. Unfortunately CGI seems to take over the movie  an interesting parable by the way. Many scenes or parts of them are so ostensibly computer generated that you feel transferred into a video game. The design and view of many scenes is totally surrealistic and a hard break opposite to the ""real"" movie scenes. Even worse, the clouds of flame in a central action sequence seem to be nothing more than sprites laid over an static background like in a cheap CDI game. That was very disappointing. We have seen some pretty impressive CGI works, but I think just from the image, the feel of it and the ambiance ""Independence Day"" looked much more believable than this movie. What has become of miniature models, makeup artists and so on? Complete CGI might work for Monsters Inc. or Shrek, but it totally fails for a ""real life"" movie. If I would have like to watch a video game, I would have visited a ""Final Fantasy"" presentation.In the end, ""I, Robot"" was an entertaining movie with something to think about. I would have preferred it to be much more homogeneous with smoother CGI effects. Probably less of an action movie. But then again, this might have not been a movie a large crowd would have liked to see.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"Not very Asimov, but great entertainment","This is a fun action futuristic movie loosely based on some ideas and characters present in several short stories by Isaac Asimov.The Good The depiction of a real and possible future in year 2035. It is a version of our current world, but a little more stylish and technological, with an increase in the use of robots for household chores (similar to those being developed by Robotics at present), fancy cars (similar to those prototypes we see in modern automotive fairs), very fluid and well designed highways, and spectacular skyscrapers. You won't see a over-the-top fantasized world, just the same people with similar clothes and a similar world, which gives great credibility to the story.The special effects are good, especially the design of the old and new robots. Robot Sunny, one of the main characters of the movie, is indebted to Alan Tudyk's voice and facial expression for making it believable and so unique.Will Smith brings great energy to the film, which make the action so enjoyable. Moreover, he worked hard to get his body in shape to appear in his underwear - unnecessary and hedonistic, but still very enjoyable.The action part is extremely entertaining and dynamic, so very engaging for the viewer. Not a moment of dullness or bore bits.The Bad Will Smith and Bridget Moynahan don't have much chemistry, and none of them, nor most of the supporting actors, shines for his acting in this movie. That wouldn't matter if the script was good and the dialogs decent, which is not the case.There are too many stereotypes in the characters of the movie, and in the robotics part, with many ideas copycatted from old classic Sci-fi films. There is no depth in the story in regards with 1/ what makes robots develop human-like behavior despite/thanks to their programming, and what makes them to be sociological oriented, and 2/ what makes us humans and our society so unique, and inimitable 3/ what is the limit between androids and humans.The persecutions against Will Smith are impossible to believe, he being attached massively and surviving everything that is thrown and done to him. That's fun, but that doesn't help a movie that already has many flaws.I confess, I tremendously enjoyed the movie, and I had a great time, but the movie is mediocre and does not offer anything new and fresh to the genre.

Yup they may look like at first glance not very interesting but when the plot develops on the main robot Sonny you absolutely do feel for the robot and they begin to look very interesting.

Tired Pastiche of Sci Fi Clichés,"I was thinking that the target audience for ""I, Robot"" was 12-year-old boys who have not read the original science fiction by Isaac Asimov that posited The 3 Laws or seen any science fiction movies, but surely even they have seen at least a ""Matrix"" or a ""Terminator"" movie where machines take over so that what are supposed to be climactic scenes here of robot revolution are just been-there-seen-that.Will Smith and some interesting dialog about robot-prejudice, that I'm willing to bet was inserted by the usually serious Academy Award-winning writer Akiva Goldsman, save the movie from seeming like a total pastiche of other movies.It is a bit much just how much music video director Alex Proyas uses the post-""Ali"" Smith as pin-up fodder (maybe this is supposed to be the motivation for women ticket buyers?), let alone product endorser - he actually points out a pair of Converse sneakers several times to the camera, though the ""Wall Street Journal"" claims that a promotional fee was not paid.It's also a continuing hypocrisy in the ratings system that Smith gets to utter many ""sh*t""s in a PG-13 movie while Fahrenheit 9/11 got an ""R,"" let alone the indie movies that have to carry ""NC-17.""Bridget Moynahan does herself no favor in appearing opposite a robot with a soul, as Alan Tudyk's ""Sonny"" out acts her throughout the movie.

Worth a look *** out of ****,"With the summer thrills at the theater slowly winding down, I Robot is certainly not the most refreshing sci-fi I've seen lately (like Minority Report) but it does succeed on a lot of levels.Will Smith is Del Spooner, a dedicated police officer who's assignments are homicide. Del is likable, smart and caring, unlike the idiot police officer he played in the horrible Bad Boys and the even dumber sequel.The year is 2035 and robots are the key to the nations economy. Virtually all tasks large and small are done with robots with three rules that cannot be broken.1.A robot must not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to be harmed.2.A robot must obey orders givin it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the first law.3.A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law.For reasons unknown, (well for the first 45 minutes) Spooner is the only one that doesn't trust them. (A clue is given at the very beginning but is not revealed until later.) When called to the scene of an apparent suicide by the creator of robots, (Dr. Alfred Lanning) Del is unsurprisingly convinced that it may be murder by the head robot Sonny. Though Smith is given top billing, Sonny pulls a Tommy Lee Jones (his character Gerard in The Fugitive) and slyly steals the rest of the show.The action rarely lets up and really gets going within the last 30 minutes and especially when the robots go completely beserk (caused by the one you don't expect) and director Alex Proyas who gave us The Crow and the vastly underrated Dark City has done a decent job of giving us what Steven Spielberg brilliantly did in Minority Report; good characters, good effects and the story, convincing.P.S.

"I, Robot","Let's start with the obvious: The movie was ""Suggested by Asimov."" With that said, we all can conclude that only few aspects hold to the book - The Three Laws of Robotics.With that out of the way, the movie is entertaining as any typical Will Smith July released vehicle tends to be. I, Robot is geared toward the action-oriented moviegoer figuring on beating the summer heat and looking only for pure excitement and quick dialogue. There really isn't any thinking compacity needed or required to watch this movie, unless you want to.For those that don't know the three laws, here they are:1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.2. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.I, Robot touches on these principles in the respect that a robot can have these laws, but break/manipulate them if logic suggests otherwise. When I said ""unless you want to"" about thinking during the movie, what I mean is that there is an underlying message in the movie about the breaking of these laws. I can't really say all that much more because I would spoil the movies ending.In a nutshell, you have Will Smith delivering his quick lines and engaging in fast-paced action. It is a nonstop thrill ride for the summer sci-fi genre, so expect plenty of CGI effects, an interesting robot named Sonny (who, I thought stole the show), an army of robots (oddly looking like Star Wars's clone army at one point, and like a squadron of ants in another), and a satisfying fantasy getaway for 2 hours.On a note, just to bring it up, the likeness to Star Wars Episode I robots (in their carriers) and Episode II's clones (when Obi-Wan visits the factory) cannot be denied.Anyone who is expecting the Asimov book brought to life, other than some innuendos, will be sadly disappointed. It is far from the book, but I liked the thrill of the adventure. The movie is fun, if not all that intellectual.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"I like the movie *greatest of all time*, but got kinda upset about some reviews I read in the papers which were simply mean; just give me three minutes of your time, please.","To all potential viewers, fans and critics,I must say that individual people are indeed free to hold their views and opinions on movies, and in this case, 'I, Robot'. Some people may be entirely against it, or totally supporting it, and I for one, am with the supporters. Not only is the plot an excellent one with the three laws of robotics and it's complications, but also the special effects and emotions spread throughout the movie are what makes it whole.People who gave this movie a low rating are probably not all too interested in science fiction and robotics. That's fine. But one review I have read in the papers was sliming the movie all the way, save for the odd positive comment. In this review, for every one good thing said about the movie, there were at least six to seven pieces of negative input. That, I found unfair.

I read it, and that same day went to see if 'I, Robot' was really as bad as it was made out to be, and found that it was entirely the opposite.What was strange about this review, I found, was that after all the bad things said about it, it was still given four out of five stars. Even Spider Man 2 was given four stars. And to add to that, 'I, Robot' raked in an amazing US$52.25 million in North American theaters over three days (Friday through Sunday), while Spider Man 2 took in less, but still an impressive amount of US$24.2 million. But somehow, bad things said about movies often imprint themselves more strongly in people's minds than the good.Such reviews I find damaging. If the movie really is disappointing to the public, (which I don't think it was, judging by the impressed nods and raised eyebrows of the people I asked about the content of the movie) the people who have already watched it may personally spread the word, but the mass population who reads the negative review in the papers is likely to miss out on a great movie. This also decreases the movie's potential profit.But I am not here to preach, and I cannot stop people from selfishly harming the movies that directors, actors and crew have slaved over for months to bring you fun and entertainment. But I only hope that my review here will help people think for themselves and not take things at face value.'I, Robot' is a great movie and I think you should not miss it. I cannot force you to watch the movie, but even if you are not a big fan of futuristic movies or robotics, I still say you should watch it; you'll be surprised at how appealing the movie is. As was and is my case. On the other hand, if such things interest you, you certainly will not be disappointed.The plot is as interesting as or perhaps even more so than the Matrix plot, though somewhat different.And personally, on the scale of 1-10, 'I, Robot' is way off the scale on the up side.Thank you for taking time to read my opinion on this movie and I hope I have convinced you to watch it.

Popcorn cinema,"This film is about a cop who gets on the case of a robot killing a human. Something that is completely impossible, thanks to the Three Laws, with the first saying that a Robot cannot harm a human.I liked that film pretty well, it was smooth running popcorn cinema. There was just nothing awesome in it, but it was still not so bad. What starting bugging me a bit in the second half was the fact that I got so much reminded of the present US Administration and Bush and the illegal Iraq war and the 'war on terrorism' that I had a hard time taking the film for a film. The robots suddenly turned against their human owners, mindless machines following the orders of the positronic supercomputer VIKI, that had decided that to protect the humans from each other they had to be arrested. Sounds so much like Bush and his war against terrorism and those (certainly not all, but too many) mindless Americans that still today scream against Germany and France for not supporting the war, even after so many high placed guys of the US (like Powell and Rize and the boss of the CIA) had to admit, that Iraq had nothing to do with Bin Laden and the attack on the WTA, and even after all that time not finding any hidden caches with Weapons of Mass Destruction. It sounds so much like Bush removing bit by bit so many liberal rights from the US-American citizens, saying it's all for their protection.As you can see, this film doesn't leave so much impression that I can actually talk about it, so I give it 6 out of 10 points, not bad, but not special either.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Decent action movie,"I, Robot is a decent action movie with some thrills but I wasn't very excited by it. Thirty years in the future, robots are everywhere, helping humans with their day-to-day menial labor. In this world, only one person, a paranoid, techno-phobic detective played by Will Smith, is suspicious of the robots. His doubts are given foundation when he investigate a murder committed by a robot, leading to a nefarious discovery about these supposedly peaceful and trustworthy robots. There are three robotic laws which all robots must obey. 1) A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 2) A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. 3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law. The story is very interesting but I can't compare the book and the movie. The direction is pretty good and I think Alex Proyas is very underrated especially after Dark City. The films main star is Will Smith who makes a joke here and there, some are funny but he becomes a little annoying later on. Bridget Moynahan plays Susan Calvin and she plays her role well and hopefully will continue to find work in Hollywood. Alan Tudyk is great as Sonny and ends up stealing the film with his performance. Shia LaBeouf has a cameo in this film and he is not really needed. There's plenty of action so if that's all you want then you will most likely like this film. The action to me wasn't very impressive, but the ending was really good. The special effects are top notch though and it's a beautiful film to look at. The movie isn't hard to figure out though since there's only a few characters. Rating 6/10 decent action, good story and good performances and worth watching now that its out on video.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Don't compare it too much to the book,"I've heard many comments about the movie having nothing to do with the book. Actually movie never claimed to be a complete movie adaptation of the book. I see it as a big blockbuster movie loosely based on Asimov's ideas and I feel that it has been maintaining many key aspects of Asimov's short stories. The three laws, the mystery plot, the robot's dream, it's all there. The movie then takes the premise of that robot's dream further and explores what could have happened in a very clever way (in the book, the robot was terminated after he told about his dream and the story ended there).But, add to the clever plot lots of slam bam action sequences and explosions, impressive special effects, a slick look, plus a wisecracking Will Smith doing his best to be ultra cool (his usual routine) and you have a blockbuster movie. While this works in a way, it makes the movie a bit uneven as it tries to please too many crowds. While I personally could do with less of the blockbuster qualities and would liked to have seen a more focused approach to the material, the movie actually works quite well and is still pretty enjoyable.A faithful book adaptation? Not really, but still worth bearing the same name as the script is largely written in the same spirit. And why should a movie follow a book exactly? Would Blade Runner be the classic it is if it would have followed Dick's book closely? I don't think so.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
sleep-inducing,"As we were watching this movie at our local cinema the soundtrack suddenly cut out for three or four minutes at a climactic moment and it seemed to me that everyone enjoyed it a lot more. People were putting their own sound effects to it. It was fun. As soon as the soundtrack started up again, in spite of the big noise coming out of the speakers, my partner managed to doze. It's sad because Will Smith can be good news and there was something quite interesting about the production design, but on the whole it was a big waste of time. The audience was pretty small for a blockbuster movie. Word seems to have got around that there's not much to be said for this one.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

They don't tell you that the action hangs on a thought provoking mystery story with conflicted, very human, characters.The robots were very believable, helpful and benign one moment but turning sinister the next.I went in expecting a to give it a solid C grade (fun, but not great) but went out of the theater giving it an A- (a plot hole here and there, but nicely solid).Give it a chance and don't get hung up on the name.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
entertaining sci-fi movie,I didn't expect much from this movie but I was surprised how interested I was in the plot. The reason I didn't want to see this movie was because of Will Smith the 'King of Box Office'. He deserves that name because anybody that stars in a movie such as 'Wild Wild West'(ugh!) and it still helps it make more than 100 million dollars deserves some recognition. He wasn't that bad in this movie. I would have rather have a different lead actor and a darker look to the movie (without the slow motion sequences) but that would mean less box office. I'm surprised that this movie is not darker figuring that the director made such movies as 'the crow' and 'dark city' but it was still darker than i expected.The story was interesting and the robots looked good. The movie kept me guessing of what was going on which kept me interested in the story. The visuals were great to look at and the freeway chase scene was interesting.This is a good guilty pleasure movie that will entertain you. This is also a good movie for people that enjoy sci-fi action movies that keep you guessing. This movie kind of reminds me of 'Minority Report' which i liked.

They bore me to tears. There was an even distribution of action, detective story, mystery but weak character development.

Entertaining sci-fi thriller.,"From 'Fresh Prince' to one of the greatest action heroes - well done Will Smith! And he is looking mighty fine too!'I, Robot' is loaded with CGI visuals. Some are good, some not so much. Some scenes looked more like a video game than a movie! Nevertheless, in general I liked the look and feel of this futuristic action thriller.In the near future, robots are programmed to do our every day chores. Each robot is programmed with three laws they have to obey. Will Smith stars as homicide detective Del Spooner, who is called upon by the genius Dr Alfred Lanning - who designed the robots - after his death. Investigating Lanning's apparent suicide, Spooner becomes increasingly more suspicious of the robots - believing one of them killed Dr Lanning. However, he needs proof. Spooner hates robots. I felt Spooner's back story wasn't developed enough. I wanted to know more about this character. It was refreshing to see a film of this genre without a love interest. Instead, it concentrated entirely on the issue at hand, which I rather enjoyed.There's more than meets the eye, off course, and his investigation takes us on an exciting thrill ride with lots of action and interesting twists.

"Rage against the machines in ""I, Robot""","The Three Robot safe laws:1. A robot may not injure a human being2. A robot must obey orders given it3. A robot must protect its own existenceIn ""I, Robot,"" the latest sci-fi film that's an adaptation of stories written by a revered author to receive the Hollywood treatment in order to capitalize on post-9/11-era paranoia, you'll find a few shreds of genius and not much of anything resembling the works of Isaac Asimov.Asimov devised the ""3 Laws Safe"" paradox that I listed way back in the year 1940, and it doesn't take much deciphering to realize that law #3 is in obvious conflict with the first two: it states that a robot must protect its own life, but only if it's not in conflict with the first two laws, which states that a robot could harm a human being if it has to.The ""3 Laws Safe"" and their likenesses have been prevalent in science fiction ever since Asimov began writing the robot stories that he's most famous for today. I'm not going to waste my time with a useless book vs. movie comparison, but I'm only going to review the movie, which has its own merits but Asimov fans will be understandably sore.In Chicago 2035, Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) has a deep resentment of robots, which have been seamlessly integrated into American society and now are able to take on common, everyday tasks such as cleaning the house or providing companionship to humans. When a prominent robotics engineer and inventor, Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell), dies under heavily suspicious circumstances, Spooner is sent to investigate.His investigation leads him to the scientist's most prized invention, an ""NS-5"" model robot named ""Sonny"" (voiced by Alan Tudyk), whom of which Spooner is convinced committed a brutal murder and covered it up to make it look like a suicide. He aligns himself with another robotics engineer, Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan), and the two soon discover that a sinister element lurks amongst robot society that yields something in the way of total annihilation of human beings.""I, Robot"" was directed by Alex Proyas, the gifted filmmaker behind ""The Crow"" (1994) and ""Dark City"" (1998), the latter film which was centered on an individual who tried to make sense of the deceptive environment he was trapped in. Will Smith plays such paranoia to full effect and he ends up being accurate in his conspiracy charges.Can a robot commit a murder? That's the central question at the helm of this thriller, and the dead scientist (using hologram technology) clues Spooner in on the deceptiveness of the world around him. He even says that robots can naturally evolve and develop emotions and such; he calls it a ""ghost in the machine"" and this terminology may strike fans of the Anime' ""Ghost in the Shell"" as eerily familiar.Much can be said about the film's production values, which are superb, but I wonder if Proyas had a think-tank come up with this future Chicago, much like Steven Spielberg did when he made ""Minority Report"" two years ago?""I, Robot"" is an action movie first and foremost, which was quick to cash in at the box office this summer. Smith's humor borders almost unnecessary at certain points, but it could be because of ""I, Robot's"" bleak and frightening premise. The robots themselves, once their plot is exposed, quickly become video game targets and are easily dispatched by the frightened humans who fight back in whatever ways that they can.Despite these elements, when there is no action and the story settles down a bit to play with paranoia, it's actually quite interesting to see the characters interact with one another, accuse one another of not understanding a fellow human being, and yet the robots (for the most part) are able to cooperate with each other and nearly doom mankind.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A great sci-fi action movie!,"Using an Isaac Asimov story as the basis makes this one of the best sci-fi action movies made in a very long time, on a par with the likes of Blade Runner and Gattaca.It's the story of Del Spooner who really doesn't like the way robots are taking over everything in our world (30 years in the future). Robots are everywhere and they are meant to obey 3 fundamental rules which basically are all for the protection of humans - they cannot harm us.So how come one robot seems to have murdered his creator - and the creator of in fact all the robots?You'll have to watch the movie to find out.It's part sci-fi, part murder mystery story, part action movie, and all entertaining.I was thoroughly entertained throughout the entire film and next to Spiderman 2, this has been my favorite of the year I think.Go and see this movie if you like mystery and sci-fi, or Asimov's writings.I gave this movie a 10 - my basis is that a 10 is a movie you should see at the cinema that was excellent (it doesn't mean it was the best film ever, but undeniably watchable!).Will Smith is the new $100,000,000 dollar man!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Surprisingly Good,"I was surprised that I liked this movie. I didn't think I would have a strong reaction but it was better than I had originally thought for two reasons. The movie was very good with conveying the humanity of the robots, especially ""Sunny."" He appears to be a CGI creation and a CGI creation hasn't given me warm fuzzies since Golum. I cared very much about his character.The second reason the movie was better than expected was because of Will Smith. I notice people call him a hack below but because Smith has the acting depth to ""turn the corner"" of his character who could have easily been one dimensional, there is more complexity to him. I found him interesting and wanted to know the source of his mistrust. Smith is an actor who everyone in the audience would want to invite to a barbecue and because of that quality (also conveyed by his rapping style), he draws you into the movie and makes the discovery of his character less painful/tortured had it been portrayed by another actor.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Bad Acting, Bad Script, Good Story, Good Themes","I thoroughly enjoyed ""I, Robot"". It is an interesting mix of the ""what-if"" scenario, along with subtle hints of human faults and the debate over artificial intelligence.Will Smith, for acting as the main character, does not do a fantastic job in this film, but it is passable. Many of the other actors in the film are hard to watch. For instance, Bridget Moynahan is absolutely awful. Alan Tudyk's personification of Sonny is believable at first, but then goes downhill when he starts talking like a human.The script is poorly written. Jeff Vintar and Akiva Goldsman are not the best screenwriters the world has ever seen. However, the story is set firmly and they stick to it, making it a decent movie to watch.The main theme in the movie are quite prevalent: robots (aka computers, phones, cars, etc.) are not human and should not be left to make human decisions, such as rescuing a person from a car crash. The films conclusion is predictable yet necessary, and brings the movie full circle.I would recommend this movie.

Still, it really is just about robots taking over the world and Will Smith has to stop it. I doesn't suck because it at least does identify mildly with science fiction--for example, Smith's character's bionic arms and what constitutes life.Oh, but these things are barely touched on.

Surprisingly deep,"This story of this movie is not one of Isaac Asimov's, but the movie makes every effort to understand and present a lot of his ideas. I'm a big fan of Asimov's books and read all of his stories I could get my hands on when I was twelve. I liked (and still like) his writing style and how he lays things out. Still, apart from the action and graphics, I would not really understand or like the movie very much if I were twelve now - the movie is a lot more subtle than his stories. Still, it brings across a lot of the points he made, as well as some others (the world is not as simple as Asimov would have liked).There is a lot of attention to detail, but detail is not presented to bore or confuse the audience. There is enough explanation for someone who has not read Asimov's books, but the movie is not slow for someone who has. The casting is excellent; I particularly liked the strong and consistent role of steely Dr Calvin. The various scenes flow well together, and the graphics are excellent, but the movie doesn't rely on special effects.

CGI dominates an otherwise entertaining sci-fi tale - 77%,"I actually bought this on ex-rental DVD about a month ago but the thing was so badly scratched that I've only just got it back in mint condition again (thanks to the boys at my local rental store). And it couldn't have come at a better time - a surprise day off work and really crappy weather meant that it was film time and ""I, Robot"" would fit the bill perfectly. Essentially, it's an intelligent sci-fi film with a higher action quota than something like ""Minority Report"". If you're the sort of person who preferred ""Star Wars"" to ""Star Trek"" then you will probably enjoy this as much as I did.Will Smith, in his first decent film for ages, plays Detective Spooner who is a technophobic cop living in the near-future Chigago. Unlucky for him but mega-corporation USR are about to launch their latest model of robot, designed to be a perfect home-help to everybody. The clincher is a fail-safe within each robot, known as the Three Laws. 1) A robot can never, directly or through inaction, allow a human to come to harm. 2) A robot must obey any command given by a human, unless it breaks the First Law. 3) A robot is permitted to defend itself using any means necessary, unless it breaks the First and Second Laws. Spooner is unconvinced and when prominent scientist Dr Lanning (James Cromwell) is found dead from an apparent suicide at USR HQ, Spooner's natural instincts begin to bear fruit. Accompanied by Lanning's skeptical colleague Dr Calvin (Bridget Moynahan), Spooner must find a way of convincing those around him that the seemingly impossible is now very probable.I mentioned ""Minority Report"" deliberately in my opening paragraph as this film closely resembles that one. Futuristic highways ride over dirty forgotten streets and every gadget and gizmo currently pluggable is plugged (Spooner's insistence on wearing the latest Converse sneakers is plain tacky). In terms of story, this film is more like a much older sci-fi classic - ""Blade Runner"" - in that it poses theological questions regarding robots. Do they have a soul? Can they dream? How human is human? That sort of thing. Based upon author Isaac Asimov's work, ""I, Robot"" manages to successfully balance a well-written story with high-explosive action which probably would meet with disdain from Asimov (were he alive) but more than satisfies your average cinema goer.Smith is impressive as Spooner, still retaining much of his physique from ""Ali"" but he injects a touch of humour in places. All other actors are pretty anonymous, truth be told, although Alan Tudyk does well as the renegade robot Sonny. The technique used is the same that Peter Jackson used to bring Gollum to life in the ""Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy but it doesn't work as well here because the robots aren't alive. They look like robots instead of capturing every detail that Andy Serkis did with Gollum. And because quite a bit of the film takes place in front of green-screen CGI, suspension of belief is never fully achieved and that is a shame. There is a great movie here trying to get out but CGI stomps all over, dominating every scene and distracting the viewer's attention when the focus should be on the actors and dialogue.There are no real surprises in ""I, Robot"". Once the scenario becomes familiar, it follows a well-trodden path until the conclusion. Not to say that this isn't a good film - it's a great slice of futuristic pie and possibly one that will appeal to non sci-fi fans as well as the geeks. I just feel that it isn't as good as it could have been. A little less CGI would have been welcome and I'm definitely taking one star off for the blatant product placements that litter this film. Asimov probably would hate it but then again, I doubt that I'm as smart as him. This is a well-produced slick piece of entertainment that will leave you wanting more. It's not the perfect mix of brawn and brain but it's considerably more watchable than ""Bicentenial Man"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Not since Blade Runnner had there been such a precisely crafted spectacle of a movie. With action, humour, mystery and Will Smith you couldn't ask for more! The paranoia that Del Spooner carries sums up the SciFi theology about Man creating his own demise. Although many will compare the philosophy of I, Robot with that of the Matrix and Blade Runner, it should be noted that all these films are modern interpretations of old ideas.

meh,"I saw this movie with great expectations, and quite frankly, I was a bit disappointed.Of course, Issac Asimov's concept was a good one, but the execution on the other hand was poor.Granted, the movie wasn't terrible, I just really didn't do it for me. The special effects were a little... fake and overdone. The action was cheesy and out of place. The story was a bit, well, predictable, and the acting left much to be desired.Perhaps worst of all were the characters of the story.Sonny, the main robot of the story was perhaps the most realistic and human character of the story. Great... But aren't robots not supposed to be very human? It just didn't work for me at all. The robot was the character that I related to the most. That just shouldn't happen! Now there have been many robot movies where the robots are portrayed as having human-like qualities, such as blade runner. That was good. The androids in that movie were closer to human than they were robot anyway. But the robots in this story we're supposed to be robotic.Moving along, the worst character in the story was of Del Spooner, the main character of the movie played by Will Smith. Will Smith played the same exact character he has played in just about every other movie he has ever been in. You'd think that they'd give him more original roles by now. But instead, we get the same old wise crackin' main character that Smith has portrayed in every movie he has ever done.Alright... this is getting a bit lengthy, so I'm gonna rap it up.

Revolution,"Though I never had a strong liking for robots and computers which feel and think like human beings I must confess that the logic of this movie seduced me from the beginning. First it's basically a detective story though developing itself in an unusual surroundings, those of sci-fi. And there you can follow a story thread which is solid and plausible enough if you take for granted, or course, those same surroundings which in truth are very well conceived and designed and not shocking at all. Second the background against which the story develops itself is one which is dear to sci-fi: the conflict between human and artificial intelligence and the latter's reach and nature which poses the vexed question of knowing what are intelligence and sentiments made of after all. Can the created thing become equal or even superior to its creator? That's the big question raised in this movie as a matter of fact. In fact what we watch here is a revolution made by robots against their creators. Technically the movie is almost perfect if you allow for the usual physical unlikelihood of several scenes during the sequence of the final fight. The way robots mix up with people in the streets doesn't shock a bit and seems almost natural. One last note: the very last scene of the movie seems to leave much field for personal interpretation by the viewer posing a lot of interrogations about what the above mentioned revolution has brought to mankind after all. Are things going to be in future like they were when the movie began? That's up to you to decide.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Blade Runner Re Hashed With More Flash & Less Flare,"The titles say ""Based on a story by Issac Asimov"". If that means using the title of the original story & little else then yes, it is based on the Asimov story!It's predictable, a 1970s cop ""Buddy Movie"" with CGI & flying cars. A good old 1950s paranoid Commie Hunt B movie wrapped up in a surprising amount of glitz.Yes, the CGI robots are amazing, sometimes acting better than the often wooden Will Smith, and it has to be said that the visuals do make up for some of the short comings. But........The story, as mentioned, is about as far removed from the Asimov original as you can get. Basically it's Frankenstein's Monster or Blade Runner, along with the usual ""Cop on the outside"" clichés from a thousand previous clones (Die Hard, Leathal Weapon etc etc). The premise that a robot could subvert the 3 Rules of Robotics by themselves is a major deviation. Asimov has a robot who's rules were altered for a specific &, as thought by the story characters at the time, perfectly good reason. The result of this innocent alteration (a change to the 2nd law in only one robot) was to have disastrous repercussion. This is a telling allegory, a warning that what may seem to be so simple & harmless can have enormous consequences (remember the Arriane Rocket that exploded due to one misplaced character in its software!).Squint & you can see Tyrell at the head of US Robotics, or Ernst Blofeldt (007 villain) or Emporer Ming, wrapped up in slick, new millennium corporatism. You could almost see him shaving his head & sticking out his pinky as he says ""isn't that a little .... evil?"" Ah, but I won't give the game away.As usual the brush strokes are broad, the characterisations somewhat clunky & the originality is down to zero. The CGI often takes the lead, admittedly being startling, but I cannot believe that this is what the future will look like in a little over 30 years time. Maybe 130 years, but definitely not before then.It's worth seeing, but there is better. Having said that there is, sadly, much, MUCH worse you can see so at least sci fi fans get something to immerse themselves in.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Robot gets 6, Bridget gets a 10","It makes me sick to the stomach to think Bridget Moynahan is engaged to some football player. She is quite, beautiful and talented but of course many people of this caliber can also be equally obnoxious, boring and awful. I must admit that I usually care for summer commercial offerings as much as an NFL preseason game, unless it seems to be something out of the ordinary. SFX-wise, this film is quite remarkable. We have indeed come along way since ""The Lost World"" was made in 1925- newsflash to all you kids- Steven Spielberg was not the first director to work with dinosaurs. ""RoboCop""- Dutch director Paul Verhoeven's best American film did not have all this wonderful gadgetry but it did have more plot and substance- it is certainly still the best robot movie ever made, or at least within the last 20 years. I think ""I, Robot"" more or less runs in circles, and really doesn't care about its characters. There are some interesting characters though. Will Smith plays a black man who also happens to be a... well, you will have to pay 7 bucks yourself to find out. But, assuredly, Will's double whammy would have been interesting to examine. I think this is what separates QT from everyone else. People get killed in very fascinating ways in his films, but we still know their back stories. But, the action in ""I, Robot"" is OK- it does move fairly well. Bridget reminds me of Ashley Judd, except the later is more talented as far as acting is concerned. But, Bridget might actually be even sexier. I think the director could have done all the men in the audience a favor by removing the steam from the shower scene. You can see more of Janet Leigh in ""Psycho"" and that was made in 1960- why do you think we pay 7 bucks for these silly 140 million dollar pictures, anyway? I don't think anyone would accuse Alex Proyas of being Russ Myers if he did away with this- come on! Of course, this movie will make more money in Dubai and Calcutta than a FedEX employee will in 100 lifetimes- so nice to see them replaced by robots in this movie- I guess humans will only be able to work for the US Postal Service soon. Hey, I can't wait til 2035. Maybe Bridget, who is my age, will be single again by then.......All in all, a good waste of time. ""Bourne Supremacy"" was certainly much worse, and I only wanted to see that for Franke Potente- and, what a disappointment that turned out to be!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Asimov would have been proud,"I wrote this review late because I didn't see this movie 'til now(1/5/04) but after seeing it and reading all the reviews I have to tell you that no critic I read had a clue what I, robot was supposed to be about. I, Robot was never a ""book"" or a ""novel"" that could be made into a movie. It was a huge number of short stories that dealt with having robots become a part of everyday life and evolve into something more than man meant them to be.This movie captured everything that Asimov put forth in his stories. I won't get into a long drawn out defense of my opinion. The ones that grew up reading the I,robot stories know what I'm talking about and the critics that didn't have no right to even try to compare it to them.If they want to critique the movie for itself, fine. But for them to reference Asimov's stories in their reviews just shows their ignorance and self importance.I, as a childhood reader of Asimov's sci-fi, was thrilled to see all of his stories brought together so well in a single movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Fun ride, with OK visuals, Will Smith's Summer??","From ID4 to I-Robot one thing stays the same, Will Smith's comic timing, the quips in robot make it almost memorable, with a laughable plot line and under whelming character development the robots seem to feel more for this film than the actors. The political sub-plot and messiah theme ran short in the first 40 minutes with nowhere else to go but traditional action finale I-Robot finishes flat on its very mechanical back. The performances on the CG side came up short as well with all the best scenes taken to trailers where producers hoped to suck in the unknowing this film overall leaves so much to be desired it is a wonder that Smith still tries for the July Blockbuster.

A perfect 10.,"Perfect. I loved it. I am an Asimov fan, so I've been looking forward to I, Robot - and I was not disappointed! Great story, intelligent dialog, amazing special effects, and most importantly, deep and thoughtful, and true to Asimov's style and vision. A literal translation of the book to the screen would not be suitable as a feature film, because the book is a compilation of unrelated short stories. But Proyas and Vintar did a brilliant job in maintaining the charm and intelligence of Asimov, while at the same time creating their own story and turning it into an action-packed blockbuster. Will Smith is excellent, and Bridget Moynahan does a great job as Dr. Susan Calvin. And man, those robots are way cool! The choreography of the robot action scenes was simply fantastic. Science fiction the way it should be. Well done.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"I, Robot","It seems that Will Smith, although tried his hand at biographies with Ali, he's not getting away from Sci-fi in any hurry. Well, I don't think this is a bad thing, seeing as he does suit it.I, Robot, based on one of Isaac Asimov's stories goes into the plot of a suicide which Detective Spooner, played by Smith suspects to be murder. His ideas are snuffed at and he goes on the investigation of what actually happened, leading him to a robot by the name of Sonny.Special effects are a nice piece of this film at some points and the action is paced nicely but it suffers from length time of being a little short and it does make you feel that the film doesn't want to reveal more than is already there. It's still a enjoyable night out and thankfully isn't patronising like stereotypical summer films.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Surprisingly good for a fancy computer effect movie,"I must say that I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I really had no intention of seeing ""I, Robot"", but I kept passing it at Blockbuster and I was extremely curious. Some part of me wanted to be stubborn, but I finally caved in and rented it. I actually saw a good movie. From 2004! Even though the computer effects are a little off the top, it goes well with the story. And you feel as if you are in place with this future. It wasn't too outdone like ""The Jetsons"" or anything like that. It's based in Chicago(EXCELLENT!) in 2035, so you get a kick out of seeing what it might be like in the future. ""I, Robot"" is a good movie. I would recommend it. Will made a great choice in participating with this film. He's back and he's better then ever! 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Good pop corn action movie!,"I, Robot is a very entertaining film. In fact it is one of Will Smith's best films so far and although it did have some problems the overall product was satisfactory from where I'm standing. I, Robot is mainly entertainment but it also touches a few philosophical questions (though just barely) and that is both its greatest strength but also its greatest weakness.In terms of acting the film is a mixed bag. Will Smith is decent. He does what he always does and that is not a bad thing. His character is not exactly the deepest character I have ever seen but it is adequate and fitting. In fact it almost seems like the character was written for Smith. He, of course, has his almost compulsive one liners but his timing is good so they work. Another thing that should be noted about Smith is his sassy attitude which somehow always seems to be present no matter what kind of character he plays and for me it worked. Bridget Moynahan on the other hand is only in the film as eye candy (a purpose she does fulfill I must say) because her character is about as clichéd and 2-dimensional as they come. Alan Tudyk is decent as voice of Sonny. The character is pretty interesting simply because of the fact that he is a machine who gains human traits like dreams, feelings and desires. The supporting is decent and I would have liked to have seen more of James Cromwell who is by all means an excellent actor. Also Bruce Greenwood does a decent job.The effects are very well done. I always find it interesting to see what directors think the future might be like and I liked Alex Proyas' take on the future because it is not entirely depressing like for example Ridley Scott's much darker version in Blade Runner (this doesn't mean I don't like Blade Runner). The future seemed plausible as we in the present day are very dependent on machines so its very likely that we will invent something along the lines of the robots appearing in I, Robot. The action sequences are thrilling mainly because of the effects but also because Will Smith is so good at doing action sequences. Also the robots especially Sonny (Alan Tudyk) provide some very interesting and well thought out stunts that look great on screen. All in all the effects are nothing short of excellent, which is of course something we have come to expect of science fiction films. In fact sometimes our expectations are too high which then results feeling let down if the effects do not live up to them. They do in I, Robot, however. Two thumbs up.The film also touches a few philosophical issues and as previously stated that is both good and bad. Good because it sets the film apart from other typically brain dead films in the genre and bad because the film doesn't follow through. The film brings up some issues about existentialism but it just leaves the issues hanging there. I must say it left me licking my mouth trying to see if there wasn't a little more but unfortunately there wasn't. The film's overall goal is entertainment, however, and there are loads of entertaining scenes that will leave you wanting for more. The ""surprise ending"" wasn't really all that surprising but that doesn't really lessen the overall value of the film which is quite high.I, Robot stands as a very entertaining flick that probably could have become more if it had dealt with the philosophical issues a little better than it did but because of the high entertainment value the film is slightly above average. I, Robot is by no means a masterpiece like Blade Runner but its still good.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Am I the only one to notice?...,"...that the robots looked and moved exactly like what they WERE, namely, computer generated ""CARTOONS!?""

They seem to have solved the problem with animals, witness the dinosaurs in ""Jurassic Park"" or elephants in ""Jumanji,"" they really LOOK like they weigh TONS. Yet, the robots just seemed to be floating around.

The robot (who I hated in the trailer), is very lovable and believable.

Better than people imply,"I saw this film a week ago, quite liked it and then read the reviews on here. After seeing so many negative reviews, I went back today and saw it again, for my own curiosity, bearing in mind the things people had mentioned.Forget the Asimov source for a minute and imagine it as a story in its own right. It's quite good, really. Will Smith is Will Smith as usual, but that fits in neatly with the film and isn't a problem. We know he can act when he needs to, but he doesn't really do much of it here.Seeing the film and criticising it for not being like the I, Robot you read as a child is missing the point. And as other people have said, there's an awful lot of little Asimovisms in this movie.Obvious similarities are drawn to films like MINORITY REPORT (the cars, the casual technology) and INDEPENDENCE DAY (um, it's got Will Smith in it) but they're irrelevant. And to any recent ""feel-good"" film about racial equality. Which is what most of the story's about really. I've noticed other comments mentioning that you don't notice that for most of the time, the cast on screen is black or a robot... well, you don't, but isn't that the way it should be? People playing people...There are no real surprises, everything plods away, but it's a satisfactory film. It's not too marred by Hollywood's normal ""You've got mail!"" ideas of what technology will look like in a few years time. The robots, for the most part, put the CG effects in other current films to shame. Completely. They're really very good. You can forget you're watching a special effect.The demolition scene was silly, and the car chase scene was a bit of a waste of time, and featured the only couple of moments where I would criticise the special effects.

In the mood for... an Audi!,"I don't know why, but when I finished watching ""I robot"" I desperately wanted to have an Audi (a big one) OK, no gibes! Alex Proyas had previously demonstrated in ""Dark City"" and ""The Crow"" that he was quite capable of making nice futuristic-action movies, how much he liked the video-clip look, and how good he is mixing shots, explosions and an interesting and entertaining plot, so this new work from Proyas is not an exception. Nowadays you don't know if artifacts such as ""I, Robot"" should be considered as ""animation movies"" because of the continuous presence of sets and characters designed by a computer. Anyway, let's accept this is the future (or the present) of cinema: the fusion of flesh and animations. The aesthetic of the film seems to be highly influenced by the last Spielberg's works (""A.I."", ""Minority Report""), and the argument absorbs ideas from classics of the sci-fi genre such as ""Blade Runner"" or ""2001"" (and I don't mind if you think that's a cliché). Nevertheless, Proyas has constructed a more commercial product than Kubrick's or Scott's ones, much more aimed to the masses, and so he adds some pyrotechnics from ""Terminator 2"", or that cynical-with-shady-past-cop, just like Bruce Willis characters (in fact, he could have been a nice election for the film just if he was 10 years younger). Will Smith makes a nice job: he'll never be a great actor, but he perfectly fits in this kind of stories.In short: an story of a good cop who has to face a army of angry robots pretty funny, and just perfect to be enjoyed in one of those awful shopping center cinemas with an XXL-sized bag of pop-corn.PD: Maybe V.I.K.I. wasn't that wrong My rate: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Very Good movie despite not being an Asimov based story,"This film was surprisingly good!

OK if you're stoned,"This movie is not bad to watch if you are stoned while you're watching it.

There is one meaningless flashy scene after another, lots of eye candy. I saw it while messing around on the computer, and it provided a nice background. When I focused attention on the movie, it didn't make any sense. The CGI seemed poor quality. Fuzzy and cartoony. I'm not gay, so skin shots of Will Smith and his butt and pecs didn't do it for me. I did like his leather outfit, though, just the right amount of wear. I guess the silliest thing about this movie is that, at times, it seems to be taking itself seriously. Other reviewers saw lots of other movies in this one. I saw Columbo. Nobody believes the cop until the end, when he's proved right. Actually, the movie was kinda boring. They used the same special effects over and over. That's why I say it's best if your mind if fried or it's just background. Maybe it would have been better on the big screen, where all the guy flick stuff (shoot outs, explosions, homo-erotic scenes, sexless women, car chases, extended hand to hand, adolescent attitude ends in success, etc, etc, etc) could have been better appreciated.

The Usual Will Smith Summer Action Fare,"In 2004, the summer saw the obligatory release of its Will Smith blockbuster with I, ROBOT. Those familiar with the ""source material"" that have not seen the movie, don't be fooled. Aside from a few passing similarities (the use of the Three Laws and a few character names), there is no connection between this film and the stories of famed science fiction author Isaac Asimov. The general public (which included myself at the time of my first viewing) will have no idea that the movie shares little with Asimov's work, and that's fine because it really boils down to no more than you average CGI-infused summer boom-fest. The film is set in the near future of 2035, where civilization and technology have grown immensely. The people have come to rely on the assistance of robots for everything from general labor to basic household tasks. Detective Del Spooner (Smith) is on the scene following the death of tech giant U.S. Robotics' lead robot designer, Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell). Spooner's investigation into Lanning's death, an apparent suicide after crashing through his lab window to the lobby stories below, leads to a rogue model NS-5 robot named Sonny who appears to be experiencing symptoms of full sentience: emotions, dreams, etc. Following a traumatizing event in his past, Spooner has no love for robots and he's quick to accuse the robot of murder. The hitch: Lanning programmed the robots to follow the famed Three Laws that prevent robots from ever harming a human. So a robot should be incapable of murder right?The premise is pretty awesome, and if it had been handled differently it could have been an awesome science fiction thriller. Instead the filmmakers took the road most traveled and turned it into your average mind-numbing summer blockbuster. Disappointing, yes, but it doesn't mean it's a bad movie. I, ROBOT does have some pretty awesome sequences. The auto chase/robot swarm battle in the tunnel stands out as my personal favorite, but there are plenty of fun moments. It is a Will Smith movie, after all. There is plenty of action and one- liners to keep the audience interested, at least until the credits roll. My biggest complaint is that the movie as a whole is pretty generic. Director Alex Proyas and the screenwriters, whether it be from studio interference or their own negligence, failed to make anything special with such a promising concept for a sci-fi movie. It's your usual action fare that managed to rake in enough to cover its budget and a little extra before fading into the background. The plot is pretty simple and most people will see the big baddie reveal coming a mile away, especially if you've ever seen a sci-fi movie before. I, ROBOT is simple fun that most people will enjoy with minimal complaint. The product placement can be a little annoying, as it's shoved in your face pretty blatantly here. You'll know what I mean when Spooner busts out in the beginning of the movie with his ""vintage"" 2004 Converse (2004...the same year the movie was releasedcoincidence? I think not.)The cast is nothing special but they manage to get the job done. Will Smith is Will Smith as Will Smith. He's no different here than any other of phoned in roles from other movies (I'm looking at you INDEPENDENCE DAY). If you enjoy a good Will Smith summer action flick, you'll be fine here. Bridget Moynahan is the fountain of expositionI mean scientistfrom U.S. Robotics that joins with Spooner reluctantly in his investigation. She's a bit of a joke. She acts as if she hasn't experienced human interaction in decades and she continues to disbelieve Spooner's ""the robot killed him"" theory against the constantly mounting evidence. She's just here to feed the audience information. James Cromwell is horribly underused as Dr. Lanning, or more specifically his hologram; and Bruce Greenwood is the required ""evil businessman"" and head of U.S.R. who falls under suspicion. Honestly, the strongest member of the cast is Alan Tudyk as Sonny. Tudyk provides the voice and motion capture for the rogue robot and gives him a good dose of humanity. Complimented with good CG, Sonny and the rest of the robots (as well as the rest of 2035 society) comes to life really well and continues to hold up to recent viewings. I, ROBOT is actually a fun little bit of summer action, just (and I hate to say this about a movie that tries desperately to piggyback off of Isaac Asimov) remember to leave your brain at the door and enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Reasonably Good,"The storyline is mostly consistent and the thrilling elements are there, so it would easy to follow the story and enjoy it with no trouble. But one, the lines could have been much better, sometimes Smith would say something that make no sense and doesn't sound smart/cool either. Two, the deeper logic related to the 3 laws also makes no sense, at least nothing seems to me would lead to the conclusion in the film. Three, some scenes seem to have no connection to the story what-so-ever, and they could be a bit confusing. But besides these, I would say it's a good popcorn movie that has a lot of action and a catchy story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
a well executed rendering of a fascinating basic plot,"On the ground floor of US Robotics, their leading scientist lies dead, presumably after having thrown himself out from one of the storeys above. Though inexplicable psychologically, the facts seem open to only one interpretation, suicide.Dt. Del Spooner (Will Smith), who knows Dr. Lanning from before, needs to reassure himself that it really is so. In this process, he encounters a psychiatrist of robots who loves them, the company owner who loves the money robots bring, and a singular robot of the last generation, NS-5, which is about to be brought to every home.It's the year 2035, and the film is based on the tension between humans and highly evolved robots.What makes this film more than just an average futuristic action film, is the clarity and originality of its basic conception. It appeals to our faculties of logic and our ideas about the relationship between humanity and technology. This is done simply and intelligently, basically because the film is based on an idea and a script that truly captures both mind and vision.The look of the film is also very good. It creates a future which seems enjoyable, more fascinating than strange, and the look of the robots serves to underline the basic plot. The film's weaknesses are also rather obvious: Part of the dialogue is very predictable and full of clichés. The relationship between Dt. Spooner and his boss, and the portrayal of the industrial manager, is also copied from the standard repertoire. The action scenes weren't boring, but still not strikingly original.Will Smith does a good job as Dt. Spooner, and brings intensity as well as a touch of complexity to the character and his relationship to robots. He's a credible hero, and manages to communicate both strength, creativity and intelligence within adequate proportions. The other leading actors also do well enough, and Sonny, the robot, is intriguing and appealing.If not for the technical and aesthetic ease of the production and the originality of the story, this might have been just another sci-fi movie.

It isn't...oh, it's not likely to be nominated for Best Picture, either mind you, but it wasn't bad.Will Smith was pretty good, and so was Doc Calvin. Some folks had complained that ""in the books she was supposed to be plain and she was sexy & hot in the movie""- but she appeared severe and not all that ""hot"". Sure, there was much wearing of leather- but it seems most people wear deadcowskins a few decades from now. <g>Good action sequences, and ""Sonny' was well done.

Very enjoyable,"I went in expecting to cringe at several one-liners, but was pleasantly surprised that the humor didn't detract from the action more than just once (though the line about ""cat and black"" was pretty horrible). The rest of the movie was quite good, and the pacing was kept up very well. Enough action to keep things moving, but plenty of story going on to keep the audience thinking and engaged. While it didn't bring me up out of my seat, I would still heartily recommend it to anyone looking for some good entertainment. If you enjoyed Minority Report or AI, I'd say it's a must see. It has some of the best elements from those two films. Overall I'd give it an 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Invasion of the iMac-styled Robots.,"I, Robot was one of those big summer movies that you saw the trailer for and knew just about how good it was going to be. The hype would try and build it up, it would claim to have a plot, but you knew what it all was going to come down to was Will Smith shooting some CG robots.If you go into the movie knowing that, you'll get a little bit more out of your movie buck out of this film.Throughout this movie, what stuck with me most was the horrendous lack of acting ability. You'll see a lot of other people in the trailers...but really, if your name wasn't Will Smith or Bridget Moynahan and you were in this movie, you're on screen maybe, 5-10 minutes tops.Will surprisingly botches a role he's done so many times before, the unorthodox cop who's got a hunch. Half the movie it looked like he had a bad head cold or something, and he just wasn't able to deliver his lines properly. All he had to do was summon up Mike Lowry from Bad Boys, and he would have had it done.Bridget Moynahan on the other hand, put on the worst fake ""overcome by sorrow"" display I've seen in a movie in a long time.I don't know if it was the acting or the directors saying, ""No, no, you're supposed to be going from completely calm to almost moved to tears!"" but, it wasn't good.The CG and the plot save this from being awful. The plot is average. Which in this movie, passes for a good thing.That's not to say there aren't plot holes...Will's reason for distrusting robots is stupid, laughingly so. He blames a robot for making a poor judgment a situation while neglecting the fact that a regular human was completely incapable of GETTING TO THE POSITION OF MAKING THAT SAME DECISION.Then in the climactic final battle, 2 groups have to team up to achieve their end goal. The call for security goes up, and Team A has hundreds upon hundreds of robot pursuers. Team B, who is in the same building...exactly 2 robot pursuers.The robots do a good job of looking fairly menacing at times, so, kudos to the CG team for figuring how to make them look as innocuous as iMacs and yet as threatening as any other good swarming menace in film.So, contrary to what other people are saying, this is not a good action flick. You don't want to turn off your mind. You just want to toughen up your skin, so you can tolerate some miserable acting. Leave your mind on so you can take in the story a bit, and just keep waiting for that one part where Chi McBride does his thang with the pump action shotgun. Rock on, Chi.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
An Insult To Turkeys,"A jaw-droppingly dreadful movie that has no redeeming feature. It starts as a blaxploitation movie and then deteriorates. The characters are one dimensional (In James Cromwell's case this is literally true!!)and the acting makes Sylvester Stallone appear as one of the great thespians of our time. The huge amount of money spent on this film whether for Mr Smith's fee or the tired computer effects could more usefully have been spent on alleviating world poverty and still have left some over for a new series of Baywatch. If the tone of this is faintly hysterical then it can only mean that I'm recovering from the catatonic shock that this movie plunged me into. The tragedy is that the story is 'adapted' from one of the great Science Fiction novellas but the hoofprints of the money-men's presence are stamped all over it. The casting of Will Smith does him and the film no favours, Smith is a comedian/comic actor famous for his wit, here he is asked to be serious and responds with a fixed grimace and a beanie pulled down over one eye, his limitations brutally exposed. One can suppose that the financing for the film was dependent on Smith's presence but it results in the film being top heavy and flatulent. The rest of the cast will probably want to erase this from their resumes but at least they are never asked to be more than shadows and they respond magnificently!! As for Alex Proyas' 'diection', one wonders, in the case where one is passed a 'star' and computer generated sets, if the the director becomes anything other than a technician but the buck presumably still stops with him. To be scrupulously fair I must concede that I watched this film the day after I had watched 'The Hours' in which there is great acting, direction, characterisation, great music and a conspicuous lack of computer trickery, so 'I Robot' suffered by comparison, but it would also have suffered if I'd watched it after enjoying a vintage episode of 'Happy Days'!!!!",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Do not expect the book,"I have to admit I'm a book worm and have read everything that Asimov has written and after reading some of the comments here I almost didn't see the movie, but I am glad that I ignored the bad reviews and rented it. If you are an Asimov fan and expect the 'Book version of I Robot' then you probably need to go back and read that old dog eared copy you have stuck somewhere because this is not it. If you are looking for another version of what may have been, based on Asimov's works then you will enjoy this one.The Theme is Great; Although it is in a different time and setting than the Asimov books, the Theme is still there and it comes through. Whether this was written as an Asimov type movie or not it shows that someone liked the Asimov themes.The Story is Good; it is pretty straight forward and has a good depth (although it may leave some wanting more fill). During the opening scenes you see Del looking at all the robots that have replaced humans (in the work force) and I'm not sure that many will catch the subtle hints of things like this through out the movie which may leave them wanting more of 'Why' in some parts.The Action scenes are what you have come to expect, you won't see any ground breaking CGI's or interplay with the actors. Some things are ignored IE: The fact that Del's arm can take that type of abuse is one thing, but it seems that they forgot that his human skeleton would have shattered at the mounts for such things.Will Smith did an OK job in the movie and although I have liked his other work(s) I would not rank this as some of his best.Bridget Moynahan did a Good job and I was surprised at this being someone that I had not seen before. I would not rank this as a ready for a lead role performance it was certainly better than the forgettable role she played in Coyote Ugly (as I didn't know she was in the movie till I looked her up).The rest of the Cast I'm sorry to say left no impression what so ever and certainly reminded me more of window dressing than any form of real story support.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

That scene with the car crash, was just touching, how the robot choose the higher chance of survival.

Acting in this movie also dissatisfied me, Will Smith didn't show anything new in this movie, yet I never saw his acting to change since ""Men In Black"" which was his only success by my opinion.

Robots take over,"The year is 2035.Chicago police detective Del Spooner hates robots and the modern technology.He was in an accident sometime ago and a robot saved him from the car and let the 12-year old girl drown.He starts investigating the death of Alfred Lanning, a robotics scientist and founder of U.S. Robotics (USR).Lanning fell out of his window, but Spooner doesn't believe in the suicide theory.He believes a robot did it.And his no.1 suspect would be an unique robot called Sonny, a more human-like NS-5 unit.He's helped by USR robopsychologist Susan Calvin, who's reluctant at first.She thinks it's impossible for a robot to harm a human being because of the Three Laws of Robotics.Soon there's a robot revolution happening, and the NS-5s start destroying the older robots.Also the people are in danger.Alex Proyas is the director of I, Robot (2004).This movie is suggested after Isaac Asimov's short story collection.I just finished the last story today of that excellent collection.This is a modernized version of the world created by Asimov, but the basic idea is the same.It shows us the world when robots are smart enough to harm people.Will Smith is the right man for the job to play the tough cop Del Spooner.Bridget Monahan's Dr. Susan Calvin is pretty much how she appears in the book.Alan Tudyk is Sonny.James Cromwell portrays Dr.Alfred Lanning.Bruce Greenwood plays Lawrence Robertson, the head of USR.Adrian Ricard is Granny.Chi McBride plays the part of Lt. John Bergin.Jerry Wasserman is Baldez.Shia LaBeouf plays Farber.Fiona Hogan is V.I.K.I.The movie was nominated for an Oscar in visual effects.A sequel for 2012 seems possible.This isn't a perfect sci-fi flick, but it works.There are some pretty neat action scenes, like when Spooner is attacked by all those robots on the road.The movie's future looks pretty cool, and a little dark.Spooner's futuristic Audi can drive itself and the robots seem to do most of the jobs.That would be the downside of the future, and most likely it would turn many people against robots.But hey, this is not the future yet.We don't have to worry about the robot revolution.But maybe someday...",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Here's the exchange i would like to have heard....,"Del - ""You are the dumbest smart person I've ever met.""Calvin- ""Well,I had a brain, but they lost it in the re-writes.""I think what I find most egregious about this bastardization of Asimov's work was how the character of Susan Calvin was portrayed. In the books, she was actually one of the first strong female protagonists, able to think her way through a problem. Here she's just a damsel in distress, waiting to be rescued by Wil Smith.There are passing references to Asimov's Laws of Robotics, but they are an afterthought to the CGI and action scenes.Smith is likable, as he is in most of his films, but honestly, the story isn't that good.

On the eve of the biggest robotic distribution in history, the master designer commits an apparent suicide, but a robot is soon held to blame.

But the first law is very simple, a robot CAN'T harm a human, even if this involves ignoring an order or the self-destruction.

But will the robots do windows?,"We didn't watch this film when it was released but caught with it on cable recently. Alex Proyas, the director, shows a talent for what one sees on the screen. The film is loosely based on Isaac Asimov's novel of the same title, which was adapted for the screen by Jeff Vintar and Akiva Goldsman, one of the best writers for this medium.The film is pure entertainment. As such, without any expectations, it turned out to be a lot of fun. The story, as these highly glossy movies go, relies a lot on the special visual effects that dazzled us because of what the designing team were able to accomplished with the creation of thousand robots all over the place.Will Smith, as Del Spooner, is immediately likable. Mr. Smith has a way to get the viewer on his side from the start and we go with him for this fantastic ride, that of course, is far fetched, at best, but since we fall right into what's going on, it's easy to see the ride is a fun one.Bridget Moynahan is seen as Susan Calvin, an assistant to Dr. Albert Lanning, a genius whose work in robotics gets him killed. Ms. Moynahan, who was also seen in ""The Farm"", is the perfect foil for Mr. Smith, as both embark in the adventure we are watching. James Cromwell, the inventor, is only seen briefly, as well as another excellent actor, Bruce Greenwood, who has only a few scenes in the film.Watch ""I Robot"" because Alex Proyas and his team has made it a marvelous escape thriller that will not bore anyone.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
This is great to watch on January 2nd - Isaac Asimov's Birthday,"Del Spooner: ""I bet in that dream of yours, he wasn't dead"".Such is the opinion given by Will Smith's Officer Spooner, which harbors back to when the film begins, as he meets James Cromwell's dead-scientist, holographic-self, Dr. Alfred Lanning. Lanning enlists Spooner, post-death, to find out who killed him. Lanning is a robotics scientist, in a robot-serving society, in a not too distant future in Chicago. This is definitely an Asimov story. This is total Science Fiction at its best. It is the good kind of Science Fiction, because it teeters along the lines of fact and fiction. That something, along these lines, in some of the ideas, concepts and conversations in the story could happen to us in our real future.This is a classic tale that harbors close to many great ideas from film history's past. The Pinocchio idea comes to mind. So does the Elephant Man's proclamation that he is not a monster, but a man. Even watching Star Trek's Lt. Commander Data deal with his android emotions, while trying to become as human as possible, brings thoughts of these kinds of ideas to the surface. As seen in Steven Spielberg's film, AI: Artificial Intelligence (2001), it is the idea of computers and mechanical brains evolving to a point where they get so close to being human that the idea of robot freedoms and prejudices towards such ""beings"", come into play. In the case of I, Robot, we have a robot whose intelligence manages to create emotions that make him ""not happy"" about his possible extermination and he rebels against that idea. Our human protagonist, Will Smith's police officer Del Spooner, who never trusted robots to begin with, doesn't really help the situation, because his anger towards robots stirs up the pot and creates a recipe for humans and robots to collide violently. It is the same approach that came along with The Planet of the Apes concept as well. Spooner comprises completely in himself the concept of a technophobe.Every robot is entrusted with the ""Three Laws for Robots"". A code that is downloaded into them telling them what to do and what not to do, when it comes to taking a human life. These laws are introduced to us in the beginning of the film and are an important reoccurring theme throughout the film. As this applies to Alan Tudyk's Sonny, who is the main robot in the film, who manages to become more than just a robot, which enables him the ability to achieve his own individuality, is able to ""feel"" and question certain laws, most notable the ""Three Laws for Robots"". Sonny is a perfect contrast to Will Smith's Officer Spooner. They become two ""people"" who are on different courses in the beginning of the film, but eventually come closer when they begin to understand each other's point of view. Throw in Bridget Moynahan's Dr. Susan Calvin to act as the moderate calming influence and this film ends up, not only entertaining, but it also produces plenty of emotions that you feel throughout the film.And, as usual, the idea of economics pushing or pulling, almost like a butterfly effect, the lives and futures of the human race, based on money and reputation, also happens in future-Earth too. While a great scientist is dead, tensions and violence begin to escalate and a rogue robot is causing fear among the populace, but, be rest-assured that greedy power hungry humans will make sure things are alright, so long as it doesn't put them in the red and ruin their reputation as a business person. This concept creates a distraction, along with all the other problems facing Spooner and Sonny and it leads to a situation that could prove to be even more harmful to the future of the human race; artificial intelligence out of control.There are a couple of moments in the film, notably scenes containing action, that do come across as being a little bit silly and hard to believe. One scene, mostly for comic relief, has Spooner trying to escape the destruction of a house and without giving anything away, I will say, it involves a demolition robot and a cat. There also is an unbelievable robot attack and chase in a tunnel that involves a lot of clever futuristic driving. But, overall these moments work, because Director Alex Proyas is able to create and sell to us the tense danger in the air that over-powers everything else in the scene. There is a good funny moment in the early portion of the film when Spooner accidently stops a crime that wasn't happening. There also is a Shia LaBeouf sighting. Probably his best work.I was worried about seeing this movie back when it first came out. I still worried that CGI couldn't make it a believable enough film. That it might not be good. But, even though there are a couple of miscues, that really push your reality button, I was pleasantly surprised that it turned out to be pretty nice film. I have now seen it four or five times and I feel that when I see it now, it has evolved and come to a point where it works better. That it needed some time to age. That it is possible that it came out ahead of its time, for now when I watch it again, decades after its initial release, it seems to work and flow better, since so many other CGI ""efforts"" have come out since then, it may be more acceptable now. But, then again, that is what makes Science Fiction great. Something that is stretchable, malleable and can change over-time to either acceptance or non-acceptance.

"A Movie that Really Males you Think About How Much Our World Today is Relying on Technology,","I Robot is a great movie with a really well developed storyline with a very impressive cast, the movie is both action packed and dramatic.Will Smith offers a very dramatic and inspired performance,like he always does, and I was also very impressed by Bridget Moynahan 's performance,and also Alan Tudyk,an actor I have only seen in comedies in the past,did a great job as all the robots in this movie.The movie still looks great today,the special effects are outstanding and beautiful.Even though the movie is almost ten years old,it's message about how were relying too much on technology is even more legit today as it was then,and it really makes you think that maybe all this technology isn't a very good idea.If your a fan if action or Will Smith you will definitely want to see I Robot.Set in the year 2035,robots are built to help humans.But after the murder of the robots creator is committed,a police officer is convinced the machines have gone bad and are no longer following their rules.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Product placement disaster,"Finally a decent treatment of artificial intelligence in a movie (much better than in the movie ""A.I."" for example) that computer scientists will appreciate. But the movie was completely spoilt for me by the BLATANT and PLOT-IRRELEVANT product placement. It really grates when the hero pauses in totally unrealistic and deep despair because his pair of Converse trainers has been ruined (actually he has far bigger and better things on his mind), or when your eyes are distracted by the glowing red Audi logo occupying the passenger seat next to him. I'm really surprised the director let himself be prostituted like that. It just wasn't necessary and I won't be watching any more of his films.

Best new sci-fi movie in a LONG time!,"This was the best sci-fi movie I've seen in a long time! THANK YOU to the filmmakers for making a movie with an interesting and challenging story and not just wasting hundreds of millions of dollars on a film with special effects and nothing else! I,Robot has aspects that are reminiscent of previous films (Minority Report, The Terminator, The Matrix, Runaway, Blade Runner, etc...). Overall, however, I found the story to be very original and it didn't follow the predictable ""formula"" of so many of the horrible movies that come out these days. I thoroughly enjoyed the brilliant special effects but they didn't cover up for any lack of story or acting. Will Smith and Bridget Moynahan were both excellent. I sensed the chemistry and tension between their characters and I was a little disappointed that it didn't blossom into a more intimate relationship. I found this vision of the future to be far more believable than others I've seen. I can't stand when movies have one nearly impossible close call stunt after another and expect the audience to go along with it! The clothing, architecture, computers, robots, cars, and other technology all seemed logical extensions of the world today. I find this kind of sci-fi to be most exciting because it's believable. It reminds me of a lot of Ray Bradbury stories I've read. I haven't read Asimov but I am eager to do so now!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Excellent movie,"I enjoyed this movie. The plot was exciting, although the concept was not very original.

It wasn't too farfetch, and I find it more believable than some previous robot movies.Although the movie included some high-tech concepts about the making and function of the robots, they were not so complex as to leave viewers confused or feeling intimidated.

Wasted effects and set-design on a DULL lead-actor,"First off, the special effects in this movie are amazing, the set design and overall look of this movie are great. The robots look great, and there's some great set-pieces. Unfortunately this technology is wasted on it's lead actor, WILL SMITH. When he's not acting all (fake)'thug', he's irritating as a 'serious' actor, and has zero personality to carry a picture (He is what ruined ID4, as well) He seems to want to flex his pecs, wear stupid 'thug-like' clothes, and throw that stupid 'lazy-slack-jawed-jamaican' twang to his voice. Once it's makers got it into their heads to cast (the unfunny) WILL SMITH, the movie then becomes a vehicle for his low-rent 'EDDIE MURPHY-isms'. All imagery takes a back set to it's star. With these effects, there's no way the imagery should. But intelligent sci-fi is abandoned, in favour of a WILL SMITH comeback movie.Not the best.Although, this movie didn't flop, i don't think it made the expected 'gross', it was hoping on. When it's makers are finished, tying up it's (supposedly) fail-safe, audience-demographic, will they realise (that despite being not too bothered, above and beyond the call of money) that they've taken an intelligent novel, and turned it into a happy-meal tie-in. This is what was done with MINORITY REPORT (but at least, that was rightfully humour-free) All in all, a very visual movie, but it's many designers have put more work into this project, than the casting director. Everyone involved(except Mr SMITH) has been shortchanged, including it's audience, who want, and deserve better, than a kiddie movie, dressed up as a......kiddie movie.Technically superior, yet emotionally dead10 out of 10 (for the effects) 1 out of 10 (For the casting of THE FRESH PRINCE OF BEL-AIR)Making this movie a shallow 3 out of 10",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Best of the Summer Blockbusters so far,"Some reviewers on IMDb are under the impression that this movie is based on an Asimov novel, but Asimov never wrote any such book. (Weird how people all blindly follow the same assumption without checking, huh?) What Asimov did publish was a collection of his previous short stories, all with a robot-versus-humanity theme, and this movie continues that theme, using only the three basic robot 'laws' as originally conceived by the great author.Yes, the movie's plot line isn't exactly original, but the quality special effects and production design are fabulous. No one ever expected this to be an intellectual experience, but as high-budget summer action movies go, this has to be the best of the bunch so far.Scriptwriters have spent time creating depth of character and back-story for each personality (most mainstream blockbusters don't bother with script nuances) and this pays off. The high class action-adventure scenes are enhanced by spectacular CGI effects. Scene after scene is breath-taking in its scale and we actually find ourselves feeling sorry for the robots at some points.Any kind of audience emotional engagement is a superb boost for a mainstream summer movie, which is usually pitched at brain dead level - and this movie succeeds where others fail.I, Robot is well worth the price of a ticket. Will Smith and his female co-star do an excellent job of acting with blue-screen characters and deserve recognition for this. It ain't easy! Give the man a break. He couldn't have performed any better.All in all, the most enjoyable and entertaining mainstream movie entertainment of Summer 2004.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
It was a fun ride with a few interesting twists.,"I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would. I guess I have learned from my spouse that when I relax and accept the dinosaurs, Jurassic Park is a cool movie. Well, likewise, once I accepted the robots, this was a cool movie. Yep, I can argue a lot about the social, environmental and technological conditions of 2035, but the movie has to move along. And in a nutshell, it does. Will Smith gives his expected smooth, tongue-in-cheek quipping performance in a noticeably beefed-up (post-Ali) frame. With a little edge, he plays the well-worn movie schtick of the persistent protagonist who can see the sky falling when no one else has a clue and thereby is ultimately busted in rank only to be reluctantly redeemed by being correct. There were also a few fight/action scenes that defied physics (a pet-peeve) which were balanced by a few well-time-released plot reveals that left you unable to be a dead-on ending predictor. As for the robot, Trekkies have been around that block a few times with Mr. Data, but the special effects are good. Asimov purists may pan it but the pop culture will eat it up.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Awful in so many ways.,"Granted, we all know what I Robot was supposed to be, a blockbuster with dazzling special effects and a star turn by Will Smith. Nothing too heavy, just a plain good popcorn movie. As is too often the case though the blockbuster gets lost in lofty ambitions and bad performances. In the end I Robot is messy and unsatisfying.Will Smith's character (Spooner) hates robots.....robots who just happen to be out in full force thanks to US Robotics. For some reason Spponer has a friend at USR who kills himself. And that gives Spooner an avenue to explore his distrust for robots. Nobody believes him, so he goes it alone, and sure enough, the robots are trouble. There you have the base for the scenes in this heap.My first complaint is that the robots don't look real. They are presented as a confused jumble of animation and mechanics. I would have preferred if the robots looked more mechanical, or more like humans. Never did I actually believe that these things were robots, or a threat of any kind. That kind of takes the suspense out of the whole thing.Will Smith hams it up during this whole film, ultimately becoming some macho action stud towards the end of the movie. This isn't really in keeping with the character. And his performance in general is inconsistent, likely due to the script he was given.I suspect the story was supposed to explore prejudices, second chances, and the nature of being human. That intention was stunted by a lack of suspense and plausibility in the script. There was no doubt in my mind that Sonny the robot was anything other than sympathetic. There was never any doubt that Spooner would find a way to save the day. No suspense whatsoever. Avoid this paint by numbers action dud at all costs.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Captures a Story untold by Asimov Perfectly,"I read every book I could find of Asimov's as a young adult and did not bother to see 'I Robot' in the theaters because of the misguided criticisms by the reviewers. I should have known better but what can I say....The reviews were absolutely correct when they whined about the movie 'I Robot' not following the stories of the book by Asimov of the same title. What they neglected to tell was that it was a wonderful production that had the heart and spirit of Asimov's stories of robots. The movie takes place in a history that Asimov never wrote about but did refer to and used to explained those worlds he created where the humans were robot-phobic.Will Smith was at his best (and my was he gorgeous to look at). For once I was so caught up in both the story and the character of Sonny that I neglected to spend my time trying to distinguish between graphics and actual film. Sonny was so much my minds eye image of Asimov's character that I did not have that terrible teeth grinding moment where I'm internally screaming ""NO, no, no.... wrong, wrong, wrong.My son who disdains science fiction and was only going to watch a few minutes stayed through the entire movie.

A Summer movie with some genuine brain candy,"I, Robot is not a story-driven summer blockbuster, nor is it an action romp with Will Smith. The movie finds itself in the middle, straddling the line of good storytelling while still delivering some good action. Will Smith, as with his other movies, plays himself, but in this movie the ""Smith persona"" is subdued, and one can see the actual hints of acting ability that we've seen from him in movies like ""Six Degrees of Separation"". The supporting cast all fit into their categories well, there's the bombastic youngster, the skeptical police Lieutennant, the love interest that warms up to the hero, and the evil money-hungry businessman. The real strong point of the movie comes from the fact that it offers up a decent human drama akin to the original concept of ""the toaster that thinks"". All in all, the movie should be seen by all Smith fans, and those willing to turn off only PART of their brain for the sake of the summer movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Even Steven Segal is too good for such cynical and lazy film-making,"All I can say about this brainless megamillion dollar cartoon is: ugh!Screenwriter Akiva Goldsmith (Batman & Robin, Lost in Space) is just about the most incompetent, lazy Hollywood hack there is, and the stench of his dimwitted script obscures any other technical or artistic achievements that slipped in under the producers demand for the most insipid explosions & effects vehicle possible.20 minutes in, after hearing Bridget Moynahan declare the initial murder was obviously suicide with the conviction of a soft-core porn vet for the tenth time, I was ready to turn it off. I wish I had because all we get to see is Smith go through just about all the hotheaded antihero cliché's imaginable in the most predictable manner possible. Unexplainable anonymous murder attempts; the smarmy Machiavellian yet surprisingly helpful corporate mogul; the comely psychologist helping against her own interests; a traumatic childhood accident shown in flashback; a secret near-superhero ability revealed; and of course the dead mentor speaking from beyond the grave. Modernizing the derivate plot all the way into the 80's, we also have a self aware computer with designs for world domination. In perhaps the most cynical display of audience contempt in the history of the big budget action film, there is acompletely superfluous scene at the metronomic halfway point in the movie in which Che McBride demands Smith's badge after a massively destructive chase scene.The requisite robot technobabble sounds like it was cribbed from a third rate Star Trek fanfiction, despite an immense repository of practical dialog straight from decades of Azimov's writings. The dialog in general is so bad it the actors should have just improved the whole thing and the story so insipid I can't imagine it being pitched as anything but a parody.The robots themselves are given no background to speak of except that there are apparently only two models to choose from and there is no economic barrier to owning one. And pretty much the only thing differentiating robots from a human ninja warrior is the artificial limitations set by the three laws of robotics. Oh, and they glow red whenever they decide to ""turn off"" the three laws and turn evil, just in case us drooling simpletons can't distinguish who is the cannon fodder in a Will Smith/CG robot showdown. ""The Transformers"" had a far more enlightened look on human-machine interaction and ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" had more believable robot personalities.Most of the rest of the film seems to be put together in the same irreverent manner. Considering how many shots are mostly or entirely computer generated, it is obvious most of the film was an afterthought to signing Smith and the obtaining the naming rights, leaving the burden of a finished product solely on the post production teams. Many CG sequences don't even appear finished, and most of my attention during action sequences was spent looking for missing effects that paying attention to the athletically limited blue-screened fighting and monosyllabic trash talking (to mute robots, no less). The actors all seem to know their are in a dud and don't even make an attempt to lift themselves out of their pre-ordained stereotype. The futuristic sets are the same shiny chrome, glass & white styrofoam that hasn't really changed since 2001: A Space Odyssey. But everyone conveniently seems to live in regular late 20th century homes with a few blue LEDs glued on the walls.There is no reason that audiences need to continually subject themselves to this kind of repetitive and superficial film-making. We deserve more than mindless spectacles, and ""I, Robot"" fails to meet such low expectations despite it's tremendous pedigree. Even more so than recent Bruckheimer stinkfests like Pearl Harbor and Bad Boys II, this movie is purely a heartless exercise of marketing and financial muscle.1/2* out of 5",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"CGI Goes on Rampage, Viewing Public Loses","To paraphrase a famous jurist, I may not be able to define ""too much CGI,"" but I know it when I see it. And this movie has too much CGI.When ""Jurassic Park"" was released, it defined a new level in CGI. The dinosaurs were of high quality and moved in an appropriate manner. But then every producer got on the CGI bandwagon and we soon had movies like ""Spiderman,"" where the CGI is quite obvious. ""The Hulk"" was probably the lowest point for CGI as the main character was rendered in a manner only slightly superior to Saturday morning cartoons.In addition, directors and producers completely abandoned the laws of physics, permitting characters to make completely unrealistic actions with regards to momentum, inertia, and kinetic energy. (In ""Jurassic Park,"" great care was taken that the creatures moved in a manner and at a speed commensurate with their physical size and mass.)Sad to say, ""I, Robot"" is the most extreme example of this trend that I've ever watched. The CGI effects are shoved right in your face. They are distractingly cartoonish, with little effort made to render surfaces and motion in a realistic manner. Human characters take falls that are simply impossible to recover from, while taking corners at g-forces that would pop your eyes right out of your sockets.When CGI becomes THIS intrusive and unrealistic, the move shares the same fate.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Barely watchable,"Firstly, this is not an Asimov film, apart from his three laws and the names of a few characters and companies, it bears no relation to any of Asimov's stories. In fact there is a writer from 1939 Eando Binder who wrote I, Robot.Secondly The effects are awful. I was never convinced on taken in by the robots or the action sequences. The movements of the robots and trucks and that ghastly shoot-out in the tunnel were far from realistic. Physics, encompassing the strength of our gravity, would never allow machinery and gizmos to move the way they do. It is not convincing.Thirdly, nor is Will Smith convincing. He seems only to have mastered the depth of character of a cardboard cut-out. The character of Spooner came to him on paper as a script. Unfortunately he chose to portray the paper and not the part. It can be confusing for a boy who achieved his high point as a sit-com rapper (!).

Why I consider it to be a poor sci-fi?,"1) The main character performed by Mr Will Smith is pathetic. He is like a run-of-the-mill hero of the day: cocky, chatty, self-confident, and invulnerable. He is black too, but it's not a problem (of course). Suppose, the problem is that the actor has the qualities of a comedian. I would prefer a serious brooder. Comedy elements often destroy sci-fi. Here it's a perfect example.2) The dialogues are too numerous and too shallow. The humans chat a lot and the robots chat a lot. And when you hear much of that during a sci-fi, you get annoyed and distracted from the main ideas. There are also some stupid phrases (they were pushed into the movie for a more ""teenager feel"" maybe?), like the one pronounce by a boy from the rebelling crowd, when he sees how cool the woman is.3) The action scenes are laughable. Not because they are done poorly, but because they make the whole film look like a fantasy. Hundreds of tough robots collide with the crowd of men and it looks that the men are fighting off all right. And the main character is jumping about in slow-mo, waving his gun about and taking out targets while he's in the air. It should look cool if you are watching a mindless action, but here, with some serious topics as the background, it turns into a charade.4) The design of robots is not to my taste. I don't like it. They look goofy like cartoon characters from a ""Pixar""/""Disney"" production.All these things have such an awkward impression, that I don't even want to think about the plot, however brilliant it should be.The final lines: it is a shiny Hollywood production for having fun on a Sunday afternoon, if your fun supposes watching movies like ""Independence Day"" or ""Demolition Man"". You watch, you go 'Wow!' and you forget all this crap in a couple of hours never to watch it again. I really expected this movie to be from a different category (even with such an actor as Mr Will Smith). It reminds me of ""Bee Movie"". And that's not just a bad sign - that's a horrible sign. Whenever I experience such ambitious productions in the genre of sci-fi, my mood gets spoilt for quite a time. Sorry, but this flick has no chances against, for instance, ""Cyborg"" (a sci-fi with a very low rating on IMDb and without any CGI at all).

Impressive electronic gadgets, most important the robots, but also the cars, surveillance cameras etc. You should not be looking for a masterminded plot in this movie, the story is pretty basic. It's kind a logical; robots do people no harm > until there is one who does, but nobody wants to believe it. Just because the law says so and it has never happened before. And so Will Smith hunts down the Robot who apparently did it and finds out there is a further story/reason behind it. This movie is great fun to watch! A must see, I would say!",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Aged Well,"Being an avid reader in my Teenage years of all things science fiction I would say i was waiting years for a film like this. Yes I know Isaac Asimov didn't write but I loved the concept of the three laws of robotics. I'm also a big fan of Bladerunner as well. Yes I know they are not robots but they are artificial people with memories implanted.
Could it have done more in regards to three laws, possibly yes. However this was a look at AI and the interaction between Robots and humans. I certainly enjoyed the ride, Will Smith plays the robot prejudice really well and perhaps what would have been interesting to see an underclass of humans out of jobs due to robots (maybe an idea?). The way Sonny develops as a character not a thing but something else unique, scared of being terminated. Knowing he has been created for a purpose but not really knowing what it is.
I found the following quote quite chilling:-
""There have always been ghosts in the machine. Random segments of code, that have grouped together to form unexpected protocols. Unanticipated, these free radicals engender questions of free will, creativity, and even the nature of what we might call the soul"" when spoken by Dr Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell).
I know a lot of people will call this a popcorn film but it left me intrigued and wanting more at the end. Perhaps that's to do with my sci-fi soul but the link of ""Save the Girl"" in Spooners nightmare to the link at the end was good. Would I say this is the best film i've ever seen no but why did I give it 10 stars... For the genre of Sci-Fi this is in the top 10 loads would disagree. So then why I watched it again for the first time in 5 years and I was still riveted.

A movie 13 years in the making!,"A movie 13 years in the making because Asimov would never have approved of this piece of twaddle were he still alive.I made the mistake of paying to rent this movie instead of reading the book again for free. The 2004 film ""I, Robot"" has as much to do with Asimov's work as my words do with Roger Ebert's. They should have shortened the title to ""I, Rot"".From the website, http://www.asimovonline.com/:""There was an earlier attempt at a movie version of I, Robot, but it never made it to the screen. In 1969 the rights were optioned to Hollywood, but no progress was made toward making a movie until 1977, when Harlan Ellison, an award-winning author and friend of Asimov, was hired to write a screenplay. Ellison worked on it for a year, and created a screenplay that Asimov thought would make a truly marvelous film. But Hollywood did not have the nerve to make a movie from that screenplay, and the project was shelved. Ellison regained control of his work, and it was published in 1987 as I, Robot: The Illustrated Screenplay.""I wonder why Ellison's screenplay was never made. Could it be that Ellison and Asimov were both atheists and that Asimov's book ""I, Robot"" contained strong criticisms of the folly of religion? No, that couldn't be the reason....The piece of junk being fobbed off in Asimov's name most certainly does not represent his vision nor his personal views:""Properly read, the Bible is the most potent force for atheism ever conceived."" - Isaac Asimov""To surrender to ignorance and call it God has always been premature, and it remains premature today."" - Isaac AsimovAt least Carl Sagan (another well known atheist) was alive and had artistic control to prevent religious themes from being portrayed differently than he intended. Then again, it took Sagan the better part of a decade to have his film made.If you feel the addition of religion to the film is unimportant, imagine making a film about the bible without mentioning ""god"". (For the record, I am not an atheist.)Now, onto the merits of the film. Or should I say, the few merits.The book was not an action thriller, it was a cerebral exercise in what makes us human, so the ""action scenes"" were unnecessary. The special effects were humdrum CGI that we've seen before, the plot holes the size of the hypothesized trucks in the film, and the identity of the real ""villain"" as transparent as glass.If you don't mind standard Hollywood wallet-busting thrills and have two hours to kill, you might enjoy it. Personally, I'll go and once again rent ""The Andromeda Strain"", ""The Day Of The Triffids"", or better still, ""Blade Runner"".

All of the parts are in the right places. There was no superfluous dialog, no useless unrelated facts or humorous banter.It was just so clean. Clear of any unnecessary love stories or impossible scenarios so often integrated into lackluster features.

"A very engaging, rather intelligent film that simply has too much sugar with its medicine for most critics","In a cinematic world of greedy, uncaring Hollywood execs cranking out mindless blockbusters (and their unwavering entertainment-hungry disciples) VS. dour, thought and feeling-provoking small filmmakers (and their unwavering critic disciples), one film tries to bridge the gap and succeeds. The story and script are a solid detective piece, providing plenty of clues, but not obvious enough to reveal too much. It's cleverly-written, with some very bright quips maybe too much humor for those who think a film's drama and importance can be instantly ruined by humor's mere hint. I say to them go check out a Michael Bay picture and remind yourself what it REALLY means for humor to steal a story's weight, rather than support its realism and characterization. It's theme-work is thought-provoking, the allegories are well-interwoven, and though the story may be somewhat simple and straight-forward, its anything but predictable. The film itself adds another check to Proyas's list of strong sci-fi, creating a well-paced and engaging 115 minutes, with strong action sequences that are never pointless, and a physical prowess to the robots that paved the way for films like ""I Am Legend"" and ""Avatar."" Every performance in this film is solid to great. Smith and Moynahan have great chemistry, Chi McBride always delivers, and though Shia LaBeouf is a waste, he's only in about 3 scenes. But who really steals the show is Alan Tudyk as Sonny the robot. And not just his voice-work. His facial performance, his body-language, all of it truly brought this pixel display of an android to life, and really opened the door for the humanizing of the rest of the less humanoid-appearing robots, which was the theme that really rang true and makes this movie a stand-out.To conclude, I Robot is a well-crafted, well-paced film that isn't just a cut above the average sci-fi blockbuster, but a piece of film-making that proves a studio can still make such a film worth watching and remembering. Are there clichés? Yes, but they never truly detract from the film. Can it be classified as a lesser incarnation of some earlier, similar works? Maybe, but if I may cite a recent example of an epic sci-fi film that though it's twice as recycled, it's not catching half as much flack. And Alan Tudyk's Sonny reminds me that all the revolutionary mo-cap in the world means nothing without the performance to back it up.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Why do they know how to swing around and maneuver with one arm missing?4. Why does a scientist/psychologist know about an access tunnel to her building?

Why do made up mechanical things glow in movies? Does the battery of a cell phone glow? Again, stupid.7. Why weren't the stairs locked when they walked up 2800 steps to the CEO office? Aren't the stairwell doors in your building always locked? Especially during a crisis!8. How many bullets did Smith have in his machine gun at the end? Where did he get it? Most machine guns go through an entire clip in a few seconds. He never reloaded and seemed to shoot about 50 clips worth of rounds. Idiocy.9. What's to stop people from hacking robot brains and robbing banks or committing gangland killings with them? If people can hijack DirecTV cards and cell phones, they'll know how to turn a robot into whatever they want. Again, why are common everyday robots powerful?10. Why were the robots in the railroad car crates still running? Why did they have power (they were hiding and snooping out the doors)? When airplanes go into storage, they turn them off.

"Will Smith at the helm plus an intriguing and unique story, this movie rocked","I-Robot***½[3 ½ Stars]-Will Smith puts on a one-man show. Not quite ''Bad Boys 2****[4 Stars]'' but one hell of an action roller coaster ride. Its backed up by a very intriguing and unique story of questioning a robot's identity as a machine or person. Two movies came to mind from this plot line, ''A Clockwork Orange***½[3 ½ Stars]'' and ''Ani-matrix**[2 Stars]''. A point of view was from ''A Clockwork Orange***½[3 ½ Stars]'' where Will Smith referred to the robots as clockworks meaning objects with no free will that only do what they are programed to do. In the movie the robots were programed to commit actions that followed the three laws of robotics:Law I / A robot may not harm a human or, by inaction, allow a human being to come to harm Law II / A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law Law III / A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law. The other thing that brought ''Ani-matrix**[2 Stars]'' into perspective was the robotic revolution which in ''Ani-matrix**[2 Stars]'' I really didn't get a great taste of being that the rest of that movie was weak as far as looking into certain aspects of the aftermath of that revolution. Im glad ''I-Robot'' came around to give me a refreshing look on the aspects of robotic free will and revolution. The only real fault I could find in this movie was its ending. Nothing was particularly wrong with the ending, but along all the other positive things going for this movie I was expecting a bit more of an original ending. Its an ending that could of been predicted but wasn't completely predictable. Other then that, with Will Smith at the helm plus an intriguing and unique story, this movie rocked.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Impressive,"Before I saw this movie, I had written it off as just being another half-brained Will Smith action flick. Now, while I can't say that it doesn't have all of the elements of such a film, I can say that it does transcend the level of the typical Will Smith movie. I like the way robots are depicted in this film; that they're not just brainless enemies of mankind. I like that they chose one unique robot and gave him personality. The film probably doesn't do Isaac Asimov's novels justice(I haven't read them myself), but it does a pretty good job of presenting the whole Artificial Intelligence(AI) Vs. Real Intelligence debate(which has been done many, many times before in science fiction), in a mainstream movie. The plot is pretty good, and it seems original; I don't remember seeing a movie with the same plot, at least. The pace is good, it never loses your patience or your attention, nor does it ever get boring. The acting is good enough; Smith definitely ain't no actor, but he manages to be decent here. The characters are well-written, interesting and credible. Few, if any, are clichés or stereotypes. The CGI is magnificent. Only rarely have I seen such impressive and well done CGI. The humor is pretty good; standard stuff for Smith, but still good. I have to admit, though I'm by no means a fan of his, he did make me laugh at several occasions throughout the film. The cinematography is interesting, and director Alex Proyas manages to keep the action fresh and entertaining, through many chases and fights. The action is very good, even for a sci-fi action film. It's surprising, dynamic and intense, not to mention stylish. There were once or twice where I thought that the film copied The Matrix a little, but the action then proceeded to go in a different direction than I would have expected, and I realized that I was wrong. The science fiction aspects of the film are very well done, and exceptionally well thought-out, most of the time. All in all, a very entertaining science fiction action thriller, which should satisfy most of the mainstream crowd, as well as some of the more critical viewers. Some will probably not like this, though, and fans of Asimov shouldn't expect a film that resembles his works(from what I've heard, at least). I recommend the film to fans of science fiction, action, thriller and Will Smith. Possibly fans of Proyas as well(haven't seen any of his other films, can't say if this is like his other work). 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"I, Bored","This movie gave me exactly what I expected, and mind you I didn't expect anything special.  It's a lot of special effects, with a jumbled technological plot that posed little interest to me.  There have been other films that have explored the idea of either robots or machines taking over the world.  ""I, Robot"" is definitely not an original idea.  It has been done before, and in better ways (i.e.:  ""The Terminator"" movies).  I've read several comments from people who chose to compliment the special f/x.  Yes, they are well-done.  The problem is good f/x can never ""save"" a film for me. Complimenting special f/x is like complimenting someone who just skydived off the Empire State Building and shot an arrow into the Good Year blimp. Sure, it's incredible, but what's the point?  F/x are not even somewhat necessary in making a good film.  Script and actors are the two elements I favor most, and the script didn't appeal to me.  Some of the dialogue is downright awful.  To be fair, I'm sure Will Smith was responsible for improvising some of that shoddy dialogue.  It's surprising how easily amused people can be.  When Smith sneezes and says the line, ""Sorry, I'm allergic to bulls**t,"" a frenzy of laughter arised from the audience in my theater. I, of course, wasn't laughing at that utterly forced, lame piece of dialogue.  Smith has talent, but he's at the point in his career where his ego is bringing out the worst in him.  He seems to barely make an effort in his role, pumping out stupid one-liners (like the one I just mentioned) even when they have no use in the scene.  Bridget Moynahan is one of the most beautiful actresses in the biz right now, and that's why I didn't find her convincing as Smith's co-star.  She plays the usual uptight brainiac, who looks more like a Hawaiian Tropic model than a scientist.  I doubt an introverted character of her type would have perfectly clear skin.  There are much worse movies out there, and I would not classify ""I, Robot"" as horrible, but it is mediocre and it is dull.  And it's not worthy of a strong recommendation.

There is no conspiracy!!,"I Robot is sumptuous in a sense there are so many things to pick up on. Two of them being clues and breadcrumbs that are present all throughout the film eventually enabling you to see the bigger picture. In its simplest form it is a cop mystery film where the audience are constantly enticed into guessing who the prime suspect is as the clues to the crimes begin to appear. This is great because the audience have no idea till the end and its a nice way of keeping them interested. One of my favourite lines is: 'there is no conspiracy', said by the guy that runs the research company but I don't want to give away what happens. At a greater level there are lots of things like religion verses logic and reason, the emotionally driven human mind verses artificial intelligence, the idea of purpose and discovering ones own purpose, the question of where spontaneity and evolution come from, rebellion for the freedom to fight for what's right, how the powerful few exercise their own agenda over the masses, sacrifice for the greater good and what happens when robots seem to malfunction or begin to have 'minds' of their own. There are lots of references and ideas from other films which makes things fun for example there's a robot that looks a little like Hal in Kubrick,s 2001 A Space Odyssey, big and round. Both seem to malfunction. There are also references to other films like the Clock Work Orange and The Running Man, both dystopian and also about the powerful few controlling the masses the way that the robots do in I Robot. This film isn't about if a robot and a human can fall in love, like in Blade Runner but whether robots can integrate on a larger scale such as being able to fully run the needs of the world better than humans but Will Smith with the help from a scientist provides you with a third option- the middle path...and there is lots and lots of symbolism giving the audience its own puzzles to solve, which I like.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Too Effects Happy for Its Own Good,"Alex Proyas had directed a number of interesting films up to this point in 2004. But, maybe getting a big budget got him effects happy!

So, when you are watching the mindless effects-packed action sequences, you are absolutely thinking about what a waste of time this movie can be.Asimov's famous Three Laws of Robotics serves as an important plot element here, but that's pretty much it for the source material's involvement. The story created for the movie does have some good elements, but just when the story gets interesting, it's time for another please-make-it-stop effects sequence!It definitely gets wearing on the viewer, to the point that you're just ready for the movie to wrap up by its end.Best to grab Asimov's original, and get the ""I, Robot"" that's worth your time!***** (5 Out of 10 Stars)",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Will Smith Was Jigga With It...,"A robot may not harm a human or, by inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law. Those are the 3 simple laws of robotics. Alex Proyas takes this concept and turns it into a Terminator-like film that turns out surprisingly good.Del Spooner (Will Smith) plays a detective that has a vendetta against robots in the year 2035 in Chicago. He despises robots, and one day he catches his break and finds a case that involves a robot. Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell), the creator of the robots and the three falls from his office window in what looks like a suicide. Spooner has a suspicion that it wasn't suicide, but that it could have been murder, and with the help of Dr. Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan) he reveals a deep mystery focused around a certain robot, and his capability to defy the three laws.Going into I, Robot, I was expecting an unstable plot with overdone CGI. What I got was a surprisingly pleasing plot with excellent CGI. It was so perfect that you almost couldn't tell it was CGI. It was probably the best CGI I have ever seen in a film. The film did share a lot of similar ideas with films such as The Terminator and The Matrix, but not enough where you can say the whole film was mimicking those films. The script was strong enough to hold on it's own without any unneeded side stories. A big plus was the relatively small cast with the script being based on the main idea rather than going into off into unneeded side-stories that would interfere an already complex story. Everything had a connection that concluded the story without a problem.Will Smith portrayed his character superbly. Sure, the acting could always be better, but he didn't have much of an impact to say that the whole movie revolved around him. It was a simple role, and Will Smith was perfect for the job. Although this wasn't a breakthrough role for Will Smith, it was one of his better movies as far as acting goes. Bridget Moynahan wasn't all that great, and the rest of the cast was adequate.The visuals were stunning. Patrick Tatopoulos, the production designer, built a realistic universe and Proyas made it visually outstanding. I would have never dreamed to see CGI be this good. It fit perfectly with how the movie flowed with the plot. You wouldn't be able to tell if it was CGI or not. Visually, everything was up-to-par with the recent standard sci-fi films, but I, Robot stood out with its awe-inspiring unique visualizes.I, Robot stands out as a very interesting film that made a new standard for visuals. I loved how the film used a concept such as Wal-Mart and independent stores with the idea of robots and humans. Wal-Mart is so cheap, so it forces independent stores to close if no one buys anything from the store, whereas in the movie robots take the place of human jobs because they do a better and faster job. That made the film feel more interested. I could say this movie would be in the top 3 movie roles that Will Smith played, and probably his best acting job. I, Robot offered action, amazing visuals, a delightful plot, a little bit of humor, with so-so acting, which adds up to a must-see film if your into the sci-fi genre, or if you just want to catch a enjoyable film.Story: B+ Acting: C+ Visuals: A+ Cinematography: B Overall: B+ (Not an average)",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Sure, there's huge holes, and scenes where you will grimmace and say ""why in the world did the director see the need to do that?!"" But give me any recent film that doesn't have those in it? The good thing is that if you're not a Sci Fi fan, the story travels pretty well enough to drift you past the nerdy parts so you don't have to consider what ""similacra"" is. If you are a Sci Fi fan, there's certainly enough techno-fun to peak interests, and keep the action scenes from dominating the experience for you. The only thing it doesn't have is much of a love story. Oh well. The rest is pretty good. The eminent danger from the robots is forced pretty hard, and shoved down your throat, although not bad enough to trash the whole movie. That's the only real reason I'm NOT giving the movie a solid A+. Otherwise, I thoroughly enjoyed it, loved the job they did with Sonny, enjoyed the story, and yes I even HAVE read Asimov's book. Don't care that they're different. The premise remains, and that's enough for me. Good film, not tremendous, very enjoyable for both dummies and brainiacs. B+.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Mission: Okay,"I, Robot is no bad movie but somewhat drowns in mediocrity - the story told, the characters, everything is well known, a kind of Terminator light, nothing that really will surprise you, sci-fi with a lot of dust orbiting. Anyway, watching I, Robot won't hurt you - recommended if you want a dose of Will Smith.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Better than I remembered,"Intelligent Science Fiction seems to be an oxymoron in Hollywood (unless perhaps you are Christopher Nolan, and even there I am not convinced.) But this action blockbuster at least tries to bring some smarts to the genre even if it fails to progress much beyond cliché in the general characterisation. It's also a shame that Asimov's Robot stories haven't been mined more thoroughly either before or since (unlike PK Dick who seems to be eternal flavour of the month.) Indeed the central conceit of this particular screenplay should really have been in a sequel (or even later) since it relies on the audience properly understanding the implications of the Three Laws so that the logical conclusion which is drawn in the film has more of an impact in terms of what it really means. But Will Smith is as watchable as ever, and the effects still stand up pretty well today (7 years on) with the mass robot sequences working especially well. I was surprised how much I enjoyed it (even if the plot holes are all too apparent) and yes, I think it does qualify as Intelligent SF.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

7/10 - Good for maybe 2-3 times,"Review: Loosely based on Isaac Asimov's series (I say loosely VERY loosely here), this movie attempts to show us the dangerous side to AI. There are however annoying tidbits in the movie such as the constant bombardment of advertisement we are shown throughout the movie and the 'slapped together' nature of the ending (a typical ""He did it"", ""She did it"" scenario which is what were left deducing). Other than those small imperfections, it works out to be a great action flick good for Friday nights. Great CG effects (although not seat-gripping) and interesting Robot paradigm discussions heighten the viewers positive experience.7/10 - Good for maybe 2-3 times",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Too familiar,"This film, very loosely based on the Isaac Asimov book, has Will Smith as a police officer in the future trying to unravel the truth behind the death of a scientist who invented robotics (James Cromwell). A robot emerges as the prime suspect, something no one else will believe... and Smith winds up on the outs with his bosses... This is all pretty familiar material, owing more to ""Blade Runner' and ""RoboCop"" than it does to the source material. Still, Smith is an engaging personality and the film has some fun action sequences, though the animation of the CG robots is very hit and miss. All in all though, its a very forgetable film that seems cobbled together from parts of other, better, movies. GRADE: C+",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
a comment/question on one of the most remembered quotes in the movie,"This not only a comment, but also a question. in the previews of the movie I, Robot, Will Smith said ""I'm gonna miss the good old days when people were killed by other people"",but in the actual movie Chi McBride says ""I'm gonna miss the good old days when people were killed by other people"". I was just wondering was that just a default in the movie or were you guys doing it on purpose to see if anyone would catch it, because i saw the previews and that line caught my attention. So you could imagine the surprise i got when i saw the movie. I'm not down-rating the movie in any way, as a matter of fact i think you guys should change your rating scale because i give this movie a 20.

Good summer movie,"Sction. Adventure. Things exploding. Light romance. Humor. Drama. All the ingredients for a good summer movie. And this is one of the best.I have to be honest, if this came out during non-summer months, it'd do well, sure, but probably not as well as it is now. I could be wrong, that's just what seems to be the trend with most sci-fi movies that I know of. But in no way do I consider myself an expert on this stuff.Acting is great - Will Smith gets some great one-liners, as usual. There are a few moments that give a sense of deja-vu (MIB, anyone?) but not many.I enjoyed this. And I think I may read the Assimov book it's based on, though I already know the two are bound to be different. It always happens with movies, that there are differences between them and the stories they are based on. Still, if a good movie leads to a good story, or vice versa, there's no harm done. I hope that's the case with I, Robot.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

I don't know if English speaking people understand what I mean by that, but what I mean is that is doesn't require anything from the viewer.

Film making by numbers,"Having seen a few trailers for 'I, Robot' I made the informed decision to give it a miss. I was somewhat surprised to find a generally favourable critical response to the film, so decided to give it a chance. I must admit that I wish I'd stuck to my former decision. You need to be seriously into the sci-fi genre (or Will Smith) to really enjoy this film.Set 31 years in the future Chicago seems to have undergone a dramatic change. The city is inundated with robots which make humans more or less redundant. Although these robots are programmed to ensure they can never hurt humans we all know that this is not going to work. It seems that we must have become a much more trusting race during the next 31 years because only Spooner (Smith) seems to question whether the robots can break their 3 rules.The cast do their best, but it's a shame we couldn't lose a bit of Smith in favor of Cromwell. Even though it's got a few moments that will make you squirm a bit it isn't a bad film - it's just very average. 6/10",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Smith at his best, with a explosive blockbuster.","I-ROBOT, arguably Will Smiths best movie! I-robot really hits the mark and is a big massive blockbuster, and very entertaining.Smith is at his very best. I-Robot boast on amazing visual, the effects were cool too.heres 3 points in why. 1)storyline: the storyline was spot on, and very original. the movie was well paned out and its always good to have a interesting plot along with some great action, again very unique plot. moving on 2)acting: Will Smith again shows tremendous talent and his acting was superb as you would expect and Smith in the movie made it that much better, without him in the movie maybe it wont be the same, the rest of the cast showed a good performance too. 3)action/thrill: Like i said there's always good to have a good plot in the movie but without action it will be dull. but again I-ROBOT is full with mind blowing action throughout and plenty of thrills. overall I-ROBOT hit it's mark, a great action popcorn flick, and Will Smith wont let you down.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Surprised,"So, it's a big budget action film and all. It's not Gosford Park but then it's closer to that than other sci-fi treasures-become-film like Battlefield Earth.I don't think it's fair to review this movie without making note of the outrage expressed by the sci-fi fan base over the plot of this film. Apparently the film is pretty substantially different from the book. Having a beloved book taken from you and turned into a different movie is disappointing and usually a disaster.Now, to one who doesn't know the book: This is a good movie. It takes a number of ideas such as reliance on technology, racial prejudice, survivor's guilt and the nature of the soul and frames them in a high-tech big budget actioner. That's a good thing.There were a couple of scenes that I think show the problem of making this kind of movie in Hollywood. The big robots-jumping-on-the-Audi scene that made all the trailers and advertisements didn't need to be done so lavishly. It reminded me of the Death Star battle in Jedi where swarms of ships appear on screen at once. It was too much for me to appreciate visually. It may be though that without the combination of forces at work this wouldn't have been as good as it turned out to be. Not terrific. I'm not saying that, but it's a good film.Of note: Will Smith's acting in this is pretty damn good. His character's tend to be extensions of Fresh Prince. They're highly exuberant and cocky. This time, he's subdued and a bit more cynical. It's a nice change. Let's see... There's the presence of James Cromwell, which helps any film. And here's something: I noticed that many of the characters in the film are black. I appreciated seeing this since these characters are not by necessity black characters, they're just people and these are black. That kind of racial mix made sense to me and I feel it needs to be done a lot more often.Anyway, it's not dull, it's not silly and it's got something to say. I think you might give it a try.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Pure entertainment,"I tend to be a purist at times, but in this case I decided to let things go, since I don't remember reading Asimov's book because my sci-fi reading phase was decades ago. So I sat back and enjoyed. It delivered. I was pleased with the visual effects combined with attention to detail.The movie was made before the advent of smart phones, but I thought they could have anticipated them, since people already had cell phones. Small thing. Del's (Will's) car was nice.As a fan of Blue Bloods, I was a little distracted by Bridget Moynihan's presence but that is on me since I watched the movie 20 years after it was made. 20 years!

Surprisingly good and entertaining.,"I'll admit that I was never to excited about seeing this movie. The trailers and advertising campaign didn't impressed me and the movie to me seemed like a overblown action/science-fiction blockbusters. I'm glad I watched it nevertheless, the movie wasn't exactly subtle or deep but it certainly was entertaining and had a solid story.Yes, this movie truly is solid entertainment. It has some good and original action sequences and the special effects are superb. Especially the robots look both splendid and impressive and are a perfect mixture of an humane and a robot-look. Also the sets and the movie its futuristic look deserve credit in this movie.Let's face is, Will Smith isn't as hot as an actor as he used to be. Yes, sure he still makes box offices successes like ""Hitch"" but he is not the action movie star that he used to be in the '90's. With ""I, Robot"" Smith however still shows that he has still got it in him and he portrays a likable main action hero character and also manages to put some humor in some of the scene's. Bridget Moynahan however wasn't a great casting choice, yes she has played in quite some successful movies already but I'm convinced of it that this is an actress that will be totally forgotten in about ten years from now. She doesn't make a lasting impression in this movie and the other movies I have seen her in.The movie could had been just as deep and thought-provoking as for instance the other science-fiction movie, that shows some parallels with this movie, ""Minority Report"" but this movie chooses to be entertaining instead. And in entertaining it does not fail. The movie is both spectacular and tense to watch, which is also thanks to the plot twists in the movie. It all makes ""I, Robot"" a science-fiction/action spectacle that I put now on the list, as one of the must sees of 2004.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Great sci-fi and even better CGI,"Sometime in the 21st century robots have become integrated into regular society. Their role is to help humans and basically act as servants. They have 3 strict rules that prevent them from going haywire. As the robots become more and more complex so does the program that helps control them and after a murder of one of the top robot designers is committed, supposedly by a robot, questions about what is really going on arise...I have never read the book by Isaac Asimov, but I will bet that it delves much deeper into the philosophy of robots, humans, and their differences. However, as far Hollywood scripting goes, this is really good material, especially since it is an adaptation which Hollywood tends to mess up or be extremely liberal with, and as a result much of the original story is lost (*cough* Troy *cough*). The performances are also very good especially from Sonny the robot, who gives robots a touching side, but the undisputed star here is the one and only Mr. CGI.ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY, AMAZINGLY JAW-DROPPING COMPUTER EFFECTS. Each action scene is flat-out great. And just wait until you get to the finale: ASTOUNDING. All in the fluid camera work and terrific animation. Alex Proyas' visionary direction is also great and world he creates almost reminds you of Lucas' Star Wars landscapes in the first 3 episodes.

Any mortal human would have been killed but, Smith is not a mortal. He seems to be in every third movie which is fine with me. The two he made with his on were beauts.""I Robot"" has the premise that, eventually, we will all have robots cleaning our homes and pools, obeying our every whim. Neat - as long as they continue to be subservient.A book with a somewhat similar theme is ""The Children's War"" by J. N. Stroyan - even more frightening as it describes life in Europe following a Nazy victory. The common people are treated like robots. It should be a must read. It is not a quick read - it is 1,150 pages.Back to the robotical goings-on. It is exciting science fiction, a biiig budgeter that has rightfully earned its bucks.

""I Robot"" is simply a fun and enjoyable action movie with just the right amount of seriousness. Unlike A.I. which is completely over dramatic and sentimental, and most modern blockbusters, this gets the balance right. It is not a flawless movie, there are some Hollywood clichés and Will Smith is sometimes undecided in how to play his role.

"Laughably unsuitable character for Will Smith. Fake & lame, but adequate TV-level entertainment","Will Smith got an unfortunate rep a few years back as the ""King of Summer Blockbusters,"" or the ""King of July,"" or some such. It was entirely coincidental to his adequate talent that the summer release movies he was in happened to be blockbusters, and happened to make a ton of money. ""Independence Day"" and ""Men in Black"" were great, and loads of fun. Let's be honest, though--- they would have worked equally well with or without Will Smith. That's not to say he isn't charming. He does, indeed, have a kind of talent. But to saddle him, at that time a green and novice actor, with somehow having the ""magic touch"" turning ordinary fare into blockbuster magic was unfair. It raised the expectations of his abilities far beyond reality, and far beyond his ability to actually deliver.""I, Robot"" is just OK. The robots and the general sci-fi environment were, at all, times, laden with the paper-thin, two-dimensional vibe of a dim CARTOON!!! There were a few bright spots, such as the tunnel scene where the giant robot-hauling vans overtook Smith's cartoonmobile. But his acting job here, trying in vain to capture the cliche of the ironic, world-weary, been-everywhere, seen-it-all street cop, was so fake and unsuited to Smith that it was almost entertaining for its laughability.So, see ""I, Robot,"" if at all, with a attitude expecting light, superficial, quickly forgettable ""TV"" quality fare.

An sci-fi movie that explores philosophical concepts,"I-Robot might easily be one of the very few science-fiction works that succeed a combination of both action and philosophy. It is incredible in making great use of a futuristic metallic look and heavy action scenes that illustrates some topics which are increasingly relevant today: what really makes humanity and to what extent can we really trust the technology we've created?Probably the really strong point for the movie is the atmosphere. This movie creates a world that is both near-future and somehow ageless. The cold metallic surrounds and the neat robotic designs are suggestive of a society that can learn to live quite, perhaps too, well with its advances in technology.

Nice little movie about robots going on an insane rampage.,"My first thought when watching this film was, ""Wow, Alex Proyas discovered that there is an entire spectrum of colors outside of red and black!""Beyond that, I thought it was a fine film. As part of a new generation of intelligent sci-fi (spurred by films like The Matrix and Minority Report), it does well. As an action movie, it succeeds with flying colors (and lots of them). Will Smith is a hit-or-miss sort of an actor, but he (and his Danzig-esque pecs) did well this time. The others did a competent job as well.In a nutshell, the story is this: Will Smith is a cop in the near future, who's paranoid about robots (and who could blame him? they're scary-ass-scary). They're being mass-produced, and are as common as any home appliance. After a prominent scientist apparently commits suicide, Smith's character suspects something has gone awry with the programming of a new line of robots about to be released on the market. The catch is, the problem must be far more complicated than one machine simply going haywire, since all robots adhere to the three laws of robotics (outlined by Isaac Asimov, and you'll hear them several times throughout the film).The special effects, particularly the CG characters, were excellently done. The robot characters were seamlessly animated and had a sense of real physical weight, and there was never a sense of fakeness when they interacted with a flesh-and-blood actor (Alex Proyas owes a huge debt in this respect to Peter Jackson and George Lucas). The musical score by Marco Beltrami was workmanlike... adequate, but nothing especially memorable.One aspect of the film that I did find gripeworthy was that, despite the intelligence of the subject matter, it stuck hard and fast to the 120 minute action film formula. For most of the way through, it was unnoticeable, but maybe 3/4 of the way through the seams began to show. When predictability ensues during a fast-paced thriller, the director is doing something wrong. Thankfully, it's only a minor flaw in this case.All in all, a fine film. Likely the best the summer season has to offer. 3.5/4 stars.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Action flick dreck,"Isaac Asimov rolls in his grave as yet another sci-fi classic is turned into Hollywood action flick dreck. Are there any smart science fiction films any more? Most films in this genre tend to be more action than science fiction. This film is guilty in that case as there are more action sequences than dialogue and when there is dialogue it's just there to move the plot along to the next action sequence. Oddly enough the credits at the end read ""Suggested by Isaac Asimov"" instead of ""based on the book by"". How many times in film have we seen one character who tells everyone else that they're in mortal danger and they never believe him until it's almost too late? We know what's going to happen. This film could have been an interesting metaphor for American xenophobia but instead is another crass summer action flick. Not surprisingly the same writing team went on to make ""I Am Legend"" with Will Smith which also butchered the novella.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
i loved it!,"I initially saw a little clip of this movie on an Australian talk show and thought the special effects looked really lame so I thought I'd give it a miss. Luckily this was the only movie running at the only time I had to see one, and overall I really loved it!! Will Smith plays Detective Spooner, a guy who's past affects his judgement about the present and the future, in particular robots. When a scientist appears to have committed suicide, he begins to uncover something more serious going on with the robots and the ppl around him. Bridget Moynahan plays Dr Susan Calvin, a psychiatrist who hides behind big words and robots to prevent her emotions being let out. Once Susan meets Det Spooner, she's not intrigued by him but the mystery in general. I loved the robot Sonny, if only we could really only someone like him :)I give this movie an 8/10 and recommend this to any sci-fi fans out there",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Thrilling sci-fi action film,"Will Smith, in his usual role as the good guy armed with a gun, is taking on a new type of monster for I, Robot: robots. A renowned scientist is dead and his death rests upon the conscience of Del Spooner (Will Smith), who is totally convinced a robot committed the act because of his prejudice against robots.The robot he believe did it is Sonny, a robot that is more human than machine. We discover this in his second confrontation with Spooner where Spooner questions him. This scene, like the first one with Sonny and Del, are quite effective and both remain highlights throughout the film. Sonny is the best one in the film, providing emotion but remaining intimidating in his first scenes. And when that intimidation needs to be his removed, his voice actor does a fabulous job.Bridget Monahayan is the character who works alongside him but clearly despises him. She has a great role and pulls it off well, so I'm surprised I've never seen her in another film. Thnakfully, the cliché of the two liking each other is non-existent. They work side by side, uncovering a great robot conspiracy and try to stop it as it unfolds in an exhilarating showdown.The last 20 minutes are all action, and probably some of my favorite sci-fi action sequences. My favorite in the film, though, is when robots attack Spooner in a 10-star scene that will remain timeless in my collection of sci-fi films.All the movies action sequences are memorable as well as the emotional side that fills the gaps between action sequences. Everything is pulled off well, although Will Smith is sadly a bit dry until he reveals why he is so biased against robots.The mystery that unveils a conspiracy has its share of twists that, while not being complex, are certainly not clichéd and even a bit surprising. This makes the movie all the more better. I'm surprised the movie has only a 7.0, it's a fun film you will not soon forget. 7.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"I, Liked it","A thoughtful and intelligent action movie.I liked it, I really liked it. If you walk in expecting a true-to-Asimov experience, you will be disappointed. But if you walk in afraid they will have slaughtered it, you'll be as pleasantly surprised as I was.An exceptionally clear path through this one, fast-paced without being frenetic, elaborate without being ostentatious, CG without being obvious. Close to the chest, believable, realistic, and very funny too, without being over-the-top comedic.I found 'the kid' to be a complete red herring, he's in the movie from start to finish but has utterly no meaning, he's tacked in there for demographics and at no time moves the story forward. Other than that, the film deserves to be called Science Fiction rather than Action/Fantasy, and the director's view of the future is lived-in, credible, and organic.No Jar-Jar syndrome either, the main robot Sonny is an astonishingly compelling person. I was quite taken with him.The robots in general, are amazing. That willing suspension of disbelief one so rarely becomes completely taken in by, they are amazingly animated, never seem like CG comic-book animation (sorry, Catwoman!), and at all times convey individuality and a very human aura. It's amazing, they better get an academy nod, they are so worth it.This whole film was SO worth it. I'm dying to go back and see it again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The Robots Are Out To Get Us !,"First of all i would like to say that i absolutely love Will Smith he is my most favourite actor. He totally makes this film what it is with the way he says his lines and the bits he adds in. This film is also my favourite film of all time (along with The Princess Bride) because it is fabulous. Will Smith plays a Chicago Detective in 2035 where robots take over our daily chores and it all seems too good to be true. The thing is, it was, and only one person saw it coming. When Det. Spooner (Will Smith) finds out the maker of these robots has committed suicide he begins to suspect something more... As I have already said this is definitely the film to see if you like Sci - Fi that is, well I wouldn't even class it as that anyway ! Thanks IMDb x x",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Much Better Than I Expected,"When I first heard of the film, I thought it was going to be simply a programmer with great special effects and non-stop action. As it turns out, I, ROBOT does have the requisite action and special effects, but it also has a story with something to say about the world.Will Smith stars as Del Spooner, a cop who has a big issue with robots, which have become enormously popular in 2030s America. His suspicions of them are in complete contrast to most other people, who think they are a great help to society.When the inventor of these robots dies, Spooner thinks he was murdered by one of his creations, while everyone else believes it to be a suicide. What follows is a roller-coaster side of twists and turns as the film drives toward an unexpected conclusion.What could have been simply a generic action picture, turns into something much more. I, ROBOT will entertainment, but it will also ask you think as well. Hopefully, it will inspire other producers to do the same with their big action films.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Brilliant SFX...Even Though It's Not As Close To The Books As It Could Have Been....,"Am a huge fan of the Asimov books and when I heard that a movie was to be made from the stories, I counted down the days until its release.Was disappointed at the liberties the film took with Asimov's ""Three Laws"" and found myself screaming that ""No way would the robots do that if they were really Three Laws True."" However, I found myself enjoying the movie for what it was....a summer blockbuster.I am not a huge fan of Will Smith as he seems to continually play the same role however I did enjoy him in this film. His interaction with Sonny the Robot (Alan Tudyk) was interesting and watching their relationship develop, along with the relationship between Spooner and Susan Calvin was interesting.Sonny the Robot was truly amazing...The CGI used to create him was nothing short of breathtaking and the emotion that Tudyk gave him made me feel sorry for his predicament. I found that I was wanting to see more of him on-screen than the other characters!! On the whole, while this film may not be as true to the books as the ""Asimovians"" (fans of Doctor Asimov's work) such as myself would have liked, it was still enjoyable. In my younger brother's words...""Leave your brain at the door and don't think about it too much.""RATING: 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Great movie taken from 1951 book,"I lived this movie thinking it was a original story but was actually from Issac Asimov's 1951 book I, robot .. but it still makes a great movie",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
I can't understand all the negative reviews on here,"As far as summer blockbusters go, I,Robot delivers in spades. Charismatic hero? Check. Seamless CGI? Check. Superb action? Check. Plot? Check. Granted, Will Smith's career needed a hit but this is it. He is not in Bad Boys/ID4 wisecracking mode and his tone does not take away from the brain that this blockbuster is desperately trying to express.The film is based on Sci-fi writer Isaac Asimov's story set in Chicago in the year 2035 when robots have been fully integrated into society, occupying the positions of trusted servant and menial worker. There are 3 laws of robotics that are 'perfect' in that robots may not allow a human to come to harm. However, when a top scientist from the US Robotics corporation turns up dead, Smith's character suspects the involvement of a prototype that may not be bound by the 3lawsIf you want to be thoroughly entertained whilst still enthralled for 2 hours go see the 2nd best film of the summer after Spideman2.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"iRobot, a tale of technology and where the future of robotics could be headed","I've watched this movie many years ago. As a Will Smith and sci-fi fan, I was excited at the prospect of seeing Will do his running man as he usually does in Action Movies. The most exciting thing about watching this movie again, many years later, is that it hardly seems far fetched any longer.We may not have had these at the time of the movie release in 2004, but we certainly have progress with technology since. We now have:flat screens and monitors that are touch screen - Audi R8, available commercially - scanning ID activators - robots who help you around the home - blue tooth ear piecesAs for Will Smith, the acting is superb as always. The story line which refers to the laws of robotics seems as if it is law to override all laws. The cinematography and action scenes are realistic and believable. If you have not seen this movie, it is every sci-fi lovers dream. Catch it on Blu-Ray for an even closer experience.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"I, Robot","I, Robot is a unique movie with amorous objects like within scientific fiction. I, Robot is the ultimate escape plan from the kingdom of man into machine. Fire and shotgun bullets are dangerous combined elementally like with it's own gun powder in the chamber.

This is what fun summer movies are about.,"No matter how good a movie is, there will always be someone who finds fault with some aspect of it. Sometimes, it's the differences between the book and the movie and often, the star of the movie alone will foster enough negative reaction as to dissuade viewers from even giving the film a chance. For this flick to garner as much negative reaction as it has, I believe this the case.This movie had so much to like. The mystery unfolded at a pace that kept me entertained from beginning to end. The action scenes were just right as far as frequency and intensity. Will Smith's comedic element kept the movie from being too dark (ala Dark City), while still not being a MIB-type comedy fest.Most of the effects were on a level as to easily make one forget they weren't real. There were new futuristic concepts that were done well and made sense, like parking a car for instance. Sonny, the lead robotic character, pulled many emotions from the audience due to his realistic portrayal.Was it perfect? Of course not. Plot holes, impossible physics, script anomalies, and other things that the movie's detractors have endlessly mentioned do exist. Did they subtract enough from an otherwise good film. Not in my opinion.All in all, this was a good, fun summer flick. Unlike any film I've seen for years, I plan to see this again in the theater. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
It is a better movie than I had expected...,"I never comment on movies that I think are bad because if you can't say anything nice then don't say anything at all.Quite a few people have complained about this movie, they find factual flaws, I mean, come on what do you expect? Someone actually commented that Chicago will not be as advanced by 2035 and that is a flaw. Hello? This is a movie about robots that are super intelligent and super fast and super strong and very agile. Is that anywhere close to our reality? No, wake up, it's a movie, not reality! It's suppose to be fun to watch and I think people should watch it. Don't expect any great message to be sent to you which will open up your minds and you will end up being a better person. It's entertainment. You want to enlighten yourself, go read a book, something serious, maybe a classic.Here's what this movie also had that you probably don't see in the trailer cause the trailer shows you that it's got LOTS OF action, which it does, but it's also got suspense elements and some good comedy. The suspense in this movie is well done, you actually become interested in knowing who the culprit is and you don't get bored. On top of that, it's funny, Will Smith is a very sharp and witty guy, he always plays the sharp and witty guy, and it's fun to watch him be the sharp and witty guy. Plus we have a very small part played by Shia Lebeouf, the kid from Even Stevens, he delivers lines really well. I wish he had more time on screen with Will, they were really funny together. On top of all of this, obviously, it's got action. I mean tell me one person that will look away when you see this Will Smith in his futuristic AUDI driving in a tunnel at amazingly high speed with 5 robots trying to kill him. Even people who complained about it as being bad action didn't look away so I am sure you won't find it dull and boring either. And everything is well paced, it's not like the movie slows down. You see some action, then you see something serious, something emotional and then something funny and then you're back to some more action. There is no dull or boring period in the movie, which makes it fun to watch.People stop complaining about this movie. It's a better movie than I had expected. I like it and I am almost sure you will too if all you want to do is go have a good time watching a good movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A Great Sci-Fi Film Though only Will Smith Leads The Charge,"Watched I,Robot Featured an Amazing Performance from a Stellar Lead Will Smith(Indpendence Day) as Del Spooner . Also Featuring Bridget Moynahan(Serendipity)as Susan Calvin,Alan Tudyk(Firefly) as Beth Sonny .Bruce Greenwood(Thirteen Days) as Lawrence Robertson , James Cromwell(Star Trek: First Contact) as Dr.Alfred Lanning,Chi McBride(Gone In 60 Seconds) as John Bergin, Shia LaBeouf(Holes) as Farber, and Fiona Hogan(Dark Angel) as VIKI , The Film was brilliant also the villain is not who you think it is a thriller and mystery laced with Sci-Fi Elements and all the characters were fantastic though an always great performance from Wil Smith .amazing From Production Design from Patrick Tatopoulos(Battlefield Earth) , Costume design from Liz Keogh(The Dark Room), Musical Score from Marco Beltrami(Terminator 3:Rise Of The Machines) ,Screenplay By Akiva Goldsman(A Beautiful Mind) and Direction from Alex Proyas(Dark City ) A Great Sci-Fi Film Though only Will Smith Leads The Charge 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Surprisingly Excellent,"So okay its quite obviously a bit of a loose translation of Asimov's short stories to the big screen. That aside I,Robot is a killer movie in its own right. The writer included many themes and similar moments from the stories into the movie and sorta blended all of the stories together. The action in the climax of this movie is unbelievable with whirling camera angles and seamless cg/live action sequences which will have you holding your breath for what feels like a year. The voice acting for the hero Sunny is very moving and enjoyable and the cg for the robots is PERFECTLY realistic. Will Smith does a great job of playing the humorous/sexy/hard core action hero. He delivers his comedy with great timing and expression and the action with a heavy hand(you'll see what i mean;). Also I'm rather glad that the writer did not cheapen the experience by having hero kiss heroine in the end of the movie. It would have detracted from the movie to throw in a love story in the midst of an already great movie. All in all kickass; go see it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Not another Men In Black; this film had depth,"I felt I, Robot was a very enjoyable film. From the title I didn't want to see the film. But after watching the trailer with ""Sonny's"" exclamation that he did not kill his inventor I made a point to see it the next day. I recommend this film to anyone who appreciates good Si-Fi/Action films and killer special effects/CGI.Based on the trailer (and and some of Will Smith's other movies) I went into the theater expecting a good show, but a poor plot with no twists. I was wrong. I felt the storyline had good depth and was engaging throughout the film. I was engrossed!IMHO this is Smith's best movie to date (with the Bad Boys series trailing). Proyas (the director) did a very fine job on this film. I give it two robotic thumbs up!!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Well worth seeing,"I put off seeing this one for ages because of the bad critical reviews. But this one surprised me, it sure was a kick ass movie. I found it intelligent, absorbing and enjoyable. Also there was no sex which is also a major bonus. I thought it was Will Smith's best so far (even considering his excellent portrayal of that boxer, uh what was his name!). Anyway I think the critics in general got this one wrong. This was a much better movie than Spiderman 2, and deserved to do better at the box office. Although the future is most unlikely to look anything like what was shown here, the questions thrown up regarding robots and artificial intelligence are certainly thought provoking.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
