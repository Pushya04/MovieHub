Eight out of ten stars!,"I must say, I was worried about this one. Catching Fire is my favorite book of the trilogy, but cinematically it makes absolutely no sense. The Hunger Games reads like a screenplay--Catching Fire is a meandery epic full of worldbuilding and exposition for a war that won't even begin until Mockingjay. So I was pleasantly surprised to find that this installment of the hit franchise, directed by industry rookie Francis Lawrence, was maybe even more engaging than its predecessor.Visually, it is a feat. The attention to detail is remarkable. Lawrence, along with screenwriters Michael Hardt and Suzanne Collins herself, manages to weave in all of the necessary set up to the upcoming war against The Capitol without it feeling tedious or heavy-handed. The new additions to the cast, most notably Philip Seymor Hoffman's Plutarch Heavensbee and Sam Claflin's Finnick O'Dair, are excellent, and the dialogue is much less wooden than, forgive me, the dialogue in the books sometimes is. Moreover, it is impressive that even with so many new people and so many moving parts, the central thread of Rebellion shines through.Of course, with so much plot, so much to set up, one can hardly blame Catching Fire for falling short in the emotional department--as is, it clocks in at 2 hours and 26 minutes--but I did find myself wanting some steamier Peeta/Katniss action. I was disappointed by Lawrence's apparent disregard for the relationship between Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence, no relation) and Peeta (the incomparable Josh Hutcherson). To me, Catching Fire is about Peeta. It's the Peeta show.Here's the thing: Katniss is supposed to be conflicted, not indifferent about Peeta. In the paper version, the reader, and by extension Katniss herself, feels truly torn between Gale and Peeta. She can't help but slowly fall in love with Peeta, who is so charming and funny and relentlessly Good. In this iteration, Katniss and Peeta have little to no chemistry, and Peeta only speaks when it is necessary to move the plot forward. Gale, on the other hand, is 6'4 and literally a Hemsworth. That he is a Hemsworth is no one's fault, I guess, but maybe Peeta should have been allowed to say some of the cute stuff he says in the books.The ""adults"" in the cast--Woody Harrelson's Haymitch and Donald Sutherland's President Snow have much meatier roles than they do in the books. To their credit, they are fantastic. But I can't help but wonder how much more potent this movie could have been if Lawrence had trusted his young stars a bit more with the emotional heavy lifting.Though it fell a bit short of exceptional, Catching Fire is by no means a Sophomore Slump, and I look forward to watching Mockingjay Part 1 on the big screen when it comes out!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Best in the series,"I think this instalment was the best movie in the series. It has the perfect balance of action and storyline. It expands the world with more backstory and characters, and the effects were better so it was more convincing and we felt like we were part of this world.

"This movie is long, but it doesn't feel watered down or stretched out","From the acting to the sets to the special effects, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is an exceptional film. This movie is long, but it doesn't feel watered down or stretched out - there is plenty of story and action to fill the time. Plus, Jennifer Lawrence doesn't have to carry the movie on her own. The supporting cast does an excellent job, as well. This film can't really stand on its own, but it's still a fun ride and a well-done adaptation of the book.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
The Definition of a Good Sequel,"Ever since I first saw it in theaters, Catching Fire has been one of my favorite movies of all time. It's so much better than the first one. It explores the story's political conflict more deeply and greatly expands on the dystopian universe.The new director gives it a fresh and improved vision. The first one had audiences criticizing the shaky and desaturated camerawork and this sequel fixed it. Even though one this movie involves Katniss and Peeta competing in the games again, it never feels like a repeat of the first one. They understand that viewers already know how the games work and take advantage of the chance to explore new concepts with it.Catching Fire should be an example to all filmmakers of how to do a good sequel.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
How to Do a Sequel Right,"There are two types of sequels. On one side you have The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and The The Dark Knight (2008), and on the other you have Jaws II (1978) and Terminator Genysis (2015). Thankfully, Catching Fire falls squarely in the first category. After an exciting, if not entirely fleshed out, first film, Catching Fire delivers on all the promises of intense action, compelling and intriguing story-line and dynamic relationships between the characters that we were all waiting for. The Hunger Games is a series which, conceptually, deserves a well put-together film series. It is a fun and interesting concept which matures with the audience from a usual action-filled romp into a political thriller which can inspire almost anyone. We got what we needed thanks to this wonderful sequel.In the first film, one of the key issues was the pacing. Many things felled rushed, especially the backstory for the characters which was more or less only seen in brief flashbacks and allusions. The lead up to The Games felt like a formality that they needed to get through so they could show us the action. This is understandable. Everyone wants to see people fighting, not sappy emotional moments from characters we don't even know yet. In Catching Fire, we get a much more fluid arc which gives us the perfect amount of set-up before dropping us into the second installment of The Games, which now have considerably more meaning than just staying alive. In some ways, it is allowed to because now we are familiar with the premises and characters, but the film goes beyond that to an extra level.Take for example the character of President Snow. In the first film, we get only fleeting glimpses of this menacing character (which, I should add, does mimic the books). In the novel, this is okay because it's from Katniss' point of view. In the film, we need an antagonist, and Donald Sutherland puts on a menacing performance in this role. In Catching Fire, we get to see that in its full development. Snow is at the same time fatherly and forbidding, gentle but powerful. He has that same appeal as Emperor Palpatine or Xerxes, ones who have no accountability and all the power and thus are beholden to no law or morality but their own. This comes through perfectly thanks to the phenomenal acting and fitting script.At the end of the day though, we get out of the house and go to the theater for a movie like this because we want to see action. It's not shameful to want to see a bit of blood and battling every now and then. Well, let's just say we are not left disappointed. The Games have taken on a whole new life in this installment, and it feels that way. In the first film, The Games are nearly quaint. It is just a simple scenario for the combatants to do what they will, free mostly from egregious deus ex situations. Primitive and effective. In the sequel, it doesn't just seem like person against person, but instead the heroes versus the machine. It is the spark of the rebellion even before it is fully revealed to us. There are enough tricks and surprises of The Games to keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time, wondering how our protagonists will get out of this one.Predictability is something that a film can suffer or thrive on. Have too much and your audience becomes bored, but too little and you risk raising the brow too high and going over too many heads. Catching Fire seems to find that perfect balance. I found myself often saying ""Ah, I know what's going to happen here."" and nearly immediately having it happen. I am not saying that as if I have some clairvoyant ability. What this film does it set the scenes up so tightly that you are rewarded for making guesses and allowed to feel like you've won by seeing the action in advance. It is not a cheap tactic either. They hit the mark here by giving you enough to work with but still leaving room for you to be excited and cheer when Katniss does the right thing. At the end, we are given enough of a cliffhanger leave us wanting more from the next sequel.Catching Fire is what sequels should strive to be. It didn't fall into any of the traps of a well-known series with a good original. It took what made the books and the original great and built on them. It helps that the actors seem to feel natural in their roles and with each other, likely the product of much more time working together. A perfect mix of action, thrills, mystery and socio-political drama, Catching Fire is simply altogether a great film. With this trend in the series, I am excited to see what Mockingjay has in store for me.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
It's Not Battle Royale Because It's Not Supposed To Be,"An earlier reviewer compared this to the Japanese cult favorite Battle Royale and decided it was almost junk. I beg to differ - the film needs to be evaluated on its own merits and its own story. Battle Royale is a single story about merciless, wanton and senseless violence and depravity when the aim was simply to be the last to survive - a kill- fest, where the innovative ways of killing serve to shock and titillate the audience but do little for the plot. The Hunger Games however, is about oppression, fighting back and revolution. The Games, though pivotal, are still part of a larger story.Compared to the first film, this one is definitely darker. The characters look even more despondent than ever, and if you thought there were few laughs in the first film, there is practically none in this. Even the brightly-lit scenes featuring cheering crowds and smiling hosts seemed dim, bleak and depressing. While enjoying the witty banter, you couldn't help but wait for the 'but...'. The feeling of doom and gloom persists from the start to the end of the film. It is not a bad thing though - it is not supposed to be a happy movie.Many details and subplots were understandably cut from the film adaptation, but none that were critical to the plot of the film. However, a lot of the peripheral action that were in the book is missing here, hence, though the story moves quickly enough, there is always the feeling that for an action-thriller, there aren't enough fights or explosions. The ones they movie do have aren't exciting or grand enough.But in terms of story-telling, the movie still works to move from the first film and prepare for the third. The seeds of revolution have been planted and watered, and we now prepare for the maturing and harvesting.Jennifer Lawrence didn't do as well here as in the last film, probably because most of the growing needed has been done previously. Josh Hutcherson though, put in a better performance. While he may previously be the injured lovestruck puppy dog, his maturing into a more complex character in this movie means he starts carrying more of the film.Emotionally, this movie affected me less than the last one. Maybe it's partly because I know what is coming, but that accounts for a very minor percentage. Mostly it's because the film is unable to engage your baser emotions - nothing that truly tugs at your heartstrings. The pervading gloom also seems to have sapped any ability to feel more despondent than you think you already are.It is still a movie that can be enjoyed though, and I did enjoy it enough. Hopefully the next film will provide for more emotional variance. If you don't feel for the characters, you won't care about the film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
This one stands above the others.,"Fearing an uprising over Katniss and Peeta's success at The Hunger Games, he changed the rules for the upcoming 75th games, the pair are right back inside the deadly games, only this time, the competition is much tougher.With the release of the new film just around the corner, I wanted to revisit them all, my feelings haven't changed, I still think that this is the best of the lot so far, I think it's better than the original film.I think it's a little slow to start, the impression you get early on is that it's an in depth look at life for Katniss and Peeta after the games, but when the twist comes, the film really does open up.It's not overlong, I'm glad they didn't push it out any further.There are some exciting sequences, these games really do provide a few thrills.Jennifer Lawrence is excellent as Katniss, her performance for me is superior to her previous one, she's excellent, as are Philip Seymour Hoffman and Donald Sutherland. Toby Jones, still doesn't work for me here.Best of the lot for me.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Much better than the original,"The original Hunger Games left me feeling empty and unsatisfied. It lacked depth and substance. I almost skipped Catching Fire because of it but I'm glad I didn't.Catching Fire has several things going for it that the original didn't.1) A Great Bad Guy: Although Donald Sutherland was in the original his character was more of a token villain and the focus was on the rival contestants. In Catching Fire, we have a great bad guy that the audience can love to hate. There's real conflict and tension between Katniss and the President and this serves as a great foundation on which to base the film.2) Excellent Conflict: The root of any drama is conflict and this has a lot of it. I loved the conversation between Katniss and the President in the early part of the film that sets the stage for the rest of the movie. Two opposing forces who hate each other but must tolerate the others' existence while secretly plotting ways to either eliminate or mitigate the threat the other poses. A cunning game of cat and mouse ensues as they engage in a battle of wits.3) Interesting Characters: The relationship between Katniss and Peeta is complicated and interesting to watch as it develops on screen. Haymitch, the most interesting character from the original, continues to be entertaining. There are a lot of undeveloped characters in this film that I would have liked to have known more about (for example, Nuts and Bolts) but I am satisfied with the level of character development in this film.4) Emotional Appeal: Although the actual hunger games portion of the movie is devoid of emotion, much like its predecessor, the rest of the film manages to engage your feelings. Katniss & Peeta's visit to the other districts to pay respect to the fallen tributes was interesting. Katniss' insistence on Peeta's protection and survival was believable. Her emotional breakdown in the end was quite stirring. I was surprised the film was able to achieve this connection with the audience.All in all, this is one of those rare instances where the sequel is better than the original. That doesn't happen very often.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Getting Things Right,"We are now at the post Twilight/Harry Potter era, and The Hunger Games movies are the only young adult novel adaptations that have the same scale of fame of the two former series. And you know that the YA genre has become even worse nowadays; just pick up a random book, mix them with familiar elements that would please teenager hormones, and good to go. But Catching Fire is obviously different, and these are the reasons why it's much superior compared to those horrible drecks: it has strong ambition, it digs deeper within its themes, and simply tells a story. Thus it finally gets it right by deliberately showed all the interesting parts of the source material.Everyone will most likely come for the action and the romance, but unlike the last film, this one has a wiser focus: sociopolitical satires. It explores how tyrannical the Capitol government is, and how the media amazingly helps covering their corruption. The context alone is of course immediately compelling, it makes a stirring conviction why they really need to go for a revolution. While it centers Katniss who has issues of her own, her compassion towards her family, friends, and the people of Panem has always felt genuine. Those kinds of emotions work remarkably than the love triangle she's stuck into.The film once again benefits having Jennifer Lawrence in the lead. She's just incredibly engaging, that you would definitely root for all throughout. The rest of the cast remains as compelling as they were, same goes to the new ones somewhat. Francis Lawrence now handles the series. The camera may be less shaky, but there's always a sense of art in his direction, especially at the midst of silence. The pacing is effortlessly outstanding, which decently balances the drama and the thrills. The games has become a lot electrifying, it is more practical and have greater effect of danger than just characters trying to kill each other. It's a creative turn that goes full momentous until the end. The production and the effects are solid enough to make the exteriors of their world look intriguing.The Hunger Games: Catching Fire has a smarter vision and finally hits the right note. The first movie was entertaining, but it hardly bothers showing the actual point of these stories other than enjoying how the games were played. This sequel filled the blanks around the setting thus tells a far more interesting story. And it sure feels like an utter miracle for an awful year for YA films, then again a great young adult book adaptations have always been rare. Overall, it's easily the best one this year, and that is all what you need to know for a while since it's kind of hard talking about it without giving much away. I can't say it's flawless, but it is generally engrossing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Let the flames begin...,"I was lucky enough to be able to watch the movie one week early, since it opened here in Brazil one week before the release in the US, and I must tell you this fellow The Hunger Games fans, even though my English is not even that good: Catching Fire is a GREAT experience, and one that improves over the first film in nearly every possible level.When I first read the books, I thought that they were not only incredibly addicting and fun, but also with an important message for the youngsters (and every other person, age is not important) who read it, and that made it different from some of the other uninteresting YA books around. I really liked the trilogy, and when I watched the first adaptation, I was disappointed with some aspects and routes they went with it. It was not an horrible movie, at all, but it was not very faithful to the book and lacked the impact I found in the novel.With that in mind, I kept my excitement in close watch with Catching Fire and went expecting a good movie and nothing more. I was welcomed with an excellent surprise: the movie followed the events of the novel whenever possible and brilliantly so, while managing to keep me on the edge of my seat, even though I knew what was going to happen the entire time.I won't go into details about the plot of the movie, some fellow reviewers already did it probably better than I'll ever do and the chances you're familiar with it are high. So I'll go right into the review and my opinions on the picture.Francis Lawrence was nothing short of an excellent choice for the director's chair: gone are the shaky camera action (one of my major problems with the first film) and welcome are thrilling and pumping action scenes that expertly convey the tension and ferocity of the moment. He managed to keep the violence and shock without ever crossing the line, and whoever read the books know how important this is; it's part of the plot, of the criticism and one of the main elements that make the whole point of the film. He keeps you interested and invested in the story even when nothing bombastic is happening, and that is a great achievement, something that really sets this sequel apart.But Francis is not alone on making this movie special. His young and talented cast, lead by the always amazing Jennifer Lawrence, is ferocious and eager to invest in their characters, making you an ally (or an enemy) while watching everything unfold. Lawrence shows us again why she was the perfect choice to play the now iconic Katniss Everdeen: she makes you root for this young, brave lady every single minute of the struggle; with her sad, hopeless stare that pierces your soul to her ability to convey admirable strength when everything seems to be out of reach are phenomenal and she deserves the praise she gets.The rest of the cast is uniformly good, but I have to highlight Jena Malone, who plays the explosive Johanna: her presence makes the screen on fire whenever she's in, mixing the perfect amount of attitude and humor. A particular scene involving an elevator and a fancy dress is at the same time hilarious and shocking, just like her character. Donald Sutherland also shines as the menacing president Snow, in a restrained performance that doesn't need too many words spoken to make you think twice on how dangerous he is.The set pieces are also vastly improved upon: bigger, more ambitious and work perfectly in sync with the action to make for some really unforgettable moments. The arena looks beautiful and foreboding, hiding it's dangers behind the shining green water. So does the bizarre Capitol and the Districts, full of sadness and fear, two dichotomies in every aspect.But what I really liked about the movie was that they didn't shy away from the political aspects from the novel and conveyed the despair and oppression imposed by the Capitol over the rest of Panem. It makes you think that all of this is happening around the world, in one way or another, maybe masquerade, but it is. It's sad that many teenagers are only in this ride for the hot action and beautiful people (some screaming girls in the movie theater I went only confirm this. They were not the majority, it was packed and most people were also extremely annoyed by it too - every time Finnick appeared it was a screaming hell). It has so much more to offer.The Hunger Games: Catching Fire not only improves vastly upon it's predecessor: it's a great cinematic experience by itself, touching on important topics about the modern day society without losing it's thrilling core. It's not perfect, but what it does right it goes right into the bullseye. Don't let the hype or the teen fury on this fool you: it is entertainment at it's best.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
A Surprisingly Good Movie That Surpasses It's Predecessor In Every Way,"I wouldn't exactly call myself a fan of the books, but I did enjoy Hunger Games, despite it's tweenie appeal. I'm a sucker for these kinds of things. Maybe it's the Battle Royale and Lord of the Flies fan in me. I did enjoy the first movie. It was a very well done adaptation. However, having read the entire trilogy, I feared that adapting the rest of the material would result in something similar to the books: terrible follow ups. As someone who takes the content of these books and the things that themes and stories they are trying to tell just a bit more seriously than the target age group might, I groaned and moaned throughout the novels, especially the last one. However, the film has done something I didn't think it could do: not suck.That's right, the movie does not suck. In fact, it's actually quite good. So good that it out does The Hunger Games in nearly every way, something that is quite the opposite of the novel. Where the original movie, while good, also came off feeling like it was feeding that tweenie audience it was aimed at, something about Catching Fire feels far more serious and far more mature. The film picks up right where we left off. Katniss and Peeta are on their victory tour, while the rest of the districts are showing signs of civil unrest due to Katniss defiance of The Capitol, that oppressive government regime that forces districts to send their children to die. To send a message to the districts that the capitol is still evil, they devise a new Hunger Games, this time forcing past victors back into the arena. Because what is a Hunger Games movie without the Hunger Games.The first film, at times, felt like it was doing too much to introduce us into this world. Everything felt like some kind of obvious plot detail. While I enjoyed the film, I often felt disconnected to it and the issues it tried to present. There was so much focus on details of the world and the games, that the presentation of the world seemed to take a back seat. Lawrence was the major saving grace, though even she wasn't perfect. All of this has changed. With the games essentially taking a secondary part in the film, there is a stronger emotional connection. It helps that all the actors involved are not only a bigger part of the film but seem to be more comfortable and are much more convincing in their roles. Where the characters of Effie and Haymitch and even Gale seemed purpose driven, with little more than a role to fill, here they feel more fleshed out. They have a greater impact and there is more of an emotional connection, from Haymitch's clear frustration between his contempt for the Capitol and his attempts to keep Katniss and Peeta alive, to Effie's attempt to keep everyone as a team and sure signs that she is struggling with the facts of Katniss and Peeta once again thrown into turmoil.The performances are the primary strength here. They do deliver on the emotion that is necessary to drive this story and don't feel like they are catering just to tweens, with the poorly written love triangle of the novel and the more trivial elements that are apart of the kind of writing that comes with novels aimed at tweens. Catching Fire feels like a serious movie with a serious story to tell. At it's heart is Jennifer Lawrence, who seems like a completely different person here. Since the original movie, as an actor, Lawrence has had several projects and has even won an Oscar. And so, it is no surprise that she feels like she is at an entirely different level. She seems more natural as Katniss and her acting is far more convincing. She comes off as someone who is not only conflicted, but scared. Even so, she remains strong and determined. Much like the first movie, as Katniss, she proves to be among the best of role models for young folk.But beyond the performances, everything just feels elevated. The story has a better focus on the growing revolution that is clearly starting. The themes are more apparent and focused on. Everything feels less obvious and more natural. Gone are introductions to this world and it's elements, replaced by a futuristic vision carried purely by it's story and characters. Even the games are better, with more exciting action, better effects, and better character interaction, helped by a cast of new characters as fellow tributes.I do seem to be gushing about the film, and it's not one I had expected to like nearly as much as I did, but I have to admit it: this was a very pleasant surprise. My fear now is that the next films won't live up to this sequel. But, I will give them more of the benefit of the doubt, considering how much this film blew me away as far as surpassing expectations. As I said in my review for the first film, fans will love this, and non-fans may also find themselves won over.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Visually Stunning.  Beautifully Tragic.  A Masterpiece. (A book fan review),"I first want to say that if you are a fan of the books, you will NOT be disappointed. Compared to the first movie adaption, this one soars, leaving the other movie to die out in the hot desert sun.I had re-read the book a day before I saw it and so I could see what the critical changes were. I would know every fine detail they let out. I first have to let you know that every book-to-movie adaption can't have 100% of the book in their. Plus, the new director, Francis Lawrence, had to clean up the mistakes the first director left out. Another thing, all the very important and even some parts you might think Hollywood would oversee is stitched together.This has to be the BEST book-to-movie adaption I have ever seen. The visuals, for one, is spectacular. $140 million budget was not wasted, that's for sure! The director packed every little intricate piece possible to make it THE BEST experience us fans could have.The acting was phenomenal. Katniss is a lot more lively now, because Jennifer Lawrence finally understood her character. The whole cast, including Sam and Josh, were amazing. Even the actress who played Johanna Mason, was FUNNY!The music, however, copied the first, because I bought the first soundtrack, so I know every little musical detail. They must have used the same music and added a few more. That was sad. But, it did fit with the scene.The action and suspense will never leave you, as the ending is a cliff hanger, holding on for dear life! (Hunger Games book fans: you won't be disappointed with the ending)Without a shadow of a doubt, this movie, Catching Fire, really does catch fire and immerses the audience in the Hunger Games.

Well I am pleased to say that the answer to all these questions are yes. This movie is by far one of the best franchise movies to date...Go suck it Twilight. Hunger Games Rule!! The acting was amazing, Jennifer Lawrence...I am in love, I don't know where she came from but she's from out of this world. They could not have casted a better Katniss, this girl it on fire! Josh Hutcherson might have grown up a bit and his portrayal of Peeta Mellark was outstanding. The rest was awesome, the victory tour, the parties, the tributes parade, the tributes, the arena, the obstacles in the arena, the CGI was memorable, and the emotion that these actors brought to the set was unforgettable.It's way better than the first one.

The perfect adaptation,"The hunger games: Catching fire was, for me, the best out of the three books. Therefore, as you can imagine, I was really looking forward to watching this film, especially since it has an 8.2 in IMDb. I must say I was not disappointed. Sure, they left out a few awesome moments from the book; but had it been in the film, it would have been almost three hours long. I felt satisfied in that sense, unlike with the first one (7/10). I felt the first film was missing too many things and there were certain scenes that disappointed me.Jennifer Lawrence is good in EVERYTHING!! So it goes without saying that she nails the Katniss role for the second time in a row. The other actors are very good as well, especially the one who plays Finnick. He is fantastic!

A Total Surprise Of A Film,"So, for a long time, I avoided The Hunger Games. I had seen and loved Battle Royale, and I felt like The Hunger Games would be a more PG version of that. But I decided to watch the first film, and I was pleasantly surprised. I enjoyed it. But this one is even better. I walked out of this film really pleased. It does have similarities to the first film, but I think this one does everything better. It has a lot of really interesting twist and turns to the story to keep me wanting to know what happens. The film ends in a way that really leaves you wanting to see the next film so you can find out how the rest of it plays out. I would say this film can appeal to both men and women, with it's mix of action, drama, and romance, and that works to it's advantage. If you enjoyed the first movie, you will love this one. This is how blockbuster movies should be made. Entertaining, but done in a way that feels like effort has been made.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Great Sequel! 7/10,"Review: What an epic movie. It carries on from the first one and it ends up in the same place. From the success if the original Hunger Games, the director had a bigger budget for this movie which you can clearly see with the CGI and elaborate scenery. The storyline was put together well and the introduction of the new characters didn't spoil the franchise. It's just a shame that Phillip Seymour Hoffman won't be in the next one. I did find the ending a bit weird, but I think that was a deliberate choice for the director who has another 2 in the pipeline. There loads of intense action and drama throughout the movie which will keep everyone entertained and there are a few twists that keep the movie interesting. I can't wait to see the next one. Enjoyable!Round-Up: The director was lucky to get most of the original cast because it wouldn't have been the same otherwise. Woody Harrelson stuck out from the rest and his unique wit brought a funny side to the movie, even though it is pretty intense. There are a lot of unanswered question a that should be answered in the next movie so I hope that it doesn't take years for it to come out. Anyway, this movie does take some time to warm up, but once it starts going it doesn't disappoint. At nearly 2 and a half hours long, the film doesn't drag or become boring throughout the movie which is a plus on the script writers and directors side. I just caught wait to see were they take this franchise,Budget: $130million Worldwide Gross: $865millionI recommend this movie to people enjoyed the first Hunger Games. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

"If you loved the first one, you'll love this one...","When I went to see ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"", the audience's reaction was very strange. They were angry--angry that the film ended because they really, really wanted more!The film picks up soon after Katniss and Peeta successfully survive the games. Now, they are to be wined and dined and trotted out from one publicity appearance to another. However, the President (Donald Sutherland) is angry and exactly why, Katniss doesn't understand. All she knows is that he insists that she act happier, act like she is in love with Peeta and do NOTHING to make waves...or people she loves will die! What she doesn't know at first is that throughout the world, discontent has broken out since her victory in the games--and folks see her as a person to rally about, as she is a symbol of hope. So what do you do when you have a symbol of hope? You destroy it--and the President orders a NEW game to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the games...and this game will return Katniss and Peeta to the arena to compete against 22 other Hunger Games winners! It sure seems like certain death!By the time I saw this film, a zillion other people already did. So I won't discuss the plot any further nor will I offer than in-depth a review. Suffice to say it's a very high quality film just like the first. So, even with a different director, it carries on perfectly from the last. Excellent acting, action and a wonderful plot make this one worth seeing.By the way, if you are older, you might notice that there is a huge similarity between this film and the original ""Rollerball"". Both present a world where the leaders want to destroy hope--and in both cases, a hero arises who somehow manages to overcome this nihilistic and fatalistic fate. See them both and you'll see what I mean.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
A lot better than the 1!,"I understand the praise definitely not among a favorite movie like someone else but quite excellent! I always appreciate Donald Sutherland his performances are superb one of the best of his was in JFK. The directing in Catching Fire is far better than part 1, Francis Lawrence is great his craft! Generally I'm not intrigued by the Hunger Games films they aren't really my cup of tea but I really like this one especially how shiny at the same it's dark too. One thing to appreciate is how these movies blossomed Jennifer Lawerence's career although Silver Lining's Playbook won her first major award.

"In the End, the Beginning of the Revolution","The Machiavellian President Snow (Donald Sutherland) fears an uprising and he threatens Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) to force her to create a distraction to the Districts with Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson); otherwise he would kill her family and friends. However he plots with Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) to summon the winners of The Hunger Games to participate in the Third Quarter Quell that happens every twenty-five years. Each of the twelve Districts would deliver two winners to the game and in the end only one will survive..Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) advises Katniss and Peeta to form alliances to survive and they team-up with Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin) and Mags (Lynn Cohen) in the beginning of the deadly game and the revolution.""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" is a great sequel of ""The Hunger Games"" (2012). The dangerous saga of Katniss and Peeta has a surprising plot point in the conclusion with the scheme for the uprising disclosed by their mentor Haymitch and by another unexpected character. Unfortunately the first part of the sequel will be only in November 2014.

"Jennifer Lawrence caught fire a few years ago, and her acting only gets hotter.","Surprised me this movie did. I had been hearing all this negative stuff about this just being the same movie as the last one, and it is really anything but. This movie really steps things up. The first movie felt fake, and very much like a unreal world that was just too oppressed. Well this one does exactly the same thing, but goes deeper, and does the things that were missing in the last movie. Sure you have most of the same characters, and most of them say lines that are pretty dead on with the first movie, but it is the first movie that makes this one so good. No matter how bad the first one was, and at times it was horrible, the actions of Katniss were all that mattered, and the only good part of the first film. This film grabs you in the heart because Jennifer Lawrence﻿ is so good at bringing Katmiss to us, and as always, acting the heck out of the room. You can not help but feel her pain at the losses she feels from the last battle, and her strong love for both men. I could not imagine this movie working with any lesser actress playing this roll. So yes I Enjoyed this one, and would recommend it to all, or any. There is a lot of violence, and some stuff that young kids will get really freaked out at, but beyond that this can be an anyone film in my book.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Karl Marx For Teens In The Third Millennium, part II","Better than the first one.I saw this film back-to-back with the first installment at a preview screening. That probably saved Catching Fire from getting another 6/10 from me because in direct comparison to the first Hunger Games, this is a step up.Again the delivery of the story is flawless. The visuals are even better than the first. The actors have grown into their characters and give rock solid performances. The stale old gender roles we're used to from the 1900's are still nowhere to be found. The perils are more horrible and tangible. The thrills get louder screams from the audience (trust me... my ears rang). And the whole thing is grittier, dirtier and without the sickeningly sweet saccharine from the first film.Story-wise the gloves come off. The People In Absolute Power recognize the Kick-ass Underdog Hero for the trouble catalyst she is and want to rein her in to restore the status quo. The Filthy Rich need their bread and circuses from The Dirt Poor, The People In Absolute Power are hell-bent on giving it to them, and no little waif from some no-name coal mining town is going to stop that... got it, waif?Yeah... she gets it. She promises to play along and makes a valiant effort to do so. Needless to say it falls apart just as quick as you can say ""paper thin facade"".The class struggle is on for real now. After seventy five years(!) the worker class begins revolting against the upper class. The next chapter of Karl Marx's theories of the uprising of the proletariat gets under way. The Hunger Games series continues faithfully as a 2010's version of Das Kapital & The Communist Manifesto For Teens.The upper class fights to hold on. To kill off the troublemakers cleanly the protagonists are once more put into gladiator fights to duke it out to the bitter end. This time around the arena of death has been ramped up to eleven. Instead of just a couple of point-and-click perils, they now come on the hour, every hour. And again The People In Absolute Power screw around with the rules just to keep the poor sods in the games from gaining the upper hand.What saves this film and makes it more enjoyable - even for a non-target-demographic old geezer like me - is that it doesn't spend over an hour establishing the premise. It's already there, which lets you forget about it and just get sucked into the nail-biting action. It works wonders and by the time of this act's finale, I'm on board in a way the first film didn't succeed with.And the thing that makes this film step up truly from its predecessor is that people finally start reacting like human beings. The participants of the games recognize them for the perversity they are and openly show it. The people in The Capitol start hinting they want the games stopped. Even the shameless bimbo - that has been looking past the cruelty of it all in order to drown out the cries of the oppressed with food and wine - starts to show cracks in her make-up. In Hunger Games I was annoyed about the premise that everyone somehow managed to box up their emotions for three quarters of a century and just take it like door mats. In Catching Fire, they are doing just that: catching fire. That is good and makes this film more watchable.Who should see this film? If you saw the first one and enjoyed it, or at least tolerated it, then this one is a given for you. And the cliffhanger glare of determination will probably have you coming back for Mockingjay - Part 1 and 2.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Better then the first one!,"""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"", is a more then solid sequel to 2012's ""The Hunger Games"". ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" begins as Katniss Everdeen has returned home safe after winning the 74th Annual Hunger Games along with fellow tribute Peeta Mellark. Winning means that they must turn around and leave their family and close friends, embarking on a ""Victor's Tour"" of the districts. Along the way Katniss senses that a rebellion is simmering, but the Capitol is still very much in control as President Snow prepares the 75th Annual Hunger Games, The Quarter Quell, a competition that could change Panem forever. The Quarter Quell for the seventy fifth games are that the tributes will be reaped from the existing victors. Katniss must make choices that will put herself and her family in danger of being killed. She and her fellow tribute Peeta must train once again for another games, but this time they must make allies as everyone who they are fighting against know one another, Katniss and Peeta are the outsiders. The Directing in this film is very well done and very smooth. ""Francis Lawrence"" boosted the game from the previous film in the franchise, which was directed by ""Gary Ross"". The difference between the two directors is that ""Francis Lawrence"" is a visionary which clearly stands out in the film. ""Jennifer Lawrence"" once again did a fantastic job as Katniss Everdeen but unfortunately ""Josh Hutcherson"" didn't quiet reach the heights of the last film as Peeta Mellark and its hard to say but ""Josh Hutcherson"" kind of sucks in this film. ""Sam Claflin"" did a fantastic job playing Finnick Odair as well as ""Jena Malon"" Playing another secondary character Johanna Mason. Although ""Jena Malons"" Johanna Mason was easily a scene stealer. Which bring me to the characters, the secondary characters in ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" are sensational and they have some enormous character development throughout the movie, as well as Katniss and Peeta. The Cinematography in this film couldn't get better, which is another improvement over the first movie as there is no shaky cam. ""James Newton Howards"" composition of the Score was amazing with the standouts being, ""The Tour"", ""A Quarter Quell"", ""Lets Start"" and ""Arena Crumbles."" There are 29 songs in the score. Lastly The Special Effects in this film are very good in some parts but noticeable in other parts. Overall ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" improved enormously over its predecessor with better acting by ""Jennifer Lawrence"", smooth directing by ""Francis Lawrence"", great characters and good special effects. I give 2013's ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
do not trust that super positive reviews,"I actually was not going to write a review but after reading all those ""best movie ever"" comments, I felt the responsibility to write something. I watched the movie at an IMax (where even the worst movie looks OK) but there was nothing visually spectacular. Character development phase is not that bad but there was no character that I could like (including Katniss. Actually especially Katniss). There was nothing special about the performance of Jennifer Lawrence to say the least. She really needs to work on acting and expressions. She was really boring. The other characters don't even have an impact. When it comes to the story, it is somewhat not so believable. I am a huge fan of sci-fi and fantastic movies but the story of Hunger Games has never been appealing to me. Anyway, do not trust that super positive reviews.

Surprisingly better and more interesting than the first,"First of all, I haven't read the books, and didn't know what to expect either from the first or the second of the Hunger Games outings. So I base this purely on the cinema experience.I watched this in a full cinema on the world premiere day, and found that the 2,5 hour long film wasn't too long at all. I tend to hate long movies, but this story is told in such an attractive way, that it keeps you seated. A couple of scenes are very effective and scary, others are really deep felt and moving. A film not only for youngsters, but a film which can entertain anyone, with twist and turns. Giving afterthoughts, and maybe also a greater understanding of importance of a free society without Big Brother watching you everywhere.I'm impressed with both the acting and the plot. It's somehow a genius idea this, to arrange some kind of reality show in a future dystopia version of George Orwell's 1984. The actors are living the film, so credits to to director. No surprise. He's done it before. I like how this film nods to a lot of classic movies and stories. Not only 1984, but there's lots, like the Old Testament of the Bible, The Birds, Lord of the Flies a.s.o. As a film buff, I enjoy this.Impressive enough, I found this better than the first, and despite the odd ending before the third, it'll be interesting to see the next in a years time. This unlike The Hobbit, which have thrown me off completely after the boring first dinner movie. Though this being a transport lap before the next, an 8/10 here is impressive. Good film making, and more interesting than most garbage served the younger generations in cinemas. Believe the hype!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Alderaan Dies,"I get asked for examples all the time, even after all these years. Okay, here's one.Noir, by my definition is the placing of a world such that the viewers collectively control it. The effect is that ordinary people in the story find themselves jerked around by fate and strange, amazing coincidences. The cause, the reason is that we as viewers want this, and bend the world's physics to make it happen. Noir is the simple state of making us gods over the world we see. At least initially, that role was marked by camera angles that an observer in the world wouldn't have, but modern noir isn't linked to cinematic style.Folding is a collection of techniques that makes the film self-aware. A simple fold is a movie that alternates between observing a world and having someone in that world acknowledge that they are in a film. A common expression of this is a film within the film with the two reinforcing each other. The effect is that the audience is placed in the film explicitly.Catching Fire is a fourfold noir. The outer world is the world of the viewer, us. We have simple needs: action and clearly drawn teen romance. Inside this is the world of Snow and Heavensbee, who watch the populace. Together with Snow and Heavensbee that populace (and us) watch the games, as the explicit audience of the traditional ""film within."" And within that is a charade our two heroes support. Each layer tries to control the next, with the last (our valued love story) affecting the others.Noir is popular in modern film because it acknowledges us in the movie. We like that, we recognize it and we notice when it isn't there. It is its own fold and is used because it works, being our most common fold. The story within the story fold is simpler, not uniquely American, and more amenable to romance because you can conflate difficulties of love which are not cinematic with political unrest which is.All this is just formula, which is what we expect. By these folding conventions, the story can use devices that otherwise would jar. For instance, as with many ""intricate plan"" movies, we count on the focus character to do things on the spur of the moment that turn out to have been essential to the plan. The planners seem to have known the future in detail; this is what characterizes noir. But holy cow, sometimes it is too much. Catch here how random it is that the wire is laying as it is, she sees it, she has an unlikely idea, she impossibly succeeds with precision timing, a hole is opened precisely over her where a vehicle is ready waiting.But Philip Seymour Hoffman? You forgive everything.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"First Was Already Very Good, This One Was Even Better!","The first movie in the Hunger Games series was very well made. It was generally faithful to the Suzanne Collins book on which it was based. The actors chosen for the cast were all very good in portraying the characters, vividly bringing the book to life. I was really looking forward to this sequel which tackles the second book in the series.This movie had a change in directors. From Gary Ross who did very well in the first film, this sequel is now directed by Francis Lawrence, whom I do not know. But there was certainly nothing to worry about after all. This second installment managed to up the ante, coming up with a film that excellently captured the escalating political turmoil among the Districts in Panem and how Katniss becomes its fiery symbol.The story picks up from the first film, where Katniss and Peeta return to their homes in decrepit District 12. Katniss's unprecedented act of near-suicide during the last Hunger Games had been seen by several citizens as an act of defiance against the government. Alarmed by this development, the threatened President Snow hatches a plan to kill Katniss before she causes more unrest all over his domain.In celebration of the 75th year of the Hunger Games, previous Victors (one male and one female) from each District to fight in another games to the death called the Quarter Quell. Being the only female Victor of District 12, Katniss was an automatic contestant, and the odds were stacked against her favor. To her surprise, she has new allies and they seem to be supporting her. How will the results of this special edition of the Hunger Games affect the revolution already catching fire outside the Capitol walls?Jennifer Lawrence is perfectly cast as Katniss Everdeen. She is really one awesome actress, burning the big screen with her emotion, making it impossible to resist empathizing with her. Even in that simple scene during the Victors Tour in District 11, home of the fallen Rue, her short heartfelt speech can make you teary-eyed. Her character can be maddening with her seeming indecision between her two consorts, but Jennifer rises above that cheap love triangle cliché. Her graceful action prowess was on full display in that archery exhibition in the training room.The other members of the cast from the last film steps up their performances for this film. Josh Hutcherson improves on his rather cheesy performance in the first film with a stronger performance here as Peeta Mellark, Katniss' games partner. Liam Hemsworth has more screen time as Gale Hawthorne, Katniss' close friend who loves her.Woody Harrelson was perfect as their mentor and former Victor Haymitch Abernathy. Elizabeth Banks succeeded to shine through her outlandish costumes and makeup as tributes escort Effie Trinket. Stanley Tucci was over-the-top in a good way, as over-the-top emcee Caesar. Lenny Kravitz has a brief but powerful role as Katniss' stylist Cinna.The new members of the cast also inhabited their roles like well-fit shoes. Donald Sutherland was formidable as President Snow needed to be. Phillip Seymour Hoffman had the requisite sneakiness and sinisterness as new Head Gamemaker Plutarch Heavensbee.Sam Claflin is not exactly the charismatic District 4 victor Finnick Odair I had in mind when I was reading the books, but he did alright. Jena Malone was better as sassy and rebellious District 7 victor Johanna Mason.The special effects of this film were amazingly conceived and executed. The Victors Chariot Parade was grandiose in its scale. The Games Venue itself and its various booby traps was so harsh with the poison fog, the vicious baboons, the confounding jabberjays, among others.The costumes of Katniss also make amazing statements in the book. I was really looking forward to how these special gowns were to be shown on screen, and I must say, they were worth the expectations. The other technical aspects such as cinematography, editing, production design and sound were all top-notch as well.This film tackles a serious political topics very well, simplified for its young target audience, but not in a way that insults more mature viewers. The Hunger Games is in a class of its own when in comes to excellence among all these young adult series that came or are coming out now -- a clear notch above all the rest.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

They chose an actor for Finnick who looked just like his description in the book. And yes, people in the Capitol like to dress crazy in this as well.

Love triangle is just pitiful, poor Peeta I don't believe that you in love with the girl and I will never do so.

A good damn sequel of The Hunger Games franchise!,"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013) is a pretty good damn sequel and that a good one, I love it very much. The first hour was boring, the second hour when they were in arena and it was shown in an IMAX version was really pretty surprisingly, amazingly awesome and so very intense that you could not shut your eyes and not see what will happen next. Katniss killed one person and a few apes that was really pretty awesome for the second Hunger Games movie like was the whole movie Rocky II. IMAX version was at least 49 min shown. Katniss finally showed real feelings for Peeta and not just an act like she did in the first movie and trough whole 2.hrs in the second movie. That's what I thought the movie was so interested, that there was a real romance in it and not just an act. The second movie was pretty damn good but did not beat the first one. Francis Lawrence did a great directing job with camera shooting every each corner including an IMAX version making a perfectly shoot of every edge of corners.This film is actually brilliant and perfect. Jennifer is beautiful and Josh is amazing and I can't say anything for Liam he is just outstanding. My favorite film by far. I really enjoyed this movie I love the story. I did laugh when the old man whistle while Katniss was giving speech and got shot by the guards. I love it when they where in the jungle. I totally love this film, this was truly brilliant a masterpiece in my opinion. The thing that bothered me in this movie was the first hour was dragging too long and was boring, in the first movie The Hunger Games we are getting faster, but by this one takes too long and it ends with a cliffhanger for to see Mockingjay Part 1 & 2. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire begins as Katniss Everdeen has returned home safe after winning the 74th Annual Hunger Games along with fellow tribute Peeta Mellark. Winning means that they must turn around and leave their family and close friends, embarking on a ""Victor's Tour"" of the districts. Along the way Katniss senses that a rebellion is simmering, but the Capitol is still very much in control as President Snow prepares the 75th Annual Hunger Games (The Quarter Quell) - a competition that could change Panem forever.This film is great, it is as great as the first movie, but I still think the original film is better than this one, because the first movie has an happy ending, this one ends with a cliffhanger. What I love in this movie is sacrifice in the 75 Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark are back thrown in to 75th Hunger Games and I love the team on the island and all dangerous in this island. I love this movie I love both of the movies, I own them on Blu-ray discs and I love them both so much. So they are both fun to watch and they do have joy in it. The key to the success of ""Catching Fire"" is its steadfast adherence to the novel's central theme: Surviving the Games and leaving the arena are not mutually exclusive. The film takes us back to the dreary District 12, where Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) have literally and figuratively been set apart from the rest of the community. Their newfound wealth and luxurious homes in the ""Victor's Village"" leave them physically isolated from those who continue to suffer and die under the Capitol's brutal regime; more importantly, their experiences in the Games have left them both with acute post-traumatic stress disorder.""Catching Fire""'s tone evolves smoothly from barely contained anxiety to foreboding to betrayal and even grim acceptance without the use of exposition -- a difficult feat for a film that is driven by action rather than dialogue. There is really no dead weight among the cast this time. Jennifer Lawrence (no relation to the aforementioned director) keeps shining bright as the reluctant Katniss, while Hutcherson imparts a level of depth to his character that was sorely missing in the first movie. Sassy Johanna Mason (Jena Malone), who uses her TV spot to curse at the Capitol audience, is a welcome foil for serious Katniss, and fan favorite Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin is awesome charismatic) wields a trident like nobody's business. Francis Lawrence made a wise decision in emphasizing the camaraderie that takes place in the largely tropical arena: It would have been a more difficult feat to distinguish this film from a watery version of the last had Katniss played the game alone. I am giving this movie a solid 10.The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a 2013 American dystopian science fiction adventure film based on Suzanne Collins' dystopian novel, Catching Fire (2009), the second installment in The Hunger Games trilogy.

The hunger for stronger material lives on,"I'll be the first soul to admit the wait between the first Hunger Games films and its sequel wasn't a particularly grueling one, and I likely could've went another year without even giving much thought to the characters or the setup. The first cinematic installment was plagued by questionably unsteady direction, clearly diluted political and social commentaries, violence with little impact, sterilized emotion, and a female hero who appeared more as an archetype or a character on a pro-women propaganda poster rather than a character with practical motivations and a believable persona to her.I reassured myself that this kind of material could resonate with me heavily after watching Kinji Fukasaku's tremendous Battle Royale, a film that still stirs up controversy and one that finds its way in conversations about its similar contemporary The Hunger Games. But I'm beginning to learn that with film, and life, no expectations equate to no disappointments. Catching Fire is a modest affair, with occasional highpoints exploring the politics of a land's government and its inherently corrupt system, but is too often burdened by hokey instances of humor, eye-rolling dialog and emotional sequences, and dreary survivalist sequences that have the feel of a video game.We are reacquainted with Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), last year's winners of the legendary ""Hunger Games"" along with her close-friend and sometimes-boyfriend Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson). At the beginning, Katniss is scolded by President Snow (Donald Sutherland) for her actions in the games because now, numerous districts are rebelling and civil unrest is prominent within much of the Panem community. Katniss and Peeta now embark on a district-wide tour, giving a speech about their victory and such, while trying to prepare for the next ""Hunger Games"" when everything seems to be in disarray. Katniss seems to be roadblocked by a love triangle with Peeta and Gabe (Liam Hemsworth), a strict government, and the thought that the world of Panem is on the verge of an implosion.The first half of Catching Fire is surprisingly strong with its examination of a narrow-minded government and further exploration into their devious actions. I was kind of shocked as to how much I was intrigued by the setups, as the first one scarcely captivated me. Writers Simon Beaufoy and Michael Arndt make the exploration more rooted in politics and social commentary, showing the consequences of Katniss and Peeta winning the last ""Hunger Games"" and the luxuries that come along with it. It would also be cruel to say that the series' new director Francis Lawrence doesn't come in at a critical time for the series as well. The second film is usually where the stakes become higher, the conflicts become deeper, and the characters become more fleshed-out and this challenge is one he handles very well. He also knows how to direct very spacious, complex landscapes such as the open wilderness and a massive Colosseum; something the original film's director Gary Ross struggled with, as much of his camera-work was shaky and unnecessarily unsteady.However, after about an hour of solid insight into the government of Panem, the film follows the relatively bland and tiring method of its predecessor by making its ""Hunger Games"" focus of the film nothing more than a survivalist video game of sorts. When it is discovered how exactly the chaos ensues and when certain forces will be summoned to attack, it reminded me keenly of how my friends and I use to play outside when we were children using our imagination that we were being chased by creatures of all kinds.I bring this up because the method Catching Fire uses to include these asinine features feels like the improvisational tactics my friends and I used as children. Now, it's a tactic I simply don't care for. It feels like run-of-the-mill fantasy filmmaking where things just happen and questioning them means you have far too much time on your hands.I suppose, however, I could deal with the film's frantic inclusion of various forces of nature compared to the onslaught of instances in this film that either don't belong or fall flat in their goal. Consider the scene when former ""Hunger Games"" victor Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), Katniss, and Peeta are all in an elevator and a woman comes in to request her dress be unzipped just so she can stand naked in front of the three to be the apple of Haymitch and Peeta's eye. Or how about the scene when an accident is almost fatal and Peeta and Katniss need to relish their existence once more by holding each other and crying in the wilderness. The scene falls completely flat because, believe it or not, Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson don't seem to have the emotional aspect of their acting down. Many of their movements are shockingly cold or just have the inability to provoke sympathy. And let's not forget all of this is captured within the boundaries of a young adult novel.It's a no-brainer that those who love the Suzanne Collins' trilogy and the original film will be among the first in line to see Catching Fire and propel the film to hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. This is a fact that cannot be challenged. After two of these films, both of which pretty similar except for the second time around things got off on a better foot for at least a brief time, I truly don't relish the thought of venturing out to see the series' conclusion twice in theaters. There's one more thing I can say positively about the film and that it's infinitely superior to the recently-released parody film of the series The Starving Games and, the more I think about it, the more I'd gladly venture out twice more to watch the series conclude than have to sit through five minutes of that film again.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
A movie bursting full of talent in all areas.,"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire has it all. What does this mean? Well, the perfect combination of action, emotion and excellent acting makes this one of the greatest popcorn movies of all time. Believe me when I say there isn't a minute when you're not on the edge of your seat but the special thing is that it's not always for those reasons. The Hunger Games goes further than providing flat out spectacle, it gives us characters we care about and actors who embody their roles and do them justice. As well as this, we get a story that isn't totally predictable and for non book-readers, the ending will likely come as a big surprise.Stand outs of the movie include the direction which was much more self- assured than the previous movie and captures the incredible action of the jungle arena as well as the acting. I didn't agree with Jennifer Lawrence's Oscar win for ""Silver Linings Playbook"" but her performances in her recent movies and her absolutely outstanding performance in this prove that she is THE actress of this movie age.The Hunger Games has gone well beyond the lame Battle Royale comparisons and really stands as an excellent movie franchise in its own right utilising the best talent Hollywood has to offer. Make sure you see it in theaters.Believe me when I say that there isn't a second during this movie when you won't be on the edge of your seat with your heart in your throat.This movie outdoes other movies of similar budgets with the perfect combination of emotion, action and tension. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire truly has it all",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
More evocative than the first; if only there was a 9.5 option....,"Catching Fire was simply better than the original from 2012. There was so much more emotion provided from the actors; they seemed to really be familiar with every aspect of their characters. Hats off especially to Jennifer Lawrence who always enthralls me with her acting. I also found that I felt a deeper connection with the movie; something that made me realize there was more passion put into this movie. And the omniscient screenplay that allowed us to get a glimpse into the actions of Plutarch (among others) that we did not get to see from Collins was a nice addition.All this being said, I go back to the point I had made about The Hunger Games. If the movie is going to be true to the book, then it should be completely true. Important characters should not be excluded; there should not be alterations to events and reasons for certain events; descriptions of major things like clothing should remain true to what the author sketched out. Obviously, these are minor things that only mean I give this movie a 9.5. But, since that choice is unavailable, I very gladly dish out a 10 over a 9.A marvelous job with the CGI and action sequences. They were never overdone and highlighted the important events. Even though a greater portion of the run time was doled out for the action than allocated in the book, it did not seem like important facets from before the Games were left out. In the book, the pre-Games chapters served to dig deeper into the world of Panem and help set up the remainder of the books. The time allotted to this in the movie was sufficient.In summary, a brilliant job by the whole crew bringing this wonderful trilogy to life. I am thoroughly anticipating both parts of the conclusion. Watched and written 03/23/2014.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Don't miss the chance to enjoy it.,"Just like the first part of The Hunger Games, this movie is equally (best to say: more) interesting. It's an adventure movie and you must judge it through that eye. The adventure of Katniss is worth watching. The thrill, the chill, love, humanity, everything is worth watching. Maybe, there are flaws in direction or the acting, maybe not. But the best part is that, the movie makes you feel better. If you can't enjoy the movie like this, then I suggest not to watch movies at all. If you want details, it's better to study the book. Don't expect the movie to go in details. The story is well adapted from the book with slight changes however. But, the movie is no way less than the book. I recommend everyone watch the movie and enjoy it.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Hunger Games grows up,"Version I saw: UK cinema screening (2D)Actors: 7/10 Plot/script: 7/10 Photography/visual style: 7/10Music/score: 6/10Overall: 7/10It's not in the least bit original, but that is not the point. Ever since I saw the first Hunger Games film a couple of years ago, the sources from which it drew inspiration were pretty obvious. Suzanne Collins claims never to have heard of Battle Royale when she wrote the books, but the premise is so similar that it is hard to credit, and there are strong echoes of Rollerball and The Running Man.The excellence of the films, though, is in the delivery. It is there in the acting, exemplified by the storied Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence). Katniss is genuinely one of the best feminist role models around today, a complex three-dimensional character often favourably compared to Twilight's Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart). Lawrence has also developed in the last couple of years into a highly respected actress from whom one can expect a strong, serious performance every time.Like Lawrence, all the characters and actors involved with the Hunger Games have developed from adolescence to full-on adulthood, with an increase in maturity and consideration. The plot is all about this tension, between the well-considered, dispassionate choice and the emotive decision dictated by the heart.Add in the well thought out production design, evoking a largely low-tech future that is easy to understand so that the more complex science-fiction concepts can pass without difficulty.Intelligent, well thought out design that develops the story between films, and solid professionalism in delivery, make The Hunger Games what it is. I only hope they are not derailed by the death of Philip Seymour Hoffman.For my full review, see my independent film blog on Blogspot, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Real Characters, Great Plot, A Sumptuous Feast For The Eyes!","DISCLAIMER- IN READING THIS, I AM ASSUMING YOU HAVE SEEN THE FIRST MOVIE. IF YOU HAVE NOT, BE WARNED - THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!The second installment in the Hunger Games series, entitled CATCHING FIRE, is a sensational film. From the chilling first moments to the unforgettable climax, this movie grabs you, hoists you into the arena with Jennifer Lawrence, and doesn't let you go, even after the movie has ended.Jennifer Lawrence reprises her role as Katniss Everdeen, The Girl On Fire, in the follow-up to the (slightly depressing) first Hunger Games movie. She plays a teenage girl, still shaking from the trauma of the televised gladiatorial child-killing spree, the annual Hunger Games. The trauma is real on her face, as is every other emotion through the movie.Josh Hutcherson returns (much to the teenage girls of America's delight) as Peeta Mellark, a bread maker, also a Victor from the previous year. His desperate attempts to calm Katniss, befriend Katniss, and woo Katniss are as real as they come.Following them is a line of former victors and supporting actors. Woody Harrelson as Haymitch, Lenny Kravitz as Cinna, Stanley Tucci as Cesar Flickerman, and Elizabeth Banks as Effie Trinket, to name a few, are particularly good.And that's not mentioning the film's visuals. From start to finish, the movie is a feast for the eyes and ears, from the sumptuous visuals of the Capitol to the danger and excitement of the arena.This movie will keep you reeling with suspense, rolling on the floor from occasional bursts of humor, and cheering with the entire cast of this, the 75th annual HUNGER GAMES!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"I may catch fire for this, but I did not love this one!","""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" did not deliver the fiery passion of the original. However, I think devoted fans of the novels probably will catch a lot more from this one than those who did not hit ""The Hunger Games"" books. Nevertheless, I feel that Director Francis Lawrence was no Sir Francis in keeping the movie-going audience vastly entertained with this edition. Maybe my appetite for ""The Hunger Games"" relinquished after seeing more of a forces of nature aspect to this sequel, while the original had more a thirst for survival appetite. Oscar-winning screenwriters Simon Beaufoy and Michael Arndt did not scribe up a magnetic screenplay, even though maybe what Simon says was not too Ardntly; OK, I am catching fire with these cheesy puns. Jennifer Lawrence does shine here again as Katniss Everdeen; The J-Law is still in effect and is here to stay. Woody Harrelson also delivered charismatically once again as Haymitch; so cheers to that. Donald Sutherland also demonstrated that his senior years have not affected his thespian brilliance portraying here proficiently the ruthless President Snow; so yea, let it Snow, let it Snow, let it Snow for this trilogy. And there is the masterful Stanley Tucci as Hunger Games host Caesar Flickerman. The rest of the acting of the movie was just subpar which includes that ""I rather be eating Pita bread"" than watching Josh Hutcherson's humdrum performance as Hunger Gamer Peeta Mellark; or maybe I am just writing a whole bunch of Mellarky. Anyways, it's worth catching ""Catching Fire"" but you will probably be left tasting for more. *** Average",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Best Movie in the Series,"I think this movie was probably the best in the entire series of the Hunger Games. I have read all the books and while the entire series is missing a lot of important details, I am willing to let that slide because of how good this movie was. I watch it back time and time again because I get so entranced by how unreal it is. The acting is incredible, especially Josh Hutcherson as Peeta; he continues to impress over time. Don't get me wrong Jennifer Lawerence is incredible too but something about the love that Peeta has for Katniss just gets me every time. This is a perfect example of a series that gets better and better as the series goes on. If you some how have not seen this movie, I would 110% recommend. I first saw this movie in theaters when it first came out and that experience felt out of body to say the least. It builds off the last movie so definitely watch the first movie if you haven't. It adds so much more backstory to the characters that I enjoy. The action sequences are thrilling and anxiety inducing to be honest.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Average movie with too much hype,"I haven't read the novel and saw the first movie, which in my opinion is really good and felt like a complete movie. The movie itself is not bad and has a good cast. But the ending is abrupt and you will not feel like you had watched a complete movie. it is like an episode in an TV series. This is the way all the big companies earn their money and not good for the audience.there is not much action scenes and the plot drags in the expected way. The movie lost the novelty and this movie is just another run of the mill movie.Go with less expectation and you may be rewarded.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Great going,This movie is my favourite movie in Hunger games series,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Terrific and over the top good and also more of the same,"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013)Well, there is so much to be thrilled about here you can't just dis this movie as a rehash of the old stuff. It's epic and bizarre and tragic and inventive. It's funny and sad. It has some great serious and campy acting. And it carries on the plot and tradition of the first movie well. The repeat performance of Jennifer Lawrence is really good. She remains a convincing model and role model, a perfect mixture of humility, compassion, and strength when required.But way down at the bottom of it all, it does rehash old stuff. Yes, it progresses, but I keep remembering my starry surprise at the whole idea when watching the first movie. It was all so crazy and almost possible. It drew from powerful archetypal sources, from Roman gladiator battles to Nazi rallies to Native Americans surviving in the wilderness. And it was new and fresh every time.Not possible here, and I missed that a lot.Such is the problem with sequels. And yet that's part of the appeal of a sequel— a world has been created where the viewer enters already informed and invested (and in love, perhaps). You want to go back. So how do you keep the new installments alive? It was done with the Bourne movies, and Nolan's Batman movies. But it is only partly done here.Too much is familiar, and some is even a bit worn. The romances are merely continuations (the leading woman is a two-timer in a believable and touching way). The secondary characters are mostly familiar (Philip Seymour Hoffman is new but there is Sutherland and Harrelson, both terrific, and Tucci, who is a riot even the second time). The leads are of course the same, but they end up in the most familiar thing of all, the actual battle.And the battle, which is the whole last third of the movie, is the biggest weakness. We know who we want to win of course, and we don't know how they're going to pull off saving more than one hero. But it's a familiar mix of speed and luck and ingenuity. It's pure action adventure stuff, running and shooting and fighting, very well done and exciting, for sure. But it is what it is. I'm talking familiarities.What about the message here? The big theme is an autocratic militaristic government controlling so many lives, and an ordinary population where the people are wonderfully ordinary and sympathetic. The heroine feels she can do nothing to help and wants to leave with her local boyfriend into the wilderness. But she is called to action and she shows the power of not being selfish. A new Hunger Game scenario is set up and a visit to the big city with all the pizazz, and we see a sense of solidarity between Victors from previous games. The message is cooperation rules, and the games shows a little bit of the Avengers aspect, each fighter with their own power.It wasn't enough, somehow, but this is compared to round one. As a movie it was stunning in so many ways it wins anyway.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Very fulfilling!!!,"I am one of those people who didn't read the book but were anticipating the film so much that I feared it was gonna disappoint me but fortunately...it didn't!!Francis Lawrence successfully managed to create a proper movie sequel that kept me at the edge of my seat all the time!! Most people don't know that there is a lot more to Catching Fire than a teen movie with another love triangle and hot young stars. But I think the realistic political references within the story actually make it a very mature film, its what gives the film a lot of magnitude, excitement and suspense. I know why some people thought it was boring; the film didn't focus on chase and killing sequences in the games, but its not about the games anymore, its about the hunger revolution and the tensions the will lead up to it. That's what the film focused on and that's why we don't actually get into the games until half of the screen time.The story was build up smoothly, it takes time in the beginning to take us back to the characters, which are more mature, relatable and complex this time round, thanks to the writers and the acting talents of the cast who were not affected by cheesy stardom. Jennifer Lawrence is still on top of the game, she is so immersed in the role of Katniss that not once did I feel that that's the actress who won an Oscar last year. Josh Hutcherson gave his character huge likability through his subtle performance, it will be interesting to see how he will evolve as Peeta's character changes in the coming sequels. Liam Hemsworth, Donald Sutherland and Elizabeth Banks return strongly and have more emotional roles than the first film. Sam Calfin (Finnick) was a great addition to the cast and Jena Malone's Johanna was a scene stealer!! However, I didn't get enough of Woody Harrelson and Philip Seymour Hoffman, they fell a little short for me.Although the dialogue was a little weak sometimes, it was very smart and witty which infused the dystopian scene of the film with such realism. They added so much more complexity to everything this time, whether you're a fan of the love triangle or the revolution idea, you'll be satisfied either way, especially because the cinematography and visual effects are so much better now, finally!!! What's missing however is a little bit more action, the climax of the film did not exactly reach its peak for me. I think if it had, the film would have definitely smashed the box office longer than The Avengers did. Despite that, it was still very fulfilling and it really deserved all the publicity it was given throughout the year. I can't wait for the next film, hopefully it will top this one!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
An example of what a blockbuster should be.,"As the lights dimmed and I relaxed in my seat, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire began with a long shot of its heroine, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), crouching on a rock in the wintery forest. This silhouette of Katniss in the center of the screen melts your eyes with its bleak poetry and allowed me to set aside my prejudgments about this sequel based on a best- selling teen novel series. This single shot sets the tone, expectation, and the precedent of beautiful cinematography that lay ahead.The original film is more of a served as a solid teen film, I sustained a moderate anticipation for the sequel, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire. I was not prepared for the gusto the director, Francis Lawrence, was going to deliver. Lawrence thankfully replaced Gary Ross, the director of original film.District Twelve Tributes Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark have won the Hunger Games by feigning the world of their undying love. Their victory against the Capitol has resulted in the beginning stages of a rebellion amongst the citizens. The leader of Capitol, President Snow, orders Katniss and Peeta both justify their actions in ""cheating the system"" by proving their love to be legitimate. For the 75th Hunger Games, Katniss and Peeta are thrown back into the Game, facing off against previous winners as their opponents.Catching Fire digs deeper into the themes dug by the original including totalitarianism, reality TV metaphorically killing our youth, and the false implications that are intertwined with a celebrity image. They own what they are looking to explore and do not compromise insightful art for gushy romance and violent action.The love that Katniss and Peeta find in the sea of false feelings and acting may be the most honest thing the series has to say. It's not love at first sight. The irony is Katniss and Peeta are forced to display a celebrity image of love. What the audience expects from their relationship is an immediate external attraction, but they find love in seeing the other person underneath, a lesson of life and love we learn as we mature.Academy Award winner Jennifer Lawrence produces her best acting performance to date in The Hunger Games: Catching Fire. She has the strength to carry Katniss and her newfound psychological traumas while owning her role as leader. What Sigourney Weaver accomplished in Aliens is similar to what Lawrence displays in Catching Fire, she's given the opportunity to vamp up the pathological expressions of a damaged woman after establishing her character in the original film.Post-traumatic stress is a favorite concept of mine to explore with female characters in sequels. Lawrence both reveals and hides that vulnerable side of Katniss, behind the shield of her stubbornness and aggression. Lawrence succeeds where Kristen Stewart failed in leading the Twilight series. Like the original film, Katniss has a specific feminist character arc she must fulfill; Lawrence subtly tracks that arc in each scene and turning another beautiful acting job. Though I think the pop culture immensely overreacted to Lawrence in the past two years, she has the mark of a great actress, one that will be a gem her generation.I am crazy about the sinisterly beautiful cinematography and the emotional film score of Catching Fire. The sets are ravishingly decorated, the costumes are bombastic, and the make- up pays attention to smalls details. Catching Fire has the occasional missteps, though they are thin and widely dispersed.A problem from the original film that is rectified in this sequel is that the first 80 minutes have a story to tell and don't read like a directions manual to a board game. The Hunger Games as a series grew up a great deal in the small time frame between the first and second films. Catching Fire is not a teen film, it may have been written to be, but the film emerges as a permissible addition to great science fiction adventures in cinema.Will we look back and think that Catching Fire changed the world? Is it important art? No, but it's the most entertaining film of the year and the blockbuster that stands tall amongst a sea of misfires.Rating: 8Grade: A",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Good improvement from the first,"Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) are home after winning the Hunger Games. Katniss is sparking some rebellious acts. President Snow (Donald Sutherland) is desperate to reign in the opposition by co-opting the Katniss-Peeta relationship. Only they have barely spoke in the last 6 months, and she is still with Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth). Snow forces Katniss and Peeta to fake their relationship, and institute a winners-only 75th Hunger Games as a way to maintain control.I've never read the books. Looking at only the movies, this is a good improvement over the first one. Katniss and Peeta are more developed characters. Their relationship has a lot more color. It is the emotional content where most of the improvement has occurred. The most interesting new character has to be Johanna Mason (Jena Malone). She adds a bit of wild energy to the movie.The production value takes a small step forward. The apocalyptic sets are still looking too sparse. The bigger CGI settings still has an older iteration feel. I like the monkeys, and the birds scenes. It's a good improvement from the last games. Overall, this movie is a good step up. It actually makes me looking forward to the next movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: The high-octane second installment in the Hunger Games film quadrilogy,"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is the much-awaited sequel to the 2012 blockbuster, The Hunger Games, which was based on the second novel in Collins' acclaimed The Hunger Games trilogy—a young adult science fiction series set in a dystopian, post-apocalyptic districts of Panem under the ruthless control of a totalitarian state called the Capitol. With several actors reprising their roles from the previous film, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire has an ensemble star cast that includes the likes of Jennifer Lawrence, Donald Sutherland, Stanley Tucci, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Woody Harrelson.The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is set on a much grander scale in comparison to its prequel. The plot picks up from where it was left in the first movie with Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark, the tributes chosen from District 12, being declared as the joint winners of the 74th Hunger Games under dramatic circumstances. The shocking turn of events which saw the emergence of not one but two winners for the first time in the games' history seems to have infuriated President Coriolanus Snow who is adamant on teaching Katniss and her kin a painful lesson. What ensues is a whirlwind adventure of epic proportions that will shake the very foundations of the residents of Panem and the dictatorial regime that governs it.The Hunger Games: Catching Fire gives great attention to the technical detail. But, what makes it stand out is the meticulous manner in which it seems to tackle the emotional aspects which often seems to be lacking in such films. The credit for this must go to the director for eliciting worthy performances from almost all his actors and the screenwriters for adding a great level of maturity to the plot by the virtue of a multilayered narrative while keeping intact the thriller and mystery elements of the novel.Speaking of movie's technical elements, it's imperative to talk about Alan Edward Bell's taut editing and Jo Willems' breathtaking cinematography. While Sutherland, Tucci, Hoffman, Harrelson and Wright are brilliant in their respective roles, it is Jennifer Lawrence who is absolutely mesmerizing to watch. It's an absolute delight to see her go from strength to strength, completely unfazed by her recently acquired super-stardom, continuing to deliver one strong performance after another with such aplomb that one usually associates with great thespians.Overall, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire offers entertainment galore. It may not be great cinema but it's definitely much superior to the run-of- the-mill Hollywood productions that are all style and no substance. Catching Fire is a high octane extravaganza that also offers some food for thought for those who are willing to look beyond the obvious. Catching Fire serves as a powerful social commentary in that it highlights how the strong tend to oppress the weak when in absolute control of things. We have a real entertainment feast at our disposal and it's only prudent to savor it to the fullest. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
A repetitive transition between the first instalment and the closing chapter in two parts,"Here it is: ""1984"" feature ""Battle Royale"" Part II - the follow-up nobody really needed.On a more serious note, I must though admit that I enjoyed the first movie. It wasn't original but the settings were great, the camera and light work flawless, the costumes and effects stunning and the different characters during the battle competition were somewhat intriguing and had some depth as well.This time, the movie bores us with an overlong introduction. Instead of developing the main characters, we just get exposed to things we had already known or seen before in the first movie. This is basically just a waste of precious time as neither the characters nor the story gets any new elements.The reason why the radical autocracy sets off a special edition of the Hunger Games is completely ridiculous but I'm aware of the fact that this part is based on the books, so the movie makers are not to blame. Let's just say that the stories of the first and the second movie are too similar to make the second part stand out anyhow.It's simply not impressive anymore to see the colourful characters, clothes and make-up because we have been there before. The new characters that are taking part in the new Hunger Games aren't as interesting as in the first part and once some characters finally start to act in suspicious way, the whole movie is already over and any development suddenly aborted. Some characters seemed to be interesting such as the brutal young woman with the strange teeth but they almost have no screening time at all. Once again, I call this a waste of time and potential.Why does this movie still get a passable rating? The acting is of a good average quality. The decorations, effects and settings are similar to the first movie but still on a high quality. Some adrenaline driven scenes during the Hunger Games will get you on the edge of your seats. The open ending is interesting enough to make you want to see more and watch the next two instalments of the series (of course, they needed to make two more movies out of it to make more money just as the last two Harry Potter movies). So, there still are a lot of positive elements and the great images and sounds make it worth to watch it in your local cinema.On the other side, this film is not much more than ""1984"" meets ""Battle Royale"" for the ""Twilight"" generation. I must admit that I'm a big fan of dystopian movies and novels and that's why I'm also enjoying the ""Hunger Games"". If you're not just following a trend, a little bit more mature and honestly enjoying this franchise, you should definitely watch classics such as ""Fahrenheit 451"", ""A Clockwork Orange"", ""Soylent Green"", ""Rollerball"", ""Equilibrium"", ""Renaissance"" and so on and compare them to the ""Hunger Games"". If you think any of these movies is weaker than this new output, let's say you have a very curious opinion.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a well worthy follow-up to its predecessor,"Well, it's been more than a year since I saw The Hunger Games and really enjoyed it so when I watched this sequel with my movie theatre-working friend (who had seen it twice before and liked it), I was very glad I did! The stakes are higher this time as Katniss' actions in the previous one and her actions here really put Donald Sutherland's character in a bind he desperately wants to get out of. And Jennifer Lawrence is once again fine as the conflicted heroine who tries to survive against the madness she constantly has to deal with. This is modern epic storytelling at its finest with some of the best casting I've seen for a movie in recent years, that's for sure! So on that note, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is well worth the time!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Significantly stronger than the first film, but still suffers from the same plot holes and contrivances.","""Katniss!"" the crowd screams, giddy with excitement. In just a short year, Jennifer Lawrence has rocketed beyond the fame of her most iconic character so far. While she has been one of my favourite 'it-girls' in recent years for her likable personality and well-rounded career, it does concern me that the backlash is just around the corner. Will 2014 be less kind to her? Will she fade? Will the hysteria just grow stronger? Fortunately, she does deserve the praise she's getting, even if it does feel quite premature since she could potentially win a second Oscar with American Hustle. I hate to admit that I'm getting a little fatigued with her desperate cries and screeches that were overused in Catching Fire, but perhaps that's the director's fault and not Jennifer Lawrence's. She's certainly gained a star presence that shrouds her in an alluring aura that I hope she'll continue to flaunt with sincerity. There's not enough of that these days.I really disliked the first Hunger Games film. As someone who's never touched one of the books, the film exists in a world where it assumes the book is the audience's bible. Far too much goes unexplained, unjustified and taken for granted. Fortunately, Catching Fire finds its footing, if not entirely recovered from that difficult intro of the first film where all the dramatic exposition in the world won't cover it, this film is simply in much better hands. With Simon Beaufoy and Michael Arndt behind the wheel of the script, I can trust them to have the material make as much sense as possible and bring the potential out of every character of its crowded ensemble (though I still don't know who Liam Hemsworth is supposed to be). Gone is the infamous shaky-cam and in comes a more confident visual approach. What saves it most is the on-point editing that provides much more comfortable pacing, especially as we're treated to an enjoyably creative montage as Katniss and Peeta tour the districts.While the first film didn't know what to do with its moral stance on death and killing, Catching Fire explores more human depths as Katniss struggles with PTSD. The film is moody with its heavy emotion but it doesn't come from a stake-less teenage angst part of the characters but from a tension in the fragile fabric of their world. It still scratches the surface of its potential since it can only redeem its predecessor a limited amount, but it's an admirable attempt. However, it suffers from typical plot holes and contrivances that the first film struggled with too. I'm sure these ideas are covered in the book, but the film really should've pushed the justification. I'll let go 'why don't they kill each other in training' but why do they make allies if they'll have to kill each other in the end anyway? I just don't buy that trust. Suzanne Collins sure lives in a logic of her own as far as her self-preservation theme plants her. It just gives me a headache. I may not stick for Mockingjay, but Catching Fire is a relatively enjoyable and involving experience.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

Catching Fire Fails to Even Play With Fire.,"I wanted to LOVE this movie, but I just couldn't. Don't get me wrong, this movie is worth a watch and if you are choosing between Thor 2 and Catching Fire, Catching Fire is the clear winner. But this is a film with such a radical premise that is never fully explored or realized in order to gain as much revenue as humanly possible.I was shocked to find out that this movie actually had a different director than the first. Mid-way through Catching Fire I felt as though I had just re-watched the first half of the original Hunger Games. The style, the story, even the character development was all exactly the same. LITERALLY exactly the same. Examples of similarities between Hunger Games and Catching Fire: 1. Katniss is in love with Gale and wants to run away with him because things are getting tough in district 12. 2. Katniss unexpectedly ends up in the hunger games. 3. Katniss storms out on Peta, Haymitch and Effie while on the train. 4. Fire effects on the costumes. 5. Peta's unexpected plot twist at the interviews. Of course this is a short and simple list that could be expanded. Basically both the first half of The Hunger Games and Catching Fire are exactly the same (almost even the same shots).Its just repetition repetition. Other than a few twists this film is like a sour regurgitation of The Hunger Games. The director and screenwriter could have run with some of the subtexts (like violence for sport) and show some in your face shocking violence but instead chose the safe route that would guarantee a PG-13 rating... all to cater to a wider audience and generate higher earnings. Other than the costumes, there was nothing creative about this film.I should mention though, the acting performances were fantastic and spot on. No complaints there.For these reasons I give it a 6/10. Watch it if you like, but its no film of the year and will more than likely be the most quickly forgotten of the series.Zach",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Positive surprise of the year,"Back when I saw the first Hunger Games I generally liked it, but I had several concerns about it. It was a bit predictable, at times too slow paced, and (except for Rue) I wasn't 100% satisfied with the acting performance. Still the universe of The Hunger Games seemed appealing enough to check out Catching Fire...And man it was worth it so much! The Hunger Games back at the time didn't make me read the books these are based on - now the first thing I did after getting home from the cinema (from Catching Fire) was to order the trilogy.In Catching Fire everything just clicks into it's place. The universe expands, the story and characters unfold and start to gain their twists, and the slow-pacedness is gone. The movie gains your attention right at the start and it stays entertaining, exciting, thrilling and gripping all the way to the end.The director change to Mr. Lawrence was also a blessing, the scenes are beautifully shot, the pace is very good, and the view is spectacular. Although it's not in 3D and all, things, details (e.g. Katniss's dresses) are designed with an awful lot of creativity and attention. It's obvious that the scenes got a lot of love and care during shooting, and this makes it all feel more natural, real, and very high quality. Combined with the soundtrack which was already great in the first episode, the overall experience is marvelous.The last, but most important thing I also have to mention is the acting performance. Well here it is just brilliant, both by the protagonist and all the other characters, I was left breathless! Among many things regarding the story and the characters, while walking my way out of the cinema I couldn't stop wondering about just how many unspeakable talents Hollywood has, and all they need is just a chance to be able to shine. Here they got it, and they lived with it well.There is however a negative side of Catching Fire as well, which is the fact that it is cut in half the way an ordinary TV channel cuts movies to pieces with all their advertisements. They didn't even have to bother to leave you with a great cliffhanger... There is so much of the story and characters that you crave to know and see, that when you realize you have to wait another year to continue, it physically hurts.In a nutshell: Although unfinised, without doubt this one is a masterpiece in all imaginable aspects!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Continuation Errors Galore,"Another almost great film, ruined by plot holes, continuation errors and an obvious story.Although better than the first film, Catching Fire still didn't meet my expectations created by the ridiculous amount of hype about the film before it's release. Starts slow and only really picks up around the half way mark. Just when you're starting to get into the story, which as, I said, is rather predictable although full of continuation errors, it ends. The ending how ever, is barely and ending. It may as well say 'you can't enjoy this film without paying to see the next one.' The first film didn't have this problem, so I don't see why they've done it here.On another note, Katniss' love triangle made this hard to watch and made me dislike her as a character.Despite all this, the acting is, for the most part, believable, with strong performances by Woody Harrelson and Elizabeth Banks.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Even better than the first.,"This film is the second in the adaptation of a literary trilogy by Suzanne Collins. I did not read them, I have no particular intention of doing so for any particular reason, so I will ignore the books and focus on the film, which was already expected for those who saw the first one due to its open ending.In this film, we continue to follow the story of Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark, the unlikely Hunger Games winners we saw in the first film. They have to live the life of winners, but that life means becoming the target of national scrutiny, thanks to their popularity and the propaganda machine of President Snow, eager to use them to keep people entertained, without thinking about politics. But Katniss, against her will, had become a symbol for those who stand against that totalitarian regime, and Snow decides to organize new games where he can get rid of her in an exemplary way: designed to celebrate the seventy-five years of victory over the rebels, the new games will bring together just the winners from previous editions, knowing in advance that District 12 had only one female winner: Katniss will have to participate.To begin with, its necessary to say that this film was not directed by the same director as the first. But this is something that the public will only notice if they are very attentive, since it matches, in quality and impact, the initial film. Everything is quite clear, especially if the audience has previously seen the first film (a premise to understand any sequels, of course). And if in the first film we see similarities between Panem and Ancient Rome, these similarities will become more visible as the Snow's regime reveals itself openly dictatorial, totalitarian and established on a cult of personality around him.Jennifer Lawrence remained in excellent shape, as she had done in the first film. Her entire performance clearly reveals her mixed feelings and her character's intense and strong character. Josh Hutcherson is much better here than in the first film. He takes the initiative, quickly understands what needs to be done to survive the new challenges. Despite that, I can't take Hutcherson seriously and he always sounds strange to me. Okay, the defect may be mine, I admit, but that's how the actor's performance looks to me. Donald Sutherland never seemed so Machiavellian and somber as in this film, in an admirable performance that can be one of the most striking in the actor's recent career. Stanley Tucci was also amazing in the deeply satirical way in which he brought a sensationalist TV host to life. Elizabeth Banks and Woody Harrelson gain even more psychological depth. Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jeffrey Wright, Amanda Plummer, Sam Claflin, Lynn Cohen and Jena Malone also do a good job.In addition to a great cast and a good story, the film has excellent production values: careful cinematography with good contrast, even better than in the first film; excellent sets and costumes and CGI and sound effects even more spectacular than the first ones. The soundtrack also deserves special mention for its effectiveness and beauty. Composed by James Newton Howard, it is one of those that remains in the ear long after we have seen the film.Full of action and with an excellent story, this film is excellent and, for those who liked the first one, it will certainly be a must and leave the feeling that it was little. It is worth seeing and will definitely leave your appetite ready for the third film. However, and I repeat what I said in the review of the first film, I do not know how much younger children are prepared to see and, above all, to understand the story told. In addition, prevention remains: it is a film with some violent content and this has to be taken into account by parents and educators.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Excellent Sequel,"Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) become targets of the Capitol after their victory in the 74th Hunger Games sparks a rebellion in the Districts of Panem.Not to deny the first film any acclaim it deserved, but the second is much improved because we are less concerned with love and more concerned with the basic human instinct of survival. We also get more of the political aspects that really provide the story a much deeper meaning.The film is bolstered by a strong cast -- not only the wonderful Donald Sutherland, but some great newcomers like Jena Malone and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Hopefully Hoffman's role in future films will not be compromised too terribly by his passing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"People think this better than the first film, but is it?","Everyone is so eager to say the second Hunger Games movie (""Cathing Fire "") is even better than the first. Why do they say that? Anyway it's just assumed now viewers know the whole story, or at least saw Part One, so we plunge in this time, with less introduction to this ultra-popular young adults sci-fi tale by Susanne Collins. One may miss Part One's introductory material, its glimpses of the impoverished District 12, which Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), the protagonists, come from, and the gloriously absurd foppishness of the Roman Empire-inspired ruling class who prance around when the games, designed apparently both to distract and terrify the oppressed majority, are held.In Part One, instead of following the Hunger Games rule of saving only one survivor of the dog-eat-dog competition, which is like an out-in- the-electronically-generated-force-field-infested-woods version of to-the-death Roman gladiatorial contests, two Tributes (contestants), Katniss and Peeta, get saved by cleverly posing as a romantic couple. Even maniacal dictators have a heart, or it just seems good public policy to celebrate love among the peons. (This new movie has much more hugging and kissing than killing, though it has a brutal whipping only 12 Years a Slave can outmatch, and of course killing does occur; it just doesn't seem to hurt quite as much as Part One's.) The ""Victor,"" i.e., the Hunger Game annual winner -- the lowbrow mindset requires the word be explained -- normally gets to live an absolutely protected life from then on, his or her triumph saving him or her from future competitions.Let's not fail to note that ""him or her"" is primarily ""her,"" because this, like the ""Twilight"" series, is by and for primarily young adult females, and so the story has a strong girl-empowerment angle, for which everybody agrees the steely, glowing Jennifer Lawrence is the ideal central emblem.But trouble is afoot. The year's ongoing public appearances of Katniss and Peeta in various Districts, when they stir things up by jettisoning their prepared spiels, show that a spirit of rebellion is afoot. President Snow (Donald Sutherland), who seems to have nothing much to do but drink tea and watch these displays, is very displeased at these hints of trouble afoot among the lower orders. After all he's basically a fascist dictator -- though, by the way, if you just watch the Triumph of the Will you'll see that real-life Nazis did all this grandiose spectacle stuff way better than the Lionsgate folks.Snow decides to break the rules and bring back last year's double Victors to the annual life-and-death competition again. When they're dead, Snow figures the revolutionary spirit will fade, thought this is a dubious notion, since the people are leading their own revolt, not Katniss and Peeta, however much they may serve as inspiring symbols.Anyway, off we go: Part Two is Part One with a new urgency, because the whole annual Hunger Games scheme of keeping the masses too terrified to revolt now seems to be failing. We have a new director for the film itself (a method used to freshen up the Twilight series too), Francis Lawrence instead of Gary Ross, not that that's part of the story line. We've got some new name actors. A puffy, uneasy-looking Philip Seymour Hoffman, not by any means at his best, is the master of the games (was there one before?). There's a new pair of ""mature"" Tributes (to attract the adult audience? -- played by Jeffrey Wright and Amanda Plummer) supposedly chosen for brain, not brawn. Wright hence wears nerdy glasses and Plummer, who might seem an odd choice, is proclaimed a ""genius"" for a nutty chant that tips off the others to how the island they're competing on is set up. There's also an old lady called Mags, played by an 80-year-old actress (Lynn Cohen), who must be pretty athletic to hold onto Finnick (Sam Claflin) as he races through the woods with her clinging to his back.Woody Harrelson, who continues to be a welcome note, partly because his character Haymitch's over-the-top style hardly seems any stretch at all for him, hasn't done anything interesting in between Parts One and Two - - unless you think Seven Psychopaths and Now You See Me are great movies. But Jennifer Lawrence (no relation to the director, I trust) on the other hand returns with greatly increased luster, having become a regular with a David O. Russell at the top of his game, winning the Oscar for her turn in his Silver Linings Playbook and coming up in his promising but as yet unseen American Hustle. Other actors give us more of the same. Stanley Tucci (as the broadly parodic game show master of ceremonies Caesar Flickerman) deserves credit for being just as cannily manic and silly this time as last. But despite a lot of focus on Katniss' dazzling game intro wedding gown outfit -- she and Peeta were going to wed -- there doesn't seem to be as much spectacle this time, or as much dwelling on elaborate makeup and gear.There is also the weakness that this time to make Katniss more admirable she fires only in self defense, and one doesn't feel the danger or the terrifying sense of attrition as participants are eliminated. Been there, done that. Spectacular effects -- lightening, explosions, holograms, shifting earth, falling sky -- can't hide the fact that it's all familiar this time, and you can make Katniss and Peeta almost die, but we'd have to be pretty dumb to worry. It's not that ""Catching Fire"" is better than Part One: it's just that more reviewers have drunk the Kool-Aid. That didn't happen to me; quite the reverse. Let's hope somehow the story will reengage me in the followup.The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, 146 mins., opened in US theaters 22 Nov. 2013.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Hunger games a wonderful masterpiece,"A beautiful adaptation, this second is more entertaining than the first because he's just a miracle i can say, to see how the picture is and also the acting of Jennifer Lawrence and all the cast, this must be a very very good add to cinema's masterpieces, because harry potter is good but this saga hunger games is a masterpiece because they are some scenes that are incredible, i was enjoyed seen this movie, and i think the difference is that the director is different and this what makes the movie more good than the first, not simply good but wonderful and amazing. And to see it in premiere is the best thing never happened in my life, you live with the movie like if he was not just 3D but 4d , enough emotions and sensibility, i think that you need to watch it because if you don't you missed an important part of your life, go to see it in cinemas.

Killed potential and romance,"First thing that ruined all sequels was romantic line. Every single part they try to make some ""surprise"" out of main romantic line. But one twist doesn't work twice. Either they should've done slow scenario or it was better to change motivation.
BUT!
Everything stays the same including plot twists.
That's why pure characters were really spoiled by this. Who loves whom etc?
The next minus is no background story about characters. It could be really interesting to know more about mentors or other players.
Also the president and his power doesn't look strong at all.

Excellent Book to Movie!,"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is an amazing movie and deserves a higher rating than it currently has on IMDb. The Hunger Games series is one of my favorite series for several reasons. I will not spoil it for those that have yet to read the series, so my comments will be fairly vague. The series is very well written and worth the time to read. It also sends a powerful message about leaders and government, power and strength, persistence and hope, and ultimately the greater good.The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is my favorite book out of the series, so I was extremely excited to see this movie in theaters. It did not disappoint. It followed the book closely and even used most of the same lines that the characters had in the book. The special effects were definitely better in this movie than in the previous one. I am glad that they got a new director. If you have chosen not to see this one because of the last one, rest assured it is entirely different and much, much better! The set was also great, it is pretty much how I had imagined it looking from reading the book. The costumes are also wonderful.One (of many) things that I am thoroughly happy about are all of the actors that have been chosen to play each character. I think they chose with care and accuracy. All of them do a wonderful job, especially Jennifer Lawrence. Amazing actually.The soundtrack for this movie is simply wonderful!As far as the violence goes, it is not as violent as the first movie. I would not recommend it for younger kids, depending on what movies they are not allowed to see.Overall, this movie is definitely in my top ten favorites!

Live to fight in another battle again,"The best of the best must fight and survive, again...For me this is a forgettable follow up piece that employs much of the same formula as the first film, which isn't entirely bad - I enjoyed the first film mildly and I also mildly enjoy this film. Again: we see the romance tension because Catness must pretend to love her survival partner. Again: we must form alliances to survive the octagon. Again: crazy costumes. Again: training sequences. There just isn't anything particularly special past a one time viewing. The best aspect of the film is the end, when the story reveals itself to have a much grander scale and importance. So in a lot of ways this is a movie to setup the next movie. I think this is mostly for fans of the book/movie series.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Better than the first and a lot less violent,I went to see the first Hunger Games and though I liked the character of Katniss I was really put off by the excessive violence (especially concerning children) in the movie. I am glad that this continuation of the tale toned some of the violence down and was mostly about grown ups which probably made it more interesting to me. I like the continued political overtones but in this movie I liked Katniss less and felt that everyone else around her seemed more noble than she would ever be. That's kind of bad for a so called heroine. Woody Harrelson was great again and Donald Sutherland always plays evil well. Josh Hutherson excels in the role of Peeta and is as much a focal point of the movie as Katniss. I really don't understand the continued focus of Katniss and Gale's relationship; someone will have to explain that one to me. Though I'm not waiting with baited breath for the next installment I will probably stick with it till the end.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
The girl is still on fire,"The Girl on Fire is back, the Mockingjay and the symbol of hope against a repressive regime returns in The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, a film that fans of the novel will be extremely pleased with.After winning the Games, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) has been suffering nightmares and has been unable to spend time with Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), after it was revealed that her love for him was fake. President Snow (Donald Sutherland) demands Katniss that she needs to keep the presence going, in order to stop an uprising happening in many Districts of Panam. Snow threatens to kill her family, if she does not comply. With many of the Districts rioting, seeing Katniss as a symbol and the Capital citizen looking her as a cultural icon, the new Gamesmaster, Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) advises Snow to bring in more oppressive measures and for the 75th Hunger Games, the Third Quarter Quell, by using the existing pool of winners to fight to death, forcing Katniss and Peeta back into the arena.The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a very loyal adaptation of the novel, only omitting a few elements and adding or expanding scenes. Director Francis Lawrence and writers, Simon Beaufoy and Michael Arndt have taken over the series and the trio keep what worked from the first adaptation, while dropping things like the shaky cam, in order to improve on the quality of this second entry.Francis Lawrence and the writers greatly realise the expanded world of Panam and showing the political situation in the mostly engaging way possible. We get the wide range of political symbolism of the world, the use of the three finger hand symbol, the mockingjay bird and getting quick graces of the rebellion in the screens of a control room. We get to see what events are like on the ground, with the tour of Districts in a montage and the repression used in District 12 with the enforcement of corporal punishment. On the other side of the coin, the citizens in the Capital copy Katniss' style, including Snow's granddaughter, which leads Katniss into becoming a Che Guevara-like figure, where the citizens do not realise what she stands for.The sequel also retains the themes about politics, particularly the media as both Snow and Katniss' team battle each other in the media world, making power plays, in order to get one over the other. Commentaries about the other indulgent society in The Capital is also in play, compared to the poverty that the other Districts live in. Katniss herself has to go through some changes, as she wants to protect her family, but is forced to become this symbol and every action The Capital takes drives her closer to the role.The Hunger Games: Catching Games has a bigger budget then the previous entry and it shows on the screen, as Francis Lawrence is allowed to craft a grander and more expansive world, than director Gary Ross had previously done. Lawrence gets to visit more of Panam and has big wide shots during the opening parade and seeing more of the skyline of The Capital. There is more CGI and Francis Lawrence greatly realizes the topical arena for the games.Lawrence preserves the same colour schemes that Ross used for The Hunger Games, District 12 and the other district being gray, grim and industrial, compared to The Capital being bright and colourful. Lawrence also maintains the same level of violence and brutality of the first movie and the book, such as the flogging scene and does push the 12A rating in the UK during the Quarter Quell (the UK version is uncut).New actors have joined the existing cast of The Hunger Games and the results are mixed. Hoffman is the competent professional that he usually is and Jeffrey Wright is excellent as the intelligent, inventive Beetee, adding plenty of gravitas. Sam Claflin, who won the convened Finnick Odair, continues to be his bland self, ever since he was in Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. Patrick St. Esprit does deserves a special mention, for his gusto and overacting as Commander Thread, the new strict head peacekeeper in District 12.The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is an excellent sequel that improves on the original and should easily pleases fans of the books and the first movie.

Simply a Decent and Fun Movie,"I watched this movie after reading the books, if that adds anything.This is a solid movie, better than the first. It does everything pretty well, from characters to special effects, wich plenty of memorable scenes splattered in. The special effects look fine, and the characters are mostly likable, bar a few. Everything is recreated pretty faithfully from the book, and it works because of this. If they went their own route, this movie would certainly be worse.The music is forgettable and uninspired. I really can't remember any track besides the unecesarry song in the credits. The sound design is passable, but does fail a lot. You'd expect more from a movie like this, and the sound design is really the big failure here.Jennifer Lawrance does a good job in this film, but I'm sad to say that it is not the same for everyone else. The acting as a whole is quite poor, and it sadly makes a lot of scenes unconvincing and much less tense than they should be.The action in this is alright. It works for a movie like this, and is kind of tense. You'll probably enjoy it. The choreography, where there is any, is good and the set design is fun.All in all, you'll enjoy this movie, but don't expect a cinematic masterpiece.

Much better than the first one,"Catching Fire had a lot to live up to. The Hunger Games was a huge hit both with audiences and critics and the books have millions of fans expecting the very best from the movie adaptation. There was so much that could go wrong in Catching Fire including the new arena, the expanding love triangle and the introduction of new, key characters. Luckily nothing, well very little, goes wrong and Catching Fire managed to improve on The Hunger Games in every way.I really liked The Hunger Games, as a movie goer and a fan of the books it ticked most of the boxes for me but the effects were less than amazing and some of the actors were not quite comfortable in their roles. The opening was confusing, especially for those who had not read the books and it could have used a little more polish. Thankfully Catching Fire had all the polish but managed to keep all the great things from The Hunger Games.Catching Fire picks up not long after themHunger Games. Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) are back in District 12 and barely talking to each other, they are both struggling to come to terms with what they experienced in the area. They are trying to get on with their lives but the ever present and often drunk Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) is a reminder that the experience of the games doesn't just fade away. In the capital President Snow (Donald Sutherland) and new game maker Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) are trying to stop the start of a revolution that was sparked by Katniss' actions in The Hunger Games.Catching Fire is a darker and meaner affair than its predecessor. It pushes the boundaries of its 12 rating and there are moments of awful and menacing violence that surprisingly mainly appear out of the arena, as we get to see how very dangerous and disturbing President Snow's leadership really is. One moment in particular when Katniss and Peeta visit District 11 the home of their former allies Rue and Thresh is moving and utterly disturbing. Francis Lawrence has delivered a film that is both exciting and touching. The arena is not the only place where people are fighting for their lives and we are constantly reminded that Snow will go to any length to prevent his control from slipping. It is not always an easy watch.The acting was one of the great triumphs of this movie and is what sets the Hunger Games franchise apart from its other teen counterparts. Jennifer Lawrence seems to get better and better with everything she appears in. Katniss is wounded and defenceless in this and the emotional toll is plain to see in Lawrence's captivating and surly performance. Other stand outs are Donald Sutherland and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Their conversations about how to 'end' Katniss are chilling yet subtle and are some of the best moments in the movie.Elizabeth Banks' Effie Trinket is one of the most improved characters from the first movie. Here she is given a little more emotional depth and she handles that brilliantly whilst still being her larger than life 'that is mahogany' self. Another improvement came from Josh Hutcherson who has really settled into Peeta's character. I thought he did alright in the first movie but he looks much more comfortable here and manages to hold his own impressively. Catching Fire is where you really start to see what kind of person Peeta is, you see how he is the good in a world full of bad and that really came across well in the movie.Out of all the new characters (of which there are many) it is Sam Claflin's Finnick Odair and Jena Malone's Johanna Mason that really shine. Finnick and Johanna are my favourite characters from the books so I was nervous that this casting might not work. Claflin is perfect as Finnick, he is devastatingly good looking, charming, yet manages to show off Finnick's massive vulnerable side. If you think what Katniss and Peeta have been through is bad it is nothing in comparison to Finnick and Sam Claflin did a great job at brining that sadness to the character. Mason is perfect as the potty mouthed and opinionated Johanna and she has some of the best and most humorous moments in the movie.But it wasn't all perfect. Gale (Liam Hemsworth) was given very little screen time and you never got to see the evolution of that character. It is in Catching Fire where he begins to come into his own but that was muted in the movie version and he was little more than someone for Jennifer Lawrence to kiss. Also I am still unconvinced that Lenny Kravitz was a great casting choice as Cinna. His performance is a little cardboard and because of that one of the moments that made me ball my eyes in the books had little effect on me whilst watching the movie.So many sequels fail to live up to the first movie in the series but Catching Fire is not one of them. It is a million times better than The Hunger Games and is a clear indication that this franchise is not going to falter any time soon.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

A Sequel That Manages to Be Better Than the Original,"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) don't have much time to celebrate their victory in the 74th Hunger Games because their win starts a revolution that President Snow (Donald Sutherland) doesn't want. The latest edition of the Hunger Games have previous winners being forced to play once again. THE HUNGER GAMES: CATCHING FIRE is a very rare sequel that actually manages to be better than the original film. The original picture was certainly very good but this one here is just so much deeper and draws you much more into the story, the characters and the relationships going on. I will admit that I've never read any of the books so I can't compare this film to them. In some ways I guess this gives me a fresh and clear look at the movies and it's really surprising at how much you care about these lead characters. You certainly care about their struggles in regards to the love story but everything involving their roles in possibly rising up against the empire is also very entertaining. It certainly doesn't hurt that we're given some excellent performances with Lawrence and Hutcherson leading the way. The two of them work extremely well together and no matter if they're battling enemies or each other, you believe both of them and their relationship. The supporting cast is excellent as you'd expect with Sutherland, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Lenny Kravitz, Stanley Tucci and Phillip Seymour Hoffman all doing find work. The film also works better than the original when it comes to the special effects. You can tell that much more money went into the effects here and this leads to some wonderful moments. The sets are all extremely good as are the scenes at the start when we see the poor villages. THE HUNGER GAMES: CATCHING FIRE doesn't have as much action as the first film and obviously it's just building to the conclusion of the story but it's highly entertaining even through its long running time.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

"""Fire is Catching.""","""Fire is Catching,"" and it has certainly become a blazing inferno. As an avid movie lover and specifically a huge fan of the Hunger Games franchise, I was looking forward to the movie ever since the credits on the first installment began to roll. Having read the book, the first film was initially a disappointment, but I began to love it as I stopped the comparisons and understood that movies and books cannot be exactly the same. That being said, ""Catching Fire"" surpasses the first film in every single way. From the first scene, it is apparent that Francis Lawrence and the screenwriters were going to make an effort to stay with the storyline of the book. Although there were, of course, differences, the script of ""Catching Fire"" follows the book closely. The acting in the film is near perfect, from Mags' lack of words to the facial expressions of the characters during important scenes. Jennifer Lawrence, who has now easily become one of my favorite actresses, reprises her role as the heroine Katniss Everdeen. Lawrence brings so much emotion to her character that I felt was absent from the first film. Every feeling that Everdeen felt, from rage to sympathy to love, was beautifully crafted and brought to life by Lawrence. From this role alone, Jennifer Lawrence has crafted herself as one of the best actresses of our current generation. Josh Hutcherson also reprises his role with so much more character development than the first film. He gives his character Peeta so much more depth and complexity and made viewers feel sympathy in his battle for Katniss's heart. The other returning actors, who I felt had already given their characters enough development from the first film, also give new depth and emotional strain to their characters, particularly Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrellson, and Elizabeth Banks. The new actors to the franchise were greatly cast, with specific praise to Sam Claflin as Finnick and Jena Malone as Johanna. Claflin and Malone really got a feel of who their characters are and convey them exactly as I had imagined while reading the book. The arena in ""Catching Fire"" is also much more exciting, with beautiful scenery and CGI effects that fit perfectly with the scenes. The IMAX inclusion of the entire arena sequence was much needed, as it gives a sense of authenticity and beauty as the climactic events unfold. The progressing brutality of the Capitol is also fantastically depicted in the film, which gave the audience a deeper understanding of the rebellion. I must also give credit to Donald Sutherland, who returns as President Snow and gives his character so much more wickedness and evil that was already clearly apparent in the first film. At just shy of two and a half hours, ""Catching Fire"" flies by. Although there are a lot of repetitive elements from the first film, i.e. chariot ride, interviews, every aspect is necessary to understand the events that lead up to the shocking and unexpected (if you haven't read the book) climax. Overall, ""Catching Fire"" has been a hit at box offices across the globe, and there is no question as to why. With amazing acting, an exciting story full of hope, pain, sorrow, and love, gorgeous scenery, brilliant musical scores, and a conclusion that will leave viewers breathless and impatiently awaiting the next installment, ""Catching Fire"" is sure to be a hit to any viewer with good taste in films. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
A great movie but with some noticeable faults,"*I have read the books so this review may be biased.I'll try not to sound like a book snob because I despise people who compare novels to the film adaptations. However, my main problem with this iteration of the Hunger Games series was the pacing.The beginning of the film immediately establishes the harsh circumstances of which Katniss, Peeta, and those of district 12 are forced into. Also it establishes Katniss' complex relationships between her family, friends, and most importantly her lovers, which she tries desperately to balance. However, soon after the main characters have been established the film seems to go into hyper drive as it jumps from a somber moment between Katniss and her family to her and Peeta heading off on their victory tour. And this is my biggest complaint about the film.The film seemed like it tried to fit too much of the narrative, from the novel, into the first hour. But I will give credit to the writers, the novel does contain many heavy handed themes and narrative plots that would have easily made this film even longer. Yet, I felt disoriented when the film would build up one scene and suddenly cut forward and jump to the next. Characters would be introduced without much build-up, and certain shot locations that would be ideal to create tension between characters would only be seen for minutes before the next scene was introduced. But the worst offense was the editing of the dialogues. I'm sure that not many people had problems with the dialogue, however, I was taken out of several moments mainly because of the timing of characters responses. When a character would ask a question it would be answered immediately with an impromptu response that was perfectly delivered, and due to the camera placement it felt like the actors were reading from a test manuscript rather than fluidly interacting with one-another. Again this is probably a personal preference, but adding both the jumping from scene to scene and the awkward dialogue cuts made the film feel like it was playing at 1.5x speed.But the film regains it's footing once the contestants are in the arena. The second half of the film does an amazing job in recreating some of the most memorable moments from the book, and even causing me to squeeze my armrest from the intense action sequences. Also, some of the character development that should have been utilized in the first half of the movie is properly employed in the second half.To wrap things up, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is an admirable attempt and a serviceable sequel to the superior first film. Although my review may lead you to believe that the film is disjointed and unorganized, it still maintains to be an entertaining film. It's grittier, more violent, and double the bad-ass Jennifer Lawrence you could ask for. And running at around 2 1/2 hours you'll definitely get your moneys worth and this film is by far the best holiday blockbuster of 2013.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
I actually liked it better than the original,"I loved the movie, but what I don't like is that people think it's a ripoff of Battle Royale (which I guess is true, but not completely and exactly the same) Catching Fire is awesome, I loved the cast (especially the new ones) and the action is pretty amazing. But why do people think it's a ripoff of Battle Royale?!! It's not the same, sure it shares similar traits, but that doesn't make it a ripoff. But it's awesome, and sorry, but it seems better than Twilight (not completely sure, never saw Twilight, so I can't guarantee that.)Anyway, the characters are awesome, the Quarter Quell is a twist that was awesome. And, no more shaky cameras (even though I didn't notice that very well.) This film is by far the best of the franchise.

Enjoyable,"Actually a pretty good film. The ending may disappoint some but the film and the end has to be taken in the context of knowing it is a trilogy ( I say that as I haven't read the books and am not sure how many there are. Remember they made the hobbit it into two films so who knows what they will do to make money!). I like the concept of the series, it mixes up modern concepts of the cult of celebrity with good old systems of control employed by any 20th century dictator. Unlike some reviewers, I did care about the actors and even the bit part hunger games contestants, the development comes from watching both films so don't watch with seeing the first one. Plus, if you can't feel something for the situation these guys are in, I would question your sanity! I should also point out, living in a violent dictatorship is not conducive to spilling emotions and feelings around wily billy, if the characters had it would ring oddly.remember it is scifi, don't expect technological reality! I note some reviewers comment on implausibility, sci if/fantasy films should be avoided if one doesn't want implausibility! putting someone in a coma for two days without securing an airway is rather dangerous so I don't see much difference in the unreality of that vs killer fog cleansed by water!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

It was not only a lovely follow up to the first that I enjoyed it, but it converted my brother who saw the first but wasn't sure how to feel about the movie and was enough of a stand alone movie that my father was able to enjoy and understand it without seeing The Hunger Games. 10/10 I cannot rave about how much I loved it and how perfect it was!!!

Better than the first one.,"Review #3.I was not very much happy with the first movie. So I didn't go to see it in a theatre. I saw it on my laptop. And I have to say, it is much better than the previous one.The second installment of the Hunger Games Trilogy, The Hunger Games - Catching Fire is very sharply adapted from the book. The conversations, the scenarios and all other things just work perfectly for the film. The film starts with the victor tour of Katniss and Peeta. They see that things are changed in the districts. Due to these events, somehow, the third Quarter-Quell is designed in a way so that Katniss is in the games again. What happens next is the main plot.Talking about the performances, Jennifer Lawrence is in top form. Others provide good support.The direction is superb. The music is good too. The visual effects bring beauty to the film.At last, I will say that it is a pleasant watch with good suspense, fine visuals and superlative performances.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Remember Who The Enemy Is,"I read Catching Fire even before the first Hunger Games movie came out and I was impressed with the whole series, not only The Hunger Games. Is the movie adaptation of Catching Fire worthy of the book?My answer is yes. In many ways, it surpasses the book. Jennifer Lawrence, who has no relation to the director Frances Lawrence, breathes life into the character of Katniss and no one could play it better. There is no question that Jennifer Lawrence is perfectly cast and an amazing actress who has not only proved her abilities in this film and the original The Hunger Games but last years Silver Linings Playbook and the indie gem Winter's Bone. She brings the ferocity necessary to her role but not only brings what is necessary but adds to the character which is the best an actress or actor can do.The supporting cast, lead by Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Lenny Kravitz and Donald Sutherland are all great. The only actress I had a problem with was Jena Malone because although she shined her some scenes, particularly her interview with Stanley Tucci's hilarious game-show host character, Caeser Flickerman, she overacted a lot in the arena. Josh Hutcherson gives a strong performance as Peeta, also.Francis Lawrence breathes new life into the film and although doing a tremendous job, I'm surprised that he was chosen as the director. So many crazy-talented directors were considered such as Alfonso Cuaron, director of this year's Gravity which is thought to be a tough competitor for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Special Effects, Tomas Alfredson, director of one of the best vampire films ever made, Let the Right One In, and Bennett Miller, director of the 2011 success Moneyball and Capote, starring Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Then you have Lawrence, the director of the decent I Am Legend but I have to say, he did an outstanding job. The arena scenes are intense as they should be and the ideas that were only explored a tiny bit in the first are almost completely fleshed out. He made a thought-provoking and insanely entertaining film.My only complaint is the writing. I loved how it completely dove into these darker ideas that were always kind of lurking in the shadows in the first film but in the second one, they're fully exposed but the love scenes between Katniss and Peeta can get pretty cheesy. Luckily, the actors have the skill to make them more bearable.I really did like The Hunger Games: Catching Fire and I thought it was better than the original source material and the first film so if the movies go at this rate, this will probably be a film series that many more are compared to in terms of quality.I give The Hunger Games: Catching Fire an A-.Read all of my reviews at www.thecheapseatsfilmreviews.weebly.com!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Not as good as the first,The second installment of the Hunger Games Trilogy was really a bit of a letdown. I was anticipating a really good movie after reading all of the rave reviews on IMDb but was sorely disappointed. The first half of the movie moves really slow and by the time you get to the action scenes at the end of the movie it feels rushed. The movie probably needed an extra 30 minutes or so in order to give you a better feel for the new characters introduced in this movie. They deviated from the book in several scenes but nothing that was too horribly distorted. The acting in this movie also took a step back. The characters didn't seem as believable in this film and you don't get enough time for this movie to develop the supporting roles. Overall it was okay but it was by far the best book and unfortunately it fell way short of expectations.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Really good!,"Release Date: November 22, 2013 Director: Francis Lawrence Writers: Simon Beaufoy and Michael deBruyn Starring: Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrleson, Elizabeth Banks, Lenny Kravitz, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Jeffery Wright, Stanley Tucci, Sam Claffin, Donald Sutherland Runtime: 146 minutes (2 hours and 26 minutes) Studio: Lionsgate MPAA Rating: PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action, some frightening images, thematic elements, a suggestive situation and language.I finally saw THE HUNGER GAMES: CATCHING FIRE during senior exams last Friday at my school and I had to say, I was expecting the worst book-to-film adaptation movie ever made, but it was really cool to see this film and I got so energized by it and I really loved the first film.The plot takes place a few months after the previous installment, Katniss Everdeen has now returned home safely after winning the 74th Annual Hunger Games along with fellow tribute and lover, Peeta Mellark. Throughout the story, Katniss senses that a rebellion against the oppresive Capitol is slimering through the districts.First, let's go on with the story. I may not have read the book, but the movie is just really cool from my point of view and I really loved this film and the character development is just amazingly well done and the acting is amazing this time around.The acting is stronger than the acting in the first HG. Jennifer Lawrence is great as Katniss once again. Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth are cool as their returning characters. Lenny Kravitz, Sam Claffin, Elizabeth Banks, Donald Sutherland and the returning and new cast members are just amazing as they were in the previous film. The newest addition is the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman, may God rest his soul, as his character and I really thought he was amazing in this film.If you hated the shaky cam in the first film, that is gone. The action sequences are all very well shot with IMAX cameras and I was impressed this time around. The direction by Francis Lawrence (director of I Am Legend) was really cool and much better than Gary Ross' direction of the first film.Now the script: The script is actually amazing and I will not go into details about the script, but the way the scriptwriters wrote this film was simply amazing and I could not have been happier with that either and the dialogue is NOT ANNOYING as in some of today's other movies.The music in this film is awesome and the soundtrack was really amazing an I think James Newton Howard's score is really amazing in this film. The song ""Atlas"" by Coldplay, I was hoping to hear, but I did not see the full film all the way until the end credits, so I'll try to find it.Overall, while the first HUNGER GAMES was OK and had some major flaws, this one is totally flawless. There is no other way to describe and I hope to see Mockingjay : Part I before Part II comes out this November and I hope it is not another rip-off of The Final Destination.The film is getting a 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
A great sequel,"I don't get why this film is receiving so much hate. It is a sequel that is better than the original. The new director definitely helps the franchise. The whole cast shines: Jennifer Lawrence is great as feisty Katniss, Woddy Harrelson is superb as drunk Haymitch and Elizabeth Banks is superb as the eccentric Effie. The special effects are superb and I especially the arty kind of effect when you see the arena for the first time. The only negative thing I wouuld have to say would be the slightly fast and the cliffhanger like ending which makes you scream for the next one. It is a great sequel and it surpasses the original because the first on e was slightly disappointing. The outfits and costume design is amazing and Donald Sutherland is mesmerising as the calculating as President Snow.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Suffers as Setup to next film in Trilogy,"Having not read any of the books, and seeing a trend here (Ender's GAME), or a trailer shown before this film (Divergent), they all reflect what the latest generation is reading therefore finding as the preferred escapism. Here it is the blend of teenage rebellion and teenage emotional struggles with relationships. As important as this is in understanding what drives a character, I once again thought it unnecessary to drag the film over two hours. No question it was the second act where we seem to be building up to the next big event, only for Katniss for some reason popping up back home to get some more quality time with her loved ones. This second act obviously wanted to be longer, as subplot after subplot accumulated, especially around Philip Seymour Hoffman's character (a fresh baddie). Yet the expected resolution of these subplots are either skipped over or lightly touched upon. The third act thankfully found a lot of fresh dynamics to the actual game. This prevents a been-there-done-that sequel pitfall. For the most part, I felt this film was no better or worse than the first film, which I reluctantly liked.Hand it to the able creative and technical crew, with perhaps only a handful of CGI shots that looked iffy. Jennifer Lawrence does her best looking frightened most of the time, thankfully the brutality that was just hinted in the first film is hinted just a little more for PG-13. The biggest problem is the story, suffering from the middling 2nd part of a trilogy. The story isn't allowed to get too far in the resolution of the anticipated confrontation. So that forces many characters to remain in a holding pattern as the wheels spin for an extra half hour beyond the normal running time. As for the sequel bait, the same complaint can be made for many other recent last second revelations. It is a table turning moment that would have made the film we've just watched far more interesting. It reminds me of the long dragged out process over three films for Anakin Skywalker to become Darth Vader. It took two long films for him to just lose his hand! I think others in the audience had the same letdown as I did about the ending hinting at more interesting fireworks to come.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Good Movie Adaptation,"This movie is a great adaptation of the book! Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson were great as their roles, and the acting was spot-on.

The District 12 set was great as usual. Haymitch and Effie are great actors. Catching Fire was my favorite book, and now the Catching Fire movie is my favorite out of the movies. The ending of the movie was great, so was the beginning and middle. I was very happy with this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire and Lacking Heat,"This film is mildly recommended.The second installment of The Hunger Games took a L-O-N-G time to ""catch fire"". The first hour and a half were a mere retread of the first film, setting up the same tired formula of ""them against us"". The theme of oppression continues to run deep in this saga, and I found the film oppressively smug. Seeing the same totalitarian state with its absurd and garish upper class taking advantage of the down-trodden lower class just grew monotonous and downright silly.The plot of The Hunger Games: Catching Fire still centers around the blood sport of the games, although its violence remains toned down for its targeted teenage PG-13 audience. In this sanitized sequel, the government is concerned about a possible rebellion from the working class peons and our heroine, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), becoming their spokesperson and savior. With that in mind, the evil leader of Panem, President Snow (Donald Sutherland) decides that Katniss is a problem that needs to be eliminated, along with her pretend boyfriend and former Hunger Games surviving partner, Peeta (Josh Hutcherson). So a new scheme is hatched to renew the arena killings once again in order to put our spunky gal in harm's way. (In this sequel, no longer is it just teenagers stalking their peers. Now death has no age limit. Why, there's even a granny thrown into the mix. This version of the Hunger Games is an equal opportunity employer.)Although this film has a new director this time around, Francis Lawrence, it's still the same old rehash, even if it's handled competently. The screenplay is serviceable at best, as are the production values. (I did enjoy some of the amusing over-the-top costume designs by Trish Summerville.)The film does have stronger performances than the first chapter did. The actors bring more energy to their one-dimensional roles. Particularly strong are Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, and a comic Stanley Tucci. Sutherland is given more screen time and he makes a most vivid impression as the menacing overlord. However, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Lenny Kravitz, Liam Hemsworth, and especially Toby Jones add little to the film. New cast members include the aforementioned Hoffman, Jena Malone, and Sam Claflin as the kindly stud. Ho-hum.As the two leads, Hutcherson is overshadowed by Lawrence, which is how it should be to enable those young female moviegoers to relate to the main character. Lawrence is a talented actress and she truly delivers a strong full-bodied performance, making the role more credible than it deserves. Hutcherson's Peeta is as bland as, well, pita.But it is not until the hunger games actually begin that the film becomes interesting and, dare I say, somewhat exciting. (That's the last hour of the film, so come late and you'll enjoy the film even more.) The jungle setting has the right level of creepiness and there is one sequence that is the film's highlight: a very well-edited segment involving a baboon attack that supplies the missing excitement that is sorely needed after the film's leisurely and lengthy beginnings.The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a slow burn indeed.

Great reviews a mystery...,"I am at a complete loss as to why this movie has garnered such good reviews...My wife and I saw the movie last night inside a packed theater. Upon the appearance of the credits following the movie, we overheard many fans of the first film lament how they found the sequel to be both boring and tedious. I must agree. While I was not a huge fan of the 1st film, I did find that it held my interest most of the time - despite having cringe-worthy dialogue and gaping plot holes. That said, I decided to give the sequel a chance after reading review-after-review praising the new film, most stating that the sequel was significantly better than the first. Say what?Along with my fellow movie-goers, I found the first 2/3 of the movie to be an exercise in staying awake - bad dialogue (again) and even less character development than the first movie - all adding up to ""I don't care what happens to these people!"" Only when Donald Sutherland, Philip Seymour Hoffman or Woody Harrelson were on screen was I able to stifle a yawn - they're just fun to watch. Too bad their screen time was minimal...The last 1/3 of the movie was far more interesting than the first 2/3 yet it seemed to be a replay (plot-wise) of the 1st movie. Curiously enough, I have watched several movies from the 1970's and 1980's with very similar plot-lines (some made-for-TV) that better held my attention and had significantly better dialogue. Perhaps if the time and money spent on over-the-top CGI and special effects was instead invested in creating a tight script with charismatic actors playing the leads, the result would be far more satisfying.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

Style Improves & Still True To Book,"The first ""Hunger Games"" movie's popularity to each person ran roughly equal to their enjoyment of the written works. Essentially, how much you liked/disliked the book was exactly how much you liked/disliked the movie. With ""Catching Fire"", however, director Francis Lawrence actually turns in what may very well be a superior product to Suzanne Collins' tome.For a basic plot summary, ""Catching Fire"" sees Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) back from their original Hunger Games experience now living on ""Panem's dime"" while on the promotional tour for the next games. When President Snow (Donald Sutherland) doesn't like the symbol that Katniss may be turning into, he rigs the upcoming Quarter Quell (75th edition of the Games) with a special new set of rules unprecedented in the history of the event.While the first ""Hunger Games"" movie was impressive in its own right, I believe that ""Catching Fire"" is superior because it is a bit more ""versatile"". The original movie was very dark in tone and serious throughout. I have read all the books, so I completely realized that the tone is quite serious, but I really appreciated the lighter moments of ""Catching Fire"", those moments when I felt like it was okay to laugh or smile at something that was transpiring.The main cog in making the machine work is Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss. Other great performances from characters like Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth), Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci), and Primrose Everdeen (Willow Shields) are packed with subtle nuances all their own, but it is truly Lawrence who holds this whole thing together. Her screen presence alone is a force to be reckoned with. Even if her portrayal of Katniss is quite a bit different (at least physical) from how she is portrayed in the books, Lawrence has easily made the character entirely her own.Thus, while the first movie in this series whetted my appetite for more, ""Catching Fire"" satiated the hunger by mixing some brevity and wit into some deadly serious subject matter. It changes the style of the series-so-far while also staying pretty true to the source material.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

"Great, but brainless at times","The first half of the movie is great. The atmosphere is very well designed, the acting is great, and it does a perfect job of drawing you in.The second half isn't quite as flawless. Much like in the first movie, where the extra actors had been picked up from Starbucks and were attempting to read a script their first time, here too many extra characters were poorly done. The majority of ""past contestants"" were completely hollow caricatures of personalities. Basically throwaways to move the plot along.The other problem was that the final plot made no sense. When the ending is revealed it is completely absurd; there were a million reasons it should not have worked. Maybe they explain it better in the book, but if you have not read it, the movie explanation sounds pathetic. I can't say more without spoilers, you'll see.Even with these two flaws - occasional poor acting and an unbelievable plot - the movie was much better than I expected.

Adaptation is faithful and lacking at the same time,"Just look at all those book adapted movies these years, then you'll find this one goes surprisingly faithful to the book. They actually copied important dialog from the book down to every word (for example, Katniss and Snow).
But this is a 2 hour movie, not a 10 hour TV series like ""My Brilliant Friend"". There is simply no way to copy every detail from the book. And by taking out discontinued pieces like this, the whole adaptation lacks a soul, seems more like patching up Frankenstein.

May the odds never be in your favour.,"For me that was definitely better than the first one and most of the people will agree , simply because of the advancement of the whole thing, The technology, Thw CGI , the script , the dialogue everything had a good sense in this motion picture.The movie has a great plot now because the Hunger games has reached 75 years they now do a quarter celebration where they take all of the winners into the final and most challenging hunger game they will ever witness they encounter a lot of obstacles and stuff and they have to survive in the virtual domeThe acting is very good also Jennifer Lawrence she killed it her acting is good and so as the other cast especially woody harrelson all cast did a good job.Overall solid film with a bit of a confusing ending but overall it was enjoyable ! 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Catching Fire - Noodles Review,"We all know that it's going to make big bucks from all those devout fans of the books and just the teen populace of the world. But I learned that there's hope for the quality of the movies in the series. So, we left off in the first movie that Katniss and Peeta won the Hunger Games, and the way they did it gave way for people to get the hope to rebel against the oppressive government in this world. Let's talk about the world for a second. The world that Suzanne Collins has established is actually impressive and interesting. I really dig the lore and how everything came to be, as well as the overall atmosphere of it. This movie gets that atmosphere right. The tone throughout the beginning of this movie is spot-on and I was afraid that wouldn't get it right, because the first movie didn't quite do it. I liked the first movie to a certain degree; it did hit some good notes, but I personally don't feel like it did the source material the right amount of justice. Catching Fire, takes almost a 180- degree turn, because this is SO much better! First off, they build off of the good things in the first movie, and then they improve on some of the weak points, and I think that's a lot due to the new director because I could definitely tell that this was directed differently (for the better, though). The camera angles are a lot better, as well as the tone and placement of everything; especially the pacing. Pacing was a major problem for me in the first movie because I don't think I should be getting bored during a movie about a government-orchestrated fight to the death between teenagers in a post- apocalyptic world. But I did. Sigh. The pacing is much better in this sequel. I was invested throughout more of the movie. And here's what you've all been waiting for... wait for it... the violence in on screen! In the first movie, almost all the violence was off-screen so we didn't even see what happened; it was more-so implied. That deters the viewers from caring as much for what happened. Being able to see the actual cuts, injuries, hits, and deaths, really adds more to the emotion and investment in the film.That is also thanks to the acting because that's also great. Jennifer Lawrence has obviously proved herself as a credible actress now. We know she's great as Katniss. But I was really surprised by her in the beginning of the movie. You really begin to feel bad for Katniss and she effectively portrays her post-traumatic stress and stubbornness. What really surprised me was Josh Hutcherson. Wow, man, give yourself a pat on the back. He improved so much. In the first movie, I gave him a lot of crap since his acting was so wooden and ineffective. Back then he was just a pretty face. He's really improved, because I genuinely cared for his character in this movie, maybe even more than for Katniss at some points. Their little entourage in the Hunger Games is quite fleshed out and distinctive as well. It's inevitable that everyone's gonna love Finnick (or Aquaman as I called him). My favorite character, however, is Plutarch Heavensby, the game-master, and plots with President Snow on how to get rid of Katniss; their conversation on how to get that done is probably my favorite scene in the whole movie. He's played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, one of my favorite actors. Caesar, as well as pretty much all of the supporting cast is acted well. The only characters I sort of have a problem with are the the tributes from districts 1 and 2. I understand that they're supposed to be formidable foes, but this movie honestly doesn't play them as anything else; it feels like they're just there to be bad guys.Unfortunately, like the first movie, the pace slows down when the Hunger Games actually start out. This is a bit of a letdown because it's a little weird that the movie slows down when the ""action"" actually begins. Not only that, but the quality of the movie takes a bit of a dip as well. Yet by this point, it is a realization that the actual Hunger Games aren't the basis of the series. The Hunger Games event itself is a tool to help tell the story; it's a vehicle to propel the actual conflicts. That conflict is oppression and revolution. And this is one of the main reasons I like the book series. It's layered and has elements of politics on top of all this action and stuff. It's not just black and white wherein a good guy is trying to beat a bad guy. Catching Fire really started to show that, whereas one of my main problems with its predecessor was the lack of this layering. So up to the Hunger Games, we have actual dramatic conflict occurring, and it keeps us intrigued most of the way leading up to the games. The scope of the film was great until then, and I really felt more connected to the characters before it happened. Speaking of scope, there are some moments in the film that really make it feel more epic, and truly escalate the experience; this is part due to a great blend of sweeping cinematography and strong musical score. The score in this movie is definitely much stronger than that of the first movie since the music is actually memorable. I guess we could sum up this movie that way, because it's overall just more memorable than the first installment of the franchise. Catching Fire is a more exciting and more layered film that not only houses more intrigue, but also more cinematic prowess. Despite it having some obvious conveniences and other downfalls, Catching Fire is definitely a step in the right direction for the series",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Disappointing,"I don't think this would work well as a stand alone movie for someone who hasn't read the books. It isn't the performers' fault; they give it their all, or a little bit more. There are some fundamental script problems.First,the PG-13 rating. Haymitch is a very sober drunk, and we don't see Katniss get hammered with him when the QQ is announced. No avoxes. Peeta has two good legs. Cray isn't an exploiter of young girls.Second, not enough hunger. Katniss is extremely conscious of food. The party scene works as well as it does in the book because , despite herself, she really enjoys the delicacies she's eating. That makes her revulsion over the vomit producing drink even stronger, because it stops her from being seduced by the Capitol's luxuries. In the movie it has to be spelled out.Third, the books have texture because of the way Katniss interacts with minor characters: her prep team, Cray, Darius, Madge, Hazelle, Greasy Sae, even Prim's cat that she can't stand. As in Casablanca, the bit players provide color and background that make the major characters stand out. That's missing in the script, which is why we never get a sense of the community Katniss comes from that has made her who she it. The destruction of the Hob doesn't matter because we never see it in operation, and we don't miss District 12 because we barely get to know it from a few establishing shots of industrial squalor.So we get a workmanlike portrayal of the major plot points, while the reader provides depth that isn't on the screen.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
This is the Revolution,"The sequel continues Katniss Everdeen's journey as she rises to prominence as a symbol of resistance to Panem's oppressive regime. The narrative focuses on the political conflicts and injustices that exist in the districts as well as how people are gaining the courage to stand up against the Capitol. It is engrossing and draws the audience in. It was devastating to watch because after winning their games and being promised they would never have to compete again as a form of punishment, the capitol broke their promise. President Snow introduced the idea of the 75th anniversary and having all the champions compete to incite fear.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Catching Fire is a great improvement over The Hunger Games, and the best film in the franchise.","This could easily have been a repeat of the first story; what this film does well is act as a bridge from the battle royale gimmick towards the politics and rebellion coming to the forefront.Immediately the cinematography is better. The capitol looks vibrant, stunning and disturbing. The shaky cam is thankfully gone. It's rare for such a drastically positive leap in presentation inside a franchise. The scene that transitions into IMAX ratio is really quite incredible.The caliber of actors also increases with the addition of Plutarch, played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, continuing the solid casting of this series.The writing and editing are a step up as well; scenes flow into each other logically and no cuts feel as jarring as the other entries in the franchise.I do however find the love triangle still incredibly tedious and unnecessary. Sad Gale is a super boring character, and all time spent with him feels wasted to me.The score also feels pretty perfunctory - nothing wows me like Harry Potter's incredible soundtracks (sue me, it's the gold standard for young adult film series).The CGI mandrills didn't look great and my last complaint (I did quite like the film, honest) is that the reasoning for the selection of champions felt rather contrived.Overall Catching Fire really does elevate its source material, and justifies its existence by taking logical steps into becoming something more than a battle royale.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

Even better than the first!,"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is the second movie in the Hunger Games film franchise, and it continues the story of Katniss Everdeen as she becomes a symbol of hope and rebellion against the tyrannical government of Panem. The story is captivating and draws the audience in, providing a deeper exploration of the themes presented in the first film and novels that they are based on. It focuses on the political struggles and injustices present in the world and how people can unite to overthrow tyrants. The production of the film is exceptional, with stunning cinematography and visual effects that enhance the experience of the story. The script is well-written, capturing the essence of the source novel material. The lighting and tones are also noteworthy, creating a moody and atmospheric tone that highlights the themes of the film.

A mixed result,"This futuristic American science-fiction is the second in a quadrilogy. In this segment, a young woman and man are considered heroes for having won a gladiatorial battle in the first segment. Their government tries to control them for their own purposes.The first half is very intriguing. It parallels past and modern societies whose people are controlled by tyrants. Some scenes are frighteningly relevant: using celebrity/royal weddings to distract the populace from the real problems in their lives; and a very cheeky take-off on competitive reality shows.The second half is a radical change from the first in a ""Survivor""-like contest in a jungle. Some of it is thrilling and adventurous but the later part has so many characters and incidents, it becomes hard to keep track.

Dystopian but no fear,"This second chapter rewrites more or less the first one, with an apocalyptic fights in the arena.

But this good elements are not at the service of a well done narrative development, that goes without an anxious feeling that instead should be in a dystopian world like this. Characters reactions are not guided by serious fears or sorrows and all the protagonists results static: the interesting dystopian place described is not impregnated by a terrible feeling that instead we have to expect. In this second movie, moreover, the love plot is more presented but, for the same reasons now expressed, it sounds artificial and moralistic, without a real deraglement of the feelings in a horrible situation like the Hunger Games one.

"Catching Fire works better the idea of a darker dystopian future, move the franchise ahead and discuss important tpics of our society","With the success achieved by the franchise in cinema, it was given carte blanche for this ""Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" to explore the dystopian universe of Panem in a deeper way and to raise the punishments and challenges imposed on heroes at various levels, in a more cinematic experience. heavy and courageous, precisely because of its politicized nature, something very rare among blockbusters aimed at the youth audience. With the change of direction and an almost unhealthy injection of money (Catching Fire it cost twice as much as the first), two of the original's biggest problems have been completely solved: the camera-in-hand steering and the special effects. Francis Lawrence works action without trying to invent and, in this way, is very efficient in clearly identifying the characters and, when necessary, creating the suspense that the tape requires. The director still does well by joining action scenes, which do not hide the violence of the environment, with others of a certain contemplation. There are several moments when we stop to observe the beauty of the place, either in the forest next to the district where everyone struggles to survive, or in games where the goal is to kill the person next to you. On the side of the effects, we no longer see the terrible ""genetically altered dogs"" of the climax of the first film and, in their place, we are introduced to very convincing mandrels (a kind of baboon with a colorful snout that actually exists), in addition to shots of the Capital and Arena that actually work.Contrary to many sequels that seem to get worse, ""Catching Fire"" brings new elements and great developments to the story of Katniss Everdeen. Helped by a book that was certainly designed by Suzanne Collins to have a cinematic structure, and bypassing elements that could take the focus away from the games and psychological conflicts of the characters - like gigantic and empty set pieces or even the tasteless love triangle Katniss-Peeta-Gale (Liam Hemsworth) - we have the great script by Simon Beaufoy (127 Hours) and Michael Arndt (Little Miss Sunshine and Toy Story 3) even though he doesn't have the courage to take any chances. Everything in the book is in the movie. The dialogues are there intact, the sequences in the exact order of the novel, the action scenes, the sacrifices, the secrets, the twists and turns: it is like watching the book in motion. Usually, this is a problem, because the production, excited about the success of the first film and the legion of fans, could have easily set foot in their hands, but in Hunger Games: Catching Fire, the biggest consequence of all this loyalty is a film longer than necessary, plague, incidentally, that fell on the first as well. However, this problem does not detract from the narrative's vigor when it actually begins, although that beginning takes too long to happen and a montage a little less concerned with fan reaction could have prevented it.The second film is much more than ""people in an arena trying to kill each other"". While the original was basically an American version of the Japanese Battle Royale, the new one invests heavily in political history and in building a climate for the impending revolution. Here, Katniss deals with the consequences of what she was forced to do by the government in the first feature. These consequences are precisely what move the plot, both for the character and for the nation under a totalitarian state controlled by the lush and powerful Capital. The consequences bring responsibilities - and the theme of the dystopian future, in which each citizen indulges in the daily struggle of survival, gains more epic contours while the government encircles freedom of expression with a firm pulse, dispatching scouts to the streets to control demonstrations and keep if in power.Definitely, the biggest success of the film is to accept the dark tone and know how to work it, considering that some adaptations tend to soften the darker content of a work. Following the format of the first film, the first part (more than the first hour of projection) is dedicated almost exclusively to presenting the new situation and developing the characters of this ""new universe"". Giving space also to present new characters that will be of great importance from that part of the games onwards, showing that The Hunger Games was a child thing. It is also important to highlight how the script treats the protagonist. The events of the first film did not go unnoticed. Katniss from Catching Fire is a traumatized person with everything she has experienced, who finds it difficult to get on with her normal life - which is made worse by the fact that she is forced to go on tour as government propaganda. Even so, the filmmakers were careful not to distort the protagonist: Katniss follows a strong, safe and courageous character, to the point of challenging the president himself. She is that honorable rebel with values that the cinema and the public so much like - no wonder, she is the great force and the main appeal of the entire series.The ""tour"" and the contrast of the situations experienced by the districts and the Capital are overwhelming for everyone. Gradually, even the alienated Effie (Elizabeth Banks) begins to understand how devastating the status quo of that world is - except for the elite who live in the Capital, far from the suffering of the majority, whose trials sustain their luxuries. The fighting only starts with almost an hour and a half of film already elapsed and the characters themselves recognize that worrying about romance in such a situation would be ridiculous - which adds yet another element of tragedy to the situation of young people, who should not carry such a heavy load on your shoulders. In fact, when we meet Katniss and Peeta, both are suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome and, through their condition, we come to understand more of Haymitch's suffering (Woody Harrelson). In fact, the very cynical tone with which director Francis Lawrence conducts the narrative is very reminiscent of the mentor's state of mind in the original feature.And anyone who thinks that the Quaternary Massacre is just a repetition of what had already been done is wrong, with the heroes fighting for their lives again. This, in fact, happens. However, the scales involved are bigger (the poisoned smoke, the monkeys and the idea that the arena is a clock that launched the dangers every hour is very good). For the first time, we have the feeling of a broader action unfolding, a real network of intrigues against official leaders. It is precisely at this point that Catching Fire proves to be superior to The Hunger Games. Violence is again present, but in a more subliminal way and inserted in a relevant context. If in the first film we had children and adolescents killing each other indiscriminately, without the necessary reflection for such acts to be perceived and discerned by their main audience - more or less the same age as the characters on the scene - this time there is a conspiracy full of ramifications, with effects and consequences. Everything is part of a plan, even if it is not revealed to the satisfaction. But the important thing is that there is, therefore, something to be told, which finally draws the viewer to the center of the plot. However, ""The Hunger Games - Catching Fire"" fails to splurge on the edition of the games that are part of the film, propagating that the game will be much more brutal because it has only the winners of the past editions, but what we see are very weak characters to have won a past edition of the game.Once again, the cast stands out and makes everything gain depth and credibility. The film wouldn't work if it weren't for the talent and charisma of Jennifer Lawrence, who has a unique responsibility here. It is the suffering of her Katniss that is put to the public at all times and it is her emotional scars that are exposed in ways that border on sadism, until her final resolution, in which a powerful look from the young actress strikes us in a direct way and the change that took place inside Katniss is palpable. The young actress has a rare ability to say a lot with a simple look and conveys, often without words, the internal conflict of a defiant young woman, who needs to be strong, but at the same time suffers from everything she has gone through and still doesn't really understand the grandeur of the setting in which it was inserted.Catching Fire works better the idea of the dystopian future, planting the seeds for the third part. It is nevertheless interesting to see serious themes being addressed in works of this nature - there is, in addition to the obvious plot about the relationship between the government and the people, a clear criticism of the invasion of privacy and the culture of veneration of celebrities so in vogue nowadays. What is seen, therefore, is not a sequence that is limited to walking in circles, but one that prefers to move forward, expanding the concept initially presented. Francis Lawrence deserves to be praised for the sobriety and seriousness with which he conducts the plot, not letting himself be shaken by the visual exaggerations of the capital, in what could have turned into a meaningless carnival show, worthy of the bread and circus show denounced by the franchise. The subtext of the universe created by Suzanne Collins is even more obvious in the film, but unfortunately it must still pass meters above the heads of a large part of the audience, who are there, ironically, just for the spectacle it represents. Despite dealing with abuse of power, rights and duties of the state, personal sacrifices, and the role of the citizen, comments like ""how cool it would be to live in Panem"" can be read, proof of the state of critical thinking skills of a fraction of this generation.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

The filmmakers have done everything they could.,"""We don't have to destroy her, just her image. Show them that she's one of us now. Let them rally behind that. They're gonna hate her so much they just might kill her for you."" Plutarch Heavensbee (Phillip Seymour Hoffman)The Hunger Games: Catching Fire as sequel doesn't as much generate heat as it does satisfaction, the sense that the filmmakers have done just about everything they could to keep our attention, draw our sympathy, and entertain us all the while staying close to its iconic source. Here's a young adult adventure that includes a sensible proletariat heroine, an insensitive ruling class, and romance that reflects the vagaries of humanity's quest for love.Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), on the eve of the 75th Hunger Games, is still torn between respect for her games partner, Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), and the hunky Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth). Director Francis Lawrence keeps the focus on the heroine, who, like the rest of us, is flawed, in her case a destructive disdain for corrupt authority figures, embodied in President Snow (Donald Sutherland). Lawrence and d.p. Jo Willems keep us seeing from her point of view, a smart strategy to humanize the inhuman proceedings of child killing child in ultimate survival gaming.Her answer to her difficulties with Capital authority is to tackle a general and marry Peeta, among other impulses. Yet even with this endangerment, the heroine remains a genuine human being, torn between survival and the nagging feeling that she is meant to save her species. That's a big gap, but the film makes it possible to bridge it in the imagination and reality.Beside the mature performance of Lawrence, who makes a teen torn in love both palatable for adults and almost reasonable, Donald Sutherland is powerful as President Snow, white-haired and bearded, a dark force with an ironic snow-white image. His almost tongue-in-cheek authority plays perfectly behind the devastatingly Nazi-like podium and storm-trooper menace to make the evil just a bit lighter than in real life totalitarianism is.In fact, the film is an unusually effective commentary on repressive regimes, currently too many to count on this planet, and the inevitability of the masses rising up. This second installment of The Hunger Game trilogy gets us closer to the rebellion with a heroine both formidable and vulnerable. That's just so much more human than marvelous superheroes who fly above the rest of us.""You fought very hard in the Games, Miss Everdeen. But they were games. Would you like to be in a real war?

Jennifer Lawrence portrays Katniss flawlessly and Josh Hutcherson did splendidly as Peeta. I have never seen actors like these capture the exact essence of their character so perfectly. The casting was so fitting! The animation and CGI is so realistic! They somehow managed to make these Hunger Games so terrifyingly real, especially when it comes to the arena and the fighting sequences. The dialogue is so natural, nothing too odd or forced about it.

Champion of champions.,"In a way, 'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013)' is the opposite of its predecessor: its first half is strong and its second half is weak. That's right, the game segment of this sequel is arguably its least effective. It falls into the trap of being far too glossy for its own good. While the clean cinematography and refined CGI undeniably impressive, they don't help the film convey the horror of its central situation. In fact, they almost do the opposite, transforming what was once a gritty and uncomfortable scenario into a slice of big-budget blockbuster entertainment. Of course, it isn't just the steady camerawork, effective use of the IMAX format, or reliance on computer graphics that dampens the sequence's effect. Instead, it's the story's reliance on fantastical traps, mostly adult heroes and bloodless combat that reduces the necessary grisliness of its theoretically gory game. Human-on-human combat is present but pushed so far into the background that it's almost irrelevant, and the final act isn't so much a fight for survival as it is an attempt to form a team and stick with it until the end. It doesn't help that our hero is actually a pawn in someone else's game for most of the movie, unbeknownst to her or us. Though this is thematically relevant and comes into play more in the sequels, it leads to an experience that feels as though it relies heavily on last-minute exposition to explain its various twists. It also makes the protagonist feel oddly passive, which is never really a good sign. However, having said all that, the feature is still generally entertaining. It's visually compelling, conceptually interesting and filled with strong performances. As I mentioned earlier, its first half is actually really strong. It immediately feels like an improvement on the non-game elements of the first film, as there's a solid sense of atmosphere from the opening scene. The emotional beats typically work well, actually having some weight behind them because they seem like consequences of prior actions, and the narrative itself is much more interesting than it was in the first hour of the original. There's a sense of political unrest, growing rebellion and underlying threat that wasn't present before, and it makes the affair that much more interesting. Ultimately, though the flick is flawed and doesn't have as strong a finale as I'd like, it's still an enjoyable affair with a few moments of genuine suspense.

For one thing it has Sam Claflin in it with his chest out, for another, it is the film that connects the first to the last (2), which I realise is an obvious statement, but I mean that in the same way that The Empire Strikes Back (1980) connects Star Wars (1977) and Return Of The Jedi (1983). It's important that the things in this film happen for the series to make sense, where some second films in a trilogy (Quadrilogy) don't always add any value or stand alone entirely.I know my nephews moan that Mockingjay Parts 1&2 are boring and I think that's because those films are very political and don't feature the action of the actual Hunger Games in the ring and I think that this film is great to still show the interesting element of the games with all the politics going on in the background too. In this way it bridges the gap from the first, which was mostly about just the games themselves and the final parts which are much more politic. A nice blend and a slow down as it gets a bit more real, teaching the young adult viewers (and readers) to fight for a worthy cause and not to put up with injustice (but that's the next two, I'm digressing as I always do).You're left with a cliffhanger and a who, what, why feeling as well as a thirst to find out what's next. I know what's coming, because I've seen them before, but I'm still looking forward to the concluding two parts of this four part trilogy, because this one has left me desirous of resolution. I want to know that these characters get to safety and resolve the issues that have arisen.
The direction, acting and production, along with a great story to start with, have made them of interest to me and just like the time when I spent the whole weekend watching Friends and convinced myself that they were all my real friends, I care about what happens to these characters.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

"Battle Royale 2: the ""Unofficial"" Remake","IN A WAY, i am ... annoyed when I see the preview... I'm sure most people are. Do the director not know that Battle Royale 2 is NOT a small but fairly a big recent movie that won awards. Its like remaking Titanic or something. But anyhow... I am glad that this film is made - so that I can see if Francis Lawrence dare to remake the movie the SECOND TIME. Oh yea.. and by the way - all the topic about Quentin Taratino... you just have to admit he does rip off other movies. Not that I don't like him.. but those of you KILL BILL fans, just gotta watch an ancient Japanese movie called LADY SNOWBLOOD (1973). Same shots, same set, same music... i think better story. It even has Cartoon describing one of the character's past. You can not argue that Kill Bill is a complete rip off of this movie even though the huge scale of the story is a bit different. well i don't feel like typing anymore.. good luck you all!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
The games continue.,"I had few problems with the first movie based on the trilogy of the books authored by Suzanne Collins. The build up was excellent. They really caught the nitty gritty of the reality shows in all its glory of their hypocrisy. And you could sense that there was something 'orwellian' about the whole setting-the bleakness, the play of power and the dearth of freedom. But then the second half happened and all the tension, all that build up was lost to a very timid climax. And all this for what? So that it could earn more bucks by decreasing the viewers' restrictions. I have never understood the criteria by which they rate the movie for the different ages of the audience. No matter how much you tone down the violence the movie, the content of the story, that is brimming with darkness, still works on the mind painting a vivid picture of gore and violence. So if physical display of violence you ban, how would you justify the mental picture of violence that draws itself as soon as the story starts? The rating system is nuts and stupid. Now coming to the movie that I am supposed to be writing about. The second part in the four installments series does everything that its predecessor does, and improves on it. It expands on its 'orwellian settings' giving a detailed bleakness to the state of the affairs and those little flowers of hope that have sprung in that tyrannical state, all thanks to earlier exploits of Jennifer Lawrence's character. The screenplay is coherent and swift and interesting despite the fact that movie is about two and a half hours long. There are few jarring notes here and there in few suspected character developments and unrealistic motives. But that could be forgiven. The ending is abrupt and that is bit of a problem. The greatest accomplishment of the movie is to sway you into that anger, helplessness and hope of the people as it simmers to the boiling point of a rebellion. And yet it makes you question the thin line between the martyrdom and cold blooded murder for the cause. Like every good dystopian world movie, you would be able to identify the roots of the present in that future. I think it did a pretty okay character study with most of the characters. Katniss is torn between safety of her family and the depressing state of the people, between her love for Gale and affection for Peeta and between the demons of the past and the present. Peeta is a disappointment. He seems to be a sort of breed between a puppy and a sitting duck. And that is a pity when so much depth could have been added to him. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is one of sequels that improves upon its predecessors in every way, but still falls short of greatness. No doubt it is braver than its predecessor, but I wish it could have been bolder.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

Impressive Sequel,"I think this movie offers it all. That may seem strange as I have only rated a 7 but in truth I'm not sure what I would've wanted, it might just be the fact that this movie is just another part of the story that it can't deliver everything. In my opinion it is much better than the first movie as my only real complaint from that one was that the hunger games action didn't really start until the last hour. Although this film had a similar set up, I found the build up to the return to the games was much more interesting and set up a brilliant and thrilling game.

"""Our lives aren't just measured in years. They're measured in the lives of people we touch around us.""","Interestingly, before this rewatch I actually considered this to be one of my least favourite Hunger Games films. Don't get me wrong, in my eyes, each of these installments are 10/10 to me, but my issue with The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013) was that the part where they visit each district did drag for me a fair bit. But that was my only problem with it. And actually, upon this viewing, it didn't drag at all for me, so I've no longer got a problem with that, hence why I now consider this to be a complete masterpiece. What makes this stand out amongst the other Hunger Games movies is the twist, which is cleverly done. You know throughout Act 2 and 3 that something is up, but you just can't quite tell what exactly. And wow, you would never be able to predict the twist, especially a twist of that magnitude. And whenever you rewatch it, it's always interesting to see how it was expertly foreshadowed.And finally, this is the installment where our two protagonists' relationship really blossoms. I truly love the chemistry between the two of them, and it adds a bit of an emotional spark to this franchise which I think might be one of the main reasons why I cherish The Hunger Games so much.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

Worst than the first,First of all I have to start by saying I thought the first movie was a total rip off from a Japanese movie called Battle Royale. Same plot about some kids who are chosen to kill each other. The only difference between the two is that Hunger Games is a total Hollywood funded movie and Battle Royale is not. I didn't see ANYTHING different in the 2nd film than the first. I feel bad because my wife had paid for our movie tickets and I did not enjoy the movie at all. I don't see what the big hype and excitement is over these films. I also only read books about actual facts instead of fantasy so reading the books would serve no purpose. If you thought the first movie was mediocre then don't waste your money seeing the 2nd. With the cost of going to the movie theater your better off staying at home and maybe renting or downloading this when it comes out. I'm giving it a 1/10 and would give it a zero but the bar won't go that low.,1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

In addition, the desperation of the people in the film at the very front was the plan. They were so desperate that every event has a really unhinge and has reduced the credibility of the film.

"Much Faster, More Visceral, and More Intriguing","The First Hunger Games film did something special. It told a compelling Dystopian type story. This film took the best elements from the first film and REALLY expanded upon them.The first film introduced the idea of the games to us, but this film gave us the argument and philosophy of why the games existed in the first place. This film also did a great job with expanding the world of Panem and it's character storytelling.As far as character moments go, there were alot of great moments from both Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson. Both of them struggling with life after the Games, and how they deal with the
savagery they've witnessed while going through another round of even more savagery in this film. Both are at there peak in this film and continue to shine and grow.Shoutout to Donald Sutherland though. We definitly get to spend more time with him in this film and we really get to see more of what drives him to do what he does, and we get to see some really awesome moments between his character President Snow, and Katniss Everdeen.The imagery and cinematography I believe have really stepped up since the last movie. There were some really beautiful shots. And the music is even more of a standout in this one.Other than that, like I said before, the action is a lot more savage than previous, and definitely more faster paced in my opinion. The Choreography and the action scenes were done really well.I know people say that this film may be the best film in The Hunger Games franchise, but in my opinion, both the 1st and 2nd could be potentially tied for first in my mind.

An exciting 2.5 hours,"The fact that the Hunger Games stories are not crushed by their own weight is mystifying, and an achievement. It seems crazy that a film whose ideology is as savagely brutal as the fictional Games would become such a hit. Despite all its violent connotations and tyrannical regimes, the film comes off as the year's pinnacle of entertainment. Maybe the allure lies in ourselves? We project ourselves on screen. We are Katniss fighting back against the oppressors. The film's core audience is essentially the same demographic that would be sacrificed if such games were ever to become a reality, so maybe everyone is really just preparing for the future? When the Games start, we'll know what to expect.According to IMDb, Post-apocalyptic thrillers are not particularly big money makers; The Hunger Games franchise being the only series that nearly approaches real commercial heavy weights. The first two Hunger Games installments together hold the top grossing spots in the genre, but even then, they don't come near grossing anything like the top 50 overall films. Avatar and Titanic are the top two. Both have over two billion worldwide gross. Still, Hunger Games has a hard-core devoted fan base that rivals even Twilight.At the Los Angeles premiere of The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, young fans camped out for three days just to be front and center on the red carpet, catching glimpses of the film's stars.The best scenes of the film visually were the ones shot in the districts. The New Yorker review describes these scenes like ""Eastern-bloc depressiondrained of vitality,"" but Katniss is exactly the opposite. As a hero she is so strong that alleviates the vitality drainage. Once we leave the districts, the filmmakers deflect the intensity of the subject matter using Katniss as a distraction. Katniss keeps the film from being engulfed into an R-rated abyss. I love R-rated abysses, but they don't draw fans like Jennifer Lawrence's strong performances in these PG-13 flicks.There were some weaknesses. The coincidence that Katniss and Peeta would be drawn back into the turmoil was too much, an obvious excuse just to get Katniss back in the ring. How is that we didn't hear of these conflicts in the past film? Surely Katniss and Peeta would have the known the traditions of the world they live in.Also, why are all the people in the capital dressed so outlandishly? How do they assemble for all public events in perfect symmetry? Why is the President's only concern with the games? Doesn't he have other duties?What the story lacks in depth, and it certainly does lack, it makes up for in action-packed, well- shot scenes. Despite an appearance by Phillip Seymour Hoffman as the game maker, the curves thrown at the participants in this rendition of the Games weren't as exciting as the first film.The most annoying thing in the film was Peeta Malark. He is a weakling and not an interesting character. On the battlefield he hardly contributes. He seems to function only as a male counterpart to Katniss in the political spectrum as Katniss ends up fighting battles for two in the forest.Overall The Hunger Games: Catching Fire was worth the price of admission, and at 2 hours 26 minutes, it flies by quick.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

"not nearly enough fire, sorry","You'd expect a merry-go-round in the sky, almost, the way people are on about Katniss Everdeen. I won the full set in a competition where mine was the winning review, thank you Raru South Africa, I do appreciate, I never would have seen it otherwise, the original box cover artwork of THE HUNGER GAMES reminded me too much of images I have seen of computer- animated Lara Croft and I didn't have this on my list of DVDs to obtain, but when my BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER review took first prize, I was real chuffed for the nifty boxset.Once again though, there's nothing really, really special in here. Come on, people, it's an average performance in a movie coming in well below what it should have been. I hasten to add, in all fairness, that those computer-generated mandrills... Ooh jeepers they made excellent excellent adversaries, the only real high point of the movie. Had the entire flick been that kind of edge-of-your-seat stuff...But Jennifer Lawrence is nothing extra-special in this movie. Do not get me wrong, I am not dissing her, no.

Yeah, where are the days of the great poster artwork, like THE GAUNTLET, and the Roger Moore James Bond movies?In closing, I repeat, I do not mean it is a weak movie/weak performance.

This is actually much better than the first movie, in my opinion. The PG-13 rating is very appropriate for it, and anyone under the age of maybe eleven or twelve should not see it, as the movie is highly intense and what the characters experience and endure is teenager and above material (same goes for the first movie and the books).

"Fixes a lot of faults, but still lacking in proper bite.","This sequel makes up for a lot of its predecessor's glaring faults, yet somehow continues to paint its theme in the same unbelievable and contrived fashion. Having survived the Hunger Games, a gladiatorial arena fashioned by a tyrannical society called The Capitol, heroes Katniss and Peeta must deal with their limelight fame from those they despise, and the relationship they pretended to have to escape death. The Capitol's president however doesn't approve how every survivor can give the repressed people hope, and creates a new Hunger Games where only seasoned survivors compete to the death.I didn't like 2012's Hunger Games. I went into this sequel with trepidation, but I have to admit the first hour or so got me very interested! We have the Capitol actually flexing its muscles and giving our heroes and lower classes a hard time, they are actually competent villains for once. There are real consequences to the aftermath of the first Games, troopers raid towns, people are executed, even our heroine is shaken and brittle from the experience! The idea of Katniss and Peeta being thrown into a last- man-standing death match (for real this time) with seasoned veterans who hate them, all commanded by newcomer (and slimier than ever) Phillip Seymour Hoffman. I was pretty excited!But then the Hunger Games event began and everything fell apart. Our combatants are unique, but about two thirds of them die off screen, and the real problem of fighting to the last man is dropped immediately. The Capitol again have no teeth, no guts and their Hunger Games as a concept continues to be completely redundant. I'm sorry, but I still don't understand. The Capitol are still incompetent villains at the end of the day, and it infuriates me! I like the idea that they are weak due to their overconfidence and complacency, but it has never been shown that the Hunger Games even works as a deterrent, it only seems to be a massive invitation for uprising and war. It makes no sense!There's also a twist at the end, I cannot say what it is, but it only compounds this complete inability by The Capitol, and actually undermines most of the threat that you initially felt earlier. I cannot comprehend watching this again it would be even less convincing.(it also still irritates me that most of the actual killing in the Hunger Games happens off screen, although it is true this film has a little more brutality)This film does have a very good beginning, I like The Capitol's citizens, I like the heavy subtext of television control and celebrity worship that dominates the first hour. Jennifer Lawrence is still great as Katniss, the action is actually directed better here (less shaky- cam and rapid cuts) and for two hours and thirty, it didn't feel long. But god does it still wound me with its lackluster execution and its unbelievably not-threatening tyrants, and it all fell apart at the end.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Now this is how you do a sequel.,"Now this is how to do a sequel. It is better than the previous part in every way. Better story, better pacing, better acting, better action and way better Hunger games itself. I was very underwhelmed by the game in the first one, it actually bored me somewhat. The game in this one on the other hand was intense and enjoyable.Story picks up from where it left off from the previous part. I loved the whole revolution vibe and its starting. There were more politics this time around and made the movie more interesting. Side characters in the movie were better, lots of new ones. Elizabeth Banks this time had a little more role and I really liked her, great acting by her in all that weird dressup. I still can't get behind the fact that rich high society folks in this series wear such GAY and weird and lame clothes.CGI was decent, an improvement from the previous part. The whole Hunger game, about 40-45 mins of it was shot in IMAX and it was beautiful to look at in HD quality. Gotta say, IMAX scenes always stand out in HD print. Same was the case with The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises and TRON Legacy. Action scenes were enjoyably and tense sometimes.

Solid step up from the first film even though it still lacks real teeth,"When I watched the first Hunger Games film I was surprised by how safe, sanitized and almost totally unmemorable it was – things that were even more surprising to me when you consider the subject matter of children murdering children. To me that was a failing of the film but also of the first part of the story since we really did need more horror and oppression to it all. As a result I really wasn't too bothered about seeing the next film but eventually I did simply because I had time to kill.Fortunately the second film steps things up pretty well because in the first hour I felt it did a much better job showing the impact of the killing and the violent oppression of the state than it did the first time. This is important because it did draw me into the situation rather than letting me sit passively. When the games section comes it does keep it relatively tight in the training section so it doesn't feel too retread. The games themselves focus less on the 1v1 aspect and more on the build to something else; this is fine for me since the film still lacks the nerve to be horrific in this way but here does at least provide some good action as it goes. The production values have also been increased and the laughable effects of the first film have been replaced by ones much more becoming of a film that wants to be a large blockbuster franchise.The entertainment value of the film is higher as a result but I did enjoy that it had found more of a consistent dark edge, even if it did still lack real bite in some ways. The performances were mostly strong too. With Lawrence in particular being very good at making the most of whatever she is given – which at times is not a huge amount it must be said. Hutcherson is the polar opposite of this and I have no idea how someone so bland managed to get such a role as this. Support is good from Harrelson, Sutherland, Banks, Tucci, Hoffman, Wright and others, giving the film a good spread of class even if they do not really get much time to do much.It is still flawed but at least this film seemed like it knew what it wanted to do and it found a darker edge it felt comfortable with even if it never really pushes the audience out of that nice marketable comfort zone that it has. I'm not only hoping the next film can continue this improvement but I'm looking forward to finding out.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Satisfactory Sequel - a bridge from Hunger Games to Mocking Jay,"I truly think that the original, The Hunger Games, as a film, irrespective of what one thinks of its fidelity to the book, is a modern classic. I thought it realized its dystopic future world beautifully and tragically with impeccable and well-conceived costume design, set design, acting, and script. It was fully contained within itself even though they knew when filming it that it was the first book of a trilogy and were already planning to do a sequel. I consider the first one to be at a minimum, a top 500 all-time movie.I just saw Catching Fire. I enjoyed it for what it was - about a 7 on a scale of 10. It is NOT a stand-alone movie but a good installment of a superior serial. It rather mirrors the 2nd episode of other sci- fi/fantasy trilogies such as the original Star Wars (now 4,, 5, and 6) - very much in the dark vein of The Empire Strikes Back. Also comparable to the middle Rings movie and to a lesser extent, Back to the Future II.The acting in Catching Fire is still terrific. The new parts of the set design all underscore the darkness of President Snow's reactionary reaction to what happened in the first movie. Not that much new in costume design, but still fine. But it seems much more repetitive and the Games themselves much less suspenseful than the original tableau. Like most serials, the first 20% is spent bringing the viewers who missed or forgot what happened the first time back up to date.In short, if you were expecting Catching Fire to be another modern classic in the league of The Hunger Games, you'll be disappointed. If you are expecting installment II of a serial - a bridge to take you from Hunger Games to Mocking Jay, than you have a perfectly fine version of that.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Good - but not really good enough,"I was positively surprised by the books. Didn't think I would like them but ended up liking them a lot. My biggest concern before reading the books was that a lot of violence – and violence between kids – would be made into entertainment without the moral, ethic and realistic aspect of such violence. The books does address these questions in a very good way in a way the movie(s) doesn't – probably since the movie(s) has been made for a younger audience (?). (However it would surely be possible to make a movie that does address these important questions without necessarily making it more gore.)So, I could have just written that my main concern with the movie is this – it takes some very serious and violent scenes and makes it into the viewers' pleasure and entertainment, without taking any stand against the moral, ethic and realistic aspect of such violence. (So I'm taking the books into defense here but I have to criticize the movie for it.) It tells a very dramatic and violent story without the morale questions and simply turns it into a series of entertaining events to watch.If we put the morale question aside it ends up being a rather OK movie. We have a bunch of really talented and ambitious actors who really put their effort into the movie – with good results. Lawrence, Hutcherson, Harrelson really ARE their characters and are giving a true and believable faces to Katniss, Peeta and Haymitch. Donald Sutherland is without any hesitation President Snow. Banks gives Effie so much life and colour she should without any doubt get 1,2,3 awards for best supporting role.The movie is filmed and put together a lot better than the first movie, without those long, annoying and not really saying anything- flashbacks. Even unbelievable scenes are made believable and true. The colours, environment and cut are all thought through, sometimes even breath-taking. It all comes together so very well, if it just wasn't for the fact that when you remove the important questions from a book you end up with a good, but not good enough movie. It just doesn't touch you, it doesn't mean anything and it doesn't stay with you. You watch it, and when the movie ends, it just leaves you and after a few days it just fades away, leaving nothing.I would recommend this movie, it is good, it keeps you without doubt occupied and gladly watching it. But it really saddens me that such a good book isn't given a better result as a movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Just gets better!,"I loved this movie. Just as much, or more than than the first. I enjoyed the plot for this movie/book, because they are starting to take action against the Capital. I loved actually seeing the new arena. It is awesome to actually see what I pictured in the book. It looked way better than I every imagines it could. It looked great! The new casting was good. I was looking forward to some new characters and the actors played them well. I knew everything about the movie from the book, yet I was kept interested the whole time. The only real negative thing I would have to say about it, would be that the movie was very fast-paced. I get why they have to that, because so much detail happened in the book and they don't want the movie to be too long. But everything seemed to go by in the blink of eye. However, it stayed true to the novel. I can't wait for Mocking Jay Part 1 and Part 2! :)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Improves Upon Everything That Needed Improving,"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire improves upon almost every one of the (already few) imperfections of the first stellar movie. Most notably, the intensely dramatic and emotional scenes are better emphasized this time around. Jennifer Lawrence's portrayal of Katniss is better than ever, though her sister and mother are still lackluster. Hutcherson's performance has improved greatly compared to his first turn. The rest of the A-list cast (Harrelson, Banks, Kravits, Sutherland, Tucci, and newcomer Hoffman) continue to give all-star portrayals. This movie is all around bigger and better than its predecessor. The scope feels larger and the grand scheme of the story is beginning to develop. This movie is darker and more morbid due simply to its story content, and I absolutely love that about it. Again, it was the best possible film adaptation of the book. The main drawback is the somewhat rushed middle section (and some points towards the end). At just under 2.5 hours, I still think they could've added ~15 minutes to expand upon the movie's ideas, themes, and character introductions that happened around that time without turning people away for thinking it's too long. Overall, Catching Fire is one of the few blockbuster sequels that is able to truly outshine the incredible original, and it sets the bar high for two even more hotly anticipated sequels with great promise in their future. 8.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Bleak, dull and disappointing sequel.","I have to start out by saying that I have never read the Hunger Games books and therefor am taking the movies for what they are. That being said, I enjoyed the first film, it was no classic but, it was entertaining and Jennifer Lawrence gave a strong performance as usual. But, sadly the second film based on this trilogy of popular books is a moody and bleak disappointment. Catching Fire picks up with Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) about to embark on their victory tour to be paraded like show ponies through the districts. But, Katniss' act of defiance that provoked the unprecedented two winners in the 74th Hunger Games has sown the seeds of dissent throughout the 12 districts and is seen by The Capitol as a symbol of rebellion. President Snow (Donald Sutherland) himself visits Katniss to warn her to play nice on the tour or her family and friends will suffer the consequences. Meanwhile Katniss is suffering from the horrible guilt of having to kill and watch others she bonded with die and no matter where she goes, she finds herself being looked up to as a symbol of hope against the totalitarian government and her own contempt for The Capitol grows each day. Snow's new game-maker Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) proposes a solution to their woes... to make the 75th Hunger Game a battle between selected former winners of the games from each district and to make sure Miss Everdeen is not amongst the winners this time. Now, as the wind of rebellion is starting across the districts, Katniss and Peeta must fight once more and this time against proved killers. Will the shell shocked Katniss survive once again or will the country's hope for freedom be crushed with the death of their symbol of defiance. Catching Fire is this time directed by Francis Lawrence who gave us the moody and bleak fantasy flicks Constantine and I Am Legend and brings that same dark and grim atmosphere to this middle chapter of the book based trilogy and to be honest little else. Fire is a rather dull and by the numbers sequel with a very sedate and bleak look to go along with it's oppressive atmosphere. I realize this is a story of a land governed by a cruel and iron fisted government who are planning to basically execute the peoples' first glimmer of hope so, I didn't expect rainbows and unicorns but, when a movie like this' best scene involves a dress, then you know there's not much going for it. Even with Katniss being inserted into another combat, the 75th Hunger Game provides very little action and literally no suspense as it focuses on Katniss and group of allies commiserating in the jungle arena with very little threat save some poison gas and some foul tempered primates. Their actual foes rarely put in an appearance, save when their pictures are displayed above in the sky to signal their demise... most of which prompted this reviewer to ask ""who the hell was that?"" And that's also a problem, we only get to know the participants that are crucial to the plot and the rest are just fodder to try to give the game some urgency and body count... and it doesn't really work because, we never really care about these people and some we have never even met. To be honest save for a few moments, such as the before mentioned dress scene, I was pretty bored with what was going on. Katniss never seems to be in control like in the first film and spends most of the film pouting or having combat flashbacks and we never get endeared to or behind her like in the first flick. Here she seems to stew in her unhappiness and let others around her do all the work till literally the last few moments of the film. And it's not until the very last scene do we finally see the fire back in the eyes of the girl on fire... then we are left with an open ending leading into the third flick. Sorry, but for someone who hasn't read the books, this was completely unsatisfying. The cast all perform their roles just fine with Harrelson once again standing out and giving a strong turn as Abernathy... he has become one of the best actors out there... Sutherland is appropriately slimy and singer Lenny Kravitz also impresses as Cinna. As for leading lady Lawrence, she is good and gives the part a lot of emotional depth but, since most of those emotions require her to pout, cry or have a screaming out-burst, it's just hard to warm up to Katniss this time. And as for her co-star, like in the first flick , Hutcherson recites his lines with does eyes making his every scene appear like he's posing for a velvet painting. And does Katniss really love him or the hunky Gale (Liam Hemsworth, Thor's brother) because, I am confused at this point and not sure I care. So, in conclusion, this second Hunger Games failed to get my interest or emotional involvement in the story because, it was just too dark and bleak and gave us a lead character who, instead of being a symbol of hope, looked like she was ready to climb under a blanket on the couch and pout with a gallon of ice cream and a bottle of scotch. And after watching this moody second installment you might want to too! At least the sets and FX were top notch and Harrelson and a few others elevated their performances above the dark cloud that hovers over this flick. Very disappointing.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Another Worldwide Phenomenon,"First of all, I want to say that I'm a huge fan of the Hunger Games and this is my first film review. I decided to write to write this review because I was to excited. I've just seen this film 4 hours ago. I spent 146 minutes sitting in the cinema watching it without blinking my eyes. I have to admit that this is the best film I've seen so far in my life. The unpredictable scenes hit me like a thunder. You know what, chill hit my spine several times. I really enjoy this film. I really appreciate Jennifer's acting, she completely is a genius actress. I love everything about this film. Jennifer didn't disappoint me, thank you Jennifer, I love you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Okay movie, but entertaining","Being one of those people who don't read the books but watch the movies, to me it was an okay movie. Even though this is my 3rd time watching it, I thought I might as well do a review on it. This one was much better then the first one. It had better special affects, to me seemed more entertaining, also they did much better with the camera work ( in the first movie in some scenes the camera work was a little shaky) the basic for all the hunger games is people killing each other. Some other directors could have gone all out with the blood and gore, but this director Francis Lawrence did an excellent job if directing. He never made it to gory but gory enough that it was still intriguing. By the end of the movie they made a lot of improvements that they did wrong in the first movie, so I am happy with that.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Definitely and improvement,"Definitely and improvement upon the first movie: we have a lot more beautiful wide shots with very decent VFX while the first one used to many close-up shots and had clearly cheaper effects to save on budget. While still lacking in depth compared to the book the story feels less compressed but the focus is on the main core characters and some side characters get neglected or eliminated. While I was reading the book I thought that some scenes might come of as very cliché in the film and they do, while in the book you get the characters thoughts which makes it all seems less shallow. Altogether I liked it but I just failed to connect with it: it does seems like a good screen translation of the book but still it feels like it's just not epic, not a classic. I never had a 'wow' moment or never felt blown away. I don't completely get the success of the series as there is nothing really special about it...",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Best Bockbuster of the Year,"""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" picks up exactly where the last film left off, continuing the sparks of rebellion. This film takes everything that was great about the first film and makes it significantly better. The characters are more defined, the special effects are better, the score is more bombastic, writing is stronger, and the overall feel is grander. The themes of hope that lurks in the series are exemplified even further as the stakes are higher and the amount of freedom is slowly withering away.Directing is really the main highlight of this film. The new director, Francis Lawrence, keeps the overall feel of the series, but brings greater control and precise attention to detail to the on screen action and drama. The action is easier to see and choreographed really well. Interesting shots are used to cover up the grotesque level of violence, but they are no less impactful than actually seeing it. The use of a much steadier camera really makes taking in everything easier. The level of emotion is effectively presented on screen and the use of music excels everything to a more heart touching level. Even though the film is more emotional, it still manages to have some moments of humor spread throughout. The script is tight and really develops these characters that we've grown to love. While the social commentary on reality television is on the lacking side, the themes of hope, freedom, trust, and unity are far more assessed.While many of the older characters return, there are many new ones introduced. First things first, Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen is still one of my favorite characters of all time and I love her here as much as I did before. However, she doesn't grow as a character as much this time around. She's more struggling with her inner demons as she tries to find herself at the helms of this new revolution that is around the corner. Peeta on the other hand, grows a lot. He's more confident and less dependent on Katniss. He can hold his own and even takes the initiative a few times. Effie even goes through some character growth as we see her love for her tributes. Woody Harrelson as Haymitch is still the wise cracking drunk, but has become more generous and caring. While our returning characters are great, the newer additions are just as awesome. The two standouts for me are Finnick and Johanna. Finnick is not only a great looking guy, but has a heart of gold. He seems vain with ulterior motives, but he proves himself to be caring and protective. Johanna is a total bad girl. She's really in your face, a bit psychotic, and a powerful warrior. However, she can even manage to be funny. All the characters are great including the additions of the new ones. They all get good screen time and development and we can really care for them, unlike the first film where the side characters took a seat to the more interesting Katniss.Overall ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" is a great follow up to ""The Hunger Games."" Everything is better from directing to writing to the use of music. It really expands on the universe and sets itself up for the next two films. The stakes are higher and there are a lot more to care about. I give it 4.5/5, a great sequel that builds up on the original to deliver a really great cinematic experience.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Visually amazing, and follows book well, but feels like the first one.","One of the things that first leaped out to me about this movie is it's stunning visuals. The beautiful shots of capitol and the game landscape are amazing. Capitol is sort of like a mix between Las Vegas and Los Angeles with many bright lights with loads of celebrity like influence. Catching Fire also gives you a good connection to the characters. During one moment in the movie, I was rubbing my neck and cringing at how painful certain parts felt.One problem with Catching Fire as a book though is that it feels too similar to the first book. Catching Fire seems in many ways like the first movie shot in different ways with slight plot changes and this makes you feel like the author used this book to milk the franchise rather than actually have more substance. While this is reviewing the book rather than the movie, I feel this is important because one good thing about the movie is how well it does follow the book. Those are however, the original creator's faults and the director has no control over that.As a book this particular story has issues, but in my mind the director and screen writer did their best with this movie and it turned out great.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Surprised!,"After watching the first Hunger Games and being very disappointed I was reluctant to watch this one. However, credit where credit is due, they did a superb job reenacting Suzanne's Second book of the series.Jennifer Lawrence plays Katniss with such determination, yet still managed to portray how vulnerable and elegant this woman is.All of the actors did a fine job in this film. I actually followed this better than the book, I finally realise that everyone is trying to keep her alive. I thought it was just normal book cliché, the heroine must live, but it is much deeper than that. The film gives an excellent portrayal of the story.It is gripping and dripping with suspense throughout. And even though it is a longer film it did not drag.The only criticism I have is the ending was very abrupt. I did expect more of a finale so to speak, I had many questions that I wanted answered, but I guess it is to keep you in suspense for the next film.Overall, I gave this film an 8 and would definitely recommend it.

Hunger Games - Either hate it or love it,"For what I've been hearing on the Hunger Games story you either going to love all the movies or you going to hate them. Yet I feel like I'm part of some middle class who doesn't go by any of the previous choices. The first of Hunger Games movie didn't dazzled me. I felt like it made no sense. The society they we're showing just did made sense for me. I get the poor class and the abuse of power and using the poor to fulfill the richest wants but the connection between a super advanced society with great technology supporting killing games just for fun caused me a certain ""itch"" that made me not to buy it. Now, with Hunger Games - Catching Fire and the revolution ahead it started making better sense. At least now people don't seem all to be puppets of the master show and I bought it. If you liked the first movie you are going to love this one because it's more intense (Kudos on Jennifer Lawrence, in my opinion she's becoming one of the finest artists of our generation) and we are finally presented with the going against the all uncomfortable situation of games made to kill people. Yet, it still bother's me a bit. I realize that it happened in our history several situation like this and nowadays we are still puppets in the hands of powerful people. Yet I like to believe that isn't in such exaggerated ways and we have more power to ""fight"" against it. On the other hand if you hated the first one probably isn't going to be this one making you change your mind. The story line hasn't change and Hunger Games it's still Hunger Games. Personally I fell like the characters behaviors and feelings are more better exploit and that brings them close to us. The movie still manages to pull some surprises (not extremely surprising but reasonable) and it ends up being a good way of entertaining in the drama/adventurous area. I certainly recommend it, a movie can always teach something. Worst case scenario is for you not to see the next one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

Not to mention, of course, that Jennifer Lawrence is a top notch talent. The only complaint I might have is leaving the audience suspended, having to wait for the other sequels to come out which is not exactly around the corner. Of course, in order to extend the franchise, they also chopped the final installment into two parts knowing that this was their last chance to keep their audience. I would recommend buying the DVD.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Slightly darker, far more thrilling mid-section of the trilogy","As a general rule (The Godfather II, The Empire Strikes Back and one or two others), sequels don't match the high expectations set by the original films. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is another rare film that bucks the trend.I'm not saying it's a perfect film or one that will survive time to be hailed in the same breath as the afore mentioned sequels but, having read Suzanne Collins' trilogy, this second outing in the franchise is both more satisfying than the thoroughly enjoyable first film and stamps all over the source novel. Whether you're a reader or viewer, if The Hunger Games excited you, you're going to love the sequel!Set a year after Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) won the 74th Hunger Games, the reluctant couple find themselves on the Victors' Tour, visiting each of the districts and witnessing ever more desperate examples of oppression and abuse at the hands of President Snow (Donald Sutherland). Dissatisfied with their half-hearted effort to maintain the front as a loving couple, Snow recruits Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) to devise a way to be rid of Katniss without causing a revolution: The Quarter Quell. Consequently, Katniss and Peeta find themselves back in the arena fighting for their lives, but this time their opponents are other former victors and the battle will be particularly vicious.As much as it is possible (and acceptable) to enjoy violence, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a very exciting and pleasing experience. Clocking in at well over two hours, it rattles along entertainingly and feels shorter and with far fewer glitches and flaws than its predecessor. There are a few, infrequent examples of clumsiness that could and really should have been avoided (a man executed in one scene is, moments later, carried away with nary a speck of blood on, or issuing from, him) and, naturally, there are elements of the book that have been condensed to fit the running time but despite those issues it remains a thoroughly entertaining film.The introduction of Claudius Templesmith (Toby Jones) is a short-lived delight. He is just one victim in a long list of underused characters performed beautifully by accomplished actors (Elizabeth Banks, Lenny Kravitz, Stanley Tucci) but most audiences wouldn't sit through a four-hour epic and so there must be casualties. Woody Harrelson is allowed to evolve his Haymitch so that he adds more gravitas than light relief and the relationship with Haymitch and Katniss crackles frostily, remaining a highlight of the series.The 'love' triangle between Katniss, Peeta and Gale (Liam Hemsworth) makes its way adequately into The Hunger Games: Catching Fire but, more than anything, sets up the third (and fourth for, alas, revenue dictates yet again that the final installment must be milked fully) installment. For Lawrence, this feels easy work. She knows her character and inhabits her with sufficient scorn and resentment to make us root for her without being so standoffish as to leave us questioning our feelings for her. The first of two autumnal cinema releases for Lawrence (next up is American Hustle), it is certain to further amplify the spotlight on Lawrence, a genuine movie star who is also a very fine actor.Come awards season, Lawrence may be a lucky winner of multiple gold for American Hustle, but as far as the masses are concerned, it will be The Hunger Games: Catching Fire that convinces them that she can open a film. A bona fide star in a dark and hugely entertaining romp. It may be a year away but I'm looking forward to parts three and four. What a pity the same cannot be said of The Hobbit.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
A very ambitious movie & quite enjoyable,"They tried to fit in a lot in this movie. As such, the main issue with Hunger Games: Catching Fire is its length. Your mileage may vary but it does feel long at times.Not that it's boring at all: what it does it does quite well : set up the rebellion, introduce us to new key characters and another round of fighting!Without spoiling: though this second edition of the Games is less exciting than the first one (mostly because we've been through this recently), it is a key episode and kicks off the 'true' hunger games story very aptly.One can understand why they decided to split the third tome into two movies when watching the second movie: it does a lot but it is still quite successful.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
excellent,"Hey, I walked with a really bad felling to the cinema thought it might be not so close to the book cause the first part wasn't close to the book too.

I don't know what's wrong with the ending, well it could have ended with a landing in district 13 and a view over an epic landscape with destroyed houses and so on. But instead they chose to show Katniss face and how it turns into anger, it shows that she now want to handle and enjoys the uprising. There's just one thing I need to complain and that's Jennifer Lawrence, well not at all but the scene she was the only person on screen weren't good. In the arena she jumped into the pond to get healed from the poison, it was a little bit too hysterical.

A matter of oppressive style,"I'm into and follow these films, not necessarily for what they are as cinema, but as an arena where youthful imagination is being shaped.I wrote extensively on the first, most things also pertain here. The main thing to note, from which everything else flows, is that this is once more the 'sponsored' version by Hollywood adults. I celebrate Spring Breakers as one of the most important films we've had recently, because it presents a youthful life of excess now, not after the fact, and goes on to find conflicting urges, not all of them destructive and empty, some of them transcendent, underscored by a beautiful curiosity to open up.Here a film event that used every channel of that whole instagram/MTV visual culture to reach out to an audience, and is made to cater to it by grooming young stars for talk shows and celebrity interviews, turns around and simply says that is all a grating lie foisted on us to hide the real world. This is not altogether false, Spring Breakers similarly shows a reckless partying. But it's a shallow irony masqueraded as intelligent commentary.Second, they try to remind the young audience that out there in the world persist hunger, poverty and oppression, and that we should be wary and charged to actually do something about it. But it posits that suffering as unlike something that could be now understood around us in a subtle way, as actual slavery and the most obvious oppression; indeed everything around this part, including Mockingjay's family as safe haven, has the visual air of something from the 1800s.The same fault binds these things. I do not suppose it is by deliberate construction, that would prop up in theory the same cruel autocracy. It is merely a matter of poor imagination by the 'Gamemakers', one of lecturing than allowing us room to embody. You'll see this again in the actual Games, the concept is a bit more intricate than last time but still relies on the same unimaginative hijinks: a killing fog, killing baboons, lightning on a tree.What about a film like this that creates a more tangible future instead of that juvenile dystopia, and tries to find our modern suffering in it? What about showing the young stars at least in part genuinely swept in the lifestyle? And what about her drawn to love the one she's with, being unsure if it's love?We could still have more or less the same insights about the world, but now really begin to examine self.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
better than the first one,"""Eyes bright, chins up, smiles on. I'm talking to you Katniss."" Still sulky, still independent, still a pain in the ass - it's so fun to watch Katniss Everdeen (played by the ever so charming Jennifer Lawrence) annoy the hell out of President Snow and his Stormtroopers - er, Peace Keepers, once again.. and kick some baboon's ass.Francis Lawrence sitting in the director's chair seems to be a good choice (but it would have been interesting if David Cronenberg or Alfonso Cuaron, who were also considered, have been chosen). But I'm happy with Lawrence's work. Catching Fire is a huge improvement over Gary Ross' The Hunger Games. The returning cast did a way better job than what they did in the first movie. Screenplay was essentially faithful to the book. Of course changes were made, but that's necessary. I have no complaints regarding that.It's not a perfect film nor is it a perfect fantasy/sci-fi story - but considering its source material, they can only do so much, and they did more than enough, more than I've expected.

Hungry for more,"As I only watched the original ""Hunger Games"" as part of a child-minding mission for my now 12 year-old niece, it figured that the only way I was going to willingly watch the sequel was when co-opted to ""baby-sit"" for her again. Hey, it's quite a long film so it keeps young Erin occupied for a crucial 2 and a half hours, but whisper it, like before, it's quite an enjoyable film.I don't know if its army of teenage followers completely get the allusions to the perils of totalitarianism, manipulation of media and the corruption of power, but Erin sort of did which has to be a good thing. Like many, I wondered how they could get Catniss and Peeta back into the arena after the conclusion to the last film, but this was skilfully done. Their disillusion with their new-found celebrity and its corruption by the powers that be naturally lead our feisty duo to rebellion and while there is the expected lengthy action inset where they bloodily battle royal with the previous champions, there's a good twist at the end setting up the next chapter which I'm sure won't be long in arriving.Yet again, the young actors in the lead roles acquit themselves very well indeed, particularly Jennifer Lawrence as Catniss. Athletic as she is, she is equally well capable of displaying the wide range of emotions her part requires of her. The senior support at her back add gravity and credibility to proceedings, the veteran (if that's the right word) triumvirate of the menacing Donald Sutherland, scheming (late) Philip Seymour-Hoffman and supportive Woody Harrelson all committing to their roles.Who knows, maybe I'll catch the next chapter without the excuse of my niece's presence, although on second thoughts it's better with her even to explain the complexities of the plot, character motivations and of course to anticipate particularly exciting or gory scenes before they occur.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire - Simply Brilliant!,"I'd read all of The Hunger Games' books and was not displeased, so when I heard there was a second film, I was very excited but also worried as a lot of sequels can sometimes ruin the original title, and in this case - the entire saga.Thankfully, the film was absolutely brilliant, they managed to fit the entire story line of the book into the film, which a lot of films these days struggle to do.The effects that were used were absolutely ecstatic, they suited each, individual scene perfectly, without overdoing it to make it look like unrealistic.Jennifer Lawrence plays Katniss so well, I honestly don't think you could find a better actress for the role, I'd probably have to say the same for Peeta, Effie, Haymitch and Caesar.I hope you enjoyed my review for The Hunger Games: Catching Fire.*RIP, Phillip Seymour Hoffman*~iHorwood",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

And this is coming from someone who HATED the book.This film may also be the most relevant to the time. It is a blatant satire of celebrity culture. Our decadent society is always one step away from the Hunger Games. The culture is decadent and violent, but this is the harsh reality of our world. It hurts, but it's so true. The movie also looks GORGEOUS! At least nominations for Makeup, Visual Effects, and Costumes, please.Is it better than the original? Certainly so. And the first one was great as well. This should have gotten more awards buzz.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"A Loyal, Honest Interpretation, it Lacks the Book's Unspoken Energy and Vibrance","Somehow even darker and more brooding than the original, which was no sunshiny walk in the park itself. Following the financial success of the first film, a lot of rough edges and awkward missteps have been ironed out in time for the next act. Most notably improved is the effects work, which had seemed just a bit too much like a video game cutscene. The new arena is convincing and beautiful, the glitz and glamor of The Capitol has been amplified appropriately, and the intricacies of the cast's showy wardrobe (which memorably underwhelmed in the first film) are far better realized. The plot is efficient, if telegraphed and incomplete: its sudden, jolting cliffhanger (which occurs, literally, right in the middle of a sentence) left me flat, even if it is laid out in precisely the same way in the source material. Much of the primary cast spends the duration wrapped up in their own sorrow, quietly brooding over their predicament while the roles of their flashier, more PR-friendly foils have been trimmed down to mere cameos. Such concessions are understandable, as the film does run quite long as it is, but the accompanying shift in tone makes this a very redundant, single-colored ride. An improvement over the first film in many ways, but the first act really drags its feet and there's a puzzling lack of enthusiasm, energy or suspense to it all.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
The CGI Games,"This film was nearly 3 hours of an emo Cabbage Patch Doll delivering monotone monologues to other angst-ridden emo teens in strange outfits.But seriously, I was just hoping for the film to exceed its predecessor and it did on some levels but was just flat out SLOW & full of unnecessary and random scenes. They could have cut out several of the pointless character-intros and had a much more powerful film. I mean, do we really need to see a tedious action sequence of people fixing up a man's whipped body? I guess that was for the ladies.Now, I do like how they are going for the 1984-feel, and I realize this is based on a book (I did not read) ... But this film's universe DOES NOT feel lived in whatsoever. Not only is it too reliant on CGI spectacle, but it does not challenge the viewers to any serious moral questions. It has chances to do so but follows the movie cliché of thinking the audience is too dumb to swallow anything besides Black Vs. White, bad guys are bad, good guys are completely innocent in every way, paradigm.And maybe they describe this world better in the book but it is absolutely ridiculous to think that the only thing this society ever talks about 24/7 is the HUNGER GAMES. Really? This prospering government with endless resources and military power spends their every living moments talking about the annual hunger games? Where are the factories or businesses that profit on the war toys or the amazing fashion technology, architecture, transportation, etc? They absolutely push the limits of dumb by pretending this world would be so obsessed with the hunger games instead of other issues in their very vast infrastructure. Just not sure how any society could thrive over anyone when their only concern in the world is the stupid annual game where emo teens kill each other. Okay, the have ""sponsors"" which are not really discussed in this film but they could have at least explained why the only thing on TV is talk about these stupid games. Just saying, it is a paper thin reality, unlike a more detailed universe like Harry Potter or LOTR.5/10 because it had some intriguing action, interesting twists, and funny CGI monkeys.

enjoyable but overrated,"This film tells the story of the victors in previous Hunger Games getting chosen to take part in a special edition of the Hunger Games.The film wants to achieve many things, including the obvious action thriller, but also achieve an emotional subplot that highlights the humanity of the lead participants. Though I like their humanity and the touching things they do, I think this emotional element distracts the action subplot, making the film less exciting. Moreover, the love subplot is very contrived. The film also spends too much time telling the story before the game, and little time during the game.Overall, I enjoyed the film but it's a little overrated.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Entertaining,"If you have witnessed the first part of Hunger Games, the second installment of the book based on the movie proves to be an entertainer.The movie starts off where the first installment left with Peeta and Katniss(Jennifer Lawrence) attempting a suicide pact. Having inspired rebellions in the districts, President Snow threatens Katniss to enact a drama that she is in love with Peeta in fear she might continue to inspire more rebellions against the Capitol which cannot be afforded. As Katniss fails to do this, Snow makes use of a special provision available in the 75th version of Hunger Games where the victors will be selected from the existing pool of victors. Snow wants to destroy her character forcing her to kill her friends while the world watches or perish in the game herself. Either way, Snow is slated to win.he Second half of the movie focus on the survival games as enemies becomes allies and allies turn foes ready to kill you the moment you are caught off guard.From the director of I am Legend and Water for Elephants, Francis Lawrence , Catching Fire makes sure your entertained right from the beginning. The story is catchy along with outstanding cinematography and impressive special effects. The first half of the movie is a drag with the build up to the action that is entirely in the second half alone. Dialogues are crisp. Background score lives up to the requirements. Jennifer Lawrence steals the show by balancing emotion with action in her role. There are some very good moments in the movie as one by one, the true nature of several people is revealed.The movie ends with a clear indication of another installment.Hunger Games:Catching Fire is definitely an improvement over the first part.

The Seeds of Rebellion Are On Fire...,"***Contains NO spoilers*** Everyone wants to be a symbol of inspiration within some point of their life. However, what if you were pressured into being that symbol against your will ...would you still accept the role? It's the basis for this year's blockbuster sequel to The Hunger Games - The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, starring Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson returning to their roles as Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mallark, current winners of the 74th Hunger Games in Panem.Life hasn't really changed much for the two main characters within this sequel. Katniss is torn between being ""in love"" with Gale Hawthrone (Liam Hemsworth) and being with Peeta as the second half of the ""starcrossed lovers"" ploy which helped them win the previous games. Outside the Winner's Quarters (where those who have won The Hunger Games along with their families live in comfort for the rest of their lives), life in District 12 has gone from worst to even more worst (if there's such a thing). And it's not just District 12 where life is looking grim but in the other districts except for 1 and 2 as well as The Capitol where those (who can afford it) live the opulent life. Poor Katniss ...she really has it bad. She's now the symbol of hope and freedom amongst the other 10 districts which gains much unwanted notice by President Snow (Donald Sutherland) and the new Games Keeper Plutarch Heavensbee (diabolically portrayed by Philip Seymour Hoffman). Both who plot to bring the downfall of Katniss Everdeen in hopes of squashing the rebellious uprisings in the districts during the victors' Victory Tour. Yet, not everything goes according to plan for President Snow who ultimately decides to pull a fast one by announcing that ALL past and current victors of The Hunger Games will compete in the 75th Hunger Games which is also known as the 3rd Quarter Quell. This sneaky move pits Katniss and Peeta fighting much more than their ""starcrossed lovers"" premise because rules have changed ...there can be one winner in this game. Can they save each other before President Snow tries to destroy them both?Sorry, no spoilers here! You have to see The Hunger Games: Catching Fire yourself to find out what happens to Katniss, Peeta, Gale, Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) and the other colorful cast of characters that make up the fantastical world of Panem in this sequel. SouthSide enjoyed how the movie itself quickly opens by instantly drawing you into the storyline where the first ended without any titles or opening credits (like the previous movie). You immediately get the sense of how bleak things have become not in just District 12 but in the other districts while Peeta and Katniss embark on their victory tour. And even before that, you get the sense of how times have changed for Panem when President Snow makes a surprise visit to Katniss blackmailing her to live up to the image that was created for her ...or suffer the consequences. Not her per se but her family and Gale. Yet, that's one of many problems weighing our young heroine down. She has to live up to the ""chins up and smiles on"" during the glitz and glamour parties hosted within The Capitol as the ever fabulously stylish Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) escorts them around the districts along with Cinna (Lenny Kravitz) and the team of stylists keep them looking good. The action before the games (which is played on a new game grid with a unique tropical twist) is somewhat fast pace but not slow because the story within this sequel will keep your interest going. Yet once the games begin, expect the unexpected while Heavensbee upping the treacherous dangers cleverly disguised as a way to kill Katniss in the process. Again, kudos for stealing Lady Gaga's current Artpop style. This reviewer absolutely LOVED the costume designs which were inspired by the late Alexander McQueen used for the sequel ...you can clearly see his work when Katniss wears her ""wedding dress"" (watch for a surprise designed by Cinna). This reviewer is certain that some of Effie's colorful attire could be found Gaga's closet sometime soon ...if not now.Overall, go see The Hunger Games: Catching Fire while it's showing in theatres but hopefully it's not a long wait for The Hunger Games: Mockingjay since the final scenes to this movie will surprise you (unless you read the books).",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Thankfully MUCH Better Than The First Installment,"In some ways I was pretty reluctant in seeing this next installment of The Hunger Games film series because -1) the first film bored the ever-loving pants off me (a view I still stand by), so I wasn't sure if I would want to see the next film.2) I was intrigued to see what DID happen next.However, after seeing The Hunger Games: Catching Fire I was actually surprised and I'll hold my hands up and say that it IS actually a very good film. Like I said, the first film was boring and very over-hyped, but this time it went the opposite way.In saying that, though, it didn't start off that way as the first 40 minutes or so of this film was slow and I did actually think it was going to be worse than the first movie. Thankfully, it DID get better from about the hour mark, picking up in both pace & action. The acting wasn't anything special but it was believable and solid with good performances from Lawrence, Hoffman, and especially Harrelson.Some elements of the first film that I didn't like have returned for this installment, the main one being the ridiculous Alice in Wonderland type costumes. Whether it's like that in the books or not I don't know as I've not read them, but that still doesn't stop me from thinking that some of the costumes were completely out of place. Some of the costumes just made it seem that you were watching two different film genres, but this is confined to mainly the first 40 or so minutes so.Now, I'm definitely not a die-hard Hunger Games fan, but even I'll admit that it's getting very tiresome seeing the continual comparisons between this and the Battle Royale films. It was interesting to start with but I honestly wish people would just shut up about the comparisons because quite frankly it's becoming very tiresome & boring seeing it all the time. We all KNOW the films are similar, but enough is enough.Anyway, if, like me, you almost gave up the series after watching the first film, stick with it because this one is MUCH better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Well-Done Futuristic  Political Thriller,"This is a sequel to 2012's HUNGER GAMES, and is set in the same future world: a post-apocalyptic world where an Empire, called Panem, has imposed peace on the survivors only to decay into brutal tyranny. The symbol of the tyranny is the Hunger Games, a gladiator-type combat where only one ""victor"" is permitted and the rest of the fighters die. To keep the flow of victims coming, 12 districts of Panem are required each year to supply a teenage boy and girl for the fight, ostensibly as punishment for decades-old rebellion.The theme of this movie is the moral issues over how to oppose such tyranny. Katniss Everdeen ( Jennifer Lawrence), the spirited girl who won the previous year's Games, wishes to stop the oppression, but fears that outright revolution will hurt too many people. There is another character (whom I won't identify to avoid spoilers) who doesn't care how many people are hurt as long as the revolution is advanced. Many of the subjects of the Empire are resigned to submitting until some messianic deliverer will appear. Meanwhile the ruthless President-for-life Coriolanus Snow ( Donald Sutherland) is determined to destroy the rebels before they can get organized. Who will win out? Therein lies the suspense.There's enough special effects to make the futuristic background and technology credible without overwhelming the movie.Aside from Lawrence and Sutherland as the impressive antagonists, the movie has a strong supporting cast: Woody Harrelson as Katniss's shrewd but alcoholic mentor; Liam Hemworth and Josh Hutcherson as two boys representing the aggressive vs sensitive sides of Katniss's character; Elizabeth Banks as a kindly but naive woman oblivious to the tyranny; Oscar-winner Philip Hoffman as Snow's Machiavellian adviser, and Sam Clafin, Jeffrey Wright, and Jena Malone as formidable former victors drawn into the conflict.The movie's only real flaw is that being part of a continuing story keeps the plot from being resolved in the end.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Movie of the series that you don't want to miss out!!,"well if you a fan of action , fighting , and romance. I can tell you that you came to the right movie.The Hunger Games:Catching Fire is all about it from the lovable scene to the emotion and exciting fighting all in one movie.This particular part of The Hunger Book series is all what you need to see,to get your attention of exciting for the up coming part.Jennifer Lawrence cast as Katniss Everdeen whom the girl that live on the district that every year they will need volunteers to tribute in their game to fight for life.well as you may herded that Katniss is so bad ass in this movie but i has to tell you Josh Hutcherson as peeta Mellark is my favorite character in the movie because of the love that he give to his beloved once is so real.As I seen the movie I can't get my mind right because of the emotion that each character give to us it's so real the way they interact are way beyond.The movie make me can't sleep due to the excitement for what next of the book series.I got to tell you that the fighting action are one of the memorable scene so far.It'll get you stood up by how it all was went down .All the feel I got hit me just like a train it's just so much word can't even describe.Man this story..I can't get enough of it.Once thing tho,I personally didn't like how the director put the hot actor as main character like some of the viewers like this for them not how they play role but i guess the director need to get some fan by that i guess to promote their movie faster due to well known of the star.I would recommend this movie for teenager that love relationship drama , action , sci-fic .The Hunger Game:Catching Fire is not the greatest movie ever but greater if i would said from the first series I like every detail that they put into the movie based on the book by not ripping off the original.I suggest y'all to watch this Movie.I'd personally rate this 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

A very satisfying sequel,"""The Hunger Games"" can be compared to ""His Dark Materials' - two novel trilogies that I have read and enjoyed immensely. Both were written for young adults but have crossed over into popularity with a general readership. Both are set in a world related to ours, but profoundly different, and feature a resourceful female protagonist. But, whereas (sadly) the attempt to film ""His Dark Materials"" started and finished with the opening novel (""The Golden Compass""), it was always clear that the movie adaptation of ""The Hunger Games"" was - like the ""Twilight"" series - going to go all the way. In fact, ""The Hunger Games"" films are making far more money at the box office than ""Twilight"" because - in my view - the themes are much more realistic and the central actress, Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen, is so accomplished.The author of the novels Suzanne Collins continues to act as an executive producer and is ensuring that the films are faithful to the books and, as long as she and Lawrence stick with the series, it can only grow and grow. In fact, since the first movie Lawrence - like the heroine she portrays - has become bigger than the Games, as she has now won a well-deserved Academy Award for ""Silver Linings Playbook"". Meanwhile ""Catching Fire"" had twice the budget of the original film and the result is superior production values.In this very satisfying sequel, it is a year on from the opening salvo: Katniss and her co- victor (the rather weak Josh Hutcherson as Peeta) have to go on the Victory Tour, where they find rebellion is in the air, before finding themselves sucked back into the arena as a result of a particularly cruel Quarter Quell which requires all this year's Games contestants to be drawn from previous winners. There is a new Games master (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman) and new murderous challenges in the gladiatorial battlefield. And, at the end of it all (almost two and a half hours later), the final line of dialogue is identical to that of the book and sets us up brilliantly for Part 3A.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Excellent Drama. Riveting,"President Snow (Donald Sutherland) fears that Katniss Everdeen's (Jennifer Lawrence) victory in the last Hunger Games threatens his rule and declares a Quell whereby the winners of all previous Games will go head-to-head with each other. And, he hopes Katniss will be defeated and not win giving Hope to the people to overthrow him.So here we go watching Katniss prepare for the new Games. She knows she must go through with it or her family will be murdered. She is grateful that, this time, young children will not be killed as in the last Games. And, gone is the benefit that a previous Hunger Games winner will enjoy a life of ease. Now all previous winners must participate and they don't like it.The first half of this is slow, but we are watching Katniss deal with everything and tension and suspense abound. The thing that struck me were the dialogues as they kept me riveted to my seat. The dialogues were spot on with honesty and subtle anger and humor at times. An example of subtle anger: Katniss tells the President, ""why don't you kill me now?"" Of course Snow would like to, but he needs everything to be legal and so the Quell. Snow still fears Hope among the people and Katniss as the cause of it, and that must be put to rest.We are introduced to the other players, but once the Games begin, we only see bits and pieces of them. What we don't see are the people watching on TV like we saw in the first movie.All in all, this is excellent drama and we have the same fears as Katniss and are wary of everything around us. um, I mean her. Plutarch (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) is the one we are most wary about as he is the Games Master and pulls all strings (read obstacles) during the Games. We need to watch him very carefully.One of the most dramatic scenes is when Katniss is introduced to the people again, and she comes out in a wedding dress and what happens next tells President Snow that he is being mocked. Great stuff.The acting by all is excellent but, Jennifer Lawrence must be singled out as she is perfect. And, the questions begin: will Katniss go with Team Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) or Team Gayle (Liam Hemsworth)? Will the Hunger Games finally stop? Will the revolution actually take place? Inquiring minds are at it again.The ending is too abrupt and we don't like it, but we are reminded that other sequels are in play and we will find out more in the next movie and we can't wait.

Decent? Yes. Conceptional? No.,"I have not read the books, I was somehow invited to see the 1st installment, which I did not like so much, but there is always hope for the better... Especially when both movies have received so much praise and accolades. But alas, again, similar ambivalent feelings, as the plot is uneven, at times protracted, games themselves start in the 2nd half of the movie, unnecessary explanations alternate with indistinct scenes... The reasons for such an ending is understandable, but I would still prefer a kind of solution, round-up for each and every part.The best thing in the movie are ""older"" actors, starting from Woody Harrelson and ending with Amanda Plummer. The younger ones had not much impression on me, I know dozens of more versatile and distinct actors aged 30 and below, e.g. Paul Dano, Anton Yelchin, Joseph Gordon-Lewitt, Emma Watson, Zoe Kazan; the phenomenon of Jennifer Lawrence is still mystery to me, well, I will try to peruse this by watching Winter's Bone as soon as possible :) Well, I do still not comprehend what is the real target audience and how/why the movie has obtained so many viewers and box office.

Katniss Catches the World on Fire!,"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is an excellent sequel to the pleasantly surprising 2012 hit, the Hunger Games. The basic plot is the same, but the stakes are higher. The social commentary is pushed across better this time around under the sure-handed direction of Francis Lawrence, who also made the right decision to forgo the shaky camera routine. The production design remain a highlight of the series and same goes for the costumes and makeup. Effie's wardrobe is weird, but very colorful. The film, especially when we get to the Games, is action-packed and some of those sequences are just breath-taking. Finally, the ending of the movie is a toughie because it has the best cliffhanger in any movie I seen in recent memory.Francis Lawrence, who takes over the director title from Gary Ross, continues the adventure of Katniss. After winning the Hunger Games, Katniss and Peeta go on tour to the other districts, where people see them as a sign of hope and rebellion, much to the anger of President Snow. With the new gameskeeper Plutarch, the Capital decides to issue forth another set of Games, this time called the Quarter Quell with involves only previous Games winners. Once again, Katniss must rely on her wit, friends, and her bow in order to stay alive.Unlike many young-adult series, this film has perfect acting. Jennifer Lawrence is just amazing as Katniss. Josh Hutcherson is pretty good as Peeta, though he may be the weakest link. Donald Sutherland makes a very creepy and evil Snow. The late Philip Seymour Hoffman is a fantastic addition to the cast. Woody Harrelson, as usual, does wonders to give the film a few jokes. Elizabeth Banks is quite.....colorful as Effie. Finally, Jeffrey Wright and Jena Malone are two key additions to the cast because they are essential members needed for the Games.Overall, the sequel is bigger and better than the first film. This is one of the best cinematic franchises in recent history, and definitely the best young adult franchise since Harry Potter. It's rare for these kind of films to receive such critical support. It helps that I love these kind of dystopian films and it doesn't hurt when there is excellent acting and a huge production design to speak of. I also love that new Coldplay song, ""Atlas,"" which is sung in the end credits. But that ending really has me itching for the Mockingjay films. The first film was excellent, but Catching Fire is beyond excellent. I rate this film 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"An Expansion of ""The Hunger Games"" Story","It goes without saying that a sequel builds on the storyline of its direct predecessor. This is of course true for ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"", but the way in which this happens is an expansion of the original story, rather than simply a telling of a new ""Hunger Games"" episode.Here's what I mean. Some sequels attempt to take the basic model of the original film and to essentially replicate the story in a way that the film becomes a copy of the first film (""The Hangover"" films come to mind). Other films play out more like a television series, in which the sequel builds into an ongoing drama. ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" is the latter.If you're familiar with ""The Matrix"" trilogy of films, you'll know what I mean here. Like ""The Matrix"" films, ""The Hunger Games"" sequel advances the plot of the original film in a way that is expansive. Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark's story takes on new life, all the while introducing new characters, a new edition of the annual Hunger Games bloodsport event, and ultimately a cliff hanger ending that is sure to leave you hungry for the next chapter.That said, the big question surrounding this film is whether its expansive nature works. To allude once again to ""The Matrix"" trilogy, we know that expansive sequels that veer in a different direction from the original don't always fair well.Whether or not ""Catching Fire"" suffers from the same drawbacks as ""The Matrix"" sequels is a matter of opinion. The first time I saw the film (during its original theatrical release run), I wasn't sold on it as being quite as good as the original. I'd still stand by that assessment, but upon a second viewing I must say that the movie has grown on me.I will note that ""Catching Fire"" is a film that deserves a close viewing--it's not a film that one wants to watch with divided attention, unless you've seen it several times and know the story by heart. If you're not in that camp, you'll find that the expansive nature of the film demands attention, otherwise it might be easy to get lost.But while the film is an expansion on the original, and while it certainly introduces new elements to the plot of the overall series, the good news is that it does this in a good way. While the original still stands out as a wonderful standalone film, ""Catching Fire"" is a well made, well produced sequel that is immersive if given a chance.That said, I'd give this film 7/10 stars. The movie is a bit weaker than the original, but it nonetheless delivers a powerful movie experience with a plot that engages the viewer and makes one care about the characters as their story advances into a new chapter in the ""Mocking Jay"" movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Decent sequel, hugely successful","Released in late 2013, ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" is the second film in the franchise based on Suzanne Collins' popular books. A new nation, Panem, exists in post-apocalyptic North America where Capitol is the seat of Panem's wealthy, eccentric populace and the cruel totalitarian government led by the pompous President Snow (Donald Sutherland). The winners of The Hunger Games depicted in the first film, Katniss & Peeta (Jennifer Lawrence & Josh Hutcherson), tour the districts to pacify the masses, but revolution is astir. So Snow declares another Hunger Game involving victors from all the districts where only one of 24 players will survive. Liam Hemsworth plays Katniss' boyfriend, Gale, while Philip Seymour Hoffman, Woody Harrelson, Lenny Kravitz and Elizabeth Banks play characters who seem to be on her side. Jena Malone is on hand as one of the players, amongst others.I'm not a huge fan of The Hunger Games films, but I'll watch 'em. I gave the first one a 7/10. This sequel is a natural extension and it's decent, but nothing mind-blowing. Because of the franchise's built-in audience ""Catching Fire"" was a massive success at the box office.

"Not perfect, but worth the ticket price","When we last left the Districts of Panem (?), Katniss Everdeen (??) and Peeta Mellark (???) defied all odds by winning the 74th Hunger Games, which also started the rumblings of a revolution. Now, President Snow (ok that's not terrible) decides the best way to put the people back in their places is to force previous winners (including Katniss) to participate once again in the ""Quarter Quell"" (sure...), a special Hunger Games celebrating the 75th anniversary. With mentor and former victor Haymitch Abernathy (WHO???) behind them, can they survive the new game put together by new gamerunner Plutarch Heavensbee? (OH COME ON...)...Seriously, what kind of random-generating name machine did Suzanne Collins use when she wrote these characters??Crazy names aside, this movie packs a serious punch. Jennifer Lawrence once again owns the role, and the rest of the cast does a solid job. (A side note: I would pay TRIPLE the price to see a version of Hunger Games where Woody Harrelson MURDERS EVERYONE in some exotic location. Can we get a movie about the Hunger Games that his character won? BOX OFFICE GOLD right there...screw Peeta, that panzy.) Visuals are beautiful (especially those costumes), but 3D is unnecessary. The story moves along at a steady pace, and you get some really great character development along with some beautifully done, emotional scenes. (Katniss' speech in the 11th district was intense.)One thing that bugs me: this movie clocks in at 2 1/2 hours. Of that time, we get roughly 15 minutes of action. There was SOOO MUCH BUILD-UP towards the actual Games, and all the development and plot lines were great, but man...couldn't we have seen at least a little more of the action? What about the non-team-Katniss participants? I want to see EVERYTHING. I PAID TO SEE 23 PEOPLE GET OFF'ED, DON'T SHORT-CHANGE ME.All in all, Catching Fire is a solid flick that is just as good as the first, if not better. 3.5 out of 5 on the BDBOS.""Don't forget who the enemy is.""""...people with normal names?""""...yes.""(Hey guys, thanks for checking out my review.

A great movie but there are flaws,"Important note:I didn't read the books!I gave the first movie a 9 out of 10 and definitely looked forward to this one. All in all I am very satisfied and liked this movie but there are a few flaws that made rate this one 1 spot lower. I'll try to explain without giving a spoiler, but my small issues will probably only be understood after watching. I do recommend watching.The acting was solid,the story solid, and it was entertaining. What I subtracted points for is that there is a practical issue when it comes to being able to include/represent all districts. Hopefully this isn't a spoiler, but there is only 1 winner in each evolution of the Hunger Games with the exception being Peta and Catness. 1 winner, not one female and one male winner. Since that last movie stated that ""some"" Districts have volunteers every year and are a virtual shoe in to win. It makes it puzzling to even have a queue.My second demotion was that I think that the main event was some what mailed in compared to the first film just utilized to bring the movie to the most important part, the end.Those aren't huge issues and most people won't catch it or even care.This was a pretty good movie, so watch it!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Katniss is cool,"I've never read any of these books, but have now seen both Hunger Games films. Catching Fire was pretty good. Jennifer Lawrence does a fine acting job as Katniss. As does evil Donald Sutherland as the President. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays the Gamemaker. Woody Harrelson turns in his quirky Haymus (sp) role.The films basic premise is that the victors from previous HG competitions now have to fight against each other because of some special 75th anniversary. That premise was kind of silly, bu whatever. As Peeta and Katniss get paraded around, revolution foments in all districts.I guess we will finally find out what happens in part 3, the Mockingjay, which is apparently going to be released as a Part 1 and Part 2, a la Harry Potter 7. They must milk out ever penny possible.That's about it. Not a lot more to say. I enjoyed this story, the acting, the colors, the fight scenes...all good stuff. Enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
The same but better,"I only have read the first book of the Hunger Games, but seen both movies. The first movie had to be restrained and was compared to a Japanese movie (not without a reason). While this seems a bit like a rehash of the same, it is way better in execution. It's still a bit too long and has some issues, but the comedy bits do work in its favor and there seems to be a switch in pace.Twists aside (which should actually be apparent), most will be looking forward to the conclusion with the third book getting released too. Unfortunately (or is it fortunately?) the third book will be getting the split movie treatment. Until then (and lets hope it won't be the same again, because they will get out of options with doing it again ... and again), enjoy this and Jennifer Lawrence in it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Catching Fire review,"I never felt that the first Hunger Games movie was all that bad, but it's certainly not without its flaws. Chief among them were the issues that the threat was not present enough, and the pathos of the characters were not sufficiently developed. These were just a few of the nuances that seems to have translated better in writing than on-screen.Fortunately, Catching Fire is not just a mere follow-up on the first film; it's an opportunity to rectify the first film's shortcomings and present a much more sublime adaptation of the second novel in the series. The film starts a little slow, taking the necessary time to cover some important ground with the background and characters, before the plot rockets ahead. I've always felt that the scenes in District 11 would be a pretty hard-hitting scene, and the film did not disappoint. From then on, the suspense builds systematically through a series of actions and reactions, based largely in the characters' predicaments. When the actual Quarter Quell starts, it is a pretty fast and intense match that not only involves a lot of bloodshed, but also some crazy environmental hazards and one ambitious endgame. It all culminates in a captivating series of twists and revelations that will inevitably lead into the full-blown revolution that will come in the Mockingjay films (and the film did a fine job of psyching me up for it). Once it got going, the film moved pretty fast, smooth, and with a perfect level of nuance and detail to fully emphasize the significance of the story and the pathos of the characters.And that's what's really awesome about the film: the storytelling, which is probably as perfect of an adaptation to the book as it can get. It's not just a paint-by-the-numbers replication of the book's scenes; it seems as though the filmmakers took a deeper look at the source material to bring out the characters better (including all the minor characters, who seem to shine much more in this film), and craft a plot that makes better sense. A few minor details are cut out, but are not really missed; the film crams in so much from the book without feeling crowded, and it is pretty much exactly what I pictured it would be from reading the text. So overall, it is a fine story told really well.Another great thing that's fixed is the camera work: all the crappy shaky-cam shots are gone, and the photography remains solid, steady, and good overall. Editing is equally decent. Acting is decent: Jennifer Lawrence IS Katniss Everdeen. All the other players felt pretty iffy before, but in this film, everybody feels much more natural and much more important than before; they all pull their weight for good effect. Writing is good. This production has some great-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects (yes, even the SFX have improved), all of which match up with the first film well, but without appearing gaudy or anything. Music is pretty good too.The Hunger Games films have finally caught on fire with this sequel. Following the book in both plot and spirit, the film is a successful adaptation. It's more competent, more hard-hitting, more consistently engaging, and it even had moments that I felt were brilliant or beautiful. Fans of the book should enjoy this tremendously, while casual audiences might be able to connect with it better than the first film.

It's Worth Your Money!,"So how bad was that first Hunger Games movie? Pretty bad, huh? I'm sure there's a few teenage girls out there whom just rage quit this review, but I digress. This review isn't about the first Hunger Games movie. It is in-fact about ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,"" the first sequel in a quadrilogy of movies based on a trilogy of books by Suzane Collins. While I'm not going to claim this movie is cinematic gold (it's not even close), I will say it was highly entertaining. Catching fire really stepped up the story from it's predecessor. There was far less mindless action scenes, and far more goosebumps on my arms as we follow a nation on the brink of revolution. That's not to say there isn't a fair amount of action in this movie, cause in-fact there is. I'm just saying the action in Catching Fire feels far more relevant, as compared to the first movie. The revolution in Panem is knocking at the door, and looking for Katniss as it's leader. Check out more of my reviews over at WatchPlayRead!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Don't believe the fangurls!,"Not a good movie at all. How it gets an 8.2 average IMDb rating I'll never know. The dialogue is written for (and maybe BY?!?) 12 year olds; the story is, to be kind, contrived; and the acting/direction make you feel like you're watching one of those TV shows that somehow manages to have a huge budget but also low production values. Don't waste your time. Of course, the movie will haul in a ton of money and so everyone involved in making it will receive attention and accolades, but this turkey is definitely not going home with any of the big prizes this award season, except maybe a Razzie. How can the reviewers above think that this schlocky film is anything even remotely approaching some sort of cinematic masterpiece? Studio plants: that's the only explanation that makes sense, right?",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Much more mature than the first.,"Since I have not read the books of The Hunger Games, I cannot comment on how well the movies follow them or not, but I really enjoy the movies. I thought the first one was great, though there was a certain lack of violence that made it feel tweeny. Catching Fire was a lot more serious and mature.It continues from where the first film finished, Katniss and Peeta are on their victory tour, and of course the Capitol is not happy with how the last Hunger Games panned out. Their is civil unrest in all the districts, which results in the Capitol clamping down in a couple of rather fittingly upsetting scenes.I was glad to find that the new director had gotten rid of the shaky cam the previous film had so much of during action scenes. The action is much more steady in Catching Fire.Jennifer Lawrence is again outstanding as Katniss, who is suffering PTSD, and is a beacon of hope to the people of the 12 districts, even as she tries to back away from it so that her family and friends do not suffer for it. She comes off as naturally conflicted and scared.Although Woody Harrelson and Lenny Kravitz are excellent as Haymitch and Cinna, I felt that Effie (Elizabeth Banks) stood out the most from Katniss' team. While in the first film she was just a lackey for the Capitol, in Catching Fire, she expresses a more human side as Katniss and Peeta are forced to go through their ordeal a second time.Overall Catching Fire is much more mature than it's predecessor, with some emotional moments and stellar acting, and much more steady action sequences with the shaky cam technique done away with. I look forward to the final installment in the series.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
I just found it better than the first...,"Whatever you say I am not a big fan of this franchise. I did not like much the first installment other than a decent entertainment. So this was another 'let it go' movie from me. But when the time came to see it, I was a little surprised of being better than the first. The second hour was good and before one was a mild slow. The real interest is the, follow-up movies from here on. The end of this part created a curiosity for the next movies of the series. Looks like it would be very interesting with big changes in story than first two.The movie series supposed to be a trilogy, but you know it tasted big commercial success that mean big buck in filmmakers pocket. In 2013 this movie was the highest gross from north America. So like 'Deathly Hollows' and 'Breaking Dawn' this franchise following the same path by breaking the third volume into two. Whatever, I am expecting the third and the fourth movies 'Mockingjay part I and II' would have more exciting than previous movies with many twists and turns.It was so sad to hear about Philip Seymour's sudden tragic demise. His best parts are yet to come in the next movies of the movie series. The franchise told they wrapped most of his portions of the last two volumes and now they decided to make minor changes in his character. That's good to hear, hope he it will be an unforgettable show from the great actor.The end scene before the credits roll the logo of 'Catching Fire' changes into 'Mockingjay'. It was awesome, I just sensed some great is ahead. So like teenagers, it interested me and created curiosity. Looks like I got reason to watch 'Mockingjay' movies.7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
the production team was very professional,"I watched the first one. And it was a disappointment. There are quite a few movies with the exact same story. And all I have seen are better than the Hunger Games. But I was told this is a revolutionary concept. So maybe the second one will show the revolution. Nope.The production team was very professional. The main actress has the best face in her life. And, as prosthetic, it looks quite fake. I mean anywhere the light is placed in the scene, the highlights on her plastic face look the same. Still, it shows well on the film posters. The costumes and backgrounds were very creative. They needed a new world look, after Harry Potter and Star Wars and Star Trek and hundreds of others. And they have it. Only I find them terribly ugly. I don't know. Maybe they were supposed to be ugly to make the clothing in the districts look nice. Weird.And that is about all. There is no revolution. The story probably follows the books. And the author just shows the privileged rich life spent so far. So the result is some sort of revolutionary Kens disobeying dictator Barbie.The districts are poorer and poorer as the number increases. Yet people are all equally fit. The hunger games has people that are fat by any dictatorship standard.I also disliked the use of token people that ended up enhancing the racism of the story. Sure, the blacks are the most poor. But not as poor as the star winners. In the end the poor whites are more miserable than the blacks. Than the districts seem to be racially divided. Than you get some black person in the crowd, yet probably the black person was neutered or something because nowhere outside the capital is there any race mixing.What is worse is the revolutionary book about a revolution is teaching teens to be sheep. One can be close and unguarded next to the dictatorial figure and. And do nothing. Show some mild contempt. One can be on live TV and shout in equal measure useless and hysterical slogans. And they all go to their killing just like that. But they scare the system with a gesture. Anyway, the revolution is less in this movie than on the evening news.Bottom line: a script that has more holes than Swiss cheese that teaches obedience and passivity. Even the Disney movies don't reach that low with the indoctrination.Contact me with Questions, Comments or Suggestions ryitfork @ bitmail.ch",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

Excellent film! Better than the first...,"Just got back from watching the movie and I must say, it was awesome. I have not read the books yet, so I can't really comment on how faithful the movie is to the series; however, I do think several aspects are worth noting: - Jennifer Lawrence reminded me she is a great actress and maybe even finished convincing me that her Oscar was deservedly earned (I was rooting for Jessica Chastain to win best actress and still supported her up until today); JL shows acting experience beyond her age. - The plot is definitely better than the first movie. The first, although entertaining, was rather predictable and even 'plain'; the second film, on the other hand, addresses politics more harshly while still having plenty action packed scenes. - The direction is also worth noting: costume, makeup and setting are once again brilliant; special effects are also pretty wicked.Last but not least, throughout the entire movie the audience managed to laugh, cry, gasp and even scream. Definitely worth the watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

Chapter two is a notch below the first chapter,"THE HUNGER GAMES (2012, 7/10) is a harbinger of another monolith box-office knockout with quite different teen spirit from TWILIGHT franchise. Its dystopian milieux strike as a resounding backbone to carry its social onus which is unusual to be seen among its peers. As the second part of the trilogy-turns-quartet (a lame strategy when shifts from the source novel to its cinematic adaption), CATCHING FIRE basically is an amped-up survival battle as its predecessor (with an elaborate overture to dovetail its storyline development), new helmer Francis Lawrence (I AM LEGEND 2007, 8/10; CONSTANTINE 2005, 7/10) barely achieves a middle-of-the-road tactic to fulfill his demanding task.Since I tend to divide movie from its source material, I am a piece of blank paper towards the plot and its characters' ominous destiny, so the great pleasure comes from newcomers (name- checking Sam Claflin and Jena Malone) in the series since it did pique my curiosity to know whether they will survive in the end, both actors are camera-friendly and vividly evoke laughters and empathy. So tracking back to the love triangle, Hemsworth's part is tapering down quickly meanwhile J. Lawrence and Hutcherson manage to breakout from their asymmetrical relationship, although judging from all levels, she looks like a big sister (and caretaker) to him, but which also accomplishes an unorthodox heroine and hero pair against all odds. Tucci and Banks are as excellent as they could be with their flamboyant antics, while veteran Sutherland and Harrelson are unequivocally underemployed as the antagonist and the mentor respectively, plus the new blood Hoffman doesn't seem to exhaust too much effort to accentuate the final twist.So it all strips down to Jennifer Lawrence's emotional curve out and out, save her swaying affections towards two boys, her awakening sense as a token of rebellion trudges through a laboriously-designed victories' tour, which also gives Katniss (passively though) a strong conviction what will become her goal in the chapters to come, the great part of the story has just begun!I watched it on an IMAX screen, and the effect is no more than satisfactory, during the game time, the CGI looks cheaper and faker than usual top-notch Hollywood output, the entire hue is also a shade darker in view of its 2D default, one can barely get the full idea what is happening during the high points. Brightness aside, the definition of the images is another disappointing factor. So maybe one crucial reason (my own conspiracy theory) is that the cinemas' apparatus is not equivalent between here in Shanghai and in USA, where it gained raving reviews, but as far as I am concerning, the technique bloopers are too blatant to overlook, markedly mar the movie for me, but I will keep as loyal as possible for the remaining two successors (both will still be under the tiller of Francis Lawrence), just because Julianne Moore is on board now as a key role, god bless the mockingjay!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Just as good as the original.,"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire continues with the story of Katniss Everdeen(Jennifer Lawrence), 'The Girl on Fire'. After the events of The Hunger Games, Katniss & Peeta Mellark(Josh Hutcherson) go on a victory tour to the districts of Panem. In the various districts, people look up to Katniss as a symbol of hope. Fearing that a rebellion may be round the corner, President Snow(Donald Sutherland) along with Plutarch Heavensbee(Philip Seymour Hoffman) come up with a plan to get rid of Katniss. They organize The Hunger Games: Quarter Quell, in celebration of the 75th Hunger Games & throw, Katniss, Peeta & a couple of other victors back into the arena. Katniss' worst nightmare comes true as she has to take part in the Games, yet again. Now, it is up to Katniss & Peeta, with a little help from mentor, Haymitch Abernathy(Woody Harrelson), to survive at any cost.This film was as engaging as the original. The Games had many more lethal threats, this time around. This made it a lot more fun & thrilling to watch. The ending of the film felt abrupt & left me somewhat disappointed. Other than this teeny, tiny flaw, the film was flawless from start to finish. Once again, the star of the show is Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen. Lawrence carries the film on her shoulders. Josh Hutcherson is brilliant as Peeta Mellark. Liam Hemsworth is great as Gale Hawthorne. Woody Harrelson is spectacular as Haymitch Abernathy. Donald Sutherland is outstanding as President Snow. Philip Seymour Hoffman is mind blowing as Plutarch Heavensbee. Elizabeth Banks is hysterical as Effie Trinket. Lenny Kravitz is effective as Cinna. Stanley Tucci is hilarious as Caesar Flickerman. Sam Claflin is impressive as Finnick Odair. Jena Malone is good as Johanna Mason. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a must watch. Enjoy the wild ride!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Bleak.,"""The Hunger Games"" when it came out, promised to be more than just another young adult story thanks to flashes of some tasteful dystopia - a theme that continues and expands in the second episode of the trilogy, ""Catching Fire"".""Bleak"" is a word that springs to mind when describing Katniss Everdeen's latest adventure, and it has all the bearings of a world gone wrong - wanton executions, oppression and a simmering rebellion against the some who rule over the many. Unfortunately, the film spends little time elaborating on these important issues and the world fades into the background of the travails of the reluctant heroine played ably by Jennifer Lawrence who is maturing into a very capable actor with every film. Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland, Elizabeth Banks and the newcomer Philip Seymour Hoffman all provide great support.The film is long at over 2 hrs runtime, but never drags thanks to some good pacing, compelling visuals and believable acting. ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" serves as a bridge between the first and final episodes with little material to offer on its own, but works mostly, thanks to some characters who you come to care for, and more importantly, root for. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
the messenger cannot be allowed to continue,"First, I should note that I had never heard of the ""Hunger Games"" books until the first movie got released.

The sequel continues the story, showing how Panem's rulers feel threatened by Katniss's popularity among the oppressed populations and try to co-opt her. One scene in particular looks exactly like something out of Coliseum games in ancient Rome.""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" turned out to be Philip Seymour Hoffman's last movie released before he died.

Much Better than the First,"I hated the first ""Hunger Games"" movie. It wasn't just bad in my opinion, it was dreadful (Poor acting, too Disney-like, poor story line, lame special effects, etc). I honestly had no desire to go see this movie based on how bad the first one was. However, it was the only thing playing and my date wanted to go see it, so we did. Wow, what a difference- this movie was an dramatically-different movie than the first movie,the horribly-flawed counterpart. And part two...well to my surprise it's GOOD!There was actual acting in this one, not brilliant but there was acting going on, the movie felt much richer (it was clear that this movie actually cost a good amount of money to make), the story was captivating (so much so that despite what-felt-like a long run time I was hoping the movie would keep going at the end instead of leaving us hanging on for Part 3).The addition of Philip Hoffman to the cast was a stroke of genius- this guy can act. He's THE BEST REAL ACTOR in this movie and helps pick up many of the loose ends that are left by some of the less-than-stellar actors out there. He adds credibility to the not-overly-talented group of actors that were assembled for this movie. So bravo for actually bringing in a heavyweight to the movie.Overall, I give the movie an 8/10. The only parts where the movie fails in my opinion are the (1) ""CHEESEBALL FACTOR."" One example- this guy brings this old woman into the Hunger Games out of Chivalry/Cockiness and then there is some ambiguity about whether they are dating- it's very odd and felt more like a scene out of comedy than a death match; (2)I still don't fully buy the darkness of the HUNGER GAMES- a death match would be more brutal than is portrayed- BUT, huge BUT because this movie is light years darker than the first one,It's dark enough that I'm happy with it, and it was believable enough. (3) I am not a fan of the PITA character. The character is a complete waste of space- he says the lamest lines, the actor who plays him is TERRIBLE... he's the worst in the movie, he over acts big time and plays attitude and mood (big no no's for acting)- He's weak sauce and the relationship between him and ""Catness"" is beyond cheesy and unrealistic. His name is completely lame- all I can think about is THE BREAD or THE ANIMALS RIGHTS ORGANIZATION. His lame/weak performance. IN FAIRNESS- I think this was more about bad casting than anything else- they could have easily switched him and the guy Catness loves/dates back home and all of a sudden you have a better casting decision and better movie.Aside from a few nit-picky gripes, good movie! Much improved. I grade is somewhere in the ""B+/A-"" range.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Brilliantly dark!,"Deep, dark, inspiring, funny, depressing are all words that describe my significant other... and The Hunger Games: Catching Fire as well. The cliffhanger at the end will compel you to go home from the movie theater, go in your garage, and attempt to make a time machine out of power tools and foil so that you can fast forward to next year and watch the finale of the trilogy.We all know what happens next but I'm more appreciative the message in the movie. It is a fascinating satire of our current society. The extravagant costumes and breathtaking synthetic beauty of the Panem Capital is a scathing critique of Hollywood and most of the mindless garbage that it puts out in order to distract and numb us from the real issues at hand. I couldn't help but think of the irony as I sat there watching the movie.Our heroine Katniss has a duty to fulfill and is reluctant to step into her fated shoes.

Makes for an average movie if you haven't read the book.,"As 'scorpeeo' so rightly puts it, you have to read the book in order to appreciate the movie. That being said, I didn't care one bit if any character lived or die mainly because I didn't read the book. The main problem with the movie is that the director did not take enough time to create characters the we could care for. The movie does not live up to the hype of the first one, and being a movie of blockbuster status, it should appeal to all audiences and not just the fans who read all the books.I hope the decision to split the final book into two films will help us understand fully about the revolution and the role Katniss plays in it, and increase our interest in the main characters.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Hungry For More,"My favorite thing to do in my free time is watch a good movie. Every Saturday night my family likes to rent or go out to watch a movie.

I like movies that seem realistic even if there's no way in the world that can happen. That's why I was so excited to go watch The Hunger Games: Catching Fire.Recently, a novel created by Suzanne Collins became a motion picture film that has been watched by millions.

Like many people, I was excited to watch The Hunger Games: Catching Fire after watching first Hunger Games movie.Watching the trailer for the second movie, Catching Fire, I was thrilled to know it was coming out very soon and looking as interesting as the last one. I was also hoping some of my questions I had after watching the first movie would be answered in the upcoming film, which they were. I have not read any of the books, so I was unable to make any connections, between the movies and the books. My younger sister has and she mentioned that Catching Fire was based on a lot of parts from the book, and that it was amazing how similar it was to the book, having said that those who enjoyed reading the book will most likely enjoy watching the movie.What I enjoyed about Catching Fire was that it was a continuance of the first film and it didn't confuse the audience on what was going on, like other movies with sequence do. They were many emotional and action scenes, but I was just expecting more. I strongly recommend watching the first Hunger Games before watching Catching Fire, because the audience will be unable to follow what is going on in Catching Fire if they don't. I really enjoy when movies use the same characters they had in the first film in their second one as well, and that's exactly what Catching Fire did, except for those who died, obviously. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire did reminisce a lot on what happened in the past movie, especially to certain characters,which allows the audience to know what the motivations of the characters are. The acting was great and very realistic, not like other films where it seems like actors are reading off cue cards. They incorporated a lot of well-known actors like Liam Hemsworth, Jennifer Lawrence, and Josh Hucherson, which made it more fun to watch. Especially since Liam Hemsworth is such a good looking guy. I suggest if the audience love watching those actors in other movies they should definitely come and watch Catching Fire. Even though the movie was pretty long, it keeps the audience attention the whole time. I was on the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next. I appreciated the hard work that was obviously put into this movie. The audience gets a deeper understanding of the characters in Catching Fire and they show them a different side of the characters. They did add a little humor throughout the film, which made the viewer's laugh a bit. Catching Fire had mostly everything a movie could have; action, drama,romance, and death. Movies are created to entertain people and this one certainly did. My favorite part would have to be the ending, which is left off with a jaw dropping event, leaving the audience anxious for the next one. I did hear many are disappointed by this ending,including my older sister, which made her dislike the entire movie. If you don't like cliff hangers then I recommend that maybe you should wait until the next movie comes out.Opening weekend made about $158,074,286, and I am not ashamed to admit my $10 contributed to that amount of money that was made. It makes you think if so many people are watching this film why shouldn't I go? I am a huge fan of The Hunger Games and I have to say the movies are getting better and better through time. If you haven't seen either of The Hunger Games you are missing out. I HIGHLY recommend The Hunger Games: Catching Fire for any age group, even though the film is PG-13, go drag your parents to go watch it with you if you're under thirteen. I am 90% sure you will enjoy this film. It's a perfect film to go watch when you need to relax and get your mind off things. This movie will not disappoint you!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Remember who the Real Enemy is,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's quite clear I am not the target audience for Suzanne Collins' literary trilogy or the corresponding movies that are packing in the teenagers and young adults. Still, I'll admit to enjoying the first movie ... and being even a bit more impressed by this second entry. Having a female heroine that is young, strong, smart, loyal, and emotionally grounded is not just unusual, but also quite a welcome change of pace.Any uproar over missing/adapted elements from the source books can be chalked up to the young readers who haven't yet come to understand that a 2 hour movie cannot possibly relay all the details and imagination held within the written page. In fact, co-screenwriters Simon Beaufoy (Slumdog Millionaire) and Michael deBrauyn (aka Michael Arndt of Toy Story 3 fame) do an excellent job of balancing the numerous elements contained within the story: a fascist government, the off-kilter romances, family bonds, and the early stages of a revolution/uprising. This sequel features a new and much better suited director in Francis Lawrence, known for I Am Legend.What really makes this material click on screen is the performance of Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss. Her Mockingjay becomes the symbol of hope for the many districts intimidated by the iron fist rule of the President, played by the menacing Donald Sutherland. Ms. Lawrence is an absurdly talented actress and is one of the rare few who can convey a multitude of emotions through facial expressions alone. Despite her prickly personality, the audience connects with her in a most positive manner.In addition to Ms. Lawrence and Mr. Sutherland, returning to the fold are Josh Hutcherson as Peeta (still lacking even an ounce of screen presence), Woody Harrelson as Haymitch (giving a bit more effort this time around), Lenny Kravitz as Cinna, Paula Malcomson as Katniss' mother (seen recently as Abby in ""Ray Donovan""), Willow Shields as Prim, Liam Hemsworth as Gale (his most exciting scene is washing his hands), and of course the instant electricity and energy provided by Elizabeth Banks as Effie and Stanley Tucci as Caesar - two of the most colorful characters this side of 1970's era Elton John.New to this chapter are two of the finest actors working today: Philip Seymour Hoffman as game designer Plutarch Heavensbee, and Jeffrey Wright as ""Volts"" from the ""nuts and volts"" duo with Amanda Plummer. Jena Malone tries, but is miscast as Johanna, and Sam Claflin has a couple of worthy moments as Finnick. Two of the best additions are the frightening killer baboons and the Black Swan-style wedding dress. Both make eye-opening entries.There is much to like about this series thus far, but of course, one must accept it for the genre it represents. And fair warning - see the two Hunger Games movies in order ... or don't bother. Regardless of your take on this franchise - may the odds be ever in your favor.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Slow, but a book in words.","I am in no way a great movie critic, but here goes something:Starting with the only two negatives I can find about this film, the first being the belabored attempt to establish everything the first film/book contained including the alarmingly long 'introduction phase' to the actual novel hard to explain in film whilst being entertaining at times, and secondly a specific act by one of the characters I cannot mention without spoiling the film ridiculous and out of place with the feeling of the film I believe an attempt at humor,the film gripped me emotionally in all the right places. Portrayal of feelings felt only in words in the novel were portrayed so well by Jennifer Lawrence you could have sworn she wrote the novel herself. Slight variations introduced to portray what couldn't be said in words were just enough to not compromise the story and the special effects were top notch to say the least.I was left with feeling of utter immersion into the story, both surreal and involved at all times. Rating the effect of the slow start on the overall enjoyment and the minor added incident with one character, I give this film an eight out of ten, as all other aspects of the film I felt were of the highest standard.Hope I made some good points, first review.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"No, this doesn't quite 'catch fire', but it is a solid piece of dystopian-set action film-making","How much you like ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" will depend heavily on whether you took to the first film - that is to say, if you did not, then you will curse having to sit through two hours or so here of what is essentially the same content retreated, if not entirely rerun. As far as I can care enough to ascertain, there are two major differences between this entry and its 2012 predecessor: firstly, the fighting arena has changed and now consists of a strange clock-like locality wherein various threats to all are triggered at specific times in order to make the contest a little more interesting; and secondly, the fighters involved are all former champions, so the stakes and intensity are increased.For the totally uninitiated, ""The Hunger Games"" unfolds in a cruel English-speaking autocracy which consists of various districts in what is either the far future or a parallel universe. The society prides itself on a kind of faux-patriotism, or po-faced ideas linked to national identity, which are connected to unparalleled honour to the state and its premier as well as its militaristic history and seemed to come out best (or worst) in various Communist societies throughout history: think Cuba or North Korea. At the peak of its powers, the Soviet Union was probably one of the most patriotic nations on Earth. The eponymous Games are a yearly contest whereby a male and a female between the ages of 12 and 18 are selected at random from the aforementioned districts to fight until only one remains - is entwined with the essence of the characteristics that are meant to make up the core of the nation's citizens by Coriolanus Snow (Donald Sutherland), its President.Having been the one to have survived the slog of going through with this in the first film, the conspicuously named Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) lives a life in her village not too detached to that of what she would be doing anyway prior to the first film's events, but with this new-found (and thoroughly unwanted) stardom. Living it with her is Peeta, played by Josh Hutcherson, whose importance in Everdeen's life is that they were essentially 'joint' victors in the last edition after having come to resist duelling to the death and therefore disobeying the State's wishes. But whatever - they live because the twist made for great TV.Central to the previous film was the notion of what constitutes entertainment, and what violence does to a society and a person when it is compartmentalised for amusement or pleasure. In 1998's ""Small Soldiers"", a slimy business executive in charge of marketing action figure toys, whose sole purpose was to beat seven-shades out of one another, dodged the accusation that they were imparting the wrong ideas into the minds of the children that would play with them by pointing out that ""...it's not violence, it's action."" In Snow's world, a population's interest in the hunger games resemble the hordes' interest in our own for the latest smash-'em-up blockbuster or war themed video game. When it seems evident Snow can utilise the friendship Peeta and Katniss have for one another to burnish his own status, he realises he can keep a population in check and quell a rebellion - not unlike how reality TV and soap operas make for both quaint distractions and politically charged opportunities to force the average joe into thinking there's something wrong with them if they don't agree with the mainstream.It's not that Peeta doesn't like Katniss - for someone living under the leaden skies of a North American dictatorship in relative poverty, she's not unattractive. He thinks she's ""stubborn"", but ""good with a bow"" - in her own opinion, she ""isn't very good at friends."" Very little of this actually matters by the end, though - the film isn't really a character study, it's an action film attempting allegory which is probably a little too long. Did any of these things change in Katniss by the end? Not really, and we are not granted satisfying closure anyway due to the need to tee up a third entry, which is handles clumsily.Before all that are the special 75h edition of the Hunger Games, which pits all the previous winners from other villages/divisions against one another in a great big battle royal set in an enclosed jungle space housing its own biodiversity; special power up 'drops' and a set of weaponry befitting to the skills of its competitors. The event is, in truth, an opportunity for the establishment to knock-off the troublesome lovebirds, who are doing more to foment unrest than sooth it, and replace them with a new 'couple' who will act as the great metaphor for the stability of the regime. For the film, it allows itself permission to cynically bring together proven battle hardened champions to face off with one another, essentially permitting more action and fighting than if the competitors were newbies with no clue as to what to do.This particular entry is not without merit, but it lacks something special for it to be anything more than what it is - a moderate actioner. Curiously, I did not feel for the characters involved in the same way that I did in the first film, and the actual 'games' themselves feel oddly synthetic, even incidental, where before they felt first like a brooding event and then then became a gruelling catharsis. The film handles the supposed tension between Snow's regime and the rest of the population quite well, without really presenting to us any of the large-scale uprisings that we're supposed to feel are endemic - this is achieved through Sutherland's acting more than anything, but you genuinely sense a political wrestling match is unfolding out there somewhere. When all is said and done, a dislike of the first film will probably lead to a positive hatred of this one. Enjoy the first, and you will gleam plenty from the continuation of the story here.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"A good sequel, just too long.","THE HUNGER GAMES: CATCHING FIREThis is part 2 of the Hunger Games movies, so that automatically usually means that it will not be as good as the first one. It is very rare that a sequel is better then the original...The movie continues on from the original movie... Katniss and Peeta won the last Hunger Games and they are about to go on a tour of the Districts. There is a rebellion against the politicians and the games, so the president decides that Katniss must die as she is the person the rebellion has chosen to be their leader. The next games would be different. The participants are previous champions. Katniss and Peeta are going back in. Will they survive again? The thing I liked about this too is there are some people they can trust but some they can't... It is very good watching this wondering if the people they are talking too are trustworthy. It keeps you guessing.The main thing I felt about this movie was it was too long. It is on for about 2 and a half hours which is not normally a problem, but the first hour of this film really dragged out. My favourite part of these film are the games themselves, but the games do not begin until roughly 75 minutes into the film. The first half of the movie i felt could have been shorter.The film is very good. I enjoyed it a lot and I liked the new idea of the battle ground. It is set in a different place this time and I loved the twists that presented themselves throughout the movie. It seems they are not just trying to survive against the other contestants... they have other problems to deal with too.The casting was again very good. As far as I could tell, everyone from the original movie returned for the sequel with a few new faces. Jennifer Lawrence﻿ played Katniss. Jennifer was very good in this movie again. SHe is a very talented actress and I can see her in a lot of movies in the future. Josh Hutcherson﻿ played Peeta. I thought that Josh did a great job too. I really feel sorry for his character. He clearly loves Katniss a lot and will do anything to protect her, but she does not seem to have the same feelings, but she will protect him from anything. It is a weird relationship. haha Other cast members that did a fantastic job were Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland and the late, great Philip Seymour Hoffman.It will be very interesting what they do with Philip's character as he still had one more scene to shoot for the next movie. I hope they don't replace him or make a mistake with the character.The violence was again very good in this film. Some scenes were harsh but still very well done. This is a dark movie.I will give this film 7 out of 10.""Remember who the real enemy is.""For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"More Confident, More Polished, and Much Improved","After seeing The Hunger Games, I wanted desperately to see the sequel, Catching Fire. There was so much potential for the franchise after the first film, and as I liked Catching Fire better than the first novel, I had high hopes. When I heard Lionsgate had replaced Gary Ross with a new director, Francis Lawrence, I was even more excited for this film. In my mind, a new director was just what this franchise needed.I'll start with the script and story, as their quality was largely unaltered from the first film. Even though the series's author Suzanne Collins would not stay on to write the script for Catching Fire, it largely stayed true to the novel. The largest changes mainly highlighted the political undertones of the series in a good way, bringing the Games out to be a more political statement than perhaps Collins wanted. However, these moments between Plutarch Heavensbee and President Snow added a lot of thematic depth and really made the film all that much better. They better explained the motivations of President Snow and kept us guessing about Plutarch and what his actual motivations were. Also, these scenes along with several others make it clear that the film's message is one of overthrowing the oppression of tyranny, making a more coherent film throughout. Overall, the changes made to the script of Catching Fire enhanced, not detracted, from Collins's original work.Visually, Catching Fire has improved from the first film. In the story, the Capitol has spared no expense on the 75th Hunger Games; likewise, the visuals feel and look more extravagant and special. Many times, we are reminded of this fact: many scenes from the arena take descriptions from Collins's book and bring them to life in a magnificent way. This is truly a visual masterpiece, even for its seeming lack of special effects, as it brings Collins's world to life in incredibly vibrant ways.The acting of Catching Fire is much improved from its predecessor. Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson feel more confident in their lead roles of Katniss and Peeta, respectively, while the characters that were truly stellar in the first film are given more of an opportunity to shine. Haymitch and Effie both are given the time needed to be considered major supporting roles, allowing Woody Harrelson and Elizabeth Banks to excel in their respective roles. The additions to the cast perform admirably as well, especially Philip Seymour Hoffman as Plutarch. He makes us keep guessing about where his character's allegiances lie until the end, just as his character does in the book. Donald Sutherland is another highlight, as he makes us want to hate President Snow with a passion. Overall, a solid group of actors produces a solid group of performances that seem straight out of the novel.The direction of Catching Fire is arguably the greatest improvement of the film. Francis Lawrence is unafraid to take the reigns and show us how a no-name director can make a splash. He ditches the shaky camera-work of Gary Ross and replaces it with smooth, steady shots from mounted cameras. This is a marked improvement in many of the more exciting scenes, as they seem more coherent on screen. The use of IMAX cameras in the arena also helps us further distinguish it as its own world from the rest of Panem. However, the best part of the cinematography is that it remains very personal, despite it not being hand-held. This makes it never be missed and gives a more polished look to the film.Overall, Catching Fire is a marked improvement over its predecessor. It feels more confident and more polished as a whole, and this extra shine makes it a much more enjoyable film and a better one. This film would probably be placed in my top 20 overall. It's that good. There's not a single bad component to this film. Some things could be better, but they're so small you'll hardly notice. A fine job by the cast and crew to make Catching Fire a very, very good film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
The Rebellion Begins,"The aim, the stare, the fire, the start of the destruction of Panem is growing dimmer and weaker by the minute, by the hour – all because one girl, one simple but head-stronged girl – who thought she was saving herself along with the boy next door, but all she did was defied the very existence of survival, defied the very existence living.We are now on the verge of the strongest revolts against the Capitol. We are about to embark the end of the beginning. The Hunger Games were just games but the Quarter Quell outdid every aspect of the way we saw the original games. But we are about see the awakening unfold between a ruthless dictator in President Snow and a girl, ""the girl on fire"", but this war goes beyond them – it goes all the way back to surviving freedom.The cast was on the A – game – Jennifer Lawrence (J-Law) in one word – INCREDIBLE!!!! Josh Hutcherson – insanely incredible. Liam Hemsworth – freaking awesome. The rest of the cast and crew, you guys were really awesome, but the props has to go to my favorite 2 actors – the antagonist Donald Sutherland, you are the epitome of evil – you are an incredible actor; and Phillip Seymour Hoffman – kudos goes to you, you brought the position of gamemaker to a whole new level.Suzanne Collins – you are an incredible author, you gave us something to believe in and for that we thank you for allowing us to dive into your world. Thank you.Francis Lawrence – you are an incredible director and I can't wait to see what you have planned for Parts 1 & 2 of Mockingjay.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Every Revolution Begins With A Spark,"The second chapter of The Hunger Games series continues the journey of Katniss Everdeen & although it presents quite an improvement over its predecessor, it still couldn't avoid the typical trappings of its genre that stopped it from being a great sequel. Katniss & Peeta being crowned the winner of the 74th Hunger Games ended up starting an uprising against the Capitol because of which Snow himself wants them to put everything to rest during the victory tour. But when things go opposite as planned, Snow changes the rules of the games on its 75th anniversary to bring other tributes into a single game in which only one could emerge a winner, thus bringing back Katniss & Peeta to compete once again.What improves compared to the previous film is clearly visible in the film's themes & tone, which are explored in more detail here. The visual effects are also better due to more budget, the production design team has done a fine job despite few missteps here n there & the reprising cast has played their characters with more maturity this time. Leading from the front is Jennifer Lawrence once again who turns out to be the best thing in the film & steals the show for the second time in a row as the Girl on Fire. What's also nice to see is a character arc for Katniss at last in the script, something which was very much missing in the last film. Francis Lawrence's direction is pretty energetic but the film still ends up running longer than it should have.Things not working in favour of Catching Fire is its stale characters. Apart from Katniss, there is no one really who we care about & most of the new cast doesn't even get a proper introduction. The costumes & makeup remain cartoony like the previous film. Editing surely leaves out many moments that could've been trimmed. And just like its predecessor, Catching Fire takes too much time before we get to see the games plus the ending also could've been a better chosen one. Still, on an overall scale, where most sequels crash & burn, Catching Fire burns bright & shiny and is a more polished & robust sequel and is arguably as refreshingly entertaining, if not more, as The Hunger Games.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
probably my favorite of all the films,"Francis Lawrence was somehow the best (or just a right) choice for this installment of the Hunger Games series - and it seems like he did a good enough job that the producers gave him the two parter of Mockingjay - and yet it is easy to see from I am Legend. Not a flawless film, but it showed a director who knew how to put someone we care about as an audience almost inherently (Will Smith, Jennifer Lawrence) in harms way of some really f***ed up scenarios. What's different from that film to this one is that the source material isn't changed around to fit something else, it's just kept to what the book was and how strong the story and action set pieces got underway. In other words, it's loaded with superbly staged action, characters that get fleshed out more than before (both heroes and villains and one that may be in-between), and the politics of it is striking. Yes, for a blockbuster like this it can get political.Catching Fire picks up a little while after the first Hunger Games ends when Katniss and Peeta won the game (yep, both of them, one of those last-minute things/twists but it worked). What sets this off well is a scene early one where Katniss is called in to the office of President Snow (Sutherland). It's still one of those scenes you remember well from this series, where it's all about intimidation, where Snow doesn't ask but tells Katniss she must act a certain way with Peeta on camera to ""convince"" the romantic angle, or there will be consequences (the way Sutherland responds to Katniss' ""I'll convince him"" with ""No, convince *me*"" is as sinister as acting can get). So the first part is watching Katniss and Peeta having to still put on a front of things to the world watching the winners, but also seeing how absolutely awful things are for people in the districts. And yet it doesn't seem that far off from something that could be seen in the real world: say, a badly-off urban area, or a militarized city, surrounded in fear and intimidation (except when there's rebellion, in some small and big gestures).All through this first part Lawrence is still acting in ways thats more about responding to people with looks, or downplaying what could be bigger emotions from any other actress. This works since she needs to save the BIG stuff once the story takes the major turn (though not something people will see as unpredictable due to the nature of sequels): there's an ANNIVERSARY hunger games planned, and it involves the past winners in a drawing... so Katniss is back in! It's from here that we get a sort of Hunger Games part TWO in the sense of seeing the games all over again and of course the thought is how they can do what they did in the first film better or different. What's surprising is if there was any thought that Lawrence couldn't direct this to top Gary Ross - it certainly wasn't difficult from a filmmaking stand-point.By this I mean that unlike the first movie, which was really an R-rated action movie edited down to PG-13 in a matter of how the cuts were jagged and unsettling (and not in any effective way), Catching Fire delivers really shocking action beats and moments of brutality, but nothing seems like it is cut or shot in a way that is disorientating or shot in a way that is 'off'. Lawrence gets these actors from one place to the next and yet finds time for people to sit down and have good talk. There's also the trap that could be easily fallen in to in a translation of this material, which is much smarter and sharper than the average YA lit of today but has the potential to slip into s***, but Lawrence and Hutcherson work really well off one another this time, and the additions of actors like Jena Malone and Jeffrey Wright take things up a notch: you believe these people more as people than should almost be conceivable for a genre piece.The other great addition here is Phillip Seymour Hoffman. He plays Plutarch, a new game-maker chief (ok, not the most subtle name, but then how about Peeta or Snow). Like Sutherland he relishes in under-playing things at times, just delivering a look says enough than having to say extra things, but at the same time his presence as this guy who seems TOO smart in some ways, how he talks up things to Snow, makes him the most welcome addition in the film. It's actors like him and the others brought over from the first movie that sets this apart from other movies.There's high velocity thrills and kills, and you get some crazy special effects and even (yes) monsters (I still remember leeches at one point being a major threat in a mud pool or something). But it all comes back to the characters and the stakes in the time-frame for them, and most of all about the IMAGE that's presented. There's satire here, not really buried but on the contrary fully present and out there. In a way its obviousness is part of why it's kind of brilliant (if not like all-time great or anything, it's still got some sappy moments and a cliffhanger that is both devastating and kind of over the top); you know it's right here in society, but it's taken to another level in a way that takes from other science fiction stories in a fresh way.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Sequel=Original,"First off, I'm going to review the film, not the book seeing as how this is a film page discussing the merit of a movie, not a book written for children.As far as doing a sequel to the Hunger Games, it is a money grab. However, in sequence this film expands on the original and defines the conflict between the protagonists and the antagonists fairly well. The actors in the film seem engaged and poised to allow the characters to somewhat ""buy in"" to the story and presentation of Katniss and Peeta's journey into the new year of the games. The script and screenplay aren't overly complex, but they do a fair job of not bogging down the action with overstated themes or subsequent plot lines. The focus seems drawn on the main character, which is, to an extent, a good choice. Katniss as the ""chosen one"" heron is overly used in the Hollywood hack circuit, but hey, most people don't mind formulas given the films blockbuster success.The original film was not overly impressive. It was successful because a lot of people watched it, and it was based on a popular book at the time, but it wasn't a cinema masterpiece. The build and suspense written into the actual games in the original was unimpressive and the followup does a better job at building intensity and suspense. In that way the sequel surpasses the original. The tone of the film is less bland than the original even if some of this films most heartfelt moments felt like I was at a High School dance, which is authentic and meaningful, if you can somehow separate the gush from the fact that in the Hunger Games world people are being flogged and executed daily. The Hunger Games and Catching Fire both suffer from in my opinion the same issue. The stakes are minimal if the conflict between the have and have not's in the film aren't overstated. Katniss may be the lead, but certainly in can be made clear that she is but a conduit for the undercurrent of political duress of the masses being oppressed by a monarchy who is punishing and cold. The distance between those two sides, and the creation of that division is how the film has built any sort of credence with general audiences. However, did they go far enough? Did they put enough in front of you to really hate the opposition? Have they convinced the audience that Katniss and her district folk are really suffering? The answer to me, is no, they didn't push far enough. The story is good, but not great, because dramatically they haven't extended themselves to really convince viewers that this is a matter of life and death.I felt content with this film and don't hate that I put money in Hollywood's pocket. They took a pretty average product, polished it, pumped some needed cash flow into it, and then sent it out in the cold of Thanksgiving, leaving no trace of any other noteworthy films who didn't want to get caught in a tussle with Hunger Games.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
it is simply amazing,"I really love the movie, it is so close to the story yet so different, the actors all have added a touch to the characters in a way you do not read in the story which makes it a great experience.The graphics was amazing, Jennifer Lawrence gave Katniss the strength we missed in the novel plus lets face the facts.. she is really sexy :)Now the reason I did not give it 10 out of 10 is not really because of the film it self, it is rather things that I wish it will be considered in the third movie, first, I would prefer to sense more evil from Donald Sutherland; he played President Snow perfectly and was pleasant to see on the screen, yet, I don't believe he was evil enough, maybe more anger will help. Also I would love to see Woody Harrelson more drunk and more active, he also did an excellent role as Haymitch, the mentor and the friend, yet, he was not drunk enough in the movie, he had a bigger role on the story and did a better acting on the first movie, there were also a very very bad acting scene during the first 15 minutes in which Katniss through water at him, his reaction was really bad and did not sell it. let us not forget that his role on Mockingjay will be huge. Finally, I would have loved to see more from Cinna, we barely see him, although the character is really important all through the novel, I do understand that even on the novel, his character does not appear much, but it is mentioned so many times in Katniss thoughts.In general, it is a movie that I will watch over and over and over again, I loved it and cannot wait to Mockingjay to be released :)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

Worth every cent and more!,"I have to admit, I had low expectations of this movie when I saw the trailer. I liked the original but I thought it was mediocre and, dare I say, low budget. I thought everything was dull and confusing. However, this turned my opinion of the series on its head. A MAJOR step up from the first Hunger Games! Everything was well written and acted. The motives were clear as a bell and blazing like fire. Jennifer Lawrence deserves to get an Oscar for this performance because it was jaw-dropping and inspiring. She portrayed strength and defiance for what it was. The rest of the actors played wonderfully as well. The emotions were high up and provoking to the audience, bringing someone like me to tears. Added to the thrilling action sequences, this movie was worth every cent. I will gladly pay to see it again in theatres!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
A step down from the original,"It is a clear step down from the original, there are plenty of plot holes and the dialogue and acting is worse than the original. But there are still a lot of great things about this film. The ending is great, it's much more creative in the games, and the side characters are much more thought out.A great film but not close to the original.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
wurst movie ending ever!,"This is a movie made for money profit only. First one was made with passion and believe to make a good movie and thats the only reason why people actually went to see the second movie. Unfortunately, the story is rather boring and similar to the first movie. Not much happens, when you think the movie is going to start or really reveal some story they just end it mid scene. It was a true pain to the eye if you dare to be honest and not react in a way like well everyone says it was good so I think alike. I strongly recommend not to go see this in theater and wait for the last one in the hope they don't screw that over as well. Sure, we know it was going to end in an open ending but this movie does not follow the structure every book or movie should have, beginning, middle, plot/end scene. This is a good movie to watch on a lazy afternoon with you brain capacity on half speed.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
A loyal adaption of the book,"I am a recently fan of Hunger Games books, I read Catching Fire 3 months ago. And wow such as the book, the movie is very amazing, spectacular and specially loyal. As in the book I liked the first part, it is an essential introduction for the people who didn't see the movie. Almost every important details were in the movie but some important were missing, but the major ideas were here. I felt that the movie was so fast, maybe it's because they are more details in the book and I payed attention to what there were or not. Catching Fire is different of the first one, the movie is more dark and mature, especially you'll see the difference in the direction because of the budget increases. I liked that we felt all kind of feelings: joy, sadness, fear, impatience, there are also beautiful sequences full of emotions. If you had read the book you will definitely enjoy Catching Fire.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Hungry for more?,"http://www.yusufpoonawala.com/movie/the-hunger-games-catching-fire/Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence reprises her role of Katniss Everdeen in this post apocalyptic sequel to the 2012 Hunger Games trilogy, written by Suzanne Collins.Directed by I am Legend and Water for Elephants director, Francis Lawrence, who has also been finalised for the directing the remaining 2 sequels, Mockingjay 1 & 2, the film has screenplay by Simon Beaufoy and Michael deBruyn.Josh Hutcherson (Journey to the Centre of the Earth) and Liam Hemsworth continue their roles of Peeta & Gale respectively.The story resumes with the winning tributes of the 74th Hunger Games, Peeta & Katniss about to start their victory tour amongst the 12 Districts. President Snow (Donald Sutherland) visits Katniss at her residence and threatens her to convince the Districts about her love for Peeta, in order to suppress a rebellion, inspired by the suicide threat by Peeta and her in the Hunger Games.Along the way, Snow announces the 75th Hunger Games which also is Panem's third Quarter Quell, a special edition of the game, held every 25 years, wherein the past winners have to participate. Here begins another round of guidance by Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), competition and alliances with the other tributes, Jeffrey Wright, Sam Clafflin etc and a new game maker, Plutarch Heavensbee (Phillip Seymour Hoffman).The film does tend to drag in places, both before the games, but I guess the makers wanted to take their time to build the plot, but somehow it still feels that...dragging. The love triangle, becomes more prominent here, with KatnissRest, the film has its moments once the games are announced. Full marks to the team for creating the world of Panem, of despondency and excess, beautifully shown vide a drink consumed by the people in the Capitol, so it can make them sick, in order to have more food again!Jennifer Lawrence is more at ease here than the first installment. Woody is a treat as the alcoholic mentor. Sutherland always is at his best in a negative role. It is Hoffman who provides the twists in the plot along with his flair.Lets not forget good ol' spicy Stanley Tucci, who revs up the screen with his pearly whites. In terms of character developments, the real progress or change is only in the heart of Katniss, leading to the buildup of the love triangle for the grand finale....where am sure true love will conquer all.The film ends on an interesting twist, sure to create the buzz for the 3rd book, Mockingjay which is being made into 2 parts, a la Potter.Background score by James Newton Howard, cinematography by Jo Willems makes this a more interesting film to watch than the original, in my case.Does it have The Y Factor : YesRating : 3.5 / 5",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
and the cracks start to form,"And already now the franchise seem to fall apart a bit. While Catching Fire has some better elements than its predecessor, fixing some of my complaints, it starts to add a lot more problems since it's a franchise movie. Not enough time with characters or enough explanation to why character are like they are, and the Hunger Game here is really just a side gig to the new plot, revolution. Some aspects work, while some really don't. I feel like this franchise really got worse from here on, because they don't stand on their own feet as good movies on their own. The first Hunger Games will forever stand on its own while this one is good, it will have symptoms of the middle child.After her winning of the Hunger Games, a new rebellion is starting. President Snow notices the fans of Katniss and sends her back to a new Hunger Games.A performance I forgot to highlight last time was Stanley Tucci as Caesar. He brings so much late night host energy to his role and is no doubt the biggest joy here. The performances are not nearly as great as the first movie and seems more leaned back here. The focus on romance is not helping it, as we didn't spend enough time with the characters in the first movie. A problem that carries over to this movie with a vengeance. Characters are barley here and deaths doesn't hit at all. Sure characters like Finnick add a little, but I felt nothing for these contestants at all.The movie is centered around the revolution aspect more and therefore the Hunger game is not that interesting here. It is showed more to the side with too many alliances and too much interference from the game master. It really makes the movie feel less grand than the original. I will never understand why Katniss turns into this symbol of the rebellion. She barely does anything special in her Hunger Game and after what 75 years? They decide that the capital is evil? I don't understand why Katniss inspires people in this franchiseSpeaking of Katniss, she looks so weird in this movie! The make-up looks horrendous, and I think this is the only movie where she looks like that. She looks overly dolly in this movie, and it really didn't click with me.The action and the overall shots are so much better directed here. But it also removes something to talk about in terms of the camerawork. The camerawork is just boring now, nothing to really talk about at all, and it feels more stale. Some of the traps are a bit more intense than the original, and I kind of liked that, but this movie is a bit more about the traps than the Hunger Games contestants.This movie uses more time on the romance than the original, but we barely got to know the love interests in the first movie, so it's not really anything worth talking about or adds anything of value.This time around, I find the first half better than the last half, contrary to the original. I wanted the first movie to just start, but the political undertones here are far more interesting than anything going on in the Hunger Game.This is still a fine enough movie and I see it as enjoyable enough and more or less on par with the original. But the original feels more like its own movie and a stand alone, while this one feels like a set-up movie for something bigger. It's a weakness for it, and it will lead to some terrible and mid-movies, but this one is still fine. I see it as a bit more soulless though.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
A worthy middle chapter in a surprisingly mature teen franchise.,"It is has been over a year now since the first ""The Hunger Games"" took the box office (and audiences) by storm. Now after much anticipation, well marketed hype, and a year of below par sequels (mostly); ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" is finally here. So is the verdict. And the verdict is very glowing indeed.""Catching Fire"" is all about the consequences of Katniss' victory in the last Hunger Games. She tricked the Capitol and President Snow wants revenge. So while she tries to appease President Snow she must also deal with the fact that she is the reluctant symbol of a rebellion beginning to emerge in the Districts. Things get even worse for her as she must decide how she will keep her loved ones safe as the next Hunger Games come closer, and these Games will have a twist that will change things forever.The sequel does a fantastic job of diving deeper into the thought-provoking ideas of the books. We find deeper themes concerning totalitarian government, the one percent versus the ninety-nine percent, violence in our media, and beginnings of war. It is based off of a young adult novel but it is much smarter than your average teen story.All of this is mainly due to the wonderful new direction the film was taken into by Francis Lawrence (new director). While I did enjoy the controversial shaky-camera of ""The Hunger Games"" I will admit there is something refreshing to get a clear look at the action this time around. However, Lawrence was smart because he kept the dark tone set by Gary Ross in the original and he even expanded upon it. Usually there is fear of a change in directors so suddenly can lead to jarring tonal shifts with films in a series. However, Lawrence did an excellent job of making the film his own while building off of the world we had seen in the first movie.While Lawrence did add something new and exciting to the series, the fact is ""Catching Fire"" would fail if it was not for the fantastic actress that was placed in the lead. At this point it is cliché to say that Jennifer Lawrence is fantastic but it is very true. From the very first shot of the film she has you trapped in her gaze. Her down-to-earth persona makes Katniss very relatable. Also, Jennifer made the smart move to show the thing in Katniss that makes her relatable to almost everybody, the desire to protect her family and loved ones. They could not have found a better actress to portray the endearment, strength, love, and vulnerability that is Katniss Everdeen.Of course the rest of the cast do fantastic jobs as well. Josh Hutcherson portrays Peeta's broken heart with finesse as well as the strength (and even pain) he has gained from being in the Hunger Games before. Liam Hemsworth gets more screen time this time around and he does a great job with it. We know Gale loves Katniss (but also confused on how to deal with this situation) and this time that is explored more in depth which is a nice focus. Then of course there is Woody Harrelson, Lenny Kravits, Elizabeth Banks, Donald Sutherland, and new cast members; Jena Malone, Sam Claflin, and Philip Seymour Hoffman who all do fantastic jobs. It is hard to find such a reliable cast in a brand new movie series.One final note concerns the love story in the film. While the love story is not the primary focus of the series I am happy to see it get more time to expand in this movie. The chemistry between Lawrence/Hutcherson and Lawrence/Hemsworth is clearly much more distinguishable in this movie. We see a teenage girl who is in the middle of a revolution while dealing with normal teenage girl problems in her home. And I am happy that the filmmakers were careful in their portrayal of the love story and did not make it feel forced or cheesy. The chemistry and the story itself did all the work.All-in-all, this is a very fine addition to what is probably one of the smartest franchises to come out in a long time. With fantastic performances, great direction and writing, intense action sequences, and a deeper sense of the thought-provoking themes from the novel; ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" soars above and beyond expectations to set the stage for the two-part final act to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Been there done that...,"For a start: I liked the first movie. I didn't love it as other people did, but I certainly enjoyed watching it. This is the kind of movies I like to see in cinema and lose myself in the movie for 2,5 hours. So I went to the second Hunger Games with not too big expectations, but was certainly looking forward to it.Let's make clear I've been rarely so bored in cinema. At a certain point I told my friend I was almost falling asleep, he checked his watch and saw the movie was going on for almost 90 minutes already and nothing mentionable happened! The first 90% of the movie is almost the same as the first movie, which was cool the first time but not interesting at all the second time. There are elections, there's a train ride to the capitol, she gets a dress that lights on fire when she spins, they enter in a chariot both on fire and the action in the games was almost the same (which supposed to be a special this time since it was the 75th anniversary). It was horrible to see almost exactly the same for over 2 hours. Besides that, the emotions didn't get to me. Was I supposed to care about her love-life, about district 12? I didn't, while I did care about little Rue dying in part 1. So emotion wise, the first was better in my opinion. Another thing that annoyed me was how predictable it was, nothing surprised or shocked me. I won't spoil anything, but there's not much to spoil except for the end. My advise would be to only watch the last 30 minutes of the movie, those were okayish and give me hope for a better third part. Last but not least, the CGI was not so good, I won't overreact it was okay, but from a movie this popular I expect top notch, and it wasn't.Since I have a subscription to the cinema, it wasn't a waste of money. But it sure was a horrible waste of time. The best part of the movie was the trailer of The Hobbit 2. I like to go to great movies for a second or third time in cinema. The idea of having to watch this movie a second time gives me a headache.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Very much feels like 'THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK' of the series!,"'THE HUNGER GAMES: CATCHING FIRE': Five Stars (Out of Five)The sequel to the 2012 blockbuster, based on the book of the same name by Suzanne Collins, about a dystopian future where kids are selected (by a lottery) to compete to the death in a bloody arena, as part of a reality TV show aired for the public to see. Jennifer Lawrence once again stars as Katniss Everdeen and Josh Hutcherson plays Peeta Mellark, the two survivors of the games in the first film. They've now inspired the beginnings of a rebellion, which scares the powers that be and in retaliation they're once again selected to compete in the 'hunger games', along with other winners from previous years. The film also once again stars Woody Harrelson, Liam Hemsworth, Elizabeth Banks, Lenny Kravitz, Stanley Tucci and Donald Sutherland. They're joined by newcomers like Philip Seymour Hoffman, Sam Claflin, Jeffrey Wright and Jenna Malone. Francis Lawrence (who's previous directing credits include films like 'I AM LEGEND' and 'CONSTANTINE') directed this installment and Simon Beaufoy (who's previous writing credits include movies like 'THE FULL MONTY' and 'SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE') and Michael Arndt (who also wrote 'LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE' and co-wrote films like 'TOY STORY 3', 'BRAVE' and 'OBLIVION') wrote the screenplay. I loved the first movie (it was my second favorite film of last year) and found this installment to be nearly as good. It's also my favorite movie of this year!Katniss (Lawrence) has now become a symbol of hope to the masses and is inspiring rebellions around the world. President Snow (Sutherland) is extremely threatened by this and devises a plan, along with the new head gamemaker (Hoffman), to have the contestants for the 75th Annual Hunger Games selected from previous winners, forcing Katniss and Peeta to reenter the games. Things aren't completely as they seem though as the film builds to a shocking conclusion and cliffhanger. This chapter very much feels like 'THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK' of the series in that way. It's also much darker than the original film and revolves around an evil government retaliating against rebellious forces that caused some damage in the first movie (like 'EMPIRE' as well).Like the first film (and all great science fiction) the movie has a lot of great social commentary with parallels to modern life in the real world. This is one of the areas these films are the strongest at. This one, like the first, also has a lot of great action and spectacular visuals. It wasn't quite as moving as the original movie for me (although it has it's tearful moments) and is a little slower paced (for much of the first half of the film) but the last hour (containing all the scenes in the arena) is action packed and the ending is breathtaking. I thought the romance between Katniss and Peeta, and the love triangle involving Gale (Hemsworth) as well, really worked again and found myself once again really relating to Peeta (as he is the heart of these films). Lawrence is the action hero of the series though and now a full blown movie star. She totally shines in this movie (and has never looked better) and really makes it something worth watching. Like I said I didn't find it quite as enjoyable as the original but it's pretty damn close!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSU_hwOQSWQ",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
The Girl On Fire Burns On,"Let me just start off by saying that I am a HUGE fan of the books, especially Catching Fire. That said, I had high expectations going into the theater, and this movie did not disappoint. One of the things I love about this movie is how true it is to the book. Although obviously not everything from the book made it to the big screen, the scenes that were included made sense and incorporated anything that needed to be incorporated. The screenwriters give you enough information to understand what is going on, but also allow you to figure out certain details for yourself, which is something I immensely enjoyed. The bigger budget and new director made a positive difference, as well.I'll start off by talking about the visuals, especially the scenes in the Capitol. Everything in the Capitol looked so realistic, colorful, and over the top, just as described in the books. The images seemed to pop right off the screen! The stark contrast between the districts and the Capitol were masterfully done, with the colors of the Capitol shocking you after the grays of the districts. I also have to give big kudos to the costume designer. The costumes were amazing, from the simple clothes in the districts to the extravagant costumes of the Capitol. Everything worn by Katniss and Peeta, especially on the victory tour, tells a story, and all the costumes were expertly done with great attention to detail.However great the visuals and aesthetics were in Catching Fire, what really made this movie amazing for me was the acting. This movie is perfectly casted. The returning supporting actors add more depth to their characters. Elizabeth Banks molds Effie into someone more human, and you can really see how much she has come to care about Peeta and Katniss. The new additions are even better. Sam Claflin provides a great portrayal of Finnick, and Jena Malone's performance as Johanna really blew me away. The lead actors also bring more to the table. Josh Hutcherson does a great job as Peeta, giving him more emotional depth than in the first film, and Liam Hemsworth plays a convincing Gale. But the real star of this film is Jennifer Lawrence.Without Jennifer Lawrence, this movie would never be half as good. Katniss is a complex character, with many different levels, and Jennifer expertly brings them to life. Her face portrays everything Katniss is feeling, including both what she is showing the outside world, and what she feels inside. She brings Katniss to life in a way that I never thought possible, showing us every aspect of her character, no matter how small. She portrays Katniss' outward strength, but also her vulnerability and fear, something everyone can relate to. Both Lawrence and Hutcherson bring the complex and fascinating relationship of Peeta and Katniss to life in this film.What every actor in this film has in common is that they all portray every aspect of their character, even the subtle things. In some cases, such as Jena Malone as Johanna, they make their character's feelings on the events of the movie blatantly clear. But in others, such as Stanley Tucci as Caesar Flickerman, their eyes just barely hint on their true feelings of their situation and the world around them. Through Caesar's cheerful facade, you can still see that he is afraid of the events going on around him. It may be subtle, but it is there none the less.Overall, this was a fantastic movie. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time, eager for whatever was coming next. This is the kind of movie you just can't get out of your head for days, as you keep replaying the images and conversations in your mind. I will definitely be seeing this movie again! I'm so glad Francis Lawrence will be directing the next two, and I am so excited to see those as well!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Catching Fire: The Bridge to another Episode,"Picking up where the first ""Hunger Games"" film ended, ""Catching Fire"" takes a while to develop. The action does not pick up until the actual game.This ""part 2"" really feels like that's what it is. As a stand alone story, it is lacking, which is why I am downgrading it to a 6.When the warriors get to the battlefield, it really feels like a variation on the TV show ""Survivor"". Alliances are tenuous and changeable. Katniss' love also seems subject to change.But Jennifer Lawrence's acting is the highlight of the film.

Like a Remake...,"Hunger Games: Catching Fire is the second installment in The Hunger Games franchise, and so far, I'm not so excited. The only reason I watch these movies is to get ready for the upcoming one now in November. But about this one. Well, it was just ok. The plot is taking place just after part one, and things are starting to get out of control when Katniss Everdeen is changing the Hunger Games, and starts to make people mad. After that it goes a while and a new Hunger Games is out once again, with the same characters from part one. So honestly, nothing new was changed, just a new game. You know they are going to survive, because it's too predictable. Some new challenges but didn't impress too much. But I have to admit that part two was better made than the original one. The stunts were creative and well done. Great camera-work and epic angles, what gave this an extra cinematic experience. Entertaining for most time, so I give most points for that. They showed a bigger connection between the friend group in the games, but I wished some more character development form the main characters. I also wished they could show more of the world outside, because they haven't showed it so much yet. And the music. Well, The Hunger Games theme is fun to listen, but not for the thousand time. They could put more variety in the music score. The nostalgic and heroic theme was getting my out of control sometimes. But overall, this wasn't such a bad movie. It got some technical and historical problems that I would change, but at the same time it was very entertaining and good action included, with a pretty cool cliffhanger at the end! So if you liked the first one, then you should watch this one, too, but don't have high expectations.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
I was NOT disappointed.,"Naturally, it would be impossible to include every detail and every nuance of the book, but this director worked at incorporating the elements that had the most impact. The awesome special effects brought the book's images to life, and what had to be left out due to time constraints was not that disappointing. A little... but you'll get over it soon enough. I was also very appreciative of the fact this director chose not to use that 'shaky camera' effect which was used in the opening scene of the first movie. That is so annoying. The movie is nearly 2 1/2 hours, but it went so fast that I was left hungry for more. (No pun intended!) The only negative thing I have is that, for some reason, Liam's character, 'Gale' seems to have aged considerably between making the first and second movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Darker and deeper,"The Hunger Games: Catching fire -Better than the 1st part but only by a slight margin. Unlike the 1st part, catching fire concentrates more on Capitol targeting Katniss because she inspired a rebellion in the districts. OK, thats how it goes against a totalitarian government, right?!This one is more darker, exactly how a middle installment should be and the climax revealing a smart twist which drives the franchise into Mockingjay. Waiting for that.Visually, Catching fire is double that of hunger games.While i enjoyed the later part of the movie but didn't get through the lengthy setting for an already established characters. should have been more crisp instead of prolonging Katniss relationship. Of course, that is one of the main subplot but still i don't get the length they gave to the relationship.Jennifer Lawrence getting better day by day.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Excellent adaptation of the book,"Francis Lawrence did an amazing job with this movie. He stayed true to the book. At times it was seamless, as if Gary Ross and Frances Lawrence corroborated together to satisfy fans of the book.Jen, Josh and Liam are great in the 3 main roles. Sam Chaflin and Jena Malone were superb as Finnick and Johanna. Sutherland portrays Snow in such an evil, controlling way. Woody provides comic relief as Haymitch, as does Elizabeth with her outlandish portrayal of Effie. Stanley Tucci as Caesar is just smitten with the whole Katniss/Peeta romance.

I expected a lot more,"When I was reading the Hungergames trilogy, the second book became my absolute favorite due to the amazing characters that were introduced to us. So it's easy to understand that I was really looking forward to the movie.Even though the movie was okay and the acting was even improved a bit since the first movie, I couldn't shake off the feeling that they left out a big part of the story line. Of course, it's understandable that you have to leave some things out since there's not enough time in one movie to film it all. But I can't agree with the fact that the whole 'back-to-district-12' part took about 2/3th of the movie.I disagree even more with the fact that they are filming the last movie in two parts. Why haven't they done that with book two? The second book has so much more content to work with then the third.I really loved the idea of the arena of the second book and I'm disappointed in the amount of what was shown in the movie.However, the movie was still pretty nice and entertaining and the effects were again spot-on. But it's a shame that they did show most of the boring parts of the book in the movie while there are so much awesome scenes in it that seem to be forgotten or are shortened.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
A play-by-play of the book,"I think it's worth a second viewing, if this subject matter isn't too disturbing for you. There isn't much time for character development in this book adaptation, with the new characters like Finnick, Johanna, and Beetee. There are a lot of new characters. And there isn't much finesse added to the scenes by the director. I guess you could say it's a rough cut. But upon a second viewing I think you'll get a lot more out of it. It moves at a rapid pace. I wasn't thrilled by the acting, but there's plenty of good actors in this one, like Woody Harrelson. Unfortunately Cinna doesn't get much screen time. I think they could have shortened some scenes in the Capitol. This is a based on a book about people, not places. And I really couldn't care less about Donald Sutherland's President Snow character. So predictable and boring.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Brilliant film,"The film has a bit of everything: humor, romance, action... It was thought provoking at time and had a few twists and turns here and there. The first film was good, but this one surpassed my expectations. I expected it to be really good, but it surprised me how brilliant it was scripted. Another way it outdid the first one was that the camera didn't flash around as much as the first one. The viewer could just about keep up with the film, and the ending of the film left viewers hungry for more. Jennifer Lawrence's acting was impeccable, as was Liam Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson's. I would definitely recommend the film for anyone who loves action, romance and thrillers, because this film caters for everyone, and if you haven't seen it, you're missing out.

I'm going to talk from a reader's view, because I'm a big fan of the books.Imagine that every detail is mentioned in the movie, every scene, every outfit, every fight.

I thought it was impossible to fall more in love with Josh Hutcherson as Peeta, but nothing is impossible with this guy! Sam Claffin as Finnick proved that he isn't just a pretty boy with nice abs, and Jenna Malone as Johanna was just hilarious!I rated it as 9 out of 10 because of the music, everything was perfect but the music was only good.I told my friends once I finished watching it, that the difference between The Hunger Games and Catching Fire is the same as the difference between Twilight and Lord of The Rings.

Way better than Hunger Games,"Catching Fire works much better as a movie, than Hunger Games did. http://tinovalkki.blogaaja.fi/the-hunger-games-catching-fire-2013/Hunger Games focused on more teenage romance such like Twilight movies.

Katniss grows in her role better as a face of a mutiny. Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss does manage her role way better than Josh Hutcherson as Peeta. Donald Sutherland endorse as President Snow. Action scenes are clever and excited. Violence has kept quite mild to ensure low age limit for the movie, but even like this they are brutal enough. Movie timing works perfectly and length of two and half hour do not feel too long. End scene could be better built, because now it feels a little too rapid and terse. On the other hand we already know that there will be third movie so that can somehow vindicate cliffhanger in this movie. Third movie will be divided to two parts, so we will let see does in feels same kind of capitalize on like Twilight did. Good movie anyway, can't wait to see Mockingjay.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Jennifer Lawrence: The Girl On Fire!,"Hence the title, I'd just like to make it clear Jennifer Lawrence was absolutely brilliant throughout this film. She got the audience both laughing and crying, sad and angry, amused and annoyed -- at the right times! Lawrence aside, the whole cast were at high standards, particularly Harrelson, Hutcherson and Claflin. Even the extras seemed to convince you the whole Hunger Games world was real.The film gripped your attention throughout. If you were a fan of the first movie, you are going to love the second! The special effects have improved by a million years, everything seems so much more advanced. The costumes were mesmerizing, if your a fashion freak I'm sure you'll love this movie even more! The arena was done very well. If you've read the books, the arena will have been on your mind before the film. I was asking myself the same question before the film started: what will the arena be like? Well, I can tell you it was fantastic, just like the film was.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Excellent sequel and a book adaptation,"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire continues the story of the first book/movie with blazing abandon, consistent character development and increasing stages. It's a film worthy of its predecessor, and it very well might be even better.Jennifer Lawrence is the unquestioned star of these movies. Katniss Everdeen is the central focus of the story, and I love it. Her struggles, vulnerabilities, victories and defeats are the driving force behind the plot and how the audience reacts to it. And the best part is that Lawrence completely submerges herself into the role, easily switching tracks whenever needed. Katniss as a character is very closed off, very guarded, which carries the risk that an actress playing her would seem stilted or wooden, but not with Lawrence. You can see the subtle emotions playing across her face at any given time, and the final scene where she stares directly at the camera and you can see dozen emotions running across her face one at a time. Shudders, man, goosebumps even.Not to say the rest of the cast is untalented either. Woody Harrelson and Donald Sutlerland are as great as ever as Haymitch and President Snow, respectively. Josh Hutcherson as Peeta was actually better in this one, in my opinion. More bitter, which gave him depth. I'm still not completely sold on Liam Hemsworth as Gale, but he did his job. Too much of an obvious tragic bad boy, I think. And the rest of the actors did equally good jobs, managing to convey a lot of exposition and storytelling with relatively little screen time and with a lot of grace.The special effects and the visuals were very good. Larger budget obviously meant improvement in these areas, and it shows. And thankfully they toned down the shaky cam, which improved the viewing experience so much. It's also a well directed film. The storytelling is smooth and flawless. A complex and multilayered story is laid out in front of us in a way that feels natural and is easy to follow. At no point did I felt that they skipped over anything or that the film lingered too much. It was a well-paced, well-told story with a proper, might I even call it perfect arc. The closest one to perfection I've seen in recent years.If I had to nitpick I'd say that when we get back to the actual Hunger Games, the novelty has worn off. The arena is still exciting and at least it's different enough that it feels somewhat new, but the actual mechanics of young kids and adults fighting against one another are nothing we haven't seen before. It's still good and it's still enjoyable to watch as an action piece, but oh man, what if this arena had been the arena in the first film. That would have been unbelievable. Still, a nitpick at most, so don't turn away from the movie because of that.I liked this film. The ending left me wanting for more and I can't wait for the next one. This is what a sequel should be about. Continuation of the story, more character growth, new characters in moderation, doing what the first film did right, learning from the mistakes of the earlier films. The whole package. If you liked the first Hunger Games, you're going to love this one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Great Film,"I loved the movie and think that it's a great continuation of the first. When it came to the end I was really annoyed, not by lack of quality, but by the fact that it's a real cliff-hanger and I just wanted more. Jennifer Lawrence was a star once again and we even saw glimpses of her truly hilarious personality being portrayed through Katniss. The love story becomes much more complicated in Catching Fire and I definitely find myself feeling sorry for both Peeta and Gail. I also loved seeing more of Primrose and Katniss' mother along with president Snow. I think the movie is an almost perfect balance of romance and action with a tad of heart wrenching emotion. Truly great and I'm not afraid to admit that I have seen it more than once.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Packing the right amount of drama and action,"While the market's saturated with Vampire romances (hiding its shades of abstinence, cheesy romance and what not), The Hunger Games took a leap forward introducing a bloody albeit sensible saga for the teens. Much more serious in its presentation, Suzanne Collins has written a trilogy both teens and adults can enjoy and the movies based on it are just as good. As evident from the first Hunger Games, Catching Fire is no different and it doesn't disappoint the least. I know I am late, I watched this movie like 2 weeks back and then I was caught in a Smaug- sized void.Helmed by Francis Lawrence of Constantine and I Am Legend fame, Catching Fire continues where the original left off, we are introduced to a very disturbed and vulnerable Katniss Everdeen having hallucinations post her first Hunger Games. And just when you thought everything would be fine and well for her, it gets worse when 75th Hunger Games starts, also known as Quarter Quell. The first act of the movie was lush with characters new and old, setting things in motion leading to its finale in Mockingjay Parts 1 and 2. It did have a slow pace but it was captivating enough to make you feel that Panam and its politics were real. It does a very good job of showing the totalitarian capital and the undemocratic ways its politics goes.Of course it all gets unarguably thrilling when the Hunger Games starts and it does get the adrenaline pumping. Our hapless heroes and their formidable foes are put head to head against all kinda new threats and it does make you wonder ""May the odds be ever in your favor, Seriously?"" Katniss and Peeta's bond goes stronger throughout the Games and it all ends in a cliffhanger and a rather intriguing one at that. It keeps you wanting more.Jennifer Lawrence, indisputably, comes off as a winner here. She might not grab another Oscar for role but the way this girl acts is just jaw- droppingly convincing and yes, she was indeed a sight for sore eyes. Elizabeth Banks was annoying but i suppose she was written that way. Woody Harrelson, without surprise, steals every scene he was in whereas Donald Sutherland on the other hand felt nefarious beyond limits. Instead of Wes Bentley's Seneca Crane, Philip Seymour Hoffman shares the screen as the new Gamemaker and showing off some good performance as well.IMHO, Catching Fire got way too dark and I sometimes questioned myself if the fiction was intended for teens. I was not too happy with the weird love triangle tension between Katniss, Peeta and Gale. It remains to see how Mockingjay would end up, its safe to say in Francis' hands its off to a good start.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Catching Fire, A Review","The Hunger Games: Catching FireCatching Fire, is the long awaited second part of the Hunger Games Saga. After the resounding success of the first movie, fans were hopeful that the second would be just as captivating. Put simply, it was. Even after a change in Directors. (Directed now by Francis Lawrence) The second movie starts out strong. The seeds of revolution have started to take root, and the hostility towards the Capitol is growing visibly. The acting is really well done. Instead of the somewhat stoic portrayal of characters in the first movie, I felt that this one more accurately depicted the emotions of the characters as they were meant to be. Emotional train wrecks. Particularly Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence). The overall plot keeps very close to the book, much more than the first, and with the omission of only a few note-able scenes, I feel fans will appreciate the Directors attention to detail. The movie does feel a bit long at times.(Runs, just over 2 hours) This isn't really a reflection on the movie so much as it is the accurate portrayal of the book. More time is spent in the arena, and the audience feels it. Acting is spot on. Johanna Mason and Finnick Odair (played by Jena Malone and Sam Claflin respectively) are fantastically depicted. The other champions are cast expertly as well and I find it hard to criticize anything in this area. Camera angles and movements are much improved over the first, and observant movie goers will notice the screen get larger when you first enter the arena. The sets look stunning, and the Arena is a masterpiece. Perhaps my one big concern is that, without prior knowledge of the story, without reading the books, the movie COULD be hard to keep track of or interested in. It's simply the nature of the plot, and reading the books is strongly recommended. This movie should please audiences worldwide.Overall: Strong movie, excellent acting. Held back only by the complex plot. 8.5/10(Acting: 10/10) (Directing: 9/10) (Plot: 9/10) (CGI Effects: 8.5/10) (Stand Alone without book: 8/10) (Ease of viewing, without plot knowledge: 7.5/10 (Variable per viewer))",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
I feel this one is better than the first one,"I still do not agree with the 9 and 10 star ratings but I feel this movie is slightly better than the first one. This is primarily because Jennifer Lawrence's character is more mature and she seems more comfortable in the role. She is no longer an immature, naive and lost child. At least not most of the time.The entire setup is still as ludicrous as before. It is a silly and depressing background scenario and it is definitely not my cup of tea. The people running around in ridiculous hair-do, makeup and showing a severe lack of intelligence is not making things better.The enjoyment of this movie comes when the games finally start. These parts are definitely better than in the first movie. The various dangers are well done, the effects good and there is an interesting overall theme to the arena and the dangers instead of randomly throwing new menaces at players that seemed to be the strategy in the first movie.To me the enjoyment of this movie is in the games themselves. This is probably because I just do not like the rest of the plot. The depressing scenario. The nonsensical and/or oppressive behavior, backstabbing etc. etc.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
For those wondering...,"..if this is better than The Hunger Games? Yes, oh yes it is. The Hunger Games was a fantastic opening to this epic franchise and Catching Fire wastes no time in going bigger while taking advantage of its massive $140 million budget.The games themselves seem so much more intense this time round, where danger is literally right around every corner. The budget has gloriously afforded Panem and all the districts to be fleshed out in both colour and scale.Jennifer Lawrence goes above and beyond in her role of Katniss. She has rooted herself firmly in this franchise as the star player and makes precious every moment of screen time she is given.While Josh Hutcherson has come into his own playing the more underlining emotions of rejection and his acknowledgment of it.A very welcome element to Catching Fire is the humour. As the plot is quite dark, these moments allow the audience to relax a bit!Catching Fire is very slick in terms of building tension. It always feels as if it is going somewhere, and the climax echoes this nicely, which left me reaching for a copy of Mockingjay, desperate to find out what happens next!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Catching Fire Burnt my Opinion,"Waiting until this movie came out on bluray, was definitely a smart decision. I really enjoyed the previous Hunger Games movie but this sequel didn't follow up with the same caliber of film. Jennifer Lawrence's performance was strong as always, she plays the tough underdog everyone loves to get behind. Josh Hutcherson never really shows a wide emotional range, he seems to have the same monotone attitude through the whole movie. Elizabeth Banks, Woody Harrelson and Stanley Tucci all round out the cast with great supporting roles. It is a real shame Philip Seymour Hoffman passed away because it is going to be hard to fill his shoes with the last two movies in the series.The first movie consisted a lot of the actually games where this movie was majority of setting up the games. The movie doesn't really start off strong and kind of drags. It is heavy on the romance Katniss and Peeta have to put on display for all of the districts. I just feel the pace of the movie was a lot slower than the first and some of the material could have been cut out. I wish there was more shown of how the other tributes were eliminated in the games, especially how interesting the new arena was. The ending also felt a bit rushed and it did not leave me wanting more. After the first movie I couldn't wait until the sequel came out and this just didn't make me feel the same way.I did enjoy while they were training for the games, though it was a bit short. The action in this movie was intense and kept me on the edge of my seat when it was happening. The start of the games was definitely awesome because not only did they beat up Cinna(Lenny Kravitz) in front of Katniss moments before the start, but all of the tributes were placed on pedestals in the middle of a lake. The jungle atmosphere seemed a lot more energetic than the forest than the previous film. The concept of the clock with deadly booby traps every hour was clever and different. I was intrigued and wanted to see more of what the dome had in store for the tributes but was ultimately let down. Hopefully the next film will rekindle my interest for this series. That is why I am giving this movie a 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

It never ever gets boring.,"The movie 'The Hunger Games – Catching Fire' is the second film of the trilogy directed by Gary Ross, which is based on the novel by Suzanne Collins. The book is very gripping and so is the movie because there aren't many differences between the book and the movie and that's why we think that everyone likes it. It's a many sided movie which consists of action and love so everyone can find interest in it and we think it definitely is worth seeing it.In the second part of the series, the main characters Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta (‎Josh Hutcherson) are forced to take part in the 75th hunger games and present their districts. But this year is not like the year before because there can only be one winner. In the arena, they have to fight against the other tributes from the other districts but it's different this time because Katniss and Peeta form a group to survive.The love story between Katniss and Peeta is complicated because Katniss actually fancies Gail (Liam Hemsworth) with whom she was together all her childhood. But all she and Peeta went through in the past welded them together and you can see how Katniss slowly develops feelings for Peeta. But Peeta has a crush on Katniss and says that he would rather die than live without her. It's cute that he says something like that because it shows how much he loves her. You can say it's really touching and it is a proof of love to Katniss.All in one the movie is really gripping and worth seeing. When you watch it, it is like you are with them in the arena and feel with them. You don't know what is going to happen and you're feeling scared at some points but then there are scenes in which you feel joy and happiness. We really like the movie because for us it's a movie you can always watch and it never ever gets boring.Lisa S. and Jasmin W.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
The Vidiot Reviews,"The Hunger Games: Catching FireWhen you catch fire in a dystopian future, survivors don't extinguish it; they gather around your body for warmth.Fortunately, the conflagration in this sci-fi movie is a controlled burn.Motivated by district uprisings resulting from the game's most-recent winners, Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), President Snow (Donald Sutherland) announces an all-star Third Quarter Quell.When Katniss and her mentor's (Woody Harrelson) names are drawn, Peeta volunteers to take his position.Meanwhile, the other tributes (Jeffrey Wright, Jena Malone, Amanda Plummer) are just as upset over their reenrollment, and conspire to topple the affluent Capitol.The second film based on in the teen Lit series, Catching Fire is darker than its dour predecessor, but for good reason.Tonality aside, the eclectic cast continues to grow and excel, while the seditious story starts to take root.Incidentally, the Hunger Games are impartial, unless, of course, there's a Russian judge.Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Catching Fire: Amazing Movie, better then the first. Jennifer Lawrence in her Top Performance","Since the Preview begins, i saw this few times in cinema. The second part of Hunger Games is much better then the first one. I loved the first part, but Catching Fire rock the first in all elements. Catching Fire brings: - More Emotions - More Dramatic - better political Background - the brutality of the System - the fight of the characters between them self and the others - more Scenes with Katniss Longbow talents Espasically Katniss fight between herself and the System are one of the best. Every Scene are amazing, Jennifers Performance is again Top, also of the co-stars. This movie are very near of the book. The Box office results and the visitors in Cinema speak for the movie. Im going one more time next days, because it is my top movie of the year. Looking Forward to the next parts :)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"a great sequel, powerful but not as character led as the first","This is the second installment in The Hunger Games trilogy; a dystopic world where the difference between the rich and the poor is absolute and what society there is, is largely based on fantasy (in the capital) and hard graft and scratching a living in the rest of the country. The idea behind the story is fabulous, extremely clever and rather original but in the films I find the eccentric dress of the ""society"" people really overly flamboyant. I know it's a symptom of the greater problem but it's not adequately explained and doesn't make sense to me. The costumes are a riot though!There are shadows of the Reich in the way that punishment is metered out for those considered insubordinate, and certain sections of society are considered not in favour, and the way that revolution is quashed is insidious and frightening; the scheming of the higher powers behind the scenes. The rallying behind the tributes Catniss and Peeta is moving and uplifting and whilst that is emotive, the characters of the tributes (other than Catness and Peeta) aren't really as in depth as in the first film. I'd not read this one first, whereas had for the original film so perhaps that made a difference. It was however highly emotional and gripping for the most part. I found my attention waining, and there being too much contrivance in the dome this time, less suspense with the challenges they face, and some plot contrivance was predictable. There was some unpredictability in the film, however, just when I was thinking I was frustrated with the length of one bit, there was a curve ball and the film was over!It's an impressive film, like the first, with huge spectacle and drama, fast-paced action, but rather disjointed in terms of pacing to begin with. I found that a little annoying, as scenes are short and choppy and clearly heavily edited as they are trying to pack a lot of narrative into film introduction. It means that you don't have time to emotionally invest. Most of the acting is good, with a few hammy performances but as in the last film Jennifer Lawrence stands out by a long way and steels every scene. Her emotional range is excellent, and I imagine that some of the scenes must have been quite draining. I didn't feel so connected to characters in this film, and as such I feel this one slightly less successful than the first. I wasn't so invested and there was a certain safe predictability.Overall a great entertaining film, well worth the watch if you enjoyed the first. It doesn't really stand alone, so you'd need background, but I would recommend it. It's a good sequel in that it doesn't disappoint after the first, and has a point to it, and is quite a visually enjoyable film but wasn't as gripping as The Hunger Games.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
The odds are never in your favor,"This is the second instalment in The Hunger Games trilogy. I went to see the movie with a higher level of excitement than I did the previous one, as can be seen from the tone of my review. Partly, it's due to the fact that I've read the books in the time between. I was bothered by the style of writing in the books, which I talked about in detail in the review of the first book. However, the story itself and Katniss' character captured my imagination, and I managed to get passed the style for the most part. The second book was my favourite. It had the most imaginative story line out of the three, and the greatest shocker at the end.Now onto the movie. My greatest problem with the previous movie was the shaky cam, and the weird close-ups. Luckily, we got a new director for this instalment, and he didn't suffer from this ""artistic"" compulsion. According to the credits of the next two (yes, Mockingjay looks to be a two-parter, yay) movies, he will stay on. That is great news to me, because I really loved the movie. This year had been full of disappointments. Man of Steel I couldn't even review, I was so saddened by it. City of Bones was watchable, but didn't rock my world. The Colony had a great trailer, I just wish the movie had been even remotely like that. I was almost afraid Catching Fire would follow along the same vein. I'm so glad it didn't! It was probably one of the best movie adaptations that I've seen, and it's probably going to make my top ten all time movie favourites list. It was that good. No more shaky cam! The images were clean and grand. The settings just like I imagined. The clothes and the make-up were wonderful. Visually, it couldn't have been better. The story compared to the book followed it well. Of course, there were some differences, but the book covers a lot of things, and I thought it had the important things. It has been a while since I read the book, but I didn't have a sense of anything major being left out. Maybe there was something about District 13 in there, but I'm not sure, it may have been in the next book. I went to see it with a guy who hasn't read the books, so I used him to test the coherency and how well the story could be understood without that background. According to him and my test questions, the major points went over well. One little bit that was different, is that not everything was through Katniss' eyes. This gave us an interesting glimpse into some of President Snow's actions. I was glad to see those. Tissue warning should have been at the start of the film, because I had tears in my eyes at several points. Just one word, not to spoil anything. Rue.Now for the characters and the actors. Jennifer Lawrence carried the story on her back. She was truly brilliant here. Her face showed Katniss' emotions perfectly. The part got somewhat harder here, I think. As I wrote in my book reviews, after the events in the first instalment, Katniss clearly suffers from PTSD. It was apparent often on her face how she could barely keep it together, and how she lost it sometimes. I could feel Jennifer being Katniss. She did show her comical side in THE elevator scene, which I won't spoil. Her face there though, priceless. I think we all needed that little laugh in the grimness of the story. Josh Hutcherson seemed to have come into his role of Peeta. In the previous movie I wasn't completely convinced, but he won me over. The rest of the cast had matured into their roles as well. I guess that's the benefit of playing in a series. Though next to Jennifer, they all felt as minor characters. I confess, I had mostly just eyes for her. I'll check out the other people when I rewatch the movie.I have to write a little side note here. I was watching the movie in English, with Hungarian subtitles. Now I had no need of subtitling, but they were sometimes hard to ignore, and I read them. I facepalmed a lot. When I saw how they translated ""May the odds be ever in your favor"", I had a little rant at the screen. It was completely wrong. Sometimes half of the sentences were missing. Overall, it was a poor job, whoever did it. So all you people out there who don't have to see that abomination, be ever so glad. Why was that phrase so important to translate right? Because it's a mockery. The odds never were, and never will be in their favor, for anyone in the Districts. It depicts their relationship to the Capitol in one, simple sentence. They have no chance, no choices, they are just slaves to the Capitol. The people in charge feeding them that line are trying to give them a false promise of chance, but that can be ripped from them at any moment. Some people on the internet wrote that it means ""Good luck"". They were wrong. It doesn't. It means, you have a chance to make your life and that of your District better, we are giving that to you. That is the promise of the Games. What is given, however, can be taken away just as easily. That is what people realise, when they change ""ever"", to ""never"".Overall, this is a great movie. Others may not agree with me, but I was totally pumped by the end. I won't tell you what signs I was making towards the screen, intending them for Snow, when the end approached. I recommend the film for everyone, really.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Still not incredible, but much more credible.","After seeing the first movie, I more or less decided not to watch any more of this franchise. For some reason I quickly changed my mind, and I'm glad that I did. I thought this second film was a lot better.The storyline was much stronger. Even fantasy has to achieve some kind of credibility, and, in contrast to the first Hunger Games movie, this one actually did.On top of that, we got to see more of Donald Sutherland in this second film. He was perfectly cast for his role as the president, and I only wish his role would have been bigger. Another favorite actor of mine, Philip Seymour Hoffman, was a welcome addition. His role isn't very big either, but his performance in all of his brief scenes is rock solid.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
A step up from the first!,"I was a huge fan of the previous film, The Hunger Games, and the books so I was so excited to watch this and the film didn't disappoint. Jennifer Lawrence returns as Katniss Everdeen and the film is set a few months after she and fellow tribute, Peeta Mellark (played by Josh Hutcherson), have won The Hunger Games. There has been an uprising in the districts due to the fact that were two victors instead of one and Katniss and Peeta have to face these results of their rebellion on their Victory Tour where they visit the 12 districts and make a speech about how thankful they are to have won the Games. After finishing the tour, Katniss thinks she is well clear of the Games until President Snow announces that each living victor from the previous Games will fight to the death in the 75th Hunger Games, also known as a Quarter Quell. Since Katniss is the only female victor from her district to have won the Games, she has no choice but to battle other tributes in the arena once again. Will she survive the Arena again? As much as I loved the first film, I definitely think this one was better which is quite rare as, usually, the sequels are worse than the first film (Kick-Ass 2, Taken 2, and many more) but in this case, the second film was a lot better than the first. I think the Games in this one are a lot more violent and scarier than the first Games as the Capitol are doing everything they can to prevent a rebellion from happening. Jennifer Lawrence is perfect as the leading lady, Katniss Everdeen, she really understands the depths of the character and shows it. We are also introduced to several new characters, including the late Philip Seymour Hoffman as the latest gamemaker Plutarch Heavensbee. In one of his last performances he is the perfect casting as Heavensbee, he is exactly how I imagined him in the book. We are also introduced to some new Tributes as well including Sam Claflin as the charming Finnick Odair and Jena Malone as the fierce and independent Johanna Mason. These two pull off great performances. I wasn't so sure of the casting, at first, but my opinions soon changed once I watched the film. This sequel is full of drama and action and ends with a cliffhanger that will make you dying to watch the third. If you love action, then I'd definitely recommend this.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

Her supporting cast are equally good, Donald Sutherland in particular is just brilliant.The only reasons I have marked the film down are simple; occasionally bad dialogue, a slightly sluggish middle section and the fact the direction feels a bit less interesting than the first film.

Lawrence is able to emote katniss's pain, fear, anger effortlessly, and so believably...that, if you allow yourself to just respond, then she is able to make you connect with her, which enables an emotional film experience. My primary reason for watching movies, is to experience feelings. And to feel, you have to make a connection with the characters in some way. And Jennifer Lawrence allows this in a powerful way. Yes, there were parts of movie I thought could have been done better. But, if you allow your self to connect with Lawrence's character, and rather than asking questions, simply allow yourself to feel her emotions, then...an exceptional movie experience awaits you.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
A Polished Sequel That Amps Up the Thrills,"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, directed by Francis Lawrence, is a significant improvement over its predecessor. The director's decision to ditch the shaky cam and choppy editing present in the first movie results in a much more polished and enjoyable viewing experience. The story is almost identical to the first film, but it is more effectively told, and the stakes are even higher this time around.The action sequences are more thrilling, and the improved special effects help to create a more immersive and believable world. However, despite all the refinements, the film is still very similar to the original and doesn't take many risks with the formula.The tone of these films also feels strange to me. They are very dark and dour, dealing with weighty themes of social inequality and oppressive regimes, contrasting with the fundamentally silly concept of the Hunger Games themselves. As a result, I've struggled to fully engage with these films and this world. Nonetheless, it's worth noting that this instalment stands as the strongest entry in the series.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
bad but not the worst ever,"It was getting better reviews than the first one but I thought it was worse.NOTE If you haven't seen the first one this movie won't make sense.Many minor plot holes but no major holes so that is a plus.Maybe I expected too much.Overall it felt like a waste of time.If I come out of a movie and think ""why did they make it""?If the only answer is because it's a sure money maker then it has failed in my opinion.Rent it, it is not worth seeing in a theatre.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Visually captivating and action packed, but...","I really like Hunger Games franchise for being what it is - tightly packed with action, always very visual, and with some very deep theme underneath a simple dystopian flick. Catching Fire is the second movie in the series and follows the source material quite closely but few necessary alterations. And it is what it should be - an action packed movie to catch your eyes on the screen and sit on the edge of the seat, right? Yes and no. It is very visual and beautiful, the action sequences are great, even the new cast members are great, the arena's even better than I'd imagined it to be, but... Oh, unfortunately there's a 'but' here, and quite a big one - Katnis Everdeen. While in the first movie her inner struggle translated quite decently to the screen language, in this one it fell quite hard. I've read the books, and I know what was going on inside her head and all, but my friend, who joined me to the movie, and who've never read those books, and only saw the first and now the second movie, was way too much puzzled on what kept Katnis tick and tock, and all. So I just say, that what we have here is a strong 2nd movie of total 4, and it's good on all levels but catching one on fire emotionally.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

I like the movie, because it shows some good moments in it, and maybe cry able, as i did, because i thought it was so good. From the first movie they have improved and make it even better, like how its not all about the hunger games in the beginning, and i LOVE the trailer, cant simple stop watching it.

Closer to the Book,"One thing I will give Catching Fire credit for is being more akin to the book. Of course, movies will always have limitations books don't have and vice-versa, but this movie did a fairly good job.Although I liked Hunger Games better, both the book and the movie, this movie was a very close second. The conflict in this movie was the same but different. The Capitol and President Snow are still the enemy, the various districts are still oppressed and the Hunger Games make another appearance, but that's where the similarities stop.The ante has been upped by both the Capitol and the districts. In other words, both sides have a lot to lose this time around with the Hunger Games. I like how Suzanne Collins seamlessly and neatly wove in another Hunger Games with Katniss and Peeta being thrust back into them. It is a solid, solid second installment, just not quite as good as the first.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Vast improvement over the first movie. Still a little lacking, but definitely worth seeing for $10.","I bought all of the Hunger Games audiobooks and listened to them several times. I know the story backward and forward. I wasn't thrilled with the first movie at all. I thought it was completely devoid of emotion in what should have been a moving picture. It was just OK.Breathe easy Hunger Games fans, this one was a vast improvement. Considering the volume of material, they did an admirable job of squeezing it into a little over two hours. The whole thing was a still a little rushed, but the important parts were done very well. Jennifer Lawrence was tremendous again and Josh Hutcherson was decent. When you read the books, you have a picture in your head of how the events play out. This movie really did match my ideas of how things looked. The director did a tremendous job of creating the quarter quell arena - it was perfect. The second book required a little more imagination based on the things that happened in the arena, and all of them looked realistic. Considering the amount of revenue these movies generate, I still think they could have put a little more money into the CGI because it still looked a little cheap in parts. But overall, I was pleased. I took six other people to the show this time and all of them enjoyed it much more than the first movie. More time could have been spent on the arena action, but the pacing was much better in this movie.The Finnick casting wasn't perfect, but the guy is a good actor and passed the test. Johanna Mason was a pleasant surprise, the woman nailed her part. I really liked the job she did, and she actually turned her into a likable character. As expected, PSH was good as Plutarch. Woody Harrelson is one of my favorite actors and he was just OK in this one. They can't seem to get his character right...it's just off a little. Liam Hemsworth once again was god-awful, and the romance sequences in these movies are terrible.Overall the movie was solid. Money well spent.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
The results of the media hype...,"I watched the 1st movie and in my opinion, it can be used as a perfect example of how manipulative and powerful the (social) media and advertisers can be.Nevertheless, as a genre fan, I decided to give the second movie a chance. Boy, do I regret that. I was hoping of some kind of evolution in the story, or some big event that would show a little bit of action, emotion, or at least to make us care about the characters. In the end, it was just a lengthy copy of the first one. And that's not good.The acting is flat, the direction monotonous, the action is terrible and the audience does not care who lives and who dies.Don't waste your time on this, unless your age is around 12.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
One of the best book-to-movie adaptations in recent years.,"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire was EVERYTHING I HOPED IT WOULD BE AND MORE.The wait was definitely worth it.The scale was amped up to the extreme. Everything was BIGGER, BRIGHTER AND DEFINITELY BETTER than the first movie. The costumes, the sets, the cornucopia, the symbolism. Everything. The stakes are much higher this time around and you can actually feel the gravity of the situation because of the brilliant directing and acting. And oh my God, the acting in this movie was PHENOMENAL. Everyone brought their A game to the set.JENNIFER LAWRENCE, YOU ARE AN ACTING GODDESS. Seriously, she IS Katniss through and through. She owns that character and nobody is even in the same league as her. In only the first 5 minutes of the movie, I started shaking. Her fear, her vulnerability her stubbornness. She nailed it on the head! Josh Hutcherson did a great job as Peeta and Haymitch (Woody Harrelson), and Effie (Elizabeth Backs) totally transformed into their characters so awesomely. Gale (Liam Hemsworth) felt a lot more human in this movie and pulled off the character well. Finnick and Johanna were freaking awesome! Perfect casting in my opinion. Jena Malone's acting was one of the best parts of this movie. She embodied the character to the tee; her fierceness, fiery attitude and her unforgiving demeanor. And Sam Claflin was smoldering hot, and sassy yet vulnerable at the same time; everything Finnick is. Donald Sutherland and Phillip Seymour Hoffman were SO GOOD. You could actually feel the 'EVIL' flowing through their veins. And Stanley Tucci is Stanley Tucci. Perfect as always.Now on to the plot. The story picks after the 74th games, when the victors have to go on the Victory tour. And it is here when the start of the rebellion begins and Katniss decides which side she wants to be on. First of all I have to say, Francis Lawrence did an absolutely brilliant job with this movie. The symbolism, and parallelism present in this really hit you hard. I was so impressed by how much he managed to cover and how stunning everything looked. The visuals and the CGI were definitely an upgrade from the first one and it all looked fantastic. I was also super surprised to hear so many direct quotes from the book, included in the script (something which the previous movie seriously lacked!)The Music Score was good. Nothing that exhilarating about it except for maybe Panem's Nation Anthem. It sounded even more majestic than before.The costumes this time round were stunning! Trish Summervile really outdid herself by designing so many gorgeous and unique outfits for the film. I really hope she gets considered for an Oscar.All in all Catching Fire was a FANTASTIC movie and I think it is one of the best book-to-screen adaptations ever made. Francis Lawrence did an amazing job and Jennifer Lawrence just owned this movie. I give it an A- Can't wait for Mockingjay!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Balancing taut emotion with tense action, this middle chapter of the 'Hunger Games' counts among some of the best dystopian fiction","Despite being based on a young adult novel, Gary Ross' 'The Hunger Games' belonged to one of the rare few which managed to attract a crossover audience from all quadrants, winning the praise of both critics and audiences alike. It did not pander to its core demographic of teenagers; rather, it played as a smart and gripping dystopian thriller set in a futuristic America called Panem which was run as a totalitarian state with one 'Capitol' and 12 districts. It was also a socio-political allegory on propaganda and violence as reality show entertainment, especially since the Games essentially pitted young boys and girls from the districts against each other in a fight to the last one standing.'Catching Fire', the second instalment in Suzanne Collins' hugely popular series, assumes right from the start that its audience is familiar with the context and the events from the first movie. The script by Simon Beaufoy and Michael deBruyn opens the same way as Collins' book, and that is by continuing right where its predecessor stopped. Our heroine, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and her fellow tribute cum romantic interest in the area Peeta Mellack (Josh Hutcherson) are back in District 12 after successfully winning the sympathies of their televised audience and defeating the rules of the game, but President Snow (Donald Sutherland) is neither amused nor impressed by their sleight-of-hand.Unbeknownst to Katniss, her act of 'love' for Peeta has given people in the districts hope, and with that the courage to rise up against their oppressors. Whereas at first she was fighting for herself and her loved ones, Katniss has since become so much more, a symbol to galvanise the masses - if she had the tenacity to do so. It takes guts and no lack of clarity to vision for a 'Hunger Games' movie to make its audience wait more than an hour before the said competition actually gets along, but by doing so, Beaufoy, deBruyn and director Francis Lawrence sets this second chapter by making it more meaningful - and we dare say heartfelt - than the first movie.More than half the screen time is therefore devoted to a tense and riveting exploration of the allegory behind Collins' books as parable about inequity and class warfare. From the sight of Peacekeepers enforcing harsh and brutal martial-like law on the citizens in the various districts to the indifference of the people in the Capitol, (Francis) Lawrence balances incident and exposition to stir up the indignation of his audience towards the sheer injustice of the totalitarian regime under Snow (which Sutherland, to his credit, portrays with chilling but never over-the-top menace). And yet, even though the scale on which the events unfold has grown much wider, Lawrence never loses the earlier picture's intimate focus on Katniss.Yes, the character beats are still there - and if we may add, stronger than before. As she realises just how things have changed and will change around her, the 17-year-old Katniss has to decide if she will choose to cower under Snow's threat of her family or stand up for something more. That's no easy decision to make, and right from the beginning with a scene where Katniss goes into an anxiety attack recalling a kill she made in the earlier Games, there is never any doubt that she is no more than an ordinary teenager thrust and called upon to be brave beyond belief in these extraordinary circumstances. Jennifer Lawrence is truly excellent here, equal parts vulnerable and steely, and only the hardest of hearts will not be stirred to empathy.Just so because it is the 75th Hunger Games, Snow and his new games planner Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) get to hatch a plan to put Katniss back into a new arena. The third 'Quarter Quell' will draw its contestants from among the pool of victors from the district, and since Katniss is the only female victor from District 12, she is automatically chosen. As she finds herself back at the Capitol, Katniss also finds herself amongst a more idiosyncratic bunch - among them the pretty blond Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin) and his octogenarian mentor Mags (Lynn Cohen), the straight-talking rebel Johanna Mason (Jena Malone), and a pair of oddball inventor-types nicknamed Nuts and Volts (Amanda Plummer and Jeffrey Wright).Alliances will once again need to be forged in the field in order to survive, but besides the constant suspicion of betrayal, Katniss and Peeta now have to contend with more than just their competitors - the environment is a rigged jungle arena with poison fogs and killer monkeys as 'elements of nature'. It isn't any of the filmmakers' fault if the Games this time round lacks the earlier's knife-edge sense of danger; compared to the first book, Collins' doesn't make the Games count for as much as it did, for the very reason that they are but a means to an end, which serves as probably the worst kept twist ending that lays the groundwork for the third and concluding instalment 'Mockingjay'.Indeed, those expecting a repeat of the earlier movie will likely find themselves disappointed. The straightforward thrills of Ross' film are somewhat more muted this time round; ditto the heady romantic triangle of Katniss, Peeta and Katniss' childhood sweetheart and best friend Gale (Liam Hemsworth). But in its place is a much meatier piece of sci-fi, built on compelling themes of tyranny, revolt and most of all personal fortitude, anchored in a fascinating lead performance by one of the best young adult actresses in Hollywood today. And all that pre-production trouble that saw Francis Lawrence stepping into Ross' shoes? Well, there's not even a hint of that here, and if anything, it's surer in tone and pacing and devoid of the annoying shaky-cam stylistics Ross employed.True to its title therefore, this middle instalment genuinely catches fire, igniting the stage for what promises to be an epic conclusion.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
The Hunger Games:  Catching Fire (Don't Judge by the Books...,"Literal by any means though - otherwise the film adaptation would never measure up to the standard expectation based on Suzanne Collins originally written series of The Hunger Games books. For a start I think the plot of the first film was a bit wee understated due to lack clarity on the history of the formation of Panem (which previously known as North America). Some audiences especially from the group of non-followers of Suzanne Collins were bound to be riddled by the question, 'Why did the Capitol come out with the idea of the Hunger Games at first place..? There was a tiny loophole in the prelude of the first film I just thought it could have been better to navigate with some opening scene of nuclear holocaust launched by Capitol to destroy the District 13 entire population due their rebellion against Capitol. At that point, I was left to wonder, it seems that the dir. Gary Ross merely count on the popularity of Suzanne Collins' books to do the job for viewers' comprehension on history details outlining the remarkable turnover reign from North America to Panem; and also under the regimentation on food ration by the federal government of Capitol, the Districts population are thrust into massive level of hunger. But sadly, all of these vivid imagery can only be reached out through the perspective of the books.'Against all the odds in the 2nd film follows Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) who leads a glamorous life and gains popularity on both Capitol and the Districts. But soon she is about to learn that the remarkable shift in her life proves always comes with a price. During her touring with her fellow victor, Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson, there are signs of rebellion brewing across the Districts that inadvertently attributes President Snow to see Katniss as a potential threat who will rally people from Districts to rebel against the Capitol.Soon Katniss is thrown into an ultimate showdown against other victors from the past Hunger Games. But this time around, the 75th Annual Hunger Games which is also known as 'Quarter Quell' turns outs to be underlying conspiracy by Snow to destroy Katniss Everdeen - once and for all.' Overall the 2nd film of The Hunger Games converged at the angle outlining our protagonist, Katniss Everdeen on her road of her spiritual exploration followed with her determination on which path she will be undertaking, to become the ally of the supremo Capitol; or the rebellious group from all over the Districts? There were a couple of few hits in the plots particularly the idea of 'Tik Tok' and Cabin in the Woods traps- alike in the arena were pretty amazing. I've got my emotional struck at certain scenes particularly when Katniss witnessing an old man gunned down in cold blood by a 'peacemaker' (a Capitol soldier) during the time when she mourned the deceased Rue at District 11.Plot aside, I find the dystopian set somehow appeared more like a contemporary metropolitan, not the surreal futuristic which supposed to be, the one with flying automobiles which could be seen in the sci-fi backdrops of Fifth Element and Total Recall Remake by Len Wiseman.Choreography disposition was fairly smooth despite few gasps in between. The most fascinating moment in term of action sequences would be Katniss using her archery skills at training center, taking down all the holograms! Nonetheless, it could have been better if such combat expertise being fully translated into Katniss' fight with a horde of 'Afterearth'-alike carnivorous baboons.Jennifer Lawrence undeniably the 'Girl on Fire', she earned that and no other girl can steal that title from her. But sadly her thunders in my opinion, was not being equally shared to her two male sidekicks, Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth who played Peeta Mellark and Gale Hawthorne respectively. (Sorry..not that I'm sexist, it just that I couldn't shake off the film adaptation just don't do the justice for this duo compared to the original characteristics as in Suzanne Collins books) Peeta Mellark in the book is an exceptional intelligent boy beyond his age, exuberant as the way he sees thing lightly and positive, not as portrayed by Josh in film adaptation (no hardfeelings to Josh's fans, Josh was more like a broody and a little whiny type). There goes to his rival as well, Gale Hawthorne who was supposed to be a strikingly bold and savvy fighter/hunter in the Suzanne Collins' version. I'm sorry to say that despite with lots of publicities, I just don't see that burning spirits unleashed out by Liam Hemsworth (or perhaps Liam should be taking on Peeta Mellark just as what he auditioned before for that role) In a nutshell, The Hunger Games is a decent film adaptation, but still a milestone from the original imagery as in Suzanne Collins' Panem world. Bad investment advice..? Set your expectation a bit wee lower then you'll see it differently!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Surpassed my expectations to say the least,"I was interested in this movie ever since the teaser trailer came out. I have already read all of the books prior to the release of the first movie. The Hunger Games, although I enjoyed it as a film, it wasn't great or anywhere near as good as the book. Catching Fire is my favorite book out of the 3, so coming in I was nervous to see if I would come out love/hating it like the first film, and let me say I was really blown away with how much they got RIGHT both as an adaption and as a quality film. The sets, the costume designs, the CGI, and especially the cinematography were just great and leagues above the first one. The film was solidly paced and written, with a lot more character development that makes the characters more easily to digest rather than them being forced, as well as the performances. We get to understand Katniss on a deeper level, get to see Peeta develop as a character, we get to see President Snow's true evil and ruthlessness, and we get to see the development of important plot points in the entire series. I am going to make it clear that I am NOT one of those fans that immediately gives a movie exaggerated amounts of praise (or there lack of) just because I like the books. I respect the art of film too much to even base a movie's judgement by fanboyism. Francis Lawrence, I give a standing ovation to his direction. This film is real quality, has real substance, great performances, and leaves you wanting more. Mockingjay Part 1 will definitely be a treat knowing Francis will be on board for both parts. Never in my life did I expect this movie to be this great in both film terms and as an adaption.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Better than the first... but still very problematic.,"Expectations is something that everyone succumbs to when doing a lot of things, especially when viewing a piece of art for the first time, in particular movies, as due to the film's marketing, cast, director and (in some cases) potential production mishaps, everybody has expectations when seeing a film for the first time, whether it be good or bad. However, it is always important to keep an open mind when watching and not let your expectations dictate your overall judgement of the film. This is what I did when seeing this film. I wasn't the biggest fan of the first, feeling it was badly plotted, poorly written, was obvious in its social commentary and had a main character who I didn't care for. That said, I kept an open mind while watching and overall, while it is better than the first, that isn't saying very much, considering that not only are many of the first film's problems still present, some of them have gotten worse.The first problem is that the film is that is less a sequel but more of a remake of its predecessor, which was already technically a remake of films like The Running Man and Battle Royale. This is highlighted with the amount of plot points that are recycled from the first film. Both films start in Katniss' District of District 12. Both films have an incident which gets the heroes involved with the Hunger Games. Both films have a similarly paced and underwhelming Hunger Games. Both films involve a sequence with obviously fake fire effects. The fact that both films are as similar as they are demonstrates how the lazy the writing is, as it seems that they thought that repeating material would be easier than to create new material.Another example of lazy writing is the obvious social commentary. Like the first film, we are spoon-fed social commentary, but this time it is about the media and celebrity culture, rather than the rich and poor. It discusses how the media (symbolised by the Capitol) form celebrities (symbolised by Katniss and Peeta) personalities and controls their every move, even forcing them to marry, in order to satisfy the public. In a better and more subtle film, this may have been a subtle and interesting commentary on Rupert Murdoch-media and how corrupt it is, but instead due to how painfully obvious it is, it becomes quite boring after a while.I wouldn't mind this lack of subtly if the film was good in other areas. Unfortunately, the film also lacks in characterization, acting and tension. While most of the acting is top-notch, the leads are (like in the first film) lacking with Jennifer Lawrence, despite being slightly better in this film, still sounds more like a bored, whiny and lazy teenager than a tortured, distressed and rebellious young woman and Josh Hutcherson is about as wooden as a tree trunk. It doesn't help that Donald Sutherland is a weak bad guy. Don't get me wrong, he's a brilliant actor, but he isn't an intimidating presence. In scenes when he is threatening Katniss that he'll destroy her District if she doesn't obey the Capitol, he comes off less as an evil dictator, and more of a grandfather who is telling off his granddaughter for behaving badly. In the hands of someone like Tobin Bell or Brian Cox, the role could have been salvaged, but instead Sutherland phones in his performance.The characters are also poorly drawn. Sure there are hints at development, but the film never has the courage to run with them. For example, Katniss has bad dreams about the previous Hunger Games and the violence that happened, but this only happens once. Another example is an attempt to create more chemistry between Katniss and Peeta, but this only happens in 2 or 3 scenes, whose credibility is reduced with corny lines about what Katniss' favourite colour is.It also doesn't help that by the time the Hunger Games begins, they're a major disappointment as the characters fight no humans, but rather baboons, poisonous gases, a rotating island at high speed and crows. Yay. It isn't helped by how easily these enemies are evaded. How are the baboons evaded? They point spears at them, which scares them. How do they fight off the effects of poisonous gases? They roll around in water. How do they stop falling off the quickly rotating island? They just hold onto it. How do they fight off the crows? They don't, as they eventually fly away. There is no tension because of this, and with not threat, bad writing and poor social commentary, what are we left with?Some redeeming features, luckily. The ending for example contains a really good, unexpected twist that makes the rest of the film seem worthwhile (and shows potential for the rest of the franchise, despite the ending feeling a bit abrupt) and many of the other actors are great and the production values (special effects & set design) are improved from the first (albeit the fire effects), showing the signs of a bigger budget. However, when the style of the movie, great performances from the supporting cast rather than the main stars & one twist at the end of the movie are the best parts of this film, it doesn't bode well for the rest of the series.Overall, while the film is better than the first, that doesn't say much. Sure, the ending and production values are great and the supporting cast are fantastic, but the film also has many of the first film's problems (i.e. poor characterization, lack of subtly and bland leads just to name a few) and many of the those problems have gotten worse. Hopefully, Mockingjay parts 1 & 2 will fix this, but for now, this is a huge disappointment that has been over-hyped by critics and audiences alike.

Best film of 2013?,"This is one of the greatest films I have ever seen, and it is especially appealing to me because I had the privilege of seeing it when it premiered in cinemas.I loved it. There's no other way to put it. It was an extremely balanced film, with frequent references to the book and it depicted the book's events perfectly.The cast was impeccably chose. The characters (such as Finnick, Mags etc.)matched descriptions from the book and also matched what I depicted them to be while reading the book.If there was one improvement I need to say, it must be the CGI.

Better than expected - entertaining - improvement on the first one,"So, this is my first review ever and i write it just because of all these negative ones i read here.Actually, i was pretty skeptical about this film because a) I thought the first one was just ""okay"", but sometimes way too cheesy with an obvious lack of depth and b) the new director Apart from that i never read the books and have no emotional commitment to this franchise.Nevertheless, i watched it today, and it's great. Yeah, you could argue that it's too long, or the end may come to abrupt, but i didn't feel either way. Time flew by, the idea of this whole concept remains interesting, while the whole revolution idea gives it an unexpected depth. The performances are all okay, or good, and you especially feel with Katniss, thanks to J. Lawrence. After watching the film, you literally can't wait for the next one, and although the film looses his pace at the end and very much happens in a very short time, its ending remains well enough satisfying. Yeah, you may ask yourself from time to time: ""What? How? Who?"" - but most of these questions are answered within the movie. Its crucial, though, to remember some things from the first installment.All i can say is that i went into this one without any high expectation, and got good, slightly emotional entertaining which builds up massive potential for future films.

Stunning plot possibilities gone to waste,"OK, maybe I exaggerated a little but it is an important piece of information you should have before you watch the movie. I really like the idea behind the Hunger games, but who doesn't. Having not read the books, I expected that the storyteller would lead us, viewers, into this dystopia world and do their best to show the struggle of the main character Catnis and the people around her. To anyone who has seen at least the first movie, it must be crystal clear that an epic fight will follow up so to say, on all fronts. Yet, for 220 minutes, we don't see as much heroism as we would have wished. I blame the prolonged plot, the way too many scenes that try to explain how our characters feel, with less actions and more explaining than necessary. Still the movie isn't bad but you feel like you have some important plot points were rushed through. The dynamics in the camera action and effects isn't what you may have expected. Since I feel the books may be written with more consideration for the one who can praise them, I will read them - at least the third one. Of course, you aren't in your right mind if you have endured through 2 sequels and miss the hopefully happy ending - whether it is happy I don't know, but I will sure find out.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

Can't Miss Katniss,"Hype for a movie can be completely misleading (read Twilight). The first of the Hunger Games movies also wasn't up to the expectations. I only remember the blood shed and shaky cams from that one. This time, I wanted to play safe, so I checked out the credits. And they make the new Hunger Games movie quite credible.Francis Lawrence dons the director's hat for the sequel (even the future ones) to make an adaptation that sports emotional depth and consistent storytelling. Who's Lawrence? As a director he's ventured us into the unknown realms with 'I Am Legend', 'Constantine' & 'Water For Elephants' (Awesome, Awesome & Lovely respectively). This time too he brings along his skills for uninterrupted, no fillers and sensitive storytelling.Living in the limelight post their win in the last year's Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark are again drawn into the arena to their fright to participate in Quarter Quell. This quarter centenary games involves participation of all living winners from each district. Only this time things have changed. People have found hope against the system in Katniss as a beacon. Her victory is showing sparks of revolt all around. Its only in time we will know how the system reacts.The sequel is an overhaul of sensibilities. The fragility and the vulnerability of emotions among the ones who survived the horror of previous games is among the chief elements that were portrayed genuinely. Academy Award winner Simon Beufoy's (for 'Slumdog Millionaire') script is a thorough exercise in a build up to what will become of the revolution. Comparisons can be made with the first part of Harry Potter & The Deathly Hallows which in a similar manner made only the story proceed and build anxiety for the action and showdowns in the sequels.Overall the atmospherics make this movie worth the time. For me, my favorite Hollywood composer James Newton Howard's score supportingly provides the emotional leverage to the scenes. For me it's hard to believe, but I am already waiting for the sequels.

"You feel the burn of effort, albeit it could be slightly brighter","The way the Hunger Games were won displeased President Snow(Sutherland, giving us yet another despicable bad guy), who threatens that the two ""star-crossed lovers"" will have to serve as distraction - to stop the growing rebellion in its tracks. When Gale(Hemsworth, who now gets to take breaks from brood and charm to show what those traits are hiding) hears of the unrest, he is determined to aid it. As more US police - I mean, Peacekeepers(with a redesigned armor that renders them similar to stormtroopers... and I mean Hitlers' as well as The Galactic Empire's) are stationed in the districts and Peeta(Hutcherson, who has time to be more than a somewhat weak, if likable, puppy-dog for our heroine) and Katniss(Lawrence, who drives this ahead with intensity and strength - and shows that when allowed to, she can let her guard down, and there is more to her than prematurely being forced into the role of provider) have to make a fateful decision - will they encourage it? Perhaps even... join it?As a sequel, this does just about everything right. Acknowledging everything in the first(which this outdoes in most ways - the only thing that remains better at is that it didn't omit as many vital details from the source material; frankly, those that go into this without having read the book, or at least a synopsis, will scratch their heads at some pay-offs that were never set up, and the ending half-introduces a key aspect which is literally outright incomprehensible) whilst changing the style slightly, nearly completely eliminating the shaky-cam, not only furthering our returning characters but also developing new and old alike, pulling them out of the purgatory of being relegated to mere archetypes. Right from when you meet Finnick(Claflin, an arrogant ladies' man) and Johanna(Malone, abrasive and snarky, could not give less of a crap), you know who they are as people. Every role is well-cast, and everyone steps up to the challenge of their roles having grown as people and/or been extended.Having to include a lot of details and thematic complexity from the novel(which wasn't confined to a 135 minute running time, not counting end credits), this has numerous little moments that say a ton about what they represent a tiny glimpse into - such as the leading girl's PTSD-like state and various interpersonal relationships, including the much-feared love triangle(that, though expanded, is not focused too much on). While the unfortunate traits of the middle chapter of a trilogy are present, they are easily forgiven. Some cartoonish villainy does detract from an otherwise highly credible depiction of a dictatorship. The world feels real, lived-in over designed, and you are mercilessly placed in it - the arena genuinely capturing the unnatural, lethally crafted and unpredictable quality that it evokes in the written original. Sudden stings of heartbreaking events keep the action-less portions from ever growing stale, and they avoid being cheap tricks by always being followed up on, not being false starts.There is a lot of brutal and disturbing content, and a little blood and violence(pushed far for a PG-13) in this. I recommend this to any fan of satire and survival drama. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Franchise truly catches fire with this excellent adaptation,"Chips falling as they did, the odds of ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" equaling its predecessor were not exactly ever in its favor. Director and adaptor Gary Ross left the burgeoning film franchise, Suzanne Collins' series undoubtedly lost a little luster with its increased exposure and ""Catching Fire"" takes on a much larger scope than the first book as revolution threatens the dystopia of Panem.Well, with Francis Lawrence at the helm (""I Am Legend"") and a screenplay from two Oscar winners in Simon Beaufoy (""Slumdog Millionaire"") and Michael Arndt (""Oblivion,"" ""Toy Story 3""), ""Catching Fire"" makes adapting mega-popular book series look easy. The sequel builds on the tone Ross set for the series while improving upon the action, tension and drama.Beaufoy and Arndt perfectly convey the pressures upon Hunger Games victors Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson). Their act of defiance masquerading as true love allowed them to survive the Games together, but now they must sell it to the districts of Panem in order to fan down the flames of revolution they've kindled, or risk President Snow (Donald Sutherland) and the Capitol hurting the ones they love.""Catching Fire,"" like its predecessor but in a whole other way, is a tale of two parts: the first being Katniss and Peeta's ""Victory Tour"" during which it becomes clear the districts' defiance of the Capitol has gone too far to stop now, and the second being the 75th Hunger Games, which has been manipulated this year to snuff out Katniss for good. Although these parts look and feel totally different, the strong narrative binding them together makes the movie impressively cohesive and doing justice to metaphor in the film's title and at the heart of its story.The biggest difference between the two ""Hunger Games"" films is the stylistic approach of directors Lawrence versus Ross. Ross used a lot of hand-held camera-work whereas Lawrence uses a more standard approach and picks his angles. The action scenes of ""Catching Fire"" are therefore a lot crisper, with no shaky-cam to blur the violence down to PG-13. Lawrence opts to leave a lot of the violence to the viewer's imagination and it's much more effective.On the other hand, Lawrence doesn't seem to have quite the same rapport with the other Lawrence, his star. Ross had a way of capturing Katniss' emotion in a real, deeply introspective way. He made Katniss his focal point, boxing out the supporting characters; Lawrence is more inclusive, sacrificing a little of our lens into Katniss to account for the many new characters in ""Catching Fire."" Some of Jennifer Lawrence's facial expressions don't have the same effective intensity as they did during, for example, the slow-building Reaping scene in the first movie. Katniss has lots of moments in which she emotionally snaps, which puts the pressure on Lawrence to sell us on the emotions, but she's a little limited with how effective she can be.Instead, characters such as Haymitch (Woody Harrelson), Effie (Elizabeth Banks), President Snow and newcomers Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin) and head gamemaker Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) get a little more of a spotlight and make ""Catching Fire"" feel more like an ensemble film. The script also supports them with some good lines and moments. Considering ""Catching Fire"" moves the story in a direction that is bigger than Katniss, it's a smart decision that could pay dividends in the two-part conclusion, ""Mockingjay,"" which underwhelmed as a book.""Catching Fire"" works from start to finish and doesn't waste much screen time in all of its 156 minutes. There's very little action in the first half too, but the trap in which Katniss is ensnared provides the high stakes and the suspense to get the ball rolling. Considering the trailers didn't bother to hide that Katniss returns to the Hunger Games arena once again, it's testament to the work Arndt and Beaufoy have done that the moment when President Snow reveals that information has a heavy and harrowing effect in spite of its inevitability.Adaptations of major book series or multi-film franchises often struggle when the scale of the story grows so large that there's so much more to take account of, but hiring these ace writers and a director with some experience reining in big genre films helped ""Catching Fire"" take a major step forward in a way that can only be compared to the ""Harry Potter"" franchise. If they can make ""Mockingjay"" work despite splitting the tiny and very different book into two parts, that'll be another success entirely.~Steven CThanks for reading!

The most intense and amazing film of the year.,"""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" is the most intense and amazing film of the year. Catching Fire is the sequel to the amazing ""Hunger Games."" This film shows how Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) are, unfortunately, drawn once again to compete in a special 75th Hunger Games and how they are the reason for the rebellion in all the districts. Katniss has given people in the districts hope from her courage and that is brewing up to be a horrible thing for President Snow.What I love about this amazing film is the amazing wardrobe, hair and makeup. The incredible Trish Summerville, costume designer for the film, captures the vision perfectly in turning the book into a movie. Hair and makeup are bold and extravagant as well. I also like how well the cast works together and how well the film turns out overall. I'm a huge fan of the Hunger Games series.My favorite character is Katniss. There are lots of intriguing characters in this movie but what makes Katniss different are her incredible traits - her intelligence and her creativity are just a few. Katniss knows she needs to make alliances to stay alive and she quickly learns skills from them all. Jennifer Lawrence plays an amazing Katniss Everdeen.My favorite scene is when Katniss is on Caesar's talk show and reveals the incredible dress by spinning. The dress transforms from a pure white wedding gown to an incredible black fiery mocking jay dress with wings. It is truly stunning.This movie will make you cry and laugh. You'll just love it. I definitely cannot wait for the next one to come out. I rate this movie 5 out of 5 stars.KIDS FIRST! recommends this movie for ages 12 to 18 because of some of the intense scenes of violence and gore, some suggestive attire and profanity.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Improvement on the First One,"The second installment in the ""Hunger Games"" franchise is an improvement on the first one, with a more compelling story and less thudding direction. The story didn't go where I wanted it to -- I was hoping all of the previous contestants who are called back to fight again would ban together to go into hiding, and they'd all be really good at it because they know how to survive. I was less excited by another fight for survival in the arena, but if I couldn't have what I really wanted, the direction they took the story was a nice compromise.Grade: A-",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
The Cheesy games,"Did I watch a different film from most of the people here? 8.4 average? I mean, come on, are these people saying this is one of the best films ever made?Get real people!I made the mistake of seeing this turkey the day after I saw 'Blue is the Warmest color'. A big mistake. One is full of emotion, the other is full of cheese and sentimentality. One is so real you feel you are there, the other is full of CGI ripped off from the first movie. One has some of the most tender and beautiful acting I've seen in ages, the other is full of cheesy one liners including 'I hope I get to love like that one day'.Hunger Games: Catching Fire is absolutely shocking. Not even Jennifer Lawrence can save it.I loved the first one which felt fresh, ambitious and different. This just felt like scenes left over from the first movie. I also cant emphasis how cheesy this film is, what's with the Hollywood weepy music? I've heard people have cried during this film, all I would say is, get a life. The forced emotion is laughable. Oh, it's also a total snoozebuster, I dozed off twice during the first 20 minutes.By the time it got to the end I (I've not read the books) I was hoping the whole island would explode killing everyone in the process.

The Hunger Games have been upgraded,"""Remember who the real enemy is.""Francis Lawrence (I Am Legend) takes over director duty from Gary Ross in the sequel to The Hunger Games franchise which results in a much darker and better film. I know I gave the original Hunger Games film the same rating as this one, but I think I was a little too generous with the first film. Francis clearly sets the right mood and tone for this franchise by giving us a better picture of the world outside of the games. The districts and the Capitol are better portrayed here and we get a sense of who the real enemy is now. In the first film I felt like the enemies were some of the kids from the first districts, while in this sequel you get more of a sense as to why the Capitol and President Snow are the true enemies. The film takes more time to set up this world and it does so with a great sense of pacing and storytelling. The actual Hunger Games don't begin until the second half of the film, but I was OK with the buildup since it was absolutely necessary. Catching Fire gives us glimpses of what we are going to get in the next two films as sparks of a revolution begin to develop, and it also gives us new characters that are certain to play a key role in the upcoming films. These new characters are far better developed than the ones in the first film and the entire film sets things up perfectly for the grand finale. Jennifer Lawrence carries this film and she truly is a girl on fire showing both sides of her persona: her courage and her vulnerability. She balances these elements and the struggles she's going through perfectly and allows the audience to identify with her character. I don't think that two and a half hours have gone by so quickly for me as it did during this movie (I've seen 90 minute films that seemed to be longer than this) because it was just so exciting and engaging. The action during the actual games were also much better developed (no more shaky cams). Catching Fire is probably along with Star Trek Into Darkness the best blockbuster of the year.Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrece) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), the winners of the 74th Annual Hunger Games, have returned home. Katniss has turned into a symbol of hope for the people who are beginning to rebel against the totalitarian government of the Capitol under President Snow (Donald Sutherland). Katniss and Peeta's return home is short lived as they embark on a Victor's Tour around all the districts paying their respects to the falling tributes. Despite Katniss's love for Gale (Liam Hemsworth), she is forced to continue with the farce surrounding the media coverage of her relationship with Peeta. Effie (Elizabeth Banks) and Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) join Katniss and Peeta as advisers during the tour. President Snow recognizes that Katniss has become a symbol of hope for the people outside of the Capitol and therefore has a surprise for the upcoming Quarter Quell (the 75th Annual Hunger Games). He announces that for this special event a male and female tribute winner from every district will have to compete against each other in this tournament of champions. Katniss and Peeta are the chosen tributes from District 12 who will face other tributes in a special arena designed by the new Head Gamemaker, Plutarch Heavensbee (Phillip Seymour Hoffman). Other tributes include Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin) and Johanna Mason (Jena Malone) who form an alliance with them. President Snow is planning on crushing Panem's new symbol of hope, but Katniss will do what it takes to survive and protect her loved ones.Francis Lawrence does a much better job here at exploring the different themes that the film is trying to get across. Catching Fire is more than a simple survival tale as other themes such as government oppression, heavily marked social classes, and society's obsession with celebrities are all explored very well. The characters are better developed as well. Take Katniss for example, as she's forced to live a double life feeling hypocritical and imprisoned at times as she has to hide her true feelings for Gale. She doesn't feel like a hero and doesn't want to be that symbol of hope that's she become. She has to come to grips with her new identity and the responsibility that has come with it. Jennifer Lawrence delivers a strong performance as she shows these inner struggles she's facing while at the same time proving she can be lethal. The film is also very well adapted by Simon Beaufoy (Slumdog Millionaire) and Michael Arndt (Toy Story 3) from Suzanne Collins' novel. The returning supporting actors like Lenny Kravitz and Stanley Tucci are phenomenal once again, while the new characters played by Jenna Malone, Sam Claflin, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and Jeffrey Wright have sparked my interest as to what they can bring to this franchise. They were all very well developed and add so much to a first part which in my opinion was dependent entirely on Jennifer Lawrence. She carries this film once again, but has an even more impressive supporting cast to leave us even more hooked with the cliffhanger ending. This film was great and I haven't even mentioned the amazing sets and awesome costume designs that went up a notch from last year's Hunger Games. Catching Fire is an upgrade over the original film and one you should definitely give a chance.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Series Catching Fire,"This movie certainly has the series starting to catch fire as things heat up in a very good way. This is actually one of the better sequels where it stands up to the original and even is better in some ways. The concept of the 75 anniversary and having all the champions compete was very fun and the story line beyond that was great. While this years Hunger Games unfolded, a bigger theme with the rebellion is forming and it was cool to see that happening throughout. I think this was a great step for the series and one that I really enjoyed. IMDb needs to relax with these character minimums though.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

Lesser sequel to the original Hunger Games movie...,"1st watched 11/22/2013 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Francis Lawrence): Lesser sequel to the original Hunger Games movie doesn't have the bite or allure of the original. The setup and lead-in to the games is very flat and sometimes downright corny. The viewer also doesn't see the purpose behind everything that is happening as clearly as with the original. There is really nothing terribly wrong in the performances with Jennifer Lawrence in the lead as Kat, but the direction doesn't seem to pull in the emotions or necessity for the story. The main characters emotions are very evident – almost too much so – but the other characters are pretty bland as far as their direction towards their purpose. The story starts with Kat being called out of her hunter's life to leave her current boyfriend to go on a victor's tour with her winner & co-partner for her zone – which quickly becomes a tournament to cover up the actual turmoil and possible revolution in the real world. The game provides a little bit of puzzle solving as it is setup like a clock, but not enough to make it very interesting or much fun. There is a hardness to this movie that is actually pretty tough to take in – a world that makes the normal folk kill each other as entertainment for some reason that is not real clear. Overall this is a just a pretty un-satisfactory movie experience for a franchise that promises at least two more movies.hopefully they pick up their game or it will lose it's audience despite the book series popularity.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
It was very well adapted. Can't understand why people disliked it.,"All the actors in the movie were great, and the movie follows the book pretty well. In fact, it enhances some of the scenes in comparison to the book. There are only two major things changed from the book to the movie. One is understandable while I wish the other would have been present in the movie. I will not spoil anything, but if you've read the book, I'm referring to the Mockingjay watch. It should have been a present symbol in the movie.Some users have expressed the movie is just a lead into the next one and lacked action, but part of that is what happens when you have a trilogy. Going from book one to book three without there being some sort of justification would have dulled out the story. Also, I felt there was way more action in comparison to the first book/movie. Every single act coming from Katniss and everyone surrounding her carries more weight. There are more dangers in every place (home, capital, etc.) and consequently, much more at stake.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Descent Depiction of the Second Novel,"The movie overall was pretty entertaining, but to me missed the ""wow"" factor. I must admit, I have read the books but I am not considered a hard core fan of the lore. I think they did a descent job of trying to adapt a lot of detail in one book. I feel however, they went through the game too fast. The original game was much more complex and entertaining. It was probably due to not straining time that they skipped some of those parts.Unlike the first movie, this is really about the depiction of the Hunger Games universe with the showing of the districts and how the government works. The actual game that is depicted towards the end of the movie is simply the result in every sense of the word to the events of the first half of the movie.Pretty good movie... ending actually did give a surprise. I think its because it happened faster than i thought it would. I wish Thad from Blue Mountain State had a cooler part though.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Better than the first outing,"Anyone else get the sense Jennifer Lawrence and Woody Harrelson are kind of slogging through this one? It may be just be and actorly attempt to emote fatigued resignation at once again being brought into the game to kill tributes but the two leads do give off done- with-this-can't-believe-I-signed-on-to-3-sequels-vibe. By contrast Josh Hutcherson shows eagerness given he has the same career prospects as the kid who played Ron Weasley in the Harry Potter series. The recently (and tragically) departed Philip Seymour Hoffman and Donald Sutherland appear only to give the proceedings prestige - their unremarkable parts could have been played by unknowns just as effectively. Having said that, seeing these folk join Lenny Kravitz in the same movie is still a treat. While the story they act in makes no mathematical sense. The Capitol needs 24 former victors minus the 2 (Katniss & Peeta) who won last year leaving 22 spots taken from the field of 74 previous winners. However, we know from this installment the youngest winner ever was 14 meaning the youngest winner otherwise must have been 15. Assuming a life expectancy of 75 years we can deduct 15 years old from 74 previous winners and assume only 59 remain alive. Choosing 22 of these at random leaves a resulting set of participants aged a minimum of 17 (15 year old winner minimum + at least 2 years ago) to a maximum of 73 (15 year old winner + up to 58 contests ago). The effects of the random draw (assuming no one would volunteer as tribute having managed to survive it once) would result in a contestant pool spanning most of that range. The movie does show one old woman contestant who has no lines and suffers the indignity of riding another contestant (there really are no good parts of older actresses). Putting the math aside the ""moves-counter moves"" focus of the script as opposed to dwelling so much on the action adventure does make for more intriguing proceedings compared to the first film adaptation of the Suzanne Collins book. The jarring ending makes this the ""Empire Strikes Back"" of the trilogy+1 but it does set up the forthcoming film nicely.In short, improved sophistication of story overcomes a decline in acting to produce an entertaining outing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
A better exploration of the world set up in the first film,"Coming hot off the heels of the first film (which I did not love), I actually really liked its sequel, Catching Fire. (Which now that I think about it, I do recall enjoying the second book more than the first) While I do not think it would've been a strong standalone film, it does pay off a lot of the thematic questions and feelings I had coming off of the first film. The world is explored so much deeper, and the general ""huh, these games seem like a really bad idea and reflect poorly on humanity if they were ever implemented,"" is explored to a satisfying degree and I think that strength lies in both how incredibly evil President Snow is and also in the characterization of the other competitors that are not named Katniss and Peeta.Each of these Hunger Games All-Stars-through the writing, through the acting-you really get the sense that they have lives and it's heartbreaking that every single one of them has to enter this ""kill or be killed"" pageant. I think this installment was better paced than its predecessor and I was able to have more fun with it-though I will say, Katniss's ""complex"" attitude toward Peeta was more confusing to me than intriguing. I still don't really get what the film was trying to say about that relationship.The ending was very obviously a sequel hook, which I do think makes the final few minutes suffer. With a more satisfying ending to this story as its own thing, I definitely think this would have been something genuinely great. Otherwise, it's a fun installment in a franchise with an intriguing premise that was explored well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

A solid and serviceable sequel to the Hunger Games,"I had written that the first movie left me with an empty feeling in terms of what was served up as I wanted more than what was given to me and some of the void from that was filled with Catching Fire which is a more than serviceable sequel to the original Hunger Games. Just when you thought that Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson)had graduated from the whole Hunger Games experience, think again as they are now thrust right back into the action after completing their little ""victory tour"" in an effort to keep the rebellious population in tow. It was definite improvement from the first film as it is better in just about every way, from improved character development to better special effects and better acting from not just the new members of the cast including Sam Claflin, Jena Malone, Amanda Plummer, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Jeffrey Wright but also from returning cast members Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland, Elizabeth Banks and Stanley Tucci. They were all good in their own way but if I had to single out individuals here, it would be Woody Harrelson who gives a better performance this time around as more of his character is explored and gives an understated performance here, Donald Sutherland who thrives on more screen time than in the previous film, showing us that he is the brutal dictator of Panem and that he will get his way, his scenes with the granddaughter are well done and Philip Seymour Hoffman who is always a treat to watch him hone his craft and who plays one of the more complex individuals in the film as there seems to be more than meets the eye with his character but then again, that he is what he is known for, just blending in to his environment like a true character actor attempts to do. In terms of the leads, Lawrence and Hutcherson's chemistry goes up a notch from the first movie as they have shown more matureness and their coupling seems more and more believable as the film goes on. So if this is anything to go by, the sequels should be just as impressive. Positives for the movie include, once again, the chemistry between the two leads, the supporting cast of which some I have notably highlighted as well as the film feeling more mature and darker than the first one and some negatives could be Liam Hemsworth and his chemistry with Lawrence but in fairness I might give him the benefit of the doubt as that may be the fault of the screenwriter here, a couple of characters looking like passengers- say for example the guy who plays Commander Thread as he had shown a little bit of promise but ultimately that promise disappeared. Overall, a solid sequel and worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

They've put every important scenes and even a slice of modification on specific things that Gary Ross didn't do correctly (I am talking about Buttercup the cat and even Madge).

A rare sequel that surpasses the original,"Catching Fire will take its place alongside other legendary movie sequels that outdid their original (The Empire Strikes Back, Lord of the Rings: the Two Towers, The Godfather Part 2 and others).The author of the series, Suzanne Collins, has said that she came up with the idea for the trilogy while channel surfing. She said she saw a reality show where contestants get voted off along side real footage of Middle Eastern violence and she said ""Why not combine the two?"" Much of the original was spent setting the scene and context for the reaping and for a future America divided into 12 districts. ""Catching Fire"" immediately jumps into Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Melaark's world as they try to come to some sort of normalcy post victory. As such, it's a movie that's highly recommended but only if you have seen the first movie or have at least read the book.All of the memorable characters return from the first movie though this time they've been pumped up several megawatts on the ""over the top"" scale. Caesar and Effie in particular set new heights for wardrobe outrageousness.And of course, the wicked President Snow returns, so wonderfully realized by Donald Sutherland. This time he's angered by Katniss and Peeta and desperate to stifle the hope and rebellion of all the citizens of Panem. To that end he proposes a twist on the Quarter Quell for the Hunger Games, that all the tributes will come from a pool of previous victors.The Quarter Quell brings up the main instance where ""Catching Fire"" outshines the original. In the first movie, many of the tributes were ordinary youngsters tossed into the killing arena. Most of them were painted in broad, one-dimensional strokes. ""Catching Fire"" introduces the exciting characters Finnick (portrayed stunningly by Sam Claflin) and Johanna (Jena Malone), among others.Novel adaptation purists will appreciate that very little was altered or sensationalized from the translation of book to cinema. And ""Catching Fire"" manages to end in an exciting way that ties up loose ends but at the same time stokes the fires for the resolution (Mockingjay).",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Shouldn't be top 10...,"The movie I picked that did do well in the box office but kind of shocked me that it was so high was The Hunger Games: Catching Fire. I loved the Hunger Games series, loved the books more, but regardless, loved the movie. It comes in at number 10 on the All-Time USA Box office in- between E.T. and Pirates of the Caribbean. While I loved the movie I don't think it was good enough to be in the number 10 spot. The top two movies on the list are Avatar and Titanic, two movies that earned that spot by being fairly advanced for the time they were made, which brought in a lot of people to see it. There was no spectacular special effects in the Hunger Games: Catching Fire, and while the story behind it was creative it became boring at some points and predictable to people who didn't read the books. I think the reason it is number 10 is because of the well known actors and the fact that it was a book first. If it wasn't for them, I highly believe it wouldn't have been as successful as it is now.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"a brilliantly made, well-paced, compelling sci-fi action drama thriller","Despite from a young adult novel similar to Twilight, Beautiful Creatures, Mortal Instruments, or Percy Jackson, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire proved to be a brilliantly made, well-paced, compelling sci-fi action drama thriller that's well surpassed the first film, and dare I say, even better than any of the recent young adult novel-to-film adaptations out there.The film spends the first half of the film to explore and develop its thought-provoking themes: totalitarianism (more specifically fascism, extreme far right of the political spectrum), inequality and class warfare, oppression,the abuse of social media and political manipulation eventual uprising and revolution, hope, courage and sacrifice, the psychological consequences of taking human lives. These are the thematic elements that make this film stand out among others.Moreover, the film further addresses the personal feelings of the hunger games victors in the aftermath of the games in the first film...how they feel as a result of killing others. The film also takes time to further develop the love triangle relationship between Katniss, Gale and Peeta...Although Katniss' feelings with Gale (childhood sweetheart) remains unchanged, it is noticeable that Katniss really cared about Peeta and starting to fall in love with him as the film progresses. The entire film comes across as far more complex, heartfelt than its predecessor.At the young age of 23, Jennifer Lawrence managed to pull out such a great performance to carry the film and letting the audience feel emotionally engaged throughout the film. Although the scope of the film is getting bigger, the film never ceases to focus on Katniss' feelings, about how she deals with the situation. The set (jungle arena) and costume designs were amazing this time around as they get a bigger budget (Jennifer looks good in the 'wedding' dress)However, the film does have its flaws. most of the thrills of the tournament are left out in order to develop the story. We don't get to really know the contestants in detail (other than they're the previous champions of the games), they're just there to be eventually killed by others due to the tight-writing of the tournament. It is not further explained in the film either on why some participants willing to sacrifice their lives in order to save others whom they barely know (possibly for the greater good as they now become a symbol of hope for the districts?).Furthermore, the shaky-cam filming for some of the action scenes hurts the film as well.As mentioned in the title, this film is truly 'catching fire', exceeds expectations and further promises an epic conclusion near the end of the film. Now, I'm really excited and looking forward to see how Mockingjay is going to be adapted into two films (Part 1 & 2) to provide a satisfying conclusion to the series.Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
A Cetinich Review (#1 - Cathing Fire): Don't Always Trust An IMDb Rating,"To begin with, I've read The Hunger Games books and absolutely loved them. It was thrilling and there was a twist at the end of each chapter, which made you want to read on. The first Hunger Games movie was OKAY - it didn't refer to the book a lot but still had its fair share of action scenes and reasonable acting.I waited a whole year for Catching Fire, and when it came out I couldn't wait to see it - my expectations were high ... even before I saw the IMDb rating of 8.2. I walked into the theatre, took my seat and watched. When the movie came to an end, I just shook my head and left.The Hunger Games: Catching Fire felt very rushed - even for a two and a half hour movie. The first hour was a lot of nothingness (to me anyway). When they got into the arena, I hoped the action would save the movie, but unfortunately, it made it worse.The action scenes were rushed, they figured a lot of the issues out very quickly and there was far too many ""near-death"" moments for Peeta.If there was one thing that saved this movie, it would have to be Jennifer Lawrence's acting. She's very good at what she does, and she is most definitely a rising star in the movie industry.Hopefully the next two Hunger Games movies won't be as bad. Catching Fire was a rushed movie, with boring action scenes but reasonable acting. And come to think of it, I don't think I even saw the title screen at the beginning of the movie to say what the movie was called. Someone sat in front of me said to himself, ""this isn't Prisoners,"" and left.Acting: 7/10Action: 5/10Writing: 4/10Setting: 6/10Overall Rating: 5.5",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
A supposedly action fantasy,"The first instalment of this series became a success and a phenomenon largely due to the struggle that was put up by the main character in order to survive as well as conveying the moral that 'it is wrong to kill' even if it is part of the rules.So, given that the ""games"" were so pivotal to this film why the makers of the movie wasted over 80 minutes of the audience's time before we were treated to any action? All this mumbo jumbo background gibberish made this for a largely dull experience. When a film is by definition a fantasy/action all this attempt to slowly build a subplot and explore additional mechanisms is in vain. Not to mention the constant switch from seeing our characters as powerful and able to effect change, were then deemed helpless pawns. So what were they?Lack of imagination and creativity is what lacked in this film. The first instalment was also not entirely to my liking, but it offered plenty of thrills and a fine spectacle.When the long overdue action did arrive, it was just too little too late and any enthusiasm for the upcoming sequels, has largely diminished.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Not bad... but not good,"I am all for suspension of belief, but it's a bit tough to get into the whole plot of The Hunger Games. The whole idea of the entire human race being okay with watching people and kids kill each other, come on - Yet everyone loves Katniss, our favorite polyandrist. Part of the problem is I couldn't ever find myself rooting for her, I don't know if it's Lawrence or the character; but I didn't find either likable, I found myself rooting more for Peeta and Finnick. Going into it, the majority of the movie feels pointless and when the games actually do start, it's something we've already seen, a reverse slasher - except you know who wins. To its credit, it does get better towards the end and I thought this one was better than the first. However, between Stanley Tucci in the ridiculous purple wig, the baboon attack, and Lenny Kravitz's glittery eyeliner, you would think the plot itself could not be the most cringeworthy thing about the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
A downgrade from the first film.,"A dystopian future run by a magalomaniacal dictator who makes young people fight to the death in gladiatorial like contests.That's a great idea for a film and it is the reason why I loved The Hunger Games (2012). I went into this one with really high expectations.The Hunger Games: Catching Fire started really well. Darker than the first film and displaying more government oppression as well as the seeds of a revolution, it is certainly an interesting concept. The build-up to the games is done well and the stakes are upped in a simple but brilliant way: past winners are made to fight each other.Unfortunately, the film starts falling apart when the games start. There are three main problems with the film:1) Most of the contestants are never properly introduced so it is hard to care for them when they start to die.2) In a gladiatorial film, the audience wants to see contestants fighting and killing each other. Here, the contestants don't really fight each other, rendering the gladiatorial aspect of the film meaningless. Instead, the contestants spend most of their time battling the weather and other natural calamities.3) The ending was abrupt, lame and left me feeling cold. It was more of a ruse to get people to the next film than a satisfying ending to this one.Overall, The Hunger Games series has some really good ideas but in this outing, the film went pear-shaped halfway through.Special mention goes to Philip Seymour Hoffman who lights up the screen whenever he appears and to Jennifer Lawrence who is still wonderful as Katniss Everdeen but the film doesn't gel and has too many flaws.I give it a 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Catching Fire is a great movie that manages to do everything much better than the original.,"Catching Fire is the highly anticipated sequel to The Hunger Games. Obviously. Now, I must say, The Hunger Games series is one of my favorite book series. They're well written, intense, and just downright cool. As for the first Hunger Games movie, I enjoyed it too; however, I do like the book better. I was excited for Catching Fire and my hopes were high. Was it as good as the original Hunger Games movie? No. No it wasn't. It was BETTER! LEGASP! Let's start off with the story. If you have no idea what The Hunger Games movies/books are about, then A: you live under a rock, and B: it involves a society where the government forces kids to go into a yearly tournament where they kill each other. Catching Fire is about the tributes revolting against the government in a tournament where all the previous victors are fighting each other. In the book series, Catching Fire was my favorite. And it translates very well to the big screen. It's got an interesting plot, it's well written, and it really shows us what a society of this caliber is like. Just awesome. Not the actual society, the story. The story is awesome. Yeah. The acting in this movie is great. Let's start off with Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss. She's awesome. She's very stoic, yet becomes emotional and/or ready to throw down when she needs to. Katniss is just an awesome character and Jennifer Lawrence owns the role. And she's kind of good looking. That helps too. She's also surrounded by other good actors. Josh Hutcherson does a good job, Liam Hemsworth does a great job, Elizabeth Banks does a great job, Woody Harrelson does a great job, Philip Seymour Hoffman does a great job, and the guy who plays President Snow (I forgot his name, shut up) did a great job. There isn't a weak link in any of the acting. Catching Fire fixed some of the flaws that The Hunger Games had. One of them is the shaky cam. The first movie had so much camera shaking in it, it got me extremely nauseous and I had to leave the theater. This movie has a very still camera most of the time. It helped me see the action and the people better. Thank you, new director! Something else this movie fixed from the first is the chemistry between Katniss and Peeta. In the first movie, their chemistry felt very stale and unbelievable. In this movie, it feels real. They worked great together in this movie. However, there are a few things that I need to address for this movie. This isn't really a negative; it's just a heads up. Before you see the movie, I'd suggest reading the book, if you haven't. There are some things in the movie that will make much more sense if you read the book. Plus, if you haven't read it, you'll think the ending will be very abrupt. Again, it's not a negative; I'm just letting you know. A negative that I have with the movie is that there's no wow factor. There isn't a scene that really stands out. Sure, the acting's great, the actions intense, and the movie itself is well shot, but there's no scene that will make you say, ""Wow. This movie is epic."" I was just hoping there would be a standout performance somewhere. I also feel that the movie pretty much ignored Haymitch's backstory. In the book, Haymitch had a long, elaborate backstory on how he entered The Hunger Games and won. In the movie, it mentions it a couple of times, but never goes into real detail. It's too bad, because Haymitch has a great backstory. Oh well Overall, Catching Fire is a great movie that's marginally better than the first. It has great acting, awesome action, no shaky cam, and an interesting plot. I have high hopes for this movie series and hope the Mockingjay movies succeed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
A captivating sequel that raises the stakes,"Cathing fire is a strong follow-up to the original hunger games film, building on its strengths and delivering a more intense and engaging experience.The story delves deeper into the dystopian world of Panem, with higher stakes and more complex character dynamics.The arena scenes are thrilling and visually impressive, and the plot twists keep the audience on their toes. Watching it in the cinema was an immersive experience; the tension was palpable, and you felt genuinely invested in the characters' fates.The performances are compelling, particularly Jennifer Lawrence, who brings depth and nuance to Katniss.

Incredible!,"The first one was very good but this one blew me away! Catching Fire is my favorite book in the series and one of my favorite books ever so I had even higher hopes for this one and I was not disappointed. This one is also very faithful to the source material and that is very good. Actors are as great as always and the story is much more intense now. While Ross' directing was good in the first one and gave a more realistic feel, I prefer the new director, Francis Lawrence. Everything looks better and it feels like a much bigger thing and there are also some very good shots. The visuals are stunning and the arena part is very well done and will keep you at the edge of your seat. Some people will complain that the first half is slow, but it's really important in building up the second half. You get to know all the consequences left by the previous one and look deeper in Capitol and rebellion. The second half is when things start to really move. Rebellion becomes bigger and bigger, we meet some new characters and then it becomes non-stop action. Then there's the twist ending that will totally leave you hanging and you will really want to know what happens next. If you liked the first one, you will love this one!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Orwell light, Twilight dark or something much more?","Catching Fire is a massive step up for the Hunger Games. I had a lot of problems with the first film and although I still have issues with its successor they are nowhere near as substantial and actually Catching Fire does a lot to remedy its predecessor's pit-falls. At two and a half hours Catching Fire is a long film by any standard, however, the story is compact and the dead weight is little to none. The story shoots off; sprinting to that Cornucopia like the long running time doesn't matter. Ironically, it's a long time till we get to that watery Cornucopia but that's another point.One of my main problems with The Hunger Games was the lack of character, or more importantly the lack of development and even more importantly a space for the audience and characters to breathe. Catching Fire still runs at the same break neck speed but for the most part it considers its characters more; respecting the audience by giving Peta real emotion instead of a card board cut out grin and a sappy sore leg that the reluctant Katniss has to make better. I liked Peta in this picture, and I understood both his and Gale's plight more. The triangle is there and in my opinion it works. Catching Fire gives a lot more of its time to the romance, a romance which could if not handled with care become tired and old. However, unlike the Twilight series, for example, the romance between Katniss and Peta and Katniss and Gale is much more woven into the story. The teen love triangle is not the centre of the film, it is an important part which adds to the stakes, emotion and story but it is not the heart.For the full review check out kierankingfilm.blogspot.co.uk",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Unforgettable,"All those people who are saying it's rubbish really need to get checked out, however I do think the hunger games Is not a film for every body. I am a big fan of the hunger games and no it's not because of the co-star. I watched this film 3 times at the cinemas I thought it was a really good film a bit slow at the beginning but it was a film that left me thinking about it for weeks. This film played on my mind probably because of the ending it really made me begging for more. Jennifer Lawrence is an amazing actress and so is woody Harrelson which made the film even better. The little twist at the end really made me think and made me realize how good the film was. It's a film that looks so fun to be in and a film I can never forget. Like I said it's not for everyone and I do think people are not giving it enough credit. This film was quite sad in parts which really brought on emotion especially with the amazing music by James Newton Howard. Give this film a try because I really can't describe how it made me feel.

"Well, the odds were in my favor.","With most sequels, you expect it to be not as good as the first. To tell you the truth, that's what I thought at first when the trailers popped up on IMDb. When I went to see it, I saw it opening day and I played hooky with my mother, older brother, little brother and little sister. My initial reaction was, ""It was good"" I was really confused about my opinions for about a day or 2 and I then realized, it was better than the first. So then 2 days later me and some friends went to see it (this being my second time). And now my opinions came full circle.The plot is just like the book, except some things from the book is dropped. The scenery is beautiful and I think because the movie was filmed in 4k H.D. (4k is roughly 4 times better then 1080p H.D.) A lot more emotion was in the movie. A great soundtrack, Lots of thrills, action, suspense and there was a bit more comedic relief in this movie. Which I think helps the overall feel of the movie when you come out of watching it. The only things I thought were negative, some of the characters were still flat, but that doesn't affect the movie for me.While the movie was great, the book was still better, but this movie I believe was better than the first movie.

"Good, but nothing compared to the book.","I'm not going to sit and complain about how the book is much better because that is a given, in a book you have a lot more time to tell the story.

But if you really want to get into the story I suggest the book, or as I did with the first film, watch the film and then read the book, it makes everything a lot better. The acting however is well done and so is the visual effects, it still looks nice, a much bigger improvements on the first films in terms of CGI.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
A Solid Sequel That is At Least As Good As the First!,"I gave this a 9 out of 10. When the nearly 2 hours and 30 minutes of movie time were up, I was expecting more. It isn't that it ended horribly, it is mostly because I never read the books and this is all new to me. Basically it ended to where the next two movies will be the conclusion.The plot was great but there is some original factor missing because the movie felt similar to the first. It isn't that it is a bad thing but it is more of a Matrix Reloaded than a Terminator 2 as far as original, groundbreaking material if that makes sense.The special effects were extraordinary as usual and the other characters outside the stars were great. Another thing that was missing was that emotional element I guess. While there were some scenes that made you feel for the characters, I think the first Hunger Games made you really care about some of the other contenders.Overall, this movie was a solid 9 and Jennifer Lawrence as usual lives up to expectations. My biggest issue was that when it ended, I didn't think it was over yet if you know what I mean.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"""Out of the Pan: Into the Fire""","Good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.This is a great survivalist story in a horrible setting (wonderfully set, written to be a horrible world).We get all the great fun that we got from the original movie, and then we add in the whole (spoiler) element. It's really what makes the movie and leads us into the next arc, but I won't mention it.With Snow just on an angry tantrum spree (literally using childish tantrum words) you can tell very early that he's defeated himself, it's just a matter of time.Jennifer Lawrence is a big enough personality to carry the movie and she does with everyone else playing support roles centered around her. It was fantastic to see Jena Malone come on board as I feel she adds something special to everything she's in.If you can stand the battle royale concept, this this is a good watch for you.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Terrible,"My friend and I walked out. .1) Poor writing (on par with 4 out of 5 Hollywood movies these days).This includes poor character development, unnatural dialogue, and a boring plot with no explanation of the world or characters (similar to the first, which I almost turned off). No explanation of the previous movie. (My friend hadn't seen the first. Even I saw the first and felt the dialogue was assuming too much).2) Length - It felt like a first draft everyone was too afraid to edit down (and switch around). A shorter film (around 90 minutes) means a more concise story, and money left over in the budget to improve everything overall. From a business perspective, keeping people in their seats longer has no benefits in making the film money. Quantity does not equal quality.3) Instead of trying to challenge or educate young people or teens (their target audience) about the world and politics by providing an intelligent story, they are doing the opposite.Writing is the essence, which holds everything together and gives purpose. It is the mind of the film and the rest is the body. No amount of excellent sound, cinematography, good looking actors, special effects, or creative costumes can mask a poorly written or shallow story.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Even better than the original,"A solid sequel with top-notch acting and impressive special effects (improvise on the first one quite a bit with some scenes). Perfectly cast, builds on the world set up in the first Hunger Games and even builds on the book material so, so, so well!
Interesting twists and turns. Great suspension and emotion - I think it's worthy to note that even though I have read all the books and knew what was going to happen, I was sitting on the proverbial edge of my seat with the tension, suspense, and the mystery.

The only great sequel to the original Hunger Games.,"Catching Fire perpetuates itself to be 'The Empire Strikes Back' of the Hunger Games canon, and on that front I can say it definitely succeeds there: the set-pieces are bigger the perils are raised to the next level and the baddies are hell-bent on destroying the last remnants of hope remaining in Panem.The first of three sequels to the original film, Catching Fire is far and wide the most beautifully shot of the franchise thanks to its utilisation of 35mm and IMAX-65mm celluloid cameras that makes the images on-screen wonderfully realised and applies the scope and scale of the action sequences. It makes you feel like the action is something monumental to behold.As far as sequels go, is this the best one ever made? No, but it's definitely up there for sequels from the 2010s, easily ranking on near-equal footing with other sequels like Skyfall and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Sparks of Rebellion,"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a compelling sequel that elevates the franchise, offering a gripping blend of character-driven drama, political intrigue, and high-stakes action. While the series as a whole may not redefine the dystopian genre, this instalment stands out as a particularly strong entry, delivering a richly layered narrative and memorable performances.The film picks up in the aftermath of Katniss and Peeta's victory in the 74th Hunger Games, diving into the escalating political unrest in Panem and the consequences of their defiance. Jennifer Lawrence shines as Katniss Everdeen, portraying her as a reluctant yet resilient symbol of rebellion. Lawrence's performance captures the emotional complexity of a character burdened by trauma and thrust into a role far larger than herself, solidifying her as the emotional core of the series.The supporting cast enhances the film's impact, with Josh Hutcherson delivering a heartfelt performance as the steadfast Peeta, and Woody Harrelson bringing gravitas and dry wit to the role of Haymitch. New additions to the ensemble, such as Sam Claflin as the charming and enigmatic Finnick Odair, add depth and dynamism to the story, enriching the stakes of the Quarter Quell and expanding the world of Panem.Visually, Catching Fire is striking, with improved special effects and production design that bring the oppressive beauty of the Quarter Quell arena to life. Francis Lawrence's direction is a significant step forward, with tighter pacing, heightened tension, and more polished action sequences that surpass those of the first film. James Newton Howard's evocative score further enhances the narrative, underscoring key moments with emotional resonance and intensity.While the franchise doesn't venture far from the established conventions of dystopian fiction, Catching Fire succeeds in exploring deeper themes of resistance, sacrifice, and the manipulative nature of power. The film's emphasis on the symbolic and psychological aspects of rebellion lends it a sense of urgency and relevance that transcends its genre roots.In conclusion, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a standout chapter in the series, blending compelling performances, polished visuals, and thought-provoking themes to create an engaging and impactful film. It may not revolutionise the genre, but it captures the spirit of defiance and survival with enough heart and sophistication to leave a lasting impression. For fans and newcomers alike, it remains one of the most accomplished entries in the franchise and a film worth revisiting.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Every revolution begins with a spark...,"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, the second installment in the Hunger Games series following Kaniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark after they spark a rebellion when winning the hunger games. These events lead Panem's leader President Snow to gather the victors from previous games to be drawn and entered into a whole new arena where they must fight till the death a second time. Catching Fire is a chilling thrill ride with more twists and suspense as the movie introduces new characters, a rising rebellion, and a whole new plan to take down Panem and their twisted games. Catching Fire may be the best of the films as it takes you deeper into this dystopian society reminding everyone to remember who the enemy is.""People are looking to you, Katniss. You've given them an opportunity. They just have to be brave enough to take it.""

"Spectacular acting, screen writing and set/design","What a pleasant surprise this movie turned out to be. The first one ""The Hunger Games"" was decent but a little disappointing when compared to the book, but this 2nd one more than makes up for it! I experienced a whirlwind of emotions which intimately connected me to the characters (especially Katniss). Great job by every actor who pretty much gave it everything they had!! In my opinion, their performances have raised the bar and set a new standard in quality and genuineness!! The storyline and character development and relationships has more substance and believability than the first. The costume, hair and make up designs are meticulously detailed, imaginative and ingenious.

A Masterpiece.,"I've seen this movie three times in the theater now, and there isn't a single scene that ceases to amaze me. Jennifer Lawrence is perfect for the role as Katniss, she portrays the character perfectly, so does Woody Harrelson, and Josh Raddnor. Although i liked the first Hunger Games too, Cathcing Fire had a way bigger budget, and promised to follow the books more than they did in the first movie. Which it did. I highly suggest go seeing this movie, even if you aren't a Hunger Games fan, you won't regret it. The CGI on the IMAX screens are ridicoulously good, and due to the stories proggresion towards the end, you NEED to see mockingjay part one when it comes out. I for sure will.10/10 Best movie of 2013, along with The Desolation of Smaug.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
boring movie,"Totally don't understand why people give this movie such a high rate. Most boring movie i ever watched in this year. I know this movie is trying to express a lot insights, controlling, love, friendship or whatever. But, obviously, at least i don't go to threat to learn a lesson, i go to theater to have fun. First hour, totally make me feel asleep. Game started after 1.15 hour and only last like 25 minutes. A lot strange person wear strange cloth, didn't find any beauty about that. Wedding dress is pretty though. Give this movie 2 points instead of 1 is because the actress played a good role, at least she expressed her emotion pretty well, though she is not pretty",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is Phenomenal With No Regrets!,"I have been waiting for The Hunger Games: Catching Fire ever since the first film was released! I've watched all the movie trailers, listened to all of the songs from the soundtrack, even written my own song for the film, and even bought a mocking jay pin! I was really nervous about seeing this film, different director usually means lots of changes! I was afraid that Francis Lawrence was going to ""freestyle"" Catching Fire and not reference the book like the first director did, but I can say without holding back that, FRANCIS LAWRENCE KILLED IT!!!The directing was amazing! The cinematography was incredible! The script was real! The acting was SPECTACULAR!!! Costume, ON POINT and STUNNING!!! Katniss's wedding dress and entrance fire dress was BEAUTIFUL! FIERCE! and SEXY! Effie's costumes..HILARIOUS!!! This film definitely had me entertained throughout the entire film!But, there were some rather intense moments in the film. But, i mean it in the best way possible! Francis Lawrence deserves an A+ for suspense! Jennifer Lawrence deserves an Oscar nomination for her raw performance! The entire cast, including the extras, were INCREDIBLE! The Hunger Games: Catching Fire dropped my jaw at least twice! Right when you think it's going to all be fine and good, everyone's walking away...BOOM!!! Francis Lawrence definitely did not hold back, and neither did Jennifer Lawrence.With the new director also came some new Visual Effects! I really was proud of the VFX team on this film, they took it to a whole new level! The modeling and texturing was amazing and realistic, and THE FIRE was FIRE!!! In the first film, the fire didn't really look like fire. I'm very pleased that they improved on the realism of the flames on her dress. The arena was beautiful, as if it had been pulled straight out of the book! And even the SFX make up artist did an amazing job!The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is thrilling throughout, it WILL keep you at the edge of your seat, guaranteed! With an amazing ending, it leads us perfectly into MockingJay. The Hunger Games is a film that everyone can enjoy, even if you haven't read the book, you're still in for an original treat! The Hunger Games: Catching Fire deserves a 5 star rating in my opinion! And I hope the film continues to shred up the box office!!! Happy Hunger Games...and my the odds be NEVER in your favor!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
10 times better than the first one!,"This was probably the best movie I've seen all year, and I've seen a lot! The plot twists, story, and characters were absolutely spectacular! The ending gave me chills, how everything works together. The characters are so lovable, and Effie whom I couldn't stand, went from my hatred of her to one of my favorites in this movie! It also goes deeper within President Snow's evilness. He just one of those characters you want to brain. If you have seen the first one (which you have to before you see this one) then I HIGHLY suggest you see this one. Awesome plot, awesome characters, and awesome ending! The movie flows so well with the other one!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Sadly Does Not Meet Expectations,"The Hunger Games borrows a little from the myth of the Minotaur, a little from the short story The Lottery, a little from the Truman Show, a little from Schwartznegger's Running Man, a little from Lord of the Flies. The plot originated in the movie Battle Royale (you might say ripped-off) and the future-Gothic costuming is reminiscent of Dune. It's a wonderful Freudian mix if you can relate to it on an emotional level. Unfortunately you can't. The reason is because the kids play along. Instead of being vulgar and defiant for the camera, they enter the twisted battle on horse-drawn carriages, proud of their beautiful custom-made clothing, their designer taking a bow for the masses. Up against insurmountable odds -asked to do despicable things to both strangers and loved ones - you would expect them to be mooning the camera every chance they get - (which is 24/7) but that might make it a PG movie. So instead they deliver a few touching speeches and jump into the arena. Some of the effects are good, and there is some decent suspense, but these elements are spaced out among the slower moving backdrop.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
I liked it more than the first.,"It has been a year since Katniss(Jennifer Lawrence) and Petta(Josh Hutcherson) both won The Hunger Games, now they go on tour as celebrities pretending to be a couple, making speeches. But the president(Donald Sutherland) want to break Katniss, emotional as well has physical.I thought everything that was first done well in the first Hunger Games film, was done much better here. The setting was well done, also the tension was greatly approved upon. Jennifer Lawrence is great as Katniss, so was Josh Hutcherson as Petta, I they grew more since the first one, Woody Harrelson steals some scenes he's in, Donald Sutherland is also as the evil president, after seeing this, I'm excited for the next one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Does not disappoint!,"I went and saw the 8pm showing last night with my best friend and my boyfriend and it was absolutely amazing! I am usually the first one to pick out any difference between any book being made into film. Loved it! I laughed a lot and I cried a lot! I think I loved Catching Fire almost more than I loved The Hunger Games. The casting of the new comers was perfect! Jenna Stone is amazing as Johanna! I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone but I will say the casting, directing and acting are all on point! It truly is a great movie and an excellent addition to The Hunger Games franchise. The movie stayed true to the book which was the biggest thing for me! Definitely a must see even if you're someone who thinks this movie is just for girls! It's not! I've managed to get my boyfriend and my father into the series!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
A Powerful Adaptation Of The Second Book,"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a powerful adaptation of the second book in The Hunger Games Trilogy. Director Francis Lawrence has successfully taken the franchise and built from the first film's foundations. This was a smart choice as the characters, world and themes of the story are now more fleshed out and most importantly- easier to see (no shaky cam).Picking up almost a year after the first film, Catching Fire finds Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence, no relation to the director) still reeling from her time in the arena during the previous years' Hunger Games- a scare tactic to keep the people of ""Panem"" quiet and grateful to their oppressors as they watch 24 of their children go into a televised fight to the death. Katniss and Peeta (Hutcherson) are the first double winners of the games thanks to their ""true love"". Now both of them find themselves thrown back in to the arena as the evil President Snow (Donald Sutherland) declares that the reaping of the tributes will be selected from previous winners of the games.Jennifer Lawrence gives an intense, heartbreaking and invigorating performance as the reluctant heroine Katniss. She really seems to grasp the pain and terror Katniss goes through throughout the film. Katniss is not a girl of many words but when you have an actress who can convey genuine emotion without speaking- it doesn't matter.As Peeta, Josh Hutcherson (The Kids Are All Right, Epic) has grown from the baby faced baker's boy to a steadfast calm in an ongoing storm, keeping Katniss tethered to sanity. Liam Hemsworth still has minimal screen time as the lovesick and angry Gale, but he also represents the inner turmoil of an oppressed society that has had enough.Elizabeth Banks is stunning to watch as the overdressed and chipper Capitol escort Effie Trinket. Her outfits scream Capitol City Coutour, and she smiles with mad ignorance at the pain and oppression happening in Panem. Yet her face, when Katniss and Peeta are again called to be in the arena, shows a woman torn between her friends and her lifestyle. Jenna Malone gives a memorable turn as the troubled tribute Joanna. She is a controlled manic bringing electricity to every scene she steals. Joanna is a character only an actress as devoted and creative as Malone could pull off so magnificently.Sutherland's power obsessed President Snow is again given much more screen time than page time in the books. This is a smart move for the film. Snow represents the evil of The Capitol without the thrill and glamor of it. He is a man desperately holding on to a system that is bound to fall apart. Sutherland revels in the role and brings his own special brand of creepiness to it. In one scene Katniss and Snow converse across a desk that seems to be the only thing between them killing one another with their bare hands. The tension is high and that is the beauty of two highly skilled actors playing off one another.The film leans a little too heavily on the romance between Gale and Katniss. In the books Katniss indeed cares for Peeta and Gale, but she doesn't really have time or heart for romantic love. She is seen showing affection to Gale and this betrays her character. It does the book and it's message a disservice by hyping up a love triangle that certainly exists but is secondary to the story.Gone is the shaky cam from the first film, though it maintains its moody dark blue and grey color scheme. Shot in Hawaii, the Arena is almost exactly as pictured in the book and all the horrors they face keep you on the edge of your seat until the heart pounding finale. Catching Fire is in no means a feel good film. There is very little comic relief as the stakes get higher and higher and the people of Panem get angrier and angrier. All while the citizens of the glittering Capitol City watch the blood shed and horrific chaos from their comfy seats in their temperature controlled theaters, wearing their colorful clothes and eating their endless supply of junk food seems a little familiar doesn't it? - Christina Kishpaugh www.mediumraretv.org",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Probably the Worst of The BATTLE ROYALE Wanna-bes,"Wow, another really bad made Sci-Fi channel formulaic stink-fest. ""Catching Fire"" fails to bring any of the creative fun of the second BATTLE ROYALE movie. This second one is pretty juvenile, coming across as mainly a trite rehash of the first (and a bore). Jennifer Lawrence, who was captivating in the first Hunger Games, is too fine an actress to be treated to such a thoughtless and mundane script. I suppose we will watch the third installment just to see how it all turns out, but hopefully the creators will make a production that exceeds this by-the-numbers disappointment.This movie was given so many great reviews, I expected to be entertained. Instead, I struggled to stay awake. The writing was uninteresting. The acting wasn't great. And even good actors like Donald Sutherland or Woody Harrelson can't make a poorly written script any better. We finally stopped watching about 40 minutes in, when both of us turned to the other and realized we had lost interest a while ago. It was a shallow carbon copy of the first movie, with none of the suspense or intrigue of the Hunger Games. The screenplay was an unambitious bore fest. seems very likely the third movie will rise above this lackluster mess.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"The Spark Begins a Revolution in ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire""","It's nice that the sequel came out only a year later after the first one. The trailers just show bigger set pieces and SFX for the movie. And it's great that the trailers are honest. The follow-up increases the stake for everyone, including audiences.Katniss and Peeta embark on a Victory Tour across Panem. They realize that their actions in the 74th Hunger Games inspire an uprising from the districts. Announcing the 75th Hunger Games will either encourage or discourage the rebellion.Well, the 75th Hunger Games is kept secret by the book. But unfortunately, the trailers will tell you about it. I'll stay quiet about it. I'll let you know it by yourself. The movie is like 60% drama and 40%. Jennifer Lawrence is a great actress. She truly is deserving of an Oscar. I love how the arena becomes bigger and deadlier than the previous one. I love the twists of the arena itself.Another cliffhanger, another sequel!

I Loved It,"I went to see this movie last night and I must say that this could be in my list of the best movies of 2013 at the top.

the Battle Royale deception,"I enjoyed the first ripoff, but Catching Fire never did. The first 45 minutes or so of this movie should have been boiled down to about 15 minutes, seriously. I grew very weary waiting for something, anything, to happen. We need more BR reenactments and definitely more Liam Hemsworth (who is wasted here). The rest of the movie wasn't much better, and if the next 2 installments follow suit, there's just no point to continue watching these films. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire was essentially just a placeholder for the third movie in the series, whenever that comes out. There was not a whole lot of meat, just a lot of subtle plot-building that doesn't resolve at the movie's open ending.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Everdeenily miraculous.,"The odds most definitely were in their favour. 146 minutes of complete and utter gold – beautiful, crisp CGI throughout the entirety of the film – and it appears that in the film they are not only trying to form a revolution in the film, but Lionsgate and Francis Lawrence appear also to be revolutionising new cinematic techniques. Catching Fire is a must see for all people interested in Jennifer Lawrence's career, with her amazingly, emotion performance as the beautiful Katniss Everdeen she definitely puts ""her all"" into the film; or may you're just seeking to embrace into the land of the twelve districts. Overall the plot is fantastic and ends leaving the audience wanting more, after watching the fiery 2 and a bit hours I would advise everyone to watch this film as it is a must watch in 2013 cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Finally, a blockbuster movie worth the hype","Superbly acted, amazing visuals, constant thrills and much improved camera work. Catching Fire takes the foundations of it's predecessor's success and builds the ultimate blockbuster.The knockout punch of the year is here.After surviving the 74th Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen has unwillingly become a beacon of hope for the people and they see her as their spark, the spark that will start the fires of revolution to bring an end to the oppressive ways of the government of Panem, led by the merciless President Snow. And Snow is not happy. Whilst trying to figure out her own emotions and feelings towards her on screen sweetheart Peeta Mellark and her rugged and rebellious friend Gale Hawthorne, Katniss is placed in a precarious position; will she become a puppet for the Capitol to restore order? Or will she embrace the rebellion and change Panem forever? The stakes are high and one false move could spell doom for Katniss and those she loves.The superb Academy Award winning Jennifer Lawrence is on fine form once again and injects more emotion and passion into Katniss Everdeen. Fortunately, she is no longer having to carry the film through as many scenes as she did in the original due to the superb performances of the supporting cast.Firstly, Josh Hutcherson. Branded as just another pretty face by many, Hutcherson steps out of the shadows and ups his game, Peeta is no longer the wimpy lover boy that many saw him as but he is now a fierce and passionate warrior willing to sacrifice all he has for Katniss. A vast improvement from the first film, Hutcherson really has come on leaps and bounds.Woody Harrelson and Donald Sutherland improve greatly on their portrayals and become really convincing as Katniss' mentor and enemy respectively. This is probably down to more screen time, we rarely saw these two in the first film but this time round they play much more central roles to the film's plot. Elizabeth Banks is as superb as ever in her role as Effie Trinket, Katniss' chaperone. Phillip Seymour-Hoffman is an exciting addition of star power to the already big name cast, his role as new games makes Plutarch Heavansbee is well done but lacks some of the real intelligence that the character has from the book. Phillip's delivery at times is also a little blunt but he still does enough to create a great character. Liam Hemsworth's performance as Gale is perhaps the only blemish. His character gets more screen time this time around but he lacks any real conviction and comes across as quite bland.Rejoice! No more shaky cam! Francis Lawrence, director, breathes a well needed breath of fresh life into the film. The camera work is superb and very well edited with some super fast cuts which add much more thrill and tension to the film. The scenery is stunning and brilliantly constructed and we get a good look at several different locations within Panem.And the story? Well, if you've read the books, you'll know that you're in for a thrill. But if not, then this film will grab by the neck and never let you go. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll jump but most of all you'll never be able to forget it. This film will stick with you for a long time.The perfect blockbuster?

Fantastic sequel to the first!

From the effects, to the pace of the film, the acting and everything in between. The start of the film could have been a bit shorter but it was nice to get back into the mind frame that the first movie had left me in, and without the build up, the film wouldn't be anywhere near as good!Director Francis Lawrence really delivered following on from the first film directed by Garry Ross; the acting was absolutely superb from start to finish and once again a brilliant, effortless and capturing performance from Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Woody Harrelson and the rest of the cast.

They put everything that was needed in this movie, and only left out the things that weren't important in the first place. The second half of the movie was pretty much almost entirely book accurate and a lot of the lines were straight from the book.

Not as enjoyable as the book. Quite disappointed.,"In my opinion, this film is not as good as the first one. The actors are marvelous. Jennifer Lawrence's performance is excellent.

It has so much potential to explore from different perspectives. And it fails to do that. I will have to put the blame on the director. The arena scenes are very disappointing. Less excitement than the first movie. Overall, I am quite disappointed. The dialogue between Prim and Katniss in the trailer, which I liked very much, is partially edited out in the actual movie.

"Full of excitement, something i would watch over again","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire. literally just saw it an hour ago, and I must say, i'm fully satisfied. After reading the book, i expected much excitement and it literally projected it from letters to screen perfectly. Jennifer Lawrence, is breathe-taking, she totally understood Katniss Everdeen and portrayed her role perfectly. There was never any sense of boredom or a dead scene that would made me take my eyes off the screen. It was good. I can confidently say it is better than the first one. The Hunger Catching Fire has a more cloudy tone and setting and the excitement of every scene is non-stop compare to the first movie. However, the first movie has more suspense and a brighter tone. But i am not complaining, the movie was well done. Inappropriate language however caught my attention. It was not said once nor twice, and on occasions the actor's tried their best saying it and at the same time trying to hide it. Kiss scenes passed the amount i expected.

OK!  You Got Me!,"I was pretty indifferent to the first film. Because I wasn't on board with the younger people who have embraced the books, I felt kind of empty when I saw it. One small criticism is that the characters don't seem to have much say in what happens to them. Because they are viewed so closely, they can't even plot against the evil forces that have brought them to where they are. What I failed to take into account is that this is a three-book series and needs to be viewed as such. While I found the sequel really talky at times, the constant barriers being put forth by the forces in power, absolutely drain us as we hope for the best. The hardest thing for me to deal with is that only a single survivor can be had. This forces alliances and betrayal (much like most reality shows but with much more dire consequences). The saving grace for HG2 is that the characters are so much more interesting. They have become more human with human feelings, despair and love. I must have liked it because every time I saw that emcee with his white teeth flashing, I wanted him dead. The same with Donald Sutherland who reminded me of the James Bond character with the kitten. So, there go my emotions of revenge. Had a group of people not brought me to this film, I would probably have not bothered with it. Now, I will definitely see the next one to see how everything shakes out.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Jennifer Lawrence lights up the screen.,"The Hunger Games, based on the bestselling novel by Suzanne Collins, crushed box office records when it opened in March 2012. With a rabid fanbase, a massive marketing campaign, and an Oscar winner in the leading role, expectations are soaring for the next installment, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, which hits theaters today amid a whirlwind of publicity.When we last left Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), she had overcome insurmountable odds and made history by surviving The 74th Annual Hunger Games alongside her friend and ally Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson). After seeing the duo willing to sacrifice themselves rather than leave the arena without each other, the citizens of Panem have been captivated by their love story – unfortunately, it isn't real, and since the Games have ended, the two are barely even on speaking terms.As Katniss tries to reconcile her feelings for Gale (Liam Hemsworth) with the act she put on to keep Peeta alive, she also finds herself haunted by memories of the nightmarish things she experienced in the arena. Her situation is complicated even further by a visit from President Snow (Donald Sutherland), who is well aware of the truth and determined to remind Katniss that defying the will of the Capital cannot go unpunished.To say anything else about the plot would put us into spoiler territory, so I'll say this: Catching Fire improves upon The Hunger Games in nearly every conceivable way. The action scenes are bigger and more frequent, the pacing is tighter, and with relatable themes of social inequality and civil unrest woven throughout the narrative, there's an emotional weight to nearly everything that transpires on screen.With an Academy Award for Best Actress now under her belt, it's no surprise that Lawrence brings her A-game to this film, and her portrayal of Katniss will only allow for her star to shine even brighter. The rest of the returning cast members are also on point here, with Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks and Stanley Tucci stealing plenty of scenes out from under their younger costars.Fans of the source material would likely crucify me if I didn't mention the newcomers as well. Sam Claflin and Jena Malone are exceptionally well-cast as Finnick Odair and Joanna Mason, respectively, and Jeffrey Wright plays a small but crucial role. Philip Seymour Hoffman is also wonderfully sinister as new Gamesmaker Plutarch Heavensbee, and his first encounter with Katniss will send a shiver down every viewer's spine.As the second of four planned films, Catching Fire doesn't offer much in the way of conflict resolution. Everything that happens here is a buildup to the much bigger tale that will be told in the two-part finale, Mockingjay, and thus the closing minutes feel like a bit of a letdown. But this minor complaint aside, director Francis Lawrence has delivered a thrilling follow-up to an already excellent first installment, and fans can breathe easily knowing that he'll be returning to finish the job.-- Brent Hankins, www.nerdrep.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
