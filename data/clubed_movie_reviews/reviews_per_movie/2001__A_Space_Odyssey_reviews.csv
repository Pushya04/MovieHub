Planet of the Hominins...,"There's a monolith that seeks to influence, the evolution of the simian confluence, teaching apes how to compete, how to kill to get their meat, all leading to, a lunar revolution. On the moon, another block has been discovered, the apes now have the means to open wings and smother, it's to Jupiter they go, what they'll find nobody knows, but it doesn't seem to fill primates with dread. To protect they have a powerful A. I., it misses nothing, and nothing passes by, everything will not be fine, if you rely on an airline, as it watches with satanic, evil eye. At Jupiter, Darwin gets dispatched, down kaleidoscopic, psychedelic hatch, death brings birth and birth brings earth, a giant foetus wants to berth, I'm not sure hominins will make much of a match.A perpetually engrossing film that offers more conundrums than conclusions, your interpretations uniquely your own, but the scale, cinematography and concepts are truly out of this world.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Unmatched accomplishment,"Sometimes reading the user comments on IMDB fills me with despair for the species.  For anybody to dismiss 2001: A Space Odyssey as ""boring"" they must have no interest in science, technology, philosophy, history or the art of film-making.  Finally I understand why most Hollywood productions are so shallow and vacuous - they understand their audience.Thankfully, those that cannot appreciate Kubrick's accomplishment are still a minority.  Most viewers are able to see the intelligence and sheer virtuosity that went into the making of this epic.  This is the film that put the science in ""science fiction"", and its depiction of space travel and mankind's future remains unsurpassed to this day.  It was so far ahead of its time that humanity still hasn't caught up.2001 is primarily a technical film.  The reason it is slow, and filled with minutae is because the aim was to realistically envision the future of technology (and the past, in the awe inspiring opening scenes).  The film's greatest strength is in the details.  Remember that when this film was made, man still hadn't made it out to the moon... but there it is in 2001, and that's just the start of the journey.  To create such an incredibly detailed vision of the future that 35 years later it is still the best we have is beyond belief - I still can't work out how some of the shots were done.  The film's only notable mistake was the optimism with which it predicted mankind's technological (and social) development.  It is our shame that the year 2001 did not look like the film 2001, not Kubrick's.Besides the incredible special effects, camera work and set design, Kubrick also presents the viewer with a lot of food for thought about what it means to be human, and where the human race is going.  Yes, the ending is weird and hard to comprehend - but that's the nature of the future.  Kubrick and Clarke have started the task of envisioning it, now it's up to the audience to continue.  There's no neat resolution, no definitive full stop, because then the audience could stop thinking after the final reel.  I know that's what most audiences seem to want these days, but Kubrick isn't going to let us off so lightly.I'm glad to see that this film is in the IMDB top 100 films, and only wish that it were even higher.  Stanley Kubrick is one of the very finest film-makers the world has known, and 2001 his finest accomplishment. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It's a puzzlement...,"There are two schools of thought about 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.  One, is that it is the greatest science-fiction epic ever made. This is supported by those who claim to understand the complexities involved and leading up the Star Child ending. The others, like myself, find it as absorbing as watching paint dry on woodwork.The musical background is glorious, the colors are dazzling, and there's an interesting use of HAL as a villainous computer. Beyond that, there is nothing the least bit interesting about the human characters (trite dialogue and no personality or warmth to any of the individuals), the pace is unbelievably slow (so the intellectually gifted can philosophize on the mysteries of space), and the payoff at the end leaves you either breathless with enlightenment or convinced that you have watched three hours of nothingness.I had the same letdown feeling when I watched THE CLOCKWORK ORANGE, so your like or dislike of this movie is purely dependent on personal taste. Intellectuals will take the position that you are a mentally challenged clod if you dare disagree with their elevated opinion of the movie--so be aware that this is not conventional story-telling in any sense whatsoever and only for those who admire Stanley Kubrick's way with unlikely cinematic material.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Nietzsche and 2001,"I'm always surprised, given that the famous title track of 2001 is called ""Also sprach Zarathustra"", that nobody (nobody I've read, anyway) has noted the parallels between the movie and Nietzsche's famous work, ""Also sprach Zarathustra"". The idea of man's rebirth into a star child; an infant form of an indescribably more advanced being, is an explicit part of N.'s ""Zarathustra""; there is a prominent passage called ""On how a camel becomes a lion, and a lion becomes a child"", in which N. describes the first incarnation of the overman as a child, transcending both the ascetic, altruistic side of man (the camel; always asking to bear more weight) and the rapacious, brutish, will-to-power side of man (the lion). The fact that the song plays during the star child sequence can hardly be coincidence. And also, Zarathustra said that ""man is a rope tied between beasts and the overman."" The structure of the movie fits that description: a brief history of man as beast, until we become truly man by mastering weapons and acquiring reason, then a long sequence about man (the rope, as it were), and then a brief glimpse of the overman. The inscrutability of how these transformations occurred, and the suggestion that an external force caused them, is also Nietzschean; in ""Zarathustra"", he makes it pretty clear that he doesn't have a clue how people are going to be able to enact these changes themselves and suggests that we will have to depend on an outsider (Zarathustra) to show us how to ""go under"". Bowman's psychedelic sequence at the near-end could be seen as Kubrick's best 1960's-style attempt at depicting the mystical ""going under"".I know these parallels are pretty broad, and almost certainly have been noted elsewhere despite the fact that I have not personally seen it. But I just wanted to mention them, if for no other reason than to try to dispel the myth that Nietzsche was ultimately a gloomy philosopher. Few people find the ending of 2001 to be gloomy, and it is in my opinion, explicitly and unmistakeably Nietzschean. The case could certainly be made that 2001 is above all a dramatization of ""Zarathustra"" updated for the modern age. Feel free to disregard the outright snobbishness of my tying everything to Nietzsche.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Greatest Movie of All Time,"Instead of writing a paragraph, I'll give four good reasons why 2001 is  the greatest cinema experience of all time:  1) It is a visual Odyssey that could only be told on the big screen.  The special effects that won Kubrick his only Oscar are the most  stunning effects before that age of Jurassic Park and T2. They allow  Kubrick to give an accurate (or at least are the most accurate)  depiction of space travel to date. The silence that fills the space  scenes not only serves its purpose as accurate science, but also adds  to the mood of the film (to be discussed in a later point with HAL).  The fact that Kubrick shot the moon scenes before the Apollo landing is  a gutsy yet fulfilling move. Many have said that upon its original  release, it was a favorite ""trip"" movie. I can think of no other movie  that has such amazing visuals for its time and even of all time (sorry  Phantom Menace fans!)  2) Kubrick's directing style is terrific. As in all his films, Kubrick  likes to use his camera as means to delve into the psychology of his  characters and plots. His camera is not as mobile as other greats, such  as Scorsese, but instead sits and watches the narrative unfold. Faces  are the key element of a Kubrick film. Like classic movies, such as M  and Touch of Evil, Kubrick focuses on the characters' faces to give the  audience a psychological view-point. Even he uses extreme close-ups of  HAL's glowing red ""eye"" to show the coldness and determination of the  computerizd villain. I could go on, but in summation Kubrick is at the  hieght of his style.  3) HAL 9000 is one of the most villainous characters in film history. I  whole-heartedly agree with the late Gene Siskle's opinion of HAL 9000.  Most of this film takes place in space. Through the use of silence and  the darkness of space itself, a mood of isolation is created. Dave and  his crewmen are isolated between earth and jupiter, with nowhere to  escape. Combine this mood with the cold, calculated actions of HAL 9000  and you have the most fearful villain imaginable. I still, although  having see this film several times, feel my chest tighten in a  particular scene.  4) The controversial  ending of 2001 always turns people away from this film. Instead of  trying to give my opinion of the what it means and what my idea of  2001's meaning in general is, I'd like to discuss the fact that the  ending serves to leave the movie open-ended. Kubrick has stated that he  inteded to make 2001 open for discussion. He left its meaning in the  hands of the viewer. By respecting the audience's intelligence, Kubrick  allowed his movie to be the beginning, not the end, of a meaningful  discussion on man's past, present, and future. The beauty of 2001 is  that the ending need not mean anything deep, it can just be a purely  plot driven explanation and the entire movie can be viewed as an  entertaining journey through space. No other movie, save the great  Citizen Kane, leaves itself open to discussion like 2001. It is truly  meant to be a surreal journey that involves not only the eye but the  mind. Instead of waiting in long lines for the Phantom Menace, rent a  widescreen edition of 2001 and enjoy the greatest cinematic experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I don't get it,"Count me as one of the philistines who is too simple-minded to appreciate this so-called masterpiece. Actually, I have a degree in media studies and a great interest in science, science fiction and anything thought-provoking (the technical term is ""need for cognition""). But I am just baffled by this film and why it is so esteemed. It is simply slow, empty and lifeless. When absolutely nothing is happening on screen, am I supposed to feel or think something profound? Even when my professor explicitly explained to me why this film is so great, I still cannot convince myself that it is so.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A film of monolithic proportions.,"A review I have put off for far too long....Bluntly, 2001 is one of the best science-fiction films made to date, if not the very best. Stanley Kubrick was a genius of a film maker and this is one of his very best works. And although it is misunderstood by many, and respectively underrated, it is considered one of the best films of all time and I'll have to agree. Back in 1968, no one had done anything like this before, and no one has since. It was a marvel of a special effects breakthrough back then, and seeing how the effects hold up today, it is no wonder as to why. The film still looks marvelous after almost forty years! Take note CGI people. Through the use of large miniatures and realistic lighting, Kubrick created some of the best special effects ever put on celluloid. This aspect alone almost single-handedly created the chilling void of the space atmosphere which is also attributed to the music and realistic sound effects. I can't think of another film where you can't here anything in space, like it is in reality. Not only is the absence of sound effects in space realistic, it is used cleverly as a tool to establish mood, and it works flawlessly.Aside from the magnificent display of ingenious special effects, there are other factors that play a part in establishing the feel of the film. The music played, all classical, compliment what the eyes are seeing and make you feel the significance of man's journey through his evolution from ape to space traveler.The story, while seemingly simple, is profound. Sequentially, several mysterious black monoliths are discovered and basically trigger certain events integral to the film. What are they? Where did they come from? What do they do? These are all questions one asks oneself while watching the story develop and is asked to find his own way. While most come away with a general idea of what took place in the story, each individual will have to decide what it means to them. Any way one decides to answer these question results in profound solutions. It's not left entirely up to interpretation, but in some aspects it is. Experience it for more clarification. The end result is quite chilling, no matter your personal solution.While it is a long film, and sometimes slows down, it has to be in order to accurately portray the journey of man. It's not a subject that would have faired well in a shorter film, faster paced feature. Those with short attention spans need not apply.Last but not least, is the epitome of a remorseless antagonist, HAL 9000, the computer. Never has a machine held such a chilling screen presence. Which reminds me, for a film with such profound ambition and execution, there is surprisingly little dialogue. Another sign of Kubrick's genius.All in all, one of the best films made to date and one of the very best science fiction films made. A personal favorite. Everyone must see this film at least once.Very highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Visually Stunning, But Perhaps Overrated","Humanity finds a mysterious, obviously artificial, object buried beneath the Lunar surface and, with the intelligent computer H.A.L. 9000, sets off on a quest.Saying that ""2001"" is overrated is the sort of statement that can bring down hatred and vitriol from science fiction fans, Kubrick fans and more. Of course, it is possible to be a Kubrick fan and still generally dislike this film.Nobody can deny that this film is visually stunning, and a landmark in imagery. It also has the advantage of being the last film about space travel to be released before the moon landing, making it somewhat prescient in a way.But yet, does it need to be so long, so grand, with the music and long shots? Perhaps not quite ""pretentious"", but the film presents itself as being more important than it really is. Critics at the time (1968) denounced the film, and perhaps they were right. At the very least, two cuts could be made: a longer one for die-hard fans, and a shorter one for casual viewers.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Visually stunning, agonizingly boring and overrated","I decided to give this movie a shot since it's supposed to be an amazing piece of filmmaking and a classic. If you've read any other negative reviews then you've heard other people complain about how boring, slow paced and pretentious it is. The plot is a big question mark and there are scenes that draw on for an eternity. Add in numerous scenes with ear piercing noice and sound effects, it's just a really unenjoyable movie. Isn't the point of watching a movie to be entertained and enjoy ourselves?? I forced myself to sit through this and it felt like work, like I should be getting paid.I can't completely trash it though. It's incredibly beautiful visually. I can't believe a movie this old has such good effects and looks this good. The sets are also very impressive.All in all though, I can't ever recommend this to anyone. I wish I hadn't wasted 2+ hours on it. The first 15 minutes is either black screen, silence, or apes screeching at each other for god sakes. This is a movie that ""deep"" people claim to like to make themselves seem more cultured. Deuce Bigalo is 100 times more enjoyable. But to each their own I guess.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Sci-Fi That Put The Science In Science Fiction,"Putting the science in science-fiction, 2001: A Space Odyssey is an unprecedented, undisputed & unparalleled achievement, and a landmark moment in cinema history, for it nearly killed its genre by setting the bar so high that it hasn't been equalled or challenged ever since.

Tribute to one of the top 5 filmmakers of our time...,"I write this review just after hearing of Stanley Kubrick's death. It's a great loss, and I write about 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, because I feel it is the consummate Kubrick film, the one he will be most remembered for. It is a picture like no other, not only revolutionizing science fiction, but changing the way films are conceptualized. It was probably America's first 'art' film and has inspired the likes of George Lucas and countless other writers and directors.Aside from its visual greatness, the reason the film spawns so much discussion and analysis is because so many people have so many different interpretations of it. Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke, his co-writer, had a vision, but we have never really found out what was going through their minds. Of course, the skinny on its 'message' is how technology of the future will take over humanity and decide the course of our lives unless we are careful. 2001's ending is one of hope, a version of our rebirth through the star-child's flight back to earth. It is meaningless to many, but discerning filmgoers will understand.Although 2001 does not have the wicked, dark humor of DR. STRANGELOVE or CLOCKWORK ORANGE, or contain strong, eccentric characters that filled his earlier works like PATHS OF GLORY or SPARTACUS, I still feel he would've liked to be remembered most for this. If anything, HAL will be his most memorable character, dangerous, murderous, and artificial. It was a half-decade in the making at a time when Hollywood was still churning out dull musicals and just waking up to the New Wave of French and Italian cinema. Kubrick was a maverick director who made great films on his own terms, his own time, and for everyone else to marvel at. He will be missed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Order of the Universe,"I spent many a sleepless night after watching 2001. Not only because of the psychological horror (of which 2001 is a masterpiece) but also because of the way it brought me (a restless soul) some clarity to the way I observe the universe. It changed my way of thinking in a very profound way. And after reading the novel (by Arthur C. Clarke) I found myself once again inspired (a writer as I am) by the level of imagination.The Space Odyssey is not something one can just ""go and see"". One has to be ready for it, or it cannot be understood. In fact I don't think it can be understood at all, at least not all of it at once. It is a philosophical journey to the infinite and beyond, a masterpiece of it's genre and still after 32 years technically quite impressive all the way to the powerful musical soundtrack featuring 'Also spracht Zarathustra' by Richard Strauss and 'Blue Danube' by Johann Strauss.Take all the time you want, but eventually you are going to have to see this film. If it can bring some order and understanding to the universe of a struggling artist like me, it can certainly do it for you as well.Or maybe I'm just plain crazy...",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Cosmic Art,"Mankind's Self awakening is the theme of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", a process that unfolds along a space-time continuum. We ""see"" our primordial past, and we ""infer"" a cosmic future. The powers of intuition thus become the doors of perception, in our ongoing collective journey.From this transcendental perspective, a conventional, egocentric plot seems superfluous. Our frenzied conflicts and self-important dialogue are consumed in evolutionary change, and are irrelevant in a cosmos that is vast beyond comprehension. It's a tough lesson for a vain and aggressive species. Not surprising then that some of us huff and puff about the film's slowness and minimal story. For perceptive viewers, the remuneration is an inspirational sense of wonder and awe.In this film, which is mostly visual, geometric symbols guide our intuition. Circles and arcs represent nature. Right angles represent conscious intelligence. Some people think the sleek, black monolith is a Von Neumann probe. Maybe. Without doubt, the monolith is a visual metaphor for an extraterrestrial intelligence whose physical form is never shown. Mystery is more profound than explanation.""2001 ... "" is unique among films in content and scope. The cinematography is out-of-this-world, the special and visual effects are breathtaking, and the classical music is sublime. I rarely use the word ""masterpiece"" to describe a movie.

Leaves the Viewer Thinking for Weeks on End,"2001: A Space Odyssey is my favourite film of all time for simply one reason: the ending. Kubrick's ambiguous finish to this suspenseful trip will leave you debating and theorising its purpose for a long time.Further positive aspects include its eerie score and music throughout (notably at the beginning), the visually pleasing aesthetic, and contrastingly the use of silence to truly prove that ""no one can hear you scream in space.""I strongly recommend watching this film in a dark room with no distractions in order to achieve the full cinematic experience, and hopefully it will not disappoint.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
film is a poetical contemplation of most exciting eternal questions,"This movie is certainly one of the greatest films ever made. It is a story told in a steady pace, told mostly not by words but by cinematic means of expression. Perfect blend of spectacular special effects and classical music bring to life creations of human imagination in both realistic and poetical way. The story itself is quite simple at a first glance. As the title implies, there is an archetypal journey, a motive repeated for thousands of years. This motive was always used not only to depict a trip in space and time, and beyond, but also had rich philosophic meaning. The film is a poetical contemplation of most exciting eternal questions. It is not just an odyssey of a person; it is an odyssey of our species. The film is great by itself, yet, in my case, the impression from it will always be mingled with that from the book. I've read it at the age of 10, really not thinking about problems like 'what is the relationship between evolution of humankind and development of human morality'. But the impression was great enough to make me fall for entire genre of science fiction.The day I learned '2001' got only special effects Oscar and was not even nominated for the Best Picture was the day when 'Academy Award' completely became two words meaning nothing to me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A film about everything,"Like a Circle around the human condition, 2001 starts at the beginning, skips the middle, and proceeds to the ending, right back where we started. Noting the weakness of words compared to image(s), Kubrick wisely dispenses with dialogue, preferring the power and essence of the scenery, and allowing the intelligence of the audience to do the deciphering.  Or not, depending on the audience.A monolith in cinematic history, 2001 is a high water mark of direction, execution, and achievement.  If one considers the ambition of the film (a film about everything), and the measure of success the film achieved to that end, a very sound argument for this being the greatest of all films can be made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I try to like it each time I've seen it,"I just saw this again today on TCM, and it still leaves me empty. This movie is very well artistically made, but it's also very slow and boring. The most important part of the movie is HAL, but that's about it. There are other visually stylish movies which don't have great acting, such as Blade Runner, but at least that movie has sort of an interesting story. I must admit that I do like it because it is slow and visually artistic. This is only because it's very cold outside, and watching it in bed allows me to doze off here and there. If one were paying money to sit in a movie theater and expected to stay alert, I think many would have a hard time with it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
My brief review of the film,"A whimsical, often spectacular view of a future in which advances in technology dominate the world. It is well shot and although slow-moving it is intense and enjoyable throughout. The featuring of classical music to establish atmosphere works brilliantly; it provides a feeling of awe, mystery and intrigue  the same aura that Walt Disney worked in creating 'Fantasia'. The special effects, both sound and visual, are still spellbinding by the standards of today's technology. Aside from the technical pluses of the film, it stands strong as it is one of not many films out there that has something important to say about humankind, and where the human race is heading in terms of our increasing reliance on machines and our unquenchable thirst to discover. Despite an ending that is hard to understand, it is even harder to overlook this film a true cinema classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Worst Kubrick film,"I'm sorry for the lopsided rating but this movie needs to be dropped down a peg from it's absurd status on the IMDb 250. How this ever got lumped in the other great Kubrick movies I will never know. In Dr. Strangelove you had an awesome dialog about war and with A Clockwork you had a look at violence and rehabilitation as well as many other things.In 2001 you have a look at monkeys for 12 or so minutes. Everyone gets it. It's not hard to get, it's pretty, it has some smart writing but the lack of editing is like watching someones life from beginning to end. 2001: An Eternity would be more fitting. I know some people will say you know what it's perfect, every minute had to be there. That's fine I wouldn't want to rob you of your monkey action or your ship docking sequences but I swear you could do this movie in a short and not lose the message.Maybe that was the point, To do a movie with space imagery and a ton of sunrise images that you can play you're enigma CD with the lights dimmed low as you try and woe some woman with your impressive movie watching resume. Whatever the case this movie shouldn't be uttered in the same breath as his other movies, they actually have content.Knowing his work and picking this one over the rest would be like picking Bad Boys 2 over The Third Man, Eye candy over substance.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
2001: A Mesmerising Odyssey,"To me, this is not only Kubrick's best film but also a milestone of the genre. It is quite long at around two and a quarter hours, and it is slow, that I agree with. But it is never boring, well not to me it isn't. Besides, and this is up to interpretation, but I think the slow pacing is deliberate, it adds to the haunting and eerie quality 2001 has and also to assimilate every shot which speak volumes, and also 2001's greatest strength is actually in the details.The story is somewhat abstract in its structure but is also quite complex, innovative and interesting yet has a simple message, and the screenplay and direction by Kubrick are superb. The acting is not the film's best asset, but it is good enough, with Douglas Rain the standout as the voice of HAL 9000 as he is really quite brilliant. Two things especially make 2001 so good. One are the visuals- even after all those years they are simply outstanding. The cinematography is indeed splendid, as are the colours and settings, but there are so many memorable images. The images of the giant Starchild floating through space and the tribe of apes painfully putting two and two together still resonate considerably even now. The other is the music. Coming from a big classical music enthusiast, I was delighted by the use of Also Sprach Zarathustra and On the Beautiful Blue Danube and how they combined with the visuals were exceedingly clever.Overall, this is a truly wonderful film that is worth seeing for the visuals and music alone and still continues to intrigue and perplex with the ending. As much as I like Oliver and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, two of my childhood favourites, and the brilliant Lion in Winter to me this is it... the best film of 1968. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The First Time I Made It to 2001...,"In late 1968, I got my dad to drive me to Hollywood (I was ten) to see ""2001"" during its roadshow engagement. Earlier that year, during a family trip to San Francisco, we had stopped to eat at a Howard Johnson's diner, and with our meal I had received a comic book promoting the film (if you'll remember, one of Kubrick's less astute predictions was that Howard Johnson's would be the food franchise on the Space Station). After the mind-blowing revelation of that comic book, I suffered through four or five months waiting for my chance to see it.It took two tries. The first try was the weekend that the Apollo 7 mission became the first to circle the moon. My dad took not only me but also my mom and six-year-old brother. We drove the thirty miles to Hollywood......only to find that ""2001"" was sold out.Quickly we checked the paper for a suitable alternative. There was an ad for another interesting looking sci-fi film playing just a few blocks up Hollywood Boulevard... ""Barbarella."" This was literally just a week or two before the ratings system went into affect, so the only way we had to judge the suitability of the subject matter was by the ad, which was illustrated with goofy, fun-looking cartoons. ""I wanna see Bar-bella!"" my brother cried excitedly. It looked good to me too. So off we went.Try to imagine sitting next to your fairly prudish mother in 1968, watching -- without any warning -- Jane Fonda's zero-gravity striptease. And then every stripe of fetishism and polymorphous perversity, under only the thinnest satirical sci-fi camouflage. I remember afterward, out in the lobby, my dad kneeling by my sniffling brother, gently explaining ""Those dolls couldn't really have been biting her,- they COULDN'T really bite her because their teeth were angled inward, if they were really going to bite her their teeth would have had to angle OUT, so you see...""But I digress.On our second try, dad took just me. This time we got in. The theater was huge, with dark red curtains. The screen was huge, but thankfully not deeply curved like a Cinerama screen. (Over the decades since then, I have seen ""2001"" several times at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood, where the screen IS deeply curved. Every time the spaceship Discovery is shown from the side, it curves up at the ends like a smile. By the nature of its visual geometry ""2001"" was meant to be seen on a FLAT screen.)The overture began, weird otherworldly sounds like I'd never heard before, as the auditorium lights slowly dimmed. And then, that amazing stylized MGM logo, created specifically for ""2001"" and never used at the head of any other film (although MGM did later adopt it for a time as their corporate logo). And then the thrilling swell of ""Also Sprach Zarathustra,"" and that awesome lineup of the moon, the Earth and the Sun! An image like nothing ever seen before on a movie screen. Or in real life either: ""2001"" was showing us vistas of our solar system that NASA photography had yet to capture even approximately.Half the time I had no idea what was going on. But I didn't care. To me it seemed like a film FROM the year 2001. I was enthralled, and goaded to TRY to understand. More than any other film I can think of, ""2001"" really lived up to that oft-misused cliché phrase: it ""made me think.""Driving home that night, I remember doing the math: in 2001 I'll be forty-three.

Mesmerizing experience,"(r#54)Only Stanley Kubrick could create a film like 2001. It is unlike anything made before or after it and whether you like it or not, it is an unforgettable experience. I urge anyone who disliked this film to give it at least one more chance - I can honestly say that the film was way too far off the wall for me to appreciate it the first time I watched it.2001 is overflowing with iconic images, from the opening scene accompanied by Richard Strauss' ""Thus Spoke Zarathustra"", to the bone being tossed into the air by the ape. It has become such a huge phenomenon that even today TV series, movies, parodies and comics continue to spoof it. It is impossible to hear The Blue Danube without associating it to Kubrick's masterpiece. And that is what it is, in every sense of the word: a masterpiece. Nothing is half-baked or average about 2001 - it is a work of enormous attention to detail and love for the art of movie-making itself. Although Kubrick continued to direct amazing movies like The Shining, A Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket (which were all far more accessible movies) after 2001, he couldn't top this: his crowning achievement.It's easy to see how viewers may be put off by 2001 - it doesn't follow the usual movie formula where the plot comes to a conclusion at the end. In fact, neither before nor after 2001 has a movie been made the same way. Plot line and characters are more or less redundant in this film: It's all in the images and music, and what it all means. I won't go into the point of 2001 since I haven't read the book and I think it is up to each viewer to decide for himself what it all means.The movie jumps from the very dawn of man's use of weapons to a time when space is heavily trafficked, and continues to show us the fate of some unlucky astronauts at the hands of a super-intelligent computer called HAL-9000. I won't spoil what happens in the end but I will say that if you could see it coming, you must be some kind of super genius; as far as I'm concerned it is the single least predictable ending for a movie, ever.Kubrick is the only director that I know of who has portrayed space in the most realistic way possible: vast, endless, dark, empty, and soundless. It's admirable that a director goes out of his way to make sure no sounds are heard in space, but rather than let this make the movie dreary and dull, Kubrick uses this to his advantage: the chilling silence of some scenes actually help build up the atmosphere in a way that no movie has done before. Some scenes are outright scary, working at an almost subconscious level. Kubrick has always been a master of creating moods and emotions with the viewer, and 2001 is the prime example of this: The climactic scene in the bathroom is unbelievably frightening, and Kubrick creates a sense of dread purely without monsters, murderers or loud music. It's amazing.The movie is highly meditative and definitely not the one to watch if you want a loud, action-packed Star Wars-type adventure. The long periods of near-complete silence, the low-key dialogue, HAL's monotonous voice (a stroke of genius) and the scattered pieces of classical music set you in a state of complete relaxation and makes you think. I realize this is highly personal and will not work for all viewers.The special effects are pitch-perfect, still as good today as they were almost 40 years ago. While the digital effects of the Star Wars prequels will be outdated in 10 years, 2001 will continue to stun people with its shockingly realistic and believable effects. Although I would have preferred Kubrick to win the Best Director Oscar for this (as well as many of his other films), the Best Effects award is completely deserved. 2001 still beats many of today's movies in terms of best effects.If you've grown tired of mediocre movies, give 2001 another chance. At first viewing, I thought it was tiresome and drawn out. At second viewing, it was the most perfect movie ever made. If you're open minded, this is for you, if Pirates of the Caribbean is your favourite movie of all time, it's not - and I don't say this to insult fans of Pirates, I'm just saying that this film might not be up your alley.I hope I don't sound too pretentious because I know how horrible many of 2001's rabid fans can be. I know for sure that it is not certain you'll enjoy 2001 - but I urge you to give it a chance. It is the ultimate acquired taste, and in my opinion, a masterpiece of epic proportions.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Beautiful boredom,"To be frankly honest most people will be disappointed with 2001: A Space Odyssey. Including myself. It's boring, but that doesn't change the fact it's one of the most beautiful films ever made.To like and enjoy the story you must be a huge interest in science, technology, philosophy, history or the art of film-making. Because it's not an enjoyable storyline. It's incredibly boring, and you don't even find out about the storyline until after it has happened. Also, the first 20 minutes were the most unnecessary I've ever seen in a movie.But it's beautiful. Probably one of the most beautiful films ever made. With incredible shots of space and amazing use of lightning that is so shocking considering it was released in 1968.I don't recommend 2001: A Space Odyssey if you are not a big science, technology etc. But if you just want something beautiful you should watch it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I couldn't even pass the first 10 20 minutes. Monkey part is interesting and all but man everything in this movie takes it time. Every angle every scene is slow as possible, some new ideas for its time maybe exploring them with slow shots and no dialogues cool and all but today they are not so new. Spaceships and A. I and aliens engineering humanity and speeding up the pace of its cognitive evolution yeah nice ideas and all but uh sorry they are not enough for me to focus constantly on the screen.

Beauty is underestimated.,"This movie is not just good, its amazing. Besides providing us with good performances, original plot, fantastic special effects, thoughtful messages and a lot more, it was an, until then, completely unseen world to the public. This is the first sci-fi movie that takes us out into the unknown space of our galaxy with such splendid effects and mind bursting reality that the audience is left without words. I am only 16 years old, and therefore I was raised into a world of modern effects and 3D animations in the movies. But nonetheless I was really, and I mean completely, blown away by the quality of these effects, even after almost 40 years. The visual effects was just one of the merits of this movie, the camera was in true Kubrick style amazing and enchanting. It feels like you are consumed by the screen and sucked into this surreal world (especially in the round control room or whatever you call it). The effects, the camera and the sheer size of this movie caught me of my guards even though I had seen the rating before I bought it. But this movie has more to it than this. The meaning of this movie can also be interpreted as you wish yourself, even though I think there are some clear points concerning humanity (also true Kubrick style). How humanity on top of its evolution is just maintenance on board, and therefore not needed by the computer, one of humanities tools. How we in space appear like babies, learning to walk once more, losing control of our tools in zero-gravity, breathing through equipment as fish out of water. On the peak of evolution, we set out into the never-ending adventure as simple primates. Many might think that the length and slow pace of this movie is, boring? ridicules? or just a waste of time. But before you can jump to those conclusions, think about why Kubrick spends time with calm music and a spaceship in the middle of space for several minutes. This is to illustrate the beauty of it. Beauty, beauty is in many cases not granted the rightful respect by viewers. Kubrick wants to show us beauty, and if we do not succumb to it and relax, we can not enjoy this film as it was intended. This is not an ordinary movie, we can not just sit and watch as we can with some other movies, this requires time, thoughts and above all commitment and feelings to watch. All of this together, makes this one of the greatest achievements in the world of moving pictures. 10/10 Let me know if you agree with me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"If only one film makes it off this planet, it should be 2001.","If the Earth was about to blow up and I could choose only 1 film to survive us, it would definitely be this. What's funny is ""2001"" isn't even my favourite movie. But I believe it tells the story of humankind better than anything else I've ever seen on the big screen. Essentially it asks the age old question ""what is the meaning of life?"", and for my money, it provides a very satisfying answer.What makes it such a phenomenal work of art is that it is able to address some of the most divisive, incompatible human attitudes (in particular, religion) and present us with a model that we ALL can accept. Judeo-Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Scientologists, Fundamentalists, Existentialists, Atheists and even Satanists can find truth in this film because it applies no labels. Like the mysterious yet commanding ""black box"" that appears in the film, it remains exactly that: a sealed black box which can be anything we choose to see.The black box may represent God. Or it may represent science. Or it may represent history. Or it may represent individuality. Make up your own mind, and you will learn a little something of yourself. Really, this movie is like a puzzle with infinite solutions, designed to teach us about ourselves by what we see in it. It's truly interactive. No other film has ever made me feel this way.The plot is almost irrelevant, so I won't bother summarizing. What you should pay attention to are the themes and questions the movie addresses.1) Are we alone in the universe? 2) Is there a point to life? 3) Are we heading in the right direction?By the time the movie ends, you should have an answer to all three, and yet all our answers will be different.SO WHAT THE HECK IS THE MOVIE ABOUT? OK, since you've read this far, I'll give you an idea. The movie is about evolution. Not just your Darwinian natural selection stuff, but a compelling proposal that evolution was (or continues to be?) guided by some extraordinary force. If you like, this is the marriage of God & science that we've all been waiting for. Or if you like, it's a testament to pure science. Or pure God. Like I said, Kubrick allows for every possibility. And I have to hand it to him for remaining so tight-lipped that nobody ever knew what his personal feelings were on the matter.The film starts in prehistoric times with a tribe of moribund ape-like creatures on the edge of either extinction or excellence. Then we jump ahead a million years or so to find humans in a similar state of stagnation yet on the edge of another fantastic evolutionary step forward. Finally we jump forward to catch a glimpse of what evolution may have in store for us in the not-too-distant future. If it sounds like a documentary, I suppose it almost is, except without Marlon Perkins talking over it. We are expected to fill in the details ourselves, and that is the beauty of what this film does. It takes a purely objective approach and manages to lead us to our own satisfying conclusions.A word of caution. I don't think you're supposed to ""get"" this film on one viewing. I certainly didn't, and I've never met anyone who did. Even Roger Ebert (who ranks this as the greatest film of all time) was initially lukewarm about it when it premiered in '68. So if you feel like you just got cheated, or if you have no idea what everyone's raving about, please be patient and give it some time to sink in. I saw this movie when I was 16 and loved the middle part but hated the ending. Decades later I saw it again and suddenly understood it better. But I confess there's still a lot I haven't realized. I suppose as I get older and hopefully wiser I'll continue to interpret new ideas. And that's why this is the greatest movie of all time. It is about evolution, and moreso it EVOLVES WITH US.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Always beyond time, even in this year 2018","I am really very upset with myself that I've not seen this movie until 2018.

The most overrated movie I've ever seen,"After hearing so much praise over it from the entire planet, I firmly believe it IS the most overrated movie of all time. Everyone spreads around that it is ""the best science fiction film ever made"" and it's the best of Kubrick. Everyone. I feel like I'm missing something here. How is this better than A Clockwork Orange and Dr. Strangelove? As of now I've seen 7 Kubrick movies, the other 6 were better.I watched it once with huge expectations, and I was extremely disappointed with it. Since people were still saying the movie was amazing, I decided to give it a second chance. So I watched it again with low expectations, and I still didn't think it was anything more than decent. In fact, my rating went down. I gave it TWO chances and still wasn't impressed.My problem with the movie is that it is one of the slowest movies I've ever seen. It basically goes like this: long shot with classical music in background, long shot with classical music in background, long shot with classical music in background, a bit of dialogue, long shot with classical music in background, long shot with classical music in background, some more dialogue, long shot with classical music in background, long shot with classical music in background...For the first hour of the movie I was content with this, the next five I was starting to lose patience. It's so slow like this that by the time we got passed the monkey montage I started to lose interest in everything. Too little dialogue, too little interesting characters, too many long shots. It just isn't my thing.But this doesn't mean the movie is horrible. I gave it a 6 for a reason (albeit barely a 6). The cinematography is amazing, the shots are nice, extremely impressive visual effects - highly earned Oscar for Kubrick, and a creepy atmosphere. Pretty much anything technical this film gets an A+ with. And HAL is an interesting villain.For me, this is one of those movies that everyone loves, and as much as you want to, you just can't. Maybe I should give it another chance... third time's a charm. But how many times do I need to watch something in order to like it?",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A movie that is not for idiots. I'll explain why.,"As I read all the negative reviews for 2001: A Space Odyssey (On Amazon. Com), I begin to wonder as to what kind of morons people can be today. In today's society, an acceptable film has to be fast paced and highly entertaining (Just look at the Oscar results of the past five years). They don't have to have a plot or a purpose. But it was the reviewer on Amazon who said he was happy that Stanley Kubrick was dead that really got me mad.The day that Kubrick died was a dark one for American cinema. Few directors alive today have the guts to try something new and imaginative. It's all sequels to hit movies (American Pie 2, Rush Hour 2, Jurassic Park 3) or remakes of old classics (Planet Of The Apes). 2001 was bold. It was a challenge. It was something new. It defied every set standard of Science Fiction films, from its unconventional narrative to its use of classical music. It showed that you do not need to have lots of dialogue to express ideas or emotions. Images can be just as powerful. And 2001 is unthinkable today without the power and excitement of Thus Spoke Zarathustra or the waltzes of Strauss The Blue Danube. 2001 critics also say that the humans are boring and `By the Book', while HAL the computer is sympathetic and interesting. That was Kubrick's purpose: The mechanizing of the human and the humanization of the machine (Another example would be the two airplanes in the opening of Dr. Strangelove).I have also read reviews of people who claim the movie is boring and complain that scenes take too long. Without the Dawn of Man ape scenes, would you really know what the hell was going on? It would start suddenly with a ship in space. It would still be, in your words, Lame! The docking scenes take five to ten minutes because that is how long it takes to dock a ship! It is not like in Armageddon or Star Wars where it takes just a second. These men are professional airline (Or spaceline?) pilots who are also carrying a cargo of passengers. They sure are not going to risk their lives just to arrive on time. Things are also slow moving in space because of gravitational forces and because it is a sterile and empty environment.Other morons also talk about how Boring the Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite scenes are and how pointless they are. The Star Gate Dave Bowman goes through is the Grand Central Station of the aliens (A highway you could say). The room he ends up in is a `Zoo' where extra-terrestrial `Zoo Keepers' study him and the way he acts in his natural habitat. The monolith there changes him from a young adult Bowman to a middle aged Bowman to an old, dying Bowman and finally into the Star Child. It is only boring if you think its boring.Some morons also don't know what the monoliths are about. In the beginning, the monolith is a teacher to the apes that causes them to evolve into humans. The monolith on the moon is a beacon. It sends a radio message to the extra-terrestrials on Jupiter telling them that the human race has advanced into outer space. The one floating in Jupiter space is the passageway to the Star Gate and I have explained the one in the room. We also never see the extra-terrestrials at all throughout the movie (We can however hear them in the room). Thus we have a greater fear of them because we do not know how they act or what they look like.My final thought is that if you have a short attention span or if you thought Citizen Kane was worse than Battlefield Earth, you should stick to Star Wars (Though I did like it) and a stupid Bruickheimer/Bay movie for your entertainment. 2001 is certainly one of the greatest movie experiences of all time and also shows that cinema can be one of the most powerful forms of art and can be utilized for other purposes besides showing people getting shot in the head or fornicating. It is also a reminder that Hollywood's future is always better than the real future. Oh how I would love to have my own Space Liner with it's own spacepods, a videophone and a zero gravity toilet.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The finest example of the art,"I can't remember when or where I first saw 2001: A Space Odyssey, probably because it is just so stunning. It epitomises grace, both visually and intellectually, and more than any other film it perfectly articulates the true purpose of science fiction.Every film (if not art in general) is ultimately an exploration of the human condition; but whereas so much Sci-Fi is simply a stylistic treatment of another genre (typically the Western) 2001 explores concepts that no other genre could - and that is what Science Fiction is for, stepping beyond what we have in order to better understand it. Exactly what 2001 explores is unclear, as the endless debates and its notorious ending make, well, perfectly clear; but if it is meant to do no more than stimulate thought then it achieves greatly.If Fantasy and Horror represent the imaginative then Science Fiction is the philosophic, but only the greatest examples rise to the challenge and that happens too rarely. Blade Runner (Sci-Noir, but anyway) is one of the few, questioning another facet of human nature, again doing so without resorting to blunt explanation when eloquent ambiguity communicates much more powerfully. So too Metropolis, the Citizen Kane of Sci-Fi; but compare these with The Matrix Trilogy (Kung-Fi), which had the potential to be both accessible and thought provoking but finally delivered only glossy nonsense.As well as breaking technological boundaries in its production, 2001 remains the strongest example of ""hard"" Sci-Fi for its scientific realism and the wholly convincing portrayal of future technology - human level, of course. Not just in the obvious hardware of the space age but also for HAL 9000, undoubtedly the most authentic representation of AI in either film or reality.I love this film. Over the years I read Arthur C. Clarke's Odyssey novels and found them more or less enjoyable, but the original film remains the pinnacle. When much younger I liked 2010 (A Space Idiocy...) which can only be regarded as a children's primer and was out-grown long ago, but there really can be no comparison between them, maybe with any other film at all. Stanley Kubrick was painterly in his style, but I think 2001 more than any other demonstrates the purest work of his imagination. A masterpiece unconstrained by the world that spawned it.As I write these words, 1040 other people have already had their say and I can only assume that no-one else will ever read this. Sadly I'm not patient enough to wait for another 960 to do the same, so the ultimate 2001: A Space Odyssey commentary will have to go to someone else. I hope they like it very much.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
2001: A Space Odyssey - Movie Review,"LIFF30 2016 #5""Daisy.""So I just saw ""2001"" at a film festival and it was kinda incredible. Why do I feel like I just ticked off my bucket list of things to die before you die. I've been waiting a long time to watch this on the big screen. I already seen the movie about 3 or 4 years ago, but my memory of the film isn't that strong. So when I was picking what movies I wanted to see at (LIFF), and this was on the list, as the festival also shows classic movies.Re-watching this movie was quite the experience. Nothing like a massive screen and loud speakers blasting off beautiful music while drifting in space. From the dawn of man till the end of human life. The cycle repeats.But seriously, what can I honestly say about ""2001"" that hasn't been said already. It's one of the greatest Sci-Fi films of all time. It's groundbreaking and pure genius. Even at the slower pace parts, I was still engaged. After it was over, I was contemplating on it.For a 1968 film, it's visual effects still hold up today and looks way more convincing than today. Well, there was a couple of effects that was noticeable, but the rest (which is mostly practical) still looks amazing. The ""Star Gate"" sequence is one example of a trippy and a breathtaking effect that it owned Kubrick an Oscar.Every shot in this movie is like something you would hang up on your wall. Kubrick has been known for being a perfectionist of his work. This is a work of an artist that doesn't just get praised for how much he dose, but how little. Three years of making this - you can get easily attached to your work that after awhile you find the hidden beauty of the story. Do it 40 or 127 times until you get what you want and exactly how you wanted. A similar method that Chaplin use for ""City Lights"". But it isn't just images that kept me attention and I don't think Stanley was intending on that. There's plenty of scenes that goes on forever, not for spectacle, but more of use to inhabit everything that's going on.It also helps that music in this is so beautiful, but very eerie at the right moments. I can take the monolith on the moon scene as a great example of the bone chilling music. It may be scary for some, because of ""Requiem for Soprano"" playing in the background, but I kinda see like this:Man discovers a 4 million year old structure buried under the surface of the moon. Perfect angles and a disturbingly flawless complexion. imagine if this event actually occurred in reality and you were sitting in front of your TV when a breaking news bulletin interrupts your program. Just imagine the weight of the emotions you feel. There is no explanation for how this structure could even exist. its impossible! It will be the most reality-shattering event in the history of the world.It's one of my favorite scenes of all time, because the scene alone perfectly captures that feeling. No explanation. No answers. No reason.Overall: Films like ""Space Odyssey"" is why I love movies. Extraordinary and beautiful work of art. ""2001"" isn't just a classic for it's effects or the show stealer Hal9000, but how it wants to inspire and enlarge us. A space voyage that evokes questions and kept the audience in awe for 48 years.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Biggest Fast Forward,"What the meaning of the black monolith is in 2001: A Space Odyssey has been puzzling moviegoers for generations. I confess I haven't any better idea than any of the others who have written on this board. I guess Stanley Kubrick and Arthur Clarke wanted everyone to make their own evaluation. A little more evidence could have helped.The awesome visual affects of 2001 for which the film won its only Oscar in 1968 have blinded a lot of viewers to the ultimate incomprehensibility of the plot. That big black rock means something a whole lot different to the prehistoric caveman than to the futuristic astronauts. To one it means power, the other understanding. It's like some all powerful creator has left this touchstone for mankind to take another leap forward.The film begins with the cave people who are struggling to survive against animal creatures who are better equipped than they are for dominance. But contact with the rock, so glaringly out of place from the surroundings awakens the latent intelligence in the cave folk and they stage a comeback against their foes. It's the beginning of man's dominance.In the biggest fast forward in screen history, we are now in the future and another of these things has been discovered on a moon of Jupiter, the first sign of intelligent life away from earth. Scientists Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood and three other scientists in cryogenic suspension are sent to investigate. Remember we haven't discovered warp drive yet.Civilization may have taken too far a leap forward because these guys are in the hands of an all powerful computer named HAL who controls the ship and their very lives by definition. What's supposed to be a tool for man now is his dominator.When man does come in contact with that monolith on a Jupiter moon, my own interpretation is that the contact represents an all powerful creator telling man to reflect on what he has achieved and to warn him to not go too fast forward in the future. The monoliths represent signposts, like checkpoints in a race to God only knows what end.I'm always leery of rating a film like 2001 too high when the plot is so vague and speculative. But the special effects and Kubrick's use of classical music to create that space ballet just so dwarf the human beings involved, in effect the film itself is a warning. And all that music was in the public domain so MGM didn't have to lay out big bucks for a composer.I always favor story over spectacle which is why I can never give 2001: A Space Odyssey the highest rating. But when the spectacle is as awesome as what Stanley Kubrick gives us, you just sit there amazed.Of course 2001 came and went and instead of reaching for the rest of the solar system and beyond, mankind regressed into barbarism with the most notable event being a planned massed murder. Mankind needs to touch the monolith and make another leap forward. Maybe Kubrick should have looked farther ahead and called his film, 2101: A Space Odyssey.I hope we touch the monolith before that.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Horrifically boring and usually pointless,"This movie had about 45 minutes of greatness strewn throughout a 2 1/2 hour movie. In these 45 minutes the pacing, the visuals, the dialogue (when applicable) was magnificent. The rest was a hodge-podge of (usually beautiful) scenes thrown in there to make it look like a cool sci-fi movie.In one scene of the movie they retrieve a piece of equipment off the top of the spaceship because the computer says it will fail soon. In doing so, we hear 10-15 minutes of the same hissing sound from the man's oxygen tank and his breathing while the pod flies slowly, gracefully over so he can get the damn thing. How does this further the story? How does this say anything? I can get the feeling of isolation in space without having to hear 15 minutes of breathing and a hissing oxygen tube. Actually, I got it plenty well before that thank you very much.Another example is a 45 minute long sequence (if I'm exaggerating it isn't by much) where it shows a bunch of pretty colors flashing by interrupted by a picture of his eye, occasionally. These would have been magnificent scenes if they had done something for the story or highlighted some type of theme that actually applies. I guess it's supposed to represent the infinite, but I don't see the infinite as being a bunch of random effects shots all streaming together in the most lethargic fashion possible. Maybe that's just my opinion.It's almost as if they are going for this artsy style which includes only a few brilliant moments of actual human emotion strung together by a bunch of effects sequences that show the same things, with the same noises, for such a long time that I felt like shooting myself in several instances (notably the ones I mentioned).In summary, I'd give those 45 minutes I mentioned before a 9.5/10 because I could imagine them being magnificent with decent support from the rest of the movie, while the rest of the movie gets a 1/10. Which averages out to about 4/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Some remarks from someone who was there...,"I find the divergent comments about this film quite interesting. It's either a masterpiece and suprmely involving or it's a worthless boring fake. I think if you were in a Cinerama theatre and had the experience that Kubrick intended, there would be no doubt that you had just seen one of the great films of all time. The pacing of this film is absolutely dependent upon the overwhelming size of the image and the detail of the soundtrack. There is no way to describe in words the power of the first time I heard the Zarathustra theme in a Cinerama theatre. It went way beyond what you would experience even in a concert hall since the music surrounded you and the volume and fidelity were simply overwhelming. This is a film that had people shaking and giddy following the title card! And so it goes for the rest of the film. What may seem slow and uneventful on a video screen was just what was required for an audience to absorb all the visual and aural information. Those stills for example, at the start of the film were accompanied by desert sounds that were so real you expected a cricket to hop out from under your seat. And the long sequences outside the Jupiter ship involving the AE35 unit are entirely engrossing and set one up for the silent horror that ensues.I just watched the film again for the I don't know how manyth time, and every time I see it I am surprised by threads I never noticed. This time I was amazed that the film is so much about murder. Murder as the basis for evolution, murder of humans by machines, murder of machines by humans. And has there ever been a greater metaphor for our technology dominated society that the sequence of the man jogging in his giant squirrel cage while the saddest music you have ever heard plays on the soundtrack?",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Movie Review: 2001: A Space Odyssey,"2001: A Space Odyssey is a story about man vs machine, which starts with Dr Dave Bowman and other astronauts being sent into space for a mysterious mission. However, their AI system HAL starts acting up which leads to an intense between man and machine that happens through time and space. This movie is very interesting and Stanley Kubrick did a very good job adapting this movie from a short story, he was able to make this movie almost three hours long and most of it feels pretty surreal. The idea of going through time and space is something that is always discussed about, but this movie portrays it in a realistic manner, almost as if it something that could actually happen. I personally thought that this movie was okay and I am not really one that enjoys these kinds of Sci-Fi movies and I only really wanted to watch it because the premise for it sounded interesting. I would recommend this to anyone who likes Sci-Fi movies or to anyone who wants to see a good Stanley Kubrick movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"In space, no-one can hear you yawn.","I was born in 1968, the year that saw the original release of 2001: A Space Odyssey; of course, I didn't really get into sci-fi cinema until almost a decade later, when that other movie—you know, the one with the droids, blasters and aliens—broke box-office records. Now aged 47, and fully prepared (or so I thought) for a more cerebrally challenging experience than George Lucas's space opera, I've finally caught up with Kubrick's celebrated sci-fi 'masterpiece'. And I haven't been so bored in a long time.It's not that I need bucket-loads of action and excitement to enjoy a sci-fi movie—I have deep affection for leisurely '70s genre efforts such as Silent Running and Dark Star (both of which clearly owe a debt to 2001)—but Kubrick's film takes pomposity and tedium to a new level. Perhaps if I was stoned, as I imagine many of the film's original fans were when they first saw it, and watching on a cinema screen instead of a TV, I might have been a little more impressed: the visuals are undeniably awe inspiring, the music is grandiose, the psychedelic finale is a trip, and there is much symbolism and narrative ambiguity for intellectuals to chew over, but at two hours and twenty minutes, with very little dialogue and a tortuously slow pace, I struggled to stay awake.In short: give me a lightsaber battle any day of the week.4/10, mostly for the surprisingly effective ape-man suits and the highly detailed spacecraft model effects.",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Like no other movie ever made - SO DAMN BEAUTIFUL,"There is really no way to compare this motion picture to any other movie because no one has ever made anything like it and no one ever will. And it really should be seen in a theater to be fully appreciated. At the very least it deserves to be seen with a great sound system.I saw this movie on the day it opened in 1968, my senior year in high school. I went because I like science-fiction and wanted to see a ""space"" movie. Remember this film was made before the first moon landing.There we sat, waiting for it to begin. But, SURPRISE! There was no cartoon, no coming attractions. The theater owner at the Cooper Theatre for some reason chose to play ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" with the lights still up so we all stood, never did that at a movie before or since and then sat down again as it ended. Then the theatre went completely DARK and the strange overture began with the blank screen barely visible.The overture ended and my seat began to VIBRATE as the blue screen with the MGM lion appeared, along with the first deep bass notes, and then my senses were overwhelmed, hearing ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" for the first time in my life. The ride had just begun.(I highly recommend you watch this opening, this film, in a DARK room with your subwoofer turned up as high as possible to get the effect I felt in that theatre.) Of course, it took quite awhile before we got to outer space and the movie that followed was anything but a science-fiction movie. INTERMISSION came (a good thing, highly under-rated and unused these days) and we all looked at each other in wonder, caught our breath, and then the ride resumed, wilder than before.I saw it 7 more times within the next year, always in a real full size theater, like all theaters were before multiplexes. I might have been ""high"" once but I didn't go to see it again and again because I was ""tripping"". I went because I knew I was seeing a work of art. It was SO DAMN BEAUTIFUL; the sound that you could feel in your bones followed by terrifying silence; the sights unimagined and unimaginable; the affection for HAL turning to terror. And of, course, WTF was Kubrick really trying to get across to me? Years and years and many more viewings later, I understand it as well, I think, as I ever will. Read someone else's comments if you're looking for someone to explain it to you or search around the web, you'll find ""explanations"", that's not my purpose in writing these comments.What I hope to do is encourage you to watch it patiently, enjoy it's beauty the way you would enjoy watching a sunset while listening to the most beautiful music you know of (e.g, Gayne Ballet Suite or the Blue Danube); savor it like you would a wonderful meal, sip it like a fine wine; look and listen for the clues and the hidden symbols that ARE there. And then draw your own conclusions. Stanley Kubrick WANTED to SHARE some things with you that he found beautiful and he wanted you to think about where you. a human, came from and where you're headed.If that's too much work for your brain, and you can't see and hear and ponder the beauty and mystery of Kubrick's film, then, pardon my bluntness, but your life is about as meaningful as that of a tapir or a pre-monolith ape. If you want mindless escape, this isn't for you.But if you like sunsets, thunderstorms, harmonies in music, mysteries, and sensuality and can have an open mind this film will add something to your life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Masterful and influential epic film - and boring to those with inactive minds,"Sadly it appears that younger generations of filmgoers don't appreciate this film. Having been raised on frenetic, action-packed ""science fiction"" films like the Star Wars and Matrix series, and having spent too much time immersed in the chaotic frenzy of video games, they finally sit down to ""2001"" and are bored and frustrated by it. Well, naturally, if you're used to films in which every three seconds there is a crash, a special effect, a sex joke, an explosion or a killing - then you attempt to watch a slow, ponderous film like ""2001"" you're going to get bored. For those people, this is an education in what cinema can be. Science fiction doesn't have to be horror, comedy or martial arts. It can be literature and philosophy. ""2001"" dares to ask meaningful questions of the viewer, for example, ""What is mankind's place and purpose in the universe?"" And it doesn't provide all the answers. It challenges the viewer to come up with his/her own answers. Other issues, such as man vs. machines of man's invention, and the possibility of higher ""intelligence"" than man existing, are also also addressed but not given pat or preachy answers. The ambiguity is part of the appeal of this film, in addition to the spectacular visuals. The slow pace and long scenes give the viewer a chance to digest and contemplate what he/she has just seen and heard, while the film is still in progress. The long scene of the spacewalk with the only sound being the astronaut's breathing is intended to make the viewer a little uncomfortable. The extended special effects sequence near the end is almost like taking a hallucinogenic drug, but without the need to actually take one. This film, like other wide-screen epics (Lawrence of Arabia et. al.) really needs to be seen in a theater with a large screen and good sound system, or at least on a large, high-quality video screen with good sound. I was lucky to get to see it at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood in 1973, and it was shown with an intermission - and the soundtrack included an ""overture"" which was played before the curtain even went up, and also at the end of the intermission, to help set the mood. Of course the cinematography is masterful - space travel never looked this elegant or beautiful, in any other film save possibly ""Apollo 13."" Beyond that, it is the intellectual challenge that the film presents to the viewer that makes this film so memorable.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Under-appreciated - but still a little slow.,"I just watched 2001 on TMC (one of many viewings over the past 20 years or more). I've always liked the movie, and I've always appreciated the symbolism and art of the movie, and I've always felt that this movie is largely under-appreciated by most people. But I still have to say that there are places where this movie is just too dog-gone slow. The non-dialogue, artsy-type scenes of this movie could be cut as much as in half or more at times without really affecting the overall mood and communication of symbolism.For example, the scene where Dave travels through space & time at the end - does it really have to drag on as long as it does? Or is this just a chance to show a 1968 audience some really groovy psychedelic effects? The extended version of this movie has no dialogue for the first 45 minutes! Yes, 45 minutes! OK, we get it. Dawn of man. Monolith appears. Intelligence is sparked in primitive man. Man uses intelligence to fashion tools for hunting, crafting, and killing each other. We get it. Next scene, please.Well, that's enough comment from me. I have to go take my ritalin now. ;-)",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""On the Origin of Species"" written in a perfect picture language","In '2001:A Space Odyssey' the following theory was put: The process of evolution goes not always straight and successionaly but it moves sometimes spasmodically and suddenly. A question about it is whether those evolutional leaps are inherent in the process of evolution, i.e. driven by internal evolutional forces, or they are driven by some certain external forces. In this movie Kubrick and Clarke take the second hypothesis (But, of course, it doesn't automatically mean that they really think so). The further question 2001 puts is whether an organic-biological being/entity alone can have a consciousness. To that question the computer HAL gives a clear answer with 'No'.Actually no one could answer such questions clearly, but who does NOT ask him-/herself sometimes in his/her life?: Where mankind is from and where mankind is going to go? What the consciousness is, what 'one's self' is?In 2001 that profound and philosophical questions are 'written' in a perfect picture language. I don't know any other movies that succeeded in visualizing such deep, 'eternal' questions so perfectly.It was more than 25 years ago when I saw this movie for the first time, but I am still asking myself how and when we mankind will leap to the another evolutional stage.And I'd like to know what Charles R. Darwin would have said about this movie .",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Yet every time I see this movie it's like seeing it for the first time again.

An Epic Film Too Ambitious for its Own Good.,"""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is set in the year 2001 and the main character is HAL. HAL is a computer. That's right, a computer who talks and thinks entirely on its own. This was made in 1968 and to think by 2001 it would be conceivable that computers would talk is a joke. If this was in 3064 a talking computer that had emotions and made its own decisions would be considered just as moronic as this. There is nothing in this film that provokes any kind of emotion. It provokes two reactions and one is called sleep. The film starts with nothing but a pitch black screen for well over two minutes. Then, the first shot we see that has some kind of lighting is ""The Dawn of Man"" sequence. So, if it's in chronological order, the blackness prior to this, is the birth of the world?During ""The Dawn of Man"" sequence, out of no where, a huge rectangular block comes from out of the ground, from the sky, we'll never know where it comes from, but for one reason or another it's there. The monkeys go apesh!t once they find this huge rectangular block that only man could have made, but that's the catch man hasn't evolved yet. So, who made it and where did it come from? What is its purpose? The monkeys find a tool. The monkeys use bones to fight an opposing group of monkeys. The monkeys with the weapons are now the dominating group. Why? Because they have used their mind to gain an advantage. The more advanced monkeys, and more importantly, smarter and more innovative monkeys, are the dominate group as they have taken over the watering hole.We quickly jump into space, millions of years later, where we see a bunch of spaceships floating around to classical music. We can see the earth, the moon, the sun, the universe. And for a film made in 1968 the visual effects are stunning. The score is legendary. The cinematography is spectacular. The editing is, however, atrocious. There are countless shots of boxy looking space ships floating in outer space for, what feels like, an infinite amount of time. Once we board the ship there isn't much to talk about. For the next hour Kubrick shows various shots of life in outer space. Kubrick shows us the life of an astronaut, which is very boring, and we completely get the message. The spaceships interior and exterior are bulky and outdated looking. Remember what the first cell phone looked like? Me neither, but that's what the future looks like in 2001. All the characters have clothes and hairdos that resemble 1968. The chairs are decorated in bright red colors, and they're oddly shaped because we all know, in the future, we're going to be sitting in weird looking chairs. The computer screens are hideous looking and this is obviously prior to HDTV because the clarity is atrocious. All the TV sets look like they're from 1968, so it's not all that futuristic. Like all films set more than 20 years in advance, they look terrible and unconvincing. Just because this is Kubrick, we shouldn't say, ""Well, that's how you would think it looks."" No, I wouldn't. Just like I wouldn't think a computer would be talking to me in the year 2047. It's not going to happen and if someone made a film right now, set 30 years in time, and had a talking, self thinking computer, I would laugh at the stupidity of it. Just like I did with ""2001"".HAL is the liveliest person- shoot I just called him a person. HAL is a computer, but he has more life than any of the muted characters in this film. And HAL actually thinks he's alive. He sees humans as his maintenance men who take care of him while he does all the work. HAL ""reads"" the lips of one of the very few conversations between Dave and Frank and he ""sees"" that they are planning to turn him off. This is where the only dramatic part of the film enters- An ensuing battle between a red light and a guy in a spaceship trying to get into a bigger spaceship. Oh, the drama!! Once HAL thinks he has the upper hand, Dave makes his way back into the spaceship proving mans ingenuity. Dave proceeds to terminate HAL. HAL pleads for his life as he slowly fades away, which, like everything else, seems to take forever. If the scene was shortened I think it could have been truly incredible.The final act is just as tedious as the first two. The huge block that the Apes found appears again at the end. It comes out of nowhere... again. Then, an infant is born in a placenta-like shield overlooking the earth from space. What is Kubrick saying? Is it about transformation? Dave to an infant? Is man evolving again? Is Kubrick saying this is the end of man and the start of whatever that alien looking thing is? Maybe I'm going crazy trying figure out what this crazy director is trying to say, but the more I think about it the more the beginning and the ending make sense. There are a few questions left unanswered, especially for the purpose of the blocks, but if you can make it through the film it should spark some thought.The film moves at a snail's pace. The first act and the third acts are fairly strong, but the second act meanders around, hovering in one place for what seems like eternity. There is some intriguing ideas in the film that will provoke some thought if you give it a chance. And for that, it finds some level of profound greatness.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Wow,"I am speechless. I don't know what to say. This is amazing. This a film that takes your brain, chops it into little tiny pieces, puts it back together perfectly, and puts back in your head at the end of the movie. It is so strange that I love it so much. By the end of the movie I felt like I was a different person. I was still exactly the same, but something felt different. It moves slowly, but that lets you feel every moment of it. The use of sound in the film is the best I have ever heard. The music and sound editing is just amazing. The visuals for the time sent sci-fi in a new kind of direction. Hal-9000 is one of the greatest villains ever. I could go on for days. This film is amazing.4 stars out of 4",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Thus spoke Kubrick,"Considered one of the most significant pieces of cinema ever made, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is a philosophical magnum opus. The genius of its creation can easily explain a lot about people finding it a ""boring"" experience.
How often do you stumble upon people reading philosophical books which they find interesting? How often do you find people contemplating the abstract concepts and intuitions such as metaphysics and science?In a world enjoy being spoon-fed via the mass media and the dazzling technology, it is quite common to consider the Kardashians as popular and the Marvel universe as compelling.
These unpleasant remarks are even a sign that this movie is a great success. One that you can still relate to 50 years later. A little too close to the bone for anyone pondering over the future of the modern homo sapiens. A question yet to be answered for the ages to come.The Croatian-American philosopher, Daniel Kolak, considers philosophy to work as a plow in the farm of the mind. It rather raises questions than provides answers. This is how you should be prepared to face this movie. As Roger Ebert says: ""What he had actually done was make a philosophical statement about man's place in the universe, using images as those before him had used words, music or prayer. And he had made it in a way that invited us to contemplate it -- not to experience it vicariously as entertainment, as we might in a good conventional science-fiction film, but to stand outside it as a philosopher might, and think about it.""As for me, after watching a considerable number of movies, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" stands out as one of the most captivating movies I ever saw to this day.
Never have I seen a movie whose final scene is as magnificent and genius as this movie. The climax of the story being patiently and meticulously told here is its very ending. The cinematic definition of the word ""awe"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"recently, I saw ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" for the third time, but understood it for the first","For a long time, Stanley Kubrick's most influential and controversial movie, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", was a befuddling enigma to me. I've pondered over the movie for ages now, trying to reason really what it was about and more importantly, what I thought of it. A few moments ago, I saw the movie for the third time, but for the first time I understood it and I understood why it has gone on to become one of the most celebrated movies of all time. I'll be honest; for a long time, I didn't think much of ""2001"" and now that I look back on those previous two experiences of watching it, I feel a little embarrassed that I was so far off the mark before. I just had to learn that ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" was not a film to be taken at face value; it was about something else. And that something else cannot be determined by a majority. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is about the individual's relation to the universe around him, and because human minds are as infinite as the stars, they are just as varied.I always knew what ""2001"" was about in plot. It's a movie that is about humankind and man's relationship to the universe, composed of three stories that are interconnected in one of the most cosmically fascinating manners. The first part of the story concerns the dawn of man. The second relates to man's discovery of an artifact on the moon, hinting that maybe man is not the only intelligent being in the universe. The third revolves around a mission to Jupiter, in which the ship's computer, the famous villain HAL 9000, turns on the astronauts. And from here a fourth, most symbolic and controversial story emerges. That's what ""2001"" is about. *in plot.* What's it's *really* about is up to you.""2001"" means something a bit different to everybody. Some even think it has some religious (or even anti-religious) subtexts. Personally, I don't think so. To me, ""2001"" is about mankind's progress, but only in scientific terms. To my mind, it's about the progression of man from being a dumb brute to realizing that he possesses something that is greater than the stars and planets and his own machines that physically dwarf him in the universe. And the mysterious black monoliths whose origins go unexplained throughout the film are sort of like milestones in man's progress. And his progress is not his technological advances, but his intellectual ones. Throughout the movie, there is lots of symbolism about man's intelligence and how he uses it to overcome obstacles that lay before him. That's what it means to me.""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is a different kind of masterpiece. It does not work, as Roger Ebert noted, on a human level. The characters are flat and two-dimensional, acting is amateurish, there is not an extreme amount of development, but it doesn't really matter in a movie like this. The movie utilizes visual means to carry an impact to the audience and somehow this makes the movie even more powerful. I do think it would be even more of a masterpiece if it did work on a human level, but then the already stretched running time might slow down some more. Ironically enough, the most charisma and the most emotion comes not from our astronauts, but from HAL, the monotonous-voiced computer who turns lethal when threatened with his own ""life."" Stanley Kubrick won the only Oscar in his career not for directing, but for the special effects, which are jaw-dropping even by today's standards. They are especially awesome today, forty-some years since the movie's debut, because it staggers the imagination to wonder how they could have been done in the 1960s. But what makes these effects so special is not the mere fact that they are eye candy, but because they are used with imagination and delicacy so even the four-plus-minute sequences where very little besides objects floating in outer space coupled with Johann Strauss's waltzes can be mesmerizing.It took me a long time and three views, but at last I do understand why people cherish ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" Not only is it a truly mesmerizing film, but it's a deeply symbolic one about man's folly and success. But what's best of all is that it means somethingand not something definite, but individualized. It meant something to its creators and it means something different to us as individuals. That's an odd parallel to life, isn't it? Now for some, the movie is too long and I agree the running time is a little stretched and Kubrick might have done the film some good if he chopped a few sequences of space exploitation, but overall, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is an amazing accomplishment not merely in special effects, but in cinema. It's a different kind of masterpiece – one that takes some getting used to it – but it is a marvel much like outer space itself.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A visual and auditive spectacle,"This movie is just beautiful. Stanley really shows he is a genius in the way that he sets up his shots. All of his shots are beautiful, I cant stress it enough. The camera work is marvelous and really helps you understand character motivations (specially HAL 9000, who is just a computerized voice). The colours used in this film are also beautiful. Every shot feels alive and genius.The score is amazing. It has some of the most famous classical music ever put to film, and it really helps set up the mood for certain scenes and really gives you the chills.The special effects are amazing for the 60's, I would even say they look very similar to the effects of Star Wars. It really amazes you how they did certain shots.Of course, the real juice in this movie is the symbolism and themes. This movie is packed with themes about humans, technology, instinct, and existence itself. I saw this movie about 3 days prior to writing this review, just to make sure I understood the themes, I had to ponder for quite a bit and really analyze the film, and it still left me with questions. Actually, the movie is made to raise more questions than it answers.I would say, that this movie is a thought time if you are not a complete film fanatic. The pace is very slow, for you to be able to appreciate every shot, and most of the parts would make people that are not really interested in film as an art form, pretty boring.

Who cares if your computer can draw - Where's the respect the real artists!?2001 is still the most accurate depiction of space exploration by humans in this century (even if Kubrick's idea of fashion is a bit screwed up).

"Kubrick's ""Black Square""","I normally keep my movie thoughts to myself but this movie affected me to the point of voicing myself out.Movies are typically evaluated via (i) more/less objective attributes (plot, ideas, action, cinematography, etc.) and (ii) emotional impressions they leave. While the latter is extremely personal and diverse, some convergence can be achieved in the former. Unfortunately, this piece greatly fails in it: no plot, no original ideas, no action, horrible cinematography, and a very repetitive soundtrack. As far as the emotional impression goes: well, in my case, it gave me a highly unpleasant aftertaste: a very pretentious schizophrenic nightmare...Why is it so overrated then? I'd hypothesize that it is for the same reason as in the case of Malevich's ""Black Square"". When one sees something a piece of ""art"" of that type, there seem to be two typical reactions: (i) ""There is nothing there, it is junk."" and (ii) ""There is nothing there but it must be great because everyone else thinks it's great. Then it must be an art."" So what created this mob fame effect for this movie? I don't know for sure but it might have been the big names of S.Kubrick and A.Clark. Once such a ""snowball"" starts rolling down the hill and picks up the momentum, it is more difficult to stop it than to roll with it.Please trust your own independent feelings.

A symphony,"I saw 2001 for the first time at the age of 11, and quit some time after the docking sequence. It was slow, didn't make any sense, lacked any form of action (dramatically or otherwise) and I couldn't relate to the characters. There wasn't even a single good line in sight.I gave it another chance at the age of 18 and this time I was ready for it. It showed me that time could be just as impressive as the vastness of the universe. It told me about the nature of humans and life, about what is history and therefore, what is not. At the same time, it celebrated and mocked human intelligence and science.But mostly, it made me realize humans are part of this universe. There's no clear division between us humans, what we call nature and the universe. Fairly basic, I admit, but everyday news often leads you to belief differently.For the first time I watched a movie that wasn't about the plight of individuals or groups of people, but about the human race.This must be one of the most pretentious movies and to succeed in such an enterprise is beyond comprehension. If compared with music, it didn't behave like a rock-song, but a symphony which has many layers and ways to appreciate it. And like a true classic, it stands alone.Are there any mistakes ? Not a real mistake, but something that could have been done differently.

"phenomenal, groundbreaking a masterpiece.","A culturally significant masterpiece of its time. 2001 A space odyssey is quite possibly the greatest science fiction film (and book) of all time. When people mention the notion of space travel in film this movie arguably one of the greatest of the 20th century always springs to mind. Just the ideas and themes presented in this film are truly ground-breaking. Before we had Gravity, interstellar, star wars, we had 2001, the film that started it all. From the dawn of time sequence where the film begins we soon witness one of the most awkward plot changes in cinematic history. Suddenly we are thrust into outer space, into the modern era witnessing a spacecraft descending into a space station and we soon witness a group of astronauts on a journey to the planet Jupiter. Kubrick's attention to detail and predictions of future technologies were simply spot on. The video phone in the space station, recognise that? It's what we now know as Skype. There doesn't have to be a lot of dialogue for one to understand the very notion of what is happening during the film in fact at least half an hour of the film there is no dialogue whatsoever. I wouldn't even consider there to be a lead actor in the film, in actual fact the central character in this film happens to be an artificial intelligent being known as the ""HAL-9000"", the central computer that helps the crew control their ship en route to Jupiter. 2001 A space Odyssey set the benchmark for idea of 'Man Vs Machine' and these ideas were later evident in future works such as Bladerunner and Bicentennial man. Also we must remember this film was released before the days of flashy CGI style special effects yet the way Kubrick gave you the sensation of being in outer space was just awe inspiring. Not to mention quite possibly one of the most spectacular uses of Strauss's music in cinematic history. This film does everything a science fiction film should. It also was the first film to get all of the science behind space travel accurate. So if you haven't already done so, do yourself a favour and watch this groundbreaking, phenomenal film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The best movie that has ever graced these eyes.,"I don't even know how do describe this film. It is, without a doubt, the best movie I have ever seen. It is also the most confusing, creative, astonishing, and wonderful as well.For my entire life I've been looking for a movie as bizarre and beautiful as this film. I never expected to find it in a space film made in the 60's (although, that should have been the first place I looked). All I had knows before starting this movie was a general idea of some of the scenes (from parodies), and that it was supposedly confusing. Well, it was confusing, but in a very good way. It was mysterious and artistic; a real feast for the eyes, and on top of that it created an atmosphere very rarely seen in movies.This quiet, subtle masterpiece uses long and uneventful scenes to actually create the illusion of boredom mixed with wonder that the characters would experience in space. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed these scenes too, as I tend to hate scenes that drag on too long. What Stanley Kubrick managed to film was realistically boring scenes that, instead of just being pointless like most modern Hollywood dramas, had strong meanings. Plus, every scene had a certain beauty that only an artist would be able to create.So anyone who has yet to see this movie for whatever reason, go out right now and rent the movie. Don't think about it until you've put it in your DVD played. There will be plenty of time for thinking during this epic.K.T.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Movie magic.,"How do you put statistics on this one? This isn't measurable, because this is the art of human at its most daring and uncompromising state.I felt bad in the end of the film because I was thinking of what a talent Kubrick was, because of the way he changed cinema and because of how much he has influenced filmmakers, and it seems that everybody takes that for granted. They don't take it for granted really, but it sure feels like that because no matter how much you talk about Kubrick's talent and his achievements, it will never be enough to match his ingenuity, his knack for originality and so on.Inception it's a fantastic film, it destroyed ratings and blew everyone away when it came out, but think of how much Nolan borrowed from other films on it. You see ""parts"" of Paprika in it and you even see ""parts"" of 2001 in it as well. And I'm not saying that it was a piece of cake making a movie like Inception, because although Nolan did borrowed a lot, he did a great job at attaching and orchestrating everything in the right way. But when Kubrick made 2001 the world had never seen nothing like it before, there is sheer originality and imagination in it and it all came from inside of Kubrick, and I can't find the right word to describe what does that mean, especially because of the time of when it was made. And no matter how many directors will try to imitate him, they will never come close on reaching him, it's as if they follow him on Facebook and he comes out on Twitter - one of a kind.When you think of all of the great directors, Hitchcock, Fellini, Kurosawa and others, you would notice that the type of films they made were very similar. What I admire about Kubrick is that every movie he made was so different from each other, and they were all masterpieces. You can't find a more diverse director than him, always extending himself, playing with the genres like they were his yo-yos - he doesn't make the other directors feel in awe of him, he makes them wear diapers. He was such a virtuoso, always challenging himself on doing something new, and he did it with an ungodly artfulness and that makes him in my eyes the greatest director that ever lived.Filmmakers are storytellers, they 'tell' stories. In 2001 Kubrick decides not to tell, he goes even further and instead of telling he 'shows'. That's the reason why a lot of people find 2001 an empty film, because when you don't tell but show, you do not give away your point of view, therefor there is not a message for people to absorb it directly, they have to figure it out on their own. And this remands me of a great quote I read during my university days, ""The best teachers are those who show you where to look, but don't tell you what to see. "", and that's exactly what Kubrick did with 2001.2001 it's his most superlative work, a film for the ages. All of his films are amazing but with this one he had the audacity to break boundaries of film and he did it in such a poetic way, for one to just watch and admire.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Amazing, a true thinking man's science fiction film","I had no idea what this would be like the first time I saw it. I thought it would be boring and plotless, but I was completely wrong.2001: A Space Odyssey is the best film I've ever watched, Sci-Fi or not. Almost everything about it is perfect. If it wasn't for 2001, current science fiction would be more ""fun with strings and fishbowls"" nonsense.The special effects and models still look good today. The attention to detail on the spacecraft interiors is near obsessive. One one could sit through a viewing just pointing out tiny details on the monitors. But that's not really the point of this film.In fact, 2001 isn't really a science fiction movie at all. It looks like pure science fiction, but not if you watch closely. There are several plotlines about evolution, the use of weapons, etc.I also seem to like everything that alot of people didn't like. Kubrick made a film that was made for people to THINK about, not a movie for quick thrills. Space is huge and completely silent; Astronauts aren't actors . Why can't people seem to grasp these theories? Critics blasted Kubrick upon release apparently for lack of explosions and no overblown dance numbers. Now no critic dares say a negative comment on 2001 or else ruin their career.The brilliance of 2001 has now deteriorated into the nonsense of ""Independence Day"" and ""Armageddon."" I almost wanted to barf when somebody called THOSE serious think pieces.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Magnificent Epic That's Terribly Misunderstood,"Okay, I've read enough viewer comments and can't contain myself. I'm a writer and a filmmaker.  I'd like to know where it is written that a film has to explain itself to you.  I saw 2001 when it first opened. I was with five other people.  We discussed the film for two hours.  When was the last time that happened?  For those of you who felt it was slow, so is space travel.  Get it! There ain't no Warp Factor 1. Secondly, the ending: has nobody ever read anything by Arthur C. Clarke? One of the recurring themes in Clarke's work is that any civilization sufficiently advanced over humankind would seem like Magic, or even Gods.  If you didn't understand the ending, perhaps you weren't supposed to.  Isn't it possible that Kubrick was giving you the experience of how clueless we would all be if confronted by an intelligence millions of years ahead of us.  Look, opinions are like rear ends, everybody has them, but when people put this film down as garbage or the equivalent, it tells me that they aren't thinking it through. Television and motion pictures are very passive media.  They supply you with 100% of audio and video.  Old time radio forced the listener to be imaginative and conjure up the picture. Surprisingly, it's not difficult to do that at all. Here is a film that dares to be somewhere between radio and the visual media.  It doesn't hand you all the answers on a silver platter.  Like a really good computer game you have to figure them out. Whether you liked it or not is your decision. Enough very knowledable people in the film world have viewed it and deemed it one of the great masterpieces of film. As many have said, it's an experience. If you can't deal with that, then go back to your five pages and a boink pacing, but dissing this film is a bit like saying Mozart didn't know squat about music. An opinion like that only make you look bad.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Endless, inscrutable, and outdated","When I first saw this movie as a teen, I really liked it. When I watched it today, I found it bored me almost to tears. While it initially was a tour de force in movie making and introduced a couple of advanced sci fi concepts of the late 1960's, it doesn't stand up well in today's culture.The plot is extremely thin, and could be told in very few words. The plot moves at a snail's pace. It was impossible for me, as a technically educated adult, to avoid spending the idle time spotting bad physics, improbable technology, and unrealistic events.The cinematography is highly touted, and it undoubtedly represents a significant step in the advancement of film art. Nonetheless, there are aspects of the film that I found woefully unconvincing by today's standards. Scenes that created high drama in 1968 are now sadly obvious fantasy that prevented me from enjoying the film.The ending is so obscure that, if you plan to watch the movie, I'd recommend reading the book first.This movie joins a list of others that I never wish to see again, and in fact, I regret having spent time on it this time around. If you are less technically demanding than I have become, you might like it, but you might still find it slow moving and dull.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Mind-boggling, especially for its time","One of Stanley Kubrick's greatest works - which is saying something - and still considered by a great many people to be the greatest science fiction film ever made.It is a film that takes us from the very beginning to the very end. Starting from space, slowly and majestically approaching prehistoric Earth, settling us in to witness the birth of mankind. And it keeps going on from there. All the way to the end.The one thing that impressed me the most about this film is its technical supremacy. This is a film that was made in the 60s. Computer effects had barely been imagined back then and they wouldn't be widely used in decades. And yet this film has some of the most amazing visual shots I've ever seen. I frankly have no idea how they even made some of them. Or, at least, made them without going to ridiculous lengths in set-building. And it looks great, perfect even.As for the story, it's a Kubrick alright. None of the man's films are what you would call fast-paced, but this right here just might take the cake. I enjoyed the beginning a lot. The slow pace allowed for the majesty of the imagery to shine and it reflected the slow build-up of mankind rather beautifully. But the space scenes did not pick up the pace, and I do think that they should have. Just a little bit. I get that the style is what it is and when the mood leans more towards horror, it does work, but I still think that the same story could have been told in a briefer fashion. Easily.Still, I cannot fault the film too much. It is quite unique in its mood, approach, story and scope. An iron hard classic for a reason and definitely an inspiration for all the science fiction that would follow. Owe it to yourself to give it a chance.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Music and Space: A Odyssey,"Martin Scorsese once said that certain great films need to be revisited at certain points in your life. A film you may have watched when you were 20 years old would give you a different feeling when you are 45 years of age.Well I did watch 2001 when I was about 20 years old. I admired the film's technical achievement but the film outside its opening minutes featuring the ape like creatures left me cold. The latter part of the film being even dull, the psychedelia enjoyed only by people who had popped pills.So after several decades I decided to heed Scorsese's advice and watched it on a high definition big widescreen TV for a more immersive experience. Again the technical achievements is outstanding and still dazzle, it leaves films like Gravity standing because nowadays these types of special effects is common with the technology available to filmmakers. Heck even my mobile phone probably has more computing power than that was available to NASA back in 1968.This leaves the story itself with the monolith appearing in different stages of history pushing human evolution. When a monolith is discovered on the moon it leads to a manned mission to Jupiter to find another monolith. But HAL the advanced computer sabotages the mission wants to get to the monolith instead of the humans so computers can enter the next stage of evolution.With the special effects on screen we have imaginative use of classical music to give us mood. It ranges from soothing to eerie such as when the monolith appears. Again as I get older I appreciate the music more.The film still has problems though. Obviously back in 1968 with all the effort they put into creating the visuals you cannot blame Kubrick for those lengthy shots of the space station or space ship. It does lead to pacing issues and make you feel bored. Even Star Trek - The Motion Picture did the same thing when it was released a dozen years later with all the lengthy shots of the refurbished Enterprise. However the story still gets lost as the film gets lost with its dazzling effects as HAL has to be challenged and then the astronaut enters the monolith. You then see the astronaut as an old man and then is reborn as a baby.I have no idea what it all means and maybe I am not supposed to know as its supposed to be all symbolism.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Visually stunning but not as deep as it pretends,"I bet that Stanley Kubrick spent the last thirty years of his life laughing his tuckus off that of all of his works, this one most profoundly affected the cultural consciousness which he consistently satirizes.Evidence of this abounds: witness the instantly recognizable creations of the computer HAL, and its synthetic voice; the character ""Dave"" and the line ""What are you doing, Dave?""; and the stylized score based on Strauss' ""Also Sprach Zarathustra.""There is no doubt that this is a beautiful, confounding picture that says something about the dehumanizing effects of technology. What *else* it says is totally unclear - the screenplay is often quite witty, but feels like it was never thought completely through. Of course, works that are incomprehensible are often deemed to be profound, and Kubrick seems to have understood that; in fact, the emergence of drug culture and middle-class spiritual yearnings during the late 60s allowed him to create something really huge and really vague, and pass it off as something really deep.The film opens with ""The Dawn of Man,"" where it is implied that man's evolution was directed by either a) an alien life-force, or b) a God-like creature, represented by a huge black monolith.The former interpretation would be the less mundane, more sci-fi expression, but the relationship between man and alien is never developed. Instead, outer space is a setting - an excuse for an excursion by scientists (who discover a huge monolith on the moon), who end up battling against a computer (HAL - increment the letters by one and you get IBM) that turns on its creators.What the monolith means, or what is is doing in outer space, is bafflingly unclear, and Kubrick never bothers to explain its presence. In spite of this (or maybe because of it), many viewers have hailed the film as a religious experience; many more time their drug hits in order to be stoned during the psychedelic final scenes.2001 does have something going for it - its special effects are masterfully done and may be forever unsurpassed in terms of the visual spectacle they produce. (Kubrick garnered his one and only Oscar for this film, for Best Visual Effects.)Also, this is a lesson in how to tell a story through images and sounds. Though it runs 141 minutes, there are less than 40 minutes of dialogue.But as a commentary on the nature of humankind and the universe in which we live, it leaves a great deal to be desired.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An exhausting yet rewarding adventure,"Perhaps ""exhausting"" isn't the best way to begin my description of what I believe to be one of the best movies ever created, yet I'd like to begin my review by emphasizing this movie is not for everyone. Every shot in this film, as is true for most Kubrick's films, is intricately put together and the end result is marvelous. The plot is nearing on mystical (even a little new age), but never becomes sappy or heavy-handed.

I'm Speechless...,"I don't want to give anything away because I want people to have the same experience as I did when I saw this, so there are **no spoilers** ahead. I originally saw this film in the cinema as a reprint of the original 70mm copy. I had heard no reviews of this movie, but knew it was famous by all of the references in pop culture (SpongeBob SquarePants, The Simpsons, The Phantom Menace, etc.). I had no expectations for it to be good or bad, but I was still excited before the film started.The opening title sequence was so amazing that it gave me goosebumps and made my hair stand on end. 2001 had the best live action visual storytelling I have seen in my entire life. My jaw was dropped during the entire first half and it was the first time I had ever been completely silent and did not talk to anybody during a movie. In fact after the first half, I did not know what to say to anyone. My mouth made sounds, but words would not come out. There were no words to describe my experience so I just said ""I'm Speechless"".My expression changed wen I re-entered that universe to witness the second half of this masterpiece of art. It changed from shock and amazement to determined focus. I was trying to find the meaning was to me, as it was never made clear. I thought It was about the constantly changing world of evolution, and more specifically, the evolution of man.This is what visual storytelling is supposed to be like. The little amounts of dialogue allows you to be immersed in the setting that it gives when dialogue is not present. It also makes the dialogue have more Impact. I highly recommend this to any aspiring film buffs or dedicated science fiction geeks or pretty much anyone who wants a new way to hear a story. My only complaint is the sequel, 2010: The Year We Made Contact. It was extremely bland and probably explained things that were not meant to be explained in 2001's book or film. I say ""probably"" because I left in the middle of it from being so bored.. On the topic of the book, the film does not quite line up with it, so I would like to also see an adaptation that comes straight from Arthur C. Clarke's novelized version.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Empty space,"Seldom has so much awe been directed at a film with so little to say. The message that 2001 imparts can be summed up simply: Intelligence is the element that made apes into humans and will eventually cause humans to evolve even further. Shorter still: Intellect = evolution. Not particularly profound. Not particularly controversial. Not even particularly original. Just a common sense observation. But director Stanley Kubrick's penchant for pretentious rambling and oblique storytelling invites viewers to make desperate attempts to look for greater meaning, which simply is not there. As the old saying goes: There must be a pony!Which is not to say the film is devoid of substance. Buried in the middle of the film is a Jim-dandy episode of ""The Twilight Zone."" When the astronauts find themselves at war with HAL, the computer that serves as both their servant and their master, the film -- finally -- develops into a compelling drama. The situation itself is suspenseful, plus, it lends itself to many interpretations: Man versus machine, man versus his God, intellect versus instinct, the future versus the present, etc. Dramatically, visually and intellectually, the film does, ever so briefly, live up to its hype. The heart of the film beats strong. Unfortunately, the heart beats in a body that is grotesquely deformed.For a film that looks so sparse and lean, 2001 is ridiculously flabby and out of shape. What is amazing is that so much of what is romanticized as being mystical and philosophical is really just contrived and sometimes just plain silly. The infamous black monolith is a mere MacGuffin, a gimmick that lamely propels the story and loosely ties together the film's three acts. The controversial and endless ""dawn of man"" prologue drags on far past the point where it has anything to say and yet still reveals so little about either the film's plot or mankind. The ""star child"" finale is, to be kind, cute, but no more insightful than the rainbow at the end of E.T.The adoration the film has acquired has an almost cult-like arrogance to it: ""The film is great because we 'get' it and those who don't are just too stupid or shallow or, well, just not one of us."" Yet, when pressed, few even attempt to venture a guess as to why the film is awe inspiring, brilliant and revolutionary. Instead, the film's defenders only make excuses for the film's failings: It's boring!  ""No, it's meditative."" The scenes are repetitive and drag on too long! ""No, Kubrick trusts the viewer to absorb the beauty and the depth of the images, which transcend conventional film pacing."" The ending makes no sense! ""No, the film defies conventional logic."" Why? How? ""Well, it has to, otherwise why would it be like it is?""The ultimate paradox about 2001 is that Kubrick is hailed as a genius because he has made a film that raises more questions than it ever hoped to answer. The mere fact that it is so vague in its intentions angers some, but it overly impresses others.  To argue that the film is great just because it can't be easily explained is no more honest than saying it is lousy because it can't easily be explained. And for my money, a genius is one who provides answers, or at least theories, not one who just asks questions.The irony is that even with all the pretentious hot air with which Kubrick over inflates his epic, he still gets his basic message across. To survive, the astronaut Bowman must defeat HAL, but in doing so he, at best, only delays his own extinction. The evolution of intelligence, even in a corrupted state, will be man's undoing. Mankind is doomed to outsmart himself.  And the same can be said for Stanley Kubrick.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Fantastic Art film...Mediocre Film.,"So, I finally saw this weird film and I still don't know what to think of it. I'm not sure if I liked it or not. One of the weirdest movies I've ever seen.

There is VERY little story, and the little that is there is not interesting.

I agree -- Greatest movie of all time,"Saw this movie nearly 50 years ago when it was newly released! It was in Cinerama, my parents told me this. (Accurate?) The movie screen wrapped around in 180* fashion! This effect was overpowering in a supreme way. It helped to increase the beauty and awesome power of the film. I agree with the previous reviewer that this movie is the greatest of all time. And to think that in 1968 man had not stepped on the moon yet! My parents insisted that I go... much to a teenager's rolling of eyes. I graduated high school in 1970, so the teen years and interests were in full-swing! I was so glad I went. My mother understood the movie entirely and explained it to my father and me. The movie became even more amazing to me! And I explained my version to my husband last night. My explanation is more mystical than he ever knew! Good fodder for couples' discussion concerning our view of the universe. Yes, anyone who finds this movie ""boring"" probably doesn't know how to sit still and think deeply. I am a ballerina (in my youth) and a medical person in my first career. The movie is like watching a long ballet beautiful captivating ballet. Two very graceful scenes would be the ""stewardess"" in Velcro shoes balancing a snack tray while walking down the aisle of the transit ship. So glad Kubrick used classical music! Another scene particularly dance-like is the scene of the modular ship (Ker Dullea) while trying to re-enter the mother ship. The slow, graceful turning of the knob to re-open is well- - like watching a ballet. The grandeur of the music and scenes in this movie overwhelming. I think the fact that I saw this originally in Cinerama stuck with me all of these years. The mind retains what it sees -- for me. My mind happens to grasp facts using photographic recall of details. (Not bragging -- my auditory recall is weaker.) I showed this movie to SPED high school math students in 2012-2014. They were mostly bored. I wanted them to be influenced in a positive way by this monumental film -- including possibly developing a love for classical music. The students who had parents/homes who talked with them (few) took it in and processed the experience. I do remember one boy who asked me questions about what certain elements meant. So one student and maybe a few more actually had an influencing experience. Well, that is one small victory for mankind! This movie taught me so many things -- love of detail and beauty. It established a strength in me. My father was a non-believer until his death. He told me that he believed Armstrong's walk on the moon was faked. I thought that was crazy. (Did he read something about them using Kubrick's sets?) Last night we re-visited this movie-- just my husband and I. After discussion, we both were once again riveted.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The visual masterpiece of all time.,"I was so fortunate yesterday to experience a miracle in the cinema. While thousands were flocking to see the latest installment of the HARRY POTTER series, I instead traveled over thirty miles to catch Stanely Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY on the big screen.  I've seen it several times on cable, video, and DVD.  But watching it yesterday on the big screen was a whole new experience, a experience that I will never forget. Some people will call 2001, Kubrick's best film.  I would disagree, I personally like A CLOCKWORK ORANGE as my favorite.  But 2001 is a hair-line fracture behind CLOCKWORK.  Both films are on my top 20 films of all time. I would have personally like to see 2001 on the Cinerama screen at the Hollywood Archlight Cinerama dome on Sunset Blvd. in Hollywood, but beggars can't be choosers.  Seeing it on a big enough screen was pleasing enough. How can I describe 2001 to those who have never seen it before? 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY is a film before it's time.  It's the most influental Science Fiction film of all time!  Yes, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY is more of a influence than STAR WARS and MATRIX.  In fact, when George Lucas was directing STAR WARS: A NEW HOPE, he kept asking his crew about the space scenes in A NEW HOPE: ""is it as good as 2001?"" This is a movie that was released before David Lynch's career began, that required several viewings to understand the meaning of the film. Like I said before, I saw the film several times, and watching it on the big screen last night, I discovered new things with the plot. What other person could think of directing a movie in 1968, where a computer is the most reliable and intelligent instrument on a space ship? And thirty-three years later, in the year 2001, the computer is the most reliable instrument on the international space station. Or who else could think of showing a video game of a man playing chess on and with a computer, in 1968? Remember that this movie was released when The Beatles were still putting out new music, the Vietnam War was going on, and San Fransico was psychedlic central.  Speaking of which, this is the film that is dubbed, ""The Ultimate Trip.""  Since people who watched 2001 when it was first released, would drop acid, run up to the front of the theater to lay down and look up at the screen. I pity Warner Bros. for not giving a full re-release of this film last year in 2001, (or at least a one screen per city re-release).  But instead releasing SCOOBY-DOO and BALLISTIC on thousands of screens across the nation, I guess money talks. But why should I mention those pieces of garbage with this film review? I told people for years, and I'll tell you now that I would consider placing a video screen continiously showing 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, with a picture frame around the screen and putting it in a art museum.  When hundreds of years eariler, artists like DiVinci, Monnet, Van Gough, and 20th century artist like Picasso and Dali would express their art though paintings, Kubrick did his expressing through film. This is one of the best movies of all time.  If you ever hear or find out that 2001 is playing on a cinema screen in your area.  I highly urge you to catch it the way it was always ment to be seen, on the big screen.  And I'm sure, Kubrick would agree with me.  This is one of the best films of all time, so giving it ***** (out of five) is to little for the praise it deserves.  But see the film yourself and be the judge, and I hope you'll agree with me.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Breathtaking mixed with boring,"For the following minute and a half, you see several pictures of sunrises and savanna landscapes. Like the audience couldn't figure out how to set the scene unless they saw the establishing shot three or four times.The next eleven minutes are occupied with the grunting monkeys. They fight, see the monolith, fight some more, pommel things with a bone. Supposedly they are prehistoric men whose evolution is being influenced by the monolith's singing. Not that you could tell if you hadn't read the book.*Finally* we get into space. Only to be subjected to twelve minutes of ships slowly spinning to the Blue Danube Waltz (A pretty quick-tempo-ed waltz as I understand, yet here it feels absolutely agonizing). At last we get some innocuous dialog and rather cryptic exposition about the government not letting people land on the moon. We are left to wonder about this for fourteen more minutes of Blue Danube and spinning ships and neat camera tricks with anti-gravity.Next comes four minutes of watching a ship travel over the surface of the moon and dock at a space station. We get a little more exposition in a board room scene that follows. Then we're back outside traveling at a snail's pace over the moon. A second monolith is revealed, again filling our ears with that horrible ringing (I had no idea that was an actual piece of music!). The monolith does its little light show and then the plot jumps forward.*Seven* minutes of watching the ship to Jupiter travel. By this point in time my brains had turned into mush. Could it be moving any slower? Maybe it's ""realistic"" to portray it as such, but we still don't need to see five or six different shots of the same thing to grasp the concept of its ""realism"". Let me tell you about this ""realism"" thing; I cheered when the secondary astronaut character died. Not because I'm a sadist and like watching people die, but because after five minutes I was just so annoyed at the sound of his darn breathing! I'm supposed to care about this character, feel when he dies! Instead I found myself waiting for blissful silence whatever way it came.Anyway, now we get to the most interesting part of the film-the part with HAL. Forget Dave the stick-of-wood protagonist. The real star of the show is that coldly impersonal, chillingly villainous, ruthlessly merciless bad guy of a computer. He's great. And the ""Open the pod bay doors"" sequence is wonderful. But it's too short. And it's not long before the director once again lapses into too-long goings on.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very unique and cultivating film.,"Every time I watch this movie I realize more and more just what a true work of art this film is. A work of art should be unique and carry it's own personal traits, and that's exactly what 2001 is, a completely unique and diverse sci-fi experience.It's got themes of space exploration, extra terrestrial life, reincarnation as well as more simple themes like betrayal of trust and man vs. machine. It contains a lot of artistic photography like long sustaining shots of space ships and the gateway scene still to this day is mind blowing. I can only imagine the impact this film would have had on audiences when it first came out almost 50 years ago.It's definitely a film you need to watch with an open mind, don't watch this the same way you would a terminator or a die hard or a pirates the Caribbean or a fast and furious movie. oh no, you need to expand your mind and completely watch this with an entirely different perspective because that's the kind of film this is and I was most surprised to learn that this movie actually has a sequel to it!You simply don't see films like this anymore and I seriously doubt we ever will again. If you haven't seen this film yet, watch it and be perplexed at one of the most unique films ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Ugh,"I have tried desperately to like this movie. I have been told over and over again by my parents how ground-breaking the special effects were and how mind-blowing the whole movie was. I can see how the effects were amazing, given that they don't look cheap and shoddy even today. Still, a movie ,where the first words don't happen until roughly 25 minutes into the movie, is making a huge mistake. The plot is incomprehensible. I turned around and asked my dad what had happened when the movie finished. There is only one thing that comes even close to saving this movie and that is the perfect marriage that is ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" and the discovery of bone as a weapon. Still, nothing can save the movie not the music and not HAL.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Groundbreaking - yes. Best of all time - no.,"I'll probably wake up in a gutter tomorrow after sharing this opinion, but this is not a good movie.If I consider the time when it was filmed - yes, I can see how groundbreaking it was visually. It still looks amazing (at least in 4K), and holds up extremely well, since all affects were practical ones, and of high quality, and they meshed with ""real life"" seamlessly. At the time it was an extraordinary feat, for sure.It also a unique atmosphere. Those ""silent"" moments, long panning - they do make it feel more ""real"". Amount of details also adds to that. And I am not talking about clutter (although that, too, to an extent), but rather amount of actions that are taken by characters when they are doing something. It is, indeed, realistic, and at the time it would also be considered a huge spectacle because of that.But while these things certainly mean a good art piece in general, I am not sure if they mean ""a good movie"". At least, to me a ""good movie"" implies a good story as well. This is more like a set of concepts with a lot of padding, that does not really deliver anything. That may be fine sometimes (I think ""Room 104"" had a few episodes like that, and possibly ""Black Mirror"", too, and those episodes worked fine as standalones). But I felt like this movie was trying to be more.The way it is structured suggests that it is trying to tell a story, first showing the ""background of the world"" (kind of), then zooming to a small piece of that world, and then zooming out again. It implies something of large scale being affected (or at least being carried out) by something small and seemingly insignificant. Conceptually it sounds fine. ""Lord of the Rings"" is kind of similar in a way. Or ""Dune"". And both of those are found boring by some people.But LOTR and Dune are ""boring"" because they tell too much information about the world (world-building), while Odyssey tells you... How people are watching news. Or piloting a shuttle or whatever. Which, to be fair, can be interesting for some, but it does not progress a story or bring any extra understanding or appreciation of the world of the story.And no, this is not because the movie is philosophical or anything. It tries to be, yes, but can't say it succeeds, but that's debatable, of course. I think main problem is that it focuses too much on mundane actions in a fantastical setting, that it loses its focus. It's like you are watching a reality-show like ""Big Brother"" or something, but instead of interesting interactions between the players you see how people are just reading books, listening to music or maybe assemble some furniture. Those are meaningful for the players, but not for you, the viewer.So, yeah, I get why it is an important piece of art. But as a movie I'd say its too niche than media wants you to believe, because it's not as entertaining as it could be.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Greatest Film Ever Made,"Just to repeat the title, this is the greatest film ever made. Unmatched in all aspects and kids should be taught about this movie in school, same way that they should learn about The Beatles. Some things humanity just can't live without once they are created. 2001 is one of those things. It covers every aspect of our evolution as singular man and as species of men in a perfect way without any hysteria. It's absurd to think Kubrick and Clarke had this in them in 1968. We have let them down, they expected much more from us in 2001. It's now 2016 and we are not even close to where they thought we'd be. How disappointing we are...",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Help me better understand this movie's greatness.,"I watched 2001: a space odyssey, out of suggestion from a buddy of mine. And I usually don't watch something when they nag me to death about it. Which meant I watched it with a negative mindset right from the start. That being said, I have nothing but respect for a movie with a fair amount of ingenuity and thought provoking ideas being crafted back in 1968. I was amazed and intrigued by a lot of the scenes as to how they did it - with what looked like just camera work. However, because of that negative mindset(as before mentioned), some scenes became horridly outdrawn ranging from sometimes five to fifteen minutes of random assaults of either complete silence or static/strange sounds. Instead of enjoying the obvious attempt to create suspense and atmosphere, it instead became a strenuous struggle on my poor head-phoned-ears.(SPOILERS) As for the plot and story, ,aybe I'm not sophisticated enough to understand the message between the first part of the lunar monolith, the journey to Jupiter and the second monolith. I felt like that part had little to do with the actual message of the film and instead was just that - a space journey(Well DUH. It IS the theme of the movie). I've seen a lot of films where the depths are endless and the message or meaning can be interpreted in many different ways(Ex: The Fountain, Mulholland Drive). I still struggle here. It just feels empty to be honest. The idea that an alien or artificial intelligence provided knowledge to prehistoric man or in fact engineered our species isn't thought provoking for me. It is something that I have discussed and theorized with friends and as an atheist it is an idea that is common nowadays. Of course, this film has provided many authors, film directors -artists- with the inspiration for this idea - so credit where its due. But, for me, it is a piece of cake that I've already had too much of and does not impress upon me anymore.I am very much for films where the director lets the audience think for themselves and agree on the fact that most entertainment nowadays ""hold your hand"" or ""spoon feed you the content"" throughout the whole experience. It might be nice to feel like a child again, but we have to grow up sometime and movies like these shakes that groggy dreamlike state Hollywood has forced upon our minds. I celebrate every movie, game, book that allow us to use our brain - but to me, as an atheist, this movie is not thought provoking at all(for the beginning of humanity's existence that is).The controversial ending(As someone said) is interesting and freshly new, as for my film experiences. I liked the idea that he perhaps was traveling in time, a wormhole, and experiencing his death/aging by seeing the future. Every time something happened, a sound, a movement, the most obvious his glass of liquor, he saw himself in a vision older and when the other vision saw him it became him. On the other hand, the camera's point of view could have been from the monolith the entire time in that time-capsule, watching him grow old or making him grow old to be reborn a new.I have a sneaking suspicion that the monoliths had something to do with HAL9000's malfunctions and odd behavior - or am I wrong on that point? There are probably some points I have forgotten and I'll have to watch it again sometime in a more neutral state. Right now it just wasn't that much of a memorable experience, other than the intriguing visual effects of the great camera work.Feel free to help me understand the greatness of this movie, because I don't want any negative thoughts of a movie that was the inspiration for a hell of a lot science-fiction movies and books.8/10PS: That ending deserves an acid-trip.

50 years strong and this journey still has plenty to offer,"There is not much new I can say that hasn't alredy been said in regards to the plot points and themes of Kubrick's magnum opus, so I won't even try.What I will say is that I saw this film at a cinema in Belfast where it is being screened to celebrate the 50th anniversary of its original theatrical release.I have seen 2001 many times on a TV screen and always enjoyed it. How can you not love a film with HAL? But seeing it at a cinema was a completely different experience and I was simply astonished by what I saw.Here is a film 50 years old and it looked mint. The set pieces are incredible and all I could do was marvel at what I was looking at. It really gave me a new appreciation for what Stanley Kubrick and everyone involved in the production crew achieved.As I said already, I have nothing new to say regarding the overall themes of 2001: A Space Odyssey but one thing I will do is recommend that if it is being screened in a cinema near you, seize the opportunity to watch this masterpiece on the biggest stage of all, where it belongs.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Kubrick's Masterpiece,"What can I really say about one of the greatest films of all time that hasn't been said already? The first time I saw it as a teenager I was left amazed at what I had seen but at the same time confused as to what it all meant. This was the first movie I saw that didn't spell everything out for me. It took time for me to learn to enjoy that. It's a beautiful film. I've heard it described as visual poetry and I think that is as accurate a way of putting it as anything else. The visuals are stunning. The special effects, sets, costumes are all first-rate. I recently watched it with my girlfriend who had never seen it and has tastes that are strictly mainstream. She was in awe of the look of the film, particularly given its age. Not enough good things can be said about Kubrick's use of classical music in this, as well. It's a masterpiece that deserves every bit of praise it's received. Obviously a film that every serious film fan has to see. It might not be to everybody's tastes but it's an experience unlike any other and, in my opinion, worth repeated viewings. For those of you interested, there's obviously the Arthur C. Clarke books that are worth reading but I'm also going to recommend you check out the Jack Kirby 2001 comics. They're trippy and lots of fun!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Deserves its status as a classic,"2001: A Space Odyssey is objectively a visual masterpiece; but for those who appreciate a subtler, slower story line, it is a narrative success as well. Does the movie revel in showing off its mind boggling special effects? Does it, at times, seem more like an impressive art gallery than a film? Yes and yes, but even 50 years later, the special effects are amazing enough to warrant the rather pretentious display. It is clear that Kubrick's vision influenced nearly all sci-fi movies set in space up through the 21st century, and the only things that clue into its date of creation are the costumes and lack of outrageous CGI monsters. The calm, long shots of space and the spaceship set to classical music allow the audience to take in every bit of the mystical, beautiful, and slightly intimidating aspects to space and technology that Kubrick wished to convey.
One of the main complaints about 2001: A Space Odyssey is its length and slow plot. There is no denying that the movie moves at a slow pace or that it is long (about two and a half hours), but whether this works in the service of the movie or not is as matter of preference. Admittedly, the style of storytelling is slightly difficult to adjust to when an one is used to the current space movie genre, which often entails exciting action and an ensemble of characters whose personal relationships form a core of the movie. In 2001, the suspense is much quieter, but the drawn out length keeps it simmering constantly under the surface. Instead of an ensemble cast with charismatic characters, the core of the movie contains one human and one supercomputer, HAL. Additionally, the cerebral nature of the third act is radically different from those of Star Wars, Star Trek, and other epic space movies. However, the story line is still thought-provoking, exciting, and fairly simple to follow once its unique form is accepted and celebrated.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Nonsense,"5 minutes of a blank screen followed by 15 minutes of men dressed as chimpanzees screaming at each other, an hour of nothing happening, half hour that is slightly interesting and another half hour of a bad acid trip.Out of well over 100 ratings on IMDb I have never felt compelled to wright a review before, until now.I felt very let down by this movie given its hype. Yes the special effects still hold up to this day and it is quite pleasing visually, however that's no excuse for the complete lack of substance.There is absolutely no character development and basically no story. The most interesting character is the AI computer HAL. The scenes drag on endlessly and the audio is terrible. 3-4 minutes scenes sometimes longer of nothing with horrible jarring audio over the top of them. I would bet you could fit all the dialogue for the entire movie on a few pages.Anyone that claims to understand this movie is lying, there is nothing to understand, it's complete nonsense. Even Kubrick's reasoning for the ending sounds like he made it up on the spot.I am a huge sci-fi fan and given that this movie is credited as being one of the origin's of the genre, so well respected with fantastic reviews I was expecting so much more. 2+ hours of my life I will never get back.",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
my little insignificant summary of 2001,"I will admit right away that I'm one of those idiots that hadn't seen Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY before this re-release in occasion of the real year 2001. I was very surprised by the film in the way it wasn't boring at all like some people I knew had told me. It is a truly thought-provoking, awe-ispiring work, always intriguing and unpredictable, standing head and shoulders above almost every other sci-fi film ever made. No other film I have ever seen captured my sense of wonder and my subconscious so deeply. I still can't keep it away from my thoughts. It is without a doubt Kubrick's most accomplished work to date (I have seen most of his movies). Using tremendously impressive effects portraying the starkness and silence of space, Kubrick made an unparalelled masterpiece, that immensely rewarded those with attention spans longer than five seconds.After a majestic opening title scene showing the sun rise up from the moon and using the enchanting 'Also Sprach Zarathustra' tune by Richard Strauss at maximum volume, the film opens with a 20-minute sequence showing the lives of a tribe of prehistoric man-apes. In typically Kubrickian fashion, the film calmly watches those animals, which are just about a few dozen thousand years away from becoming human, defending themselves from leopards, fighting another ape tribe for the waterhole, sleeping. Just when you think you're watching the wrong movie, something really unexpected and weird happens: the family that we've been watching finds a big black stone of some unknown material standing rooted in the ground. It is a thing of extraordinary geometrical precision, something totally out of place in this primitive world, suddenly appeared there with mysterious purposes. We see the apes slowly approaching the thing in fear and wonder; eventually they will find the courage to touch it. As all this happens we hear a menacing background music with ominous voices, a classic example of Kubrick paranoia music, which will be heard everytime mankind comes in contact with a monolith, as the black thing is called later in the film. After that the movie cuts to what seems to be the next day, and as we see one of the apes toying around with some bones on the ground, we hear Strauss' famous tune slowly coming up again: we know that something important is about to happen. The ape finds a way to use one of the bones as a weapon and starts thumping enthusiastically on the other bones, detroying them. The film assumes that we understand that this is because of the monolith: it is helping the evolution of the apes, pushing them to become more intelligent. This ape, who seems to be the leader of the tribe, then leads them to the waterhole to once again face the other, stronger tribe, this time with something they had never had before: weapons. The others come unarmed and their leader is killed by 'our' tribe's leader, who is armed.After this comes one of the most famous shots in movie history: the ape who has just killed with the bone throws it in the air and after following it for a while, the camera abruptly cuts to about four million years into the future. It is the year 1999 after Christ and man, in Kubrick's vision in 1968, has by then conquered space (unfortunately we now know that he was too optimistic about progress in space travel). Finally you understand a bit of where the movie is going, and finally the 'Space' in the title makes sense. The movie doesn't tell us it's 1999, but we find out later. With more classical music Kubrick shows us his unique, stark, and meticulously realistic vision of space. The camera lingers over spaceships and a space station, where we meet the first human characters and we hear the first dialogue. The man we meet is one Heywood Floyd played by William Sylvester. Something typical of every Kubrick film is that every character remains distant, boring, and hard to connect with; here the character development is even less important than in any other film he has done. We never find out anything about him, although he does have an important scene where he talks to others about an epidemic on the Clavius moon base: the people he talks with are similarly vague characters, who serve only to advance the plot. This criticism of flat characterization actually isn't really a criticism: part of the film's point is that machines like HAL, who we will meet later, have more interesting personalities than humans. Humans are supposed to come off boring. Anyway, Floyd goes to a meeting where he finds out that the hubbub on Clavius is caused by a dug-up black monolith that has been buried there for, you guessed it, about four million years. Humans were attracted to it because it sent out powerful signals. The thing looks exactly like the one the apes found earlier in the film. In an hypnotic, enchanting sequence we watch Floyd and his team approaching the monolith with the same sense of wonder the apes felt. Once again we hear that haunting music with those scary voices singing in the background. Floyd and the others gather around the monolith to take a picture, but a few seconds later they are startled to hear a piercing shriek coming out of the monolith. We see those men writhing with pain in their ears, and it's almost unbearable for the audience too. After that we see a shot we have seen before: the sun rising up on top of the monolith. We saw it before, after the apes had found the monolith, but I haven't figured out the meaning of this shot yet. Perhaps a signal was sent out of the monolith on the moon because it saw the light of the sun for the first time, and wanted to let its creators know about it somehow.After this sequence the film takes another leap forward in time, though not one quite as huge as the first one. The year is now 2001 and the title card says ""Jupiter Mission: 18 months later"". In another classic sequence, we hear beautiful classic music as the camera pans across the spaceship Discovery, and the film's central act begins. Everything that happened before is a setup for this part. First we see one of the astronauts running round in the circular control room of the ship to keep himself fit. Once again these people remain unknown and distant to us. They are Mission Commander David Bowman (Keir Dullea), who will play an important part in the story, and astronaut Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood). The film lacks any comedic punch in its dialogue, but that's just the point. In the Discovery ship we meet the most intriguing character in the film (and one of the most intriguing characters in any film), and he's a computer. It's the famous HAL 9000 computer which controls the functions of the entire ship, and he is given a chilling, appropriately soulless voice by actor Douglas Rain. In the first scenes on Discovery we find out that HAL is supposed to be a fool-proof computer, incapable of commiting error. Soon later while HAL is chatting with David Bowman about his doubts on the mission's purpose, he mentions a fault that he's picked up in the AE-35 antenna on the ship. Here's where the trouble in the film starts: it turns out that the antenna is perfectly fine. That HAL has committed a mistake is alarming to Bowman and Poole, because he could now make mistakes about anything in the mission. They close themselves off in private to discuss the situation. They ultimately decide to shut him off and continue the mission by themselves. Little do they know that HAL is reading their lips and so knows about their intentions anyway. So when Poole has to go outside the ship to check the antenna again, HAL becomes evil and doesn't let him in again. He floats off into space and dies. And in the most suspenseful and dramatic scene in the movie we see Bowman struggling to get back into the ship from the space pod he's in.In case you don't know what happens next, let me tell you that the movie actually becomes moving and dramatic. All the following scenes have gone down in movie history, but the final 20 minutes, where the main character is taken on a dizzying 'journey beyond the infinite', definitely belong among the most confusing, strange, enigmatic, and ultimately astonishing endings ever shown. Kubrick has so much to tell the audience, so many messages in his big final revelation that many audience members will be lost on it. I was too, and after being dazzled by its complexity I did eventually 'get' it, or most of it anyway. This is a rare movie that has the courage to skewer with our perceptions about life and our place in the Universe. It's too soon to say for me, but I think it will change my way of looking at life. It is easy to see why it was initially rejected by critics and audiences and later gained a huge cult following, ran in theatres for many years, and was eventually considered universally as a classic. It's a film that you might have a hard time understanding the first time around, but later buries itself into your subconscious and doesn't leave you. It's definitely the closest-to-perfect film if there ever was one, and it might even change your mentality and perceptions as it did with me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The greatest sci fi of them all.,"Stanley Kubrick's '2001 A Space Odyssey is the kind of film that viewers really have to prepare for. Well, thats what I tell people before they devote their precious time to watch sci fi's most admired entry. 2001 opens to desolate plains in prehistoric times. This 15 minute sequence demonstrates how ape-like creatures can use the bones of an animal to kill a tribal rival. During all this, a bizzare alien monolith appears and causes bewilderment amongst the primates. Just as the bone is hurled into the air to signify celebration, the film jumps thousands of years into the future as a space station orbits the solar system. We are introduced to Dr. Heywood Floyd (William Sylvester) who is travelling to the moon with the task of exploring a black monolith that has been found beneath the lunar surface. The monolith starts to beam a heavy transmission toward Jupiter and 18 months later astronauts Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) are en route to find answers. Like many of Kubrick's films, we see a lack of emotion and personality from his characters. But in 2001, it exhibits the fact that we may not be superior to the apes, but having access to better equiptment certainly gives the illusion that we are. The most impressive character is a computer named HAL. He is inquisitive, shows empathy and expresses concern toward the activities of the two pilots aboard the space ship Discovery. The actions of HAL that follow are etched into film history, im sure you have heard many impressions of the rouge computer. Dave confronts the monolith, transporting him into an unknown dimension, ageing him beyond belief, before morphing into a shining fetus appearing in space. Its questionable which segment of 2001 is the most memorable, Kubrick merges together an impeccable ensemble of music and stirring visuals to create a movie that doesnt play by the rules that other films adhere to. 2001 is a puzzle that begs to be solved, the ambiguity only adding to the overall brilliance, each and every frame worthy of a discussion, if not a debate.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Beyond what you can possibly imagine.,"2001: A Space Odyssey is a peculiar movie, no, peculiar is too negatively connoted and does not measure to this masterpiece; 2001: A Space Odyssey is a unique, transcendental, mind-blowing experience.For it to be one of the most memorable cinematic moments of your life, you have to watch it in certain conditions. I personally first watched this movie on DVD, in my couch, on a TV, with a normal sound system. The memory I recall from my first viewing was good, although it didn't meet my expectations. Because when you see everyone saying that this movie is a masterpiece, unique in its genre (what I actually said in the beginning) you then have high expectations and you do not only expect for the movie to be good, you are also hoping for emotions, sensations you can only feel while viewing this movie. Unfortunately the emotion, the little je ne sais quoi, didn't come to me nor to my living-room. But the enigma of the whole movie started to germinate in me, I wanted to understand what I had witnessed. However, the little seed only germinated and never blossomed.The day Kubrick's masterpiece blossomed was the day where I finally went to see it where it should be watched and where all movies exist, live and die, in that dark room where the simple act of pushing a door and sitting down gives you the power of becoming invisible to others and yet embark on a journey with anyone who decided to sit in the dark with you. Yes, the movie theater. I can still remember the state I was in when the credits started rolling: shaking like a leaf, my blood whirring through my entire body, hands shaking, leg muscles tensing up; I had just experienced a whole new feeling. The silences (sometimes boring) didn't of course miraculously disappear, but I can tell you, just changing sound system, I rediscovered this film. I recall hearing about a nun that would've watched the movie and never experienced such a religious trance, she felt close to God. I can understand her, although I am not religious at all, this movie has this inexplicable power, puts you under a spell.Kubrick also confirms by that movie, once again, that he is a master to his art, he excels and imposes his visionary style and ideas that are still relevant today. But to fully have a thorough 2001 experience, you should watch it at least two times but you must watch it at least once in a movie theater. So enjoy the fact that there are rereleases of the movie the 50th anniversary to discover something that is yet unknown to your emotional spectrum.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"In Space, Everyone can see You Dream","There are many movies out there so full of energy and self-conscious visionary bravado (films like ""Goodfellas"" or ""City of God"") that they perpetuate the myth of the greatest film of all time. Then, there are movies like Stanley Kubrick's ""2001"" that created the myth, and simply are.""2001"" is the prime example of why Stanley Kubrick is the greatest director of all time. He was able to traverse many different genres throughout his career, and in doing so created the mythic templates by which all other latter films in those genres would attempt to emulate. Prior to this film, he made the greatest satire ever in ""Dr. Strangelove."" Following this film, he made the greatest costumed period piece in ""Barry Lyndon"" and the greatest ""modern"" horror film in ""The Shining."" Throw in films like ""Clockwork Orange"" (another biting satire) and ""Full Metal Jacket"" (the best ""grunts-eye-view"" of war ever made) and you have the greatest director of all time.Here's why ""2001"" is the greatest science fiction movie ever made. The amazing visual effects and the set designs with their painstaking attention to detail still hold up to today's harshest scrutinies. I dare you to find a movie from any period that looks this good. It makes today's CGI laden films look like visual puke. It also presents us with a prophetic and realistic look at what might happen to our society as it continues to evolve and become more dependent on technology, and the quandaries of creating Artificial Intelligence. HAL, the super computer, is without a doubt the coldest and most profoundly dangerous villain ever to grace the silver screen.On its most simplistic level, ""2001"" is the most arresting combination of visuals and sound ever captured on celluloid. What make the film so transcendent are its philosophical and spiritual posturings on man's place in the universe and just how ""alien"" our first contact with outside intelligent life may be.

2001: Spaced Out Opinions,"Kubrick's sci fi epic has left me, like many others, divisive over it's greatness. My first viewing went as well as expected. I criticized the slow pacing and often irritating sound design, with a special emphasis on the confusing final 20 minutes of the movie. However, even weeks after watching it, it still wouldn't leave my mind. Upon recently watching it for a second time, I am starting to understand what Kubrick went for. Studying the film led me to see the philosophical themes presented by the movie. Themes of evolution, existentialism and creation. These themes were able to grant me a more accepting view on the film. As for the more materialistic parts of the film, the visual effects are utterly magnificent. If Kubrick intended to inspire awe, then that was firmly accomplished here. This whole movie is essentially eye sex, for want of a less-dirty term.2001: A Space Odyssey is one of those movies that gets better upon multiple viewings and hopefully, upon future rewatches, I'll be able to accept this movie for what it is...a beautiful exploration into humanity's search for answers",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Laughable,Kubricks' 'masterpiece' achieves his career ambition - in it he produced an art-house movie for those too stupid too appreciate real art-house movies. A humourless sequence of pretty pictures hiding the blandest of ideas. Nice performance by HAL almost rescues some respectability but the woeful nature of the rest finally wears one down. The most overrated movie of the most overrated director ever.,,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Another big screen marvel,utterly lost on small screen","I have always appreciated the visual marvels of this movie. The images are powerful and lasting,and the usage of classical music to add awe to the effects of mankind's venture into space was a very smart decision on the part of Stanley Kubrick and the editors of the film. HAving said that,I can think of far more engaging stories that have been committed to celluloid.The film,an adaptation of Arthur C.Clarke's 1963 bestseller,is probably best summed as a study in contrasts: the first,a dry look at the beginnings of man on Earth,learning to tame nature and each other,the second,mankind's utilization of technology and it's betray of man. The problems to me with this film are probably as much its most distinctive traits: namely,the pacing is glacially slow,there is precious little dialog and the visual image effects are drawn out to the point of tedium. If you are straining your ears for some sort of plot resolution or denouement from the characters involved,or seeking a central point of focus in this movie,you will be sorely disappointed.Having said that,this film is far better viewed on a large screen or an IMAX,because this film's qualities seem to befit a medium that allows for a sense of awe or wonder. Seeing this on a small screen broadcast or on VHS almost completely dilutes the experience.To true film fans,this film is AT LEAST worth a look or two. But I'd be lying if I said that this film was a very ingratiating film view",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
a huge disappointment,"as a fan of kubrick films of great kubrick films such as barry lyndon and clockwork orange, i put space odyessey in my video player with great anticipation....but what i saw was pretentious cinematography. there was barely a decent storyline (apart from Hal which i concede was very good).There were glimpses of a great film, like Hal which ive already mentioned but even as a landmark film which i also agree it to be (in terms of special effects), Kubrick relys far too much on his skills with the camera and showing what he thinks is clever and not enough on the story. i mean the discovery of immortality was a joke i have 2 say. i just sat there and i said to myself ""is that it?""",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
great  visuals without anything to tell,"I watched this movie with lot of expectation after seeing all hype. But totally disappointed. Though it has a great visual and also shown in aesthetic way. Considering the time it was made, the concept for future and the way it has been shown is awesome. It feels so real sometime you feel like being in space. But that's the only good part. It has no story or at least I'm not able to find anything, staggeringly slow, and the overuse of background music sometime becomes so annoying. I have seen lot movies with great visual but they are not worth mentioning just because they lack story. Don't understand why this movie has been treated differently from those movies. Forgetting about the time it was made, I feel it very hard to appreciate it. Then again it all depends person to person and we agree to disagree.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Incredibly well made, but insanely slow and ultimately quite boring.","'2001: A Space Odyssey' depicts the world from primitive times to the moment computers start thinking for themselves, and becoming superior to Man who invented them. This film will not satisfy every palate, and the ending is like poetry that needs to be analyzed.The film starts off in prehistoric times, and almost looks like a documentary - without narration. It then jumps ahead to the space era. Here, Dr Floyd from the National Council of Astronautics travels to the Clavius base on the moon. The purpose of his visit is to gather additional information to the possibility of an epidemic at the base.However, we would never know the results of his investigation, as the film then jumps ahead 18 months and we meet Dave and Frank on a mission to Jupiter. Their ship is controlled by a super computer called HAL. When Dave and Frank become concerned about HAL and plan to disconnect it, HAL takes matters into its own hands.'2001: A Space Odyssey' is a symphony of beautiful visuals and colourful imagery. Stanley Kubrick's vision of space travel can be considered the pioneer of sci-fi movies. The film also takes its time showcasing these marvelous visuals, accompanied by a classical score. '2001' looks incredible considering it was made almost six decades ago.However, the film concentrates so much on the visuals that it is insanely slow moving. You can easily use the fast-forward button at times and you won't miss a thing! Every...scene...is...just...so...slow... Apart from this, it also really wasn't all that interesting. The story could have been told in about half the time. And can someone please explain that strange ending? I can't imagine people were satisfied leaving the theatre back in 1968...Despite being an extremely well made movie, '2001: A Space Odyssey' was just way too slow for my liking, and I became bored. The visuals alone was not enough to keep me interested, and I was relieved when the credits rolled.",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Excellent Sci-fi movie,"One of the greatest Kubrick movie. I enjoyed every second of this master peace. If anybody ever ask me if there's any movie you should watch, its exactly this one I would say. This movie is really hard to describe but if you are at least a bit fan of Sci-fi or mystery, this should be your pick number one. The visual side of this movie is astonishing. Even after almost more than 48 years its still beautiful movie with one of the best visual effects. Even while its not that important side of the movies in general, 2001: A Space Odyssey still can amaze even the most demanding viewers. For me this movie means a lot. I am very thankful for such effort which Stanley had to pull to bring us this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Singular Achievement,"I'd prefer that you play the theme to the film when you read this review. Look it up on YouTube, if you will. It lends everything a deep, thick layer of gravitas; I think my review is no exception.Here it is, folks. One of those true event movies. A film that makes you remember the place and time when you first saw it. This movies revolutionized cinema in many a way, providing inspiration for the masses. While this is only arguably Kubrick's best film (I have it second), it is certainly his most important. Contemporary critics were stupefied and divisive; to me, that typically means one of two things: either you have a comedy film or dark, dark drama that heavily depends on individual taste; or you have one of the greatest works of cinema ever made, one that people just aren't ready for yet. i am confident when I say that this is part of the latter category.I'm sure that you know some of the famous lines or scenes from the film; the protohumans banging on the mysterious black monolith, the interactions between the computer and Dave, and the trippy sequence near the film's conclusion that ends with the main character turning into a starchild. (By the way, there are actual reports of hippies sneaking into the film just for that last third and tripping, which I find hilarious.) But this film is more than its most memorable parts. I mean, so are most films; but this film is all about the overall atmosphere and tone. There is little dialogue and little human interaction. This film is a cinematic experience; a film closer to Fantasia than The Social Network. The most memorable and personable character is a computer, for crying out loud. If you had any doubt that a good film could be made without any of the traditional elements of a good story, here you go.I am frankly surprised that this got popular, even in the sixties. It is nothing less than monumental, and one of the few things that I can truly, unhyperbolically say took my breath away. I don't think I need to say that a movie like this would never get popular nowadays, and it certainly wouldn't get the same sort of budget. this is a good time to remind that a movie being clearly from its era is not a bad thing. This movie swept in when it could and ran to the stars.Looking at the reviews, I can say criticism has not changed much in the last fifty years; there are still some who degrade an epic like this, unable to grasp the bigger picture. I am not saying that this film is perfect, but rather that it's beyond criticism; its faults are as meaningless as our planets in the grand expanse of outer space.To Mr. Kubrick, I tip my hat. And I will do the same to you, the reader, if you indulge in a film that grasps the spirit of science fiction like no film before it. This is the movie that showed that the medium could transcend its roots and take on a soaring life all of its own.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Masterpiece of film making.......,"After reading some of the user comments on this film I felt I'd like to add my two cents.I consider this film to be one of the masterpieces in the world of cinema. Would I want every film to be similar in structure? No, I would not. But that does not diminish the accomplishment of this film.I've read comments from users citing the film as boring, hard to understand, pointless & lacking in narrative.I feel these opinions are based more on the expectations of what a film should be and not on what the film actually is.What this film does and brilliantly I might add is to challenge the concept of what the medium of film can be. Instead of using film as a medium to tell a straight forward narrative, the film ascends to loftier goals.  I see the movie as a piece of art. Cinematic art. I liken the experience of watching 2001 as viewing a great masterpiece of art.I don't watch 2001 to merely have some science fiction author's hypothesis of the nature of existence explained to me. I watch it for the visual feast combined with the haunting score and challenging intellectual theories presented. Film is first & foremost a visual medium. The use of sound in the form of scoring compliments the visual for sure. But dialogue between characters is only relied upon in this movie when it is absolutely necessary to further the story.The film is not fast paced. But slow pacing in and of itself does not condemn this or any other film. It's what the creator does with the pace of the film that matters.In many ways, for me, this film is a ballet. Key scenes in the timeline of man are presented and there is this dance of life. Dance of death. The constant struggle to further the awareness of life, the possibilities of existence, the barriers of death of time & of space. It's heady stuff for sure and the movie only presents scenarios, possibilities. It does not provide answers. It only suggests what ifs. And it does it with visuals combined with a perfect score that to this day, inspire film makers & audiences worldwide.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I admire its theatrical scope but it has not aged well at all,"I bought Stanley Kubrick's ""2001"" on DVD along with the (far superior) ""Clockwork Orange."" I have watched it since I was a child and admire this movie for its theatrical scope - as a movie buff, this is a milestone for me and my viewing experience because it is a breakthrough in narrative and for that reason alone I am thankful. I will always remember it and always take it into mind as one of the best examples of a director holding an audience and controlling them in his grip.But (and this is a huge ""but"") it has not aged well over the years. Many of its scenes that depict space travel had audiences sprawled in awe - it was the first feature film to really depict outer space as something realistic (and man hadn't even landed on the moon yet!).But compared to today's films, it is not very good. It is corny, overlong and unrealistic. Back then, it was a reason to see the film. Now, it's not impressive at all. This may seem ignorant, but think about it for a minute - why should we praise a film for being ""the first of its kind"" when other films have come along and done the same thing, much better?I understand doing this to a certain extent - but to say ""2001"" is great solely because of its effects and for being ""the first"" is silly, as far as I see it, because much of it now just isn't very good. Cinema elitists enjoy explaining the reason it is still ""great"" because of its effects. The point they seem to always bring up is ""...at the time of its release..."". I understand this but _now_ it is no longer fascinating as it's been done many times since.Kubrick is too fascinated with long empty passages of nothingness. It's like some self-indulgent ego-trip - take the opening for example. Four minutes (!) of absolutely nothing occurring on screen, just eerie music. Finally it opens, like some sort of epic opera and we are shown the planet's eclipse with the famous soundtrack, etc.I find this incredibly poor storytelling, not because I think it's ""boring"" or ""too slow"" but because it is pointless. I admire long movies (""Once Upon a Time in America"" 4-hour version is wonderful) but ""2001"" has many scenes that go on endlessly, needlessly. There's a difference between slowness (any Leone film will be) but at least Leone uses this as a canvass for exploring something - Kubrick, many times in this particular film (and maybe only this film), doesn't really ""show"" us anything meaningful. It's like we're staring at a moving spacecraft for two minutes. I check my watch at three minutes when the music is starting to tell us it may be over soon and I think, ""Did that in any way actually improve the story itself, or show us anything useful?""No. It's basically bragging to the audience - ""look how good it looks."" Problem is it looks like crap nowadays.The critics tend to love this long nothingness because of its artistic merits. And I somewhat understand this - I can understand praising ""2001"" for its uniqueness, its powerful narrative. But the fact of the matter is that as a movie it's simply not very good because of this! It has dated very poorly. E.g. the space station segments - they are one of the only moments in the film with extensive dialogue. The ""futuristic"" suits are laughably '60s-ish and some of the ideas in the movie about communication via video, etc. are ludicrous.That happens in any movie after a certain amount of time, but ""2001"" almost entirely depends upon this. I feel the actual story itself is weak. Kubrick is at a loss for anything useful so he delays it by continually showing us exterior shots of spacecraft and planets in tune with classical pieces.It just gets to be too much after a while.This all said, please understand I am not putting down this movie. I still admire it very much for what it is and will watch it for years to come. But as a piece of entertainment, as a movie...I find it poor and self-indulgent on Kubrick's behalf. It lacks the satirical bite of ""A Clockwork Orange."" The end sequence is horribly outdated with drug-trip visuals (it was rumored to have been one of the movies stoners would go see on a regular basis!). Like everything in this movie, it goes on too long - look at ""Easy Rider"" and ""Midnight Cowboy."" Both have '60s/'70s druggie sequences but both end before becoming intolerable - ""2001"" goes on too long...My review may seem very incomplete, ignorant and contradictory but if I had to explain it all in summary I'd just say this: ""2001"" is a piece of art, but it is not a good movie in any way. I have seen art house films with better plots (""Punch-Drunk Love,"" ""Magnolia"") and more involving stories. ""2001"" is a showcase for special effects and directorial styles - but now it is very outdated and alienating and this is my biggest problem with it.I can't rate this movie because I would rate it 5/5 in some ways, but very low in others. As a movie it's simply not very good - as a breakthrough/unique art-house type picture it's a great example of how a director can control a movie to the fullest.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Masterpiece is the apt word to associate with 2001 A Space Odyssey,"In my opinion the greatest film of all time even surpassing the likes of Citizen Kane and Vertigo. 2001 is filled with visuals that will awe and frighten simultaneously and its thematic depth is of such immensity that even today 50 years later pages upon pages can be written on it. The film is based on Author C Clarke's novel but Kubrick makes the material his own. Divided into three distinct segment which encompass time since the dawn of man to the far future 2001 is a meditative experience which squashes all the expectations and clichés one sees in a narrative film. Kubrick's legendary status was already confirmed before he even thought of making a sci-fi movie but such is the reputation of this film that it towers over every film of even his oeuvre.

My favorite movie,"This film is beautiful to behold.  Beautiful pictures, beautiful music, beautiful direction all telling a  rather simple story about very complex issues.  For those who found the film boring or slow, you ought to know that Kubrick intentionally created a drawn out exposition of the plot to show how boring space travel and perhaps space itself can be.  Indeed, there are lots of jabs at techonological progress throughout, e.g. HAL spells IBM minus one letter in the alphabet for each letter, and the primitive bone-tool is juxtaposed with a space ship in what must be the single greatest jump cut in the history of cinema.  The excitement occurs due to conflict and is instigated by a mysterious and rather unnatural or even supernatural monolith from (?outer) space.  The monolith intervenes with the natural course of history at very crucial moments in evolution and human development leading man into a pursuit of the monolith itself.  We never learn what the monolith is nor do we know where it came from.  Is it God?  Is it alien life?  Is it a cosmic joke?  Regardless of what it is, man is simply obsessed about finding out what this monolith is, where it came from, and what it means.   Like most of Kubrick's films, this one is about human nature and it's mysterious origins.  At first innocent, later intelligent and, consequently, violent.  In many ways, 2001 is a retelling of Adam's fall from grace and, possibly, future salvation.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The GREATEST Geometric Sci-Fi Film Ever Made!!!,"Stanley Kubrick had absolutely no knowledge of the Science Fiction genre. 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) has been called the Grandfather of Sci-Fi films. George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and many others, have considered this film as an inspiration to their careers. The goal for Kubrick was to not only make an experimental film, but to take its genre very seriously (and realistically). Kubrick went beyond the limits with the film's photography and Special Effects.The framing of the movie is both geometrical and symmetrical, to a higher degree. Kubrick creates images that make us as the viewer question its meaning, instead of receiving an answer. 2001 may not be what people expect it to be. I also, struggled to understand its meaning, but the film should be viewed more than once. Kubrick takes us beyond our expectations, into something that is completely unknown.There are some things about this films that I do not fully agree on, but the experience was quite thrilling for me. There are some shots throughout this film that filmmakers are trying to figure out. I for one accept the film as an artistic observation, rather than it being a everyday usual talkie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
2001 : A Space Odyssey : A Magnum Opus,"Stanley Kubrick can be said as an Einstein of film making. 2001 : A Space Odyssey is more than a Movie. Its an unforgettable master piece, perhaps the most intelligently made movie of all time. More important for us is to applause Kubrick's effort as he has not made the film with a commercial angle but, instead brought out a learning experience through cinematic media. 2001 : A Space Odyssey can be said as a Mix of remarkable Documentary & a superb cinematic drama.The best part of the film is how Kubrick has documented the behavior in Outer space & in Zero-Gravity system. Its merely impossible to explain by words or novel to explain the behavior & perception which one can face in zero-gravity. When coming to fiction, Kubrick shows how humans in 21st century overcomes zero-gravity by using principles of centrifugal force. Difficult even to mentally visualize, but Kubrick & his team generously designed, crafted & shot the greatest scenes ever, of the Rotating Giant Wheel Space Craft & Discovery Space Ship's Crews Walking through the Rotating Deck.2001 : A Space Odyssey is a Film about ""Evolution of Higher Intelligence for a Need of Survival under influence of Unknown Phenomenon""The basic idea of Arhtur C. Clarke was that, evolution of intelligence on Earth, from Apes to Man was bestowed by some extra terrestrials (Aliens) and subsequently transforms them from man to the so called ""Star Child"" (Higher intelligence) at the end and after 4 million years.During a sudden Phenomenon in an early morning, the apes come across the Monolith, a Black Rectangular Object, standing erect on the Land. It was a very unusual object for the apes as in wide contrast to their present environment. The ""Curosity"" increases amongst the apes and by overcoming their ""Fear"" one of the apes touches the Monolith followed by other apes. Here is where they overcome their fear and gained confidence. Their brains achieves a second degree of intelligence. Soon after that incidence, the apes are able to ""THINK"" and then comes the invention of a ""Tool"", perhaps the best scene of the film blended with great music. With this ""Tool"" apes are able to fight and defy the rivals.The fast forward to 21st century visualizes the ""Civilised"" Man with his tool which is now sophisticated and in constant innovation. And there is a conflict between the man & machines (tools). Excellently directed by Kubrick, the dispute between the Discovery crew & Hal 9000 is remarkable.Try to understand our connection with the earth. If we don't have any tool with us we can still walk around and survive on land as gravity keeps us together with the Earth matter such as air, water & soil. But in Space, if one loose control of his tools, he shall not survive as there is no Air, water, land & gravity. Our organic form of life is designed to be in need of these.Here is the need of MUTATION. Its time, since man have reached its highest progress but is helpless in Outer space, there is a need for Another Evolution. A New species which shall require no tools to travel. And the Phenomenon again occurs after 4 million years.Jupiter & Beyond exhibits that ""Dave"" the last survival of Discovery space ship, after killing HAL 9000, visits the monolith and subsequently enters a new universe. This again unknown, Kubrick leaves on us to wonder. But the New universe is Multi-dimensional. In the present world we live is 3-Dimension and we are able to move in the space around us in 3-D pattern. This is the rule of our universe. But Dave's new world is Multi - Space-Time dimensional. Imagine if you could also have a Road of time in which you can move to & fro like the Highway on which we travel. The birth of Higher intelligence Life form is an origin from this world. Dave is influenced / mutated again the by the unknown monolith and incarnated as ""STAR CHILD"" in present universe which in the movie is a Giant embryo. Here is were the film ends.The Plot of the film is definite. A journey of evolution from ""Apes - to - Man - to - Starchild"" How it happens, Kubrick shows it as under influence of the Sentinel Monolith. But the evolution happens, Monolith is a fiction, but Genetic Mutation is true. Nature have always constantly mutated Life form to habitat its relevant environment. This is a story of habituating outer space.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
2001:  A Sleep Odyssey,"There are too many people out there who think this is a masterpiece.  I'm here just to counter that nonsense.  First of all the acting in this movie was a joke.  There were no great characters that will never be forgotten (oh by the way Keir Dullea acts worse than Keanu Reeves and Tori Spelling). Their is a total of five minutes dialogue in this movie, and six and a half hours of sheer silence.  Some people may call that art but i call it BORING. How can anyone like a movie where the ending is so stupid and out there, that you don't get it (a mouse must have written the script).  Hardcore fans of this movie will use the excuse ""that's the beauty of it, everyone has their own opinion.""  Ladies and gentleman of the jury that's not called beauty thats called turkey.  That's what i rate this movie, turkey.  Kubrick directed one of the greatest movies of all time (Dr.Strangelove) but this is a complete joke.  It looks like Madonna directed it.  I was so happy when the movie Airplane II made fun of this movie.  I think everyone should take part in making fun of it.  How can a movie make you fall asleep faster than school does.  That's downright sad.  If you want a great sci-fi movie rent Star Wars or Close Encounters of the Third Kind or Planet of the Apes or anything instead of this trash mobile.  The only time i would ever watch this movie again is if someone held a gun to my head and said ""press play"" (nahhhh...I change my mind, I'd take the bullet).  I was so happy when this movie was over, i threw a party to help me forget how bad it was.  I only recommend this movie to people who can't see or hear (it's better if you can't hear the five minute screenplay), don't worry you'll get it as much as the people who can see and hear.

The Greatest Movie Of All Time.

One simple unalienable fact that people must realize is that the differences contrasting between past and modern cinema are unlimited and infinite. The ever-present mood, emphasis and feeling that the 60s and 70s brought into movies is irreplaceable. In those days, if a movie was 2 1/2 hours long, the mindset of movie-goers wasn't ""Oh, this movie must be so packed full of action that the 2 hours will shoot by like lightning."" They were more along the lines of ""Okay, this movie is long, it is an epic, what needs to be said to us cannot be simply accomplished within minutes, things have to happen before grander things can happen, an we are going to be shown virtually every second of it."" The one thing people tend to forget about space and space travel and space technology is that it ISN'T fast. It cannot just happen as if it were on a timer as in the movie atrocity Armageddon. What happens happens at the pace it does to perpetuate the un-deniable fact that this movie, although a work of science fiction, is as realistic as it can be, regardless if it's about the possible futures that lay before us. These days, the audiences have been dumbed down by so-called logic in movies. It must all be explained to them, otherwise they leave confused and angry. Those who honestly dislike 2001 simply do not, or no longer possess the patience, nor the capacity to understand that some truths will NOT be merely dropped into our laps. What makes a fantastic film, the sole characteristic that classifies a movie as brilliant, is the fact that it leaves US to create OUR OWN meanings for why something in a movie is happening. The inner-depths to 2001's meanings range from knowledge of the universe around us, to the inconsistency of evolving technology. The rest is up to us to decipher, after we do that, we can believe what WE think is the true meaning.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Probably my favorite movie of all time!,"This movie has been my favorite sci-fi movie from the moment I first watched it! I gave it a 9 mainly because the performances could've been better. Sure, they're the less important thing about the film. Sure, there's not a lot of them. But they still could be a bit better. But the themes and effects overshadow them, making this the quintessential movie for all movie lovers (and not the ones who gave this masterpiece 1 star saying that it was mindless and meaningless; the REAL movie lovers out there)",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A great cinematic experience,"This move came out in the year when I was born, and I think it is still one of the best SF-movies ever made. The special effects are still outstanding, especially when realizing they were made without any computer, in a time - one year before the first moon landing - in which mankind had not yet seen Earth from space. The imagery is fantastic, and the story is mind-blowing. This is not a standard SF-movie with a predictable speedy storyline and a clear answer in the end; if you expect such a movie then do not watch it. It is a movie that shows space travel how it really is, made in a time when people were still fascinated by it and full of hope, with an intense experience that is truly alien and beyond our imagination. If you watch it for the first time, then watch it on a screen that is as large as possible and open yourself for a great cinematic experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Lifetime movie of the future possibilites,"This movie came out in 1968. I saw Dr. Strangelove on TV at that time and was blown away to find out there was such a director who wasn't afraid to make a politically satiric movie about the cold war. I originally saw 2001 in an old palace type of movie theater in Boston, got stoned in the lobby, with a friend before going in and only anticipated the light show at the end. It was so good that it left you thinking what the heck is he saying at the end. I read the book and just liked the beginning about the ape who was more contemplative than the others. At the time there was a book out called On Aggression and was interesting and popular because of the Vietnam War. Today this movie is too long for the younger show me now generations. I still think this is the best movie that was ever made about actually encountering alien, super intelligent life. I'm still wondering if Kubrick is saying it was an alien life form or spiritual awakening that is portrayed in the end. I'm glad he was into using the classical music sound track because it does take you away from the dumb human dialogues that come out in some SF movies today.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Sci-Fi Film that Never Gets Old,"""2001: A Space Oddisey"" is 1968 science-fiction film by genious Stanley Kubrick, the script was a colaboration between Kubrick and novelist Arthur C. Clarke. Time later, Clarke would release a novel about the same story althought you shouldn't take it in consideration when analizing this film.
I've never given a 10 in my life, and I'll never do it again, 2001 is exeptional in every aspect it's propoused to, the use of classical music makes this a movie without age, the wonderful photography, the magnificent scenes and space shots it's simply unforgivible; even if you don't understand it (which is/will probably the case) you can't help but admire the masterpiece in front of your eyes.
What is unique, is the amount of depth that this film can have, every time you'll rewatch it not only you'll find new details but also comprend a little bit more of what it is all about. At the first view it felt as a quick look at human's history, both past and future. At the second view I understood that Kubrick's made a comparason between our ignorance in our primitive forms and our behaviour in the outer space. Third view and I thought it was about humanity itself, you know, the AI as a new form of human thought, the fake discovery on the moon, the reactions, etc. And so on. What it is wonderfull of this take on Kubrick is that, as well as in 'The Shining', every one can have its own interpretation. In many ways the film treats the lies for self-recognition, the egocentrism of humans, our lacks of moral, our inmaturance, our insignificance, but in the other way it speaks about the screen, the proper mediums of cinema (althought it is very subtle), and so on; it is a must watch for everyone, specially because you'll be trying to find your way throught this marvellous puzzle we call '2001'",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best Movie I've Ever Seen,"This movie is incredible, I have never seen such an amazing film in a long time, amazing soundtrack, great acting, stunning visuals, etc...I was stunned when I realized that most of the references that I've seen in TV shows and all of that came from the film. The movie was so ahead of it's time, and, even if the movie is sometimes just filler, it's still the most important and most influential Sci-Fi movie of all time. After watching this film, Kubrick became one of my favorite directors of all time, besides directors such as Spielberg, Tarantino, etc... I honestly really don't care about the sequels, follow-ups, and any of those kinds of this, but this film will never get tiring and boring for me, it'll always amaze me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Beyond filmmaking...,"Perhaps Roger Ebert said it best... ""Kubrick's goal here is not to thrill us, but to fill us with a sense of awe.""  And no film I have ever seen captures man's universal meaning in a film as does ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" From man's beginning to his probable destiny, Kubrick has captured the essential milestones that may have and what could still shape the very essence of humanity.  And he does so very very much with so very little. This film, without computer graphics and hitech special effects, accomplishes more for the science fiction genre, than any other film of its kind, including the Star Wars Trilogy, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and Contact.For me, this is definitely the best motion picture of all time.  ***** out of ****.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Science Fiction At Its Greatest,"You've probably already heard all of the praise that has been given to this film. And, really, all of this praise is truly deserved! It is a beautiful work of art, and even if you didn't like it (which is perfectly understandable), you should REALLY still appreciate the special effects in this film. It changed science fiction film history, and just film history in general.I mean, if the Academy hadn't given the Oscar to Kubrick for best visual effects, it'd probably be the biggest Oscar snub of all time! Of course, I don't take the Oscars all too seriously, so it wouldn't impact my life or anything.The film is broken up into a few parts, all eventually being connected to a black monolith. The unconventional structure of the film makes ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" even more interesting.Besides the unconventional structure, this film is experimental in many ways. It has some pretty experimental visuals, filmmaking techniques (including a particularly famous jump cut) , and a powerful and strange ending that begs to be analyzed by everyone who sees it! While I'm not the biggest fan of over-analyzing movies, this is definitely an exception through my eyes. The film clearly wants the viewers to interpret and analyze it, and that is what makes it even more interesting.Kubrick is clearly one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. The already mentioned experimental techniques and visual effects have truly influenced some of today's great filmmakers. The film also has a genius use of classical music. The music and the visuals match together beautifully, A lot of people may believe that this film is boring or nonsensical. While it is understandable to have those opinions, I was never bored during this film. It has intensity, mystery, and, of course, beauty!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Tools don't need to breathe in space...,"2001 A Space Odyssey contains in two hours and twenty minutes what has happened to the evolution of humans in the past million years. You start with apes, whose primary function (in the movie) is the discovery of tools, albeit simple ones at that. You then move to humans, who, driven by their curiosity and scientific nature, venture into unknown territories after seemingly becoming the masters of their own planet.However, man, just like the apes, needs tools in order to function. Instead of the simple 'bone' for the apes, man creates computers, which become the backbone for this journey. Herein lies one of Kubrick's main points. Man invents tools; tools so great that they no longer need humans in order to function. Astronauts hibernating on the journey while the two awake struggle with boredom (i.e. sun-tanning scene). By this point, man has made tools so great that the thirst for knowledge depletes and is replaced with mild content. Hal 9000, the leader of all tools, does virtually everything now while man now becomes the tool. Man's function is now to observe Hal 9000, and fix it when needed. So the human is now used strictly for maintenance, while Hal9000 does the work.Kubrick's other main point in this fascinating work of art is that man, while being a master of his own planet, is just a baby in space. The astronauts eat baby food and have to be 'toilet-trained' (instructions on how to use the toilet). Earth holds no weight in space; man still needs to breathe to survive in a place where breath is hard to come by: back to the tools. Man uses his tools again to be able to breathe in this environment. Now it is man who is completely dependent on the tools he invented. Now without these tools, man faces certain death. Tools don't need to breathe in space...This film is both universal and timeless, perhaps more than any movie I have seen to date. It leaves room for discussion with its subtle nuances and reminds the viewer of where mankind stands in the evolutionary spectrum.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
we can only be grateful to have it,"No spoilers in case you're interested in seeing what all the fuss is about but have somehow managed to avoid the actual story.I first watched 2001 as a teenager almost 20 years ago, having understood very little, but remember enjoying the (seemingly) sparse show it offered.Couple of years later I got into Arthur C Clarke, starting with the amazing Rendezvous with Rama (how is that not a film yet??) before getting round to 2001. Oh my God, it's full of stars! At this line I understood what that whole psychedelic sequence must've been about, so onward to a 2nd watch forthwith it was. And lo, I now got the film much better. It wasn't quite up there with my absolute favourites (yet), but understood it to be a masterful piece of work.Fast forward 15 years or more to watching it a 3rd time (this huuuge film phase I'm having this year is thanks to procuring a HD-projector...highly recommended!).And ye Gods indeed, it's now my Number 1 favourite film.Older and (probably) wiser, in that 3rd watch there was so much more to appreciate: the use of György Ligeti's otherworldly music is hugely-immersive; the distinct, yet skillfully-linked, nature of each of the 4 parts of the movie feels like a proper opus; the epic presence of the monolith is fantastic, and - when you think about it - the utter vastness of the timeline is sheer incomprehensible. Above all: the film is hugely enjoyable, completely engrossing and beguiles like nothing else I've ever seen. Its ideas are as timeless as the universe itself.As with most Great films, it's also the little things that make an outstanding impression against hugely-ambitious intention: the apes' excitement when realising they can use scattered bones as tools; Floyd seriously cutting the gentlemanly exchange with the Russian group utilising a curt ""I'm afraid I can't talk about that""; the hypnotic circular weightless-walking (and running) of crew; the repeating trick of showing HAL's now-iconic red eye.Speaking of iconism: this movie offers an incredible amount of iconic culture. If you watch this for the first time you'll feel like you've already seen it, such is its influence. And for pure open-mouthed awe we don't even have to look at the riveting psychedelic wormhole: HAL's red room scene is the one that stays with us the most.To the 3 most common criticisms this film has:1) ""none of the characters are human/relateable enough, tho' some use this as a theory to posit this was Kubrick's intention, to allow HAL emotional room.""I don't buy any of this: Kubrick above all wanted realism: this means he wanted his astronaut and senior scientist characters to mirror the nature of their real counterparts: stoic, calm, formal. And check out Dave's stress levels later on, he's acting human alright. Plus Floyd's wonderfully-light exchange with his daughter is hardly the kind of cold, emotionless quality some amateur critics like to point at 2001.2) ""the sequences without dialogue are too long, with nothing happening. Additionally to this: the classical waltz music doesn't fit the space visuals.""I can understand this criticism, even if I never had an issue with it myself. I love those long sequences: they're enticing and mysterious, and really pull you into its world. But you either like it or you don't.Regarding the music choices: at first viewing I also felt the more traditional classical music didn't quite fit. But on the 2nd and even more so now on the 3rd watch I really appreciate the wonderful symbiotic waltz of the spacecraft with the, very much earthbound, instruments. It's symbolic and meaningful.3) ""the film doesn't make any sense, especially the final section.""Again, another criticism which I felt sympathy with after first viewing (and back then not having read the book). I recommend anyone wanting to understand the science fiction aspect of the story to read Clarke's novelisation before watching. On the other hand, Kubrick's films are well known in their individualistic interpretation of source material. You don't have to read the book if you're happy with your own metaphorical interpretation of what you saw....and, as Merlin would say, that's it.This might be my longest review...and it feels like I'm only scratching the surface with what I want to say about this monumental work. The most universally-truthful thing I can say about it is that it's not gonna be for everyone. Some of you may intensely dislike it, while some may struggle to watch it all the through. If you're one of those then it doesn't mean your taste in film is faulty, it just means 2001 isn't for you. And that's fine.For the rest of us, we can only be grateful to have it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Science Fiction That Is Not For Everyone,"""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is a science fiction masterpiece directed by Stanley Kubrick, released in 1968. The film is a visually stunning exploration of humanity's relationship with technology and our place in the universe. The film's budget was reportedly around $10.5 million, and it was shot in a variety of locations, including England, the United States, and a soundstage in Borehamwood, England.The film stars Keir Dullea as astronaut David Bowman and Gary Lockwood as astronaut Frank Poole, both of whom give solid performances. The film also features a memorable turn by HAL 9000, an artificially intelligent computer, voiced by actor Douglas Rain.The film's visual effects and art design are truly breathtaking and have stood the test of time, with Kubrick using innovative techniques such as front-projection, slit-scan photography and realistic miniature models to create a believable vision of the future. The film's use of classical music, particularly Richard Strauss's ""Also sprach Zarathustra"" adds to the film's epic and otherworldly atmosphere.It's a film that requires patience, and it is not for everyone, but for those who appreciate it, it's a visionary and thought-provoking film that still resonates today. The film was nominated for four Academy Awards and won one for Best Special Visual Effects.In summary, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is a visually stunning and thought-provoking exploration of humanity's relationship with technology and our place in the universe. With its groundbreaking special effects, memorable performances, and innovative filmmaking techniques, it is a film that continues to be celebrated and studied by film enthusiasts and critics alike.Unfortunately, I din't found it so epic and it didn't passed the time exam for my opinion.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I'd rather kill you than let you kill me,"""2001, A Space Odyssey"", is Stanley Kubrick's Masterpiece in a list of masterpieces (Dr.Strangelove, Clockwork Orange, The Shining, Full Metal Jacket, Spartacus, Eyes Wide Shut, Lolita, etc.),which combined places him in the exalted role of ""greatest filmmaker of all"". This 2001 extended journey within man's existence, and into degrees of space, still seems to stand atop everything made in film history despite 37 years passing since it's release. It travels from the beginning of man's evolution through apes, to modern day space-walkers, in the blink of an ape-man's tool. And with the help of a silver monolith, possibly planted on Earth by ancient Alien visitants to trigger intellect in future humans, a trip that takes millions of years to evolve is unleashed. The apes learn about the use of power through weapons, how they can gain property, and how to kill their fellow creatures through violence. Thus four million evolutionary years later, and not that much wiser, the intellect that was released has brought them from apes to moon-dancers. Of course the astronauts are still eating slaughtered packaged meat as they ride to investigate another monolith that has been discovered buried on the moon. Things change . . . things stay the same.Everything is brilliantly done up through the 2nd monolith's arrival, including wonderful choices and uses of music and silence, but the most interesting, calculating character in the movie is waiting to be introduced. The new monolith is pointing to Jupiter, and a human mission is sent to explore the giant planet under the supervision of Hal, an extremely intelligent computer who is put in charge of the entire expedition. While most of the spacemen are in a hibernated state, Hal interacts with the few that are awake (chrushing them at chess), as he runs the entire ship.But . . . Hal begins to make mistakes, and here's where Kubrick combines inner and outer space and elevates his movie beyond simple adventure. The astronauts realize that Hal has to be shut off, and of course Hal (who is a monster at lip reading) realizes that they will try to do just that. He begins one by one to kill the astronauts air supply, rather than be put down himself . . . just as a logical egotistical mind, that is caught making mistakes by the inner man, will try to destroy a person's body and suppress the truth rather than allow itself to be quieted. It takes a man of immense will and a calm deliberate approach to dis-engage the ego in both spaceship and in a human being, and this role goes to Keir Dullea, the astronaut who both physically and symbolically breaks down the doors blocking the essence of the ship's mission, and man's mission into the future.Once Hal is placed under control, the truth is revealed . . . and man's evolution rises into the next step and beyond . . . seemingly transcending both time and space.When this movie was released it created much confusion and didn't get the critical acclaim it receives today. It's slowly unfolded into our consciousness because it's really the story of man's entire history and of our individual personal lives and dreams rolled into one......a work of genius, that continues to stand the immense test of time in an art medium that re-invents itself continually.Hats off to you Stanley Kubrick.........a work unequaled.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Many years later...,"I feel it is necessary to evoke the conditions in which I experienced «2001: A Space Odyssey» 50 years ago in Panamá, because today a regular spectator (at least, here in my city) can only see the film on video and, if possible, in a 35mm / Cinemascope copy, projected on normal screen.In those years, going to see «2001» was an event. The Panamanian public could watch movies in 35 or 70 millimeters in cinemas with large screens. On that occasion, «2001» was released in the Metro cinema, instead of the Lux, where the Cinerama system was installed, with the curved screen for which the movie was then intended. After releasing some films with triple simultaneous projection (like «This is Cinerama», «How the West Was Won», «The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm» and several travelogues), by the late 1960s the ""Cinerama experience"" could be duplicated with a single projection in 70mm, although it was also possible to do something approximate with anamorphic 35mm copies. So M-G-M took its product to its own cinema, which also had a huge screen for 70mm projection.In 1968, it was a ""far out"" experience to see a spacecraft to the strains of Johann Strauss' «By the Beautiful Blue Danube». In part, this was one of director Stanley Kubrick's main goals: to make the audiences live an audiovisual event the way music is experienced, trying to reach the subconscious without explaining or showing much, and allowing them to draw their own conclusions. However, the reaction to the film was not positive.In fact, the criticism, in general, was lukewarm. The film demanded active subjective participation, similar as when watching an experimental film, something rarely sought after by industrial cinema. Moreover, the movie has a free and even whimsical structure, in which the spectators go through a series of audiovisual sensations, including a prologue in a documentary style, until the film tells a story that comes closest to a linear narrative, in which two astronauts confront HAL 9000, a ""flipped out"" computer. Happily, over the years the film has been re-evaluated and contextualized in the global work of Kubrick, a maverick filmmaker who faced the studio system.In the 1960s, after having creative confrontations with the star-producers of «One-Eyed Jacks» and «Spartacus» (respectively, Marlon Brando and Kirk Douglas), Kubrick promised not to do more cinema if he did not have absolute artistic control. He moved to England and began the most illustrious period of his career, with movies like «Lolita», «Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb», «A Clockwork Orange», «Barry Lyndon» and this magnus opus.Although «2001» is sometimes seen as one of the first films that gave seriousness to science fiction --which is not true, for remarkable works as «Himmelskibet», «Aelita» and «Metropolis», were made during the silent era--, or as one of the films that revolutionized visual special effects, which is true, the formal approach is further enriched by considering it as one of the products that helped define postmodernist art. It achieved this with its iconoclastic blend of past and future, classical music, op art, anthropological reflection, direct allusion to consumption (with product placement of Pan American, the main airline of its time, now extinct), display of technology, metaphysical concerns about the existence of God, and beautiful utopias as the creation of the ""new man"". This postmodern aesthetic would come to complete fruition in «Star Wars» (1977), another space odyssey that did not have Kubrick's high philosophical aims, and opted for less sophisticated and more popular myths after Joseph Campbell.Thematically, «2001» gives continuity to concerns expressed in «Dr. Strangelove», about man and his relationship with the machine, man and his destiny, his spirituality and the control of his lowest instincts. In one of the most famous ellipses in the history of cinema, the conversion of the bone that serves as a weapon to primitive men, into a spaceship, points to the fact that humanity's technological advance has gone hand in hand with the discovery of tools and weapons. The film is a testimony of the naive fascination of humanity with machineries, computers and gadgets that, due to the inappropriate use of certain sectors of the earth's population, might destroy planet Earth (and our societies) of today.Now more than ever, the warning of the film (which, as some persons have well noticed, echoes the final speech of Charles Chaplin in «The Great Dictator») is relevant: men and women need to develop a culture of peace, we have to control our destructive impulses, feel as much as we think, or perhaps ""think"" less. We need more humanity, solidarity and kindness, than skill to operate machines and ""being smart"" (or, ""being the imperial boss""). The social balance of dehumanized technology leads to violence and spiritual poverty. It is therefore no coincidence that Kubrick's next film was the controversial «A Clockwork Orange», a premonitory masterpiece that showed a future violent society without values.Kubrick stated in this regard: «As somebody said, man is the missing link between primitive apes and civilized beings (...) We are semi-civilized, capable of cooperation and affection, but needing some sort of transfiguration into a higher form of life (...) Since the means to obliterate life on Earth exists, it will take more than just careful planning and reasonable cooperation to avoid some eventual catastrophic event. The problem exists as long as the potential exists, and the problem is essentially a moral one and a spiritual one».However, «2001» does not conclude on a pessimistic tone. On the contrary, the end centers its hopes on the emergence of that new being, of that ""elevated form of existence"" that we should look for in ourselves and not in the higher intelligences that astronomers tell us that exist in the vast space. Unfortunately, the trend is of the kind in «Close Encounters of the Third Type», where hope and change is expected from the skies, not from us. In 1984, Hollywood produced «2010», a sequel without Kubrick, poetry or the original mysticism, which tried to answer questions from everything external to us.For all this, «2001: A Space Odyssey», in the select company of William Cameron Menzies' «Things to Come» (1936), Robert Wise's «The Day the Earth Stood Still» (1951) and Andrei Tarkovsky's «Solaris» (1972), continues as one of the few intelligent films that, from fables of scientific anticipation, wisely reflect on the condition of humanity and our place in the Universe.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What the hell was that?,"Visually, you can not fault this film. The directing, cinematography, set and costume design is perfect. Can absolutely see why so many directors were inspired by this film.

My 2nd favorite film of all time,"For over a year, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" has been my favorite movie ever made. It is one of the films which got me into reviewing films, and it still holds up just as much as it did on my first viewing. There are many people who say that it is one of the best movies ever made. I'd probably put it somewhere in the top 10. It has accomplished so much, and it's pretty hard for me to think of other films which could top it.This movie has a few story lines. The ""Dawn of Man"" sequence shows man-apes developing the first tool, and taking a big step forward in evolution. The next storyline shows a group of astronauts on an expedition to the moon. The third storyline shows astronauts investigating an object on Jupiter with the help of an intelligent computer named HAL. The final part of the film shows the famous Stargate sequence, and this is when the film gets really complicated.I really love ambiguity. Some of my favorite films have ambiguity. However, I feel like this film does the best job at ambiguity. What sets it apart from all the other films? The reason I say it's the best is because I feel like it has the most interpretations to it. Kubrick didn't leave any clues whatsoever in the film, and by doing so, he opened up the film to many answers. I feel like no matter how many times I watch it, there will still be more interpretations that could come out of it. I have not seen any film before which gave me the same feeling towards its ambiguous moments. Usually when films gets complicated, the transitions will impress me. However, 2001 impressed me a lot more by its visuals. The visuals of the Stargate sequence were hypnotic and impressive. It was made entirely through practical effects. It may seem easy to create it nowadays, but this film was from the 1960's. That was when computers still used magnetic tape storage. If that scene doesn't impress you, nothing will.Speaking of the visuals, they looked brilliant. In fact, more than brilliant. I already mentioned how the Stargate sequence looked really good. However, that's only the tip of the iceberg. There is hardly a single frame in this film which doesn't seem intricately designed, flawlessly composed, and superbly lit. It also has impressive framing and symmetrical compositions which makes many of its shots stick out even more. Even if the viewer gets confused by it at first, the amazing visuals will keep you coming back until you do. In my opinion, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" has the best cinematography in history. No film has ever topped it before, and this films' visuals feel untouchable. The only film which has come close to topping this one before is Terrence Malick's ""Tree of Life"". However, not even that film can top this. I have a feeling that it's going to remain at #1 for a long time.HAL was a really good villain. When you watch the movie, you have a little confidence that HAL won't be able to overpower the crew of the ship. However, when you're able to figure out what HAL's plan is, it's already too late. The lines he uses in the film are really good. Even when his life is in danger, he tries to use a normal voice to calm the astronaut down. Some portions of the film with him can be really unnerving for that reason. However, I think that the biggest reason why he works so good is that it's debatable whether he is actually evil or not. It's possible that his actions are all a part of self-defense. Because of this, the viewer would likely be unsure whether they're supposed to sympathize or despise his character. In my opinion, these kinds of villains (The Revenant for example) are the best kinds of villains. Also, let's not forget the hidden secret where if you replace every letter in ""HAL"" with the letter after it, you get IBM, an American multinational technology and consulting corporation.This films' soundtrack is brilliant. It is very iconic and it's easily recognizable today. ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" is not only iconic, but it feels very grand. Every time it's played in the film, important breakthroughs in evolution are occurring. The song perfectly lets you know that something spectacular is occurring. When you go back to try and interpret the film, the soundtrack is a good clue to figuring it out. Its also fun to listen to on your own. It never gets bland, and it always feels just as amazing as when you originally heard it in the movie. There are other songs which feel haunting. Those songs perfectly represent all of the weird parts in the film. They also work very good in the background, because they immerse you with many parts of the film. The iconic ""Stargate sequence"" is made even better by its ominous score. The soundtrack perfectly represents the movie.In conclusion, this movie is a masterpiece, and it's one of the greatest films ever. It accomplishes a lot such as handling ambiguity better than any other movie I've ever seen has, containing the best visuals out of every movie I've seen, containing one of the best villains ever, and containing one of the best soundtracks ever. Every time when I re-watch it, I feel like I pick up on a lot of new things, and it still feels fresh and original. The reason why it's my favorite film of all time is because I'd rather watch it than all other movies I've seen. A few of my favorites came close to topping it before, but none were successful, and it still sits at #1. This is Kubrick's magnum opus.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Stanley Kubrick is an Unmatched Genius Filmmaker,"Admittedly, I never heard anything about 2001: A Space Odyssey until I saw a cameo of the HAL 9000 computer in the Epic Rap Battle between Steve Jobs and Bill Gates (nicepeter and epicLLOYD). I went to the library, borrowed a copy, put the DVD inside, and thought, ""Well, this ought to be the clichéd sci-fi story.And for the next two hours, I sat in amazement as I saw the breathtaking visual accomplishment of a movie. It never failed to enthrall me and keeping me on the edge of my seat. It was, in my opinion, a highly realistic view of one envisioning the year 2001 in 1968.I finished the movie, and immediately went into IMDb for the results, and I was fairly shocked at the amount of people who disliked the movie. Most of those dislikes said something along the lines of ""Overrated"", ""boring"", and ""someone tell me what the hell this is about.""Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick never really intended the audience to understand the movie completely: ""If you understand '2001' completely, we failed. We wanted to raise far more questions than we answered.""I completely agree with him. It isn't really much of a story of dialogue (which is kept to a minimum in this movie) as it is a visual story, along the lines of ""Metropolis"" or ""A Trip to the Moon."" The purpose of cinema is to provide a visual outlet to fascinating ideas and conceptions, relying on dialogue only to convey an actual story. 2001 manages to do both without the need of much dialogue, and therefore achieves what cinema originally intended to do.That is why 2001 is my favorite movie of all time. 👍👍 10/10 (and I would rate it 11/10 if I could.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

10,"This move is absolutely, most certainly one of the greatest films of its, or any other, genre. Kubrick is not only one of the greatest directors of all time, but his entire filmography should be put into a time capsule and can never be forgotten. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a journey unlike anything I have ever seen on the screen. Kubrick is one of the few directors that can draw you in and keep you captivated from beginning to end, even with the absence of extended dialogue or plot development. Just with visuals along, 2001 is able to present a picture of the future that is both sublime and horrifying. 10 out of 10, no doubt. For my money, it doesn't get much better than 2001: A Space Oddysey....now, the sequel, 2010...that's a different story.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
2001 gives mixed feelings,"2001 is complex for me. I am a huge Kubrick fan and I like practically all of his very few movies, except for this one. I can understand why it is a great achievement. At the time of its release it was an unbelievable breakthrough in both idea and in special effects and direction. For those reasons I can understand why it is a classic. But no matter how much I want to like it and see it as a masterpiece like so many others I cant say that I do. Its not that I don't like the movie, but that I actually hate it. I understand that it is tying to go beyond entertainment and make you think and not give you some fake ending that answers all the questions it raises. Instead it is trying to be very broad and give some sort of enlightenment about humans and the universe and creation. But to me it just comes off as very boring and pretentious film making. It put me to sleep. Now, many fans of the movie would just accuse me of ignorance, but I do believe I have quite a large following of people that would have to say they were more then just dozing off now and again while watching it. If you're going to watch this movie and you want to go REALLY deep with it you might as well take the advice of the original MGM tagline that went with it. It was ""the ultimate trip"" and as me and two friends of mine discovered (along with all the original hippies that saw it repeatedly in '68 who made it the box office hit that it was) its not nearly as dry when you are taking that ""trip"" while watching it.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Before Spielberg there was Stanley,This film is proving that Stanley Kubrick has already bring the Hollywood on largest par based on the technology. I just wandering how he can erect this high tech sets in 1968 itself. Before Spielberg there was Stanley. Otherwise the screenplay is very dull and the first dialogue itself is only after 25th minute of the film. I watched this film by using headset and some of the sound portion gives me headache. It is watchable movie to encounter how intelligent is Stanley Kubrick in creating the space movie in the year that Hollywood film have no any technology improvements.,7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
the best movie ever made,"it is preposterous that this film only rates #78 on this site's top 250 movies. a more accurate poll is the critic's poll taken by sight&sound magazine, which places 2001 among the top 10 films ever made. my first viewing of 2001 was a pan and scan VHS tape and the movie blew me away. only later did i see a widescreen version and realize how much i had been missing. and then i was privileged to see this movie how it must be seen, a 70mm print on the big screen! what an experience! this bold film progresses from prehistoric times to man's exploration of space, and beyond. and when i say ""beyond"" you have NO idea what i'm talking about if you haven't seen the film. go see it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Pretty but boring,"Old movies, slow movies, and profound movies can be great. Jaws, Blade Runner, and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, for example, are all fantastic.2001, however, is an old, slow, maybe profound movie during which I found myself falling asleep.Many of the shots are pretty and the music is iconic, but everything else drags - the way you feel during the 3 minute opening of black screen is indicative of how you'll feel during the rest of the movie.I read the book first and I found it terrible, but if I hadn't read it, I don't think I would have known what was going on.

Mindblowingly ahead of it's time,"OK, so this was RELEASED in 1968, but was in production for what, 2 years at least, that gets it back to 1966 when it was concieved and executed. So, Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke were brainstorming and writing the screenplay and the book simultaneously, but the end result is truly incredible.If you have not seen it, watch it. But prepare to have to think about grand themes when you do. Is could be reasonaby called ""slow"" but the cinematography fills in the slow parts, and remember 1966-68 time frameAs far as I am aware it was the first movie to show iPad type tablets used by the astronauts, and all of the displays shown in the all of the different spacecraft were flatscreens, never done before, and all of the susequent classic sci-fi used bulbous CRT displays (Alien and Aliens come immediately to mind).The first movie to depict artificial gravity, used in a ultra realistic way, to the point where the only flase depiction of zero-g is when the guy is on his way to the moon and drinks from a straw, the liquid goes back down the tube.. And not until recently have any films tried to depict accurate zero-g in a non-stupid way (like walk through a door and magically have gravity..etc).Then there is the cinematography..
Stunning.To the point where I use screenshots for my wallpaper every now and then.The story is well known by now but was challenging when it first came out, but that just encouraged repeat visits to the cinema. Eg: it played at the University Theater (amazing huge cinemascope screen and sound by Klipsh) in Toronto for 2 full years. I think that I remember that it did similar numbers in other citys around the world as well.So if you love film, this one is right up there as a candidate for top 5 ever.Better than Lawrence of Arabia ?A lot of the stuff shown was depicted for the first time in a competant, realistic way. In 2021 we have become so used to the tech, that we forget that not long ago, there was no internet, no tablets to watch SpaceX stuff on... y'know?Wonderful movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Excellent,"i recently saw Interstellar, and since that i couldn't stop thinking about this Piece of Art.this is one of the most brilliant movies i've ever seen, maybe one of the most important movie ever made (arguably one of the best sci-fi movie ever made), Kubrick is a genius, Extraordinary filmmaker. if you live in the year this movie released, you might think he's crazy, just because this movie is already far more advance than it should be. the visualization is great with the help of classical music, it's gives you intense and it brings the seriousness. the original score is great too though. some people might find this movie boring because it's kinda slow pace movie, Especially in the first twenty minutes. for me that's art and technical at the same time, the camera work, his vision of the future is just incredible. the special effect is awesome too (for 1960's movie is a breakthrough).i agree with one of the review here says ""One has to be ready for it, or it cannot be understood."" it's a perfect description.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Yeah There's Not Much Story But Who Cares?,"2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)**** (out of 4)After discovering a mysterious object beneath the moon's surface, an astronaut heads to Jupiter with a thinking computer known as the HAL 9000.That doesn't sound like too much of a plot description but to be honest there's really not too much ""story"" here. Of course, the lack of a well-detailed story is something people use to attack the film and I agree that more of a ""story"" would probably have been good during the middle portions of the film but that doesn't take away the overall impact of the movie. I was lucky enough to see this on the big screen in 2016 and it's just amazing to see this film and think that it was made over forty-five years ago.Needless to say, this film is all Stanley Kubrick as he pretty much did everything. This brain child is without a question a masterpiece on the visual level and it's just remarkable to see how well this film has stood up over time. I consider myself a major film buffs that enjoys movies from all eras but there's no way to deny that certain classics have fault with their special effects when viewed today. There's really not a single fault in regards to the effects and I must say that this film remains the benchmark for everything dealing with outer space.We could name dozens of science fiction films that 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY influenced but I think it would be easier to say that every sci-fi film that followed owes something to this. What was so remarkable is how the special effects look 100% here and even if you try looking for something that looks fake you're not going to find it. Kubrick did a remarkable job at creating space and so much so that if you learned he actually went to space to film this stuff you'd believe it. The sets are also rather remarkable and they too look every bit as great today as when they were released.The actors in the film are also very good but they really do take a back seat to everything else. This is a visual movie with breathtaking cinematography and I've already talked about the special effects. The film also works on your ears and we've got one of the greatest music scores ever recorded as well as some of the greatest sound effects you'll ever hear. Again, hearing and seeing 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY is really an adventure and an experience all of its own.Kubrick created several great films in his career and while I don't rank this as his greatest, it's impossible to underplay its importance in history and how remarkably well it stands up decades after its release.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

An Epic that will stand the test of time,"The movie, at first glance, may seem overly monotonous and lengthy. I can see why one may think this. The first time I viewed the movie, I was certainly impressed with the visuals and message, but it all seemed a bit to dry and abstract for me.Then, I viewed it a second and third time. Each time, I become more and more amazed by the simple cynical message the film tells us about the human race, and how we shoot so high, and fall so low. The message is subtle, and the meaning behind the film has been interpreted in hundreds of ways because of the genius behind the film. This is a film you must be attentive to, you can't just idly watch it while sending emails on your laptop.Overall, the stunning non-CGI visuals, the complex message, the depth of the film, and the personal impact it has had on me is incredible. As such, this is the one film I will ever give a 10/10.

2001,"The characters in this film pursue something that seems more an attempt to satisfy an eternal mortal's compulsion than an objective in itself. The senseless interest of mystery, risking life for a simple answer. The movie reaffirms this point by introducing us to the confrontation between AI's perspective and human's perspective on the mission.They are (mankind) looking for an object that could compensate the infinite darkness that conveys the existence of conscience. Our protagonist will conclude his life the same he started it: ignorant and confused. That remark shows a lack of sense in whatever the human being aspires.Does the comprehensible plot can distract you from the art? Probably. The story of the film is perfect for that reason.Those who hate this masterpiece are the type of audience that expect answers from a movie. In 2001 there's no attempt to give a concrete message. This film acts as an statement of ambiguousness and mystery, which composes the strange essence of everything that is considered attractive to the intellect. Stanley doesn't dare to give a definitive answer to our collective question; instead he offers more questions, so you can appreciate the beauty of it.I believe this movie defies our conception of cinema. Stanley comes to remind us the real sense of this art. 2001 doesn't not entertain but amazes.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

One of the most disappointing films I have ever seen,"I had high expectations of this film - having been told that it was a cinematic masterpiece, etc.Several hours later, I feel cheated - I feel I have wasted part of my life - time that could have been more productively spent sleeping, for example.This film has some of the worst acting ever to appear on screen, and is so slow moving as to be coma inducing.  I fail to see how anyone can be impressed with this - by leaving out any semblance of plot or progress, Kubrick has left the way open for a whole bunch of people to insert their own interpretations...I presume these are the same sort of people who can stare at a blank canvas and gush effusively about how it symbolizes the bleak emptiness of existence in the 20th century and other pretentious claptrap.  Personally, I expect a bit more effort on the part of the person making the film.  If I want to reflect on deep philosophical questions, I don't need a lumbering dinosaur of a film to act as a catalyst.I give it a 1, and recommend giving it a wide berth.  Maybe it's possible to get an abridged version which would condense it down to include only the significant elements - that would be a tolerable 5 minutes or so, but in it's long form, forget it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the greatest science-fiction movies of all time,"Stanley Kubrick is a movie director that can do no wrong. His vision is far more strange and thought-provoking than any other director on this planet. When he died in 1999, the world was saddened by the news of his death. But, his films didn't died, either. He left behind some of his best work to all to see. In my opinion, he left behind a lot of questions with one particular movie that really stands out as being one of the best science-fiction movies of all time. The name of the movie is 2001: A Space Odyssey, and even after 45 years, it still holds up. The movie takes place in the futuristic year of 2001, where a space crew investigates a unknown monolith that is excavated out of the Moon. The scientists don't know who put the monolith there, or how it ended up on the Moon. But, there's more to the story than investigation. Another monolith appears during the Dawn of Man sequence, where humans in the beginning of civilization were primitive apes. Meanwhile, the space crew's computer, HAL 9000, get involves in the mission and determines to find out the answer. One of the scientists on board questions about the technology of the HAL 9000 computer. What the space crew doesn't know is that HAL 9000 has a mind of his own. He is also very deadly when discovering about the unknown monolith, and even jeopardizes the astronauts onboard. He eventually kills some of them and even locks out Dr. Dave Bowman in his pod. Dave soon gets into the spaceship and deactivate HAL 9000 and then goes a mind-trip through the star-gate. One of the greatest achievements in 2001 is the mind-blowing special effects that the movie possess. A lot of science-fiction movies are jam-packed with wall-to-wall special effects, making the story harder to follow. In 2001, those special effects don't get in the way. Instead, the special effects makes us look in awe. It's the inspiration that the movie makes for us. Kubrick's vision of the future is far from being made in 1968, but there are other elements that 2001 have that makes more unique. The relationship between HAL 9000 and Dave Bowman is significant mainly because, Kubrick sets up the relationship that can take an a effect on a human being. HAL 9000 is a computer that likes to meddle with people. He is complicated in his own ways of destruction and murder. In other words, HAL 9000 can't function accordingly. It's that story that make us think about the relationship between man and machine. The monoliths also serves a significant role as well. In my own perspective of watching 2001, I think that the monoliths serves as a part of life. The Dawn of Man sequence in 2001 and the ending are crucial points to the movie. In the beginning, man is ape in a world that is inhabited by other members that make up civilization. By the end, Bowman is near death, but he is reincarnated through the monolith that is placed in his bedroom. It follows the phrase, ""What comes around, goes around."" Kubrick's direction is also very descriptive and never fails to mislead us. He uses long shots of people inside the space station. He puts us in Bowman's perspective when he is traveling through the star-gate. If I had to say something about the star-gate sequence, I would say that the questions relies on the mysteries of science and technology itself. The point is, there may be another dimension outside outer space, one that is never been seen before. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a great movie. Not only great, but magnificent in its own way. The music sets up the movie as a space opera and moves very steady on the details and visual effects. In the past years, 2001: A Space Odyssey has been criticized as being the greatest science-fiction movies of all time. I can't agree more. It is also one of my favorites. It belongs on my top 10 favorite movies list and it fully deserves to be placed there. A feast for the eyes, ears and mind for all to see and hear, and also for all generations of movie directors. Kubrick should be proud. ★★★★ 4 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Beyond Excellence,"I'm 23 and finally got around to watching 2001 for the first time last year...I had lent it to a friend who watched it before me and returned it to me along with the complaint that it was the biggest waste of time he'd ever spent.I didn't hesitate to get it watched and see what the fuss was about and I have never disagreed with someone as much. I absolutely loved it; the cinematography, the music, the (truly) epic-ness, the nostalgic-yet-unaging feel, the tension and unease throughout parts 2 and 3, the mystery and interpretativeness, the depth and the hidden meanings. Silence is used more effectively in 2001 than in any movie I'd ever experienced, the most chilling being when Dave is awaiting HAL's response to open the pod-bay doors.

But when you watch it as a modern viewer these overly long shots appear to be a ""show off"" from Kubrick.

"Powerful film, a film about humanity","2001 is the deepest and most thought provoking film I have ever seen. I had to read a lot about its hidden meaning to truly appreciate what Kubrick was trying to show us. Kubrick relies on limited dialogue and conveys a visual experience instead. It will take the average viewer time and reflection to figure this movie out, if one can figure it out. 2001 is so ahead and transcends so much that we are used to in terms of plots, twists and so on when it comes to film.2001 is about the human experience and the spirit. It delves so deep into what we are as a species. It also shows how AI can be a hindrance to human evolution. It is only until the astronaut cuts this off that he can get closer to the next level. Kubrick shows that AI is not true human evolution, we are semi-civilised and never thought about our own progress.

I could watch ""Star Wars"" and say I saw this movie! It's the same friggin' thing. I'm not trying to be so harsh on this film, but how can anyone find this entertaining?! How?! Unless you are 150 years old, that is the only way I could understand. Geez, people. This movie is so out dated and needs to be thrown away, especially from the top 250! Why are so many bad movies on top 250?! I'm getting sick of these over hyped movies! 1/10",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The sci-fi movie by definition,"This is for me THE sci-fi movie by definition, and I support my pitch with the following facts: # the movie has the ambition to tell the story of human kind from its very remote beginning four million years ago up to its far future; a huge ambition, an almost unbearable burden, but 2001 succeeds: the movie is at the same time highly epic and iconic... # epic: the story is a fantastic journey: four million years ago, a mysterious, superior entity has come on earth to chose the best among all pre-human beings (actually an ape, Moonwatch) to transition his species into its future, i.e. mankind as we know it. Four million years later, the same mysterious entity appears again and again it comes to select the best among all men (Dave Bowman) to do what his precursor had done millions of years before, i.e. to carry his species to the next level. The final amazing journey across time and space, culminating in the birth of the new species, symbolised by the huge phoetus- egg that Bowman has turned in, is a unique filmic experience # iconic: 2001 has changed sci-fi cinema for ever, sci-fi movie have never been the same since. The cinematographic solutions that Scott and his crew have created for 2001 have set new standards for any future sci-fi movie: just think of the way of portraying spaceships, moving very slowly against the infinite background of the deep space instead of being bullet-like objects as they had been shown up to then. Other visuals have been adopted by movies like the fantastic Interstellar (which I loved a lot!): think of the spinning space station, the docking scenes, and even the key visuals of the journey across the wormhole (is this Cooper or David Bowman...?). I watched 2001 back in 1969, and I keep watching it every now and then; another amazing thing of this movie is how watchable still is nearly 50 years after its production, even more so for a sci-fi movie, most of which become obsolete",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It is time to watch this incredible film again.,"I watched this film only once in an actual movie theater, and that was in 1968. I honestly don't remember seeing as much detail as I have seen in the Blue Ray DVD version, which is available online for less that $10.00. This film has not been seen as clearly as it can be seen now, on a UHD 55"" flat screen TV, it literally is a brand new movie complete with it's extra long running time due to the opening and closing musical scores being presented during a black screen. This device allows time for the theater audience to find their seats and get acclimated to the darkness. When the film begins it is a startlingly realistic vision of the distant past. Everyone knows what this film is about but if you've seen it on VHS, regular DVD or streaming video, you just have not seen it. Every second has been restored and the detail is amazing! I can't believe how a film being edited for commercial TV can be ruined so completely but now this masterpiece of cinematography and cinematic craftsmanship can be seen as it was intended to be seen, I think far better than ever expected by Kubrick himself. It is an amazing film.Younger viewers of this film will need to know that it's theatrical release in 1968 was preceded by the release of a thick paperback novel, a screenplay of sorts, written by Arthur C. Clarke himself and was a best seller and widely available and intended to be read as a helper to understanding the plot of this film. The book is still available in used bookstores. I suggest that anyone seeing the film for the first time also read the book first. It includes photos from the film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Don't watch this If you don't like kubricks' films,"I have seen a lot people. Insult this movie. Saying it is one the most boring movie and he filmed dancing apes in the opening scenes.
To them I would just say if you didn't like it it does not make it a bad movie.
Cinema is subjective , if you like movies that are made with a lot of hardwork and best production quality , then this one is for you.
Yes it is slow in pace , but if you want to find why audience praise this movie so much and you too want to join them .
I may have a solution for you, first of all watch all of his films before this then you could watch this one. Because a lot of his trademarks are present in this film.
So in order tp enjoy this master piece you must be either a philosophy lover or stanley kubrick fan.And please don't spread bad reviews about this one, because this is one of the legendary films ever made . Not only Stanley but the whole crew has worked diligently to give us this magnum opus.
Great filmamkers like Christopher nolan , James cameron , Gaspar noé to name a few. Are inspired by this movie so if you didn't like this film it is your problem.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An accomplishment unlike any other,"2001: A Space Odyssey is without a doubt, the greatest science-fiction movie of all time. Many people who have seen the movie claim it is ""boring"" or ""too slow"", but the bottom line is- if you have a short attention span, you won't like this movie. The visual effects of this movie are truly beautiful, you could say it is the Mona Lisa of movies. The storyline was very interesting, and presented ideas and a plot that very few people can think of. The minimal dialogue is great compliment to a movie like this, every word that is spoken is important in order to understand the movie. The use of music in 2001 is genius, it feels like you are sucked right into the movie, as the film's artsy space scenes flow with the classical music it is shown with. The acting in 2001 is spectacular, especially by Keir Dullea (David Bowman). I don't think the cast could have done better job. Lastly, the ending is an absolutely mind-bending series of events that leaves you thinking of how to interpret it, a truly spectacular ending to an amazing movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Don't Waste Your Time,"If you haven't seen this movie, don't bother.  It has no redeeming entertainment value whatsoever.  There is no plot, no dialogue, no action, no deeper meaning.  Nothing.  THERE'S NOTHING THERE!!How 2001 gets such high marks is beyond me.  I'll accept the fact that it had groundbreaking special effects for the 1960's (and which are still pretty good).  I'll further accept the fact that it may have had greater significance then, being released before man had even landed on the moon. I'll even go so far as to say that it might take on a greater significance if you've read either of Clarke's books (The Sentinel or 2001), which I freely admit I have not.All that being said, I fail to see the attraction to this movie.  Even as a ""cult"" piece, it fails.  Typical of several Kubrick films, it is tedious with far too much static.  Is it really necessary to focus on the hibernation chambers for 20 seconds when five seconds would more than adequately make the point?  Or to show the probe flying through space for more than a minute when you already know it's there?  Some call this art -- I call it an effort to stretch a 30-minute Discovery Channel special into a 140-minute movie.The ending itself is totally incomprehensible, with the absolute lack of dialogue providing not even the shadow of an explanation.  There's not even enough there to be open to interpretation.  Again, not having read either book, I may be at a disadvantage.  However, translating a novel into a screenplay should at least leave some *clue* as to the conclusion, even if you want to keep the audience guessing.If there is a deeper meaning to this movie, it is overwrought by today. Maybe the point is that computers aren't perfect even though they're promoted as such.  Or that computers can take over if man gives them too much power.  Ho-Hum!  Haven't we been here before?Kubrick-philes may say I'm missing it here, but I don't owe anyone an apology or explanation.  This is a terrible movie that is worth viewing only if you like to see early generations of special effects, or if you want to see Kubrick's heavy-handed, pedantic, static filmmaking at its worst.  Take my word for it -- DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!  You'll be glad you did (or didn't)!",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Magnificent...and excruciatingly boring.,"I got this movie recently when it came out on Ultra HD Blu-ray simply because it was missing in my collection and, being a Sci-Fi fan, missing 2001 in my collection simply would not do. It is a movie that was made to rely almost entirely on the visuals. It could be said that it is a visual symphony if that makes sense. Thus it was filmed on 70 mm film and in 6 channel stereo which, at the time was a huge thing. Thanks to this it actually made some sense to transfer this movie to Ultra HD Blu-ray since the originals were really good enough even though the movie was made in 1968.I remember watching this movie as a kid and was profoundly disappointed. I thought come on, where's the adventure, not to mention any form of action? Today I can more appreciate it for what it is. A visually stunning movie. I also can more appreciate the fact that the movie is trying to be scientifically accurate instead of going all out on the fiction part. The parts where gravity, or rather the lack thereof, was portrayed, that was really high tech movie making at the time. I also noticed now, when re-watching it, that all the screens are actually flat which also was really far in the future at the time. Actually it was still pretty much in the future back in 2001.However, even today, I have to say that I find the movie excruciatingly boring. It is two and a half hour long and it moves very, very slowly. It takes 50 minutes of movie time before we actually get to the main part of the movie and get onto the Discovery for instance. No matter how great the visuals are, there's only so much boredom I can stand before it starts to get to me.In the last 30 minutes or so the movie starts to become very psychedelic. The part where Bowman is pulled into the vortex, the stargate, is going on forever and in the end it just becomes a blur of headache inducing color effects. The final parts of the movie with the three Bowmans of different ages is just weird.So,as this is a non-professional and personal take on the movie I cannot really motivate more than 3 out of 5 stars.I hadn't actually planned to review this movie. Everything has really already been said about it but I could not refrain after having read this crap at Rotten Tomatoes:""Critics Consensus: One of the most influential of all sci-fi films - and one of the most controversial - Stanley Kubrick's 2001 is a delicate, poetic meditation on the ingenuity - and folly - of mankind.""It's pretty well known that Rotten Tomatoes is the absolutely worst movie rating site around and the so called ""critics"" are useless culture elite morons with an over-inflated opinion about themselves at best and politically motivated SJW asswipes at worst but still.What the hell is controversial about it? Reality check, there's really nothing controversial about it at all. It is just a fictional story in the future. Then we have that crap ""the folly"". What bloody folly? If anything the movie shows a much better future than what we got. A future where the politicians apparently promoted advancement of science and space exploration which is the direct opposite to the money and oxygen wasters we have today.Sure, if you indulge too much in smoking funny mushrooms or are politically motivated you can probably ""interpret"" the hell out of any movie and ""find"" whatever message you want but it is still BS.Well, that was my (controversial?) take on 2001.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

An experience,"This is a movie that I heard so many good things about, I just had to watch it for myself. Was it a great masterpiece? Was it just an overrated piece of crap? Well the answer is yes and yes.First the pros:
1. The score is fantastic
2. The movie is beautifully shot
3. There is a lot of symbolism in this movie
4. I think all the characters do exactly what is required of them without ever being annoying.Now the cons:
1. Most of the scenes drag on way to long
2. I didn't really like the style of this movie it unfortunately makes me want to avoid other Stanley Kubrick movies
3. Finally the movie couldn't get me to care, if I don't care how the movie ends, something is wrongWhile I understand how some people can love this movie, I also understand how someone can hate it.

Extremely boring,"This movie, I have seen it at the theaters when it came out, and many times after. I strongly feel that critics, are falling into a ""The Emporor's New Clothes"" syndrome. Some great critic said it was good, and many others followed. To have the courage to tell the truth, and say it was slow, and boring would make them seem non intellectual. The fact is it is very slow, and boring. The fact that some have called it the BEST movie ever made, is not realistic. Anyone, who has, or can sit through this in it's full length (I have many times) is trying to see what the critics find so wonderful about it. it is not.

The greatest achievement in cinema.,"This is it: Kubrick's masterstroke. Science fiction's magnum opus and quite possibly the greatest film of all.The opening credits is a moment of perfection. Like nothing else in cinema it makes my hair stand on end and brings me close to tears. How Kubrick managed this, to birth such a powerful beginning in mere seconds, amazes me. The sun peaking over the planet's edge to the tune of Strauss' Thus Spake Zarathustra -- it practically screams ""dawn of man"" without ever saying a word.Out of this is spawned an incredible journey through mankind's evolution. Technically marvelous, every detail is accounted for and engineered for a purpose. The innovation of ""2001"" saturates the film in every frame. The silence of space, the technologies of the future, the foreseeing of man's utter reliance on machines. There is no other film with as great a scope.Before science fiction was tenable ""2001"" made it so. Before we landed on the moon Kubrick took us there.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Sorry Dad,"My father's favorite film is 2001. I was familiar with 2001 before most kids were probably potty trained.

Sure the musical score was brilliant. Sure, the symbolism was profound at times. But the film moved along like a slug on ice! For me, the film began when HAL short circuited and ended with his demise. ""Daisy, daisy..."" and ""Dave, Dave..."" are classic. Some Kubrick I love and some Kubrick I don't fancy much.

Good but overrated.,"Having read the book I understand what the end is about. However if you only saw the movie and didn't read the book I'd have to say it would be very difficult to understand the ending which really makes very little sense in the movie. Good special effects for 1968 and many memorable lines like ""Open the pod bay doors Hal."" ""I'm sorry Dave I can't do that."" Some find the movie slow and tedious even boring and it can be in parts but my main gripe is the silly ending which if you only see the movie I don't know how you're supposed to understand it if you haven't read the book where it is actually explained what is going on. I think a lot of people who rave about the movie yet haven't read the book don't know what the end means at all.

Over the TOP,"2001 Space Odyssey is one of the best movies ever filmed in movie history. Is one of the best films because it represents and staged one of the best views of cinema and space at the same time. It shows how much man is fragile to the evolution that often escapes us. The most impressive thing is that this film was filmed in 1968, by far anticipating other films made for decades.

"One of the greatest films of all time, the greatest sci-fi","I first watched 2001 in 1970, and 13 I was then. It blew me away, taking me to a time, an atmosphere, a vision that far surpassed anything I had seen or read. Batman, The Time Machine, and anything else that even vaguely related to sci-fi promptly became scrap by comparison with this ode to spacial beauty, this timeless tale of man vs machine, and this celebration of human intelligence... and its limitations.Visually stunning, musically memorable, with a great director. Stanley Kubrick, in his greatest form ever, this is a movie that I have re-watched many times, and always I find new angles and details, and renewed pleasures. It is best watched on the 70mm Cinerama screen in a proper movie house, but the DVD and Blu-Ray versions already offer considerable quality, allowing one to take in the subtlety of photographic composition, and glorious special effects, that have been imitated ad nauseum, but never equalled.It is a most intelligent film, one that leaves you thinking for days, and me in awe of how human beings managed to come up with this visual wonder.Pity the most you can give this masterpiece is 10/10!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Ahead of its time,"2001: A Space Odyssey is an ethereal experience. What it covers in its 2 and a half hour run time makes all other films pacing seem bad by comparison. It's timeless and timely whilst offering a complex journey that tells so much of its story visually in a way that really trusts the audience.Keir Dullea is the ideal protagonist for a slow burning film like this. Since the film is light on exposition and answers a lot of his performance is internalised with his Kubrick stares saying everything. Douglas Rain as HAL 9000 is so unsettling from the first words spoken. His calm tone is perfect as it turns everything he says into a threat.Stanley Kubrick's direction is so confident, completely unafraid to take its time by letting the sound announce itself well before any image appears. The film not only holds up but also looks younger than it is with visual effects that feel ahead of the time and it contains the greatest match cut in cinema.By serenading the space travel with classical music it's never felt more serene in those early moments. When the music isn't present the reliance on diegetic sound or none at all for large stretches is immensely effective in maintaining tension. The sets are staggeringly good, watching the actors move around them and the sets themselves rotate never gets old.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Kubrick's outer space masterpiece,"2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY is without a doubt the 'ultimate' space movie. Films like STAR WARS or ALIEN wouldn't exist without this, the first film to realistically portray what space travel is actually like. Yes, the film is incredibly slow, long, and extreme arty, but it's also a masterpiece and quite possibly Stanley Kubrick's greatest directorial effort.After a lengthy introduction that quite wonderfully shows off man's pre-history (and includes THAT famous jump cut), we're transported to the interior of a spaceship, where protagonist Dave (Keir Dullea) must contend with the machinations of his computer, HAL 9000. Everything that happens takes place very s-l-o-w-l-y, but this was intentional and I don't think there's any better way of getting across just how elongated being in space really is.HAL 9000 dominates the film and is my favourite computer creation in cinema; the most tragic too, I think. Dullea underacts to the best of his ability and is all the better for it, and of course Kubrick's direction is masterful, with incredible attention to detail. Yes, things get extremely psychedelic and trippy for the last half-hour's light show, but then it was the 1960s and you wouldn't expect otherwise. Great stuff indeed!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the creepiest films ever made.,"I don't think ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" should really be considered a film, but instead, it should be plain art. By ""plain"" I don't mean boring or uninspiring. I call it ""plain art"" because even to consider this genius work in the same category as other movies is risking comparison, and placing this movie beside another movie is almost unfair, because no movie has ever come close to being as unique.""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is by far the most original piece of cinema ever created. It not only represents an idea so creepy and so realistic, but also breaks barriers in movie storytelling. Everything, from a 3-part narrative to an ending that makes you think for hours, wows the audience and sends their heads flying back in shock. It's a movie that a few may find weird, disjointed and pretentious, but every good movie is criticized by the public.The movie tells the story of a major transition between apes, humans and technology. Apes evolve into humans, and humans give birth to artificial intelligence. Probably one of the most memorable scenes in cinema history, as an ape smashes bones and throws one up into the air, director Stanley Kubrick carefully crafts a flawless transition from a bone into a space ship. Kubrick then takes us through some creepy ideas about unexplainable events and technology taking over humanity. Though we see three different stories, they are all connected: the apes show the first sign of evolution into humanity as they become more aware of their surroundings and learn the nature of mystery. Then, fast-forwarding thousands of years later, we see the story of a spaceship traveling to the moon on a commercial craft, and as they arrive they are shocked to find a monolith, which then transitions into a couple of months later when a newer spaceship is traveling to Jupiter.Kubrick really shows his genius in this movie, as he both directs the movie and the special effects. For the year it was made, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" completely shocked the audience with one of the most advanced and complex effects ever seen, which wows viewers even to this day. In an age where special effects were all done by hand, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" makes many people skeptical as to how they achieved some of the scenes without computer help. Aside from the stellar special effects, the score is the most haunting and unique piece of music ever put on the big screen. It so closely fits in with the movie with some major key scenes.The movie plays like an opera. It sways the audience in an inspiring music frenzy while also focusing on a story. And as we watch this movie brought to life, we question our own faith and our own motives in terms of creating artificial intelligence and traveling to foreign planets. What if one day our own race creates a HAL 9000 (a supercomputer with the ability to think and feel)? Questions like this are very much discussed upon watching this terribly amazing movie.Stanley Kubrick's best direction and one of my top movies of all time. It makes any other movie about space travel or artificial intelligence look shameful. A perfect film and an inspiring piece of art, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" defines cinema as one of the most influential and visually stunning films of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not a popcorn movie,"The monolith has been there on Earth throughout human history. It goes all the way back to the ape-man. In the near future, they have found a monolith on the moon which is kept secret with a cover story. Then 18 months later, Dr. Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Dr. Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) are on a long deep space voyage to Jupiter on Discovery 1. HAL 9000 is the computer on board that is almost human. HAL seems to be malfunctioning. It kills Poole and the rest of the hibernating crew. Bowman pulls out HAL's memory and only then does he discover the true mission. Bowman encounters a monolith in the darkness of space near Jupiter.It's hard to talk about this movie without pointing out that this is more than the normal fun space sci-fi movie. This is definitely not Star Wars but it has qualities that transcends popcorn movies. It's confounding at times. It takes its time which bored some people. Director Stanley Kubrick obviously is saying something but it's not so simplistic that one could easily explain it. One either loves the vast nature of the movie or one hates the meandering story. Nevertheless, there is no denying the profound influence of this movie and its enduring fascination.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
what's with all the praise???,"I saw this movie for the first time yesterday and have to say I'm disappointed.  maybe for the time it was a visual breakthrough for film, and maybe it covered uncharted territory, but it's not that good.  this should have been a 45 minute movie, but Kubrick (who is overated on most of his movies) turned this into a load of crap.  like others, I found myself fast forwarding through most of the movie.  I really now can appreciate what Mel Brooks accomplished in Spaceballs.There are some positives...like when we see HAL reading the lips of dave and peter, that was pretty freaky.  the ending sequences are shot beautifully, and for sci-fi I can see how it influenced other films.But it is SO BORING TO WATCH.  if Kubrick had started the movie with a quick scene of the apes and monolith and then gone directly to the scene with the board meeting it would have made this a much better film.  it was grossly long and is not a great film overall.  there are great aspects, but not as a whole.  that is a fallacy of composition.  just because some parts are great, it doesn't make the whole thing great.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I have loved this movie since I first started loving movies, which was a product of my first starting to love life, love it with my consciousness, and how fitting that a movie about the development of consciousness in humanity would be associated for me with the development of my own consciousness. This movie is about the development of humanity's consciousness, as if humanity might be embodied in a single human, metonymy, a single part of a whole symbolizing the whole. It's really Hegelian and Darwinian. Read Hegel, the Phenomenology of Spirit, and think of how it resonates with this movie.

Voice of HAL a performance unto itself...,"US spacecraft bound for Jupiter is controlled by ""foolproof"" computer. Audiences in 1968--mostly the college students who were becoming the country's foremost film enthusiasts--were determined to believe that Stanley Kubrick's ""2001"" was a deep thinker (they came to this conclusion because it baffled and confused them--therefore it must be deep). The assemblage and presentation is remarkable, no doubt about it, but how deep the film actually goes is up for debate. Kubrick clearly has filmmaking prowess to spare, and his picture is a stunning achievement on a visual level (one can hardly comprehend how he managed to get this work on the screen without interference--and, if there was behind-the-scenes trouble, that achievement becomes even more heroic). Still, this voyage involving two astronauts battling a brilliant and power-mad computer of their own making is an abstract, psychedelic head trip, either intellectually stimulating or somnolent depending upon one's perceptions and patience. I found much of it, particularly the final act, cold and alienating. I also wasn't overly impressed with the elongated prehistoric prologue, even if the now-celebrated edit from flying bone/weapon to space station in the stars has become the stuff of legend (for the deep thinkers, this clunky-abrupt cut is Exhibit A). You cannot doubt Kubrick's mastery of the cinema (he also produced the film and co-wrote the screenplay with Arthur C. Clarke, from Clarke's uncredited story ""The Sentinel""), and yet the movie has no personality apart from HAL's dejected-spiteful-pitying voice. The terrific cinematography is by Geoffrey Unsworth, with assist from John Alcott. The voice of HAL is Douglas Rain (and it deserves legendary status). The actors--Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood--seem cast for their dullness (intentionally I presume), yet one does eventually tire of them. Kubrick also triumphed when he used classical music to punch up the visuals, putting a pop-art stamp on these legendary pieces. Four Oscar nominations with one win: Best Special Visual Effects (awarded to Kubrick). Five BAFTA nominations with three wins: Best Sound Track, Best Art Direction, and Best Cinematography (awarded to Unsworth). A follow-up, ""2010"", from Clarke's novel--but without Kubrick's participation--arrived in 1984. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I am speechless...,"Having just seen this fantastic film, I'm left puzzled, amazed, impressed and in complete and utter awe of Kubrick's cinematic genius. I had not expected anything to impress me as much as A Clockwork Orange, but I was pleasantly surprised. While I do find A Clockwork Orange to be a better film, I must say that this comes incredibly close... and what determines this might be the fact that, while I fully understood A Clockwork Orange(at least after my second viewing) I'm quite confused by this film. I don't entirely understand the ending, and a few various things throughout the film, but that doesn't lower my score. Not the slightest. Do you know why? Well, partly because Arthur C. Clarke, the co-writer of the screenplay once said: ""If you understand 2001 completely, we failed. We wanted to raise far more questions than we answered."" And partly because the very visuals of this film warrant a perfect rating of 10. I would be lying if I claimed to ever have seen such beautiful visuals as the ones throughout the film, and in particular the very end... stunning. Simply stunning. Something that I found interesting was how many times Kubrick simply used the visuals to tell the story(as opposed to dialog) and how often he simply let us enjoy the sight of the spacecrafts or the planets... instead of giving us a few unsatisfying quick cuts like a typical Hollywood director would have done. Kubrick is in no hurry to tell us this story... in fact, he wants us to relax and just be whisked away on this journey. He sets a mood like no other director has ever done, and he never breaks this mood. His use of music, while not as deliciously ironic as it is in A Clockwork Orange, is great. There are two scenes which have been referenced so many times, both content-wise and music-wise, in so many different mediums that I doubt anyone can keep track of how many parodies or references there are to them... this is, of course, the famous Dawn of Man scene, and a recurring external space scene. The plot is great. The pacing is good, considering that it's Kubrick... usually, his films are slower, but this one never really felt that slow. The characters are well-written and credible. The acting is all great. The music/score is great. The visuals of the film are amazing. I know I'm praising every aspect of the film here, but I truly think it is that good; it's one of the greatest films I've ever seen, and definitely the best visually. Finally, I'll just mention that normally I hate science fiction that deals(even slightly) with extraterrestrial activity/life and space travel. I recommend this film to any fan of high-quality science fiction and any fan of Stanley Kubrick. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Film as Art,"Certainly one of the finest films of all time.Sure, people expecting an action flick, or a simple plot, will be let down. But for a sort of contemplative experience, with the music and the film complementing each other, few compare with this masterpiece.The special effect, while perhaps not to the standards of today's computer graphics, were way ahead of their time.When I first saw this, in about 1967, I was immediately mesmerized. In 2003 I talked with a neighbor who worked at NASA. He said that if the enthusiasm that existed through the Apollo project after it's political objectives were met, we may have actually gone as far as ""2001"" predicted by that year. So, not only was it artistic. It was also prescient.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Visually spellbinding, this film remains magical.","You can only imagine what audiences first thought when they sat in cinemas back in 1968 to watch this epic masterpiece, and I would argue that this film is as profound, challenging and breaths as it was back then.If you're coming for cheap thrills and action, look away, this simply won't offer that, if you're here to experience the art of cinematic beauty and sheer imagination, you will find this film quite remarkable.I never fail to be blown away by the visuals, please compare what was in cinemas back in 68, and then take a look at this, even in 2023 I am staggered by what they created, it looks phenomenal still, in HD it is unbelievable. The visuals are the key element here, it's almost a piece of art in itself.Those opening sequences set the tone, visually appealing of course, but they are so profound and thought provoking, seeing the apes behaving as they do, I've always considered it to be a statement of man's need for power, and a propensity for violence, I'm sure there are several interpretations.So many stars here to enjoy watching, Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood are terrific, as are the likes of Leonard Rossiter and Margaret Tyzack.It's a movie you genuinely have to experience at least once. Kubrick clearly wanted to do something very different, and boy did he accomplish something special.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Weird and hard to understand, but captivating nonetheless","When I saw this movie for the first time, at the age of 14, I actually hated it: it was too slow (I had to repeatedly press the fast forward button on the remote control, especially during the last 20 minutes) and I did absolutely not get the ending. It took me two more viewings to understand that was the point: nothing ever happens quickly, man's rise to power was a slow process and therefore humanity's decline (Kubrick's favorite theme), as depicted here, should require an equally long amount of time.In fact, the director's idea is that often our greatest accomplishments are in reality an anticipation of decay. This is shown most clearly in the (very) long opening sequence, where a mysterious black monolith appears and presumably affects the planet's inhabitants (apes), as they learn to use bones as weapons, thus getting one step closer to progress but also much closer to extinction.The movie then cuts to a different era, in one of the most beautiful images of sci-fi cinema: one of the apes throws a bone in the air and as it goes back down it morphs into a spaceship. Apart from skipping centuries or even millennia in a very creative way, this also has the purpose of underlining the connection between the prologue and the rest of the film which, as indicated by the title, takes place far away from Earth in a distant (at the time this movie was made, that is) future. In particular, the focus is on a space station where a group of astronauts, led by David Bowman (Keir Dullea), are helped by a supercomputer named HAL 9000. HAL is, by his own definition, absolutely perfect and incapable of doing anything wrong. Or at least he was before the black monolith started showing up again, causing the machine to behave strangely and put the men's lives at risk (this was later reused by Kubrick, albeit differently, in Full Metal Jacket). What is happening? What is that black object, and what does it do?These questions remain unanswered, and given the director was the most notorious perfectionist in the history of cinema there has to be a good reason. Perhaps the answer is to be found in Kubrick's personal opinion about films: he believed watching movies was similar to dreaming, which is why some of his most famous works feature dream-related material (A Clockwork Orange, The Shining and the nightmarish, pun not intended, Eyes Wide Shut). In his mind, images were much more powerful than words, hence the limited dialogue in 2001: like in a dream, what really matters is what we see, not what we hear. Kubrick lets the visual elements speak by themselves, with nothing more than classical music as a companion (the ""dancing"" space vehicles and asteroids are among the most fascinating and iconic shots ever). When someone speaks, it is merely to move the plot forward, even though in one specific moment (the last scene where HAL ""appears"") it is used to highlight the film's most ironically moving sequence.Dreams are intriguing because we do not always understand their meaning and usually only remember a few images. 2001: A Space Odyssey is exactly the same: maybe the epilogue will never make sense, but the visual memories that have been left behind ensure the movie has a well deserved place in any Top 50 list of the greatest pictures of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A brilliantly made masterpiece,"Watching it after nearly half a century and it still feels as if it was released just recently except its long dialogue-less scenes. This itself makes this film one of the gem. It is definitely one of the masterpiece In Cinema, nothing more to say beyond that.
This film is not for the common audience as it has so many inter-linked layers which makes it suitable only for those who like decrypting the layers and finding out the linkages between the scenes and filling up the gaps with their our versions.
Thankfully, there are so many demystifications out there if you're not one of those creative types and the beauty of this film is that it fits into any of those decrypts, because that's how generic it is intentionally made by the creator such as to let the audiences to fill the gap as per their imaginations, which again makes this film as a very unique film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.","A half-century later, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" remains a remarkable achievement for its visionary producer / director Stanley Kubrick, who wrote the screenplay with noted author Arthur C. Clarke. Its visuals were state-of-the-art at the time, and they are still impressive all these years later. It depicts the contact that mankind has with aliens over thousands of years, beginning in the ""Dawn of Man"" when various ape-men puzzle over a strange new artifact in their world. It then makes a hard cut to the early 21st century, when space has been colonized and something amazing has been discovered beneath the surface of the moon. Then, we jump ahead again to a mission to Jupiter, commandeered by astronauts Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood). They will have their hands full, dealing with a problematic artificial intelligence named HAL (voiced by an eerily calm Douglas Rain), after which Dave is taken on a truly startling final journey.It's breathtaking to see the results of an obviously huge amount of work. Due to its widescreen photography (by Geoffrey Unsworth and John Alcott) and its sound design, this is one picture that would really rock on a big screen. Kubrick is quite daring in his approach, crafting a film that moves so slowly that it could bore people with short attention spans. But this does help in portraying a certain monotonous and empty feeling when people are working in deep space. Other elements lending ""2001"" distinction are Kubricks' use of many classic compositions, from the ""Blue Danube"" to (most memorably) ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"". The script by Kubrick and Clarke offers a stately, intelligent approach to the idea of working in outer space, complete with colourful but rather antiseptic environments. Described by some as basically a tale about evolution, and the role that these extraterrestrials played in it, it offers no easy, clear-cut answers, but instead leaves details (including the ending) open to discussion, which has kept viewers pondering it for decades. Provocative stories like this, that fire our imaginations and intellects, are often the ones with true staying power.The performances (the cast also includes William Sylvester, Daniel Richter, Leonard Rossiter, Margaret Tyzack, Robert Beatty, and Sean Sullivan) do not blow a viewer away, but are perfectly low key and do suit the material. Rain deserves a lot of credit for creating a legendary ""villain"" through just the sheer relaxed tone of his voice.Sadly, this is NOT going to suit all tastes, but audiences who favour sci-fi pictures that stress the ""science"" aspect, and attempt to appeal to adult intellects, will find it richly rewarding, no matter the run time.Originally screened at two hours and 41 minutes; later cut by about 19 minutes. The version on the Blu-ray runs two hours and 29 minutes, complete with an overture, intermission, and exit music.This delivers the kind of movie experience that discerning viewers don't easily forget.10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
So what?,"Not having seen this film until 2001; I'm compelled to enquire as to what is the big deal?  We all know Stanley Kubrick was a weird man in many ways, but this film is just decidedly average.Other than some of the visual effects which are spectacular, and the fact that it was OK in parts aboard the spaceship, the rest of it was rather boring and nothing special.The video is true to the film ... down to the point of the 10 minute blacked out section in the middle with music playing and a title in the screen saying ""Intermission""!That's taking realism a little far.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Few Random Comments,"So many  have commented, some quite scholarly.  There are few films that have been held up to such scrutiny as this one.  My reactions are emotional, although I think I could wade in the same waters as some of my predecessors. My approach to movies is to take them as they come.  I am so tired of all the talk about special effects that begin almost every review.  If you have a high profile film, the special effects are treated as if they are some a form unto themselves, as if they were actually removed from the film. Didn't like the special effects.  Didn't like the movie.  Sit down for a moment and look at this film.  It's wonderful that Kubrick was able to do what he did with those effects, but the way this movie unfolds is so  much more than that.  This movie is there to portray a sense of the awe of the universe and the future of humankind based on the increments that have led us there.  It is about a future that may occur.Everyone is talking about movie being a disappointment after reading the book.  Folks, the movie came out before the book.  The movie was originally based on a short story called ""The Sentinel"" by Arthur C. Clarke.  The movie borrows some of its thoughtfulness from ""Childhood's End,"" another Clarke book which deals with similar issues about the ends of humankind and the transmigration of our being.  If you are going to enjoy 2001, you have to put away that fixation on the conventional science fiction of the day, with foam rubber aliens and armies of extra-terrestrial implements of destruction.  Take a look at Star Wars sometime (by the way, I think it's a wonderful film).  It is really a space western, a World War II airplane movie, with a rite of passage thrown in, and the obligatory soap opera stuff with Luke and Darth Vader.  No-one can hit anything with laser weapons. Those storm troopers are the most worthless fighting force I have ever seen. It's a fun movie, but when you look at true speculative science fiction, there isn't much to think about, no metaphysics, nothing much to occupy your mind after its over.  2001 sets out to be different and shouldn't be compared to Star Wars; they are apples and oranges.  This movie has some of the most breath taking images that stand there in silent space, just getting a reaction.  If Independence Day is your thing and everything you see needs to copy it, don't bother to see this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A great, powerful, and unique cinema masterpiece","Like all works of art, great or not, however, there will be those who prefer not the qualities that make this movie great. Some say it's excruciatingly boring, and that there is just not enough plot. There are more elements to movies than explosive action and a typical, dialog-driven storyline.This movie takes some of the core elements that make movies great and expands and perfects them in a way no movie before it, to my knowledge, has never attempted or at least succeeded in doing. Because of this, it is somewhat abstract, which turns off many viewers, much in the way many people do not like abstract paintings. People want too much to know what is going on. They want the work's meaning to be force fed to them so that they don't have to go through the confusion of discovering what it means for themselves.It really is a love-it or hate-it kind of film, and is not for everyone. Personally, I love the movie, I can watch it over and over and love it more every time I do because of the beauty of every scene. The music, the camera angles, the pace, it's all perfect in my opinion, I would of not changed a thing. Kubrick portrays even the most simple of scenes with perfection, unmatched even by some of best movies these days.Never before have I seen such a powerful portrayal of space. He fills it life and death, beauty and fear, all at the same time. In any other movie, you will see space as nothing more than a place, yet Kubrich manages to make it seem as though it is living.For potential viewers, I will say this. If you are a fan of movies with action or straight forward plot and don't tend to mind if they lack heavily in terms of core cinematic elements then you probably won't like this movie very much, but if you believe in cinema as art, then you must watch this movie. You will not regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Unique Film Which Has Reached 'Classic' Status,"This has really become a classic film, not just a sci-fi classic. ""2001""was a ground-breaking event, visually-speaking, that had people talking big-time when it was released. In my college-age crowd at the time, all anyone could talk about was the famous ""light show scene"" late in the film on the trip to Jupiter.Admittedly, there are a few things that make this film less than appealing to some, and I've always found that understandable: mainly, the slowness of many scenes and the secular agenda. I've never let either one bother me. First-time viewers are warned: don't expect a fast-moving film. And don't worry about figuring out the ending. I don't know if anyone has an answer to that.The visuals - the ""light show,"" modern furniture, immense space craft, the ending bedroom scene, the apes learning to use weapons to fight each other, etc - are all fascinating aspects of this movie, but there is more. The soundtrack, the more one hears it, is extremely impressive especially as technology improves and he we hear it on a good DVD and surround system. (The Blu-Ray is fantastic.)Now that's the way to hear classical music! Strauss' ""Blue Danube"" never sounded better! Played during many of the slower parts of the film, the dramatic music enhances the feel of the immensity of space itself. Then, audibly, we hear these eerie chants whenever the mysterious monolith appears, whether its on earth, out in space, or in Jupiter. In other words, this film offers a fantastic assortment of visual and audio ""trips"" for the senses.Story-wise, it's all about HAL, the computer, and two astronauts who are under his leadership. The spacemen - played by Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood - are good, but HAL steals the show. His ""voice"" is mesmerizing, a haunting monotone. In fact, Douglas Rain is the unsung ""hero"" of this movie, with his voice-work of ""Hal."" The more one sees this movie, the more cold and evil HAL becomes.All in all, this is a movie - like the controversial ""A Clockwork Orange"" - that is so unique that I would think it would have be part of any movie fan's collection of the memorable films of the 20th century.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Painfully slow at times, fascinating and exciting at others  an intelligent sci-fi that looks great and is engaging despite having some weak aspects","A group of apes feed together as a tribe, fending off other apes. The discovery of a tall black monolith, the use of a weapon and the sending of a signal see us jump into the future where a mission is being sent to the moon. The mission is in response to the discovery of an unnatural monolith that had been deliberately buried under the surface. When the monolith emits a high pitch signal we jump 18 months forward to a mission on its way to Jupiter. Drs Bowman and Poole lead, with the rest of the crew in hibernation and the ship under the control of a HAL-9000 series computer. Things are strange enough with the mysterious nature of the mission but an apparent error in HAL creates more immediate worries.If you will humour me for a moment I will state my interpretation of the plot before looking at the film. To me the set up is about evolution of man, here being either guided or monitored by an alien race for reasons we can only wonder about. Obviously the monoliths mark times where we have advanced to a point where we can go to the next step, with Bowman's eventual journey just being the next step in man's evolution. Now what HAL's malfunction has to do with this is beyond me, in fact I'd say that it is actually unrelated but is just a separate part of the same story. However this is not a problem because both parts of the story are full of interesting ideas and strands that more than fill what is, lets be honest, a rather slow and unnecessarily long film. The pace may infuriate modern, younger viewers who have come to this as ""one of the greatest sci-fi's ever made"" expecting it to be an Aliens or a Star Wars  it isn't, it is cold, remote, slow and built on ideas more than action.The film does have several sections that could have been significantly trimmed or lost altogether and it is hard to see why some of them were there other than to fill out the running time (the bit about the rumour of ""infection"" on the moon could have been lost as we are told this much briefer in the meeting in the next scene; and the apes could have been shorter) and this is always a problem to me while those scenes are on. However, as an overall film it isn't a problem because the time does move surprisingly quickly considering how little happens at times  and it does this because it is relentlessly interesting. The evolution thread is never fully answered and, for that reason, is interesting throughout even if some viewers will baulk at the idea of being left to make their own conclusions and not having it all neatly explained for them. This makes up the beginning and end of the film, but the middle 80 minutes have little to do with it and instead are more about a view of the dangers inherent in a cold future where computers are given too much trust, credit and responsibility. Looking back, this view has only become more and more relevant and is now such a part of sci-fi that it is so easy to forget how influential this film has been. It is never fully explained why HAL goes (to quote the President in Strangelove) ""a little funny"" but it works the better for us not knowing  it feeds our mistrust of him as a computer because it could have been deliberate, accidental, pre-programmed or just his application of pure, cold logic to an situation that, because it involves humans, can never be seen in those terms. I won't ramble on, but it provides so much food for thought that it more than makes up for the very cold, stretched plot and running time.Although it is easy to pick holes in it from our CGI-enhanced world, the film still looks great and, more than that is actually imaginative  something that CGI sometimes fails to be. Again there are probably too many long scenes of craft moving silently through space but generally they are interesting. The first cut form bone to ship to the Blue Danube is iconic and will be known even to those who have never seen the film; meanwhile the silence of space is well used. The Stargate scene is well known as a ""trippy"" scene but even straight it works and (despite being overlong and slightly dated) is imaginative and interesting. The cold mood continues with the direction as Kubrick uses a lot of very static shots to tell his story  without the style and interest brought out by the movement it is WHAT he looks at rather than how and he manages to frame all manner of interesting shots within the ideas in the script. Performances are very much secondary in this cold film but Dullea is suitably restrained even if part of me wanted him to be more human in the face of HAL. Douglas Rain only provides a voice but comes out as the single most memorable ""actor"" in the film as he plays HAL with cold, logical and unmeaning menace. Outside of these two nobody else really shines as they are never the focus, although it always amuses me to see Rossiter in there! Overall this is deservedly regarded as a classic and ""must see"" film. It is not a perfect film as it is overlong, is not edited as tightly as it could have been and does sometimes focus on visuals while leaving us to work out the substance ourselves, but these are minor complaints as the film is filled with imagination both visually and idea-wise. Its status and reputation mean it is a ""must see"" for cinema fans, it is just as well then, that it is a brilliant and intelligent ""must see"" to boot.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
2001: A Space Odyssey is a miracle of cinema,"A thought-provoking exploration of the mankind's place in the universe, but most surprisingly, an incredibly entertaining and endlessly rewatchable audio-visual experience, despite its slow pace.This movie keeps my eyes glued to the screen for its whole runtime. Through the long sequence of ships moving through space, through the seemingly endless stargate sequence, even when it's literally just a black screen, I'm hooked; hypnotized, entranced. Once it's starts, there's no going back.This movie came out in 1968 and it still holds up. The effects are some of the best of all time. The sound is terrifying.

The Douglas Trumball Show...,"I cite Douglas Trumball (though he was only One of MANY) because HE has gone on to great fame because of what he did in 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY- AND because neither HIS name nor the names of any of the other visual fx technicians who worked on the movie are listed as they SHOULD be- as co-directors. (Would 2001 be the classic it is without those fx...?) Still, although it was Trumball and company who actually played the tune, it was Kubrick who conducted the orchestra. (Six of one, half dozen of the other...?) Storywise, 2001 leaves gaping holes big enough to house a million Monoliths. Why, for instance, did the aliens give Man his very first WEAPON instead of a tool that might make for a far brighter future (the wheel, say)? And was there just ONE Monolith, or THREE? Was the Monolith on Earth the same one that was later discovered on the Moon (or the one that appears at the end of the movie)? The entire Moon sequence could've been cut without adversely affecting the narrative in any way, but I must confess a fondness for The Blue Danube Waltz. Was HAL sabotaged by the aliens to somehow TEST Man's worthiness to make it to The Next Evolutionary Step? 2001 leaves a lot of questions unanswered (I saw it TWICE in theaters, hoping to pick up on details the second time around that I'd missed during my first go, but no such luck).

Better the second time around,"I had to watch 2001: for a second time after so many years. The first experience wasn't so pleasant, I didn't really appreciate this film at all to say the least. Well, it was certainly a feast of mesmerising visuals for the senses. Unfortunately, though the ensuing storyline I felt was a tad confusingespecially the symbolistic signs and direction near the end.The quality of the production was flawlessthe special effects, set designs, costumes and music was outstanding. The dialogue I felt was slow and drawn out, very frustrating after awhile.  2001: has greatness in a calm and collective wayI realise now how everyone would determine the significance of this film in their own minds, picking out what impressed them the most.My interpretation of 2001; was the beginning of creation, progressing through time and finally exploring space. The mysteries and questions are hurled at you....from all angles. At times it's difficult to comprehend, a truly thinking man's film. I hope I'm not the only one who didn't understand a few scenes??? I think a person would have to watch this film a few times to grasp further insight, it's not a film to just simply watch and forget. My lack of patience sometimes gets the better of me and for this reason I probably didn't enjoy 2001: as much as the majority.Nevertheless, I do agree it was a landmark film in it's day and still is...extremely indepth and awe inspiring, my rating - 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

By Light Years the Best Film Ever Made,"2001 warps beyond every other film ever made. I have seen it nearly a dozen times since I first saw it in 1997. I bought it right away on VHS, and when I got DVD, it was the only VHS tape I replaced with a DVD.So why is it the best film ever made? Simply because it transcends narrative. No other film has really done that. Even surrealist films are rooted in narrative. Avant-guarde films sometimes do not use narrative, but they become only moving paintings. 2001 has narrative, but it never insists on it. It lovingly displays the amazing visuals.The narrative itself makes me feel that humanity could be so much more. Kubrick usually is kind of pessimistic, but at the end of 2001, he shows Dave's transcendence. And he is moving towards Earth to bring the rest of humanity with him. Although it shows the state of humanity as it exists now as violent and unsympathetic to the plight of others, it shows hope for our future.I have a rather large complaint about how some people look at this film, though. The introductory comment to this film on this site mentions understanding it more since that person has read the novel. This is all misinformation! Kubrick was inspired by the Clarke short story ""The Sentinal,"" which I have read. It is not really worth it. If you've ever seen Clarke on The Discovery Channel's ""Mysteries of the Unknown"" or whatever it's called, you know how pompous he is. The visions in 2001 are completely Kubrick's. Arthur C. Clarke was just a trampoline off which he jumped. The novel is not an original. It was written alongside with the film, and it was published afterwards. The university at Champaigne-Urbana celebrated Hal's birth in 1996, the date it gave in the novel. It is 1992 in the film, of course. Those ungrateful losers. That is the difference between a technology nerd and a cineast. Then Clarke completely milked the greatness of this film to make a living. If you want to see how terrible he really is, see the sequel to 2001, 2010, which he wrote. It was so awful that I killed it after 20 minutes. Pay no attention to Clarke and his leech-like behavior to this masterpiece.Those complaints, of course, have nothing to do with the actual film. To me, it is the most inspirational film ever made. I would watch it over anything. infinite/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Thought provoking and beautiful,"This definitely requires more than one viewing. 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) not only boasts some of the most stunning cinematography and timeless special effects on film, but it has a story with so many layers that a revisit or two is mandatory if you even want to begin to understand it. The ending alone has been baffling people for over forty-five years. Another hundred could pass and there will still be discussions about this film.Just do yourself a favor, relax, and watch this. Don't expect lots of action or dialogue, or the sort of roller-coaster rides that science fiction movies have become. This is a film you are meant to reflect on and mull over in your mind hours afterward. It's not for everybody, but for those who are willing to go for something a bit more thoughtful, give it a whirl. The two hours and forty minutes are worth it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Always Engaging,"It was an intriguing experience, seeing this film when it first played my home city on a road show engagement.I always regretted sitting in the balcony, rather on the main floor for this 70 mm.presentation. I could only imagine the effect audiences had viewing it in true Cinerama.Kubrick made a film like none other, with a total of 88 non-dialog minutes, and exit music (of Strauss' ""Blue Danube Waltz"") that continues a good five minutes after the last credit roll.Arthur C. Clarke's comment that if one fully understands everything in the film, he would consider his contribution a failure, reminded me of Director Vincent Minnelli's answer to a question about an effect in one of his films, ""Yolanda and the Thief."" A studio exec asked him what did the mysterious ""dream apparition"" that emerged from the lake mean. Minnelli responded that he had no idea.Kubrick's choosing of the year, 2001, as a title because it represented the ""beginning of the next century"" proved less than prophetic: 2000 was the year celebrated worldwide for that event (though Kubrick was factually correct).As for actor Kier Dullea, his trademark blank-stare style seemed to work most impressively in a very limited number of other films, mainly, ""David and Lisa"" and ""The Fox."" Still, he'll be forever remembered for ""A Space Odyssey.""Ultimately, the film has won the plaudits of a majority of the public and critics. Those who either ""don't get it,"" or ""find it too slow moving"" now seem to be in the minority, and the film has ultimately won a place among the ""film greats.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Still one of the best- and certainly most unique, thought provoking science-fiction movie out there.","""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is truly a milestone in the history of filmmaking. It showed the possibilities of what you could do with the science-fiction genre, besides having aliens trying to conquer the Earth. It showed that there was a reason as to why the word science is in science-fiction. But not only just story-wise is this a great movie within its genre but also technically.It really is one of the most complex movies you'll ever see, which is however mostly simply because it leaves up a lot to your own interpretation. To me the movie has always been about the evolution of mankind. Every time the human species comes across a monolith, it marks a step forward in its evolution. But the movie never explains where the monoliths come from, or what it truly does. Does it come from space? Or perhaps it's a sign from God! It never turns into a religion versus science discussion but instead leaves everything completely open to your own interpretation. This especially goes for its ending, which director Stanley Kubrick and writer Arthur C. Clarke themselves didn't even had a real explanation for.It's actually really one of the oddest movies ever made, once you really start thinking about it. It's really not a movie with a clear, beginning, middle and end in it. Instead it could be divided into different acts, of which most of them are involving different characters. Yet everything still feels perfectly connected and in perfect harmony with each other because the movie always remains consistent with its pacing and style. The action moments are not shot and edited any faster than its mystery moments and its science-fiction elements are not any more or any less exciting than its more horror-like moments.Yes, I think ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" actually has a great horror vibe to it as well! This is all thanks to HAL 9000, who basically is one of the best horror characters of all time, even though the movie itself is of course far from a conventional horror movie. Thing that makes HAL 9000 so great and such a scary character is that he is nothing more but a red light-bulb, who is yet more and more starting to show strange human tendencies. He is so unpredictable and also incredibly powerful, since he can basically control the entire spaceship, which all makes him a quite scary and threatening character.Visually and also especially technically this is a great movie. Most of the effects in this movie were thought up and created specifically for this movie and even now days they are still great- and convincing looking. But I especially love the realistic approach of all of its science-fiction elements. It's a very detailed movie, that thought of about everything it seems. From how space-food would be like in the future, to space toilets and ways of how humans would communicated with each other and with computers.It's also really a movie that lets its images tell most of its story. The movie starts off without dialog and also the last part of the movie is completely without any dialog. Some people will be bothered by its slow pacing, while others will be fascinated by the way the movie is slowly being told and developed, without ever laying out things clearly for you. It's truly a thought provoking movie, that deserves your full attention, so just don't watch then when feeling tired or not in the mood.One of the many great and truly unique movies, from the brilliant but complicated Stanley Kubrick.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Breathtaking.,"The word ""masterpiece"" doesn't even begin to describe the stunning brilliance of this film. It is more deep, profound and complex than any other work I've ever seen. I am still completely baffled by elements of it. I have my own interpretations, as everyone does, and I can see the connections between everything but I'm sure it is far more complex than my rather simplistic interpretation. Just everything about it (the ""Dawn of Man"", HAL, beyond the infinite, the monolith, the Star Child) is absolutely mind blowing. I still can't seem to grasp my head around the perfection that I just experienced. Technically speaking, it's a marvel. The cinematography and visual effects are sensational, and it is rare to find ones superior. I wasn't bored for a second. There are a few instances where the story seems to drag a little bit, but it's necessary to further the story and explain everything that is occurring. Without these little drags, the story would be just full of holes and situations that are left unexplained. However, Kubrick recognizes this slight dullness and uses remarkable visuals, cinematography and a booming score to keep the viewer thoroughly engaged no matter what the situation. It's been over an hour and a half since I finished the film and I am still stunned, basking in it's supreme magnificence. Certainly one of the finest achievements of all time, and easily the best Kubrick I've seen so far. Exceeded any expectation I had.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Clarke (his only nomination). The Art Direction-Set Decoration was also nominated. Kubrick had previously received director and producer nominations for Dr. Strangelove (1964) and went on to earn 7 more nominations, in various categories, before his death in 1999 (two years before this film's title;-)The real star of the film is the HAL 9000 computer (AFI's #13 villain), who at first assists astronauts Bowman & Poole, before something goes wrong and ""he"" takes over the mission, with tragic results.

Complete Waste of Time,"This is easily one of the most overrated films of all time. Of the 141 minute run-time, maybe 30 minutes of that is story development; the rest is just time fillers such as watching a ship fly through space for ten minutes. I found it necessary to engage in other activities throughout the movie while these time fillers went on. This meant I was doing something else for about 90% of the time the movie was on.The music is loud, irritating, and incongruent with what is occurring. Half of it feels like happy show tunes when the visuals are either somber or nothing (i.e. a space ship flying through space for ten minutes).The ending had the feel that Kubrick was trying to do something artsy and creative...but failed miserably and created only something that was a boring culmination to a boring movie.Avoid this one at all costs...unless you want to take a 2 1/2 hour nap.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"If you can't understand it nor make sense of it, yet it's revered as a classic...by golly it must be GREAT!","Give me a break. Why is this film considered a classic?

Where does that logic come from, I wonder? I rented it 3 times, the first 2 I never got through the first 30 minutes. The 3rd time I made myself sit through it. I had to throw my shirt in the wash because of the drool stains! I mean it touches on some plot points(Alien life, the mystery of evolution...least it seems that was the idea) and them just trails off...REPEATEDLY.I cannot comment of Kubrick, I have seen several of his other films, non of which I enjoyed with the exception of ""The Shining"", which was still boring to an extent.I keep reading reviews that start out like ""Greatest movie ever made"", ""A masterpiece of cinema"". OK, I have no idea how one can come to this conclusion. But please explain what this film is about...You can't! Can you?! Any good film needs a plot, this movie is horribly lacking.I know I will get blasted for this, but if you want a movie which brings up simular type views and uses a simular style in film making, see ""Mission to Mars"". It is much more enlightening and features great actors like Gary Senise and Tim Robbins.I can't argue with the fans(sheep) of this film, because I don't know what they see in it or why. I consider myself a smart person, I like long epic style films that don't have to move at the pace of ""The Matrix"" to be good.

Dare I Say Kubrick's Best Film?,"When it comes to discussing influential movies of all time, I'd call you crazy if you did not mention 2001: A Space Odyssey. This film influenced science fiction of the future, so without this film there would be no Star Wars. This film influenced the style of future directors like Steven Spielberg and Ridley Scott, whom are fantastic filmmakers. Not only is the film influential, it's also a great movie in general. When it was first released in 1968, it was met with mixed reviews. People saw a vision that has not been seen before, and they had no idea what to think of it. I read reports of walkouts at the premiere that occurred and those who remained complained of boredom. The film is deliberately slow-paced, but my interest was held over the duration of the film. I loved the film very much, but there are so many complicated ideas. Your brain is meant to be put to use because of all these abstract ideas. I've seen the film three times already, and I'm still not sure if I fully grasped all the concepts of the film. But the bottom line is 2001 is more concerned about inspiring our awe, not thrills.One of the big reasons why we are supposed to feel a sense of awe is the music itself. You know, originally the film had an original composition by Alex North. Director Stanley Kubrick had a back up soundtrack he used to help him with the editing process. The problem is (in North's case) the music just worked too damn well with the film to not use it. He used various classical compositions such as The Blue Danube and Also sprach Zarathustra composed by Richard Strauss. The music played a huge role in the film. I feel as if it was used as the main dialogue. There is some dialogue of course, but the music tells the story and pulls the emotional strings. Kubrick's film has no dialogue the first and final twenty minutes of the film. It is all music, and the placement is right on the money.It's hard to describe what this film is actually about. There is no single plot line. Instead, the film and its themes are about the evolution of mankind. There are four main segments to the film. The first part takes place in prehistoric times. A group of apes discovered this shiny black monolith which of course is made by intelligent beings of some kind. Somehow, the monolith convinced the apes were able to discover that bones could be used as weapons. The next section takes place a few millennia later, and this is where we have the famous docking scene played to the tune of The Blue Danube. We are given a sense of realism of the docking because of the deliberately slow pace. After the docking scene, we discover a second monolith which delivers us to the next segment involving the spaceship Discovery and its intelligent mind, HAL. The ship is on a mission of some kind, although we don't glimpse many details. The final segment is the famous Stargate sequence featuring astronaut Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) as he travels through some wormhole to some unexplained space.This is one of those rare films where acting does not matter. There are not many actors present after all. Sure, I guess you could call Dullea's performance good, but he doesn't seem to matter in the film. The computer system, HAL probably shows the most emotion of anyone in the film. His voice even sounds panicked when he realizes he is about to be unplugged for good. This is one of the early films to use the theme of man versus machine. HAL believes he has good intentions, but at the sake of the astronaut's lives. He has been holding back information and later on in the minds of the astronauts, he is believed to be the bad guy.Ah, now lets talk about the spectacle of the film. The visuals are amazing, even today after all these years. We are now in the digital age, where CGI looks consistently impressive (or in some cases, not at all). But the special effects, designed with the help of Douglas Trumbull, look very convincing because the film gives off an aura of being a documentary, and the effects follows suit. They just look very real for the setting they are in. The spaceship itself looks real and I loved the docking sequence. Towards the end, where we witness the vast amount of colors and the Star Child, I was basked in a glow of delight watching the effects come to life.What I like about all of Kubricks film is that they ask us deep questions. For example, this film concerns mankind and evolution. The film asks us who we are and what is life about. Kubrick never gave in to tell us what the film is about. He opened the film up for interpretation and every idea is a plausible idea, according to Kubrick. We are just not skin and bones, but we are intelligence. We live not on planet Earth, but amongst the stars. These are just some of the ideas Kubrick was trying to convey. There are many themes to get out of the movie, being such an abstract film.This is Kubrick's most ambitious and most likely his greatest film he has ever made. I loved his previous film, Dr. Strangelove but he reaches news heights with this film. This is not a narrative story in the common sense so if you've never seen this film, just heed my warning. I love how the movie opens up for debate/interpretation and to this day, people debate about the themes and just how influential the movie is.

A True Cinematic Masterpiece by a Master Director!,"2001: A Space Odyssey is among one of the GREATEST sci-fi movies of all time and has remained a masterpiece for many decades and for so many reasons! This film has so many mind-blowing visuals, fantastic classical music, phenomenally hidden themes, masterful direction and great storytelling. Directors like Stanley Kubrick have a special place in the history of filmmaking. Kubrick is one of the VERY few directors that delivers an extremely unique presence to ALL of his films with his direction and he also knows what his audience wants out of filmmaking and I absolutely LOVE that! Even if you watch 2001 by 1st viewing and even if you don't fully understand the film, it's SOO unforgettable to step away from and it's due to unforgettable direction, plot, music and breathtakingly GORGEOUS visuals and of course the Apollo moon landing! 2001 also captures an amazing and stunning feel of mankind interfering with something that's unknown and very fascinating and we've had so many films that have portrayed 2001: A Space Odyssey and NONE of them have been able to top this film. One thing that's very interesting about Stanley Kubrick is that he will show you AMAZING and FASCINATING images in all of his films and they absolutely keep you in on edge and focused and that's because all of Kubrick's films have a feel of ""realism"" and 2001: A Space Odyssey is a perfect execution! The Shining, A Clockwork Orange, Full Metal Jacket and Dr. Strangelove along with all of Kubrick's other films have MANY things that make you follow along with their stories and messages and visuals and elements and that's what makes Stanley Kubrick a Master in cinema history! As a person who LOVES cinema and is a nerd when it comes to film, I'm gonna be completely honest when I say that ""In my mind, 2001: A Space Odyssey is the BEST directed movie I've ever seen!"" 2001: A Space Odyssey is a film that has stood the test of time HIGHLY successfully with many mind-blowing and unforgettable elements that makes this film a TRUE masterpiece! 2001: A Space Odyssey gets a 10/10!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Kubrick re-writes the cinema rulebook,"Stanley Kubrick's landmark sci-fi epic blew a lot of minds back in 1969, and at the dawn of the 21st century the film lends an even more compelling perspective to our place in the cosmos. Kubrick and co-writer Arthur C. Clarke ask more questions than they answer, which is only appropriate, since their scenario follows nothing less than he entire evolution of human consciousness, moving in daring narrative leaps across time and space from the genesis of primitive intelligence (notably, an act of violence) to Mankind's first, enigmatic encounter with infinity.And yet rarely has a film drawn on such a monumental canvas communicated so much by saying so little. Kubrick embraces a truly cosmic vision of exploration and discovery, but the ideas are expressed with an equally cosmic reticence perfectly suited to the arid emptiness of outer space (the human astronauts show even less emotion than their renegade HAL 9000 computer). Ironically, it's the void itself that leaves the deepest impression, and the film is able to capture its intimidating silence and sense of disorientation using a spare economy of images and sounds: a spacecraft racing silently over the barren, blue lunar surface; the mammoth Discovery probe en route to Jupiter, floating through the loneliest reaches of the solar system; and above all else, there's always that compelling, opaque black monolith, hovering in perfect symmetry between the sun and the stars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A short, mundane and self-absorbed story about the only Sci-Fi film ever made.","Many people talk about how many times they've seen a particular movie as evidence of it's greatness.I've seen 2001 twice.I hired it out from the video store when I was about 13 (about 6 short years ago), and it blew my mind. Sure, it was technically sophisticated, but how was it that such a great reputation was bestowed on a film that was honestly just so weird-ass and boring???No dialogue for half an hour!F***ing apes running around hitting each other, and throwing sticks in the air!A mildly interesting segment with a mean-ass pod thing that tries to eat a spaceman, and a rad bit where one jumps into outer space, closes the door and all the sound turns on was the highlight of the movie.Then more bullshit!Weird noises and whines!Ten or twenty (felt like a hundred) minutes of flashing lights! Wakes up in an old room with an old man with a glass of wine! THEN A GIANT FLOATING PLANET BABY!!!WHAT WAS THIS BULLSHIT????This film LOOKED good, but made no sense whatsoever! And when a film made no sense when I was 13, I got bored! And when a film gets boring, that usually means it's ROOTED!!!My sister watched the film at about the same time, and I distinctly remember walking in during the movie's final moments and finding her sitting upside down on her head in her chair, apparently in an attempt to prevent her natural reflexes from clicking the 'eject' button.However, I read a bit about the film (""What's this 'rebirth of man crap', and how was I supposed to think of that?"" I was thinking!) and optimistically kept a copy of the film in case it might have later value for me when I was older and wiser.As it turned out, I never watched that tape again. The years came and went, and I saw many more movies (insert nostalgic montage sequence here), read many more reviews, and the movie even came out in a new 70mm print at a few cinemas a couple of years ago. I can't remember the occasion, but the flyer (I have it blue-tacked to the roof above my bed, I collect that sort of crap) reads ""Happy Birthday Hal."", but I still couldn't bring myself to sit through it again. And eventually, I realised that I needed to see it again, simply hoping to 'get it', suspecting that if I did, I might even like it.Then a 30th anniversary video edition came out in Widescreen, which I subsequently purchased and so it came to be that I viewed '2001: A Space Odyssey' the second time.And it blew my mind again.Every thing that I'd ever read about the film was right there before me, clear as day! Everything that I loved about Kubrick (by this stage I'd seen and loved Clockwork Orange, Spartacus, Full Metal Jacket, Barry Lyndon, and to a lesser extent The Shing and Lolita) was there, mechanical characters and direction expressing extraordinary themes. It was like Kubrick concentrate! I loved every single frame of the movie, it was like he'd taken every shots and scenes that grabbed me in ways I never realised why, from every movie I'd ever seen, and thrown them together in an editing suite into 2 and a bit hours worth that just happened to privilege the most important, mind-boggling, revolutionary, ambitious and all-encompassing themes ever existent.I'd crap on about what it means, but I don't really know. I could think about it for ages, but I'd just end up at the same place again. If you want to know what it means, try reading someone else's comments here! But I don't think anybody, including Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke know totally what it means, I don't think that is possible with any movie. It reads specifically to each person who sees it, like every film or text does. And I think I should shut up soon, but not before I make a couple of points.This is probably a rash statement, and I've been searching for holes in it and haven't found any yet. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is the only true Science Fiction movie. If you take the Sci Fi from ""Star Wars"" (I film I admittedly love more, it is PERHAPS my all time favorite), you're left with what? An adventure movie, part western, part Japanese samurai film. If you take the Science Fiction out of ""2001"", you're left with nothing. ""2001"" IS science fiction.""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is by critical consensus one of the best movies ever made (I'm sure you didn't know that), and one of the top five I have ever seen. I have placed the 'Keeping 2001 tape' incident as one of the wisest things I have ever done in my life, even if I ended up taping ""Hamburger Hill"" over it.Thanks for reading!I have now just realized that the time I spent writing this overlong review could have been better spent watching the movie again.

The greatest film experience ever produced-Infinity stars out of 10!,"I saw this for the 1st time when I was 11. I liked it, but I did not fully ""love it."" Had I written this then, I would gave give this an 8. It's slow pace and little dialogue had appeal, but not enough for me to love it.I am 20 years old now, and after seeing reviews and researching it, I decided to see it again. (Look up Chris Stuckmann's review on You Tube for an example.)At a used DVD store, I got it on New Year's Eve, and than I saw it the next day. I now have a new proposal for this movie: This is the greatest film experience ever produced!The movie does not really have a ""plot"" per se, but it's rather a compilation of sequences of special effects that thread into a story about humanity, and how technology affects it over time.This creates many impressive scenes, one in which a monkey discovers how to use a bone as a tool, but then uses it as a weapon-first against other bones, and then an armadillo. Another with laser lights near the end, as well as the star child in the film's finale.I referenced Chris Stuckmann's review. In it, he mentions that the movie hypnotizes the viewer. This is absolutely true! Many scenes, like laser lights segment, put me in awe and filled me with wonder.There is very little dialogue, like I said. However, more is said with the images than whatever could be said with words. We see man evolve(I disagree with evolution but it fits with the narrative), advance in technology, the technology overcome man, and man overpower it, among many other elements.My Grandma saw a couple minutes of the movie with me, exactly 2 hours in. There was no dialogue, but a rainbow of colors flashed on the screen. She walked away to go in her room and said ""I think you wasted your money."" She said that about the American Film Institute's pick for the 22nd best movie ever made!Keep in mind that 2001 is not a movie you watch, but rather experience-and what an experience it its!Forget about 10 out of 10 stars, I give this an unlimited amount of stars.

A trip worth taking,"""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is one of the most fascinating movies I've ever seen.

It asks huge questions and let's the viewer come up with their own answer (that's a gamble; rarely does it come off just right). Different interpretations of the film's meaning abound. Unconventional is a great way to describe this.But when all is said and done, it's an adventure, as grand as they come; space travel, artificial intelligence, evolution, the unknown It's one of my favorite movies, and I'm always pleased to see it being screened at revival houses. And if you happen on one showing this in 70mm, pounce on it; the argument can be made that ""2001"" relies less on plot and more on sight and sound, which means people aren't kidding when they say this is an experience.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
2001: A Space Odyssey,2001: A Space Odyssey is a terrific film and is one of the greatest! There is so much to this film that there is to much to explain! All of the people in this film are very good. The beginning is a one of the most unique introductions ever in a film in My opinion. The Apes all looked real and the behavior and characteristics were good. The mystery that surrounds everything is fantastic. Hal is really a baddie and I just love the horror and spookiness in some scenes. The special effects are simply beautiful and is arguably the greatest and most realistic looking ever in cinema history! The music is fabulous!

Awe Inspiring Work Filled with Discoveries,"A movie fan at one of the cinematic conferences once spoke up and said that the best idea in a film is not to give any ready made answers but leave everything open to viewers' interpretations. In this case, we are all a part of art that we watch, we admire, we criticize but, foremost, discover. This assumption proves particularly suitable for Stanley Kubrick's 2001 SPACE ODYSSEY inspired by a short story by Arthur C. Clarke.What strikes viewers most about the film are the questions that the theme provokes and answers that we are likely to find in ourselves. But...nothing ready on a platter! Not much is given to us except for thrilling experience of a journey, a titled odyssey. The central theme-ODYSSEY the location-SPACESHIPS/THE UNIVERSE. In that respect, it seems inevitable to quote Roger Ebert who rightly pointed out in his review that Kubrick's genius does not lie in ""how much"" but ""how little."" Almost everything is left to us, which makes it a very difficult screen achievement and, simultaneously reflective, such ""a philosophical statement about a man's place in the universe"" (Ebert).From the first sequence titled ""Dawn of Man,"" we see apes with an obvious aspect of imprisoning our vision within a certain framework. Nevertheless, soon, we discover that these apes begin to think. A sort of Cartesius' ""Cogito Ergo Sum"" or rather an inner existence that blends with the outer reality. Something driven by some supreme power? While we begin with dawn of man, we don't end with twilight of man. Here, rather, one could quote Steven D Greyfanus who observes that the movie makes a point about our existence and consciousness which are not self explanatory. Questions arise when a black monolith appears: a challenge for the apes...some mystery which will appear more times in the movie. Is it some limitation that emerges from it? Or rather some superior reality to discover only when man drowns in it?Steven D Greyfanus interestingly claims that ""2001: A Space Odyssey doesn't just depict a quantum leap forward in human consciousness — it practically requires such a leap, on an individual scale, from the viewer."" The movie is a challenge in itself, a challenge to rise above any ready made concepts of what a movie should be like, what it should look like, what it should evoke but encounter something new, even in the genre itself. To develop this point a bit, Greyfanus goes deeper comparing this odyssey to classical Odyssey by Homer...while in the mythology, the destination is clear, it is home, in the film, it is unknown. For can any man grasp the indefinite reality of the universe and its mystery? Roger Ebert memorably notes: ""the film is not about a goal but a quest.""The characters are the heroes of this quest. Mind you that many of them, in particular Dr Heywood Floyd (William Sylvester) or Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) in the star sequence are the characters who rely solely on the intellect. In a truly unforgettable 'communication' with the on-board computer HAL 9000, there is, however, an intense desire for meaning, a quest for reasoning, search for answers. At the same time, there appears intense care not to allow any 'violation' of the mission's goals. But...at one point, man breaks a certain limit and goes too far. The realms of technology are going, the realms of human mind are going, what is left if the gravity of mind does no longer occur sufficient?The infinite that goes with Jupiter (not only the name of the planet but, for some reason deliberate or coincidental, the name of the Roman god).At that moment, we may all agree with Roger Ebert who says that it is a ""transcendent film"" and a ""silent film.""Primarily, 2001 SPACE ODYSSEY relies on visuals and music. There is not much dialog and if it appears, it is reduced to the maximum minimum, almost to a pseudo computerized interaction. There is not much 'humanity' in the language, not to say feelings. Even the 'Daisy' song or 'Happy birthday' that parents sing to their son seem to lack the basic enthusiasm and result in something artificial, robot-like. Visuals and music! The former is a unique achievement that helps us all experience the film in an unforgettable way. Seeing the movie on the big screen recently, I felt its intense effects to a grand scale. Kudos to cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth. Music, however, is an even more inspiring aspect.What a terrific choice of CLASSICAL MUSIC! Not only is it an undertone of a unique human ability, but there is another greater undertone to that. Let me quote Roger Ebert again. He observes that any music score would go with conventionalized methods of evoking action and would underline the storyline. ""The classical music,"" however, ""exists outside the action."" It is an ever present companion of man on his journey to the unknown, on his way to hear deeper, more profoundly. The waltz by Johann Strauss THE BLUE DANUBE seems to evoke a dance in the universe, outside of any gravity and within a greater power. Meanwhile, ""Thus Spoke Zarathustra"" by Richard Strauss marks the crescendo of emotions within phases of discoveries.The absolutely unpredictable finale brings everything to an uncommon conclusion, after all. You feel as if you have just started to watch this film. Time is not important but far more thought provoking is the fact that this art does not resort to pessimism of nothingness but appears to celebrate, inside us and outside us, the infinite mystery of human life.Prepare for something hard, sometimes vague and very odd, but worth enduring till the end.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Wow,"I don't know why anyone would say this is a waste of time or overhyped. Maybe they didn't get a good viewing experience because I definitely recommend watching this for the first time in theaters. This film surpassed the hype for me. I saw it with my friend a couple of days ago, he said that he didn't want to see it and he'd rather see a new movie, but, when we walked out of the theater the first thing he said to me was, ""I think that's now my favorite movie."" It was amazing, it's all I could think about for the past couple of days. There's no other movie like it. It uses the silence of space so well as awell as The Blue Danube for the elegance of space travel. See this movie in a theater ASAP!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A true film(especially sci-fi) lover's paradise.,"How do I write a review of this film without sounding pompous, arrogant or a band wagoneer hopping fan boy? I am now 41 years old in 2020 so this movie came out 12 years before I was born. Starting from approximately 18-19 I was aware of the movie and it's reputation. From the little info I'd absorbed over the years I'd pegged it as a sci-fi artsy film that movie snobs liked to analyze and praise. I had no interest, assumed it'd be boring and lack a cohesive plot. Finally about 6 years ago I gave in and watched it with extreme skepticism. I had an experience I've only had a few times. It's like being so captivated and present that there's no thought just attention, on the edge of my seat waiting to see what brilliant creative theme will appear next. I personally can't say it's at all slow, a faster pace and it wouldn't have been what it is. However, for people who have aunts in their pants or can't appreciate the building of wonder and suspense through pace it may seem that way. The second time I was able to take how far ahead of it's time this was. The number of times my mind was blown by the thought that it was made in 67 easily set a new personal record. Even if you too weren't born yet but have the ability to imagine the world then it will bring the experience to a new level. So, it turns out I am a fan boy. Not because it's the popular thing to say but because in spite of my small mind and imagined preconceptions it won me over almost immediately. It is in my opinion the greatest movie of all time. Masterpiece, legend, maverick are the appropriate descriptions. I'm still stuck in my preconceptions of Citizen Kane. How could I like a movie from 31? Hopefully I'll realize I don't know ahit and it'll also prove me wrong. Take care.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good but unnecessarily long,"There really isn't anything that I'm going to say that the other reviewers didn't already said. it's really boring, it only started to get interesting after the Intermission, and the conflict between HAL and the crew is the highlight of the movie.

2001 as the beginning of a journey,"I doubt that I will ever forget the day I first saw this film.  The year was 1989 and I was 9 years old.  I had come to the United States from Russia just two and a half months earlier and I was staying with an American cousin.  Her son happened to be a big sci-fi buff and he introduced me to the legendary Kubrick masterpiece that he owned a copy of.  I still recall the effect the film had on me.  It was chilling, mind-boggling and altogether unforgettable.  I have since seen it many times since I didn't know enough English to fully appreciate it in 1989.  But not one viewing has equaled that first one in importance, relevance and ability to inspire awe. This is the film that helped me to discover Kubrick.  This is the film that made me interested in the art of filmmaking.  And above all, this is the film that incited my love for science fiction.  The impact of 2001 was so overpowering that I was soon watching Star Trek, Star Wars and any other sci-fi material I could find.  Thus began my journey into the unknown, the mythical, the unproven and the untested.  And the catalyst for that journey was 2001: A Space Odyssey.  Now, with the recent death of its amazing director, I again look back on that day in 1989 and realize how important it was to me and how important it probably is to many others.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An unforgettable movie,"Let me start off by saying that 2001: A Space Odyssey is one of my favorite movies of all- time. It is directed, co-written, and produced by one of my favorite directors of all-time, Stanley Kubrick, who has directed other masterpieces like Dr. Strangelove, A Clockwork Orange, The Shining, and Full Metal Jacket.2001: A Space Odyssey, along with a lot of other Kubrick films, is not for everyone. It is slow paced for the most part, has very little dialogue, and has a long runtime. This movie is not for the average movie-goer.If you do decide to watch this movie, you will be treated to: fantastic visual effects, impeccable cinematography, and an interesting story.One things for sure, 2001: A Space Odyssey is a complex film. The film is frequently interpreted differently amongst people. This is especially true with the oh so famous and confusing last 30 minutes of the movie.Whether you end up liking the film or disliking it, you will not forget 2001: A Space Odyssey.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The most amazing sci-fi movie of all time,"Even in a world full of ""Independence Day""s and ""Star Wars"" flicks, the special effects of ""2001"" are still inferior to none. However, the effects of ""2001"" are not the only mind-blowing element, thanks to a top-notch director, an astounding story, and a small but wondrous lead cast.The stars in front of the cameras may seem to be Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood as the bold Jupiter astronauts, but the real stars of the show are two inanimate objects: ultra-logical computer HAL-9000 (""whom... one addresses as Hal"") and the ultra-enigmatic black monoliths scattered throughout our solar system. Stanley Kubrick rightfully favors a cerebral style over cheap mile-a-minute thrills, even though there comes a time late in the film when thrills do come around. The reason it's so good is that the thriller element never overpowers the drama, the sense of discovery, or the general legitimacy of the film's artistic capacity. Kubrick's use of classical music instead of an original score doesn't hurt, either (this is the only time I could ever actually listen to any of ""The Blue Danube"").The most awesome scene ever captured on film is the earth-shattering climactic sequence when man first meets something truly bigger than himself, a nonstop barrage of incredible sounds and colorful sights that still can't top the rest of the film in general. I don't know how else to explain it-- ""2001"" is spectacular entertainment at its best.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Words, words, words.","Over most of my life, I've studied this film and the conception of its story in both Arthur Clarke's scientific mind and in Kubrick's artistic mind, and I've learned about a great many subliminal themes and subconscious effects Kubrick wove into it. But I think that probably the most profound and unique effect of the film is this:It begins in a place before language, where a profound but inexpressible truth is communicated nonverbally, - to the Australopithecines and to the audience. It then jumps ahead to a time where language is universal and compulsory, but where it is also consistently platitudinous, shallow, (Heywood Floyd and others) deceptive, cryptic, (Hal) or purely technical in nature. Nothing of any deep truth or impact is presented in the film verbally, and most of the dialogue is distinctly mundane and, the deeper one looks into the film, duplicitous. Hal is deceiving his two astronauts, and later they are presenting a false veneer of cooperation to him. Dr. Floyd has a conversation with Russian collaborators in which all are extremely polite and friendly even as Floyd refuses to actually answer any of his companions' questions (and in which he is slyly given a middle finger by Dr. Smyslov as Smyslov moves a drink on the table).Floyd later gives a speech on the Lunar base in which he gives absolutely no actual information about the monolith, and in which are several quietly sinister references to the 'proper preparation and conditioning' of the public, the 'formal oaths' that need to be obtained and 'sacrifices' made by those privileged to be present at the meeting (Kubrick was greatly fixated on the secretive, Freemason-like enclaves of the rich and powerful). Floyd's small daughter (whose mother is currently away shopping) wants a telephone for her birthday, but he reminds her they've already got lots of telephones - so many ways to talk, but the girl still seems to desire real communication (communication and its failure is another recurring theme in Stanley's work). On and on it goes.But when we finally arrive at Jupiter and its orbiting monolith, speech drops away completely for the last twenty-three minutes of the film (about the same length as the pre-verbal prologue). Bowman passes beyond speech into the most stupefying experience in the cinema - an experience of incomprehensible images and music, (and an experience whose connection with the audience is strengthened by the fact that Bowman isn't a Specific Character, with his own personal and emotional history the movie's supplied him with, but a blank, prototypical human we can read anything onto) and even more bewilderingly, he encounters himself at the end of this journey; and the movie itself seems to pass beyond its own logic.The subconscious feeling one's left with from a full, uninterrupted viewing is of a film largely about the treachery and emptiness of speech in which we finally escape the verbal universe entirely and arrive at a place of profound but inexpressible truth; that nearly all the film before this has had a distinct falseness and superficiality about it, and we have finally found a great Secret far beyond any word. I've never seen another film that's achieved this feeling.I've studied Kubrick's other films for some time now, and 'The Shining' and 'Eyes Wide Shut' may exceed '2001' in the richness of their subliminal thematic and aesthetic tapestries (and days before he died, Stanley himself said the latter would be his greatest contribution). But none of his other movies go nearly as far down the rabbit-hole of raw experience and mystery as the Odyssey does. Emily Dickinson wrote that 'Nature is a haunted house--but Art--is a house that tries to be haunted.' Of the artists who've worked with film, Kubrick is the most skilled I've seen at haunting his houses.Einstein -'The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science. He to whom the emotion is a stranger, who can no longer pause to wonder and stand wrapped in awe, is as good as dead - his eyes are closed.'",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A sci-fi masterpiece,"I had the opportunity to see this film in IMAX for its 50th Anniversary and boy am I glad I did. The special effects hold up tremendously well and it's so easy to be absorbed into the brilliant imagery on screen. The master Stanley Kubrick makes every single frame of this film into a beautiful piece of art. HAL-9000 is chilling as one of the best villains in cinematic history. While this movie doesn't give you all the answers one is accustomed to receiving in films, this is part of what makes this film so memorable and impactful. All of science fiction owes a debt to this innovative, remarkable film. 2001: A Space Odyssey truly is one of the best science fiction films ever and one of the greatest films of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A perfect-looking masterpiece of science fiction,"This is hands down one of the most special movies I've ever seen. Despite the fact that the story is pretty good, what really makes it so outstanding comes to live in the cinematography, which is so good, there's so many beautiful shots, even in the beginning where there's no CGI. This movie looks top-notch amazing! Yhe sets are perfect, and I know it's sets, but it all looks like they're in real space ships, like they're actually in space, like they're in an actual savannah. Despite being released in 1968, this movie looks almost perfect and it's tied with another 1968 movie for the oldest movie I've ever seen, but despite all that, it looks gorgeous! The score is really great as well, the main theme is memorable andit seemed familiar and it tells us we're in for something extraordinary. I also like that they used classical music in the first half of the movie, it's so calming and the music in the second half of the movie, which I should call noises, make for a mystical vibe. The use of silence in later shots in outer space make those scenes even more gorgoes.I have some flaws with this movie though. At first I thought that the antagonist is Hal, the dictator-like arrogant computer, but then I realized it's the off-screen aliens. I don't really like the face that we have off-screen antagonists. Also, I thought that the intermission was entirely pointless. And a minor flaw is that I would've liked to spend some more time with the chimpanzees in the opening sequence.I'm a 100% certain that George Lucas and Irvin Kershner were heavily inspired by this movie. There's so many things in this movie that resemble ""A New Hope"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back"", especially visual elements, such as the outside of the ships, and I saw two or three similar shots in ""Alien"", too. Also, there's a shot on the lunar surface that resembles the shot in ""Revenge of the Sith"" right before we see Yoda medidating being interrupted by Bail Organa.If someone else made this movie it would be like an hour long without all the elongated shots, but it would lose so much, it would hardly be special anymore.I'll go watch the sequel immediately, I have sooo many questions, this movie leaves you thinking!

Mediocre,People say you just don't understand if you disagree with it being a masterpiece. That is comical. It is VERY slow at the beginning. Literally up to about the 40+ minute. Then after that it gets a little interesting. Still the pace is slow. Throw in some misdirection. Then finish with non sense even for a sci-fi movie. Some people have also praised the music and visuals. Perhaps back when it came out maybe they were great but not really nowadays. Most visuals add nothing to the movie and the music/sounds are often excessively loud. It has some interesting elements but not enough to come close to putting this in a top 1000 list.,6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the most important movies of all-time.,"2001 is a very important movie and very dear to my heart. No film can and ever will top 2001: A Space Odyssey.

If you think this is boring, you have NO CLUE what a TRUE MOVIE looks and feels like. Movies these days are complete and utter GARBAGE, but 2001 will always seem to be unbeatable. If a movie ever topped 2001's amazing stuff, that would blow my MIND.

Good for its time - Overrated,"For a movie produced in the 1960's, this is well executed cinematographically, in fact it is hard to believe it was possible. As one would expect with something from that era, the film is incredibly slow paced and there is quite significant time spent on irrelevant events.As for the story it self, it is a mixed bag. Especially the last 30 minutes could have been better. The setup is intriguing, especially in light of how humanity's own creations could become a threat to our continuation. That said, this is a reasonably good film, however, it is slightly overrated considering some of the events, the general character development and the last 30 or some minutes of the film, which could have been executed better without the need of outlandish technology.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I feel left out of the 2001 love-fest.,"I wish I could appreciate this movie as much as most film buffs seem to.  I do admire some of its imagery--the cut between the bone and the space vehicle, the star child, etc.  The use of music is very effective.  And I suppose some of the special effects were impressive at the time.  But from the standpoint of storytelling, 2001 really leaves me cold.(1) The pace, at times. . .actually the whole time. . .is excruciatingly slow.  This includes several endless minutes of ugly and gratuitous special effects that start immediately after going into the monolith near Jupiter. When people talk about the the movie's technical superiority, they never seem to mention this part.  I guess I don't mind a movie taking its time to get to a good payoff, but this crawling progression is ridiculous. Additionally, no payoff ever really comes, which leads to my next complaint.. .(2) I don't care for the way the film fails to explain itself.  I truly defy anybody to understand what the monoliths are, or what happens in the end, without having read the novel.  I read the book several years after first seeing the movie, and was filled with much more wonder by it.  If Clarke did not mind revealing what his story meant, why did Kubrick have to be so stubborn in making it all so mysterious?  It's one thing to be ambiguous or suggestive.  It's another to make no sense at all.(3) There are no characters that can be identified with.  While others say this is part of the film's genius, I heartily disagree.  The expressionless humans are actually more creepy than HAL.I met an aspiring director once who told me he thought 2001 was the best movie ever made.  When I asked him to explain why, one thing he mentioned was that it was great to watch in the 70s with a room full of people who were stoned.  Maybe I was born too late.",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It's a trap!,"Considering that this is a 1968 movie, here are my thoughts:Most ideas are way ahead of its time (9/10), but the plot makes up about one tenth of the movie (1/10).
The acting is just meh (5/10); the AI has more personality than the people (5/10).
The special effects are just amazing (10/10), but most shots are way too long even if they were/are really beautiful (6/10).
The sound effects are absolutely terrible from even before the start of the movie (1/10). Don't believe me? Watch/listen to the first 3 minutes.So, overall, I'd say this deserves a 5/10.Tip: For a better experience, unplug your headphones, set the volume to medium and be ready to abuse the '10-sec forward' button.

The film has probably inspired alot of other filmakers in one way or the other and give them ideas which have kind of made it into their films..i'm sure i heard a piece of music when the camera was panning along side the discovery 1 (which incidentally looks alot like the event horizon) ..which was on ""aliens"" when ripley was floating towards the search and rescue ship on the eev at the beginning of ""aliens"" sure it was the same music....and another thing ""skype"" this is 1968...when the agent calls his daughter..somebody at the skype offices must of seen this film to get the idea somewhere down the line..

I really tried.,"2001: A Space Odyssey is one long, boring, pointless movie.I tried. I really tried to understand the praise. I watched it 3 separate times at various points in my life, each time by myself, with no distractions (no phones, no breaks, etc). I gave it my full attention and tried to understand just what people see in this movie. I've looked up several synopses, breakdowns, interpretations online to see other people's perspectives on 2001, and what they thought it meant, or meant to them.Not a single explanation or interpretation held any weight for me. The visuals are marginal at best (even for the time), the story is about as disjointed and nonsensical as a 11 year old's diary. The music adds nothing. The monolith? The monkey-men? When a movie starts by not making any sense like 2001, you know the rest isn't going to get much better.I'm a huge scifi fan. Everything, too, not just the common fare like Star Wars. From the 50s until now, there's hundreds of great scifi films I love to watch, over and over. I love scifi because it gives you something else no other genre does. It gives you a glimpse into the future, of possible lives and worlds we'll never live to see. Something special, wonderful, sometimes horrifying, but always interesting.2001 does none of these things. It was boring nonsense when it was released in 1968, and it's boring nonsense almost 60 years later. It's a vastly overrated film. And I've held for years that for most people who claim to love 2001, who tout as an all time classic, it's because they think they're supposed to.

Let this sink in.... They have intricately detailed ship models with flashing computer screens and everything else.... But they couldn't get a background shot of a sky with moving clouds. It makes me feel really bad for the people writing 10/10 reviews, to be honest.I have no doubt this movie was ahead of its time, and there are some interesting choices, but ultimately I'm left feeling like it's a self-indulgent, slow moving, overrated movie.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The Best Movie I Never Want to See Again,"I used to think ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" was a Great Movie, but now I'm not so sure. Now that I've seen it a few times, I feel like I've gotten all there is to be gotten from it, and the thought of sitting down to watch it again triggers my brain to begin thinking of all the other things I could be doing with my time. Is that the sign of a great movie? Shouldn't we be able to revisit great movies again and again and find something fresh about them years after they initially hit the screens? I don't know.Anyway, ""2001"" is at least a terrific movie and an important one. No science fiction film made since can deny the influence of this movie's vision of space. Many of the special effects look more realistic than the computer generated effects of today. And while I defy anyone to truly explain the meaning of this film with confidence (I wonder if even Kubrick could have), it certainly makes you feel *something,* even if you're not sure what that something is.On the first viewing, the pacing of the film seemed stately and fitting for a film about drifting through the cold depths of space; now it just seems ponderous. It's even more pronounced now how little the human actors register in this film, and how HAL (which is just a voice, really) steals the show. And when I was younger and more eager to accept the opinions of film scholars and other purported know-it-alls, I thought the ending was profound and full of meaning; now it seems pretty obtuse and vague.But when it comes right down to it, Kubrick's worst movie is anyone else's masterpiece. His movies never feel comfortable with human emotions, so the fact that this movie could almost exist without humans at all comes as little surprise. His style has always been slow, but it comes as a welcome change from all the frenetic, hyper crap being produced now. And at least this movie makes you think, even if it doesn't provide any answers, which again is more than I can say for most of the movies playing in theatres this weekend.So I may not rate ""2001"" as highly as I once would have, but I fully support its place as one of the most audacious and significant films of all time.Grade: A",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Absolute masterpiece,"On a scale from 1 to 10,a ten would not be enough for such a masterwork. 1968 was the definitive landmark for sci-fi movies.So innovative was the screenplay,so devastating were the pictures,so haunting was the score that Kubrik's movie took our breath away,mesmerizing us ,turning us into creatures in rapture,in awe .Some scenes are so admirable,so sublime,that they make you cry:remember the ape discovering the power of a tool,the spaceships floating while exotic ""Blue Danube"" is heard. This movie could go on four hours and hours ,no one would notice.One hundred years from now,future scholars will write exegesises of the bewildering finale.As vain and futile as the quest for the Holy Graal.Our connection to the movie is subliminal,the long ""psychedelic"" sequence comes as a perfect metaphor.Remember ,in Ingmar Bergman's ""seventh seal"",the lines :""questions are more important than the answers"".Kubrick wanted the movie to stir something inside of us,to speak to our subconscious.And AC Clarke ,who co-wrote the screenplay mischievously added;""this is a fiction;reality will be certainly stranger"". No sci-fi movie comes close to 2001:""star wars"" does not really appeal to adults the same way ,by a long shot .""Close encounters"",while aping some of Kubrik tricks,remains puerile and spoils everything by showing almost everything in its turgid finale.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Mankind's quest for its place in the cosmos.,"2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (1968) is indisputably a landmark film in the history of cinematic special effects and in the rise to prominence of science fiction as a narrative genre in American popular culture. Released in the midst of America's initial thrust into the frontier of outer space and one year before the first moon landing, the film's special effects range from the psychedelic ""Stargate"" sequence to nearly documentary realism in the rendering of spacecraft and space travel. Several of the artists and technicians who helped create the film's special effects (especially Douglas Trumbull) were to become the gurus of SF special effects for the next several decades.Among its many distinctions, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY was the first commercially successful art film in American motion picture history. Curiously, its late '60s popular audience was instinctively more receptive to the film than the mainstream newspaper and magazine film reviewers, most of whom complained about the film's obscure plot, minimal dialog, and cardboard characters (excepting the H.A.L. 9000 computer and maybe a hominid or two). What was clear to many in the film's largely youthful and college-educated audience was that 2001's director, Stanley Kubrick, was deliberately rejecting the established Hollywood mode of storytelling and challenging his audience to a cinematic experience that was largely non-verbal yet, paradoxically, searchingly philosophical. Among a generation feverishly seeking alternatives to the established social/intellectual order, the film was hailed as a profound mind trip of perception and concepts. Astonishingly, much of 2001's visionary power remains despite the passage of forty years, seven beyond the portentous date in the film's title.Regarding the film's non-verbal communication, here are a couple of startling facts: no words are spoken until nearly 30 minutes into its 139 minute running time and a total of only 40 minutes contain dialog, much of which is either minimal or emanates from a non-human source. In place of words, Kubrick uses the ""pure cinema"" of image and sound (and silence). His distinctly original marriage of a classical score to the film's primitive landscape and futuristic space imagery is justly cited as among the film's crowning achievements. The emotional reverberation of such key compositions as Richard Strauss's ""Thus Spake Zarathustra"" (opening sequence), Johann Strauss's ""Blue Danube"" (first space scene), and Ligeti's ""Atmospheres"" (distorted voices in the ""hotel"" sequence) cannot be overstated. Nor can the prolonged silences of outer space that greet the astronauts and film audience once outside the human cocoon of the spaceship.Perhaps most importantly, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY brought to film the philosophical dimension of prose science fiction that with rare exceptions (like The Day the Earth Stood Still) had largely been ignored by Hollywood in favor of more adventurous or horrific modes. Deriving its initial concept from ""The Sentinel,"" a short story written by the renowned British science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY paved the way for science fiction's now common use as a vehicle for the serious analysis of such heavy themes as human nature and evolution, man-machine interaction and differentiation, and the possibilities/implications of extra-terrestrial intelligence. From such a bizarre assembly of objects and images as proto-human cave dwellers, recurring monoliths, mammoth spaceships, an advanced but neurotic computer, a mysterious hotel suite with invisible staff, and a star-child gazing with supra-human wisdom on the universe, Stanley Kubrick forged an endlessly fascinating and provocatively ambiguous epic of mankind's quest for its place in the cosmos. Few, if any, films have had greater or more lasting impact.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good...but not great.  More style than substance.,"Good...but not great.Not quite the classic it is made out to be. Visually stunning, yet slow-paced with a tangential, random ending.Not really an actor's movie: dialogue and emotion are limited, so not much to comment on in terms of performances.Kudos for it being ahead of its time as far as science fiction dramas go.

I just didn't get it.,"Overall it's not a bad movie. The music throughout was brilliant. I thought the story was good but it was painfully slow. I can understand why it has a such a high rating but this film isn't really for me.It says I have to fill in so many characters and there isn't much else I can say so I'll let you know what I cooked for dinner tonight.I made cottage pie. Browned off some lean minced beef and ground pork with onions, a little garlic. Added beef stock, canned beans and garden beefs. I then made a southern style gravy and added it to the meat.I mashed some potatoes which I boiled in salted water, adding butter and full fat milk to make the constitancy softer (it's easier to spread on top of the gravy.Placed the meaty gravy in an oven dish spread the creamy potato on top before sprinkling mature cheddar and mozzarella on top and a few crispy onions.Baked in the oven until a cheesy crust was formed on the top.The kids loved it.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Oh, my.","Well, I've had some time on my hands recently, as I am on Christmas break, and I decided a few movies would be a good way to waste my time. Let me make it clear now, Kubrick's 2001 was definitely a good way to *waste* that time. I wish I had read the book, because this film was such a confused and muddled mess, I hardly know where to begin.For starters, the multitudes of strange and artificially created gravity fields in the ships were so mind-bogglingly unuseful that it wasted the time Kubrick took finding ways to pull that stuff off.  The special effects are remarkable, especially for its time period, but why do the ships move so slowly? Another IMDB user (no offense) commented that the 'realistic pace' of space flight is slow and 'leisurely.' Since when? Space is pretty much just that... SPACE. There's nothing around for *light years*. To get anywhere, space ships, even the ones we use nowadays, go at tremendous speeds. If it was otherwise, no one would get anywhere!Anyway, the movie may be trying to be artistic, but it fails unless the viewer is captivated. I got so bored during this movie, I regressed to making MST3K-like comments with my stepdad. It's actually pretty entertaining that way. I honestly believe that this movie would be *much* better had I read the book. Unfortunately, Kubrick relies too heavily on our imagination or our knowledge of the book to get the points of this movie across. In my view, pretty much a long and boring movie. And don't call me a cynic or an uneducated fool. Those who do might want to try to take an objective point of view in watching the movie. One might discover the horrible truth about the emperor's clothes.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Stanley Kubrick's vision of the future!,"2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) is a breath taking look at a possible future through the eyes of Arthur C. Clarke and under the direction of Stanley Kubrick. The movie itself is more of a visual work of art than anything else. All of Kubrick's future (no pun intended) trademarks can be found in this film (cold sterile sets and the Kubrick ""stare"" to name a few). The two made an awesome team. A shame that they never worked with each other again. Imagine the possibilities.The movie follows the stages of man's evolution under the watchful of the ominous monolith. Who or what exactly the monolith is or what it represents is up to the viewer to decide. I have an opinion but I'll keep it to myself. Beginning with the dawn of man and civilization, the evolved simian and to the year 2001. Man has reached the stars but will they enjoy what they discover? From Earth to the Moon to Jupiter, man has traveled hither and yonder. But they still don't grasp the basic understanding of life in general and it's continued evolution Does the discovery of the monolith on the moon have anything to do with it? Will Dr. Heywood Floyd and his men learn the meaning of it? What about Dave Bowman and his crew that orbit Jupiter? You'll have to find out when you watch this classic science fiction flick.I enjoyed this movie ever since I was a child. I have never seen anything like this before. The visuals and the music are extremely haunting. Kubrick has made a masterpiece (only to be topped by his brilliant film Barry Lyndon). A cinematic enigma that's has so many possibilities.Followed a few years later with a direct sequel. Not as brilliant as this one but satisfactory for die hard fans of the novels.Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Stanley Kubrick Hats OFF... Brilliant Just Brilliant!!,"To create a movie of this level in 1968, he deserves special recognition. It is an great accomplishment. Arthur c Clark also deserves the credit. I have only seen 3 Kubrick movie but this one is the best for me. yes it took me more than a couple of stop-reverse- play scenes to understand the theme (as it did for interstellar, mulholland dr etc). Thought Nolan was a sci fi hero but this just changed my opinion slightly. This is the kind of movie that u should see and experience rather than read a review and skip it. i did it for couple of years until i finally saw it today. worth every minute spent on it. The BGM creates the kind of tension filled environment around you, like you are there in space. The Graphics in this was near perfect for that age, watching in 2017 didn't even cause any problems for me. If you are onto the sci-fi movies this is a must watch, no wonder Nolan was inspired by this.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
EPIC.  Decades ahead of its time.  Essential viewing.,"The only reason I give it 9 and not 10 is because of the ending. Too weird! It does lead me to believe that one or more of the production team were taking recreational drugs.But other than that, it is a wonderful rendering of what could have been and perhaps what might be. Rich in detail, stunning special effects and great sets. And all from 1968... heck, I was still in high school and, as a timeline reference, the Japanese hadn't yet brought their first 4-cylinder motorcycle to market yet.The one prediction which they had completely wrong was the operator/ownership of the shuttle - PanAm was strong in 1968 but would be long gone by 2001. And we haven't discovered any remotely controlled monoliths yet.Philosophically, the film contains several messages, but one pervades all : ""we are mere puppets of the Universe"".Don't plan on watching this movie quickly, or even once.

Essential science-fiction that took me years to properly appreciate,"I got to see 2001: A Space Odyssey as a double feature with The Shining tonight, on the big screen. It was the first time I'd ever seen a Kubrick film in a cinema, and it made for one of the best double features I've ever seen; maybe even the best. 2001: A Space Odyssey was a movie I liked, and The Shining was one I've always loved, but watching them in the ideal way made them ever better.To be more specific with 2001: A Space Odyssey, though, the last time I watched it I thought it was pretty good (some eight or nine years ago), but the first time I watched it I really disliked it. It wasn't what I was expecting, and I was maybe a little too young. I think it's also the kind of film that gets substantially better every time you revisit it.Most noticeably, the special effects in the film are still flawless. You can play ""try to spot an imperfect special effect,"" but you'll lose every time. How they did some of these things in 1968 I still don't know.What felt like four disconnected stories back when I first watched this now feel more connected, though it is a film that's intentionally split into four parts. My favourite's always been the third, admittedly. Each section has great scenes and memorable visuals, but HAL-9000 as a character just brings a whole new level to the film.It's still definitely slow, but it no longer feels boring or pointless or pretentious the way I used to feel it was (I was very wrong; I see that now). The one scene that does drag is the boardroom meeting in the film's second part. It's mostly necessary exposition, but it does go on a little while without having much to offer beyond plot info.But otherwise, this is a phenomenal science-fiction classic, and I finally understand the hype. Also cannot recommend it highly enough, if you have the chance to see it in a cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Kubrick is a confused genius,"Well, after watching this movie, several thoughts struck me, none of them very good. This movie thins down to about 30 minutes of acting and storyline. The rest of the movie is lot of artist filler. I mean, how can Kubrick get away with 15 minutes of screen-saver tunnel graphics in the middle of a movie is beyond me. This movie is interrupted by slow, drawn out scenes that serve no purpose in either aesthetic value or emphasis on a thought or idea. I found it incredibly hard to patient wait for the slow scenes to end, like the half hour of apes, the 15 minutes of watching the little pod move around in space. I just don't connect with any meaning there....

It grows on you,"I've lost count of the number of times I've seen this film. The first time I saw it I felt that it was too slow and overly long, but the more times I watch 2001, the more I enjoy it.I'm only writing this review because 2001 was shown on TCM last night and, as usual, I was unable to resist the temptation to watch it once more even though I knew I had to get up early for work the next day.I feel that 2001 is Kubrick's best work - the visual effects are incredible considering the age of the movie, the soundtrack (which is used sparingly) is fantastic, the atmosphere is unnerving (just like The Shining) and the actors deliver understated performances which help keep the film believable despite the futuristic (for 1968) setting.I believe the film has two flaws .. the first is that HAL, who is allegedly incapable of error, fails to predict that Bowman will be able to shut him down with a minimum of fuss (a few seconds burn from Discovery's engines would have left him stranded outside in the pod), and the second is that the ending isn't sufficiently explained. For a film like this the ending should be explained, if only partially, because it would help the casual viewer - anybody requiring an explanation has to resort to the book, but that's not such a bad thing.If you like your sci-fi with intelligence instead of laser guns, watch 2001.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Perfect film to me,"To me, this is the perfect film... it captures something that I haven't seen any other movie capture... awe.Usually movies involve ""standard' human emotion... anger, fear, pride, passion etc... This is the only movie that I think takes a step beyond into the sublime. Standard storytelling involves 'conflict' and 'drama'. There is some of that here for sure, but there's a transcendental/meditative quality to the film.It does not use conventional storytelling techniques... and it's a good thing it doesn't. There is enough dialogue to give a complete picture of the plot... Any more dialogue would have been extraneous.However, the film is NOT a mush of ambiguity... it tells a very clear profound story about human evolution... the economy of words gives more clarity... not less...Visually, it is perfect... amazing, a film almost 50 years old... yet stands up to any sci-fi film today.If you want to be swept up in drama and 'standard' human emotion... you won't get that here.

Kubrick and Clarke. Twice the mastery. No wonder it's perfect.,"Let me tell you about the first time I saw this film. It had been released only a few years earlier and was evidently still playing in cinemas. My father took me to see it one day. It would have been around 1971, and I was 5 years old. I don't remember much clearly, and at that age I doubt most people could, however one scene was etched into my mind. It was of course the ending, where Dave emerges from his pod into the room. Why did this scene have such an impact? Not because of its significance to a 5 year old, but because it was at the point in the film that my father told me we could go because there was nothing more to see. He then attempted to usher me from the theatre. Apparently, he explained, the ""space epic"" was over. I was unconvinced and insisted that we stay until the end (you know, when the credits role?). What I saw from that point remains with me not just due to its unique nature, but specifically because it was deemed to be not worth seeing by my father - someone who's opinion I valued and trusted. Although this time, I knew that missing this scene would have been a mistake I would regret in later life. I may have been only 5 years old, but I could tell something significant was happening here, and in a strange way, I have my father to thank for drawing attention to it!It was years before I saw the film again, all the while remembering that occurrence of years earlier where it was deemed that the ending to this film actually occurred before the final scene. Why? Upon viewing the film again as an adolescent, I realised why. It is because this is the exact point in the film is where it transcends a number of commonly held notions. It transcends the notion of a ""space movie"". It transcends the explicable. And it transcends the accepted conventions of cinema. I could see that my father was motivated by fear. The fear that my first words upon leaving the cinema would be ""What did that mean?"". A question he could not answer, or perhaps did not think it was possible to explain to a 5 year old.Go to see this film, and if you find yourself thinking it is incomprehensible (or worse, has no script, direction, theme, etc.) then force yourself to watch it to its conclusion and then watch it again until you understand. Because this film contains, in it's entirety the largest idea ever put forth in a science fiction film, if not in films of all kinds. And the idea is truly awesome.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not what I once thought,"I used to consider this a great film. Now, I think it a triumph of technology, but its just a period piece.  There are just too many flaws (like the really bad cuts in the opening sunrise sequence) to call it great. The characters are unbelievably flat, the dialogue is no better than trite and the incredible adventure being shown on the screen elicits nothing more than controlled comment from robots. These are the same generation of astronauts, remember, who managed their way through Apollo 13.  Comparing the characters offered by the screenwriters makes painfully obvious how much of a cartoon we were offered in 2001. I'm sure the film hasn't changed, but I have. But what it might look like with some modern effects and plausible character development is something we'll never enjoy. Sad.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Literally breathtaking,"If you're one who searches best movies of all time on your browser then you must have found this one on every list available on the web, Most probably you've seen it already. It would also be likely that you haven't. Well, if I may say, you've are missing out a great movie experience my friend.Deemed ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"", 2001: A Space Odyssey was selected for preservation in the National Film registry by the US Library of Congress in 1991.Considered to be his magnum opus, 2001 surely is the best film to start with if you haven't seen any Stanley Kubrick film yet.In a nutshell, it is about a US space mission lead by scientists Dr. David Bowman and Dr. Frank Poole, with three other scientists in crypto sleep, aboard the spaceship Discovery bound for Jupiter. Discovery was programmed to be operated mainly by Hal, a sentient HAL 9000 supercomputer. When Hal alerted the scientists about an antenna control devise failure, Bowman and Poole - after launching an EVA (extravehicular activity) - found nothing wrong and began suspecting Hal. This raised a great concern especially because Hal claims he is ""foolproof and incapable of error"". Afraid that this might cause mission failure, both scientists decided that if Hal is indeed malfunctioning they will disconnect him and go on manual control. When Hal found out about this plan, the mission started to go awry and everything that followed went out of plan. (Also, there are these mysterious monoliths of various sizes scattered around the outer space. What these black slabs are nobody knows but they trigger most of the action in the film.)Prior to watching the film, I have not expected anything other than it must it turning out to be a great film. I only intended to watch this film because I bought the book 2010: odyssey two by Arthur C. Clark which is the sequel of the book which this film was based on.Author Arthur C. Clark shares the credit for the conception of this film. Kubrick asked Clarke to write for him a story about space exploration and both later started thinking about the ""proverbial good science-fiction movie"". The novel 2001: A Space Odyssey was written during the years 1964-1968 and was published shortly after the release of the film in July 1968. Kubrick and Clarke later won an Oscar for the screenplay of this film.It would be no exaggeration if I say that everything about this film is remarkable considering that it was made in the late 1960's. The film explored possibilities in film that no one before 1968 has ever tried. The conceptualization to production to execution is nothing short of impressive. Even the sound design and scoring is a feat in cinematic history.
There are certain elements that fascinated me while, and even after, watching the film. Aspects of the film that are very distinct had I watched it earlier would have been the basis of my science fiction cinematic standards. These can be narrowed down into five aspects:The scoring and sound design - for about two minutes or so, I thought I'm watching a busted copy of the film because as the music progresses into a crescendo of eerie sounds that resonates horror all I'm seeing is black on the screen. In hindsight, this opening technique helped build up the tension I was about to feel throughout the film. I don't know if it was intended that way but it established the mysterious mood of film.
A minor element I like about this film is the sound the characters make when breathing. Hearing the inhale and exhale of the characters in their space suits gives the audience an immersive experience. This was a minor detail I noticed and liked in the movie Interstellar, which I thought was original having seen Interstellar first.Production design -There is something about the quality of each frame that makes if pleasing with the eyes, probably because the whole production wasn't cluttered with faux futuristic props. Even the strategic use of lighting in every scene gives off an aesthetic appeal as if every frame is a work of art. I don't know if you're supposed to feel it but everything from the costumes to props to vehicles and models and the sets are incredibly believable (for a 1968 film).Visual effects - again, this was made in the late 1960's and way before the first Star Wars film but it's unarguably still better than the latter. The seamless visual effects will make you scrutinize every scene to find lapses but it still manages to leave you wondering if they really didn't actually film it in space.
That scene where Frank Poole runs around the circular track of giant centrifuge still confuses the hell out of me. I mean, sure, they could have made it look more believable these days but in 1968? That's impressive. Also, about weightlessness effect in zero gee? I know, impressive.The camera angles and actors' movements - I haven't seen any other film by Kubrick yet to prove this impression but in 2001 Kubrick masterfully projects a sense of balance and symmetry in every frame, as well as an eye for details which can only be products of discipline. The subtle movements of the characters and the camera pacing allow you to take in everything on the screen; from the set design to the view of the outer space on the background.Less dialogue - why would you ask for more dialogue when you're already served too much on the screen? I think what Kubrick and the film in general wants to present is a possibility of what it would be like if one journeys out in space that is still a great mystery to the human mind, a visual experience - enthralling, vague, one that is beyond words.I can't stress it enough but for a film that was made in 1968, 2001: A Space Odyssey is a milestone in science fiction and deserves to be experienced. No wonder why it is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A movie you needn't bother yourself with watching.,"""2001: A Space Odyssey"", a movie heralded to be one of the greatest Science Fiction films of all time, if not the greatest.In actuality, ""2001"" is little more than a special effects bonanza with a great musical score.The movie is about...uhh.... It's about some monolith thing that lands on Earth at the dawn of mankind. And...I'm not sure what it has to do with anything. The movie eventually skips to the time of space travel, and some other strange things happen.That, right there, is the movie's biggest fault. Many fans of the movie like how ambiguous the film is, for it gives very little insight into what is happening throughout it. Now, a movie that is a bit mysterious and sometimes allows the viewer to come up with their own interpretation of what's happening is okay, but this film tells you almost nothing. You are almost completely left in the dark about everything that happens during the course of the film. I'm sorry, but, I LIKE TO HAVE AN INKLING OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN A MOVIE. If the movie expects me to come up with everything that's happening, then, why am I watching this film? I could just lay on my bed and imagine my own sci-fi adventure while playing some classical music in the background, instead, and save myself some money.There are some good points to this film. For one thing, the visual effects are fantastic (they won the movie an Academy Award, from what I've heard), and still hold up great today. The ships are intricately detailed, both inside and out. Zero-Gravity effects were also pulled off remarkably well. The special effects are a little over-the-top, sometimes, and can last for a painfully long amount of time (imagine this: A segment of the film consists of little more than an array of colors that come toward the screen in an assortment of patterns. This lasts for somewhere in the neighborhood of 5-10 minutes). Overall, the film looks great, and, since they didn't have all those fancy CG effects back in those days, you are sometimes left wondering, ""How'd they do that?"" Even the guys in the ape suits are convincing.The musical score is also very good. Enjoyable, inspiring, memorable.... You've probably heard some of these songs on TV shows and commercials many times.The characters and acting are forgettable (except, of course, when the HAL 9000 computer is concerned. Isn't it ironic? There's many human characters in this film, and the computer is the only one that really manages to instill any emotion in the viewer). They, mostly, play second fiddle to the visual effects.So, all in all, if this movie had more interesting characters in it, and something that resembled a plot, I could've truly enjoyed it. As it is, all I got from the film was a greater appreciation of the musical piece ""Blue Danube"".But...who knows? Perhaps, this film is just too high-brow for me, and my feeble mind was unable to truly grasp the greatness of this movie (although a friend of mine who watched it with me, who happens to be far more intelligent than I, didn't understand any of it either).MEGAMUR's Final Opinion: Many people consider this film to be a ""Thinking Man's Movie"". Honestly, I think it's quite the opposite. If you don't think at all during the course of the movie, and just look at the pretty pictures and listen to the nice music, and not expect anything from the plot or characters, you'll be a-okay. Otherwise, use your brain, and watch something else.That's my two cents.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
2001,"I have never seen such an amazing film since 2001: A Space Odyssey. I watched 3 times.The science fiction film directed by Stanley Kubrick in 1968. The famous science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke's film script inspired by a short story, was written by Kubrick and Clarke. The film evolution of people, technology, artificial intelligence thematic elements of work and scientific realism, pioneering visual effects, provocative ambiguity and surreal imagery contained, according to some commentators, has built its reputation with the conversation in the place of silence and minimal traditional narrative techniques.2001: A Space Odyssey, along with a lot of other Kubrick films, is not for everyone. It is slow paced for the most part, has very little dialogue, and has a long runtime.

All time favorite movie!!!,"My all time favorite movie! I've seen this movie at least 50 times, and probably will be watching it once every month until the rest of my life! I think, that this movie is exceptional on every level a movie can be. The images, the music, the story all separately work on a great level, but put them together, and they create a unique experience. At the time it was created, this was the most realistic science fiction movie. The details in every frame are incredible, I could stop the movie at any frame and use it as a picture on the wall to feast my eyes on and never get bored with it. The first time I watched this movie was with my dad when I was about 5 years old, and already then it fascinated me, although I probably understood very little about what was happening. But since the movie works on so many different levels at the same time, it caught me. And as I was getting older, I always re-watched it and seemed to gain a different experience every time. I think, this movie grows with you as you age, it inspires you to gain more knowledge about the world you live in on a scientific and a spiritual level as well.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I was blown away!,"My dad took me to see 2001 A.S.O. at a special showing in Cincinnati, Ohio. It was 1968, a full year before we landed on the moon. Needless to say, I had never experienced a movie like this one. From the opening scenes of prehistoric Africa, and Mankind's gradual evolution through the use of tools, So brilliantly presented by an animal bone tossed in the air, fading to a space shuttle, the whole Million year evolution in technology was presented. I had never seen computer graphics of schematic diagrams before (Being only 11 years at the time, I was not an M.I.T. graduate) 2001 changed everything I thought about space travel, and SF in general. When you watch it today, it does not even seem like science fiction. Everything presented has come to pass. Arthur C. Clarke was without a doubt the greatest genius of the 20th century. It took a genius director like Stanley Kubrickto bring it to life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
That's why cinema is art.,"This Stanley Kubrick masterpiece made me think over and over about us, human beings about our past, our future and our position in this universe, about our intelligence and if there's any other form of intelligence elsewhere or even a divine being.This movie shows us how humans are strong and how they are weak at the same time, in not only a Space odyssey but it's larger than this it's the odyssey of humanity, With few dialogues and speaking Kubrick made a masterpiece that remains great even after 50 years, Martin Scorsese said about Kubrick's movies that they reach some parts of your heart that you don't wanna reach, and this movie is certainly one of them!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very memorable - but puzzling and limited.,"A space mission aims to discover the meaning of transmission from the moon.How many lines have been written about this film? More importantly how many finished in question marks? Because this is a film that prefers to ask questions rather than answering them. The cinema of the imperfect, if you will.You can imagine the confusion this film must have created on release (in 1968) and it is easy to see why many didn't like it and many more stayed away. Indeed I only half like it - having actually seen it twice.Kubrick did a lot of his own cinematography and while he listened to others they rarely changed his mind. He was a film dictator, but like many great art dictators we should be grateful because other collaborators would have only left the mark of mediocrity.Do we criticise Beethoven for not collaborating with fellow composers or decry that Dylan didn't write in collaboration with a journeyman?(I would put Kubrick up with both of the above as an artist. As a man I wouldn't rate him higher than a junkyard dog.)This film may have the greatest span of time of any movie, but it is very limited. Space is a boring place says this film. Long, drawn out, nothing much of interest happens. What is interesting is man and machine - and maybe what they will find out. Although we get a lot a drum roll and very little fireworks.The classic music and the visuals are bombast that probably look fantastic on the big screen, but look a little silly on the small. To deafen and to blind are actually without skill and are little more than a carnival stunt.What I like about this film is that it fights emotions rather than plays upon it. Death matters little and the whole feel is cold and frigid. It hardly leads one to want to go in to space (as millions would like) nor put your life in the hands of machines.The sets are stunning and stand up well today, even after so much has happened to make space exploration a reality. Indeed the dwarf the humans and lead Keir Dullea is a lesson in non acting anyway.Every generation of film fan will see this film at least once, so there is nothing left for us to fight for, but I prefer films with a bit more of a story and less of feeling of self-importance based on spending vast amounts on the sets.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The film that defined science fiction cinema.,"Stanley Kubrick was a man of many talents; he knew the mysteries of the universe, and only he could show the world a visually complex tale of space travel, alien technology and only scratching the surface of the secrets in the universe. 2001: A Space Odyssey is still a masterpiece not just of science fiction, but cinema as a medium.Kubrick made a film so ahead of his time back in 1968, that it's a bit of a wonder why so few films since A Space Odyssey have reached its level of cinematic ambition and complexity. This is one of the few films to show space as a void we're only just beginning to know about, not some battlefield that breaks the rules of the vacuum on command. This is a film that spans millions of years, from the dawn of man to the film's interpretation of our future.2001 is one of those rare films that has its sense of spectacle accompanying the story, rather than being separate from the story like many $150 million+ CGI fests of today. Kubrick made this film its very own thing: a film of science fiction that was well and truly ahead of the sci-fi films of its day. It still holds up visually and narratively to this day and will for generations to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The greatest science fiction film (on planet earth),"Kubrick's allusions to zarathustrianism (zoroastrianism) in 2001: a space odyssey are apocraphic and obsessive, the special effects are decades beyond its time (they even got the surface of the moon right in 1968!), and the implications are haunting.  Kubrick's 2001 asks every question about mankind's relationship to machines, and even mankind's relationship to his predecessors.  It is as pure as the bodily fluids that fill our American bodies:  free from flouridation!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A truly amazing experience,"Kubrick is a genius and none can deny the superb special effects in this film so ahead of its time. Kubrick here achieves the promise of science fiction literature, bringing the beauty of space travel to the screen in believable form. The film opens with a prehistoric tableau: sub-human man is confronted by a huge black obelisk, an alien artifact that somehow teaches man the use of tools(and weapons). The implication is clear: man's one crucial step towards native intelligence was prompted by intelligence from the stars. Kubrick then cuts to his vision of 2001, on a space station high above Earth, and the figure of Dr Floyd who is being transferred to the moon to study a mysterious black obelisk recently discovered/excavated from beneath the Lunar surface. Our cameraman is afraid to approach this monolith as us astronauts approach and then the light of the sun hits it and a piercing signal is transmitted to the vicinity of Jupiter. Determined to investigate what lies at the other end of the signal, an expedition is mounted and eighteen months later, the great ship ""Discovery"" departs from Earth orbit. Fashioned in space, this beautiful monster carries two astronauts and three other scientists in suspended animation in the company of a smooth talking computer named HAL-9000, which seems to have developed a curious personality of its own. Hal is an adolescent in human terms, has a pathological fear of being turned off; to protect itself, the computer kills an astronaut, terminates the life functions of the three men in deep freeze and exiles another guy to slow death in a space repair pod. One man unable to reenter the ship through the normal hatches, all of which are controlled by the machine, opens a manual hatch, blows in without a space suit, and activates the airlock, penetrating the ""Discovery"" without any apparent damage(the other guy should be long dead by now) HAL is terminated after telling this guy about his mission. A third monolith is discovered on one of Jupiter's moons, and it throws the astronaut through a magnificent, most spectacular light show. At this point the remaining audience who had the patience to enjoy the film's earlier slow pace are thanking the good Lord for what they are witnessing, we have come so far. This ""light show"" kind of space travel is meant to represent or suggest some kind of mental transformation or another dimension in space or time, or both. Bowman lives out his days in plush quarters on the Jovian moons, and when he dies, is reborn again in an alien embryo, hovering over the turning green sphere of the Earth. 2001 is a major cinematic experience I discovered in my late Grandfather's video collection years ago and since then I've seen it over and over even if its a pretty long movie, its always a pleasure. After this film movie makers everywhere started taking the sci-fi genre more seriously. 2001 gave the science fiction film respectability, and a sense of growing maturity.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Still The Ultimate Trip ! . The time is now !.A landmark film with historical significance that was a revolution from the date of its premiere . Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece traces an expedition to the moon , Jupiter and beyond, and imagines the future evolution of humanity . Deeply symbolist and with many interpretations of its meaning , I am inclined towards a divine interpretation of the creation of Man, in which the supreme being grants intelligence to the human race , creating the Homo Sapiens . Kubrick's visually splendid epic is something of a space oddity and one that has confused and confounded almost everyone who has seen it . Critically acclaimed and well accepted by some , simply confusing to others . Seen by some as a mirror of human's historical use of machinery and by others as a grim vision of the future , the FX and soundtrack are still stunning . Arguments about what it all means still go on many years later the movie was released.This is the best and most famous science fiction movie in history, in which Stanley Kubrick , in the middle of the space race , wanted to show Man's relationship with the Universe . Prepared by Kubrick for four years , making an extremely meticulous shooting together with writer Arthur C Clarke , searching for the latest scientific knowledge to create a futuristic technology as close to what it could be in the immediate future , including gorgeous cinematography by Geoffrey Unsworth and ecclectic, bizarre musical score from Gayane's Adagio by Aram Khachaturyan ; Atmospheres , Lux Aeterna , Requiem , Adventures by György Ligeti ; ¨The Blue Danube"" by Johann Strauss ; Thus Spoke Zarathustra by Richard Strauss ; Off Beats Mood performed by Sidney Torch ; Daisy Bell (A Bicycle Built for Two) composed by Harry Dacre .

Game changer but boring,first i want to say that i am not perfectly bilingual so my typing is horrible i hope you will be able to read my review even with this issue1) At the time this film was release nobody has ever done anything like it. It is the father of the whole science fiction scene with is incredible images and the way Kubrick made to create these.2) That being said this is the most boring movie i have seen in my life the characters have no personality at all and the story is bland. I have not calculate it but i surely think that more than half of the movie is some image without any sound. Maybe that it's me that doesn't understand it but i don't get the purpose of it after 1 or 2 time we see the wonderful images if half of the movie is made of it this will certainly be boringTo conclude a cinema classic but deadly boring and an other time sorry for the poor English i wish i can at least be understand pleasure Max,7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Stoners in Space, sober-folk stuck on Earth","I have come to appreciate and find sci fiction movies fascinating. When I found this on Netflix i heard briefly about it. I took into consideration the time it was filmed and all (1968). For the most part this movie just wasted my evening, only about 45 minutes of this 2 and a half hour long druggie sci fiction flick. That's right druggie, when i say that my guess is that even though no one landed on the moon just yet 1968 was rolling around hippies and all, along with the Vietnam War. This movie was very slow and dull, scenes seemed to last forever, audio was repetitious, and talk was minimal and well monotone. Now I'm debating if i bother watching any other Kubrick film. I'm 18 (don't do drugs) and action i can do without sometimes, but this just bored me i'm surprised i made it to the end, i was confused so much of the time because of the little to no talk i didn't have a clue what was going on.

The most universally hailed and hated film of all time,"Let's say that you are a director. A very succesful director who has lots of clout and access to all of the best cinematic technology that money can buy. You then spend four years trying to figure out what to do with all of the expensive sets and crew that you have hired. You never figure out what to do with them and so you string together some excuse for a narrative,never clearly defining what it is you are attempting to say. The punchline to the joke is that the masses latch onto your undefined ideas and immediately take them as brilliance. It then becomes as contagious as the black plague and pretty soon everyone seems to ""know"" what the director was trying to say even though the director himself had no idea what he was saying. Multiply this by 34 years and you have a certified classic. This was the perfect marriage of eye popping visuals with a plodding, empty headed script. Kudos to Doug Trumbull's effects.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A truly landmark achievement,"Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey is one of the great examples of cinematic art. Images and sound are combined faultlessly to tell a story that is simultaneously very simple and extremely abstract. Although there are some enormous concepts at the heart of this movie, equally important is how aesthetically and aurally beautiful it all is.The film opens with the epic sound of Richard Strauss's Thus Spoke Zarathustra, which heralds the alignment of the planets in the solar system in a single unbroken line. This unique stellar occurrence signals the first interaction of the mysterious extra-terrestrial beings with the inhabitants of planet Earth. This is the Dawn of Man. The moment at which an alien hand subtly interacts with the primitive life on our planet and sets a seed that will ultimately lead them on the way to technological advancement and through that to an understanding of the universe that will prepare them for the next level of evolution. The way in which these mysterious beings kick-start this human advancement is simplicity itself. They plant a giant black rectangular monolith in their midst. This completely unnatural edifice has a curious effect on the primitive creatures who encounter it. The appearance of the razor sharp lines and perfect symmetry of the dimensions, along with the strange feeling of touching its un-naturally flat surface has an odd effect on these ape-men. It is a trigger. It is the first time these primitive minds have been forced to experience an abstract thought. The very exposure to something so alien and unnatural forces them to start viewing their world in a slightly different way, firstly leading to the use of bones as weaponry. Soon these meek creatures are the masters of their land and on their way to complete dominance of their planet.The natural result of this process is technological advancement and this leap forward is illustrated with one of the most audacious edits in film history when the first man made tool – a bone – is inter-cut with an example of a highly complex human construction: a spaceship. The point has been made that high-level human technological advancement has resulted as a direct consequence of the first encounter with the mysterious black monolith. At this point it becomes clear that Kubrick is using music very specifically. As we watch the space-transporter float through space and dock with the revolving space-station the music that soundtracks this is Johann Strauss's The Blue Danube. This beautiful, complex piece of classical music indicates aurally the advancement of man too, in terms of high artistic cultural achievement. This is in direct contrast to the avant-garde music that plays whenever the alien presence is felt. This mysterious experimental wall of sound perfectly invokes an alien intelligence. It builds up to a crescendo every time the monolith appears; climaxing unforgettably in the trip through the star-gate. This music simply represents alien interaction.It has to be said at this point too that the design work used for both the exterior and interior of the spacecrafts in 2001 is exemplary and frankly has not aged in the 40 years plus since the film's initial release; a remarkable fact considering the advances in special effects. There is something still undeniably beautiful and fantastic about how the hardware is presented in this film. This leads on to another of the key themes – what happens when man-made technology becomes so advanced that it starts to develop its own consciousness. When HAL decides to take over the mission to Jupiter in an icily cold and deadly way, this question is posed directly. And the answer is that mankind has to be very careful with technology, as the results could be deadly. In the same way as Man is shaped by the aliens, HAL is created by Man, and, similarly, it has a propensity to murder if the situation requires it.After the man vs. technology segment the film enters its final act. This is the famous star gate sequence where the final surviving astronaut, Dave Bowman, arrives at Jupiter just at the moment that the planets align once again in a straight line. A third black monolith satellite then opens the star gate and Bowman travels through in a visually spectacular sequence. Via this trip Bowman gains an acute understanding of the formation of the universe, the creation of stars and galaxies. He is then transported into a version of our world created by the aliens; in here he quickly grows older and older until he dies and is reborn as the star-child. Through him man has been taken to the next level of existence.2001: A Space Odyssey is a masterpiece of cinema. It is one of the very few films that can claim to be pure science fiction. Its dramatics are sparse and its pace is slow. But it needs this deliberate pace to accentuate its scope. It makes you feel the vastness and loneliness of space and the mysteries it conceals. And it openly invites you to immerse yourself in the beauty of it all. It's a crowning achievement in showing what cinema can be as a pure art-form. This is certainly not a film for everyone, its themes are so big that it lacks the human touch that some may feel is important. For me this is not a concern as by immersing myself in this film I am able to truly feel the mysterious nature of our solar system and the universe in general, and as well as being a visual tour-de-force, it always leaves me with questions and not just answers. And I like that.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Unbelievable; visionary,"I have seen 2001 all of twice now, but I will never cease to marvel at what an astounding accomplishment it is.  I have never seen a film with such amazing vision.  Everything in it seems so incredibly well and completely though out.  Kubrick is, no question, the bravest director I've ever seen. What other director would have an overture, intermission, entre'acte and exit music now?  The space sequences are truly silent, whereas Armageddon, for example, fills it with useless noise.  It gives the real feeling of a void, a vacuum, of emptiness and infinity itself.  2001 is a visual opera. It tests the limits of cinema and the very imagination.  I have never seen another movie that required real existential discussion afterwards.  This movie, though it is over 30 years old, has the greatest special effects of any ever.  The ending sequence may be the greatest 20 minutes ever captured on film.  The title is perfect: ""Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite.""  How it was done is beyond me.  How Kubrick could have ever even imagined it is totally beyond me.  I would say right now that this is the greatest film I have ever seen.  It is a masterpiece.  The film world is immeasurably poorer without Kubrick, but it owes him an eternal debt.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
MORE EXCITING THAN TARKOVSKY!,"It is difficult to see clearly now (after decades of Star Wars and Star Trek on the more commercial side of space films) ) but this was a groundbreaking film, brave even in its most mystical scenes, deliberately (and hypnotically) tedious, with one certified great villain in HAL, easily the most human performance in the film. The ""light show"" in the middle is stunningly dull now, bereft as we are of the necessary mescaline, 2000 light years from Woodstock, and stuck in the checkout line. But this is a bearable indulgence. Like so many Kubrick films (apart from ""Strangelove"") this demands a more-than-average forbearance, but, after seeing Tarkovsky, this becomes less severe in comparison.

A masterpiece 50 years later,"I watched this classic film the other day on blu-ray, and all the things I love are there : the masterfully chosen classical music pieces (especially the Strauss pieces and Khatchaturian's Gayane ballet piece for the establishing shots of the Discovery ship), the intricate model work of the ships and moonbase - featuring those influential cut out shots to show tiny crews and computer screens - and the abstract ending, which has been dividing audiences for decades. I was taken to this film as a child in one of its 70's revival theatre showings (it was one of my parents' favourite films) and I can't really remember what I made of it then, but this film has been there with me at different stages of my life (like the monolith in the film at different stages of evolution) and probably always will be.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Very bad film, very good 1960's experimental arty-cinema!","I saw this film when I was very young. Obviously, I didn't have a clue what was going on and I hated it. A couple of weeks ago I read Arthur C. Clarke's superb book (and the sequels) and felt I had to give the film another chance.My opinion of the film has not changed since my first viewing, I still hate it. I can appreciate it on other levels now, but to me, as a film, this does not work. The reason there are no other films even remotely like this is because this is not how films are supposed to be. This is more art than film (in a bad way).I cannot understand how ANYBODY could watch this film (without reading the book) and know what is going on, but in my opinion, you should never have to read the book to understand a film.Some people might say it transcends film, cinema and traditional storytelling, but whilst I can't say whether or not it actually transcends all that stuff, it certainly isn't any of that stuff. It is like one of those weird pieces of experimental video-art you get in trendy art galleries, only two hours long.The magic of the book lies in it's narrative, and on the descriptions of cosmic events. I'm sure Mr Kubrick did the best he could in '68, but SFX technology was NOWHERE NEAR advanced enough to get across some of the things that were meant to be happening, so they used stuff like false colour on sped up clouds, which may have dazzled audiences then, but cannot remotely compare to how your imagination pictures it whilst reading the book.(As a side note, the bits where they were supposed to moving around in zero-G actually had me in tears they were so bad! But I'm sure they couldn't have done it any better at the time)   To anyone who didn't like this film, please read the book, because it is amazing, and if anything it will explain the story so you can watch the ""film"" for sheer cinematographical appreciation.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
2001: A Space Odyssey,"The top 6 reasons why ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is my favorite movie:1. The visual effects are stunning for it's time, 1968. Several Science Fiction movies have borrowed directly from 2001, including Star Wars; just compare the looks of the Imperial Cruisers in SW and the Odyssey in 2001.2. The details and accuracy are splendid.3. The music – all classical tracks - add a unique touch to 2001. Basically, the more alien the scenery, the more mystical and atonal the music.4. The lack of narration adds to the mystery of 2001, leaving the audience to speculate about the meaning of everything.5. Most scenes in space are very slow, adding realism. Also, when Dave and Frank go EVA, you can only hear their breathing and the hiss of gasses flowing into the space-suit. It feels like you are in space yourself!6. All human characters are flat and bored, whereas HAL9000, the super computer, has the most vivid personality of all. I believe this reflects both Clarke's tendency to focus on the Science rather than humans, and Kubricks cynical look on humanity.All in all, a fantastic movie, still! TEN STARS!!!The sequel, ""2010: The Year We Make Contact"" (or ""2010: Odyssey Two"" as the title for the novel) is a worthy film in itself. However, it is completely different in style and feel, and rightly so. I guess Hyams who directed it did not make an attempt to make it similar to 2001 in any sense. A wise decision, I think...",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The movie about everything,"2001: A Space Odyssey was released in 1968 and It was directed by Stanley Kubrick, one of the most versatile filmmakers of all time.By the time of the movie's release Stanley Kubrick has made a name for himself with films like Paths of Glory, Spartacus, Lolita and Dr. Strangelove. Lolita and Dr. Strangelove met with both critical and commercial acclaim along some serious controversy. It was no different with 2001 either.The film focuses on our past,present and future. Each act has It's different feel as they are told in different ways.First act is slow and mysterious,the second is fun and relaxing,and the climax is unlike anything people have ever seen.The way these acts are connected is loose and it makes for a very mysterious atmosphere. The use of classical music is very smart and It makes the movie that more ageless. Special effects are one of the best and most creative.The movie is not for everyone, It might be slow and confusing for some,but being in the right mindset and thinking about these ideas makes this a very compelling film to watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
2001: A Space Odyssey is probably the best Sci-Fi film in history,"2001: A Space Odyssey is probably the best Sci-Fi film in history. It was shot more than 50 years ago, but still looks great and relevant. It is difficult to imagine what impression the film left in the audience in 1968. Kubrick is clearly a genius, especially for his filming of the ending of the film. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a real pillar of all Sci-Fi cinema, it is difficult to imagine how many paintings drew inspiration from A Space Odyssey.

Rough viewing....,"One thing is certain, watching this movie is tough. There is SO much going on, so many things easily over looked. It's easy to see why so many dislike it and/or don't understand it. It's not so easy to see why anyone idolizes it, but I can. It contains some pretty amazing stuff. I completely agree with what one review said about saying that had I not known what year this movie was made, I would have not guessed correctly. My guess would have been along the lines of late 70's to early 80's, which alone says something about the movie. It definitely make you think as well.Negatives? Soundtrack is repetitive as hell. If anyone denies that then they're just lying. It gets annoying and takes some enjoyment out of the film. Some scenes ARE too dragged out. I'm not in any hurry when it comes to movies, but good lord.The final scenes.....whew....they will be talked about till the end of time, and for good reason. This was one of the unreasonably long scenes. It was almost torture. Maybe that's the way Kubrick meant to portray it, idk. I joked saying that the character in the movie was probably praying for death, and that the wrinkles were probably a result of unheard of boredom. The perfect word is ""assault"". The final scene is a relentless assault, and although amazing, it's excruciating at the same time.This movie is a remarkable thing, but I'm not sold on how great of a movie it is. It just doesn't have a lot of substance. People will disagree and say I just don't understand it, but it just drags...period.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Breathtaking and Risk-Taking; Kubrick and Clarke's Offspring is a True Masterwork,"This timeless collaboration between Stanley Kubrick (the progressive filmmaker) and Arthur C. Clarke (the conceptual novelist) is more of a thoughtful anthology, three distinct but connected stories, than a single cohesive whole. It might even be argued that the tripped-out last act, technically a coda to the HAL 9000 arc, makes for a surplus fourth chapter, but we don't need to get too in-depth on that point. There's almost too much to laud.Stylistic mash-ups like this one, pairings of intrinsically unique mediums, don't always go well, but 2001 manages to harvest the best of both worlds without losing the innate qualities that make each so successful. We share the heady, scientific honesty, deep intellectual enigmas and pinpoint social forecasts of a great science fiction novel (or several, as it were), plus the majestic visual effects, tangible characterization and meticulous timing of a top-shelf motion picture. In other words, Kubrick stuns us with artistry, dramatic proficiency and general ingenuity, while Clarke sees to it that everything still feels human and tickles our brains with limitless abstract possibilities. What a perfect partnership.Inconceivably influential, too, as the stark point of transition from the hammy Flash Gordon tinfoil swashbucklers of the 50s and early 60s to the more intelligent, considered space operas of the forthcoming decade. This is a film that was released before we set foot on the moon, but already seems to know how a prolonged life amongst the stars will feel. There's so much to love, from the magnificent cinematography (my GOD, such photography) to the deliberate pacing (allowing us to step inside this world and appreciate its nuances). The sweeping symphonic score (which sees to it that we scarcely notice the EIGHTY COMBINED MINUTES without dialogue) to the haunting, perplexing thematic storytelling (loaded with smart, understated performances).If anything gives me pause, it's the deep sense of impenetrability that often settles over long stretches of screen time, particularly that daring (and baffling) climactic sequence. But then, as Clarke said so succinctly just after its release, ""If you understand 2001 on the first viewing, then we've failed."" This is one nut that's worth the effort of cracking. A certifiable masterpiece that still leaves me asking, ""How did they do that in 1968?""",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A '10' in 1968; a '6' in 2021,"I can imagine that this movie would be mind-blowing in 1968. The production quality is surprisingly very high-tech and modern, far more advanced than movies made in the 60s. In fact, the production value could pass for today, however there is no way a movie in this day and age would be allowed to run amok with super-long, super-slow scenes if it wants to keep its viewers' attention. Today's audience has no patience for mysterious, soundtrack-laden, no-dialogue scenes, and instead expects tightly-edited narratives that they can engage with. That is not this movie, hence, in 2021 this rates as a 6.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Cure for Insomnia,"This has to be, without a doubt, the single most boring atrocity ever to grace the silver screen. I first had the misfortune of watching this film several years ago, when someone I knew forced me to see it, telling me it was one of the greatest films of all time. Ha! They couldn't be further from the truth! So what are its problems? The pace, for one thing. There are extended periods where people move slowly, and everything is quiet. This is an attempt to be scientifically accurate (it's in space, after all), but there is far too much of this in the film--all the great filmmakers have techniques of briefly illustrating effects like this for you, then moving on with the story. The other annoyance is how the film keeps cutting back to shots of animals. I remember the scene where the monkeys are playing with the bones. An absurd shot that's not very interesting at all. About the only thing about the film that's any good is the music, and by that, I am just referring to the Strauss pieces (Richard and Johann). Which, if I were either of those men, I'd sue the makers of this movie. Kubrick is probably the worst director of all time, and after being forced to sit through this one, I look forward to never seeing one of his films again, as long as I live!
I should say this film does have one redeeming quality. If you have trouble sleeping, this is the cure you've been waiting for!",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Study of Intellectual Evolution,"2001 is probably the most technically perfect film ever made. It is a study in the intellectual evolution of mankind. The premise is that an outside entity is enabling our journey through the use of the monolith. The monolith gives the apes the ability to reason. Not insignificantly, Moonwatchers first thought is the use of a weapon (the bone). This changes everything. This new species is able to conquer its rivals, changing itself from hunted to hunter, allowing the species to flourish. Moonwatcher throws the bone in the sky and it morphs into a nuclear space station. Eons have gone by in an instant but man has not changed at all. The rest of the movie deals with the next step in man's intellectual evolution beginning with the discovery of the monolith on the moon. This can be seen symbolically in the ships that are used, signifying man's ""re-birth"". The space station is an unfertilized egg and Floyd's shuttle is the sperm. Conception occurs at docking. The probe to the moon is the fertilized zygote implanting itself in the womb (the moon). And of course, Discovery is the soon to be born child, the monolith by Jupiter the birth canal. New man no longer needs a body and is pure energy.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Journey Beyond the Stars,"2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY is one of the most exploratory and daring science fiction films ever made and one of the best overall films made in the latter part of the 20th century. The combined vision of Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick, basing the screenplay on Clarke's novel, created a visual and aural masterpiece closer to realism than any science fiction film that preceded it. The film was released in 1968, at a time of political and social upheaval: while the Apollo space program headed closer and closer to the moon, young men were being drafted into Vietnam and the voices of college students around the country began to be heard.2001 was (and perhaps always will be) unlike any other science fiction film. It begins with a rendition of Richard Strauss' `Also Sprach Zarathustra (Thus Spake Zarathustra)' slowly building up as the opening credits appear during a lunar eclipse (as each sphere overshadows the one preceding it). For the next seventeen or so minutes, we are introduced to `The Dawn of Man.' A group of apes struggle to survive in a rough African landscape. (It should be noted that humans portray these apes, so realistically that it seems like we are watching a documentary on the Discovery Channel.) The apes live in a waterhole; the only source of water for miles, the waterhole is the apes' paradise. This then becomes the locale for conflict between two groups of apes. The main ape (called `Moon-Watcher' in the novel) unleashes his `discovery' (bone as weapon) on a member of the other group. Soon we are introduced to the monolith, a mysterious huge black rectangular slab that will serve as a link between the four parts of the film.In one of the most famous jump cuts in cinema history, Moon-Watcher hurls the bone into the air; it rises and turns slowly, transforming into a bone-shaped satellite. This sudden evolution, from ape to man, will remind us of the bone, and will introduce us to the next `discovery' of man: technology. Like the bone, the satellite is both a tool and a weapon; the data collected by satellites can easily be used for destructive purposes.In the second part of the film, `4 Million Years Later,' we meet the first `actor' in William Sylvester, who portrays an intentionally bland Dr. Heywood Floyd. Floyd is more politician than scientist, as he dismisses rumors (brought up by Russian scientists) of an epidemic outbreak at the lunar Clavius Base. This part of the film portrays lengthy scenes of Floyd's ship docking, first at the wheel-shaped space station, then on the lunar surface. Within, life is made up of politicians and scientists within white walls, mechanical doors, and bright lights. Outer space, meanwhile, is silent and black. And breathtakingly beautiful.The lifelessness of the human characters in 2001 is intentional, because WHAT WE SEE is the true star of the film. In the  `Jupiter Mission-18 Months Later' sequence of the film, we meet the bone-shaped spaceship Discovery, a representation of man's achievements in technology; two astronauts, Dr. David Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Dr. Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood), both of whom man the ship while the other three astronauts are in hibernation; and perhaps one of the most memorable characters in film, the HAL 9000 supercomputer (voiced by Douglas Rain), a living computer (to us, a red glassy eye) that has the ability to think on its own, and thus can make its own decisions. The Discovery depicts man's life in outer space, more so than the second part of the film: a place for exercise (Frank jogging), leisure (Frank playing chess, Dave drawing sketches), and research (the various work the astronauts do on the ship). HAL 9000 can be both a tool (serving as the protector of Discovery) and a weapon (eliminating those interfering with the mission, which we will soon discover). The film offers a lot of emotion in the character of HAL 9000. HAL is the central character of this part of the film. As a computer, he cannot repress his emotions for the sake of the mission (as Dave and Frank do, having been trained in the space program). Only when a vital component of the communication system seems to fail does HAL discover his own imperfection, and the mission is ultimately jeopardized. A revelation into the purpose of the Jupiter mission (and a revelation into the purpose of the monolith) leads us to one of the most stunning, fascinating sequences caught on film, as Dave descends from the spaceship Discovery and enters Jupiter's atmosphere in the final part of the film, `Jupiter-And Beyond the Infinite.'2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY can be a major disappointment, especially now that we have reached it but are not traveling to the moon during summer vacation. Clarke used the year not because he felt we would be excavating monoliths on the moon by the year 2001, but because it's symbolic, it IS the year of the new millennium, the year that will continue for us the life begun in evolution. We will one day realize the effects of 2001 the film, and when that occurs, life to us would seem very ordinary.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The coloring book of film,"What can you say about a film that inspired Tom Hanks to act, a film that inspired Christopher Nolan to direct? A film with hardly any dialogue or Plot asks the viewer to place their own subconscious into each frame. From the birth of man to first contact, 2001 is the most ambiguous film ever made, from when it was released until now. Their is no shame in not understanding the meaning of 2001: a space odyssey because the meaning is completely up to the viewer. 2001 was envisioned that way, written that way, and directed that way on purpose. Stanley Kubrick does not wish to inform the viewer but dares them to feel, whether it be the cold heart of silent space or a machine with more emotion than man. It still astonishes to this day that there is not a single computer effect in this entire movie just real props on a real stage making pure movie magic and to believe it was conceived before humans landed on the moon or did Stanley fake that?(wink* wink*). If one attempts to watch 2001 enter with a open heart and an open mind, prepare to be awed!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A twisting tale where man faces the task of understanding time itself,"2001: A Space OdysseyStanley Kubrick's 1968 release, 2001: A Space Odyssey, truly revolutionized the film industry by creating something never before seen on camera. Kubrick, with the help of writer, Arthur C. Clarke, was able to create a mind-bending tale completely left open to interpretation thanks to an inconclusive ending that provides more questions than answers. It has to be considered as the movie that shaped cinematic sci-fi as it is know today as well as one of the best movies ever made. Due to the film's thought provoking characters, lack of dialogue, cinematography, and incredible score as well as many other positives, 2001 is lifted to new heights in comparison to many other movies of the genre. The film takes place over millions of years, beginning with apes and the ""dawn of man."" A mysterious black box appears that can connect all of time. This progresses to man at the beginning of the 21st century where they are attempting to conquer space. Several astronauts and a form of artificial intelligence are sent on an unknown mission. The astronauts begin to discover that the A.I., HAL 9000, cannot be trusted and enter the duel between man and machine. This leads to a twisting tale where man faces the task of understanding time itself. From the beginning, Kubrick knew he wanted to make a very intellectual film. In order to achieve this, he knew he had to have thought provoking characters whether they were human or an advanced form of artificial intelligence. He succeeds. Dr. Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) quickly become intriguing to the audience when they begin their mysterious mission into space. Through characterization and empathy, viewers can connect to the two astronauts and are able to put themselves in the astronauts' seemingly hopeless position. However, the character that completely changes the game is not even human. HAL, the computer system on the ship, is the most complexing personality in the entire film. At first, the viewer does not know what to think of the machine. His goal is to help the astronauts achieve the mission but at the same time, it seems like HAL is hiding something. Throughout the rest of the film, the viewer attempts to understand HAL and his actions. BY doing this, audiences are drawn straight into the movie from start to finish. It has been calculated that 2001 has roughly eighty minutes of film that contains absolutely no dialogue. Although this seems strange and unappealing, it actually enhances the viewing experience. In multiple scenes, the only thing audiences can hear is the heavy breathing of the astronauts when they are in their suits. They do not say a single word. This creates a sense of austerity as the astronauts fulfill their mission traveling through space. Humans are completely out of their comfort zone and must even learn how to breathe again. Dialogue is only used when absolutely necessary and leaves a lot to up to the audiences' inferences. This, in turn, creates a very intelligent film that requires a viewer to be thinking throughout the movie. The audience is in a sense, required to solve problems and understand issues just like the astronauts are. The cinematography in 2001 is simply breathtaking to put it frankly. Geoffrey Unsworth, the cinematographer, and Kubrick were able to film things that nobody at the time could even imagine to film. As Kubrick put it, ""If it can be written, or thought, it can be filmed."" The weightless motion of a pen is able to be created and filmed in a studio affected by gravity. A point-of-view shot is used to show the audience how HAL views the world. A ""stargate sequence"" is created and somehow filmed superbly (much of the info on how that sequence was filmed is still unknown due to it being kept confidential by Kubrick). The musical score in 2001 successfully creates the world in which the characters interact. Kubrick uses classical pieces written by Richard Strauss and several others throughout the film that make space seem vast yet mysterious. These pieces set the mood for each scene whether they are suspenseful and tense, or just simply present so the viewer can observe the wonders of space. 2001: A Space Odyssey is simply incredible and contains very few, if any, flaws. At times, specifically the beginning, the movie can be a little slow and takes time to develop. This makes it somewhat challenging for the average movie- goer to ""get into"" the movie. However, this is a matter of opinion and can be different depending on who is watching the movie. Kubrick's thriller through space and time is not for everyone. As stated earlier, some viewers may find it challenging to enjoy a movie that takes time to develop while containing less dialogue than most other films. However, for all other audiences, it is a must-see film that leaves the viewer looking for answers and pondering the ending for days. 2001: A Space Odyssey is simply put, an incredible viewing experience that deservedly earns a 10 out of 10 rating.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Visual Poetry - a landmark achievement,"One of the seminal points in the development of film and cinema. Future directors like Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and James Cameron, to mention just a few, were massively inspired by this film. Its easy to see why.Kubrick evolved film making conventions considerably. The plot is decidedly ambiguous and thinly sketched so as to force the audience to understand and interpret it themselves, with very little exposition, and deliberately trivial or even banal dialogue. Compared to Kubrick's previous films, there is no verbal narration beyond the films division into the sections of 'Dawn of Man', 'Jupiter Mission', and 'Jupiter - Beyond the Infinite'. The film if full of ambiguous symbolism, which forces the viewer to invest in the picture viscerally. You then have to reflect on the experience to get anything from it. Albeit this only works as a viewing experience if you are very patient.Acting performances are not really the point of this film, with William Sylvester, Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood giving deliberately controlled, restrained, even bland performances which are designed to create a sense of detachment from the characters. The only character that is genuinely interesting is the man-ape Moonwatcher, played brilliantly by Daniel Richter.Technical credits are really the driver for this film. Production Design by Terry Masters and his team is excellent, working in great collaboration with Geoffrey Unsworth, resulting is staggeringly amazing cinematography, that still looks brilliant by today's standards. He is a genius at simulating natural light and conditions on indoor studios. This is further re-enforced by Kubrick's signature camera-work The visual effects are still hugely impressive, even by today's CGI dominating standards, and for the most part the miniature work is fantastic, as is filming on the simulated centrifuge on the discovery spacecraft. There are some minor quibbles, for example there is a scene set in zero G where the stewardess walks in a circle but seems to walk too far for where you would expect the cockpit to be, and there are some views out of windows that don't seem to correct for the angle that the spacecraft are flying at.These issues are nevertheless more than compensated for by the amazing experience of watching the film, particularly with the marrying of image with existing classical music. Alex North, whom Kubrick worked with on Spartacus, had written 40 minutes of score, but this was discarded when Kubrick elected to use his choices of classical music, which works amazingly well. It leads to an original, fascinating experience, that feels very poetic and highly visceral.In many ways, its the ultimate silent movie, relying more on music rather than dialogue to tell the story from an auditory point of view",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Film Liquet on 2001: A Space Odyssey,"Starting with the Dawn of time, the history of mankind is portrayed as it evolves, encountering a mysterious black monolith in both, the pre-evolution humanity stages and the futuristic world of 2001. A timeless classic, the Space Odyssey is argued to be one of Kubrick's finest works, as it features one of the most well-known Match cuts in the history of cinema and was determined to be the ""ultimate science fiction movie"", as Kubrick said.Even after 50 years from the release, people are still talking about it and asking the same questions that still haven't been answered.In addition to an interesting plot, the movie was known to adapt groundbreaking camera techniques that would later inspire new filmmakers all around the world, seeing as Kubrick intended to break the set norms.Even though we speak of it as the timeless cinema classic, the Space Odyssey for many is quite hard to watch. It features long scenes devoid of action, to which the modern audience is not used. We have adapted the idea that films must always show us things and tell us what is going on, thus breaking the basic rule of filmmaking - show, don't tell. In doing so, the modern audiences have been desensitised and are not used to the film making us think. The Space Odyssey is still a brilliant film. First following a mysterious astronaut mission in deep space, it then comes to a tense showdown, paralleling Homer's Odyssey and even after the conflict is resolved the film takes the audience further than anticipated, giving each member of the audience to interpret the film differently.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The grand-daddy of epic art,"How often do you get to see a work of art gifted a budget on this scale? It's hardly ever happened in history and this is what happens when it does happen, 2001 A Space Odyssey. It's a film that changed cinema in many ways, a film that inspired many film artists and continues to influence many directors presently.Whenever a director wants to compare himself as one of the best, he almost always references 2001 and that tells you why 2001 is one of the most important films... and possibly the most important in American history.There's so much that's different about 2001, particularly the structure of the film which was revealed in the Stanley Kubrick documentary as mode-jerking, instead of a 3 act structure. This simply says that the film is episodic, instead of having a beginning, middle and end.It's a film that takes you back to a prehistoric act that probably references the first act of violence, represented as man's invention of a tool, that's used for killing and to feed ourselves. I say ''man'' because that's probably how Kubrick is representing evolution... but it isn't necessarily so. We then take a giant leap for mankind into the space age.First we're in a mission to the moon, then a mission to jupiter. Both these missions are about government secrecy and mysteries that hold the key to civilization. I'm not going to get into the story, but what I love about this movie is the main usage of classical music with the way its placed with the footage in space. Kubrick has mostly succeeded in creating a true 3 dimensional space without cheap 3D effects or CGI, yet the special effects was a quantum leap for cinema.One of the highlights for me was the character HAL 9000, the computer who exhibited higher emotion than the humans, a common argument in films about man becoming more like machines.Then there's the finale, without dialogue for long stretches of time, 2001 is an experience that needs to be felt and doesn't need straight answers.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Fascinating, Mind Blowing, Exceptional, Unprecedented, Quirky Masterpiece of Cinema..One of the most important films of all time","After recently watching this for the second time, my opinion of it has wildly changed. My first impression was mediocrity and that it was just a random orchestration of wild images. Yet after watching it again with closer convictions, I've epiphanised that not only is this much higher than mediocrity, this is one of the most influential and important films ever made.The Film starts with the dawn of man in which a group of primates are shown surviving in the wilderness of early earth. Then the monolith mystically appears, this enigma causes awe by the primates. This sense of extraordinary awe is increased by Kubricks exceptional choice of music. Shortly after, the first act of weaponry is discovered through a primate picking up a bone and using it violently...this is the birth of human intelligence.Then the story of astronaut Bowman is ensued which involves the iconic figure of HAL. I would try to expand on the story line but it's simply a film you need to watch yourself.These monoliths that appeared in the dawn of man appear three times throughout the film, Kubrick stated that these monoliths symbolise a method of alien intelligence observing the development of human kind, yet it should be stressed that interpretation is PURELY subjective.This is a very visual film hence why it won the 1968 Oscar for visual effects. The effects are simply awe-inspiring and dazzling. The first 25 minutes of the film have no dialogue and the last 23 minutes also have no dialogue. With the beginning and end included, there is 88 minutes of non-dialogue in the whole film!. Is this lack of dialogue a thing to be criticised with?. No, these beautiful scenes of melded imagery and sound make this a groundbreaking accomplishment of epic proportions.Why is this considered as one of the greatest films of all time?. Well its an original insight into the existence of earth and also about the life outside of earth. This film will make you wonder and think, it throws more questions at you than answers much like the reason for our existence. This is one of the greatest Sci-Fi film ever made (yes as good if not better than star wars) and i believe this is one of Kubrick's very best cinematic achievements.Bravo Kubrick! 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Some Love It, Some Hate It","I'm personally in the grey area.I love Kubrick, I think he's a technical genius (a mad one) when it comes to filmmaking and this one is his testament of how good he is on the technical side. On the story side, Kubrick isn't that fantastic. This movie is not meant to be understood nor was it meant to be answered. This movie is a technical marvel that has groundbreaking visual effects that stood the test of time. This movie is fantastic BUT...I didn't really enjoy it as much as I hoped for... not to say I hate it, I think it's amazing but it didn't hook me like the rest of the critics that seems to be saying it's the best Sci-Fi movie (even though this one goes in to my top 10 easily). This movie just doesn't grab me. It's a shame because I do love it but I just don't find it that fascinating (the whole hype surrounding it probably killed it for me).

"I was afraid to watch it 2016, but left the cinema relieved and again: speechless","I was afraid, because I saw this movie in the 80's. And now I am 30 years older. And maybe it was just a hype of youth at that past time. So many SciFi-movies have been done since the production of 2001. How can 2001 contest with more modern movies. But wrong wrong wrong. 2001 is a monolith placed in the center of all SciFi-movies, like the monolith in the picture itself is placed in the soul of human thinking. I was afraid, that the computer screens and the space shops will look old-fashioned. But no no no. The red eye of Hal is timeless. And the furniture? We do not know. Maybe in 100 years they will look again like the 60's. And the computer screens? Simple graphics. Not overloaded. Maybe this is the future. And the action? So damn'd slow. So wonderful slow. And the end? Ah! The end. Zarathustra and the unborn and the Jupiter filling the picture. Timeless high-tech met timeless music met timeless thinking. Kubrick!, it is unbelievable how you could do this! I was very lucky to see this movie again today, in 2016. I was lucky to see a true 70 mm copy with analog picture and analog sound, shown and played in one of the best cinemas on earth (Gartenbaukino in Vienna). Before the movie started the audience was asked, how many had not seen this movie before. I guess, around 15% lifted their hands. Lucky them! 10 stars of 10. And 10 stars of 10 it will be as long as human kind exists and all the new forms of life thereafter. And I ask, God yourself, did you see this movie? You should.

Allegory of The Lonely Space Traveler,"The feeling watching this of utter loneliness of those who have dedicated their lives as explorers of Space. The only contact for the explorers with those on Earth is through video telecoms. There are few other crew in the various vehicles as the astronauts are hurtled through Space, further reinforcing loneliness. One starts to imagine that due to the risks of their mission, they may never return home.The technology is rather timeless considering that most electronics in 1968 was still mostly vacuum tube based and something as simple as a pocket calculator was yet to be invented.The movie is refreshing to watch knowing that all the special effects were low tech and manually produced but yet having portrayed advanced technology that has still not yet been achieved (HAL9000 AI computer with human traits).",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Horrible.,"This movie is so bad, I can't even find a word in the dictionary to describe it. Why on earth would anyone want to see this? Stanley Kubrick has got to be the most overrated director in the history of cinema. I don't think there's ever been a director who's made so many bad movies and is hailed as a God. The whole movie is pictures and music, or what some of you would call ""art."" There's like maybe a half hour of talking in a movie that's over two hours. So much time is spent on the ""art"" of this movie that it doesn't even feel like a movie. God, you go to the museum to see art, you go to the movies to have a good time. I cannot even describe the agony of watching this film. In fact, it was so bad I had to get up every other minute and walk around. You will never in your life see such a boring picture. This is THE most boring and overrated movie of ALL TIME. How does Kubrick do it? It seems that all he has to do is make a movie that no one understands and everyone goes nuts over it! I could have shown scenes of space and men in space and mammals beating each other with bones and would it be called one of the best films of all time? I even tried using my imagination to ""look"" for something in the movie that I thought I wasn't getting but I couldn't even get over the fact that I was still watching it. Is this even classified as a movie, or is it a space slide show? Yes, it's beautiful, but I wanted to see a freaking film. Don't recommend this to friends. They'll shoot you. Kubrick once again steals the show with a real dud. Psychologists should show this film to people as part of an experiment on boredom. You'll wanna ship this movie off into space, or at least go to space yourself to get away from it. Ignore all the hype, this movie is a waste of your time. It's NOT entertainment. Kubrick needed to realize why people go to the movies. This is possibly one of the worst films ever, and it's praised as a masterpiece! Ahh!",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"One of a Kind, Top of the World, Ma!","The most demanding movie ever made by an American director, and the most unique since Griffith's Intolerance. Impossible to imagine anyone having a mixed reaction to this one, it seems to polarize audiences like no other. If you totally flip for it, you might choose to give up your friends who hated it. Unpleasant thought, but such is this movie's power. Even its first young ""hippie"" audiences needed weed to get them through it, though the movie itself provides its own hallucinations if you give it the chance. It expands cinema and makes true movie lovers see how small most other films are.

The Privilige of Becoming Human,"Among stars, the huge vacuum of space, we are minimal, we are just blurry spots questioning our existence. In space we discover our importance, and Kubrick highlights from a sequence of the dawn of men (hominids) that we are in our expressive pinnacle and can ask many questions without any real answers.This movie is not conventional: it seems superficial to talk about characters, plot, bad people or heroes. This film is more likely a search, an inner quest. There is no need to have strong explanations, because in the ignorance and inaction of mind we find the beauty that makes us human.Stanley Kubrick uses onirical production stages, disorienting cameras, psychedelic effects, brutal mix of colors.""2001"" is just an answer, very mixed in its conception, but needed for those who ask constantly: -Who are we?

"Visual masterpiece and pure artistry, I just don't get it","This is one of those reviews where you are just crucifying yourself for no reason. As you can see, the score is still positive and I like this movie, but I most admit, it just didn't hit me as hard as it should. Kubrick is, and will always be, one of my absolute favorite directors. His eye for visual perfection is incredible in this movie and might even be at it´s best. The way movie magic is displayed right in front of you and details and sets are made are absolutely incredible. But let me be honest, I don't get it. I am a person that weigh human stories and emotions high when I watch movies, I weigh gripping and hard hitting storytelling heigh and visuals are just a way to enhance this. This movie can get a bit lost in perfected visuals to really tell me anything. While I understand what Kubrick wants you SHOW me I don't understand what he wants to TELL me. I fully understand the love for this movie, but I simply don't get the grip.A monolith is seen in the past and found in our future. Scientist research it and find out there is a signal from the moon to Jupiter. Humans send and expedition to Jupiter to uncover the truth about the monolith.This movie is a visual and artistic masterpiece. It´s been a while since I´ve seen such a visually striking movie. While some backgrounds can look fake in the beginning segment, every single other visual aspect is done to perfection. Kubrick allows us to stay with the striking visuals, he takes his time to really hit home the beauty of our planet, the future and space. The shots are well thought-out and all so visually striking. The use of scale, and especially color makes everything look like a painting. The use of movement of objects and camera creates this beautiful visual symphony that is to die for. I see this movie as a sort of Fantasia (1940) comparison. It´s more of an experience piece than a story one and the combination of color, framing, music and design makes this movie worth experiencing no doubt. I think there is so much to get from this movie, and I totally understand why it has stood the test of time as one of the greatest sci-fi epics. It is an odyssey in that way, a visual masterpiece that needs to be seen.This is especially helped by the absolutely incredible set design and prop designs. This movie looks so visually distinct, and everything looks so fitting and perfect for this movie. Every space craft, every room, all the small details, all the buttons, text on screens and the inner workings of the world is absolutely incredible and gripping. Again, the colors play a role, but also the just pure design of things. When people walk on walls in this movie, I am hit by the movie magic felling of ""how do they do that"" and that´s magical. I love when a movie can pull the rug on me and make me feel entranced by it´s way of doing.The use of music in this movie is iconic and helps the Fantasia feeling I was talking about. Space has this lovely theme of wonder; the monolith theme is the scariest thing I´ve heard in a while and the movie is driven by it. The sound design in general is incredible, the scary breathing of spacemen and the quite nature of space. When an astronaut is lost in space I´m filled with so much dread and anxiety. It looks and sound so cold, alone and claustrophobic. The movie also has a moment towards the end that I find absolutely scary in it´s execution. This movie is such a trip, dread, fun, wonder. It has a bit of everything.There aren't much to say about the acting performances. It´s not really an acting movie but my favorite performance is the cold and calculated voice of Douglas Rain as HAL 9000, It´s such a great role that conveys so much with nearly nothing. And the character even had me emotional.The visuals are not only beautiful, but the effects still hold up to this day in my opinion. Every practical thing is the stuff of pure movie magic and everything filmed in a special effects way most be absolutely groundbreaking for the time. Even predating something as iconic as Star Wars (1977) really shows the daring of Kubrick.So this is where I most come clean and say why I don't feel like this movie is perfect for me. As mentioned, I´m fine with experimental movies and experiences that aren't centered around people. They can be incredible and moving and this movie also succeeds at that for the most. But for me, movies about individuals and strong human emotions are what hits me personally. This movie doesn't really have that in my opinion. Maybe you see it and that´s great. I just don't get what the movie is trying to tell me or what it´s actually about. Maybe you get it and that´s great. Maybe you like it because it has an open interpretation but to me I need just a little bit of what the director or artist wants to TELL me. Here I see what Kubrick wants to SHOW me, the wonders of space, the destruction of man, the human evolution, but I don't understand what the point of it is, especially with the ending in mind, which I have an interpretation of but don't want to spoil because it´s the ending. The only thing I can say is, new? Is the movie a metaphor for humans? God? Something else? I just don't know and that makes me engage with the movie less and the people in it that barely give me a reason to connect with them other than they are humans like me.I like this movie takes it´s time. Showing things in fun and creative ways. Shows the innerworkings of how everything look, work and sound. Accompanied by the music and it´s like watching a commercial for the future. Some things, I must admit, drag on just that little bit. For the most part I enjoy the slow tempo of the movie but once in a blue moon there are the moments that are dragging to me. And the color swapping stuff at the end, while pretty, dragged on a bit too long for me.2001: a space odyssey is just so tough to talk about because it´s one of those movies people just expect you to call one of your favorites. That´s why it takes so long to overcorrect everything, to make people understand you don't hate what´s going on and you appreciate all the artistry going into the movie, but calling this one of my favorites is just not going to happen. It´s too out there for me and you might get it all and really connect with everything, but I just didn't. Kubrick is still my favorite director, creating art that I call my favorites and even my favorite movie, this just isn't one of them.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great film that must be seen in a theater,"This is such a unique movie, relying almost totally on mood, abstraction and sensory experience rather than plot, that it can really only be properly experienced in a theater, preferably with a lot of other people. It is certainly one of the great movies and I have seen it many times. But it really falls flat on a TV screen. My wish has always been that more of what is in the Arthur C.

Total and utter tosh,"Having decided to watch this movie for the first time after 53 years I feel I have just lost 149 minutes of my life (I know now why I avoided it). Kubrick should have stuck with kicking the hell out of the homeless in subways. I watched this in 4k and the only think clear was the quality of the 4k transfer which was immaculate (hence 2 stars). Now I'm an intelligent guy and have watched hundreds of movies but I have to say this movie is just behind Tenet as to being the most anti-climatic load of tripe I have ever watched, it made absolutely no sense, and please to all the Kubrick sycophants, don't try to convince me otherwise.

Weird...Beautiful...2001: A Space Odyssey is a cinema landmark!,"On a rating scale of 0 to 100; I rate 2001: A Space Odyssey a score of 97.Thegreatestsciencefictionfilmevermade? Could be. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a film that explores the planets and does it beautifully, and is a grand scale epic that will be forever remembered by moviegoer's and critics alike. It's simply a little mastermind of an adventure sci-fi flick that gets more intriguing with every movement of the characters.The monoliths have been watching us. They gave us the ""evolutionary kick in the pants"" we needed to survive at the Dawn of Time. In 1999, we discovered a second monolith on the moon. Now, in the year 2001, the SS Discovery and its crew, Captains Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood), and their onboard computer, HAL-9000 (voiced by Douglas Rain), must discover what alien force is watching us...2001: A Space Odyssey is an ultimately confusing film the first time you watch it, but after you see it a couple more times (you will see it more than twice, guaranteed!) you'll start to hook on to the odd but endlessly amazing story-line. The special effects are truly extraordinary for Stanley Kubrick's 1968 film, and Kubrick himself does a brilliant job of trying to show the world his vision of the future in science with his stunningly put-together script, that's always open to frightening and new ideas. There are many more reasons to see this great film, like to watch Keir Dullea's ignored but excellently controlled performance, for  Douglas Rain's voice portrayal of HAL-9000's evil, which is bound to send a chill down your spine, and last but definitely not least, Kubrick's unexplainably great effort in directing such a memorable piece of film.Impossible to miss, impossible to forget.

The proverbial good science-fiction film (tv),"The quote is from Kubrick himself and it's still totally accurate for this movie. I don't know if any film fan can appreciate it but it's really a must see for all SF fan: we got everything: space, aliens, robots, origin of humanity Beyond this theme, it's a rare movie that mixes brilliantly a challenging script with amazing visuals! Sure as the movie is from 1968, some effects look sometimes a bit out of time but it still has more punch than most SF movies done after! For me, the explanation comes from Kubrick's simple vision: he shots SF like real daily life, with no big things: a big frame and slow pace are just needful as what we see is already extraordinary! I have fun to watch it now as I have picked Clarke's novels as my summer books (proof of the enduring quality of the work) and so I have just finished to read the novel: the two are really variations around the same stories and really help each other.

"""An excellent movie, felt like I travelled to space in 2 hours and back home""",This movie is about humans discovering a mysterious artificial object on the surface of lunar and with the help of an intelligent computer HAC 9000 and some astronauts sets out to find out what it really is.The plot of this movie is just too good to explain as I said before I felt like I actually travelled to space and back.

"the proverbial ""good"" science fiction movie-  meant to be seen on a BIG screen","Years from now, when quite possibly film studios decide that filming and screening motion pictures for theatrical distribution no longer will work out financially and make everything for DVD and TV and, Lord help us, cell phones and I-phones, 2001 will remain as one of those reminders of what would be eternally lost. If films like this can be made on celluloid and *intended* to be screened in full 70mm or 35mm glory for all to see in a packed theater, then there should be hope.Because, as it stands, Kubrick's masterwork, aside from being the rare landmark to be an attempt at transmogrifying the form of film itself (as Spielberg once noted, it's not entirely drama or documentary or science fiction), is all fine and well on TV, particularly in full widescreen DVD. But, at the least for those who have problems with the film (and it's not hard to have them), it could be a universal likelihood that it's so much a pure visual experience, so visceral and surreal and all 'als', that it deserves no less than to be seen at least once up tall on a screen too many feet tall (and, fingers crossed, someday on IMAX?)2001 has caused more debate than during presidential primaries. What the hell is up with this movie? The fact that we question it- and, perhaps, even ourselves for why we thought the way we did- is part of the experience, and the mystery, and depending on how much or how little you're willing to take on that mystery will determine what you think of the film. Is the monolith really an alien, or some nothingness that one can project whatever on to? Why does it make the high-pitched sounds on the moon when made into photo-fodder? Where is that crazy room that Bowman goes to at the end? And don't get me started on the 'star child'. It's all of this that, for me, makes it so unforgettable, and something that enriches the experience the more times its revisited.To be fair, even as much of a Kubrick nut I am, it's hard to say that I wasn't bored the first time seeing it at the age of 12 and not used to sci-fi/fantasy that went this... well, slow isn't the word exactly, but meditative, patient, like a story that is in no need to rush itself in lieu of the stylistic choices of the director. But a few years later, it worked better, then better still. While it goes without saying that it might just fall flat for some time and time again, for me it's one of those things like a marvelous piece of music, where revisiting it is part of the enjoyment of familiarity, but at the same time you might rediscover something else, or you might have even changed since the last time.It's surreal, trippy, courageous, revelatory, frustrating, bewildering, and firmly structured. From the continuously mind-blowing visual fx by Kubrick and Douglas Trumbull, from the ominous presence of HAL 9000(possibly as the eventual continuation of a bone thwacking ape), from every careful but broad-stroked piece of direction and subtle piece of acting, it's popular art at a high water mark. It's probably not the greatest of all films, but many others can only hope and try their absolute best to reach the levels Kubrick and Clarke reached, how it plunged the aspirations of what is ""out there"" among the stars and the galaxy to an intellectual point via the confounding magic of cinema (yes, I used the word magic).",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Like a work of art by Da Vinci or Michaelangelo, it just gets better with age and will stand the test of time. And, yes. When I first saw it way back in '68, I absolutely hated it. Approaching it with an open mind , I was totally blown away by it when I saw it from a new point of view in 1981. It has become one of my favorites and I watch it religiously twice a year.

2001: The Greatest Work of Art Ever Created by Cultured Man,"2001: A Space Odyssey My Notes and Interpretations By Scott HolmanOn the End - 	- As Bowman and space pod eject from the Discovery spacecraft we get a significant impulse of viewing a, so to say, new renaissance.  Perhaps this is because of the significant subconscious correlation between the mechanisms and sexual intercourse, the Discovery as a phallic image, and the pod as sperm.  These perhaps unrealized metaphorical entities symbolize the beginnings of an entirely new step.  The psychedelic leap which soon ensues is, symbolically speaking, a parallel between the path to conception and birth, and the same to death and the inevitable after-product. 	- Again, we have the linking of birth and death, as Bowman, fresh from the for-mentioned journey, finds himself thrown into a cold, different, and thoroughly disturbing new world, in the guise of the Louise XVI suite.  It is there that he is forced to confront his life as it would have been had he not been taken from it so abruptly.  After this eerily profound display, he is given an option; to live out the life he has just witnessed, or take place in the next step in human evolution.  Reaching for the solemn Monolith, possibly a fathomable image of God, his choice has been made.  He will now cease to become the working man, whose mind functions merely to control his body, but become the thinking man, whose body is nothing more than a vessel to hold his newly formed mind. -On the Banality of Characters - 	- In the views and opinions of the author, spontaneity is a prime step towards the development of personality.  In the films near future, as we have progressed into a thoroughly mechanical social order, so also have our personalities.  When a life leads such a linear and predictable pattern, there is little chance of freak alterations, lending every person his exclusive one-dimensionality. -On HALs Mutiny - 	- It is well believed that emotions are the key separation between man and animal.  Therefore anything endowed with these emotions is, perhaps non-technically, human (a la HAL).  However, humanity is not selective, but a package deal.  Therefor anyone filled with the essence of humanity carries the ability to act upon all that entails, whether helpful or harmful to those around him.  Perhaps no one can be good without the ability to do evil. -On Extraterrestrial Existence - 	- Anyone, whether confiding in the belief of God or not, must believe that the universe is infinite.  And in the infinite, an infinite amount of things are possible.  This then, ironically, makes it highly improbable that extraterrestrial life (or anti-life for that matter) does not exist. However, this also lends to the possibility that these beings would be, rather than the bug-eyed monsters of the perennial pulp magazines, unfathomable to earthbound minds.  It is therefore probable that these beings could exist in another spectrum, made up of a variety of unimaginable colors.  The same goes for lines of symmetry, and physical plains.  In infinity there can only exist infinity.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"It's okay, you don't like the movie, we get it.","To those of you that wrote negative reviews: If you hate the film, that's fine, hate it, don't recommend it to anyone, bash it if you have to; I won't pretend to think that you ""just don't understand it"" because I happen to think that you do, just as much as you shouldn't pretend to be so profoundly confounded to understand how people genuinely love this film.Writing a truly objective review of 2001: A Space Odyssey is virtually impossible. Being objective about it is as difficult an undertaking as understanding and contemplating the movie itself.Love it or hate it, 2001 is here to stay. The enduring quality of this film is that it is all at once thought-provoking, brilliant, insightful, frustrating, and monumentally tedious, and a kin to hitting one's thumb incessantly with a hammer and loving it, yet some of us acquiesce and revel in delight in trying to write our own reviews as expressly as we can.Everyone who loves the film fully understands why it's hated, and everyone who doesn't knows why it's a highly regarded art film.In my opinion, and this is just my opinion: It is one of the greatest science fiction films of all time because it dares to challenge perception and asks and answers some of the greatest questions in life: Who are we? Where did we come from? What are we doing here? And where are we going? As a result, we agree to disagree on the merits of the film.2001 is enigmatic. So much time is spent (some would say wasted) waiting: waiting for a ship to dock, waiting for dialogue, waiting for adventure, waiting for a narrator that will never come. Each of us has to be our own narrators, and that's a tall order to ask of any movie-watcher with stars in his or her eyes.As a fan, I agree, the movie is very tedious, but deservedly so, and that's okay. I accept the pace. The pace was purposeful and Stanley Kubrick took many artistic licenses. I don't expect everything to be handed to me on a silver platter in easy to understand morsels of flashy special effects, fast-paced action, and intense melodrama.It's a foregone conclusion that the film was loved and hated back in 1968, it's loved and hated in 2011, and it'll be loved and hated in the future.

Kubrick and Clarke team to form a poetic sci-fi marvel,"The first time I ever saw 2001: A Space Odyssey was when I was in middle school. It was on network television, and my father grabbed me just in time to see two apes using bones to bludgeon another ape to death in the middle of a large puddle of water. ""Watch what happens next,"" he said, sounding rather dramatic. Of course looking back on this, I know why this was so important to him. What I was about to see was one of the most memorable visual transitions in film history. An ape tosses his bone in the air. It rotates in slow motion, before succumbing to gravity, and as it falls, there is an abrupt cut to, of all places, outer space. In place of the bone is a spaceship, an exact graphic match.Not quite understanding what I had just seen, and being the inquisitive kid that I was, I found a copy of Arthur C. Clarke's novel of same name, and attempted to read it before I saw the complete film. After finishing the book, I was amazed by the ideas it put forth, and felt I was ready to view the film. I watched it in its entirety, and I again saw the bone to spaceship transition, but I still did not feel confident that I knew what the hell was going on.The significance of this startling image was not immediately apparent to me until I viewed the film again recently on the big screen. The abrupt nature of the transition serves to make the passage of time seem relatively insignificant, and in doing so, suggests that what we see as marvelous innovation (i.e.--technology and space exploration) is actually just a drop in the bucket in the greater universal scheme. Although this transition is the most memorable in the film, it represents only one of its several visual and aural matches that reflect upon the film's fictional exploration of the story behind human evolution.The film begins with a section entitled ""The Dawn of Man"". We are introduced to a pack of apes who wander around their grounds doing nothing but seeking food and water. When other apes intrude, they fill the air with wild shrieks, attempting to scare off the invaders. They have no way to hunt, and no way to defend themselves against predators. It is a very primitive existence.Then one night, the apes are awoken by an eerie, otherworldly sound. They emerge from their cave and find in front of it a giant black slab, perfectly smooth and sturdy. They are wary at first, but one by one, they gradually crowd around the monolith, as the sound grows louder and more discordant. Later, we see a single ape fidgeting aimlessly with an animal skeleton. Suddenly, the ape's face lights up with a sudden understanding. The air begins to fill with the music of Richard Strauss's ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"", a musical selection which this film immortalized (and is often referred to as ""The 2001 song""). We quickly see a close image of the monolith with the sun centered high above it, and we now see the monolith's results. The ape lifts one of the animal's bones high above his head and makes brutal clubbing motions. He has found his weapon.The next time another pack of apes threatens, he takes his newfound discovery, and uses it to beat one of the pack members to death. Thus, the dawn of man arrives, and the monolith's work has begun.The remainder of the film focuses on where man has gone since then, and towards the end, delves into where man might be going. And the monolith is omnipresent. The pacing is slow and deliberate, as one would expect from a Kubrick film, and while some might view it as cumbersome, others will revel in it due to the unforgettable imagery. Due to zero gravity environments, we see people walking on all four walls, and there are several shots in which people seem to walk upside down and around rooms. We again see the spaceships which resemble the bone and also giant space stations which revolve like a wheel, yet another symbol of human innovation.The amazing feat which Kubrick pulls off, however, is making it seem very real and plausible, rather than something purely science fictional. The shots seem almost like a ballet rather than an innovative sci-fi effect. Of course, having Johann Strauss's ""Blue Danube Waltz"" in the background helps with this, and I'd guess that the music was chosen for just that purpose.Following the stunning ""Blue Danube"" sequence, we are introduced to Dr. Heywood Floyd (William Sylvester) of the National Council of Aeronautics. He is heading to a base on the moon to investigate a finding which has been kept secret from the public. Along the way, we see more futuristic signs of innovation: an orbiting Hilton Hotel and a video phone. A foreshadowing dialogue with other doctors in the hotel relates just how secret and important the investigation is.When Dr. Floyd reaches the moon, we find out what the secret is. He and several other scientists descend into a giant trench which holds another monolith, identical to the one which catalyzed the ape transformations. Again, we hear the eerie discordant sounds (excerpts from ""Lux Aeterna"" by György Ligeti, one of Kubrick's favorite composers). The humans crowd around the strange monolith to take a picture, and although it feels much more civilized, there is an unsettling resemblance to the primitive apes throwing themselves at the earlier monolith, all clawing for their own touch. Just at that moment, a deafening, high-pitched tone pierces the scientists' ears, and this section of the story suddenly concludes.The middle section of the film takes place 18 months later on the ship Discovery, which is bound for Jupiter. The crew includes David Bowman (Keir Dullea), Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood), three other doctors who are in hibernation chambers, and the HAL 9000 computer (voiced by Douglas Rain). HAL is a marvel of modern computer technology. He has a perfect operational record, speaks with seemingly genuine emotion, and acts as another member of the crew. There is a very revealing moment when Bowman discusses his view on whether or not HAL has true emotions.But when something goes wrong with HAL, and Bowman and Poole decide to disconnect him, HAL fights back, and along the way becomes one of the most monstrous villains in film history. We fear HAL so greatly not because he has a booming voice or a cruel heart, but for the exact opposite reason. He speaks quietly and calmly in a detached manner and is merely ensuring that he can do the job he was programmed to do: stay functional and make sure the mission is complete. As a computer, he does not understand the terrible things he is doing, and this makes him all the more terrifying. (It is interesting to note that Anthony Hopkins used HAL as his model when trying to create his interpretation of the cold and monstrous Hannibal Lecter).When Bowman finally gets into the chamber housing the equipment of HAL's central functions, HAL quickly turns from villain to tragic figure. He begs in the same calm voice for Bowman to stop destroying his memory. He says he can ""feel"" his mind going. When Bowman persists, HAL recites one of the most heartbreaking lines in film: ""I'm afraid, Dave."" This sheds a haunting light on the question of HAL's emotional capability.For the sake of preserving novelty, I will not reveal much about the film's final half hour. I will say two things however. One: It represents some of the most brilliant cinema I have ever seen. Two: If you do not read the book, you will be extremely perplexed by what transpires. Suffice it to say that the monolith's role in human evolution is finally brought to the forefront. In addition, the aesthetics and suspense of the last ten minutes are, simply put, beautiful and awe-inspiring.It is hard to imagine any director other than Kubrick at the helm of this project. The misanthropic undercurrents regarding technological innovation reflect upon Kubrick's persistent interest in the dehumanization of society (e.g.--A Clockwork Orange, Dr. Strangelove, Full Metal Jacket). Kubrick's meticulous, deliberate directing caters perfectly to the vast emptiness and solitude of space. His sense of composition provides for striking, often disturbing imagery (consider the sun towering directly over the center of the monolith, or Bowman and Poole conversing on opposite ends of the frame with HAL in the background exactly in the middle of the frame). The visual effects, designed by Kubrick himself, are a testament to how creativity can rise above technological limitation, considering that there was no such thing as digital manipulation.Perhaps the most amazing thing about 2001: A Space Odyssey is that despite the fact that it is almost 35 years old, and despite the fact that its vision of the future was not entirely accurate, it does not seem at all dated. The issues raised in the film are as relevant now as they were then. Certainly, human evolution is an issue that will continue to be debated for many years to come. Due to its unforgettable imagery, its novel use of classical music, and its brilliant conclusion, 2001: A Space Odyssey will not soon be forgotten.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Jarring, Esoteric, Philosophical, Spiritual, Psychedelic, Compulsively slow, Timeless, Ageless.","Jarring, Esoteric, Philosophical, Spiritual, Psychedelic, Compulsively slow, Timeless, Ageless.This cinematic audio visual brilliance is so many things at once and yet it never aspires to be anything. It cannot be (and should not be) typecast into a sci-fi film. This is just a medium that addresses larger questions like : Who am I ? What is the purpose of life ? What is my place in context of the Universe ?The real beauty is that this A/V does not directly raise any such question nor does it explicitly spell out answers. Because there are none. It transmits a telemetric wave that compels you to think. And hopefully, will do so for many years to come.Having said that, this movie can equally raise questions on evolution, technological progress, artificial intelligence, inter-stellar travel, worm-holes, space colonization and many such significant topics but I see them as mere stepping stones.The year in the title of this movie is a misnomer. It never needed it. But i guess that would have just derailed the audience.Personally, I think a movie such as this was directly scripted by the black monolith itself. Only the hand that seemed to wield it was different. It was the need of the hour.Entertainment seekers, look elsewhere. If i could make some cave-men like tribe watch just one movie in their entire lifetime, this would be it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Deserves to be a classic,"This film was groundbreaking when it was released in 1968. I watched it in 2007 and found it to be better in every way-- yes, even special effects-- than most sci fi films coming out today. I plan on watching it on a big screen. The simple fact is that the film is strong in just about every respect.Why do I give this movie a 7 out of 10 instead of a higher rating? Really, it comes down to two main things:1) not every movie can age perfectly. The excessive amount of time given to some of the cheesier elements of the space age technology takes away from this otherwise enjoyable movie. ""Cling shoes"", for example.2) personal preference. I generally prefer dramas, actions, comedies, and thrillers to epics. although i might rate this higher after seeing it on the big screen.So, in summary: It's a classic and deserves to be, but it's not one of my personal favorites.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

We drown in our own pretention,"Kubrick seems to have wanted to make this film a long homage to Frederick Nietzche.  The ""Dawn of Man"" sequence, Dave's release of Frank's corpse and Dave's final transformation into a child are all direct references to that philosopher's Thus Spake Zarathustra, and subtler, more interpretive references abound, including use of a Strauss piece with the same name as that book as the movie's ""theme music.""People do not understand the intellectual content of this film, and I therefore fell very safe in saying that it must've failed to reach its own brainy aims.  All ideas about it ""meaning"" have been pure conjecture, and vague conjecture at that.  Add to that a complete lack of drama, and you have one amazingly bad film",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Amazing atmosphere, cinematography and practical effects","The most amazing, the most awe inducing part of this film, is the fact that it was made in the 60's. The production, the cinematography and the effects are still relevant today. It is the only film which I've given a 10/10, but not only due to the context of it being from the 60's, but also the fact that it is an awe-some film by itself.Watching it, you'd think it'd just be a long drone, as a matter of fact, it is over 2 hours long and the dialogue is minimal. But the atmosphere and scenery makes up for it. When watching this film, I was just astonished, I was so fascinated by the little things, like how people walked on walls or how things were floating - ""How did they do these practical effects in the 60's?"" was a very common thought of mine.The symbolism of this film, the way it shows our development, it's like a journey of the soul.And watching the ending - I didn't even think about the fact that all of that was happening for about 20 minutes - I was just so fascinated. Though this is a classic, though this might be a pioneer in the sci-fi genre, I've found nothing that seemed to even attempt to copy it, as many films often do. I would recommend for people to check out Stanley Kubrick's work, they are very similar in the fact that they're committed to and executed in a very great way.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"OK, almost...","I must say, at first I hated this movie. I didn't understand anything about the end. Then I started seeing it again, and read the book, and finally understood this whole thing.I must say, now that I understand it, it's not a complicated movie. also, it definitely has great effects for 1968. What Tarkoskij said, and I agree with, this movie is a little ""cold"". In the final sequence, I don't feel that much of an emotional journey together with the main carachter, like in other films, e.g. Solaris, Stalker or even Interstellar, inspired by this film. Also there is a loong sequence at half movie that just makes me bored, for some odd reason.What I instead like of this, is the plot, and the cinematic side of it, the solutions adopted to film some scenes. The great synchronism between music and picture, the use of classical music, mixed with gyorgy ligeti's music really makes that side of the thing. Pink Floyd fans like me will like the fact that their song ""echoes"" is perfectly synchronized with the last chapter of the movie, I suggest also to watch that listening simultaneously to the song, it definitely gives a different feeling.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Sci-Fi Masterpiece,"Never before has a film left such an impact on me as 2001:ASO. Let me start off by saying that this is NOT a film that everyone can enjoy. It is often slow at times. Also, there is very little dialogue throughout the movie. This is not a movie centered around specific characters per se, which we are so used to seeing, but rather a movie whose main character is all of us as a species. This is a movie rich with symbolism. The directing is outstanding. Stanley Kubrick's unique style seems to work best in this film. The special effects, while obviously dated, still hold up pretty well to this day. It is amazing to think what was visually accomplished in this movie considering how new space travel was at the time. The score of the film gives the movie such an epic feeling that it'll give you goosebumps. This film also has, in my opinion, the greatest ending to a film that I have ever seen. It'll make you think and puts the whole film into perspective. All in all, this film is really unlike anything I've ever seen before. I don't very often give a movie a 10, but I feel that this movie is deserving of it. I highly recommend this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A mind numbing journey into past and future,"I first experienced Stanley Kubrik's movie masterpiece during opening week at a movie theatre in Toronto at age seven. I have watched the movie at least 100 times over the past few decades and it constantly evolves evokes new meaning upon each viewing. The movie spans the history of mankind's time on Earth and hints that we are from ""elsewhere"" other than our own planet. Kubrik pioneered film techniques that were copied by countless producers in later years, however, the silent sequences in outer space (along with the pronounced breathing from the astronauts themselves) is haunting and unforgettable. An absolutely stunning and thought provoking film that leaves you thinking about the past, present and future.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An of its time classic,"I am not going to attempt to provide a full review of this classic film. To do so would be futile as the chances are if you are reading this you will have a) seen the film already or b) as a fan of film/TV be so familiar with the key scenes and themes (as I was) that I cannot add anything that you do not already know.My thoughts will be limited to what I liked and the issues I have that stop this scoring higher.The positives for me were how good the film looks for something made in 1968. Yes, there are a few scenes that are clearly influenced by 60's fashion but the past and future sets on the whole have a timeless quality. The use of music and the ballerina like atmosphere were things of beauty and proof that Kubrick really was a genius (Eyes Wide Shut aside). I think the best praise for these scenes is that they influenced a generation of makers of sci fi and fans of such (Star Wars being the obvious one but my personal favourite is the influence over Red Dwarf!!). They are iconic and deserve to be as for the time this was something mind boggling.The lack of dialogue is a little disconcerting at first but as the film develops it becomes apparent that this helps the film. It creates an atmosphere within which the stunning set pieces can stand out and which allows Kubricks direction to shine. Actions speak louder than words, as evinced in the closing act where, at least from a human point of view, there is little to no spoken word.For me the film falls down on two points. The first is the run time. It is just too long to keep the concentration, especially when there are large gaps where not a great deal is happening. All the beautiful shots in the world will not make up for the fact that a full 15 minutes has gone since something that drove the story along happened. Secondly, and my main gripe, is that at times this film seems to be more about showing off than it is about telling a story. I want to be entertained felt that too much time was being taken to show how great the technology was and how clever the directors/producers/set designers were. A prime example is the second section where the chap is heading for the moon. We have two dance sequences and numerous scenes of zero gravity and ""look how futuristic this all is"". As viewers we accept it is the future and do not need it shoving down our throats. Establish it, show us a little bit of how they live and move on.I am certain that having taken 33 years of my life to watch this film it will be something I revisit in the future. Maybe my thoughts will change but I doubt it - this is a very impressively made film with some great moments and a very solid and entertaining third act but sadly it falls short of classic status due to being overblown and far too clever for its own good.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Must-see movie,"I really enjoy this movie - it may look slightly dated by today's standards, but remember this was made in 1968 and was ahead of its time back then. The soundtrack is haunting and extremely beautiful. Whilst I am certainly no expert in this genre or field, it leaves you with the impression that you are watching something very worthwhile and potentially life changing. Each time I watch it I get something more from it. The stunning cinematography during the last thirty minutes was the finest from the 60's - and possibly even the 70's! For me the movie promotes a desire to gain more knowledge. I would love to see it in I-Max very late at night. If the evolutionary path excites you, then it is a very worthwhile movie!!! Love it!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Could be Better...,"Since this is an all-time classic, and rated on the top ten best movies in the whole world, I just had too watch it. After seeing this, I could understand why people loved it so much. Personally I'm not a big fan, but it had that good moments were I felt the action was banger! The film goes very slow, something that isn't so popular in movies these days. Well, personally, I didn't like it so much. I can watch movies were the action has a slow built-up, but this crossed the line. I can understand if a few scenes could have the slow movements and music, but that kind of scenes went almost throughout the whole film. Like every ten minutes we got something like that. A few of this slow scenes were interesting, in terms of making the dynamic and atmosphere of space. Kubrick thought smart to mute the sound in space, because in reality, there isn't any sound in space. So yeah, that gave sense. The music soundtrack was good to and did fit most of the time. When we got into action (That personally wasn't that original, yet holding) then it was more interesting. A crew is on a journey to Jupiter, while they discover that their artificial intelligence on the ship can't be trusted. This showed greatly how robots and Ai can betray us if something goes wrong, that we can never be sure, never have the full trust. Hal (The Ai on the ship) was a good part of the film that made the characters and the story more interesting, compared to other boring parts of the film. The human characters (like for example the guy called Dave) were good enough to hold the story in one place, and the acting was decent. I can mention right away the opening scene with the monkeys, when the story focused on the pre-historic part of earth, when humans weren't evolved yet. That felt like som BBC David Attenborough special and didn't felt that cinematic. Something I noticed was a reference, though. I watched the Barbie movie some months ago and I saw that they copied the scene from the Space Odyssey. Watch the both movies and then you will see, I don't want to spoil too much. The technical parts were interesting, the scenography was probably one of the best parts of the film, yet I have seen much better in other science fiction movies. As I mentioned, the music was nice, the sound was good, too, but if I conclude everything, I can still say that this wasn't my movie. Many good parts, but I wasn't that impressed. Some people may like it much more than me, and well, good for them. I definitely prefer other movies from the science fiction genre.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""Open the Pod Bay doors, Hal"".","""2001: A Space Odyssey"" was always going to be a classic, even if you factor out its considerable quality. Whether you think it's a better Movie than most is irrelevant; rather, it's a different way of creating a Movie. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" justifies its formidable reputation on originality alone. You think that the journey to Jupiter goes on for too long? Name a Movie that would dare to even attempt it! Mr. Stanley Kubrick creates an entirely new field of Film, and no-one else has even managed to enter it yet, forget toppling ""2001..."" from its perch. Though the HAL episode and the fancy Space-Age Gizmos lend the Film a primal appeal, ""2001..."" is at heart a very deep Movie. It raises all manner of questions that unspoken moral codes dictate shouldn't be raised in Movies. I'm convinced that it would be a lifetime's work to read into every aspect of ""2001..."", and it makes me wonder: could a human really get this much depth into a plot? Was it just luck, endless profundity borne out of spontaneous creation? Or did Kubrick thoroughly, meticulously, Religiously plunder every depth, develop every point, craft each and every aspect of this Film to levels of transcendentalism that would make a Philosopher blush? Frankly, Kubrick's notoriety makes the latter quite plausible.But I digress. I'm going off on a tangent, tripping over myself to praise this Film, and that does it no justice. As I tried to show, it's perfectly crafted, honed down to utmost perfection, in itself. With such perfectionism readily available in store, online, anywhere, why read a review?

Hugely influential sci fi masterpiece,"I first saw this film on t.v. one evening when I was around 8 years old, I didn't like it, I wanted action and scary aliens and bad ass robots rather than just a boring computer 'Voice'!

I finally got it, I finally understood why it avoids sci fi cliches.
Despite it being one of my favourite films I do understand why it is regarded as boring with nothing really happening, it's a film you have to watch while being on the right wavelength for it.
It's the concepts and hypnotic atmosphere that make it a truly great film, rather than action etc.
When I'm on the right wavelength I am transported to the 'infinite and beyond' , and because nothing is explained it leaves me spellbound until at the end of the film I snap back into the 'here and now' and I think to myself... 'WOW!! that really is one of the greatest films ever made' !

"It just didn't entice me, that's all. I can still respect it.","Pleasing on a technical level, even with barely anything to grasp story-wise.'2001: A Space Odyssey' looks and sounds exquisite, it really is seriously impressive in that regard for a film from 1968. That is, however, the only reason that this gets a passing rating from me if I'm to be totally truthful. The plot itself is rather disappointing, with not much meat on the bones.I get it's evidently going for the more artsy approach, made clear by the lack of dialogue/bona fide narrative alongside plenty of ambiguity. It's a Stanley Kubrick film after all, not that I've seen much of his work (this be the first, in fact); moreso what I've heard through the grapevine down the years. There are also a lot of long held, empty-feeling (as intended, I'd imagine) shots that bothered me throughout. It just didn't entice me, that's all. I can still respect it.Given the aforementioned, the cast are basically nonentities - as harsh as that may sound. Douglas Rain does a good job, in fairness, and William Sylvester is alright. I can't say I blame those onscreen all that much, as they aren't exactly given much opportunity to showcase themselves.As has been the case with a couple of other movies down the years, I'm certainly content to file this one with the 'I clearly didn't get it and I'm cool with that' tag.

The magnum opus of a legendary director.,"It's hard to think of something to say about '2001' that hasn't already been said, attacked with a counterargument, and subsequently divided opinion. When I finished watching this film a few days ago I decided to see what the IMDb reviewers thought of it, and, unsurprisingly, opinion was split between those who hailed it as a masterpiece worthy of consideration alongside 'Citizen Kane' and 'Gone with the Wind', and those who thought that it was a disastrous, pretentious wreck. Although I was somewhat sceptical at certain points in the film (particularly the lengthy silent moments), I have to plant my feet alongside the crowd who praise Kubrick's genius in making '2001'. This title is more a sensory experience than a movie, and so it's tremendously difficult to convey what you should expect; but, at some point throughout the film, something will click into place. That sounds horribly vague, but I can't help but compare it to one of those computer-based optical illusions which instruct the reader to ""stare at 'x' and within 30 seconds you'll see 'y'."" This film conveys its themes and philosophy in an abstract but not incomprehensible way, and although it may slot into the 'sci-fi' category, it's much more than that. When it comes to Stanley Kubrick films, I think I'll always hold 'A Clockwork Orange' in the highest regard due to its style and excellent lead, but I really believe that '2001' is the director's magnum opus.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spectacular,"There is nothing like it and there probably never will be. Watching 2001: A Space Odyssey makes it difficult to determine whether Kubrick is mad or a genius. Perhaps he's both. Nothing is obvious in this film, yet it feels easy to understand.The fact that there is a Wikipedia page for interpretations of this film speaks volumes about the reactions that people have had to it. Do I understand what all of it means? No, absolutely not, and I probably never will. But that's the beauty of it. We can all find our own meaning in it. Even if it's a completely different one.
I think that the film discusses both our ingenuity and lack of it as a species. If it weren't for the monolith, perhaps we would still be apes? If it weren't for the monolith on the moon, perhaps that's as far as we ever would've travelled. As such, although the human race is special in many ways, it also needs help and it needs to be pushed.Since there is absolutely nothing that hasn't already been said about this film, I'll just mention some of the things that struck me the most.
First, the way that this film looks. It is quite remarkable how incredible this movie looks even now in 2020. It could've been filmed this year and I wouldn't have known the difference if it weren't for the obviously outdated machines.
Second, the way it's filmed. Some scenes are excruciatingly slow. Yet therein lies their beauty. You have so much time to just take it all in that it ends up becoming quite overwhelming. Newer movies guide you from start to finish. Whereas Kubrick allows you to watch whatever you want without having to fear missing something.
Third, those scenes with nothing but Dr Bowman's breath as the audio. It created a sense of claustrophobia. I felt like I was inside the helmet and I'm not sure that I wanted to be there. Add the fact that there was no music and you have quite an eery atmosphere.The quote that I selected at the beginning, describes this movie in a weird way. Isn't that exactly what the monoliths are trying to do? To get us to be at our fullest possible use. That's at least how I saw and felt it. Then again, I don't think that there is a clear explanation for this movie, at least not one as simple as that.
As I said, this movie is either mad or genius. In all likelihood, it's probably both. I'm not sure that I will ever truly understand 2001: A Space Odyssey, but then again, that's what makes it so special.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Very good but over-rated, read on!","Very good movie, some really interesting and thought provoking parts, but overall not amazing, like some poeple think. I'm not one of those 'brought up on MTV' people who can't stay focused for more then 15 seconds without an explosion. I enjoyed this movie and found it thought provoking but too drawn out. Some of Kubricks other movies, clockwork orange as my favorite, are also well directed and much more interesting. In Kubrick's defense, I can see that the effects in the movie, in '68, were likely awe inspiring but in time have unfortunately lost much of their splendor. Also, im sure many of you who do love this movie love it legitimately and everyone has and is entitled to their own opinion, some of the movies I love are not appreciated by many people, but I beleive that alot of people just say they love this movie so that they can seem more intelligent then the average movie viewer, who doesn't understand this movie. This can be seen in the similarity of most of the positive reviews for this movie. In conclusion, it is a good movie, but it is over-rated.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Why I became a scientist after watching 2001 Space Odyssey.  It was that black screen as the film began to roll!,"I remember sitting in the movie theatre back in 1968 as a young teen watching the black screen appear at the beginning of 2001; A Space Odyssey while transcendent music/vocals played, curious as to whether the absence of a visual cue was a technical failure or intentional? At the time, I failed to envision that the theatre viewing screen was proportionally the same length and width as the black monolith per Arthur C. Clark's expansive novel. Maybe its common lore, but it only just struck me last week, while I was watching 2001: A Space Odyssey on my own widescreen TV for the unknown'th time, that Stanley Kubrick was having his way with us during the Prelude. It is easy to envisage that we, the audience, were being ""educated"" by the black monolith before us as represented by the seemingly void, imageless screen. While some critics in 1968 panned the movie (Village Voice, NYT) others, and many still do today, and described it as boring and unimaginative, in fact Kubrick's juxtaposition of the laughably mundane and tedious daily life of an influental space traveller against most extraordinary cosmic events makes it a stunning achievement in science fiction moviedom that may never be repeated. In this matter, George Lucas has stated that it remains the Holy Grail of science fiction films. After all these years, 2001; A Space Odyssey still showcases Stanley Kubrick's most incredible ingenuity, imagination, and style in interpreting Aurthur C. Clarke's engrossing ideas. And he had his way with us a little bit too! The fact that 2001 came and went doesn't dampen my enthusiasm; every time I watch 2001; A Space Odyssey I am still back in that theatre in 1968 full of wonder at Kubrick's masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Masterpiece-of-crap,"2001: A Space Odyssey, was without a doubt, the lamest, most boring, most unentertaining, poor excuse for a film, waste of time, I've ever seen! Whenever there was any form of live action, there was absolute silence. Whenever there was nothing to see but black, it was accompanied by the most horrible set of minor and dimished chords you could imagine. It was a waste of 2 and a half hours. I constantly kept repeating, ""THE END"" hoping that the film would heed my request. I don't see how it can be called a masterpiece. It was nothing but a series of segways from one scene to the next, with each segway getting longer and each scene getting shorter. The most excruciating scene had to be when the ship was entering Jupiter's orbit. A 15 minute sequence with simple images slowly flashing on the screen after being run through a filter. The music sounded as if a three year old had been sat behind a piano and been allowed to bang on the keys. Coming in at a close second, was the first 20 minutes in which nothing happened except two clans of monkeys fought, after it took one of them 19 minutes to realize that a bone could be used as a beating device. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!THE WORST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A true cinematic experience,"This is one of the films that made me a cinephile. In fact, the cinematic experience engages the viewer in such an amazing experience, through time, space and the mysteries of mind, ""2001 - A Space Odyssey"" helped me decide my professional career. I can say I am a producer because I once fell in love with this master piece. Stanley Kubrick was an obsessive creator. He was able to build a solid career not only experimenting, but mainly mastering the grammar of film genres. It would not be absurd to say he made one of the best scifi films ever, ""2001 - A Space Odyssey"", one of the best historical films ever, ""Barry Lyndon"", one of the best war films ever, ""Full Metal Jacket"", one of the best suspense/horror films ever, ""The Shining"".

The movie (1968) was filmed in conjunction with the writing of the book.,"Sometimes an existing book is converted into a movie, and they usually get away with saying ""based on"" so they can do everything from abbreviating the story to downright telling a different story but using the same name.Other books are written after the movie. This can sometimes clarify what you watched. Of course, that depends on what clarifying is. The book ""Forbidden Planet"" by W. J. Stuart is a good example.This movie ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" was created parallel with the book, and each gave feedback to the other during their production. Be sure to read the forward in the book which tells the differences and why.The story gets a little wordy in its descriptions but at least you will know what you are looking at in the movie from this description. Whereas the movie relies on visuals and a rather good soundtrack ""Thus spoke Zarathustra."" They had planned for original music but this is much better.I liked the space station design better that that clunky outdated thing we call a space station.It is hard to describe the plot without spoilers, however, what if we were engineered to survive?

"Visually rich, confusing as all get out, but I do agree it's important","I've watched this for the first time as of right now and I can say this. It's one of the most visually stunning films I've ever seen. So many films that have since been highly acclaimed for their visual splendor simply cannot hold a candle to this one in that respect. And the film does tackle the theme of man v. artificial intelligence in a gripping way. I only wish the storytelling could match Kubrick's flare for visuals in this film. Ironically, some films that have paid homage to this one have in some ways done a better job with the material.Unfortunately, the film's rather sluggish pacing is something of a debit. Even its most diehard fans have to admit, it's a film that occasionally moves at a glacial pace. And the final turn of events can be charitably described as inconclusive. Whatever Kubrick was aiming for with this ending, he only succeeded in creating a precedent that many filmmakers have since followed whenever they find a straightforward, coherent ending to be inconvenient or too easy.As easy as it is to knock this film not quite living up to the near universal praise it gets, one still has to acknowledge how influential it has been. It's worth seeing for that reason alone, even though the debate over where in the hierarchy of Kubrick films the one falls will likely continue until the end of time.

2001: Truly an Odyssey,"2001: A Space Odyssey is no more a film than I a potato. And, while the limits of my physical comprehension prevent me from truly knowing otherwise, I am not a potato. Rather than being a film, 2001 is a thrillingly ambitious visual journey that transcends time and space, bringing forth puzzling, yet provocative ideas of the beauty and horror in mankind's quest to further itself as a species. It is an experience that refuses to spoon-feed its themes, opening the intellectual playing field for multiple interpretations, creating a swarm of controversy and argument as each individual seeks to piece together the subtle and not-so-subtle hints at what in the world 2001 is saying. And if that weren't enough, it is thrilling, beautifully paced, and visually stunning for a film (for lack of a better word) made in the 1960s.2001 begins, rather curiously, at the ""dawn of man"". Men in monkey suits roam the desolate plains of Africa (I assume that it is Africa due to the general consensus that mankind originated in Africa). I must say, that even for men in monkey suits, they were quite convincing as actual monkeys. Hilarious, even. But that's besides the point. The ""dawn of man"" sequence is done to show the dawn of human ingenuity, and how this newfound ability to use elements in our environment to our own personal use put us at the top of the evolutionary pyramid. It also suggests at some divine intervention, with the appearance of a large, black, rectangular block that seems to create the ingenuity within humanity.Flash forward many, many years, and mankind has colonized the moon. A doctor of some sort is heading to the moon to retrieve an artifact. A brilliant docking sequence ensues, as spaceships float towards and around each other, provocatively shadowed, while a familiar classical waltz highlights the dance-like quality of the whole scene. It is slightly overextended, I admit, but I suppose that this was done for the benefit of the 60s audience, who had likely seen nothing even close to the likes of this film's visuals before. The doctor lands on the moon, and heads to the artifact, whatever it is. I will not reveal what this artifact is (although I'm sure that pretty much everyone knows), but whatever it is sparks a mission to Jupiter eighteen months later, manned by two men in charge of the maintenance of the ship, a few members of the survey team who are in cryostasis, and the sentient computer HAL 9000, who controls most of the ship. This sequence resorts to a conventional narrative that is significantly faster paced and more atmospheric than the other sections of 2001. What basically happens is this: HAL makes a mistake, and everything goes downhill from there.The thing I liked most about this sequence is the acting. In this day and age, our cinematic characters feel deliberately scripted, while in 2001, the dialogue feels real, complete with ""ums"", verbal mistakes, and real emotion. The actors feel like real people, and we are thus able to sympathize with all of them, even including HAL.And then the film ends. And what an ending it is. It is an ending that will fuel controversy for years to come, as it is so frustratingly complicated and ambiguous, that it can be interpreted in any number of ways. Some may toss it off as pretentious (which is valid), while others may devote their waking hours to unceasing analysis. Interstellar, in an obvious attempt to rip-off 2001's shocking ending, took a shot at it, but just ended up drowning in ridiculous pseudoscience. 2001 doesn't pretend to be bound by the realm of science. Its thought-provoking climax, unlike Interstellar's, is a purely transcendental experience that appeals to our imagination as well as our intellect. Although the bit before the final sequence is ridiculously and annoyingly over extended, this is only a small issue compared to the beauty of the final sequence.I loved this movie, because it forced me to think, not just sit and drool. We have become so used to being served up ideas (or passive entertainment) on a platter, that we forget our own intelligence, becoming one with the ideas of the filmmaker rather than creating our own.Although you may condemn Kubrick as a pretentious showman, keep in mind that he can do more with a large, black, rectangular block than most contemporary directors can do with mountains of CGI, and that is what makes him one of the greats. Let me put it this way: If all films were potatoes, 2001 would be a film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
For its time...,"Older movies are always so overrated in my opinion. This probably was great for its time, but a modern movie like Interstellar is this movie times 10.

The other half is a short story about an object and a trip to Jupiter. Yet it's somehow over 2 hours long.

I understand that it was ahead of its time in filmmaking and paved the way for other space films such as Interstellar etc. But I was not a fan. I will give the film some credit, given the 4/10 instead of maybe a 2/10. If you read deep into the film, then you can kind of draw your own conclusions, but not me.

The original interstellar space film,"I am honestly lost for words. This could be one of the best, most groundbreaking, most mind boggling movie ever made. It is perfection down to the molecular level, yet I have not the slightest clue what it is about. Which is the brilliance of it, that it becomes whatever the viewer wants it to be.This movie is definitely an experience for used film watchers. Someone who doesn't have passion for films, could leave the theatre extremely disappointed and confused, because for them, the story and events must be clearly projected. If you do however, enjoy movies and their complexity, this will leave you mind blown.For starters, it doesn't need saying, but Kubrick is as always shining in direction and cinematography. He is in complete control over the cameras and knows exactly what he wants them to show. The long-spun still shots to grand views of grand areas. Most of them might seem confusing to the common viewer, but to the trained eye, you can see that every single shot is of significance and not one minute of film is wasted. This is the excellence of the marvellous Stanley Kubrick, his strive for perfection. All of this in combination with the music, makes for a movie in a class of its own. It has one of the most complete scores of any movie I've ever seen. It's breathtakingly haunting and immensely colossal. It emphasises the greatness of this movie incredibly.But the most astonishing thing about it is that it isn't obvious or simple, but extremely complexed. And in Kubrick's own words when asked about the meaning behind the film: ""They are the areas I prefer not to discuss because they are highly subjective and will differ from viewer to viewer"". It becomes whatever the viewer perceives it to be. It is a massive interstellar movie, a first of its kind, with special effects that has aged extremely well.

Then my eyelids opened and closed stunned disbelief to the fact that Kubrick also he were under the influence of the mysterious monolith.

Space Odyssey - A state-of-the-art sci-fi film well ahead of its time (1968),"Space Odyssey is a state-of-the-art Sci-fi movie in terms of technological ideas it exhibited – which was truly first-of-its-kind way back in 1968 when it was released.It seems Space Odyssey was thought of by Stanley Kubrick just to showcase those technological ideas – without any proper sci-fi story.The movie looks very ""experimental"" in nature.The importance of Stanley Kubrick can be gauged from the fact that Steven Spielberg considers him to be the Big Bang of Science-Fiction movies. And that's 100% true!

More interestingly, the sofas have display screens at the back. I do not think anyone at that time (1968) were using such hi-tech sofas in real life.6 – The film showcased visual effects & sound effects well ahead of its time.7 – Space Odyssey has a signature tune that is world famous and has been used around the world in TV shows.DEMERITS of Space Odyssey (but this does not mean you should not watch this path-breaking film)1 – It is a slow-moving movie and does not have any ""action"" at all.2 – The ending is BIZARRE – and incomprehensible!Finally, believe it or not but Space Odyssey is a must watch film before you die!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

2001: A Space Odyssey: potentially one of the greatest cinema  experiences you will ever have,"2001: A Space Odyssey, directed by Stanley Kubrick, is widely regarded as one of the greatest science fiction films ever created. 2 years ago, during my first viewing, I was dumbstruck by the idea. Here was a movie with little to no dialogue, shrouded in ambiguity and pacing comparable to watching grass grow. Having watched the film again, I can say that all of these comments still hold true. However, I can now say that these aspects of the film, and many more, are what in fact make this such a rewarding viewing. This is not just a film, but so much more. This is Kubrick's meticulously crafted work of art.So many movies rely on what they have to say in order to create the most effective and fulfilling experience for the audience. 2001 is the complete opposite, it's what isn't said that's the key. Kubrick's use of visuals and music to evoke desired feelings is a rare gift very few filmmakers are capable of. In his long docking shots, he uses just the right score to demonstrate its elegance like a slow, graceful dance. During times when the astronauts are outside in space, all we can hear is the sounds of their muffled heavy breathing, emphasizing man's vulnerability and creating a tense atmosphere where anything can go wrong at any moment. Using silence to create tension is also a very difficult task, but Kubrick's camera techniques and sudden cuts in the score make them equally spine tingling as the best of the thriller genre.The movie is broken down into 3 parts, each shedding light on man's slow evolution from mastering themselves, to mastering the earth, and finally, mastering space and beyond. While there can really be no concrete explanation for the events on screen, the visual splendour, juxtapositions, and symbolism paint a picture that can leave our imaginations running wild, while not being too confusing and bizarre.For those drawn to ambitious sci-fi films such as this, I would first recommend reading the novel in order to avoid being lost the entire time. The novel and movie couple well together since the movie provides the visual, musical and thematic experience while the book can provide very helpful explanations on plot points otherwise not mentioned.In the current movie industry, where big, loud blockbusters, sequels and remakes are dominant, films like 2001: A Space Odyssey demonstrate exactly what most of the new releases are lacking: originality, elegance, and boundary pushing film techniques. Stanley Kubrick attempted this in almost every film he created, with 2001 being his crowning achievement.FINAL VERDICT: While undeniably not for everyone, those that can appreciate a visually thrilling, beautifully scored and radically ambitious film will find 2001: A Space Odyssey to be one of the single greatest cinematic experiences of their lifetime.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A 1968 sci-fi film???!!!,"Rating is 9.5/10
Watched on May 1st 2024 (First watch)
Format: regular theatreWatching this for the first time IN theaters, will forever be the best cinema experiences I have ever had. I will forever be in a state of shock of what this film was capable of creating and presenting especially that it was made in the 1960s. A film that is so ahead if its time and touches on many topics that our world suffers from nowadays, like Artificial Intelligence. If this film is still impressive nowadays, then Imagine how impressive it was in the 1968??!2001: A Space Odyssey builds its story using a very slow pace to deliver all the different themes and emotions that it's trying to present that might leave many people to be bored because it has less dialogues and relies more on the visuals, so it might seem like this film does not have a story.The film is simply a combination of sci-fi and horror using a simple red dot and a struggling protagonist. The film creatively uses the color red, combined with a single dot and the scary deep voice of Douglas Rain to present the villein of this film that messes up the whole mission which is HAL 9000, the Artificial Intelligence device. This scary design simply provokes a sense of fear, fright, and pessimistic for both mankind's future (that we are in right now with AI being everywhere) and to the protagonists of the film.Almost every single shot in this film is visually stunning and has an astonishing color palette design. Like, the constant use of the color red to indicate danger, the color white to represent peace and calmness that the otter space provides, and the color black that captures the vagueness of outer space. And of course this beauty that the cinematography captures, wouldn't have been possible without the production design that was made with much details to reflect on the futuristic world that the story is set in. The red chairs that are placed in a white space in the Hilton Space Lobby that was shown in the beginning of the film just shows how everything blends in smoothly to create something that is visually stunning. All of this is captured through different angles and camera lenses like the 'fisheye lenses' that capture the point of the view of the evil red Artificial Intelligence dot as if we are the AI device that is stalking the two astronauts.The very loud sound effects that adds on to the elements of the film and tries to provoke a sense of different meanings like the loud and consist heavy breathing of the protagonist that gives a sense of nervousness and uncomfortable. Or the different sudden loud noises that pop-up through out the film that just makes the watching experience more realistic as if we are in the protagonist's shoes.Perhaps the acting is the only thing that I truly didn't feel like it had a big impact on the film, as at times it felt like any other actor could've done what Keir Dullea did. Perhaps that's because they barely had any dialogues to begin with, therefore there was no time for their acting skills to shine. But, Keir Dullea was still able to portray the loneliness, confusion, and scariness of the protagonist who's lonely in otter space and is stuck with an evil AI device.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Read the Book, Watch the Movie","Normally reading a book before seeing a movie is a seriously bad idea as the movie fails to live up to everything that ends up being left out due to edits as part of the adaptation process.

For example, just what is happening with the cavemen and the earth based monolith? Is this typical behavior or is something even more happening?Having watched the movie multiple times prior to reading the book I was shocked at the nuances I had missed.

Watch this movie!!,The movie's title is a perfect description of what this film is when the credits roll you genuinely feel like you just got back from a voyage that left to answer the questions of the universe this film was made a few years before a new hope and still somehow looks more breathtaking than the remastered versions of all three of the original Star Wars movies and I think that is all because of how meticulous Kubrick is with the camera he truly has the eye of renaissance painter in a interview Kubrick stated he wanted the viewer to leave the film with an experience of just coming back from exploring the subconscious and he wanted the viewer to have the same experience we do when we listen to classical music we all have different emotions when we listen to such pieces so he relies on imagery more instead of using a traditional narrative to plot his movie so if by the end of the movie you feel lost don't worry you're not alone or if you find you don't have the seem theories as other people do online that's ok too there is no wrong answer in defining what this movie is about it was designed to give each viewer there own unique thought provoking journey.,9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Portentous, Pretentious, Prescient sci-fi movie, foregrounds themes over character","According to some, this is THE greatest science fiction cinema of all time - and frankly, if you don't like science fiction, you might like this movie anyway since it isn't really science fiction.Arthur C Clarke and Stanley Kubricks story is more of a naval gazing, beard stroking summation of evolution, the quest for spiritual and physical transcendence, and a mystified, though emotionally effecting exploration of intelligible sources of 'higher power', or cosmic intelligence in the universe. According to the writers of 2001: A Space Odyssey, that source has been there since the cradle of civilization, transmitting messages that are, to us, signposts of evolutionary development; shown in the opening sequences of the film as the first instance of primitive tool use among our ancestors.Needless to say, a major studio film as abstract, vastly ambitious, and frequently empty as 2001 could only be a product of the 60's era pseudo-spirituality. Also, the movies advanced concept of sci-fi production design was hugely influential on decades of sci-fi film, television and fantasy art, but aside from that, the actual ""science"" part of the story is boringly slow, features no remarkable human actors and doesn't really engage the audience with the promise suggested in the powerful opening sequences.It appears, in addition to the massive ""super-theme"" (read: sci-fi influenced religious narrative), that Arthur C Clarke and his equally bespectacled co-writer Kubrick include a secondary story about the possibility of highly advanced, seemingly self aware computers, that communicate with the human characters in the ""story"" while carrying out technical mission assistance during space travel.The movie is VERY slow, and it reverberates with the viewer afterward, as it shows a link between our largely geometric, four sided culture and intellectual advancement and the involvement of a powerful, though not entirely comprehensible alien force over the millenia. A fascinating theme, and a very well made film for its time, though basically so cold, ambiguous and leaden-paced that it feels like a task actually getting through. You could add at this point that the merit of a film is maybe not its entertainment value, but its commitment to realism, the intelligence of its themes and its sheer innovation (the film was staggeringly made back in 1967, looks decades ahead of time in terms of believable technology etc). This might be why critics make such elevated claims about the film. Basically, if you've ever wondered about intelligible life hundreds of millions of light years from our planet (everybody has), then this film deals with that subject, though in a way that treats the subject with consideration and depth that was unusual for science fiction cinema of its day.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Can I extract the middle?,"""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is a cinematic wonder. I'm not old enough to have seen this movie in theaters but I have availed myself of many films from the 50's and 60's and this movie just shattered barriers. It is light years ahead of anything at that time. It was light on dialog but what it eschewed of dialog it compensated with visual stimuli. There wasn't a single word uttered for the first 30 minutes nor the last 30 minutes thereby leaving a lot open for interpretation. I can't say that I was a fan of the two extremes of the film but I loved the middle. That's not to say I was looking for a plot to be spoon fed to me, it's just that some artsy filmography I like and some I don't. The middle of the film however--dealing with A.I. in the early days before we referred to it as A.I.--was groundbreaking, trendsetting, and astounding.

Believe the Hype,"Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey has always been a polarizing film. I can't think of a movie that is both greatly acclaimed and despised at the same time. Of course, generally speaking, most people love it in some way. The biggest complaint I see is that many people find it boring. And hey, that's how they feel and I won't judge them. But I was never bored. Even during some especially long sequences with no dialogue or sound effects, I was always focused. Maybe it's the inherit beauty of the effects and camera work that keeps me enthralled throughout.Needless to say, it's not for everyone. Which I really hate to say since it's such an amazing movie. Absolutely in the top ten best ever. Never have I been so confused by a movie but still loving it. But I think it was a good confusion, like the kind you feel while watching a twisty mystery. You think you expect what will happen, and then it does not. The special effects might be the best ever put on film. It's amazing how accurate Kubrick got space travel. I don't like to use the term auteur. It's overused and wrong since movies are such a collaborative effort. But if any director deserves that title it's Kubrick. And he earns it with this film. The classical music soundtrack is glorious and the amount of risks this movie takes is insane. This isn't your average sci-fi movie. It's grounded in some form of reality, even thought it has a fantastical concept.Don't expect any straight answers from this movie. You won't get them. And that's okay. Not everything has to be laid out perfectly in front of us. That's part of the wonder of this timeless classic. Every time you see it, it's like a different experience. I feel if people have the proper context and a basic idea of what to expect, they will enjoy it more. Yes, it's long, and slowly paced, and a challenge for some viewers. But for those who want to see some brilliant and creative cinema with some patience to boot, you can't go wrong 2001.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"It's an influential movie, but it's got its flaws.","2001: A Space Odyssey is worth seeing, because you'll understand references and be able to make conversation about it.  However, you might not enjoy watching it.  There were a few things I really liked about it, but I wouldn't say that I had a good time watching the film.That's not to say that I particularly regret spending the time (it is a bit lengthy) to watch it.  Afterwards it is interesting to mull over some of the themes, and develop your own take on it.  I won't be so pompous as to try to feed you my interpretation of the meaning, because there are too many ways you could explain each thing.  However, as vague as the metaphors are, I feel that Kubrick beats the viewer over the head with them.  The phallic object(s), the question of whether or not man is special, ""man's first instinct,"" and so on: I don't know about everyone else, but I felt like Kubrick tried a bit too hard to make his themes clear.  I didn't know anything about the film beforehand, so I wasn't primed to come in and analyze everything.  However, when the message and substance are so blatant (even if you can't be sure quite what they are), you are forced to self-consciously think about the movie while watching it.  ""Ugh, I've been watching birth imagery for the last five minutes,"" you think, and it detracts from the experience.  Even if you realize you might be wrong.The themes are certainly interesting questions, interesting things to think about.  And I'm not saying that they're presented in a shock-value sort of way.  Without dialogue, action, and dynamic camera work, though, when the artistic parts come up and come on so strong, it's just overkill.  The ending sequence is particularly guilty of this.  Everything is metaphor, and Kubrick chose some rather mundane ways to represent the grandiose, almost as if he thinks no one will have any clue what's going on otherwise.  ""Oh, come on, a bathtub?"" you may find yourself griping.As for the claims that the movie is boring, they may go a bit too far, but there is some validity to them.  Certainly some scenes are most effective when they're stretched out longer than you'd expect.  At least for me, Kubrick stretched them out far longer than was necessary.  Given the flavor of the film, long sit-back-and-enjoy-the-beauty scenes seem out of place while you're trying to discover out what's going on, and they end long after you've taken it all in.In all, if you enjoy your thought-provoking experiences coming in story form, you'll be disappointed.  If you like to change how you view the world slowly, and don't take well to things that try to blow your mind, you'll be disappointed.  If you're not interested in an experiment in film pace, you'll be disappointed.  If you'd rather have fun watching a movie, and do the deep thinking later, you'll be disappointed.  See the movie I suppose, but there will be many things that will make you want to roll your eyes.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The 2014 Restored Version - the quality is there if you can view it properly.,"Sadly, I am old enough to remember seeing 2001 when it first came out. I saw it in a London West End cinema in it's full 70mm glory on a huge screen. The sound was amazing - huge full-range speakers. A mind blowing experience. Then I heard that a newly restored version was coming to cinemas. So, last night I went to the Picturehouse Harbour Lights cinema in Southampton UK to regain the wonder of this film. I've seen quite a few restored/remastered films and have been amazed by the way some very skilled people have made them better than new. By scanning from the camera negatives, all the losses we used to get from inter-negs and release prints disappear and we are left with amazing clarity and colour fidelity. And, sound restoration can produce stunning sound. So, you can imagine the anticipation as I joined the audience - positioning myself in the best viewing seats.The disappointment set in at the very beginning as the thunderous Also Sprach Zarathustra welled-up. What I actually heard was a harsh muddy sound almost as though it had come from the ceiling speakers you get in department stored. The opening of the film is a ""blank"" screen but the blank screen had a small but worrying orange blur on each side of the screen. Once we got into the guts of the film, it became apparent to me that we were not looking at a painstakingly re-mastered digital version from the 65mm camera negative so lovingly shot by Geoffrey Unsworth but at what looked like a 35mm inter-negative or even a print. Definition was poor, colours were blotchy and uneven, and there was even a side-to-side wobble on the live action scenes - and that is unforgivable.At this point, I should say that I was professionally involved in some film restoration a couple of years ago, so you could say I was being over-critical, but I don't think so. I carried on watching the film finding myself becoming more and more disappointed. 2001 is an amazing film, but watching it in such poor image and sound quality was a great disappointment. Perhaps you need to see it on a huge screen with a huge sound system, but until it is properly restored, I would not risk it.I left at the interval.Added after re-viewing...........Having been very negative about the restored version of 2001 that I saw at a local cinema, I now want to add something to that review. As I write this, I am now watching the restored version on a professionally set-up high quality plasma screen and my own high quality sound system and I have to say that my opinion of this restored version has changed considerably.I have to put the problems detailed above down to the cinema rather than this restoration of 2001.Firstly the sound quality is extremely good. The sound field is well defined there is virtually no distortion, although unfortunately some fierce limiting and compression on Also Sprach Zarathustra.The quality of the images is actually quite stunning - gorgeous rich blacks, superb skin tones and glowing whiteness - in fact it is hard to imagine a better grading then this. The only the very minor issue that remains is the slight horizontal wobble on a lot of the shots which is normally attributable to either warn or distorted sprocket holes or issues with the original camera . This may well have been due to the use of multiple runs of the negative through the cameras. It is normally relatively easy to correct this type of wobble but if different images on the frame are wobbling differently then probably it is best left alone! This is a very minor point - it is barely noticeable, and I only noticed it because I have worked on some restoration of old 16 millimetre films and seen this effect and worked on the correction of it.My conclusion is that in fact the 2001 restored version is superb and should be watched by anyone who enjoys the genius of Kubrick at his best. If you can view it on a very high quality television with extremely good quality sound then I think that may be better than relying on a cinema.Oh, and with all this stuff about the technical quality, I ought to mention that the story is Just amazing when you allow yourself to be totally immersed in it. And, the pacing of the film is perfection. The genius of Kubrick and his amazingly talented team. If you take your pleasures slow and sweet, this will delight.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Visually numbing,"I could add all the superlatives that were already said, but this would be unnecessary.As pure movie making, I have never had my visual and auditory senses more stimulated than they were here.

We all expect something different when we watch a film.But this film makes an impact on any one who appreciates film making as an art form. It is a story without a plot.

Excellent Besides The Music,So the reason why I am giving this a 7 out of 10 even though it's an excellent movie is for no other reason than the music. There was that choir in there singing and wailing what it sounded to me like was a choir of the damned those bound to hell wailing at their misfortune and it made me think of death and decay and a bugs swarming around a dead animal and it got way to loud and annoying i really hated that part especially because this was such an excellent movie but that wailing choir of the damned was a poor choice for music I honestly believe that choir is best made for a movie about Satan rather then an excellent movie like this one whenever I heard that choir the only think i could think of that was going to happen was there was going to be a bloody murder with an axe or an alien that looked like a demon that ate humans in a really gruesome way so to me it was a poor choice of music with that choir and nothing else the rest was absolutely excellent if you can ignore the wailing of the damned.,7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One word: AVOID!,"Warning! Do not see this movie unless you're planning to waste more than two hours of your life. This has (without doubt) to be one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. If you're still going to watch this, then just remember that you can easily skip the first 25 minutes, because they add nothing of interest except from some great background music by Strauss. The first 15 minutes or so,.for example, is just a bunch of scenes with some apes in a prehistoric environment, and is totally pointless. To be more general about it, the movie has no point at all. It has way too many scenes that last way too long. The plot is boring nearly all the way. There was some hope for it at a moment in the movie, but nothing exciting happened after all. The ending is also incredibly stupid and a really strange one. This is not a movie. This is total garbage and an insult to all the movie fans out there.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I can't see why this film is so highly-regarded.,"To be honest, since I grew up with Sci-Fi flicks like ""Star Wars"", ""Aliens"", and the various ""Star Trek"" series and movies, I'm afraid I can't say how impressive the special effects were for 1968.That said, I also can't see what the freakin' big deal is with this movie!It's extremely slow, the majestic movements through space really don't add anything, the dialogue is extremely bland, and the ""trip""......I guess it's one of those ""You Had To Be There"" moments, in this case, 1968.The only real noteworthy part of this should be HAL, which emphasized reliance on computers and what happens when one goes rogue, ironically but blindly foreshadowing such things as the defused Y2K problem. But aside from that, this movie is a big artistic dud for me. The only reason I'd recommend it is to see it's sequel, ""2010"", which makes a lot more sense, is more entertaining, and answers SOME of the questions left by 2001.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Space Documentary,"This film's production is marvellous and detailed in such a degree to make your suspension of belief ease you into a convincing piece of speculative fiction. Lacking any human drama, and leisurely in pace, the film features many mundane scenes documenting life, but with many profound consequences.Exposition is told by various news items, Kubrick's ability to tell a story with images is amazing. A rather simple story depicting human evolution, and conflict with technology, there is little dialogue, but the use of images tells the story compellingly and not without a loss understanding. The images are utterly effective in reaching out to the viewer. The images themselves are strong, generally quite beautifully, and discretely shot, to not disturb the reality the film sets forth.The acting is very natural, the astronauts are cool and collected, professional at their jobs, and staying away from any unnecessary human emotions to mar the story. HAL 9000, is wonderfully played, his chipper voice a dead set against the human actors, his words filled with almost sarcasm and arrogance, before his genuinely emotional exit.I like the way humanity's next great venture, that of space travel, is juxtaposed with a symbol of humanity's next great evolution. 2001: A Space Odyssey plays like a documentary filled with wonderful music flow perfectly with the images, and fits the enormity of space adventure. It a glorious undertaking, of great ambition, but shot with such naturalism as to convince us of humanity's achievements.

An Intelligent Sci Fi experience,"I know that some people don't like 2001 because of the slow pacing, and I can understand their opinion because 2001 is slow at getting to its meaning. Upon watching the film I had those same opinions as well, but as it moved on I found a deeper understanding of the movie and was glad that it didn't rush to its conclusion. This really is a movie about these dark fascinating arrows (the monoliths) which lead mankind on a path to higher evolution. In order to understand the meaning better, one only has to watch this movie in its entirety and be prepared to think deeply. Yes it is a thinking man's movie, unlike something like Armaggeddon.Along the way Stanley Kubrick give us fantastic special effects and also uses music. There is very little dialogue, but that is the point of the movie. In fact the thing that has the most dialogue is the Hal computer, and Hal himself seems more human then the two astronauts he must protect on the voyage in space. Since this is a movie about evolution, that is quite understandable.Some movies are slow and can be a real bore if they have no strong points to make. 2001 is not like that at all. The pacing was perfect because it draws you deeper into the movie to make you think, and that was the point. I loved this movie and would recommend it to everybody who likes movies with deeper meaning. If you are looking for a movie filled with intense violence and wall to wall action, well then 2001 is not for you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Visually Stunning and Ahead of Time,"In 1968, I was a young teenager when ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" was released in Brazil and I confess I did not understand the movie, although fascinated by the visual. Later I saw it again on VHS and DVD and read some articles to understand some parts about the film. I have just watched again since I am revisiting Stanley Kubrick filmography, and presently I still believe ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is visually stunning and ahead of time. The haunting music score with ""Thus Spoke Zarathustra"" (by Richard Strauss) and The Blue Danube ( by Johann Strauss) among others is another plus. Kubrick probably wanted to make the viewer feel how space tourism and business would be in the future, with lack of gravity. The boring screenplay is too slow and has many ""segments"" and Hal's one is certainly the best. Artificial Intelligence was not a subject of discussion in 1968 and certainly was a theme ahead of time. The last segment seems to be a meaningless psychedelic trip to the brain of the astronaut. The idea of a computer acquiring feelings is interesting, since the whole movie is about evolution, and this would be the last stage of a machine meaning having conscious. Meanwhile, man retrogresses to the primitive state of ""murdering"" the computer. The greatest point about this film is to make the viewer think and discuss the storyline.

"Excellent for its time, but beginning to grey around the edges","I know that I'll offend the great masses for saying this. Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Oddyssey"" is showing its age.

But the pacing of the film strikes me as uneven, and the acting is wooden on almost all counts. Many will say that this is a film about emotion and ideas. A pity then that the cast comes across as secondary, to the visuals.If ever there was a film that was a product of the psychedelic age, this would be it.

The space looks absolutely haunting and breathtaking even though the movie was released as back as 1968. The movie may come as a confusing tale to some folks, but nevertheless its complexity is fully necessary to give the viewer the ultimate pleasure of the whole wide space. The movie is very thematic and raises up larger than life questions which define our place in the universe, our struggle for supremacy, our evolution.In the end, Stanley Kubrick has brought us with a film which is unforgettable and is sure to create buzz for times to come.My score : 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I saw this movie in the theater for its 20yr anniversary, the film had been restored, the sound was modernized (for 1988) and 20min of footage was added back. Before that I had only seen it on PBS.If you have not seen this movie, understand that Kubrick does not follow the same movie formula. Along with his wonderful use of lighting, camera positioning, colors and script modifications; Kubrick will also test your time patience and your tolerance for understanding.So for those of you who have not seen this movie, rent the 148min version, watch it on a big beautiful TV and keep the remote handy. There will be portions where you will want to fast forward scenes at 2x or 4x. There is also a thing called a Intermission (for you youngsters this is for back in the day when the reels of film only fit a certain amount of time so they used 2 reels). You can use this time to make a sandwich or go the restroom. Here is a tidbit...Kubrick only has critical scenes when people are in them. Pause and FFWD at will if it keeps you watching, go ahead.The theater had its die hard fans, who knew it was safe to go get popcorn or go to the bathroom at certain points. And it had some people with short-modern-attention spans who left the theater after 1 hour.I loved this movie. In a non religious way, Kubrick shows you the evolution of man with god. And takes a good attempt at what death/afterlife might look like. But bear in mind this movie was made in 1968, so for its time these special effects were so outstanding you did not mind watching them for 10 or 20 extra minutes.No it is not perfect, I wish some scenes were shorter, I wish there was more explanation about the moon monolith and I wish some scenes moved faster. But like any masterworks...you must accept the artist work as a whole, in other words take the good with the bad.Worth Renting...if you like it...then Buy it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
THE Classic Space Movie,"The first time I've seen this movie, I was bored and disappointed, because I had false expectations, but after awhile I understood the idea behind it: This movie tells a story of the development of mankind and shows the beauty and infinity of space. When you watch it, then you must absorb the atmosphere.This movie shows Hollywood, that a really good space movie should have an experience, which makes you speechless (when you think about it), and not a brainless action movie with stereotypical heroes.Apart from some scenes, which are a bit too long for me, this movie is wonderful. When it came out, this technology revolutionized the filmmaking!9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Kubrick's masterpiece stands the test of time,"2001: a space odyssey is undoubtedly one of the greatest movies of all time. It poses many more questions than answers. And the scene with the Monolith on the moon is maybe the scariest scene I've ever seen. Not because of a jump scare, because it makes you think. Kubrick once said ""if someone comes out of (2001) with a clear answer, they did not view it correctly"". For days after watching it I just sat and thought about what it meant. And it was made before even had a man on the moon! And it's influence can still be felt today, with movies like Interstellar. And in my opinion it is the greatest science fiction movie of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Ahead of it's time,"2001: A Space Odyssey is ahead of it's time. Movie came in 1968 and showed so many things which didn't exist before 90s. This movie is said to be best space movie ever made. I disagree. Yes, it might be best space movie of it's time but not of all time.Movie doesn't make perfect sense to me. The story is normal, the characters don't really get through you and the ending made no sense to me. The movie was unnecessarily slow paced and too long (2½ hours). Movie didn't have any proper explaination.I just think this movie is too much overrated. I liked this movie just because it was ahead of its time wheather you talk about visual effects, general idea of the movie and the idea of what space was like.Overall, I liked the movie for the reasons I told earlier but at the same time I would same that it is overrated and boring.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Victory of Style Over Content,"Representing both the summit of Kubrick's achievement and the beginning of his decline.When he originally decided to make a science fiction film for grownups the genre had long ago been brought into disrepute by the perennial lack of investment both of imagination and money on the part of film makers.In 1964 with 'Strangelove' completed Kubrick looked upwards and outward with the intention of rescuing this oft maligned genre to which end he asked ""Who is the greatest science fiction writer alive today?"", which raises the interesting question of just what kind of film would have resulted had the answer been Robert Heinlein or Isaac Asimov.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Brilliant, but could have been 30-45 mins shorter.","I cannot deny the excellent, thought provoking story that this film tells. I loved the cinematography, the acting, the plot, the special effects and set, the script, and virtually everything else.  I really really wanted to love this film, but it seems like every time I fell in love with it, I got hit upside the head with an audio-visual baseball bat.  I see why Kubrick wanted to draw certan scenes or metaphors out, but some were just draw TOO DARN LONG.  The music was great during the disturbing/moving parts, but I literally got sick to my stomach after 5 straight minutes of the same eery music.  I had to fast forward during some parts, or at least mute the sound. In some places he just ran a good idea into the ground, drawing out scenes 4 times longer than is healthy, and twice as long as would be necessary to make a lasting impression.  6/10 (would have been a 9 or 10.

2001 : A Space Odyssey,"Considering that the movie was released before moon landing, the details are unbelievable. I can't even imagine the vision it would take to possess such insight. The graphics are stunning for that time, the importance of sound to make this movie such an experience cannot be emphasized enough. The lack of dialogues forces us to use our imagination. At times, it did feel like some of the scenes in the latter part of the movie, showcasing the graphics, could be a bit shorter but it may be because over the years,with technology, movies with much better effects have been released.In short, watch this movie for the details, the sound, for Kubrick's vision and for the countless Sci-fi movies this movie has inspired.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"If you can keep your patience, this is a gem...","First off, it's easy to see why many people can't relate to the hype surrounding this film. Yes, it's complex, the characters are dull to the point of stuffed animals and it's full of lengthy, uneventful sequences.However, I've always felt Kubrick's genius as a director lay not in his visual portrayal of action, but rather his subtle conveyance of symbolism and metaphor. And boy, is 2001 symbolic.It helps to be prepared for a film like 2001. This isn't something you can expect to understand the first time you watch it. Looking deeply into Kubrick's exploration of themes such as control, technology, perception, and the philosophy of existence will reveal this picture as a true gem. Its human characters appear tedious because they only serve as vessels through which the film's rich events and experiences are translated on to us.2001 is an intriguing probe into what it means to exist and to see the world. It's very deep and philosophical, but such is the case with most of Kubrick's productions. The soundtrack is epic as it is beautiful, and the effects used are truly ground breaking for their time. It's not an easy watch - but if you can watch it with the open mindedness that I think Kubrick intended, 2001 will make you think about it afterwards... and that makes it a powerful piece of cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"One of the greatest, an unparalleled vision of science, evolution and man's place in the universe.","Stanley Kubrick's magnum opus; philosophically powerful, technically breathtaking, narratively thrilling, and artistically unparalleled.The visuals are timeless in their organic construction and the audio is Kubrickian baroque.The score. The score. The score. 2001 changed the way music was done in cinema, it was now a necessity. And music has never been used better than in 2001.The film's clearest message is about the underlying human nature that pushes us from using bone tools to interplanetary spaceships - the progress of man – but that is just the surface.2001: A Space Odyssey came at a time when man was on the precipice between the greatest achievement in the history of humanity and total predetermined nuclear apocalypse. Both are the gifts of science and progress, hence both are the result of man doing or undoing – 2001 offers nothing more than step back and view us for what we are, what we have become, and what we might become. Certainly the film I feel most comfortable saying in is one the greatest.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"A far advanced sci-fi film for its day, with fiction far beyond science","""2001: A Space Odyssey"" clearly has excellent sets showing the material and equipment aspects of space travel. For that part of this film, the research and study by Stanley Kubrick and Arthur Clarke, and the input sought from NASA and other expert sources, was exemplary. The basic scenes of space craft and travel are very accurate and realistically portrayed. That part, and the general screenplay of space travel, are excellent. One might think of this as the first element of this movie.The second element is an interesting, if haunting, picture of a computer that can ""reason"" itself into control of a space mission to the point of committing murder. I don't recall ever having heard or read much attention given to that aspect among the critics when this film came out, or since then. Yes, there is considerable comment about HAL, but little thought is given to a ""thinking"" computer that commits murder. This second element constitutes the largest portion of the film. The interplay between the space crew - Dr. Dave Bowman mostly, makes up more than half of the film.The third element is what gets the most attention, it seems, by everyone; yet it takes up the smallest portion of the film. Depending on who's critique one considers, this aspect of the film is described as artistic, imaginative, futuristic, psychedelic, incoherent, bizarre, weird, nonsensical..... The descriptives go on and on.The history of this film is interesting in itself. When it premiered, a significant number of people walked out during the show. It received more criticism than praise by critics and later commentors noted that many people were smoking ""strange cigarettes"" in the theaters. The reference was to psychedelic reactions or ""trips"" high on drugs. The film was further edited with Kubrick cutting nearly 20 minutes from the quite long show, and it was released, then re-released, and released again over the next few years. The film didn't cover its budget in the first go round, but by repeated releases it eventually made a considerable profit. Kubrick had words for the harsh critics of the film, especially in New York. He said they were ""dogmatically atheistic and materialistic and earthbound.""These decades later, the film has been viewed much more positively. Film historians, critics and movie buffs have offered all sorts of explanations and dissections of the film, especially the highly fictional last aspect. The visuals of Bowman's experience, whether something he is supposed to be really seeing within the movie, or purely imagining, are very colorful, quick, and tossed together. It is a kaleidoscope of fiction. It might be how one could imagine a drug trip as someone who has had such tries to explain it to someone who hasn't.Among the various comments about the film are that it is a type of Odyssey, borrowing from Homer's ""Odyssey."" Some see religious reincarnation or new worlds. Others see any number of philosophical connections.I don 't know about any of that, or if Kubrick and Clarke actually borrowed or intended any such connections. Anyone who can recall their imagining something in the future - space travel, adventures, great achievements or conquests, etc., can understand how the fictional life portrayals at the end could be imagined. Why not? It's fiction.I suspect that the early dislike for this film by many was a reaction from expectations about an interesting, exciting and intriguing adventure in space. Something along the order of ""The Martian"" of 2015. So, when the film so slowly plods along with the computer interacting with the crew and they one-by-one get eliminated, it no doubt felt more like a mystery in space than a sci-fi film. Anyway, the fictional time warps and aspects like that that this film gets into at the end have been aspects of other sci-fi films since then, most notably in various sequels of the ""Star Trek"" films.For the technical and scientific portrayals and qualities, this film is exceptional for its day. In sci-fi, I prefer more of the space challenges and adventure types of films, rather than the fictional off-the-chart speculations about time warps, and far out concepts. While this is a good film that some may enjoy, it's not likely that many in the 21st century culture that seeks faster and faster games and excitements would sit still very long for this slow film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A Timeless Journey Through Space and Mind-Stunning, Eerie, and Utterly Unique","""2001: A Space Odyssey"" isn't just a film-it's an experience. Stanley Kubrick's meticulous craftsmanship makes this one of the most visually striking movies ever made. From the opening ""Dawn of Man"" sequence to the mind-bending Star Gate finale, the film feels less like watching a story and more like floating through a dreamscape.Let's talk about the visuals first-because wow. The silent vastness of space paired with classical music, particularly ""The Blue Danube"", is hauntingly beautiful. I still think of that iconic shot where the bone turns into a spacecraft. It's such a clever way to show human progress, and it gives you chills if you really let it sink in.The pacing, though-let's be honest-is slow. I usually hate that in films, but here, the deliberate pace becomes part of its hypnotic charm. You aren't spoon-fed answers or flashy action sequences. Kubrick forces you to sit with the silence and mystery. Still, I could have done with slightly less time staring at floating space shuttles. Just slightly.And HAL 9000? The perfect antagonist. A cold, calculated AI with a soft, eerily calm voice-""I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."" It's unsettling because HAL doesn't look like a villain. That red eye staring blankly at you as it slowly unravels... it's brilliant. Dave Bowman, played by Keir Dullea, is great in his understated performance as the astronaut forced to outwit HAL. The moment he dismantles HAL while the machine begs for its ""life"" is both creepy and strangely sad. Who knew I could feel bad for a computer?There's something bold about a film that doesn't explain itself. You leave with more questions than answers-What was the monolith? Was the Star Child humanity's next evolution?-but that ambiguity is exactly why it sticks with you. It doesn't try to neatly tie up the universe because the universe isn't neat.I didn't love every second, but the artistry is undeniable. Kubrick crafted a film that feels eternal-its themes about technology, evolution, and human existence remain as relevant as ever. If you're patient enough to embrace its strangeness, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" will leave you staring at the screen, wide-eyed and amazed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
a film that feels like no other,"This film, has powerful moments though it seems nothing that could've been made on this planet.

A nerve wracking chess game.,"I went to see this movie on theaters recently and, oh dear, has it been a unique experience.
This movie is really silent. It takes its time to slowly build a full synopsis and it slowly becomes more claustrophobic and tense, and it's all because of the silence, an incredible use of silence.
The environment is peaceful, but the tension in the air puts you on the edge of your seat and makes you wonder what will happen next.

As I was watching, I couldn't believe it was shot almost 60 years ago - it hasn't aged a bit. It's probably the first sci-fi movie from the past, and perhaps the only one, that is truly timeless. The final scene alone is worth all the praise the movie revceives.Overall, this motion picture is a cosmically beautiful, visually pristine, thought-provoking masterpiece that was so ahead of its time that even today, it feels like it's a movie from the future.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

My brothers were appalled by it saying, ""Nothing happens to warrant it being good, but nothing happens to warrant it being bad. But it's still bad for being boring."" I, personally, don't think anyone is stupid for saying harsh things about this. Afteral, this film is about making you feel through images rather than dialogue. If that doesn't appeal to you, I understand that.Film is more than story. I firmly believe that. If you were to take music out of certain films they wouldn't have nearly the same effect. This film is about simulating real life space travel. Actually, well I can't completely tell you what this is about as the film itself has the effect of an art gallery. You stare and behold art. Maybe you respect it, maybe you think art is overrated.The film does, like most works of Stanley Kubrick, make me feel uncomfortable at times. Just the way it looks and feels. It's eerie.

A mixed bag,"This is regarded by some as a classic film for all ages. And in some sense, those critics are right. This film is a spectacle unlike other films of the time - the special effects in this film will inspire countless others like Star Wars 9 years later. Regardless, for me (as for some others), that's all it is, spectacle, a 3 HOUR spectacle that goes on and on. It is SO esoteric that it is probably way above most people's heads. And even though I understand what the filmmaker was going for, it is still too far-fetched for me. On the plus side, Stanley Kubrick makes proper use of classical music (in this case, Richard Strauss) and does have the aforementioned specular special effects. However, if you want to see a stronger focus on story, see its sequel 2010: Odyssey Two.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Overrated,"I just saw this movie for the first time for a class, and I have to say I was disappointed.  I've been told that some of this stems from my having read Arthur C. Clarke's book, which has nothing to do with the film. But I enjoyed the book and had trouble sitting through this movie.  I can certainly see why it was considered a 'drug movie' in the 70's.  It has a lot of the same elements of the music of the period - long, drawn out, surreal sections of time full of discordant images (or sounds).  It is most likely art and as such, appreciated or hated by its viewers.  But as a movie, I thought it stunk.  As a storyteller, it stunk. I'm sure people will try to explain the film's cosmic beauty or underlying amazingness on a level I will never understand, or tell me that it's precisely because it bored me to tears and was mostly incoherent and repetitive that makes it great.  Maybe I shouldn't have read the book first. But I can not imagine ever wanting to see this movie again.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An over-rated audio-visual assault,"Yeah I know, it's one of the best movies and by one of the most important directors of all time.  And I also know that as a film student, it's my duty to like it.  Well sorry, I didn't.  (No disrespect to the dearly departed Kubrick; this is just my humble opinion.)Lucky me, I got to see 2001 in its entirety within a theatrical setting (ie. seated in a hard, uncomfortable chair with the sound at full blast but only one chance to take a bathroom break) for a film course I took last semester.Now had I seen it in the comfort of my own home with the ability to turn down the sound or move about as I pleased, then maybe I would have been able to appreciate the film.  Instead, I spent most of the 3 or so hours with my hands over my ears or my eyes squeezed shut wishing that someone would be kind enough to put me out of my misery.  By the time I left the auditorium, I was nauseous and suffering from a splitting headache.In addition, I can't imagine why past critics were so puzzled about the film's theme since its just about visually beaten into the audience within the first 20 minutes, which could have easily been reduced to five.  Okay, okay.  Technology bad.  Tree pretty (inside joke).  I get it already.  Now can someone pass me an aspirin?",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
THE film of its time.,"As I watched this film for the first time today, I wondered what it might have felt like to experience the work of Kubrick in his own era.I am a college student living in the 21st century. My era is crowded by quick fixes and easy solutions. We need entertainment now and it must be easy for us to understand otherwise it is seemingly impossible to enjoy.And I believe that to a lesser degree, the 1960s were the same way. People were well accustomed to the television and the shallow entertainment that it made possible. Where every episode could follow the same basic model as long as it came to a clean conclusion in the end.So even at the time of this film's release it must have been a daring thing to feature 10-15 minute shots of space equipment floating in a void. The fact that this film has endured these 4 decades is a testament to its power.Though it displays beauty and creativity unlike any film in those days (and indeed most today), its true power is derived from the imagination of its creator.Essencially this film describes the human experience. Consciousness and intellect, the two defining factors that have propelled us to prominence as a species. Here we are, but how? Here we live, but to what purpose? I don't profess to fully grasp this film and every aspect therein, but it has sparked in my mind a feeling of inquisitiveness. I hope to return to this film soon to experience even more wonder and curiosity.Wonderfully imagined, vibrantly executed, and brilliantly timeless.

"""Open the Pod Bay Doors, HAL""","A lot of people don't like this movie, and putting the label on them stating they just don't ""get it"" really isn't fair. Because a lot of the criticisms against the movie are valid. The lack of dialogue and extended musical/visual scenes are definitely not something the general film-going public nowadays will flock to see (it's an absolute shame, but it's the reality). It truly is a slow-paced movie without much of a plot, too, which a lot of people dislike the film for.
Today, on its fifty-second anniversary, i have finally decided to sit down and view the film from start to finish, and I have to say I'm thoroughly impressed.
This isn't a movie that is designed to be watched like other movies. It's not something you can put on in the background while you're making supper or doing the dishes; this is a film that requires you to both watch and contemplate throughout. The stunning visuals (that held up over the years, I might add) only serve to amplify the beauty in simplicity that Kubrick was going for in this film.
With 2001: A Space Odyssey, you really get out of the movie what you put in. If you're looking for casual entertainment that can provide background noise while you surf your phone, this film will be a major disappointment. If you're looking for some deep plot, you'll also, likewise, be disappointed. George Lucas said it best himself when he explained the plot as being ""razor thin."" It's an extremely basic story told in a very grandiose way. It's pretentious (I don't mind), it's rambling (somehow I ended up enjoying all the extended sequences), and it's unlike anything else, which is both a good and a bad thing. Good in the sense that, aside from being parodied and tributed (not a word) to absolute death, there hasn't really been anything to my knowledge that has come out that felt like an imitation of this film. It's a bad thing because I would definitely have loved for Kubrick to explore this kind of filmmaking a little more in his lifetime.This is a confusing, baffling, mind-bending movie that requires more than one watch, without question. Film students adore it; Kubrick and sci-fi fans around the world hail it for what it accomplished both cinematically and in terms of its unique story-telling antics.

""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is a simplistic yet inspiring piece of meticulous filmmaking at it's most primal, a cinematic meditation of tranquility and wonder, a hypnotic experience, a deeply effective testament of human psychology through and through, a mysteriously mind-bending science-fiction story that regards human evolution, a grounded hybrid that crosses between arthouse filmmaking and roller-coaster-ride entertainment, and ultimately, the grandfather of many imitators of this particular genre that associates it's traditional tropes. This is the kind of film that inspired George Lucas to become a filmmaker for the ""Star Wars"" movies from ""A New Hope"" to the prequels. This may have inspired other people to become popular filmmakers as well, especially when they are making movies that take place in outer space, like Andrew Stanton who directed Pixar's ""WALL. E."" As the producer, writer, and director, Stanley Kubrick takes full control as the head of this enterprise, and he knows exactly how to create pure amazement with sophisticated brilliance, due to the fact that he has the unusual vision for mesmerizing suspense that makes the film shine with manipulative timing and gripping visual art, as he concocted a visually haunting yarn of unforgettable flashy set-pieces, leading up to the eye-popping climax. Alongside of the fact that the large scope of it's wonderful cinematography is nothing short of incredible to look at. Yet it's the exquisite usage of sound designs at the most appropriate times that really ties this film together to play us like a piano. The film also possesses a superb usage of classical orchestral music in order to produce thematic melodies for certain elements. The grandiose ""Also sprach Zarathustra"" fanfare was used for scenes where something extraordinary happens, while the beautiful Blue Danube Waltz melody was used to capture the wonderous beauty of space. But that's not all: the eerie vocalizing of a large choir was used to enhance the scenes involving the mysterious, unworldly Monolith. The convincing visual effects are so incredible, that we would think to ourselves ""how on earth did they do that?!"" Not to mention that the production design makes us want to explore the inside of the spacecraft. The cast on set did a very fine job with their collected performances, as they play the adventurous astronaut archetypes, whom are trying their best to keep their cool. The two prime astronauts are Dave Bowman (Keir Dulla) and Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood). They are investigating this mysterious alien-life, as well as having concerns for their mission. Douglas Rain provided the quietly wise voice performance for HAL 9000, an intelligent computer (in the form of a round eye with a red pupil) that controls the spacecraft called Discovery One.

Pavement To Interstellar,"The most enticing, audio dynamic and interconnecting introduction ever, to say there wasn't a whole lot going on but monkey business, this act was extremely interesting.Kubrick truly transcends me to one of the most ancient ages of time then subliminally cuts back to a standardised version of living, this time, way higher up off the ground. This exemplifies the two conceptual ways in which we think as a species, primitive and intellectually, setting the scene before he slowly delves into what 'A Space Odyssey' reveals to us as an audience, that we are all but the same vessel.The use of eery ambience foreshadows the unknown abyss that also came about as the astronauts got suited and booted. This film is slow moving, but far from boring as some suggest. It is very much a film where, as it goes on, greater attention to detail is to be given and definitely holds up with the new age of cinematography, it is visually surreal.INTERMISSION...Now then, VAL is now a top psychological-thriller villain, in background sound effects, a feeling residing a spiritual quietness within me but at the same time a deep, entrancing terror in the Count Dracula like noise.

Beyond the Infinite: Kubrick's Vision in '2001: A Space Odyssey',"In ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" Stanley Kubrick transports us into the depths of space and the mysteries of human evolution. The film begins with the dawn of man and transcends through time to an era of space exploration, where humanity confronts its own creation and the vast unknown.Kubrick's direction in ""2001"" is nothing short of visionary. His meticulous attention to scientific accuracy, combined with groundbreaking special effects, creates an immersive and thought-provoking experience. The film's slow pacing and lack of conventional narrative structure invite the audience to contemplate the themes of evolution, artificial intelligence, and the unknown.Kubrick, along with writer Arthur C. Clarke, offers a unique and philosophical perspective on humanity's place in the universe. The iconic monoliths serve as catalysts for human evolution, symbolizing the unfathomable aspects of existence. The film's ambiguity encourages varied interpretations, making it a perpetual subject of discussion and analysis.Kubrick's intent was to create a cinematic experience that questions our understanding of life, intelligence, and the cosmos. The film deliberately leaves many questions unanswered, reflecting the enigmatic nature of the universe. Kubrick's use of classical music, particularly Strauss's ""Also sprach Zarathustra,"" enhances the grandeur and mystery of the film.""2001: A Space Odyssey"" stands as a monumental achievement in cinema, renowned for its visionary approach, technical excellence, and profound philosophical implications. It has become a benchmark for science fiction films and continues to inspire and intrigue audiences and filmmakers alike. This film would rank highly on any scale for its innovation in storytelling, visual effects, and its enduring impact on cinema and culture.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"a god among mortals, one of, if not the greatest film of time","This film, a masterpiece in storytelling and images. Kubrick's masterpiece and (not that it matters) my favorite film of all time. First off, this is not a date movie (unless your date is in the mood for confusion) this is a movie that you have to be prepared to watch, you wake up and say ""i'm going to watch 2001 today"" make your popcorn and sit on your couch, volume up. You have to give yourself to this movie. I guess i should talk about the movie now. since we were just talking about volume, we should talk about sound. This movie is a masterclass in sound design and music in film. The music is masterful, whenever it plays, the mood is apparent and, more importantly, you feel it , whether that be awe as in the moon landing, or fear as in all the monolith scenes, or isolation as in the discovery's scenes. The music is amazing, along with the sound design. now, let's speak of the story, now, i'm not going to spoil a thing, this is a film you need to experience with an open mind, so, i'll just say, this is not a plot that is easily followed, at all, this is a film where if you ask ten people for their thoughts, you'll get ten different answers, it's convoluted, hard to follow and weird (unless you read the book, which came out the same time as the film, then that explains a lot). most of the plot comes in form of dialogue between the characters and, of course, though visual storytelling. let's talk about the visuals now, shall we? It is amazing, it won the movie an Oscar, and its even more amazing when you realize that there were no computers used in the making of the movie, none. the stargate scene is especially beautiful . all of these things come together to make something that goes above film, into the realm of artistic masterwork, along with films like The Godfather and Eraserhead. it's defiantly a film worth checking out.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Can you IMAGINE walking into the cinema and watching this after being used to black and white flying saucers wobbling on strings ? It still gives shivers to its audience FIFTY years on.

A difficult movie,"In this age of technologically advanced films with jaw-dropping special effects and ennervatingly simple-minded plots, characters and dialogue, this film will seem difficult.  It's definitely not for casual leave-your-brain-at-home viewing.First there is the dialogue, or lack thereof.  There is no talking at all for the first half hour of the film, and long stretches thereafter where no one says anything.  This can be alienating to modern viewers who are used to vapid actors inanely flapping their mouths and spewing forth loads of verbal diarrhea.  Second, the film moves slowly, often very slowly.  Again, disconcerting to people not accustomed to exercising their attention spans. Third, the plot is inscrutable, often requiring the viewer to think fairly hard about what is going on.  'Nuff said about that.The special effects, especially the photographic effects, are stunning, even after thirty-one years.  I suspect, though, that time and its attendant advances in technology have dulled the visual effect a bit.Yes, this movie requires a lot of effort from the viewer.

It's True What Critics Say About This,"Don't judge this movie based on the first scenes, the whole movie makes more sense the more you go along. It seems one scene depends on the next scene. In more basic terms that define good movies from bad, the acting is not exactly connected to romance or sadness, but is more intelligent, dramatic, and intense. HAL 9000's monotone voice and calibrated actions are ones that will find it's way into every crack of your mind. Also, just a warning, if you don't like breathing noises, get as far away as you can from this movie and anyone who likes it, or just skip it. The movie has long sequences lingering on the same object or area for long periods, never ending scenes in both a meditative and annoying way. The ending is absolutely head scratching.

I can't put into words the amount of times you will be sitting there and wondering why nothing has happened in 7 minutes; no dialogue, no story or character development, no music, no information. I feel like this could have easily been put into an hour and 20 minute movie. I have to give credit to its revolutionary nature in cinema, a sort of backbone for science fiction, one of my favorite genres, and the acting isn't too bad but with the pacing issues, disproportioned props and an overall odd experiences, I do not recommend this for a favorable viewing experience.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Open the pod bay doors, Hal","At what point does a film transcend the medium and become something else entirely? How long does that process take? And would it even be recognizable afterward? Are these even answerable questions? I'm not sure they are, but in the 50 years since the original release of this Stanley Kubrick seminal Sci-Fi tale one thing has become abundantly clear - 2001: A Space Odyssey has not only transcended its own genre but cinema in general.When Kubrick and his crew started production on this film I don't think anyone could possibly have known they were going to be changing the face of cinema forever. Sometimes, though, cinema can be a fickle mistress and the world didn't really take to the film right away. Many people and pundits called it boring and overly confusing. Which is still a main complaint of several people even today, but it is impossible (for my money anyway) not to be swept up in the grandness of it all. The overall epic feeling of this film has been practically unmatched in the 5 decades since its release. A multitude of things in this film have stood the test of time over the years...starting with its unbelievable Oscar winning visual effects. For a film that came out in 60's to have effects that not only hold up today but are better than just about every movie that has come out since is hard to comprehend considering how advanced technology has become. It doesn't seem like it should be possible but the proof is in the pudding. And it's not just the visual effects...this film is packed to the brim with some of the greatest techs to have ever graced the screen. Production Design, Cinematography, Costume Design and Sound are all exquisite and stand toe-to-toe with any of the best ever in those categories.A knock on this film would seem to be that the characters always take a backseat to the visuals and the story suffers as a result. Now, that's not an entirely inaccurate statement, but at the same time it's not one that I really subscribe to. This is a visual story. Plain and simple. It makes perfect sense that the characters wouldn't necessarily matter much at the end of the day. Except there's more to it than that. We actually spend quite a bit of time with different characters throughout the 2-and-a-half hour runtime. The static camera shots that stay on the characters as they complete their day-to-day routine aboard the space station and giving us little morsels of info about their lives back home on Earth is all more than enough (for me anyway) to get in-tune with these characters. There is one character, however, that should get and keep your attention and that's HAL 9000; the robotic intelligence system built into the ship. He is able convey a wide range of emotions with just a voice and a little red camera light. Props to actor Douglas Rain for being able to create such a great character with just his voice. He strikes a perfect balance between unassuming and menacing. I would like to make special mention of Keir Dullea, though, who stood out to me much more on this viewing. He is a man of few words in this film, but like Rain with his voice, Dullea says so much and displays an inordinate amount of emotion with just his eyes that it's almost a shock knowing he had any scripted dialogue in the first place.This was my third time seeing this overall and first in the theater. The 50th Anniversary IMAX screenings are making their way around the country, so I jumped at the opportunity. My first two viewings of this were at home on Blu-ray and while I liked it I wasn't blown away by it. That's happened to me before with so-called ""classics"" - some I've come around on and some I've stayed cool on. I'm one of those people who likes to believe that a film should be able to play just as well whether it's watched at home or in a theater setting and that opinion still holds true, but I will say with absolute certainty that watching 2001: A Space Odyssey in IMAX is 100% required viewing. Everything is enhanced the Nth degree that it's hard to imagine ever viewing the film any other way again. I had never seen a film in IMAX before so maybe my perspective is a little skewed here... either way, I'm going to focus on the Sound aspect. Since this was my first time seeing a film in this format all I really knew to expect was that the screen was much larger than an average theater screen. Well, I was not at all prepared for just how loud the sound was going to be. I don't have an exact figure for how much louder it is compared to what it is at a regular theater, but it felt like I was right inside the Pod Bay with Dave. Just an unreal experience.Kubrick managed to create something wholly unique and something that has numerous times been imitated but never duplicated. The DNA of 2001 has been felt on every Sci-Fi film over the past 50 years and will likely continue to be for many more years to come. Which brings me back to the original question posed: What happens when a film transcends a genre and cinema in general? What does it become and what are we left with as the audience? The answer is quite simply...Art.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
More than just a Regular Film - it is beyond that,"Space Odyssey is not a film that I emotionally enjoyed, but it's brilliant in its technical aspects. This movie came out before humans ever walked on the moon (!) and it shows us what the future of space travel might look like. It's full of amazing pictures and sounds that make you feel like you're really there. It was ahead of its time.The introduction didn't captivate me. The introduction of the film left me in a state of confusion because the movie starts in a way that is hard to understand. The lack of engagement led me to perceive the introduction as incredibly random. But in terms of technical aspects, I liked that the locations, of course, look very beautiful. Overall, the first 20 minutes of the movie were odd UNTIL I watched the near end of the film, which has a more mythical, philosophical, metaphorical, and deep meaning behind it that I don't really understand.Production design caught my attention first. I definitely like the futuristic production design. It is very detailed-just out of this world, very professional, detailed, and a bit blown away by how they did this in 1968.I absolutely adore the soundtrack to this film. The soundtrack features a beautiful gospel melody, complemented by orchestral elements playing in the background. Some sound FX were annoying to the ears, but other sound FX like breathing in and out and some oxygen noise were great. In the second act, I liked the ambient sounds; those sounds make peace of mind, as do the carefully selected sound effects like rotation and clicking. The quick sound cuts and editing cuts were shocking and sudden, which left me curious and wondering. The use of silence was masterful. I noticed the similarities in terms of using the sound and edit cuts in Christopher Nolan's Interstellar in the second act of the film. This gives the film a sense of fear from the unknown.The film's balanced approach to visual storytelling and dialogue was commendable. The slow-motion sequence was a deliberate choice at the same time. The film, for its time, is visually stunning. I like how static cinematography is, and sometimes it goes from the symmetric scene to going left or right on the camera and returning to the symmetrical center. How the cinematographer used various lenses, such as wide-angle lenses and regular lenses, was commendable.There is a sense of horror in the third act, which is more intense and provoking. The editing was top-notch in this film. I can feel the sense of professionalism and well-timed cuts, just like with Christopher Nolan's Interstellar (2014). The third act captivates me with its visually stunning and mind-blowing visual effects, evoking a sense of horror. Despite this, the film is quite lengthy and incorporates a plethora of horror-themed sound effects, creating a truly eerie atmosphere.Overall, the whole film left me in a lot of confusion. Emotion-wise, I was not particularly impressed; I was more confused, but I adored the technical aspects of the film. Even though it didn't make me feel a lot of emotions, the stunning space scenes and smart ideas left me even more curious and gave me ""aha"" moments. Watching the film is MORE like solving a puzzle than a regular watch (!!); you might not get it the first time, but it's worth trying again. I think everyone should see it at least once. In cinematic history, it is a classic space movie that makes you think and wonder about the big questions and think beyond them. The film still remains significant due to its depiction of the rise of AI. Also, film directors like Christopher Nolan, known for Interstellar (2014), and Greta Gerwig, who made Barbie (2023) to this day, take some inspiration from Stanley Kubrick's works. Hence, it's crazy that this film was made in 1968.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

You're Left Confused...but Satisfied,"This is definitely a film that you come back to watch again for two reasons: 1) You're not immediately sure you understood what happened, and 2) You are left feeling mentally/philosophically engaged.To be straight, you should know going into this film that you should have an eye for subtleties and symbolism, and above all, an open mind. From the onset, you can tell that the director is not going to attempt to appeal to the audience with fast paced action, explosions, etc. but rather with direct mental stimulation. You watch this film with a similar manner to that of an obscure yet significant painting, because the themes that are presented to you feel epic, and they are left open for interpretation; the lack of dialogue in favor of eerie music helps.However, even through all of the confusion, and tense mood, you also know you are watching something beautiful. With a few minor exceptions, the screenplay feels like it is consistently appealing to the eye in a simple nature.

There's something about the droning background noise and complete lack of any kind of action that just puts me in the mood to close my eyes.Now, I've said this to people over the decades and they tend to assure me that I don't like it because I am cognitively deficient in some way.

You come out feeling a bit cleaner, a good deal more jumbled, and all wet.It is a film in four parts. 1) A gang of prehumans discover how to defend their waterhole from a rival band by using bones as weapons. 2) An executive from the National Council of Astronautics visits a base on the Moon to investigate an incredible excavation find. 3) On the first manned flight to Jupiter, Astronauts Bowman and Poole have trouble with their computer assistant, HAL. 4) Bowman goes on an incredible journey beyond the known solar system and comes out the other side looking both very old and very young.Behind all these elements is the sometimes invisible, often active presence of a flat black monolith, inert in itself but capable of producing powerful reactions.What it all means, other than an often confusing 2 hours and 20 minutes, I don't know, but you have to give it up for director Stanley Kubrick. He made a film unlike any ever made, dealing with vast cosmic themes and philosophies, and it connected both with its own time and on to the present day. ""2001"" is still ranked the greatest sci-fi film of all time in many quarters.The images of ""2001"" remain powerful in isolation, and the overall story captures the evolutionary nature of man's existence in an often gripping way. But between the long shots of spacecraft docking and the odd Gregorian-style portentous chanting, the self-importance of this movie does grate, not to mention the thinness of the story.The part of the film that gets the most attention, the standoff between the astronauts and HAL, is alternately fascinating and labored. HAL seems to be ready to do to man what we saw man doing to those pig-like tapirs in Part 1, and it's up to Bowman to avoid being left behind by the evolutionary tide, not to mention being marooned in space. Long sections of astronauts moving in slow motion showcase the brilliant special effects but go on too long.What's good is very good, though, a terrific standoff between Bowman and HAL, brilliantly dramatized by actor Keir Dullea and the eerily dispassionate voice of Douglas Rain, with a chilling, powerful finale. There's even some humor. ""Take a stress pill and think things over"" is pretty funny when uttered by a killer about to get his.My favorite part of the film is the second section. Again, this features long slow-moving scenes, though used to better effect. The Strauss waltz accompanying the station-docking sequence still blows you away. William Sylvester as the Council executive, Dr. Floyd, has a striking cool efficiency about him that comes as quite a transition after the apemen in the opening. This sequence moves slowly but well to the mystery at the center of the story: I was disappointed to have it over with as quickly as it was.Some may wish Kubrick dropped Part 1. I wish he had dropped Part 4, which just throws a lot of half-baked concepts in the air and doesn't bother resolving any unless you happen to read post-film interviews with Kubrick or Clarke. One long visual sequence suggests what it might be like to be trapped in a Guitar Hero game programmed by H.P. Lovecraft.The last image is supposed to be triumphant, somehow, but winds up looking lost and sad. ""Going up or down?"" Dr. Floyd asks earlier in the film. Down was what it felt like to me. ""2001"" is great for what it is, a brilliantly thought-out and arrestingly executed enigma. For me, the enigma is this: How can a film be so great without also being that good?",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Horrible. Must be on drugs to enjoy this one...,"It's 1968, I guess you had to be on acid to enjoy this. I can't think of a worse, more boring film that I've seen.The first 25 minutes consists of people in monkey suits with no dialog. We are not told anything about what going on regarding the granite slab, what it is or anything.Worst of all, I didn't turn it off because I thought in the end, things would be explained. All I saw was more long, drawn out meaningless shots with no dialog -- AND IN THE END, NOTHING!!!Love Kubrick's The Killing (1955), hated this and is my worst film of all time!!!",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

One of the most beautiful films ever made,"I first watched this film on the big screen on its original release and was awe inspired by the experience. I have also watched it recently and the experience was just as pleasurable, like visiting an old friend. I still cannot describe the plot assuming of course that it has one. For me I am not at all interested about the plot since I have never been able to follow it but I continue to be blown away by the film on all the other levels of entertainment. It is unlike any other film I have ever seen and not being too bothered about the plot actually enhances the enjoyment. All those involved in its creation are to be congratulated for their care and attention. The technology that existed at the time must have been a hindrance but the end result is awesome. I would recommend anyone watch it but I would advise that whoever does should pay attention as I am clearly not bright enough to follow the story line. If it is a lot clearer to those that do please post it here as a review and I will watch it again with a new attitude and hopefully a additional perspective. This is one of those films on a short list of mine of films which don't age with time. You could watch this film in forty years time and it would still look stunning. I highly recommend it and don't forget to let me know and maybe some others who don't follow the plot in on the secret.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Cue Music Here!,"2001 is a movie I somewhat discovered late in life, and now can't get enough of. What it TOTALLY means is anyone's guess, but the film is filled with enough iconic images that you'll recognize anywhere from Polaris to The Simpsons (actually, the Simpsons uses a LOT of Kubrick references). Essentially, a trip through mankind, from cavemen to the then future (skipping out everything in between) 2001 treats us to a visionary and audio spectacle that's really hard to compare to anything else. I mean, the plot can go a million ways.. Is this about the beginning of man conquering inventions and the end, when the inventions conquer man (or at least attempt to?) Is it about God's work and how he controls our destiny? (enter black monolith here?) or is it just one big psychedelic fantasy?Dare I say all of the above?",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Masterpiece for All Time,"Others have written very detailed responses to this film. I simply need to state that this is like no other mainstream studio film ever made. It has been truly said (I'm sorry I can't remember by whom) that Kubrick here created the first true ""motion picture"" in the most literal sense of those words. You don't ""watch"" this one the way you would watch any other movie. You have to immerse yourself in it, open your mind completely to the visual images, and forget about following the plot or the banal dialogue. Almost all the truly important information and even more, ideas, come through the visuals. I've watched this film in excess of 100 times, and still find more and more in it with every viewing. Very few films can ever claim to be that intense, that deep, that rewarding.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Greatest Film of AllTime,"This film brilliantly visually depicts and answers the questions regarding who we are, why we are here and what is life really about. It's hilarious reading the negative reviews of those who are too shallow and plain stupid to understand the important messages of this masterpiece film. I'm pretty sure these clueless people are going through life with no grasp of reality or purpose. They intellectually are on the level of the monkeys in this film and don't even realize it. Suffice to say self awareness, patience and ability to logically and rationally understand the meaning of this film are beyond their brainpower. These people probably love to watch the absolute garbage and simple minded films produced by the Hollywood of the 21st Century. Unrealistic razzle dazzle special effects, foul dialogue, graphic violence, unprincipled characters and comic book level plots are what they have been conditioned to enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It is a metaphor  for the humans' place in the universe,"The movie is challenging to the mind. It is not about space flights. All parts of the movie are one story, one big picture. I would say it is about programming. The ""so called monolith"" is not a material thing, it is a program. It is like a universal programming rule: something is programming A, A is programming B  R is programming our SUN, SUN is programming humans, humans are programming HAL. The objects are programmed in order to complete a task. Once the task completed (or the programmed object is becoming dangerous to the programmer) the object is discarded. If you have a curious mind, you will find in this movie very important principles that human's program is based on; like complex patterns of 0 (avoiding suffering) and 1 (achieving pleasure), need for self expansion and achieving a goal. Interestingly, Kubrick emphasized the correlation between the humans program and space objects of the solar system, especially Moon (subconscious everyday life reactions) and Jupiter (expansion). EVERY detail in this movie has a meaning.Kubrick intentionally used quite a lot of visual and sound effects affecting human's brain and not in a subtle way. That's why some people are complaining about noises and ""LSD-induced images"" while others are loving the movie even though most o them have no idea what it is about.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Truly...a masterpiece,"Over the years, many, many words have been written and said about the 1968 Stanley Kubrick opus, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, but after re-watching it, there is only 1 word I would write about it...MASTERPIECEI have a long history with this film. My father took me to it as a 7 year old. I was intrigued by the Sci-Fi special effects, but mostly liked the monkeys at the beginning. I then saw it again as a college student in the early 1980's and was ""really into"" (for obvious reasons) the psychedelic special effects at the end. Later...in the early 1990's, during my Arthur C. Clark phase, I read the book and then re-watched the film and my understanding of what was happening on the screen gelled and, consequently, my fascination and respect for the themes and scope of 2001 opened up new doors of understanding. I think I have seen it another 4 or 5 times since then and have appreciated it in different ways each time.For this viewing, I walked away with a sense of awe of the sheer craftsmanship and audacity that Kubrick put up on the screen. The scope of the project in 1968 was (I'm sure) daunting with a subject matter that was just outside of normal vision, so for Kubrick to get a studio to o'k this film is mind-boggling to me.But...how does it stack up as a film? Very well, indeed.Told in 4 parts, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY tells the tale of mankind's evolution from ape-man to space explorers and the mysterious, monolithic aliens who help mankind advance along this line.In the hands of the great Stanley Kubrick, 2001 dazzles with pure visionary visuals, exploding heretofore unseen images on the screen. Showing us what could be possible in outer space visuals (not just paper plates hung on a wire against a star background). The film is full of Kubrick hallmarks - meticulously staged and choreographed scenes, stark colors - mostly one color with a dab of another color across the screen, and long scenes where not much dialogue takes place, but what is said (or not said) in the pauses speaks volume. Some would call this type of film making boring (and I have accused other filmmakers who have attempted this as boring and pretentious), but in the hands of Kubrick, this film is mesmerizing and continuously fascinating.The first 20 minutes of the film - the DAWN OF MAN portion - and the last 20 minutes - the JUPITER AND BEYOND THE INFINITE portion - are both dialogue-free. Kubrick let's the action and visuals speak for themselves. In between are THE MOON portion, which really serves as the audience introduction into the style and substance of the film, the wonderfully, Oscar winning special effects set upon a backdrop of classical music (who can hear Also sprach Zarathustra and not think of 2001)?It is during the 3rd - and most famous - portion of this film that a viewer will either engage or disengage with this film. This is the famous HAL 9000 portion of the film where 2 astronauts end up battling with a increasingly unstable artificial intelligence on a journey to Jupiter. It is here where Kubrick, I feel, is at his best. The long, uncomfortable silences and the glances between the two astronauts (played wonderfully by the oft-praised Keir Dullea and the underrated Gary Lockwood) leads to a sense of dread that is very reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock at his finest.I will admit that this film is not for everyone - and more than 1 of you reading this will attempt to watch 2001:A SPACE ODYSSEY and fall asleep during the middle of it - but for those of you that can plug into what Kubrick was achieving here will be rewarded with a very rich, very fascinating and very GOOD film that will garner conversation and criticism for many, many years to come.Truly...a masterpiece.Letter Grade: A+10 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the true great film classics of all time.,Not only unique for its time but one of the greatest Science fiction films of all time. Made without CGI on a very lean budget in today's adjusted figures. Stanley Kubrick made this film without the high shooting ratio he normally has. Stanley Kubrick is without doubt the greatest director in History thus far.This film was cut from five hours to two hours and twenty minutes and the art direction was superb.Stanley Kubrick and the great Aurthur C. Clarke collaborated to write this time less classic.Aliens a special message on Earth at the dawn of Human Kind and one on the Moon which modern man finds .Finally Humans accompanied by the most advanced computer ever made set of to Jupiter the find the next monumental message which turns out to be a gateway.Any one who studied film and/or wishes to be a part of the film industry or just enjoy great films must experience this film .If you don't like it then you belong to Bollywood or your a true Aussie.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""Take a stress pill and think things over""","Since its release in 1968, this has been a movie which divides its audience into lovers and haters. Sometimes (often?), those who love it will dismiss those who hate it as simply ""not getting it"". This attitude is not only snobbish, it maybe even misses the point of the picture. 2001: A Space Odyssey is not really a picture that one must ""get"". Its plot is not exactly labyrinthine, and while its meaning is obscure it is deliberately so, as Kubrick himself shied away from being philosophically explicit. In other words, if someone tells you they know what Kubrick was trying to say with the movie, they are wrong.So what exactly is the problem then? Contrary to what some might assume, it is not the slow pace of the picture that I find alienating. Certainly there are dozens of pictures with faster paces and shorter runtimes that I find far more boring because they are unconvincing, too wordy or just generally poorly executed. In fact it is the methodical pacing that gives Space Odyssey many of its best points. Take the early scenes with the apes - not a shot is wasted there. It is in fact an extremely efficient summary of the brutal and dangerous lives of these creatures, all told with an atmospheric quietness, building up to the eeriness of the monolith's appearance and the stylised bone-smashing scene. The following spaceship sequence, ""choreographed"" to the Blue Danube waltz is graceful, balletic and quite beautiful to behold. Later, the scenes with HAL and Keir Dullea become a kind of space horror, with the long shots and mechanical noises adding to the creepiness. There's also great tension built up by having the scenes of Dullea trying to get back on board through the airlock played out in painstaking real-time. And it is the achingly slow process of HAL being shut down that helps to make it such an intensely poignant sequence.So 2001: A Space Odyssey is, for the most part, an expertly rhythmic motion picture, and from its rhythm comes its power and its emotion. Where the problem comes, and I think the point where most of the audience is lost, is in the final act. When we are sitting through a ten minutes of lights zooming past, colour-filtered landscapes, and weird avant-jazz noises, the picture has lost its sense of aesthetic beauty, and gone into the realms of artistic pretension. No-one can really enjoy this sequence. Some might claim to ""appreciate"" it, and yet it is clearly a tonal piece with little actual meaning, so there is nothing really intellectually pleasing about it either.I have to admit though, a lot of my dislike for this picture is only relative to the adulation lavished upon it by its fans. It irks me that the match-cut with the bone and the spaceship is so widely applauded, when there is an almost identical (and far neater) cut in the Powell and Pressburger picture A Canterbury Tale, and besides there are better (but more subtle) match-cuts in Space Odyssey, such as the one from the monolith against the sky to the shadow on the plain. And I'm a little cynical about the fuss made over the scientific accuracy of the space flight stuff, when the picture is so unscientific about Darwinian evolution. Don't get me wrong; I'm not citing the match-cut or the scientific inconsistencies as problems in themselves, only pointing them out as examples of the sometimes misguided way in which this movie is seen as being exceptional. Perhaps then what 2001: A Space Odyssey suffers from is its own reputation. Considered in itself, the picture has a great deal to love about it and only a little to hate.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
You could argue that this film was an accomplishment of special effects in 1968. So What?,"Sure, the special effects of this movie were pretty good, even in the year 1968, but c'mon, what else is there to give it praise for? The movie was overlong, boring and made absolutely no sense. I didn't find myself caring for any of the characters, it was horribly directed by Stanley Kubrik and was a poor execution. Call me contemporary, but I like a film where there is a little dialogue, not a complete hour of total silence. I have lots of patience when it comes to film (I enjoyed Citizen Kane, Casablanca and There Will be Blood) but I found this film to be super overrated and shouldn't even be on IMDb's Top 250 List. The Even if they cut an hour, this movie would've and could've been way better. I also heard that Stanley Kubrik cut about 20-30 minutes to make the pacing faster. What pace? It took 2 and a half hours to tell an hour long story. I would sometimes fast forward and I would find that I missed nothing. You'll notice I didn't mention anything about the acting. That's because there was little acting. The only thing we see is actor's expression and small amount of dialogue. The only reason I gave this movie 3 stars is for the HAL storyline. That is the only interesting part of the film. And if you're going to give this film a 10 simply because it has great special effects, then give a 10 to Avatar and Star Wars (OK Star Wars may deserve it, but you get the idea). This film proves that special effects cannot save a film that has horrible directing and a painfully slow story. If any, this is a film that is only for hard core Sci-Fi buffs. Anyone else will be bored completely out of there heads without a fast forward button handy.",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
OPulent and pretentious but stylish space sci-fi kitch,"HAL is the early prototype of common day AI. Fortunately, one of the crew members manages to short-circuit this evil computer monster. After that, the space station steers towards the unknown. So good for the film's suspence, even if the trill is not just overblown but also in the long run a bit boring. But stylish, as I said. Sci-fi and therefore per definition kitsch. What does it need to be done well for? Science fiction = scientific fiction, a grave contradiction.The soundtrack in the overly pretentious pseudo-Darwinistic opening sequence combines the one classical composer ""Strauss"", Richard Strauss, composer of ""Thus spoke Zarathustra) with another Strauss, Joh. Strauss with theuse of ironical ""The beautiful blue Danube""-walz. Well, ""Zarathustra"" and ""waltzer-Strauss"" - and the two Strauss weren't even related!An anacronistic monolith in the desert looks like something between Trump Tower and Manhattan Chase Bank headquarters in New York City - Darwin's monkeys throw boomerangs (that desert must therefore be in Australia). The surreal journey in time and space, created on the basis of the real life Apollo journey to the Moon in the same year, 1969), ends up with a ridiculously high-pitched LSD-like pwycodelic grande finale. 70 mm Technicolor Luxury - what a waste! Kubrick's best films from my point of view are some of those in B/W. Space Odyssey is not the thightest told Kubrick-film, but visually beautiful.This space movie was a favouirite of the tech freak Classical music conductor Herbert von Karajan.For the opening fanfares of Richard Strauss' ""Also sprach Zarathustra"", Kubrick has happiily chosen Karajan's state of the art sound recording from 1964 with the Vienna Philharmonic, only surpassed by the Berlin recording from 1970.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Wow!,"I remember seeing this quite young in the theatres and even though I did not understand it - I was blown away by so many of the sequences. The art direction and the special effects in space were stunning for their time. I now own a copy of the film and every now and then I just put it in the VCR and it doesn't matter where it is, I just watch and am blown away by the consummate film-making. Kubrick was a film genius who made great films (Paths Of Glory, 2001) admirable ones (Barry Lyndon) and messes (Eyes Wide Shut, Shining, Lolita). I just showed Paths of Glory to my wife for the first time and man, what an amazing film about war and madness and cowardice amongst officers.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Cosmic Grandeur,"I have got to say that it is one of the best films ever made. It is a visual symphony. This would go down in the history as a treasure. You could spend a billion dollars, hire the finest directors, scour through hundreds of books for material, design the unprecedented special effects and set pieces and attempt to create a wonder like this, but I bet it I would still be a challenge so formidable, such as to be so sensually and philosophically and technically gratifying as this movie.The movie starts with the dawn of man on a desert landscape about 2million years ago. The ape-make up is too realistic to believe they were actually actors. The mystery starts when a black monolith appears to the apes and they somehow learn to use tool for kill prey for food, thus the transformation of ape in to man. This premise was wonderful and the background score (György Ligeti's Requiem) for this monolith was terrific. From the perfect shape of the monolith it is implied that it came from an alien intelligence for the purpose of transforming intelligent life.Then comes the famous match cut to a space ship 2million years later. And then comes arguably one of the most beautiful scenes ever seen in a movie, with the Blue Danube waltz (by John Strauss II) multiplying the effect; the dramatic docking of the space ship with space station and the voyage to the moon. The decor used in the space ships are splendid and the costumes of the actors were apt. The moon landscapes made me crave for moon, something which never even the Apollo landing pictures did for me. The black monolith appears again to the visitors at site on the moon implying that there is going to be an extraordinary leap of human intelligence. The radio waves form the monolith seems to point towards the Jupiter and so the mission to the Jupiter commences. HAL 9000, the computer which runs the ship for the mission to Jupiter was particularly terrifying in its tone of voice and the scary close up of it. The scene where HAL reads the lips is shown magnificently by turning the camera alternately between Bowman and Poole. In the end part the monolith appears again taking the space ship thru a kind of worm hole into another kind of world. The climax is philosophical and open for many interpretations.Many complain the slowness of the movie, but it is what that really did it for me. The director of the film, Stanley Kubrick is a genius. I have loved his other movies, Dr.Strangelove, Paths of Glory, Barry Lyndon, Full Metal Jacket, the director never wavered in sculpting absolute pieces of art, any person could dream of. The extraordinary thing I felt about the director is the way he can take the most complicated subjects and interpret it through his extraordinary vision.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A giant leap,"Kubrick's monolithic mid-period masterpiece is as remarkable as much for what it has NOT influenced in sci-fi filmmaking as what it has. So while special effects took a giant leap in 1968 (thanks in no small part to Douglas Trumball, who would give us a grim new world in 1982 with Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, the original ending to which made use of a series of helicopter shots lent by a certain Mr Kubrick), to this day we still have the sounds of swooshing of ships and zapping lasers in the vacuum of outer space. Then there is also the small matter of awe. Other than Andrei Tarkovsky's Solaris, it's hard to think of another example of a science fiction movie with such an unflinching commitment to spiralling wonder.And to think it all came from a (very) short story named The Sentinel - a tall tale about a pyramid-shaped creation half-buried on a Moon populated with ""degenerate plants"". (Well, it was written over 20 years before humans set foot on the thing.) Kubrick and Clarke's screenplay plonks this lunar discovery into the second act of a four-act epic. Long before that there is early, ape-like Man. The mysterious monolith appears to the Moon-Watcher and his flock, perhaps signalling the birth of religion. Jump-cut a couple million years (as you do) and the age of technology reigns - so Man is able to detect a magnetic anomaly on the Moon, which leads Heywood Floyd (William Sylvester) to our species' second audience with the strange black block. It's pointing toward Jupiter. So begins the third act, wherein astronauts Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Poole (Gary Lockwood) set sail for the great Red Eye, along with their infallible red-eyed companion, HAL, who represents the pinnacle of Man's technological endeavour. Paradoxically HAL also represents the limitations of technology, inadvertently highlighting the need for Man to transcend his current form. This paves the existential way for the final act, which sees Bowman enter a Jovian Stargate and undergo an exhilarating process of accelerated self-actualization. And then... well, my personal belief is that the final frame is the most profound image in cinema.No, in art.Clarke and Kubrick surround their characters with the clinical environment of technology, almost to the point of fetish - what delightful convenience, what intricate design! - only to strip it all away in the final reel, where some kind of apotheosis occurs in a cosmic hotel room decorated in the design of pre-electronic Earth. Luminous floor aside, we could be back in the time of Enlightenment.Much has been made of the technological prescience of Kubrick and co-writer Clarke. There is Heywood's video call to his daughter (Vivian Kubrick, who would go on to make the documentary The Making of The Shining, as well as score Full Metal Jacket). But look closer and you'll also notice that the screen is FLAT. And what are those contraptions Bowman and Poole use to watch the news on BBC 12? They look an awful lot like a certain popular tablet computer...This was 1968, remember.It's easy to throw around words like ""pompous"" and ""pretentious"" when viewing conceptual art. Clearly, if a viewer finds it does not affect them on an emotional level, then the natural defence is to attack the intentions of the artist. In the case of 2001: A Space Odyssey, not unlike the National Socialist Party's (mis)appropriation of Nietzsche's ""Ubermensch"", it is possible to read the Starchild as a god figure, or perhaps a blandly consoling religious promise of what is to become of us beyond our corporeal suffering. This is a perfectly reasonable interpretation, if argued intelligently. The key word here is ""interpretation"", made possible by the bold ambiguity of the text. Fanboy gushing and angry backlash are rendered equally irrelevant in the presence of the wellspring of true debate. Love it or hate it, 2001: A Space Odyssey has substance enough to furnish conversations for centuries to come.For all its grandeur and its intellectual rigidity, this is a warm, often amusing, deeply human film: a celebration of Man's practically infinite synaptic potential.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Contributions of a genius,"Watching this masterpiece that has been released one year before the moon landing, just made me realize what a genius Director could ever mean. Leading directors of his age, and other big names in cinema industry later on, Stanley Kubrick must be considered as one of the most influential directors of all time.Starting with Christopher Nolan and his Interstellar (2014) the movie that has taken 2001 as the main reference, had an amazing similarity with it, that didn't stop at the story line, but it continued to include many other points in my opinion, as the cadence of the main soundtrack (which was one of the best movie themes ever) that Hans Zimmer has played the same of it in most of interstellar's soundtracks especially ""No Time For Caution"", which I believe it all came out of Nolan's instructions. Beside some other cinematographic techniques as the complete silence in those scenes taken outside of the ship in both movies. Even in the appearance of the place Dr. Dave (the main character in 2001) has reached after entering the star gate, with the one Cooper has reached in Interstellar. So did Gaspar Noé praised in his last movie Love 2015 in the words of his main character Murphy who considers 2001 as the best movie he's ever seen and as the reason he wanted to be a director in the first place. There was even A Clockwork Orange (1971) Book seen in Murphy's room. This Kubrick influence could be seen again in Noé's movie Enter the Void (2009) in the long colorful illusions scenes.Kubrick ideas have also been involved in many kinds of movies even in animation as The Simpsons Movie (2007), and Pixar's Wall-E (2008), and many other memorable movies.Watching Kubrick works would totally let you see how he was the godfather for many directors these days. I've mentioned only two of them, but the list includes many other big names as I said before.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Overrated,"That is enough! Somebody should say ""the king is naked"". This film is very overrated and even some people who havent watched the film say that it is the best film ever, which i disagree (You see how they effect people? When you dont like the film, they will say you dont understand the art)Though i have no problem with slow going movies, this film is something different from slow going and too much boring. 
All right, i can understand that it was something new for filmmakers in those years, but it doesnt mean that it is the best movie in history when we compare it with real masterpieces like Godfather, Schindler's List, etc. 
If you want to watch better works of Kubrick, give a chance to films like The Shining and Full Metal Jacket. 6/10 according to me...",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Beauty is the word,"2001: A Space Odyssey is a 1968 science fiction film by Stanley Kubrick (who happens to be my favourite director as well). Being my favorite film, I have recommended this it to almost everyone I know. This review is more like an answer to those who found this film slow-paced, and for those yet to watch it, you may continue to read this as a disclaimer to the film- I'll give you a word- Beauty Beauty is an under-rated concept. Sure, you'll often see nice photography and so on in films. But when did you last see a film that contains beauty purely for the sake of it? There is a weird belief among cinema-goers that anything which is not plot or character related must be removed. This is depressing hogwash. There is nothing wrong with creating a beautiful sequence that has nothing to do with the film's plot. A director can show 15 minutes of spaceships for no reason than that they are beautiful, and it is neither illegal nor evil to do so.'2001′ requires you to watch it, in a different way than you normally watch films. It requires you to relax. It requires you to experience strange and beautiful images without feeling guilty that there is no complex plot or detailed characterization. Don't get me wrong, plots and characters are good, but they're not the be-all and end-all of everything. There are different kinds of film (this being the best of all), and to enjoy '2001′ you must tune your brain to a different wavelength and succumb to the pleasure of beauty, PURE beauty, unfettered by the banal conventions of everyday films.'2001′ is primarily a technical film. The reason it is slow, and filled with minute details because the aim was to realistically envision the future of technology (and the past, in the awe inspiring opening scenes including an amazing jump cut sequence). The film's greatest strength is in the details. Remember that when this film was made, man still hadn't made it out to the moon but there it is in 2001, and that's just the start of the journey. To create such an incredibly detailed vision of the future that 35 years later it is still the best we have is beyond belief – I still can't work out how some of the shots were done.The film uses invisible but powerful forces to manipulate the plot but perhaps the most overwhelming one is the picture's vision of man In Kubrick's fantasy, the Golden Age of man was a neglected instant between a man-ape's exaltation at discovering the first weapon and a nuclear-powered spaceship floating in a graceful orbit around the Earth. Man has indeed evolved As a spectacle ""2001″ assaults the mind, eye and ear, with stimulating images and suggestions. We are surrounded by a totally believable futuristic environment.The film is filled with brilliant sequences and extraordinary moments: The first interesting minutes in which the story of the apes is told visually, without a single line of dialog; the zero-gravity toilet with its great list of instructions; the stewardess defying gravity by walking the walls calmly upside down; the frightening moment when we realize that HAL is reading the astronauts lips; the magical alignments of Sun, Moon, and Earth; the ""Starchild"" returning home to charm the orb. ""2001″ is filled with poetic imagery: the view of the Sun rising over the Earth; the tossing of the bone into the air in slow motion; the slow images of the giant spaceship revolving in a cosmic ballet. ""2001″ is also a work of great visual acuity. It allows us to view more than the mystery of existence and destiny implicit in every man. Its end troubles many viewers as they demand clarity where there can only be mystery. They insist upon an answer where there can only be a question. Every viewer had a different explanation of the mysterious end of Kubrick's film. But for those who can accept mysticism, the climax is deeply moving.""2001″ is unique among films in content and scope. The cinematography is out-of-this-world, the special and visual effects are breathtaking, and the classical music is sublime. Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is art in the highest sense, like Leonardo da Vinci's ""Mona Lisa"", or Van Gogh's ""The Starry Night"". It is actually more than that!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great but long and dated,"Arthur C. Clarke said ""If you understand 2001 completely, we failed. We wanted to raise far more questions than we answered."" And 2001 did just that, a wonderful special movie that was way a head of its time in story, music and special effects. Stanley Kubrick had a bad habit of making long movies that meandered and needed to be cut some and 2001 was one of those movies, as a child when I saw this movie the great scenes were great but the boring scenes were very very boring and now as an adult I have not changed that thought. This movie was great for it's time but now coming up on 2001 it is badly dated",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
2001: A Space What?,"This movie contained fantastic special effects. By all means you should watch the effects in this movie. But don't feel bad about skipping over the plot. You would just have to google an explanation later anyway. That said, I don't think this movie deserves less than 3 stars, simply for the fact that it is a beautifully shot film. you have to remember that these special effects were made before anyone set foot on the moon. I found myself longing for more dialogue, but was enjoying the movie until I realized (12 minutes from the end of the movie) that there was simply not going to be an explanation of anything I had just watched. I literally fell asleep during the psychadellic dimensional travel sequence and woke up before it was over. Some of the shots are way too long.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Vertigineux,"Kubrick is for me the most eclectic of directors, with unique and inimitable films.2001 a Space Odyssey has as its main flaw its title. It is indeed quite reductive compared to the film. But, the choice is perhaps the expression of Kubrick's modesty in not wanting to pronounce more than this on the substance of the film. Because the film has a certain unattainable philosophical ambition.The other flaw of the film, which we cannot blame Kubrick for, is that it is difficult to access. On the form, with lengths and little dialogue. And on the substance: ""but what does this film want to say?""So, on the philosophical ambition, there are surely explanations for this, on the part of Kubrick or Clarke. Personally, if the plot is ultimately clear and even very simple: the access of human civilization to knowledge symbolized by the monolith, the conclusion is without answer, voluntarily. And logically! Kubrick is not the type to be pretentious about anything beyond his knowledge. Nor that of wanting to make a commercial film with a clear and understandable path.That being said, despite the lengths and silences, the film is very well thought out with of course the two flagship parts of the film: the trip in the shuttle with HAL and the final journey.Needless to say, things were well thought out, aesthetically and technically. These are, it seems to me, two essential characteristics of Kubrick, a photographer at heart. And a perfectionist!This film is therefore a (difficult) masterpiece to savor with all the senses but especially not to spoil with a thorough analysis.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Unique, Memorable, Trippy, Relaxing, Slow, Abstract, One of a kind.","This movie is very interesting because you've never seen anything like this in the year 68, so professional, so colorful, so impressive, and different. It might be the slowest movie you've ever seen, but, u can tell that it was intentionally made like that. I'ts like a journey in space that u follow along with. It's a very trippy and relaxing movie, although I don't do drugs, this is the type of movie that u can watch while high on weed, shrooms, or LSD. The music is very memorable and iconic, and used brilliantly. It's amazing to see such an old movie be visually pretty. U won't ever forget the evolution scene, The computer, The music, and the Abstract ending that was made for u to interpret on your own. That's what makes it special. The dialogue was nothing special, but u can tell it wasn't the focus of the film. There wasn't much of it, The biggest character was the computer. This movie is meant to be artistic, it shows off how well they made it look like a much much newer movie. The ending was made for u to interpret, so this movie can really make u feel like you're a part of it all! I feel like if u like good abstract art, you're gonna enjoy this masterpiece film. This movie also predicts a lot of future inventions. Makes it even harder to believe that the moon landing was one year after this film, after all, it's easier to fake it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An historical milestone,"As far as meaning, significance and cultural instigation are concerned, 2001 features innumerable referential approaches: to mankind, to God (and/or to the Demon), to the future, to our responsibility as of 1968 as we faced new realities; to the rediscovery of language; to the brand-new systems of knowledge; to the man-vs. -machine struggle. Stanley Kubrick directed this iconic film, in which mankind finds a mysterious, obviously artificial object buried beneath the Lunar surface and, with the help of an intelligent computer HAL 9000, sets off on a quest. Hal is error-proof - his ontology is infallibility. (And Nota bene the homophone pun: Hal is pronounced as hell. Beforehand, during the Paleolithic period, primates faced the mechanics of their primitive, primary life, and their capital objective = simple resistance, at a biological level. Those mankind precursors were not yet fully superior to other animals because they did not have the capacity for symbolic communication; they only communicated through signals. They mastered no connotative capacity at all, only some kinda denotative capacity. Their booming intellect was still impotent for making abstractions. Then an immense, polished, geometric, rectangular monolith, - the revelation of the newly coming Neolithic revolutionized universe (the Polished stone Era) - and subsequently the discovery of the media and the instruments - extensions of our physical members. The unknown monolith is almost an apparition of God. Also the germ of thought. The ape-man assaults the skeleton of a dead animal, picks up a bone (which had previously been used as a weapon to win the battle for a water pool ), begins to brand it euphorically, while disrupting the skeleton, throwing it up in the air and - incidentally the greatest anecdotal ellipse in the history of cinema: - and the bone fuses into a 2001 spaceship, sliding through the imponderable silence of the cosmos, to the sound of Johann Strauss' Blue Danube. The phenomenon is then repeated: the monolith is found on the moon, and the astronauts who approach it exhibit a similar behavior to that of the primates, when they touch it. An expedition to Jupiter, with three crew members in hibernation, only to be restored to their vital faculties when they arrived at the destination, the other two alive, and the electronic computer (Hal), leading the ship. Kubrick & Arthur C Clarke conceived the behavior of the Cyclops-eye machinery by, say, matching Homer's Odyssey. Something like Hal may indeed become reality and be capable of own emotions and mental initiatives. There resides the impasse for mankind, with its philosophical implications.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Odyssey Explained,"Central to 2001 is man's evolutionary bond with the tool, or what later develops into human technology. 2001 begins in prehistoric Africa, focusing on a tribe of apes struggling for survival. Following the mysterious appearance of a large black Monolith, apparently of alien origin, the apes give birth to what is the film's paramount symbol, and what the film suggests is the key to humanity's dominance over nature--the tool. This is clearly depicted when the ape playing in a heap of bone remains learns the destructive power of the bone. The camera zooms in on and tracks the bone after the ape hurls it into the air to convey that this is birth of humanity as we know it. The apes have gone from mildy successful scavengers into weapons-making hunter-gatherers that eventually dominate their planet. Also, Kubrick's message in this segment of the film is that the qualities of the apes themselves, and not the intervention of the Monolith, are responsible for the apes' revolutionary discovery. Almost immediately, the film moves forward millions of years, to the point where the tool has evolved into a massive network of technology that gives man complete control of the Earth. Now, mankind seeks to dominate the cosmos.During this part of the film, tangible characters are introduced and Kubrick takes his audience on a tour of the power of man and his technology. Kubrick has another point to make during this section: man's weakness in space. Stewardesses aboard a shuttle must use gravity shoes to walk; passengers are shown eating through tubes; and another sequence depicts lengthy instructions on how to use a zero-gravity toilet. Kubrick's motive behind these scenes? To demonstrate that humans are somewhat over their heads in space, suggesting that their weakness could lead to a challenge to their dominance.As the film progresses, the modern humans discover the Monolith deliberately buried under the surface of the Moon, emitting a signal toward the far reaches of the solar system. The discovery prompts the film's major sequence, a manned space voyage to Jupiter, for reasons undisclosed to the viewer. The first developing and round characters emerge during this part of the movie, including mission commander Dr. David Bowman.Kubrick also introduces another major character--HAL, a talking computer that controls most of Discovery's operations, including the duty of monitoring crewmen placed aboard in hibernation. HAL essentially represents the pinnacle of man's technological achievement, and inevitably embodies the film's principal antagonistic element. The HAL computers have a perfect operational record, and are considered ""incapable of error."" However, Kubrick's space drama begins when HAL makes an incorrect prediction regarding the failure of Discovery's antenna, causing Dr. Bowman and his assistant, Dr. Frank Poole, to question HAL's stability and competence. Thus creates the film's cardinal conflict, and a monumental battle between man and his tools ensues.Kubrick again subtly suggests human weakness in space, this time through the use of sound. In two separate segments that occur while the humans are outside the ship and floating in space, the only audible noise is the assisted breathing of Bowman and Poole within their helmets. This suggests that man is like a fish out of water in space, and computers have no need to breathe. The battle between man and his technology begins when HAL decides that the human crew might endanger his mission, murders the hibernating crewmen, and launches Dr. Poole spiraling into space. But HAL isn't as perfect as he claims, as suggested by his inaccurate prediction of the antenna's failure. Dr. Bowman, the last remaining survivor of HAL's murderous plot, manages to infiltrate the ship after HAL attempts to lock him out, and manually disconnects HAL using the simplest of man's tools-the screwdriver.In the final segment of 2001, Kubrick's sci-fi epic takes a mind-boggling turn as Dr. Bowman reaches Jupiter, where the alien forces behind the Monolith have led him. Kubrick uses an inventive and stunning sequence of vibrant lights and colors to illustrate Bowman's journey into the unknown, leading him and the viewers to a strange room. The room becomes Kubrick's irrational stage for the final act of the film, where Bowman must confront a final test--his own death. Kubrick uses no narration nor dialogue to progress the plot, instead he simply challenges the audience to grasp his conclusion. However, Kubrick does consummate 2001 with a definite ending. Dr. Bowman ends man's evolutionary bond with the tool, and becomes the Starchild, a being of pure energy. Like the tool, this is just the next major step in man's evolution. Again, the alien forces are not responsible for this change. Instead, they merely directed man where to go and set the stage for him.This film is a marvelous concoction of science and fantasy, and is truly rewarding for viewers familiar with its subject matter. All of us should be intellectually stimulated by it, but tragically, that probably will never be.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Read the book - it's a lot better,"Despite the fact that the book and the script 2001 were written simultaneously, there is no point denying that the book is much better. It is a good film, yes, but there is one detail that I just can't get by: it is so horrendously SLOW.Other than that, it's a special film all right. Weird, esoteric and bizarre at some points, but nevertheless it manages to keep all the yo-ho Star Trek out - it's almost scientific in itself. As for the minor glitch of foreseeing space stations the size of cities and inhabited bases on the moon - well...I wouldn't citizise too far. Arthur C.

Seminal sci-fi classic that still amazes and beguiles.....,"After 15 years, I've finally managed to see '2001' after reading the book. I've no idea why it took me this long to get round to it but it was worth it only in that '2001' is the first film I've watched on Blu-ray and it has been excellent. The film is an existential look at man's possible place in the universe. Beginning at the dawn of man and jumping to the 21st Century, this film charts a theoretical look at man's evolution in progress.The film poses questions on man, space and being. How you are to decipher the whole film is really up to each individual. What makes us human? Are we truly as advanced as we think we are? Is there life elsewhere? Thought provoking questions each one, yet surprisingly not over burdened in the film. Putting a philosophical question in a movie can be asking for derision, as cries of pretentiousness abound. In '2001' the film is one of the few that manage to do it and actually be praised for it. The points are accessible by anyone.Viewers must also note that this was made before man went to the moon, so much of it is really analysis on space travel as well. That goes even down to the basic aspects (e.g. how do you do the toilet in space?).You will be intrigued and amazed by it all, and be sitting there at points figuring out how they made some of the scenes before CGI etc was ever around. The scene where the man is running around the circular shuttle is even now quite brilliant. You will be sitting there wondering how they did the scene (over to the DVD extras).One for repeat viewing, and one that can little ever be questioned to be nothing less than a seminal classic of all film making.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Revolutionary , Pioneer & Creativity in Space movies .. But Extremely boring and non sense","This is The most Boring Movie I've ever seen in my life .. Yes It's a major jump and maybe The first of its kind in space movies but it's only for its time . The Camera work is very good as well as the music . ( those are the good things )Why I don't like >> The factor of enjoyment and excitement is totally lost in the movie .. The events are too slow in progression and they aren't even related to each other in a descent way .. You seem to be watching more like a documentary than a movie to enjoy ,, I mean Come on where is even the story line ?!! Silence was overwhelming in an absolutely non justifiable way , Really !! 25 minutes to hear a word !! I started to think it was a silent movieThis is Kubrik's way always , I'm not a big fan of him by the way .. So I wasn't expecting much But I found much less than what I expected ,, I mean it's 2:28 hours movie all boring and for nothing !!

"NOT the Emperors New Clothes, more like Marmite","Some reviewers have called this a case of the Emperors New Clothes, in other words those who give it good reviews can't admit it's rubbish. Well I saw this back in the day when it was first released, a group of us skipped school and went up to the west end to see it in all it's Cinerama glory. I loved it then and every time I've seen it since, yesterday in fact, including the time after I discovered LSD (something I wouldn't recommend doing these days) the final sequence was awesome!So it's a bit like Marmite, you either love it or you hate it. So I accept some people find it boring but I wouldn't call them stupid, they just don't have the same tastes as I and the majority of reviewers here, do.I would guess that most who don't like it come from the Star Wars generation of CGI flash bang whollop kind of Sci-fi which needs not a a lot of thought to understand. The fact that spaceships can't fly at X time the speed of light without any effects on the crew is unlikely is not the point. 2001 is intelligent Sci-Fi where you need to draw your own conclusions as to the ending.The decision not to show any alien was a good one, all films of this genre have aliens that are basically humanoid, two legs, two arms and a head so that they can find actors to play the part with considerable changes to the head as the only concession to the possibility that any aliens would looks a bit different. Why do they always speak English with and American accent?Is it slow, I concede that point but then space travel would seem slow, it would take months to get to Jupiter so why would they show it as being faster? Slow yes, boring no.I've just watched it again 1.1.22 and stand by everything I've said, the best Sci Fi movie ever, nothing I've seen in the last few years have come close.I wouldn't insult you by saying you're stupid because you don't get it so don't insult me because I do.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"8.2/10 - Interesting in a Lot of Ways, Yet Undeniably Exhausting","*sigh*Okay, let me take this out of the way - this film isn't a masterpiece in my opinion. I do think that it has some qualities, and I find its idea quite interesting, but yet...kinda crazy to think that so many people consider it as one of the best films of all time.What is the plot, you ask? Well. This movie doesn't have much of a plot, you see. One can say that it's about a black monolith discovered on the moon and the team that was sent to research it. But this film's point isn't to keep you interested in a thrilling plot or whatever. The movie's goal is to give you a certain experience, to portray humanity and evolution in a certain way. It is a special film, I can give it that. It's like those weird, obscure asrtsy short films that you watch and then you're like ""wtf did I just watch"", but 2.5 hours of this.So, that's what I like about this film - the score is basically perfect and super iconic, the aesthetic is unique and interesting - it's a space film created one year before the first moon landing, so the way that people imagined the future back then is truly fascinating. I also like a lot of the ideas, metaphors and symoblism that goes on throughout the movie. It went totally over my head the first time, but I appreciated it way more the second time. So yeah, all of those things are pretty much fantastic, and the HAL 9000 computer is such an interesting character.However, this film has two huge problems, that in my opinion take away a lot from the better stuff on this film.The first thing is the pacing. I don't think that this film could be way shorter because of what it is, but it doesn't change the fact that this is, by far, the slowest movie I've ever watched. It may be truly boring from time to time, and tho some of the stuff that happens slowly is justified (like in the intro for the movie, The Dawn of Man part) and sometimes it's just unnecessery. And this film is 2.5 hours! Just to remind you.The secong thing is the heavy, heavy reliance on metaphors and symbols. At times, it feels like there's no much plot, only artsy and lengthy shots that should make you ask philosophical questions. And I'm really fine with symbolism and stuff like that - in fact, I really love things in that manner when it's done right. And here it's kind of the main point of this film - it's more philosophical and artsy than captivating plot-wise.These reasons are what makes this film so exhausting. Even people who love this film to death will agree with this statement most of the time. So, is it a fun film to watch? Hmm...at times, and if you get the metaphors and symbolism. Most of the time it's thought provoking, yet too slow and exhausting.It's still an interesting, well done film in a lot of ways, but it's far from being a masterpiece in my opinion. I'm feeling an 8.2/10 on this one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

2001: A Film Odyssey,"2001: A Space Odyssey was the first great Sci-Fi Film. It has it all- A.I, Spacesuits and Aliens. Although many contemporary audiences considerer this classic boring and dull, it certainly is entertaining if you understand it. It's not simply a story of Astronauts floating around in space, but more a story of the change of man, and how technology has changed.The Opening Scene, The Dawn of Man, is one of the greatest parts of this space epic. It shows how man was thousands of years ago, and how man discovered weapons. I personally don't believe in evolution, but I do find this scene very intriguing and is more a scene of the change of the mental capacity of man, not necessarily the psychical. This is the clever way that Stanley Kubrick makes the scene. He sets the scene up as more of a personal interpretation, rather than put the facts on screen.Overall, 2001 is a great film that defiantly makes you think about life and the change of man.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Apothetical.,"A stunning, spectacular, psychedelic, intense, and fascinating trip into outer space, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" remains not only the greatest science fiction film, but also one of, if not the, greatest films ever to grace our screens. I kid you not.Every shot is filled with beautiful scenery and effects (that are still impressive today), that will stimulate your mind and make you ask yourself the purpose of life. How? Why? You will have to see it to believe it. The best thing about this movie is that it is daring, DARING, to show such questions off in an abnormal manner towards an unexpected audience. ""Why are we here? How did we came to be? Are we creations of God? Are we our own God?"". Yes, it is as philosophical as they say.I am simply stunned at some other people's comments. Bored? BORED?! You say? Shocking. You are one of Hollywood's victims, watching most of their propaganda that either makes people joyfully glee or kicking each others' guts out with stupid comedy or political references shown in their films. No. Get a life. Watch this film. Ask yourself the meaning of life. Repeated viewings are required to get the full message. Each new viewing gives new questions and new answers. The slow pace of the film is necessary for you to absorb these questions and answers. Yes, this is a calling, told visually.What director Stanley Kubrick has done here is too good for mere words. He and co-creator Arthur C. Clarke became science fiction masters, right after this film, and it is easy to see from here. The film shows visually stunning sequences, mixed in with beautiful, harrowing and haunting music to create a spectacular, exquisite and wondrous event for the senses. This is not just any film, this is film art at its best.From the lavish set design that is all-too realistic, to the grim realization that it brings forth, this film is magical. A moment not to lose as you find yourself in the deepest chasms of outer space, from a space station to the deep end of Jupiter. Also, man's evolution is made evident with the Dawn of Man sequence, also masterfully interpreting primitive apes who use bones as weapons, then the famous ""jump cut"" shows a nuclear/laser satellite over the mid-air bone. Showing a ""weapon of mass destruction"" prophecy. It seems all too real now.Space exploration. The film was made in 1968, and is set in 2001. Although that time limit has come and pass, some, but not most, of the things shown in the film are not invented yet. It still shows that mankind still has a long way to go even after all those inventions and progresses, both in real-life and on the screen. The Final Frontier, as Star Trek would put it. Man may not conquer it. But we can experience its beauty.Technically speaking, it ticks all the boxes. The scope is wide. The effects are great. The cinematography is beautiful. The music is haunting. Keir Dullea's makes us feel for his character. The villainous HAL 9000 is cold and chilling to the bone, like the icy cold of space. The direction is mesmerizing. The script sublime. The shocks genuine. The chills up your spine it brings. The majesty of it all. Who am I kidding? Word's simply will not do this piece of art justice.If this does not gain a position in the Top 20, never mind the Top 250, I urge you movie fans out there to see this film. It's an absolute must. If you don't, consider yourself a liar if you claim that you're a fan of science fiction, movies, or art, whatever the cause. It's a film event that must be behold by all, told by a master filmmaker, who truly is one of, if not the, greatest filmmaker who ever lived.The film has inspired numerous films, like ""Star Wars"", ""Alien"", ""Blade Runner"", and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"". Even it's theme of questioning human existence is explicitly delivered in the almost-equally masterful anime franchise ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"", which I urge anyone to see if they liked this film. But really, this film is the great-granddaddy of them all. It shows science fiction in a serious light, and eroding any shred of camp value of the '40s and '50s.Forget George Lucas. Step aside, Steven Spielberg. Move over, Ridley Scott and James Cameron. Stanley Kubrick is The Man and you better believe it.People, this film is apothetical.Overall: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Technically and visually stunning,"""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is an extraordinary film and oh so significant. It must have been the pioneer of the science-fiction films and inspired later famous movies of its kind.Amazing and triumphant, it is also a completely different movie experience. Its formula is somehow similar to that of Walt Disney's ""Fantasia"", being a very artistic movie that focus more in art and images than dialogs, almost like a space documentary.Technically the movie is impressing and visually brilliant. The visual effects are stunning, the special effects are wonderful, the futuristic and advanced visuals are terrific and the attention to detail is not forgotten (even in the smallest details). This is pure and expressive art, combined with beautiful and unforgettable classical music.Speaking of classical music, Richard Strauss's ""Thus Spake Zarathustra"" theme is one of the movie's trademarks, but even better than this one is the fabulous Johan Strauss II's ""On the beautiful Blue Danube"" waltz.The ""Star Gate"" sequence is the most incredible, indescribable and breathtaking part of this movie. Wow, what a perfect and extraordinary genial artwork! The sound effects were not forgotten as well during the entire movie. The combination of sounds is great. It accents the already quite realistic atmosphere of the movie.""2001: A Space Odyssey"" also deals with interesting stuff such as the human evolution, extremely advanced technology, artificial intelligence and extraterrestrial life.One example of artificial intelligence is the HAL 9000 computer, with his «perfect reliability» and soft and distinctive voice (brilliantly voiced by Douglas Rain). HAL 9000 is a great villain, being even capable of reading lips, which he does in a brilliant close-up and silent scene.The only things I don't particularly appreciate in this movie is the sequence ""The Dawn of Man"" (with pre-historical apes, so fake and unnatural that it's obvious they're men disguised as apes) and I also dislike the final minutes of the movie (after the magnificent ""Star Gate"" sequence). However, ""The Dawn of Man"" also has its good things, such as the gorgeous sceneries, luminosity and that weird and somewhat sinister vocal music when the monolith appears.During the first 3 minutes, all we see is nothing - we only hear a strongly suspenseful music. The title sequence is wonderful, with a satellite image of the Earth rising over the Moon, while the Sun rises over the Earth, all in alignment, looking like an eclipse. More or less in the middle of the movie, there is an intermission that lasts 2 minutes and we hear the same strong music.If this is already a formidable movie, the fact of being from 1968 amazes me even more and makes its greatness even bigger. I mean, just imagine: this was made such a long time ago, when computers and technology were radically different and not even close to be half as developed and advanced as nowadays. It must have been completely unbelievable in 1968! However, this is a movie that requires an open mind and patience because it is long, slow and has very few dialogs, which may make it a bit tiring. But nobody discusses its greatness.Without a doubt, this is a cult movie, a timeless classic, one of all time's greatest science-fiction films (as well as one of all time's great movies) and Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, which was written by Arthur C. Clarke and Kubrick himself. As for the cast, talents include Keir Dullea, Gary Lockwood, Douglas Rain, William Sylvester and others.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A film of its time,"Viewing the film in Cinerama at Pictureville in Bradford West Yorkshire in the year 2001 was something to look forward to after only having seen the film on TV many years ago.I should have stuck to my memories, as the excellent new print and brilliant cinema could not compensate for a self indulgent and very dated film. I had forgotten just how boring it was and the magic of watching models rotate slowly to nice music has gone.The entry to Jupiter really dated the film in the 1960's and reminded me of the trip sequence in ""Easy Rider"". The opening ape sequence was reminiscent of ""Planet of The Apes"" though both films appeared in the same year so who borrowed what I know not.Having seen ""The Dish"" a few days previously, the magic and mystique of outer space does exist for me, but sadly not from this film so rooted in the 1960's",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Moreover, one is ultimarely left to determine what the hell this movie was even about, perhaps fearing to disclose this fact to avoid the glare of contempt by those brainiacs who claim to understand it. In truth those who claim to understand the underlying meaning of this film may not know what they're talking about and their attempts at explanation are mere expressions of speculative opinion that are on equal footing with those who fearlessly state that it makes no sense. In seekimg entertainment most of us would rather leave the theater with an degree of satisfaction as oppose to feeling like we were unprepared and flunked a snap quiz.

One of the greatest movies of all time.,"4/4 ESSENTIALI recently bought a movie ticket to see 2001: A Space Odyssey to celebrate it's 50th birthday. It was quite an experience, and it was my first time seeing the movie in IMAX. To say the very least, this viewing definitely incentivized me to review the movie. There is no other movie quite like Stanley Kubrick's 2001, and I can guarantee that there never will be.This is one of the few movies that deserves a viewing even if you have no remote interest in the plot. Kubrick directs a film that has a significant emphasis on the visuals and musical score, and it does so with his signature deliberation. The movie succeeds in being like a moving painting, you feel like you're in the presence of a movie that transcends the screen. This is somewhat of a lost art in modern day films.As far as the story, it's fairly simple: Astronauts find a monolith on the lunar surface of one of Jupiter's moons. Assisted by a super-computer by the name of HAL-9000, they set off on a space odyssey. While the plot doesn't present itself as anything remotely complex, this movie has a deeper message. The plot is simply the surface-level gateway to a metaphor that digs far below the surface. That's all I feel obligated to say about that.To say that I thoroughly enjoyed myself screening 2001: A Space Odyssey would be an understatement. It is a treat both in an visual and intellectual way, and none short of a true masterpiece.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Purely Brilliant! A True Masterpiece,"After watching this today, I have two words to describe this movie: Pure Masterpiece.I loved everything about the movie. The dialogue, the adventures, the segments. This movie is just pure dramatic. It was also kind of strange that a very old man in the ""Jupiter and Beyond The Infinite"" segment turned into a baby in a ball at the very end. It was just so spectacular, you would want to watch it again and again. The special effects were also great as well.I thought the classical music pieces of the movie just matched up really well with the scenes of the movie. I also often like to play ""Echoes"" from Pink Floyd while watching the final segment (I happen to be a lover of audio/video combinations). You can try it too. IF you have the album Meddle from Pink Floyd as well as this movie, turn on the mute before you get to the Jupiter and Beyond The Infinite segment. Set up Meddle and set to track 6 ""Echoes"" and pause before the third ping, then press play when the screen title comes up to Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite.For anyone (even if you're not a sci-fi fan), this is very highly recommended. My rating: 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Possibly the most important film of all time,"I first saw this movie in my 8th grade science class at Maple Grove Junior High. I found it to be the most absurdly boring and pointless movie I had ever had to sit through. I was young, I was naive, and I had a lot to learn...Now, upon second viewing, at age 24, it is easily, in my opinion, one of the most important films ever made. The story alone makes most other movies feel ant-like.There are movies that are made to please an audience, and there are movies that are made to be a piece of art. In my opinion, this just might be the absolute greatest piece of abstract art in the form of film to ever be created thus far.A few years ago when The Fountain came out, I thought I had seen the ultimate art film - but I had no idea what was sitting around the corner waiting for me with 2001: A Space Odyssey...From the moment the movie starts, you're abrasively attacked with banshee-esquire sirens and a pitch black screen - you have no idea what's happening, but you are becoming a victim of the movie's concept. From the very beginning, you are not only watching a movie, but you are a part of it. For the remainder of the following 140 minutes, you will very slowly but tastefully witness some of the most powerful moments that could ever be imagined in the history of mankind - from the dawn of time, to what is imagined as the possible end... and beyond.This is a movie that simply cannot be put into words. It's an abstract experience that everyone takes differently, unless of course you are a philistine, a non-intellectual, or if you simply have no interest in why or how we exist, then most likely you will take nothing from it at all.I can say, it is a movie in which when it was over, I had no idea what had just happened in the end. But that's one of the brilliant aspects of it. I have my ideas, I have my theories, and I still have plenty of questions. It leaves you hanging in the best way.I won't even go into it but this is certainly one of my new all-time favorites. I'll never forget the shot of the apes screaming at their confusing discovery for minutes upon minutes... after a few I began to get tense. I shot up and shouted with ascending volume, ""what the **** IS THAT THING?????!?!"" - that shot never leaves my head. And ""that thing"" is still the ultimate life mystery... or at least the best representation of it that I've ever seen.I can't wait to watch it again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of film history's brightest stars,"In hypothetical 2001 auteur-duo Stanley Kubrick and sci-fi master Arthur C. Clarke take us on a unique journey into the unknown, leading us far out into the vast reaches of space, where man is all alone with himself. Or is he? For an ominous artifact excavated on Earth's single natural satellite, the moon, seems to suggest otherwise. The enigma of the monolith beckons - and points further out there. What hides behind the glassy slab composed of the inkiest blackness imaginable? Is the monolith a relic from a long-lost cosmic culture? Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe it serves as a sentinel, an extraterrestrial guardian to evaluate intelligent life, an alien yardstick to measure civilization, to supervise its genesis and progress. Or is it closer to a teacher, providing man with the missing link to what lies beyond, a rung to hold on to, so that a sometimes floundering race may evolve beyond? Have we come across a gateway to a first encounter, to - who could know? - even something... divine? - Questions abound: Who created this inscrutable object? And why, after so many years of resting buried, has it been activated, signaling... where to? The answer might transcend comprehension and thus mankind as we know it. We have arrived in hypothetical 2001, the year when everything is about to change.Ambiguity is not ""2001's"" liability, but its forte. It is the main and heady ingredient Kubrick allowed to dominate Clarke's potent sci-fi cocktail of ultimate questions. Whereas the grand mysteries of life's origin and destiny are gradually diminished in Clarke's accompanying novel and even more so in the three succeeding books, Kubrick opts for a pure philosophical angle, studding it with iconic imagery. Ultimately, the viewer is left with facing the sublime alone; dropped right into the majesty that is the universe, on his way towards infinity. Visuals reign. Visuals supplemented by such diverse, seemingly contradictory soundscapes as György Ligeti's eerie ""Requiem"", Richard Strauss's epic ""Thus Spoke Zarathustra"", Johann Strauss's unforgettable ""Blue Danube"" waltz, and the sheer intensity of universe-wide eternal silence.Almost unfathomable that we have to remind ourselves that Kubrick put this masterpiece on celluloid based on pre-moon landing data. So accurate is his dedication to scientific accuracy that the conspiracy theories about him having staged the actual moon landing haven't let up till this day. Then again, how disappointing that post-Kubrick filmmakers have mostly given up on taking a leaf out of his book where space is married with science in supreme beauty; instead, they deliver lackadaisical CGI-infested crowd-pleasing imitations and, if they have to say something at all, they drench them in pseudo-intellectualism. Looking back, one has to grant at least the follow-up to the mother of all space operas, ""2010: The Year We Make Contact"" (Peter Hyams/Arthur C. Clarke), that it is not a bad film. And yet, for what it's worth, it already looked dated upon conception. While full of monoliths, it lacks all things Kubrick, which condemns it to a mere footnote to the seminal original. ""2001"" is more than a movie. It's an epiphany. Mankind's third millennium starts with ""2001"", date and film, and with good reason.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Not just a movie, a glimpse of the sublime.","Not just a movie, a glimpse of the sublime. One of the most beautifully crafted films I've ever seen. Sure it's slow but when the drama comes it pierces right to the bone. I've heard the philosophy behind the film criticised for being naff. I don't understand how people can say that. This film comes from the heart. It questions deeply: why are we here? what is the nature of consciousness? what does it mean to be human? I don't think it tries to answer these questions. Rather it stares right into the abyss of our existence and says YES, it's all worth it. Is this naff? Not to me. It's the most inspiring cinematic experience I've had so far.

"2001: A Space Odyssey  --  ""a never ending journey""","Written by a genius Arthur C. Clarke and directed by a genius Stanley Kubrick, 2001: a space odyssey is absolutely the CLASSIC of sci-fiction movie, one of the GREATEST film ever made!I am just 21 years old so sure I didn't sit in cinema and watch this movie in 1968. I just watched it few months ago. Impressive! It blows me away! If u think it is nothing as it is an old movie, you are totally WRONG.Awesome visual effect, amazing classical music are not enough to describe this film. The most successful way of it is its plot. In 1968, during its premier, handsome hunk actor Rock Hudson and few Hollywood colleagues walked out the theater without finishing this film, they said:""Can someone tell me what the hell it is about?""Until now, a lot of people still don't get it and push this movie aside from their consciousness. The theories of this film are so deep..deep until hard to see, or should say it is abstract. Also, it touch a issue that some god believer don't believe – evolution, and this film eventually delivers an idea about ""what is god"". I am not critiquing anyoneI watched it again with one of my friend who is so believe in god and he didn't refuse it.As a biologist, I believe in evolution as a gradually changing, a sort of cell-by-cell adaptation process across time. This film made some hypothesis in human evolution and starts an amazing and mystery journey in space.To understand this film, you have to imagine FREELY.

Solid cinematographic science fiction,"This film is unique and a very important influence for science fiction cinema.This film is very interpretive, which makes it very special and allows you to open your mind to develop and theorize the situations and events that are in the story, which is very different and reflects the creativity and originality of its creator, although it can be a little slow and it can stop a lot in the scenes, but that gives it a lot of realism and makes you feel like you're actually in space. Visually it's unique and spectacular, the use of practical visual effects and the way they look so real even though the technology wasn't that advanced at the time is something unique and not used to seeing nowadays, the sets are put together in an intelligent and very complete way, every detail is there, this makes the film feel very real. The music is fascinating, each moment has the perfect and memorable musicalization, functioning as one more character in the story, the character development is very complete. The beauty of this film is that you can interpret it as you want and create many theories that will be correct since this film is made for that, some of the things that this film represents are that technology can ruin us by abusing it so much, curiosity of the human being to know what there is in space is very great, and that this curiosity can lead us to our perdition or to transcend as a species, among other things. The production design is impressive and it really seems that you are in those places, the costumes are also very good and the conceptualization of the future is very successful since at present many things that the film exposes, today exist or are in the process of being created.It's a unique film, made with a lot of imagination but also with a lot of research and scientific precision, just like it's perfect in every cinematographic aspect there is and it's also a reference to all the science fiction movies that have been made since then, it's purely perfect.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Mind Bogglingly Brilliant,"I know there are others who despise this movie, and I can understand why. We're not all the same and therefore do not expect the same ""output"" from every movie we watch. Sometimes when I sit down to a movie, I don't just want to be entertained - I want it to ask me questions, to raise my curiosity and place my thoughts somewhere they haven't been before.2001 has been the ultimate in providing this. From the very beginning, ie. the ""black nothingness"", it is making you wonder, making you use your imagination, filling you with a mixture of hope and of dread. Kubrick was an intelligent director and wanted to make you ""add"" to the atmosphere of his films with your imagination. He couldn't stand putting it all on a plate for you. In that respect he was a poet as well as a director.I first saw this film after I first saw Star Wars, and although Star Wars blew me away as a child with it's rendition of space and it's visual effects - it paled in comparison to Kubrick's space-scapes. There's no speeding crafts and explosions with battle music, there's gentle pace and movement with Strauss' Blue Danube waltzing through your senses. These combinations of visual and aural stimulation sucked me in as a kid and still do when I watch it today. I know the visual effects are dated today, but I can still admire their beauty and craft.After watching this film, Kubrick became a genius to me, and I continue to wonder at his movies still.I'm not going into a dissection of 2001, but in summary it still raises questions (more so than answers, and that's the point!), and creates so much intrigue in our own humanity and evolution - more so than any other movie has or probably ever will.Whether you think you will hate this film, you still have to watch it in my opinion. It will give you something to take away whether you like it or not. I wish there were more mainstream movies like this. Hollywood is getting very dull...",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Too Clinical to be Engaging,"According to legend, during the premiere of 2001, Rock Hudson walked out of the screening yelling ""Will someone tell me what the hell this movie is about?"" Today I feel his frustration. Is the movie a marvel? Yes. Is this film ambitious? Yes. In the words of Bernardo Bertolucci a film ""made in poetry instead of prose?"" Yes. An entertaining film? Well...define entertaining. For while those on its wavelength would certainly benefit from having watched what is still regarded as not just a gold standard in science fiction but the ONLY standard in science fiction, others not inclined to watch ten minutes of flickering, tunneled lights shouldn't bother. My unbiased mind tells me I have just watched something near perfect, yet my biased, more affecting senses yen for something a little more emotionally rewarding.I honestly find 2001: A Space Odyseey to be prosaic. Stifled from the movie's top-heavy ambitions and need for perfection that it cannot register on an emotional level; at least not to me. It justifies itself by sending a message about technological society and how one day we will move beyond the tools we use to a higher form of consciousness.It's a message worth postulating and the midriff of the film properly highlights the movie's motif of said tools used for mutually assured destruction versus self-discovery but can't we encompass these themes into a tighter package? Then again I suppose if the film's point was introduced in familiar wrapping it would be easily digestible but also easily forgettable.Stanley Kubrick's work as a whole just doesn't hold much sway with me. His earlier work like The Killing (1956), Paths of Glory (1957) and Spartacus (1960) are to me, the perfect balance between intellectually stimulating and emotionally satisfying. Dr. Strangelove (1964), A Clockwork Orange (1971) Full Metal Jacket (1987) have their moments if only for their macabre sense of humor but 2001 along with Barry Lyndon (1975) and Eyes Wide Shut (1999) remain in my eyes, Kubrick at his most aloof.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Nobody gets it, don't worry","One reviewer wrote ""watching someone's life from beginning to end"" and that is part of how I would have to describe this film. We can edit that to also say; watching humanity's life from beginning to end. What does it mean?Don't let overly pretentious fools like Roger Ebert and the like fool you, it means almost nothing. Kubrick didn't know, Arthur C. Clarke didn't know. They made a technological marvel for us to ponder for the ages. It's not my place to judge art as ""good"" or ""bad"" and art such as this cannot be quantified. It has been rightfully criticized and rightfully hailed. There's enough good and bad said about the film.It gives me anxiety toward the end, and it makes me feel terrible inside. On top of it all, there's no pay-off at the end. Do not force yourself through it as I did. Only keep watching if it makes you feel something good. Don't fall too much for the HAL9000 subplot. Because it is just that, a subplot. It is window-dressing for the sake of fooling us into thinking the film has a plot. It doesn't. It is a clever way to show us space for two-and-a-half hours and somehow thinking there's a point to it all.In some way, you have to commend Kubrick for managing to create a masterpiece with no discernable criteria for a masterpiece being met. And that is where the film leaves you - in the darkness, surrounded by space, pondering the meaning of it all.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
2001: A Great Reason to Stay Home and Explore Space,"""2001"" is a pioneer of science fiction film-making, which inspired a new generation and gave audiences more than just cheap effects with little green men. Kubrick created a film that makes you think, not just about what is happening on the screen, but also what the future holds. In 1968, 2001 seemed like a million years away, and this is what Kubrick thought we would look like  now, in 2008, if he were alive  he could make a film called ""2012: A Space Odyssey"" and this critic would believe his view of the distant future.Kubrick opens our film with the power of sound. Like an opera beginning its set, we are left in the dark as our musicians begin their concertos that fill our ears with emotion and the unknown. Beginning in this way, it takes us (in a positive way) out of the feeling of the film, and that we are sitting in the best seats of the house for a performance of the theater of the absurd. With words reminiscent of Beckett, Kubrick brings both a voice and a sound to this film that is difficult to find in today's modern science fiction films. A modern similarity would be the independent film ""Primer"", but even that is a long shot. What makes ""2001"" more than just a film is the classical music Kubrick uses. As the film progresses, it feels as if the music was made with this film in mind. The ""dawn of man"" with the booming overture as our ape ancestors claw at the monolith will, and has, remained a staple in the cinematic world. With this sheet of black metal, Kubrick created a sound and an image that could never be duplicated  while some have tried  the emotion and feeling when the Sun and Earth crest the monolith on Mars can never be reproduced. With a minimal script, language used as a secondary way to complete the story, the sound needed to be perfect  and the full bodied orchestra did better than perfect. It created a sound for a place that is devoid of everything except darkness  space.With my ogling of sound complete, there were other elements of ""2001"" that were equally sharp and powerful. By dating a film there is always the risk of arriving to that date without finding any of the predictions true, the film becomes a cultural hick-up and forgotten in the canyons of cinema. What makes Kubrick's film impeccable is its ability to grow outside of the normality of average science fiction. While it holds a date of 2001, it does not mean that the Kubrick's themes become dated. This is difficult to explain, but watching ""2001"" in 2008 still was impressive. The technological advances, the exploration of the unknown, the questionable ethics of evolution still resonates in today's society and I feel that Kubrick knew this while making this film. Sure, this was his idea (or perhaps Clarke's idea) of the future, but it is still the future. By book marking it with the unspoken birth of humanity and with the rebirth of the ""Space Child""  it transcends the 2001-esquire moments. What makes this film go beyond the 2001 pitfall is that rarely is it mentioned the actual date. Outside of the title sequence and the brief moment with HAL, this film could be placed anywhere  and it does. Do not be fooled by the title, this is still a relevant film today as it was yesterday and through the years to come.One still cannot speak about this film without talking about HAL and that infamous line about the ""pod bay doors"". It has become more than just cultural chatter, but wine-chatter with film snobs. It is an important and provocative moment of the film, but the events surrounding it contain just as much recognition. In one fell swoop, HAL changes and the dawn of man becomes a page in the history books. The machines have become smarter than their creators, and a new dawn has arrived. Kubrick's scenes surrounding HAL were phenomenally spooky. That looming yellow eye stayed with me long after the film and can be still seen in current cinematic releases. With one fell swoop of the camera, Kubrick created man, developed the monolith, brought fear into technology, and then attempted to explain the meaning of life.Overall, this film has impressed me completely. The Homer-esquire journey that we, the viewer, take on this film is unparalleled in any other cinematic adventure. No other director could have helmed this project as well as given the darkness, the fear, the hope, and the overall sense of excitement to the screen. Kubrick was a film pioneer, his voice can continue to be heard today with any science fiction film that is released, and it is all due to this one singular film that chose to open with darkness and the score of an opera, and end with the eyes of a child. This is a science fiction film, but it is more than that. This is a history book. It is a page of our life that nobody wants to see. The monolith could represent anything, and there are film classes that spend years discussing it  and that is why this movie will remain firmly rooted in our catalog. I loved the sounds, I loved the technology, I loved the dark vacuum of space, but most importantly, I loved the unknown. This was not a linear story that one could watch and forget about  out of respect to Kubrick  watch this film, watch it again  point out the unknown and keep it fresh in your friend's mind. This is a glowing example of why films are made.Grade: ***** out of *****",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A meditative journey into the nature of our existence,"Hands down, and without a shadow of a doubt, 2001: A Space Odyssey is the greatest science-fiction picture ever made. Even if something similar is attempted today, it will inevitably still be streets behind Stanley Kubrick's influential masterpiece. After making a name for himself with classic films such as Paths of Glory (1957), Lolita (1962) and Dr. Strangelove (1964), Kubrick bolstered and cemented his reputation as one of the greatest filmmakers ever to grace our planet with the release of 2001, at a time when space exploration looked real and promising.2001 is a meditative journey into the nature of our existence. Kubrick explores many themes, most notably that of existentialism, man versus machine, and the cycle of life. At the beginning of the film, the director brings us back into the prehistoric age when humans looked like apes. The quest for survival slowly turns violent, from getting food and avoiding predators to forming ""clans"" to fight against each other for territorial rights.This is greatly juxtaposed with colonized space, which forms the bulk of 2001's remaining two hours. In one of the most stunning jump cuts ever, we see an ape-human throw a bone up into the bright sky and as gravity pulls it down in one swift motion, it suddenly becomes an image of a satellite (shaped like that bone) floating in dark, infinite (and gravity-less) space. In that mind-blowing split moment, Kubrick hurtles us thousands of years into the future.Colonizing space ironically leads to even deeper isolation. And this is felt by two crewmen onboard a manned flight to Jupiter. Actually, the phrase ""manned flight"" is misleading because the huge spacecraft they are in is completely controlled by a powerful and error-proof intelligent computer called HAL. Now, Kubrick plays on the man versus machine theme with devastating consequences for both sides. Reliance on technology could be a boon or a bane, and till this day, there isn't a film every year that does not ignite the hot debate over this.A final major theme of 2001 is the concept of the ever-continuing life cycle of human existence. The final sequence in which an astronaut finds himself inside a coldly detached room somewhere in space and sees the physical image of himself – a frail, old man having a meal, and then dying on a bed – not only provokes thought about the transient nature of life, but also asks of the question: Is there more to life after death?Kubrick seems to argue in the positive by presenting to us the blissful image of a star child overlooking the universe. Does it symbolize reincarnation, the continuation of the cycle of life? Or being one with the Creator? Or immortality? Up until then, and much so to his credit, Kubrick has not explicitly brought in ideas about religion, though one can argue that ""the monolith"", a rectangular grey block made of an unknown inert material that appears in four key moments in the film, is simultaneously a symbol of mystery, and the ultimate black box containing all the answers to our existence. In other words, ""the monolith"" could be God.2001 features Kubrick's unique melding of imagery and motion to the sound of classical music. Man-made space objects rotate and float across the length of the screen, as slow as the director would allow them to move so as to imitate the reality of motion in space. Working together with the famous Arthur C. Clarke (who co-wrote the screenplay), Kubrick brings astounding realism to his craftwork, building models of space objects to their finest details, and winning his only competitive Oscar in his career for Best Special Visual Effects.Kubrick's strong eye for visual symmetry (where props are placed and spaced equally) is also apparent and this would later go on to be a hallmark of his visual style in films like A Clockwork Orange (1971), and The Shining (1980), influencing a new generation of filmmakers including Paul Thomas Anderson (There Will Be Blood, 2007) and Duncan Jones (Moon, 2009).Perhaps the only drawback of 2001 is its very slow pace, which may frustrate on the first viewing (I felt the same way too). However, its snail-like pace will suit subsequent viewings better, especially when appreciation for Kubrick's craftsmanship, direction, and filmic vision mature with time. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a towering achievement, a science-fiction masterpiece that will never be equaled. It just might be Kubrick's greatest contribution to cinema.SCORE: 10/10 www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com All rights reserved!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
PhenomenHAL,"Last night I saw 2001: A Space Odyssey for the very first time. I don't know what has put me off seeking it out for all these years. Perhaps it's because I'm not a big sci-fi fan, however I am a Stanley Kubrick fan. I particularly adore The Shining and love the way Stanley Kubrick soaks up a hypnotic atmosphere so that the film becomes an experience. After seeing some clips on the strange documentary, Room 237, I thought that the film looked right up my alley! I've also heard nothing but hype for years with people calling it one of the greatest films ever made, so I was extremely excited when I sat down to watch it.Unfortunately watching it, for me, was a little bit like sex. You want the first time to be the best, but in honesty, the more you do it, the better it gets. I had a banging headache throughout the first half and so really could not appreciate the loud music and atonal sounds because it was just so painful! Halfway through, I had to leave and get myself a Tesco headache pill and towards the end of the film it did go away. I also left to go to the loo about three times, as I had a lot of coffee to drink so that I'd have the stamina to stay up and also to sober myself up.Why am I telling you this? Well, I don't know. I think to get the full 2001 effect, you need to completely immerse yourself in it, but I struggled to do this. However, that doesn't mean that I didn't appreciate what I saw. In fact, I'm pretty sure that what I saw was an absolute masterpiece. I was completely sucked in, right from the beginning where sinister music played for about five minutes over a blank screen. It's such an unusual way to open, hinting that the film you're about to see isn't your usual rip-roaring science fiction adventure. We then get that glorious famous music with a beautiful image of a sun rising over the Earth. It's an amazing title sequence which made the hairs on my neck stand on end.I think it's a stroke of genius having the first scene, in a film which is largely set in the future, be set at the beginning of time itself. It must have been so jarring for audiences in 1968, of course everyone knows that the film starts with the monkeys now because it's so widely talked about. Speaking of the year in which it came out, I cannot believe that this film was made in the 60's! I saw it in blu-ray and it looked like a film which had came out last week. It's easy to see why it so disliked when it first came out, because it's just so ahead of its time. Although, some of the monkey suits did look a bit naff!We're then thrown into the year 2001, where (apparently) space travel is an everyday thing and stewardesses wear bright pink clothes complete with a strange bubble hat. To be quite honest with you, the remainder of the film is very difficult to put into words. It's pure art in the form of film. It's a rarity these days, however people like David Lynch and Nicolas Winding Refn are striving to keep it alive. There are long sequences of spaceships flying overhead to classical music and people walking slowly upside down. It all creates a certain feeling and experience which you have to see for yourself.2001: A Space Odyssey doesn't really have much of a plot. Astronauts find a strange giant tablet on the moon, and then some more astronauts go on a mission which I don't entirely understand the purpose of, with a creepy robot called, HAL, which is of course now an iconic character. It's strange because a lot of the film is incredibly slow and, dare I say it, boring. But there's something about it which keeps you interested and locked to the screen. Scenes which would last five minutes in an ordinary Hollywood film, last up to half an hour here and it does create a unique and immersive experience which stays on your subconscious for a while.A lot of the film is very haunting. The choral chants whenever the strange black tablet appeared created a wonderful atmosphere of mystery and impending doom. I also found the scene where HAL sings, very creepy. Of course, the most talked about scene is the Lynchian finale where we're plunged into a psychedelic and hypnotic fantasy world. The final scene makes absolutely no sense, but it most definitely haunts you. I couldn't help but have chills all the way up my spine when the music plays and the baby looks right towards you. It's scary and very powerful.I think subsequent viewings are going to make 2001 a definite favourite of mine. It's unlike anything I've ever seen before. After seeing this now, I find it strange how people are comparing it to Interstellar. Interstellar is a somewhat conventional and fast-paced sci-fi adventure, albeit an absolutely astounding one! Whereas, 2001: A Space Odyssey is a slow art film. They're impossible to compare! Both of them are masterpieces in their own right though. It's a film which will definitely stay with me, and I look forward to plunging myself into its world again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A landmark film in science fiction.,"I vaguely remember seeing this film when it first came out in 1968. I was only 7 years old at the time, and it was at a drive-in theatre. When I asked my mother about it many years later, she said that as far as she could recall, it didn't seem to her I had been bored by the movie -- an amazing thing considering many adults find the movie boring.Even after having seen and been wowed by the special effects in Star Wars (I saw it 11 times in the theatre during its original run) and being amazed by the special effects in Jurrasic Park, I still say 2001 is the best science fiction movie ever made.As an adult I do not understand a lot of the philosophy of the movie but have been able to discern enough to figure out that it probably doesn't agree with my view of ""life, the universe and everything."" That still doesn't change my opinion about the movie. Considering it was made in 1968, the special effects are astounding and surpasses many of today's science fiction films. It's a great movie that set the standard for films to come.One last comment. I recommend 2001 fans to read Arthur C. Clarke's book ""The Lost Worlds of 2001."" It explains a lot of things about the movie and offers some interesting insights into how the movie and the book came into existence. It also includes Clarke's short story ""The Sentinal"" from which the idea for the movie, and again, the book, came.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Brilliant!,"I first saw this film alone one cold evening at the Astor theatre in Melbourne a couple of years ago, I was baffled at the ticket price- $25 but paid nonetheless. It was only afterwards I found out the lead actors Kier Dullea and Gary Lockwood where going to do a Q & A session- coming out from the US. Now, the Astor theatre is the only 'classic' style cinema left in Melbourne; it has just one screen (albeit quite large) and seating capacity for a large crowd.From the opening sequence- 3 minutes of blackness, accompanied by music to mirror the void, it was clear that '2001: A Space Odyssey was going' to be a large scale film. The thing I found remarkable about the film was how well the two most powerful elements of film, music and (of course) the visual picture, where crafted together. It is the synthesis of the two that makes this film great, and it is greatly aided by the powerful and memorable score. Indeed, the film won the 1969 Oscar for visual effects, while the masterful direction of Stanley Kubrick earned him a nomination.It is difficult to describe the plot of '2001' without boring you, my good reader, to death. I'll therefore leave it at this; monolith (cubical wall?), Monkey, HAL-9000, mission to Jupiter. This movie has borne many famous and spoofed scenes and to any who know nothing about the film, he/she/it/walrus will find the watching of this quite informative.If you like direct action, look somewhere else, to keep it simple- no guns are fired. It must be said though, that because one can only watch this in a rare, insightful mood, it is not suitable for everyday viewing. Any way bugger off now",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Disappoints in the end,"This film promises a lot in the beginning, but in the end one almost feels cheated. It is stylistically a very interesting film, with great visuals and a great sense of mood that it creates. But in the end it delivers a message that 'god' is so alien and seemingly disinterested in us, that we might as well be alone in the universe. There is no way to communicate with that thing, even when we follow its own invitation. I don't like that kind of message, and what I like even less is the gratuitous ending that spent an eternity making that point. It felt more like abuse. It was also self-indulgent, and that's something I find alienating. The film also suffers from a lack of narration. For the most part, the film is an experience, not a story being told. In the second of four acts, we follow a scientist on his journey from Earth to an orbital station, then to the Moon, then to an excavation site on the Moon. Yet nothing happens. He has a few utterly meaningless conversations and holds the least informative speech in history. Why this was done is beyond me. If the goal was to underpin the general feeling of alienation in the endless and utterly incomprehensible universe, then it may have worked to some degree, but it still came across as poor screenwriting. In the end, the film both impresses and disappoints.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Complete and utter trash.,"Yes, the arty-farty brigade would have you believe this is one of the greatest films ever. Don't believe them!! The film is slow, dull, with almost no storyline. It is a collection of connected short stories that have been put to music. Long slow panning camera shots and lengthy black screen sections. Dialogue is minimal, acting is poor at best. As for the final sequence in the stories, I can only assume it was produced during a very bad acid trip while watching a lava lamp.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
2001: A Space Odyssey,"Well, my mind was officially blown by my second undertaking of a Stanley Kubrick feature. Being a huge fan of auteur David Lynch, I was greatly looking forward to watching another film of Kubrick's. Before this viewing, I had only seen The Shining (and who hasn't) so I was ready for more Kubrick. This 1968 Sci-fi epic starring Keir Dullea, Gary Lockwood, and William Sylvester tells the cautionary tale of modernization and the advancement of technology, and what that advancement means for the human race. When a group of astronauts is sent into deep space, they realize the horrors of the possibility of technology taking over humanity.Dr. Heyward Floyd (William Sylvester) eagerly and hastily sets up another deep space mission which he provides little public details of to those around him. Dr. Floyd hurried to the Florida launch station with his guarded secret to attend a meeting with a top official that would get his project off the ground. He then learns that a discovery has been made below the moon's crest that predates human existence. Energized by this undebatable proof of extraterrestrial life, Heyward assembles a group of scientists to investigate the phenomenon, only to be turned away by the piercing scream of a magnetic disturbance once they arrive at the scene. The conscious members on board the mission are Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood), they are on the trip with other members ""hibernating"" until they reach Jupiter. Hal 9000, an artificially intelligent supercomputer maintained many ship functions and interacted with the crew daily. After a series of events in which Hal attempts to cease communication with Earth, the crew decides to disconnect Hal fearing their isolation from Earth. Sensing the emerging disdain of the crew, Hal attempts to cause the death of the crew to protect its own operating system. A fight between man and machine ensues and the battle can only be won by willpower, and endurance, and which party can overcome the crippling fear of isolation.I was glad I was forewarned about the need to ""stick with"" this film. It opens with a 20 minute plus sequence that felt like I had strapped in for a Nat. Geo. documentary. The audience is 25 minutes into the film before there is any dialogue, which was an incredible feat for a modern film. The sound completely takes over the film overwhelming the audience with its ever presence. The sound acts as an independent character revealing the slow deterioration of the crew involved in the mission. So incredible was the sound that it is almost enough to drive the audience crazy, akin to the characters who are mentally declining as the film progresses. When there was more than hollow noise and high, shrill moans, there was an overabundance of Strauss music, adding to the out of this world experience of the mission. The acting in this film was wonderful, with the strongest performance being the unseen Hal 9000 who commands the picture. The cinematography is nothing short of masterful, and I realized quickly why Stanley Kubrick's direction is so oft cited as brilliance. The sets were so intricate and grandiose that they added to the mysticism and realism of a space ship flying through the galaxy. The colors are also spectacular adding to the brilliance of the plot. Kubrick, in a display of his directorial prowess, utilizes the most inventive camera angles I have ever seen, creating an unimaginative level of depth to his film. Kubrick is certainly an auteur and one that I can't wait to explore more of.Isolation is a force in which can bring the most intense human behavior. Silence and being alone can lead to the mental decomposition in even the strongest of individuals. The intensity of isolation was fully explored in 2001: A Space Odyssey. Hal 900 seeks dominance, and the overtaking of humans by artificial intelligence has been a fear of humanity since the Industrial Revolution. The battle between Hal and the human members of the crew was waged over the overwhelming isolation and fear of being replaced by the other. The evolution of humanity has injected new fears into our psyche, and few directors could have brought that war and vision to life; thankfully, Stanley Kubrick took the task, and left audiences with nothing less than film mastery.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
the cinema achieves its final goal,"Hegel once said, of course I'm simplifying, that the final goal of art was to be able to express itself using only the means that define it. Therefore, painting had to express itself with colors and shapes, dancing with the movement of the body, music with sounds, etc. Nevertheless, painting was in Hegel's time far away from its final goal because what it did was just to tell a story in a paintings, it was just a variation of literature. Nowadays, it is the same thing with cinema which in Hegel's point of view, has to express itself with movement (because cinema is the art of the moving image, of course), and it is far, far, far away. But from time to time, it comes close from this final pourpose, and it is what happens in this superbe movie in the moments where the story stops and we just see images of a stunning beauty and poetry, particularly when we see the lunar base from the outside or when the astronaut is travelling through time and space and the images become really a symphony of movement and colours that speak for itself without coming near to telling you a story. What I am trying to say in my lousy English is that 2001 reaches a point never achieved before nor afterwards, to my knowledge. It becomes cinema in his more complete, pure and absolute way. Not a variation of literature, but the art of the moving image. Kubrick makes cinema come near to what it is supposed to be in its more evolved way, he becomes a sort of Kandinsky or Mondrian of the filmaking.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Dazzling Masterpiece.,"Stanley Kubrick's visually dazzling, intellectually stimulating and ambitious film makes one of the best uses of the medium known as cinema ever made. Film begins when humans were still apes, and how, when one of them touches a huge, mysterious monolith, he is pushed forward in evolution, and uses an old bone as a tool(to smash and kill of course...) Thousands of years later, man is now on the moon, and another monolith is uncovered, inspiring a spaceship crew to investigate, causing the on board ship computer HAL9000 to malfunction(sensing the oncoming next evolution it cannot experience?) One astronaut enters the monolith, and he(and the viewer) see an astonishing, even overwhelming assault on the senses that leads to...Well, for those who haven't seen it, no spoilers, but just consider how a ""star child"" fits in at the end...

Kubrick's groundbreaking sci-fi film remains a classic milestone for the future.,"Let us remember Stanley Kubrick as a genius of provocative filmmaking, and also a prophet of events that came and went. 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY has survived the test of advanced time. Not just in eye candy, but the imagination of living in an artificial world where new forms of communication are evitable. This is science fiction a step forward in fantasy that becomes reality. In this case, things already have...Don't thrash the movie's opening sequence. Try to picture your mind the living standards man would use later. With a few primates hanging around the barren land of Earth, there is a point of significance about the future of civilization. ""The Dawn Of Man"" instantly becomes ""The Dawn Of Computer"". The primates' ways of intelligence is applied for the next challenge in an artificially run setting like the year 2001. Smart thinking from Kubrick!As I've said numerous times before, visuals do not always make the movies, but this is an exception when you had a movie that revolutionized special effects. For 1968, expect the impossible. If you have remembered seeing this in the theater, it's because you had terrible seizures from looking at the most vibrant graphics and pyrotechnics ever mastered on film. No object is ever tacked onto the print (like the Starship Enterprise), and they look like glimpses of future sci-fi hits including STAR WARS. But if you have developed severe hemorrhoids after the film was over, it was because of the knockout ""hyperwarp"" scene. Its amazing display of dazzling colors and quick speed still rivals against the eye-heavy, eye-demanding visuals of today's movies. Give this one another thirty years to prove itself worthy as time and technology progresses. Truly incredible!Like I mentioned, Stanley Kubrick acts as a prophet by using ideas that soon become reality or has already happened. The supercomputer HAL-9000 is a perfect example, which lead to modern operative machines and devices running on simple chips and bits of hardware. And did this movie predict a form of network communication like the Internet? Computer malfunctions? Artificial intelligence? If time had only told us, the answer is strictly ""yes"". But let's continue to believe that this is a science fiction movie without inducing panic.There may be thousands of other possibilities to discover from this masterpiece. We've learned an awful lot out of this one, though. I don't mean to say it ""is"" the greatest thing ever created (and no, TITANIC ""is"" not the greatest, either), but if we can dig deep into Kubrick's finest talents of a genuine Hollywood classic, we'll know that 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY can easily withstand all of the mediocrity that will continue to play in the high-tech multiplexes.A perfect ""9"" winner from you know who!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spectacle over substance.,"They showed this back in the late 70's one night in my high school gym. Most of us were stoned or drunk.

The Ultimate Trip of the Imagination,"After 30 plus year, 2001: A Space Odyssey still continues to amaze and astound.  The art of film making has made long strides since Kubrick's masterpiece, but it still stands the test of time.  Influencing countless directors from George Lucas to Steven Spielberg, 2001 is definitely the jewel of Stanley Kubrick's career.In 2 ½ hours, the film is able to span from the dawn of man to the space age.  Watched and influence by the mysterious monolith, man is able to used tools to manipulate his environment and also kill.  There is possibly no greater juxtaposition of images than from the thrown bone to the orbiting satellite.  In a few brief seconds, we are able to see how man has gone from cave-dweller to space-dweller. It is also hard to forget the masterful scene of the space ship floating to the ""Blue Danube Waltz.""  This is perhaps no greater use of images and score in the history of film.  The sequence is just a marvel to look and stirs up emotions of wonder, marvel, and pure excitement.  The film then jumps 18 months to the future where a larger than life ship is on an interception course for Jupiter.  The ""Discovery"" is perhaps Kubrick's greatest accomplishment. The meticulous detail is scene on the ship and the attention to its detail allows it to be as grand as anything that is in film today.  There are also great scenes in this ship including the rotating living quarters and the classic death scene of HAL in the red brain room of the computer.  The last 20 or so minutes of this film are one of its mysteries.  The star show followed by the eerie hotel scene followed by the ""space baby"" turn off a lot of viewers, because they are seemingly incomprehensible.  Whatever the explanations are, one has to admire the imagination it required to create that endingThere are a lot of detractors to this film saying it is to slow, there is not enough dialogue, and the ending is confusing.  It is true that this film is different from other movies, but that is one of its strong points. Kubrick took risks with this movie at that is why is often considered one of the best movies of all time.  People should not worry about the plot to much, because this movie is all about visuals and the sheer wonder of the unknown.  All you have to do is sit back and enjoy the ride.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Magnificent self indulgence,"Stanley Kubrick's slow go science fiction piece demands patience from its audience as he bombards it with endless visual and audio extravagance at a sometimes snail pace that challenges one's concentration and endurance. It is a film experience to be survived with an outcome that will either dazzle you or bore you to tears.Something or someone is dropping large domino shaped monoliths about the galaxy. They seem to exude a superior intelligence bent on spreading the wealth where it takes on Earth enabling evolving mankind to kill and conquer through weaponry. When another monolith is discovered far into the future on the moon, Earth sends an expeditionary team comprised of five humans and one sharp self confident computer, Hal 9000 to inspect and follow the trail to Jupiter to get the lowdown. Dissension breaks out on the ship however and the mission is jeopardized.2001 is a visually stunning experience to behold on the big screen. It asks a lot of its audience and caught in the right frame of mind a cinematic experience of the first order. Ultimately it comes down to whether your mood is in alignment with Kubrick's tedious at times self indulgent floating rhythm. For nearly the first half hour there is no dialog for the remarkable opening transition from the dawn of man to present day space travel. Accompanied by a spot on music score (Strauss, Khachakurian) you are carried through space in a graceful and awe inspiring fashion both inside and outside the ship. The suspense ramps up when Hal goes rogue but even at this juncture Kubrick maintains his deliberate turgid pace that for some may ask too much. The visual fireworks really explode in the final segment partnered with an auditory assault that is to be endured rather than passively enjoyed as the last surviving astronaut roars toward Jupiter.2001 is a milestone in sci fi cinema; the halfway point between Melies Trip to the Moon from the 19th century and the ease at which advanced technology in this day and age can achieve creating similar terrain. Kubrick's use of sound and score to accompany his odd angled flowing visuals is indeed as mind blowing an experience one might have in 20th century film but his pace is painstakingly slow at times and you may find yourself wanting to abandon ship. Since it's opening decades back I have made half a dozen attempts to stay the course with this beast of a movie and finished it three times, twice with disappointment results. The one other time I completed it I walked out truly blown away. It is the one that remains with me and it is a very rewarding experience informing perhaps that the fault is in ourselves not the star, Stanley Kubrick.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
2001 in 2007,"Back when I first saw 2001 on the big screen  more years ago than I'd care to think -- I thought it was the greatest movie ever made. It had it all, mystical theme, dazzling (for its day) special effects, cool technology, and Kubrick's trademark meticulous direction. I've probably seen it more times than any other film, and I usually managed to suck back a few tokes in time for the stargate sequence at the end. I've seen the sequel 2010, read Clarke's novel (and all of his sequels) as well as other books and essays that attempted to explain and/or expand on the movie's rather abstruse plot. But, it has been several years since I last saw it, so when I saw the re-release DVD on sale I picked it up and re-watched it again for the first time since the actual year 2001.Although after my numerous viewings the film couldn't contain any surprises it was still cool to watch it with fresh eyes. A few things struck me. For starters, I think the film has aged rather well. The special effects, stunning in their day, are rather commonplace now, but that's largely due to the influence of 2001 itself. Still, with one or two exceptions, they're still as good as many of the computer-generated effects of today, and in some cases, better.Second, I noticed for the first time that, perhaps because of the front-projection backdrops and rather stagy lighting in the ""dawn of man"" chapter, it had an eerie, almost CGI-like ambiance. It was almost as if the whole sequence was computer-generated, à la Final Fantasy. Interesting. And still, after all these years, the ape makeup is still pretty incredible, way better than Planet of the Apes, which snagged the Oscar for best makeup that year (some folks say it's because the Academy didn't realize the apes in 2001 were actually actors).Third, horribly stilted dialog. I'm surprised I never really noticed this before, but then, I probably wasn't watching it for the character development (see the toke comment above). Seen with 2007 eyes, the dialog had a distinctly ""60's"" feel to it, rather like the 50's dialog that was so well recreated in Good Night and Good Luck. People just talked differently then, although it's a difficult distinction to quantify. Still, given the fact that there's hardly any of it (the first actual words come some 20 minutes in), this didn't really detract from my enjoyment per se.Fourth, a few anachronisms. For example, Pan Am no longer exists; therefore the shuttle looks rather dated. Also, I'm willing to bet that, should Kubrick still be alive and working on 2001 today, he would likely be a lot more creative in depicting zero-gee. 2001 was the first sci-fi film to actually address the fact of weightlessness in space rather than simply ignoring it, but by the same token Kubrick in many scenes took the easy way out (vis, the ""grip shoes"" worn by the shuttle flight attendant), which, seen through 2007 eyes, looks a little cheesy. For example, why bother to climb or descend a ladder in zero-gee, when a little hop will get you there with a fraction of the effort? It was pretty obvious in some scenes (on the bridge and the pod deck, both of which were supposedly weightless areas of the ship) that Bowman and Poole were actually carrying weight. I also noticed, in most cases for the first time, many of the ""goofs"" listed here on IMDb. Perhaps with an additional 30 years of movie appreciation behind me, I am a little more observant.The stargate sequence: still not bad, although it probably could be dashed off today in a few hours using CGI, instead of the months it took Doug Trumbull to do it at the time using slit scan. I still really like the ""Jupiter space"" sequences. It has a wonderfully remote, alien vibe to it, especially the shots of this teeny-tiny spacecraft hovering in a void, dwarfed by the moons of Jupiter looming over it.And as for the ending, well, what can I say? Cool, but still completely incomprehensible (despite having read the book). All in all, although I would no longer call it my favorite film (I don't think I have a favorite any more, really) it still ranks up there with some of the greats, and it deserves a place in the IMDb top 250 if for no other reason than that it set the bar for all of the space movies that followed it, the Star Wars franchise, Close Encounters, the Alien trilogy, Star Trek, etc. etc. etc. It still, even after all these years, has one of the most ""technically accurate"" depictions of space travel of any of them. ...And it's kind of sad that even today, 6 years after the year 2001, we still don't really have bases on the moon, commercial space stations in orbit, or artificial intelligence.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Meditative Movie With Complex Contemplation,"There have been Books Written about this Film. A Distinction reserved for very few. The Wizard of Oz (1939)...Citizen Kane (1940)...King Kong (1933) are among the Elite.

To say that the Pacing is Slow would be an Understatement. But to say that it is a Failure as Art or Entertainment would be a Conceit that is Without Foundation.It is Ultra-Art. It is a Pristine Picture with an Ambiance befitting its Philosophical and Cosmological Story. One cannot come away from this Film without an Opinion.Even if that Personal Reflection is one of Disdain, it has achieved its Purpose to Enlist a Reaction.

A hopeful vision for the future of Humanity,"This film more than any other I have ever watched, has left an indelible impression upon my soul. Everything about '2001:A Space Odyssey', from every tiny nuance of realistic detail, to the overall sweepingly majestic epic wonder of the whole, holds endless fascination and emotion for me.  A true masterpiece of pacing and plot development (yes there is one!), perhaps only a visionary of cinema, that Stanley Kubrick undoubtedly was (R.I.P. much missed Droogie), could have done justice to the grandeur of Arthur C. Clarke's novel. The entire film unfolds slowly like an archetypal dream; lucid, intensely emotional, at times overwhelmingly so (this film has brought tears of wonderment to my eyes many times), and of course utterly perplexing. Although the character development is left to a minimum, I think this is what makes the story so compelling.  The human drama, as real as it is from the point of view of the various protagonists, is merely a backdrop against which is set the slow contemplation of Humanity's place in the Cosmic Scheme. Personally I see in the character of HAL the embodiment of human reason and its ultimately fallable attempts to fathom the unknown depths of reality. We make the assumption that the world is ultimately rational, but perhaps this is not so, and our little islands of certainty are merely transient truths, that are but insignificant dim reflections of a greater Reality. The rebirth as a StarChild to my mind represents the next stage of human evolution, necessary for us to fully comprehend both ourselves and the Universe.  The use of 'Also Sprach Zarathustra' as the main theme music, complements perfectly the Nietzchian idea that humanity is but a bridge between animal and beyond human.Highly recommended for anyone, whether you like science-fiction movies or not.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A wondrous journey from the dawn of man to beyond the infinite,"Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is rightly recognized as a cinema classic. It is a film that everyone should see at least once though those who appreciate it will certainly not restrict themselves to a single viewing.In fact, given the complexity of the story, multiple viewings are recommended. The plot is relatively simple (at least until the later stages) but it is the underlying themes that will occupy your thoughts. The film leaves much up to the interpretation of the viewer, so there is plenty of material to ruminate upon.This is a film that says a lot by saying very little. There isn't much dialogue and sound of any kind is typically kept to a minimum. The story is mostly told in a visual manner, at times augmented by deftly chosen music. In particular, the segments supported by Strauss's 'Blue Danube' waltz are among the most beautiful ever committed to celluloid.Overall, Kubrick's direction is impeccable, as is the cinematography. Amazingly, the special effects (which earned the film it's sole Oscar) are strikingly realistic, even by today's standards. The music is also top-notch, not to mention genuinely iconic.The actors don't have a lot to do but they perform their roles admirably. Ironically, the most memorable role is the super-computer HAL, which conveys more with a voice than many actors do with their full range of body language.I've written this after seeing the film for the third or fourth time but only the first on the big screen.

A film that will grow with you,"2001: A Space Odyssey is a rare movie experience, one of mesmerizing visuals, meticulous craft, full of valuable interpretations, and a work to stand the test of time. Even as computer-generated imagery (CGI) has given animation, action films, and fantasy pictures an antiseptic sleekness and a practical way to showcase certain unforeseen sequences as if they could really happen, films like Star Trek: A Motion Picture, its corresponding TV series, and 2001: A Space Odyssey existed in a time where amateurish special effects where what was predominately available. Director Stanley Kubrick and the studio of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), however, found sources to provide beautiful and limitless cinematography and special effects work in order to bring space into theaters all over the world. This achievement alone is enough to warrant 2001's placement amongst some of the most important films of all time.That's just what 2001 is - one of the most significant films ever made. Its use of special effects is incredible, its themes ranging from existentialism to human and mankind's value in the face of excelling technology, its developed and authentic style showcasing space exploration, and its use of detailed visuals all make its placement on such a list a worthy one. Too many people get caught up in trying to find ""the best"" films that they forget about the ones that made splashes, which circumvented into impacts, game-changers, and iconic works. 2001 is an iconic work from a director who, had he never touched cinema, may've set cinema back several years.The film is divided into four vignettes that detail man's interactions with advanced and incalculably valuable Monoliths, otherwise known as high-powered machines that do much of the thinking for humans when it comes to space travel and exploration. The first vignette concerns ""the dawn of man,"" following ape-like beings trying to find food in a vast desert, the second concerns passengers aboard a Pan-AM space plane that learn of an epidemic occurring at one of the Lunar bases they're destined to come in contact with, the third and longest shows a group of scientists traveling aboard the spacecraft ""Discovery One,"" joined by the advanced, supercomputer HAL 9000, a machine that should be helping them on their journey to Jupiter but instead seems to be hindering them, and the fourth concerns Jupiter and beyond.Each of these vignettes could easily spawn individual reviews, and because of that, it's difficult to look at 2001: A Space Odyssey as an entire project. In one-hundred and forty-eight minutes, the film manages to be often enthralling, wondrous, and on occasions, maddening, as some scenes shine and other scenes seem to drag. But all is well, as there is always something occurring in Kubrick's realm of directorial flair and Geoffrey Unsworth's unmatchable cinematography.With all the praise 2001's visuals have earned, it seems like nothing more than a waste of time to address them once again, but they must be. Unsworth's detail is simply exquisite, whether he is showing the vast openness and emptiness of space or he is showing the calculated quarters of these large and sometimes quite ominous spacecrafts. Pay attention to Kubrick and Unsworth's use of the color red, as it often is used to denote fear, vulnerability, and uncertainty. In addition, consider some of the unique and trickier visual sequences, such as the famous Star-Gate scene, where thousands and thousands of colors hit the screen at once, causing a mass amount of pressure and unbelievable visual annihilation on ones retinas. The scene was accomplished thanks to slit-scan photography, which is where a slide that has been slit is inserted between the camera and the camera's subject, resulting in a disorienting but indescribably beautiful and unique work of art.Because of 2001's plethora of visual techniques, along with its lengthy runtime, there's a lot to see but also a lot of detail to miss in terms of sights and themes. With this being my first viewing, I was astounded by how useless and void of significance the human characters are in this film. They essentially have no value outside of being devices for which the Monoliths and the technology work off of. This is quite the bleak future Kubrick and co-writer Arthur C. Clarke.2001: A Space Odyssey works the best when there is no dialog or character interaction and we're left to focus on a spacecraft drifting in the cold loneliness of space or we're watching the stars sit amongst the darkness. This is cinema at its most meditative and beautiful, especially with the wonderful score that chimes in at just the right times. The film goes down in my book for one of the best uses of a particular piece of music, in this case, the film's frequent use of ""The Blue Danube."" There's so much in 2001: A Space Odyssey, between its visuals, its score, its themes, and its commentary, that it easily warrants more viewings, which I plan to get on in the future. This is the kind of film I can see doing different things for me at different points in my life. Perhaps a second viewing will assure its themes, which I'm still trying to grasp and understand, become more vivid and clearer, where maybe a viewing when I'm an adult affirms realities about the world around us. I'm optimistic for the film to progressively get more insightful and more enriching as time goes on; that's one thing many modern, big-budget films boasting grandiose visuals and effects have a difficult time with.Starring: Keir Dullea, Gary Lockwood, William Sylvester, and Douglas Rain.

"2001: A Space Odyssey is cinema at its best, a spectacular experience and a sci-fi masterpiece - My Ultimate Review","Being a big fan of the sci-fi genre, I'm quite surprised it took me this long to watch 2001: A Space Odyssey which is supposed to be one of the best science fiction films of all time. I agree, it was epic and stunning, brilliantly produced and directed by Stanley Kubrick who co-wrote the film with author Arthur C. Clarke. The previous film I watched of Kubrick was A Clockwork Orange, a film that came out three years after ""2001"". It had a phenomenal cast, and so does this movie. Keir Dullea, Gary Lockwood, William Sylvester and Douglas Rain playing the leading roles. They're all great, but I didn't find the acting to be the best of this movie, like I did A Clockwork Orange. It's the ambition and vision Kubrick had, the whole production was superb.After uncovering a mysterious artifact buried beneath the Lunar surface, a spacecraft is sent to Jupiter to find its origins - a spacecraft manned by two men and the supercomputer H. A. L. 9000.The film is noted for its scientifically accurate depiction of space flight, pioneering special effects, and ambiguous imagery. Kubrick avoided conventional cinematic and narrative techniques; dialogue is used sparingly, and there are long sequences accompanied only by music. Making this film epic in every sense, but the slow pacing might not be for everyone, but the imagery and attention of detail and accuracy is something I think most will appreciate. Critics noted its exploration of themes such as human evolution, technology, artificial intelligence, and the possibility of extraterrestrial life. The themes are executed perfectly, Stanley Kubrick truly knew what he wanted, and his vision is something mesmerizing. It was nominated for four Academy Awards, winning Kubrick the award for his direction of the visual effects. The film is now widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made. In 1991, it was deemed ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.2001: A Space Odyssey is and will forever be cinema, I can only imagine how the experience was to see this in the cinema, how it was intended to be seen. Cinematically, it reached a new limit and its a huge thanks to Stanley Kubrick. He went to the length to involve himself in every aspect of production, even the smallest thing of choosing the fabric for his actors' costumes to the furniture. But the studio didn't give him full rein regarding the post-production, after an early screening for MGM executives it was edited and scenes were cut. But let's get back to how groundbreaking the film truly is, for example the special effects, not one single thing was computer generated thus making everything practical. It's remarkable really, how they pioneered many of the things we have come so used in seeing. Simply, phenomenal work done by Kubrick and everyone else in the departments. They influenced many people around the world and that's a fact.You could ask yourself, what was the purpose of this movie? Well that is just the thing, its themes and symbolism. It's often your interpretation that matters. But honestly, I loved the film and the story it told. 2001: A Space Odyssey reminded me of two another realistic sci-fi films called Interstellar and Ad Astra, it was also extremely slow paced but so spectacular and epic. These three are among the best sci-fis out there. Stanley Kubrick created a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The only film that gives a meaning to everything.,"If somebody ask me ""which is the best movie of all time?"" I probably say 2001:A.S.O.Colors and film are perfect, music is mixed in one thing with the slow ritmo of the movie... what about sounds... No films better still in 2007. You can think in every single frame, you can be very touched just by Keir Dullea's breath, his desolation, an endless way to find ourself. I must admit that whoever writes a negative thing about this movie is only without any possible sense of exploring or spiritual soul.-1968- !!! crazy to do such a thing....Kubrick was (or better ""is"") the elegant open-minded good genius that only few people could understand...Fotography is unbelievable... fantastic techniques, instruments. All the emotions are the man's emotion,(a little under-rated masterpiece)The best director of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Theory of Evolution,"A lot of mixed opinions on this classic Sci-Fi. There's no denial in the innovation that took place in this film. Some of the style is just too out there and didn't gain as much traction, but there's a ton where it's simply the forerunner on many things to come for the genre. The idea that we are helped along in our evolution by mysterious alien monoliths is indeed an interesting story.I feel as I'm in the in between of opinions, I see and can agree with those who call it a masterpiece with certain aspects. But, I'm equally in agreeance with those who say overrated, boring, and what the bleep. I'd most certainly have to agree with the last 20 minutes or so for the very open to interpretation ending. I have to believe acid was a factor.I commend the science of the film, and the effects for a film from 1968. The colour is also great. The acting, is not bad, but there's also not much there for personality, and I suppose it may be designed that way. Monotone Hal ends up being the most interesting character. He or it definitely inspired many rogue AI storytelling in the years to come.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Pure Art,"So 2001: A Space Odyssey is 2 and a half hours long. I really don't know where to begin... I guess general thoughts. I won't spoil anything, but the truth is I could try to spoil this movie and I still wouldn't spoil anything. It's not that type of movie. It's not really a movie. There are very, very small pieces of plot sprinkled throughout the movie, and that might sound bad, but it's not. This movie just does things for the sake of beauty, something that rarely any other movie does. Every single shot is perfect. The cinematography is perfect. The colors are perfect. The atmosphere are perfect. The sets are perfect. The costumes are perfect. Like I said, this is really more of a dream-like experience. It's super long, and unlike a movie like Inception (where time flies by when watching), I'd say time is almost going at half speed while watching this. And that isn't a bad thing. There are parts where you may be bored or apprehensive, but at the same time your subconsience is appreciating the art. I think the reason it is dream-like is the lack of emphasis on plot, but emphasis on images. Emotion. Feeling. Don't go into this expecting the best plot over, there barely is any, go into this being prepared to absorb art. Time goes slow, but you still love it. The pieces of plot that are in here are very well done, and my interpretation of the thing was this kind of giant saga. You might interpret it different. The logical interpretation isn't the point though, it's what the movie makes you feel. And it made me feel things that very few movies can do. I'm having a really hard time trying to express my thoughts, so I'll just end it there. It was a masterpiece, and I think assigning a number rating wouldn't do any good, so I'll just leave it at that.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Impressive for its time.,"This being my first time watching the movie, I didn't find it as enjoyable as someone likely did if they watched it several decades ago. The mysterious monolith kept me intrigued for the better part of the movie, and I quite enjoyed how the movie had minimal dialogue and was mainly about observation. The movie was definitely ahead of its time - especially with video effects; and the film really had an impact on how movies were made today. On top of that, it had absolutely chilling music that still managed to give goosebumps.The major thing that made me not enraptured by the film was the prolonged scenes that made the length of the movie unnecessarily long. I felt like several portions of the movie were drawn-out to make the viewer watch in awe of how amazing and advanced life is in the future and in space, which really diminishes the movies test of time. Upon the movies release it was likely enjoyable to watch those long and slow scenes, but today it feels otherwise.Aside from the movie not being as enjoyable to those who may have watched a plethora of more modern science fiction movies - it still is worth a watch, just to see how impressive it is for a movie made in the 60's.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An epic of proportions,"Kubrick's masterpiece known as 2001: A Space Odyssey gets better with each viewing.  The music is excellent, and the cinematography is even better. The story is profound, somewhat confusing at times.  The reason many people, whom I know, that dislike 2001 is they didn't understand it.  Read the book, by Arthur C. Clarke, which is an amazing piece of literature.  The book cleared up many questions I had, even though the movie is fairly straightforward if you pay attention.  The dialogue, though scarce, is executed well.  HAL 9000's voice is emotionless, maybe even ""chilling,"" thus heightening tension.  All in all, 2001 is an experience not to be missed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
My #1 film,"As you can probably tell from my identity (2001ASOfan) ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is my number 1 film on my personal Top 10 list.  I saw it at the age of 14, and it was the first film that fully engaged my imagination and tapped into thoughts I had previously had about life after death, the universe, eternity, and, on a slightly more mundane level, space travel. ;-) My knees were literally shaking when I got up to leave the movie theatre after viewing it, and I wasn't even on any of the recreational drugs so many of my fellow theatregoers were on!  I didn't need them--it gave me a natural ""high"" that touched me at the deepest of emotional and intellectual levels. I have seen ""2001"" many times since that first riveting, obviously unforgettable, experience, and I marvel at how the film holds up, even in terms of its special effects, especially considering its 1968 birth.  I have to admit the initial ""ape"" scenes have paled a bit, but they are thankfully a brief intro to the film, and the film still soars for me from the moment the final ""ape"" throws the bone into the air and it turns into a space ship, floating in the heavens.  For new viewers, though, keep in mind that director Stanley Kubrick intended ""2001"" to be a VERY visual experience, and it is a much lesser experience on a small TV screen (or even a big-screen TV, for that matter).  Try to make your first experience one in a movie theatre--keep in mind that it is being re-released this fall of 2001 in theatres around the world.  I encourage you to make the effort to see it on a big theatre screen--you won't be disappointed.  ""2001"" turned me on to film as an art form, and film as a potentially life-changing experience, and I've been hooked ever since.  Kubrick continued to fascinate me with his films through the years right up to his death, mesmerizing me with ""Eyes Wide Shut"" just before his passing.  I am wary that the project he was working on at his death, ""AI,"" is being made by Steven Spielberg, as I would've loved to have seen Kubrick's interpretation of it.  I will undoubtedly see the Spielberg version, but will be thinking of Kubrick while watching.  I have always thought of Kubrick's films as an acquired taste, and was careful who I recommended them to, so it always amazed me when any of them were commercially successful.  It's especially heartening to see ""2001"" embraced now continuously through the years as one of the best films of all time--since many of us felt pretty lonely back then defending it. It was a love/hate reaction for many back then.  In closing:  Thanks, Mr. Kubrick, wherever you are!  In the spirit of ""2001,"" I hope you're a peaceful and all-knowing ""Star Child"" now that you've passed on to whatever's next.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Sweeping Science Fiction Epic Stands on its Own,"A film I experienced many times on the small screen but first time at the cinema as part of a 50th Anniversary showing.It is an epic science fiction story with long, sweeping scenes and grandiose concepts that slowly builds tension. The score is powerful and often unworldly and where the cold, harsh environment of space or large landscapes were present, the music gives way to long silences, equally as moving.The abstract elements felt like lucid dreams and the whole film leaves so much work for the audience, it is a departure from the more generally visceral, fast paced and clear narrative of modern films. To place the film in context, which it deserves, this was released one year before man landed on the moon.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Stanley Kubrick's ambiguous science fiction epic continues to baffle audiences around the world, even more than three decades after it was filmed.","The obvious question that someone is going to ask after watching 2001: A Space Odyssey is, `What was the meaning of that damn monolith?' Well, as is the case with the majority of great movies, 2001 spawns thinking and discussion. A movie that answers all of its questions neatly and in a timely manner can rarely be anything more than something to watch to kill a couple of hours. But 2001 is so creative and so mysterious that you really have to think about it and even watch it a few times over before you can begin to come up with a coherent meaning from it. This is a science fiction film for the thinking audience, as opposed to the fast food schlock that is cranked out by Hollywood (Mission To Mars, Pitch Black, Supernova, Armageddon, and other such nonsense), but with the obvious exception of the excellent Apollo 13.Kubrick's superior directing skills are a large part of what makes this movie such a classic. The circular space station provides him with an opportunity to film some unique versions of his traditional tracking shots, and there is also something to be said about the way that he was able to make a menacing character out of a computer that had no features other than a monotonous voice and that unblinking red eye. The award winning special effects easily surpass the vast majority of the computer generated special effects used in science fiction films today, flawlessly creating a world of zero gravity and isolation. There were several different methods that were successfully utilized in order to create a convincing outer space setting, such as near constant tilted frames, amazingly effective rotating sets, ever present humming sounds from the machinery, among other strange sounds, as well as the slowness of everything, which is present throughout the entire film, at least the entire film after that world famous jump cut.Speaking of which, I think that the cut from the bone flying through the air to the space ship floating through space was not done as well as it could have been. I think that the cut should have come a few frames sooner, when the bone had just started moving downward, so that the cut would be smoother, with the slow moving space ship. The story that follows also poses the question of how the monolith got to the moon, and even whether or not it is the same monolith as the Neanderthals found in the powerful Dawn of Man sequence. Was it really put there by an extraterrestrial species? Was it capable of moving on its own? What exactly was the effect that it had on individuals who came into contact with it? In the Dawn of Man sequence, it seemed that it gave at least one of the Neanderthals the intelligence burst of learning how to use something as a tool(or a weapon, in this case). But later in the film, it seems to have not only an intelligence (as it screams just before being photographed), but it has a less readily identifiable effect on humans  in particular, on Dave Bowman. Dave is in space near Jupiter, he goes through some sort of warp, and suddenly he is in a strange mansion, and soon there are a number of editing tricks in which Dave sees his older self, and then becomes that older self. Soon, he is so old that he is barely alive, and the monolith appears in the huge bedroom in which he lies. He slowly reaches out to it, and then turns into that famous mystical fetus that this film has come to be famous for.Does this mean that the monolith is some sort of evolution stimulant? Did Dave evolve beyond present human kind to a state above the inconveniences of these vulnerable human bodies that we all possess? Who knows? Maybe Stanley Kubrick doesn't even know, but that's really not the point here. The point is that the movie really makes you think  and not just about the meaning of the monolith, but also about the underlying theme about man vs. machine. 2001: A Space Odyssey is famous for a lot of things. It's famous because it was directed by Stanley Kubrick, of course, but also for a lot of other things - the opening sequence, that jump cut, the mysterious monolith, the realness of it all, even for the look of the Jupiter spaceship, which bears a strange resemblance to the Even Horizon. The sequel, 2010, clears up some of the mystery of this film, but even though that film is very good (although not as good as this one), that tying up of loose ends is not necessary for 2001 to remain one of the best and most fascinating science fiction films ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Sci-Fi"
