Just as good as the original.,"Just as good the original, in my opinion. Any sequel-slack was ironed out with Dustin Hoffman's sidesplitting performance. I'm really surprised to see so many people find this an unworthy sequel... it's more of what made the original funny with just enough additions to keep it fresh.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
His first word...,"'Meet The Fockers (2004)' may be similar in premise to its predecessor, but it feels distinct enough to work as a sequel and is the natural extension of the series' core concept. Pitting in-laws against in-laws is a solid idea, especially when you have a cast as good as this. I mean, who doesn't want to see De Niro get body slammed by Hoffman? The picture is a good time throughout. It amps up the slapstick ever-so-slightly but it still remains relatively grounded and relatable. It's properly funny, too; it may actually be funnier than the first flick. Overall, it's a solid comedy with memorable characters and classic comedic beats. It's really enjoyable. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
An extension of the original film done bigger but to lesser effect,"Firmly part of the circle of trust, Greg Focker is planning his marriage to Dina and has put off a big family get together for as long as he can. With no further excuses, Greg and Dina join Pam and Jack as they take their RV down to Florida to meet the Focker family. With an eye very much on his bloodline, Jack is keen to judge his future son-in-law by his parents, which spells problems when he finds himself living with two very liberal and touchy-feely Fockers.I'm in my thirties now and it probably is not very impressive that I can put words together in a basic sentence. Whereas for a two year old it might be a real surprise if they were to discuss their opinions on political matters as such with you. What is the difference? Well it is simply one of expectation. Coming to the subject of films, expectation can often make or break a film, with perhaps a poor Pauly Shore movie being better received by viewers than a poor Spielberg film partly because you expect that standard from the former but more from the latter. So it does help this film that with the very title you are informed that you are not about to witness the sharpest of comedies.With this in mind I went in with a forgiving eye, just hoping for laughs but I was not really prepared for how most of the film is unimaginative and base. In the first film we had Greg contrast with stern father Jack and hilarity ensues; here we have the same setup again but this time Greg is replaced as a device by his parents. What this means is that the film essentially aims at the same low targets as the first film and mostly hits them. To avoiding being too boorish on this subject I will admit that moments are funny and that the casting was a nice try but mostly I just found it obvious and dull. Toilet humour, a retread of the CIA stuff and so on supposedly provide the comedy while the drama is the same superficial relationship stuff as before.The cast mostly do their best to try and lift it. Stiller mugs along well enough but the real fun (such as it is) comes from De Niro and Hoffman. The former more or less just does his stuff again but is enjoyable enough, while the latter is at least having fun with a silly character. Streisand and Polo have lesser roles but still have a bit of fun, while poor Danner is just a plot device to try and the give the film some sort of centre. Cameos from Wilson and Nelson don't add much to proceedings and don't even get me starting on the annoying Pickren twins who are not only irritating but made more irritating by the way the film overuses them, apparently in the belief that ""Little Jack"" is funny and/or cute when really he is neither. Roach's direction is nothing short of pedestrian  even the choice of theme music is obvious and easy.Overall then this is a film that people who really liked the first film will enjoy. Those that just ""liked"" it may find that they didn't like it enough to watch it twice, which is what is happening here. The cast play it up as much as they can but really this is just an extension of the original idea done bigger but to lesser effect.",,Anonymous,Romance
Entertaining,"I beg to disagree with most of the critics on this one. I actually liked this movie a little better than 'Meet the Parents', and it is very rare for me to prefer a sequel to the original. There was some good acting in this movie, which is no wonder given the caliber of the cast. Make no mistake, this was definitely not a masterpiece, the script could have been better and the last 20 minutes of the film are a little overdone and cheesy, but all in all a decent, entertaining movie.One thing I found to be a little disturbing about this film is the message it sends, especially to the younger audience: 'It is wrong to be straight, to have strong principles and self-discipline (the Byrnes), whereas it is proper to have no inhibitions, no discipline, no job (somehow everybody is rich anyway) and the world is just a happy merry-go-round (the Fockers). Even coming from liberal Hollywood, this is still wrong.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
More Ben Stiller Comedy... I Know I've Had My Fill,"Gaylord Focker and Pam Byrnes are ready to be married, but first they think their parents ought to meet. Picking up where the first film left off, we now have another set of parents just as quirky as the first, giving us double the insanity. For fans of the first film, this should be a treat!For me, I'm getting my fill of Ben Stiller. He doesn't seem to really have a lot of range and his style isn't so amazing. What's the last great film he had? I loved ""Dodgeball"" and his cameos are always nice (""Happy Gilmore"", for example) but he seems to play the same guy over and over (Gaylord Focker really isn't much different from the Ben Stiller in ""There's Something About Mary"").Also, this film relies almost entirely on potty humor. Some people will really be happy about the humor, whereas I prefer a more witty and sarcastic film. Cats flushing toilets, sexual elderly people, fake breasts. Not my sort of thing, really.The film was a good pace, so it was easily watchable even if it wasn't my style. And the addition of Dustin Hoffman to the cast was great. Robert DeNiro really runs the plot (I think he overshadows Stiller on many occasions), but Dustin Hoffman is the gem here. (In a recent review for ""Stranger Than Fiction"", I say much the same thing. But it's true -- Hoffman has a subtlety about him where he blends perfectly into his roles and seems more lifelike than the rest of the cast.)Barbara Streisand was also nice, which is odd because she's Barbra Streisand. The rest of the cast was unremarkable (though I must give credit to the casting director or whoever found the Jorge character... great job).If you're into Ben Stiller and/or ""Meet The Parents"", you'll get something out of this. If you're like me, you probably won't. I watched it because I was visiting my father, otherwise it would never have been on my screen. And I can safely say having seen it I wouldn't have been missing out.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""I'm going to be PAM MARTHA FOCKER""","The sequel of MEET THE PARENTS was absolutely necessary since in the final of the first movie JACK said he wanted to meet the FOCKERS It's in the same line of the previous movie but now with the crazy (and I mean crazy!) FOCKERS. In fact I must say these characters BERNIE FOCKER (Dustin Hoffman) and ROZALIN FOCKER (Barbra Streisand) add something to the sequel; especially Dustin Hoffman, who does a very funny and unusual character. Like in MEET THE PARENTS there're lots of gags and funny scenes in this movie, with new elements and a new scenario, the FOCKERS' ISLAND! I did enjoy the first movie a little better, but I also enjoyed this one; and once again is proved that people so different can be part of same ""circle of trust"" many ""troubles"" later, of course!",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Star Power Overcomes Some Comic Weaknesses,"There are many movies where the performances are so good that the weaknesses of the movie itself are almost oblivious.The casting in this film, bringing together the stars of the original with Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand as Greg aka Gaylord Focker's parents, is sensational.While I admit that I believed I would read comments and reviews about the crudeness of the material, I believe the reason this is not a typically tragic Hollywood farce is due to the strength of the performances and the interaction of the characters.As you know, the premise of the movie is very simple. Prior to the wedding of Greg and Pam, the two families will meet. In typical Hollywood sequel fashion, we already know that the Byrnses are somewhat reserved, set in their ways. So it is no surprise that the Fockers are almost the complete opposite.Hilarity ensures, some crude, some overtly sexual. But the cast is skillful and it plays more like a comic version of ""Closer"". You will believe that Bernie and Roz (amazing performances by Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand) are Greg Focker's parents. Not only is their interaction genuine, their love for their child is as well. Part of Greg's embarrassment is the knowledge of his parents' ""quirks"" and how different they are from the Byrnses. Ben Stiller aptly conveys this while not backing down from his love for his parents.Meanwhile, stern Jack Byrnes scans the Fockers for clues to prove why he should not like them, therefore not allowing his daughter to be married into that family. His design of the RV is classic Jack Byrnes. What is an improvement in this film, is that Jack discovers some things about himself and his relationship with his wife and daughter that change him. This may be the funniest performance in Robert DeNiro's career.Throughout the film, there are themes that everyone has experienced but most of all, how important love is. The love of another and the love of family and friends. There is a very good example of this in a scene between Teri Polo and Ben Stiller, after some new information is exposed that could possibly tear them apart once again.All in all, when you know the cast is having a good time, the audience does too. I will be seeing this one more than once.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"The critics are wrong, this movie is funny","After convincing his fiancée's parents to allow them to marry, Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) now has to deal with what happens when her ex-CIA father Jack Byrnes (Robert De Niro) meets his own wacky ex-hippy parents, played by Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand.I really wanted to see this film when it was first announced. The original was very funny and it had a great repeat value. However, the reviews started coming in and they were all negative so I was a little discouraged. I still went to see it and it turned out to be very funny. The critics really need to lighten up since they turned away a fine comedy. Sure, some of the gags are old and tired but they still work. They use a lot of ""Focker"" jokes and of male nurse jokes sob that kind of got annoying but it wasn't an overload either. The story is pretty much the same as the first one except now Greg's parents are thrown into the mix and nothing ever goes right. The writers came up with a bunch of different, funny situations and some of them were recycled while others were new.The cast is great and they help move the film along nicely. The best was clearly Dustin Hoffman as Greg's dad. He was hilarious and fun to watch on screen. Ben Stiller was okay but his uptight character role is kind of getting annoying. Robert De Niro also gives a funny performance and he is now forgiven for appearing in Godsend. Barbara Streisand was surprisingly funny and bearable. I usually cannot stand her but she was alright in the movie. Blythe Danner gives a decent performance, nothing really special. Teri Polo was the only miscast in the movie. She just didn't fit or look well next to Hoffman, Stiller and De Niro. Owen Wilson makes a cameo and it was decent, a little unnecessary though.Jay Roach directs and he does a good job with the movie though it was a little too long. 115 minutes is kind of long for a comedy and because of the long running time, the film starts to bore around the end. They should have taken some things out to keep the film shorter and interesting. I also didn't like the character little Jack. He was the grandson of Jack (De Niro) and he was very annoying. The addition of the baby character was unnecessary and it kind of brought the film down. Compared to the original, the first one is funnier and more enjoyable. The second one is still pretty funny but it doesn't have a good repeat value. However, the film is still worth checking out in theaters. In the end, please ignore the critics and check this film out in theaters. Rating 7/10",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"We've Been ""Focker-ized""!","""Meet the Fockers"" sounds like ""Meet the f-u-u-"". Oops! Can't say that because of FCC guidelines. Just the same, the title pretty much describes the level of the humor in this Ben Stiller comedy. But that's redundant because it IS a Ben Stiller movie. Clearly my expectations for this movie were not high and, maybe because of that, I found ""Meet the Fockers"" quite funny.Don't get me wrong. This is not a movie for everyone. First off, the writers did not miss a single opportunity to play off of the name ""Focker"". It's silly and gets a little old but it somehow works with the other repetitious low-down gags.Focker is the family name for Greg (Focker), Ben Stiller. The funniest Fockers, however, (now I'm doing it) are Greg's parents Bernie and Roz, a loose and liberal Florida hippy couple still living in the last century and enjoying every minute of it. Dustin Hoffman, as Bernie displays a previously unrevealed talent for over the top comedy. Fitting perfectly with Hoffman's Bernie, is Barbra Streisand as Roz Focker, reminiscent of the ""zaftig"" Lainie Kazan. Bernie is a yesteryear lawyer who has not practiced since who knows when. Roz is the main breadwinner from her business as a sex therapist to the elderly.Greg is not too eager to reveal his parents' true nature to his fiancée's parents as they all come to visit to get to know one another better. Teri Polo nicely plays Greg's fiancée Pam. Robert DeNiro and Blythe Danner play her stiff and straight parents, Jack and Dina Byrnes. Oh  also add in some baby low-brow by Spencer and Bradley Pickeren, two adorable twins playing Little Jack.So, go low, go loose -- or don't go at all -- but if you like Ben Stiller, go see ""Meet the Fockers"". Dustin's antics will crack you up and you'll enjoy Barbra back on the big screen after so long. Rated a B+.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A more than worthy successor to Meet the Parents,"Meet the Fockers is not quite as good as its predecessor, but it is still very enjoyable with some brilliant cast additions that make for great comedy.Everything that was brilliant about the style of Meet the Parents is replicated in this sequel to great effect. Ben Stiller and De Niro are on fine form as expected, and the addition of Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand is inspired. They were so fantastic and their characters so well written.The plot is fun, although it feels slightly less fresh than Meet the Parent. This is my only real criticism.

Undemanding fodder redeemed by good performances,"Folks in the U.S. are apparently more sentimental than we hardier Euro types, or at least that's what Hollywood believes. So meet the Fockers has the obligatory feelgood ending when each and every loose end is neatly tied up in the final ten minutes (or it could have been eleven) and for this viewer rather left a rather artificial sugary taste to what at times was a quite inspired film. I must admit that I haven't seen the prequel Meet The Parents so I cannot say whether or not this is better, worse, as good as or as bad as that film. What I can say is that when Meet The Fockers scores, which it does do every so often, it is invariably the achievement of the five main characters. In other hands a pretty ordinary script might otherwise have made a truly dreadful film. Hoffman and Streisand in particular gell nicely as the quirky, hippy parents who son Ben Stiller loves but who he worries about so much when tight-arsed Jack is around. One nice touch was Dina, Jack's wife, who is shown to be a woman in her own right though a long-suffering wife. Overall this is par for the course, a standard Tinseltown comedy and its moments and occasional good jokes are down to the cast. Don't expect a great deal and you won't be disappointed. You'll get what this was always intended to be, undemanding fodder with a few laughs.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Meet the slightly inferior sequel.,"""It's nice, all of us being here together, don't you think?""Ben Stiller followed up the hit 2000 comedy Meet the Parents with a slightly lukewarm revisit of Gaylord Focker, this time with his own parents in tow. It's not as funny as the first movie, but it's also not a complete blight on the quality of the first film.The plot this time around revolves around the meeting of Greg's and Pam's parents, as the soon to be in-laws have yet to be introduced. As you could probably guess, Jack (a returning Robert De Niro) clashes with the free-spirited and unorthodox Bernie (Dustin Hoffman) and Roz (Barbra Streisand). Conflict and the occasional humorous situation results.With such a great cast, It's a little disappointing that this feels like such a re-tread, and that so many of jokes are hit or miss. Greg once again finds himself straying outside of the circle of trust, there are more jokes about him being a nurse, a dog that likes to hump things, and a baby who curses. It's a bit of an understatement to say that Meet the Fockers starts off slowly. Still, there are some laughs to be had, and at the very least, watching this will get you caught up on events before the third (and much funnier looking) movie in the series rolls into theaters this winter.Fans of the first movie or Ben Stiller should check this out, but you should also keep your expectations at a moderate level. The fresh faces add some fun, but the writing is a little stale.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Hilarious and Unapologetically Adult Comedy,"Prepare for another uproarious ride with Meet the Fockers, the side-splitting sequel to Meet the Parents. This comedy extravaganza had me laughing non-stop, delivering a fresh dose of humor and outrageous situations. However, be advised that this film, like its predecessor, is not intended for younger audiences.Meet the Fockers reunites us with Greg Focker (played by Ben Stiller) as he embarks on a new chapter of his life, introducing his fiancée's parents to his own eccentric and free-spirited parents, played by the comedic powerhouses Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand. The clash of personalities and comedic misunderstandings are taken to new heights, resulting in a relentless stream of laughter.Ben Stiller once again shines in his role, perfectly embodying the hapless Greg. His comedic timing and physical comedy skills continue to impress, generating uproarious laughter with every awkward encounter. Hoffman and Streisand are a comedic force to be reckoned with, infusing the film with their unique brand of humor and delivering memorable performances.The script is cleverly written, providing a plethora of witty and irreverent humor. The comedic situations are outrageous yet relatable, touching on themes of family dynamics, generational differences, and the challenges of blending two families together. The ensemble cast, including Robert De Niro and Teri Polo reprising their roles, further enhances the comedic experience.Meet the Fockers expertly balances its humor, incorporating everything from clever wordplay to physical gags. The comedy is unapologetically adult-oriented, embracing a brand of humor that may not be suitable for younger viewers. It is a comedy that revels in pushing boundaries and taking risks for the sake of laughter.Visually, the film is vibrant and colorful, capturing the zany energy of the Focker family and their unconventional lifestyle. The production design and costume choices add to the overall comedic atmosphere, creating a visually engaging experience.In conclusion, Meet the Fockers is a riotous comedy that will have you rolling in the aisles. The stellar performances, hilarious script, and bold comedic choices make it a worthy follow-up to its predecessor. Just remember to leave the kids at home and prepare to laugh until your sides hurt.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Not as good as the original, but its' still a satisfying sequel!","MEET THE FOCKERS made me laugh a lot. It probably has more laughs than the original, but the laughs aren't as big or as fresh or as subtle. And as sequels go, it contains many scenes that are mere variations of the original: the dinner gone wrong, the sports competition gone wrong, the pet gone wrong, the Owen Wilson cameo, the ""focker"" puns, etc. But many of the variations are quite inspired. Thanks to the terrific cast. De Niro, Stiller, Hoffman and Streisand all look like they're having a great time. Each is given a scene or two to really shine; De Niro and Hoffman fare the best. A child actor's also been added to the cast, and he's a scene-stealer. I just wish Blythe Danner (Mrs. Byrnes) and Teri Polo (Pam Focker) were given more to do. But, as entertaining as I thought the movie was, expect many critics to be turned off or pretend to be turned off by the numerous toilet jokes. I say, flock 'em!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A lot more crazy than the first film, but still very funny","Having finally managed to gain the approval of Pam's hard-to-please father Jack, Greg now has the daunting task of introducing his straight-laced no nonsense father-in-law to his rather eccentric parents. With both sets of parents being so different, will everyone be able to get along for a second time?With Greg's parents being so 'out there' Meet The Fockers is more outlandish and zany than its predecessor (and even occasionally veers into screwball territory). Some may say that the sequel is trying a little too hard and, to an extent, I agree, but for me a lot of the crazy antics that we witness are still very funny and there are plenty of new sight gags and jokes making the film still have enough qualities to act as a standalone sequel as opposed to a lazy rehash.Of course, it is still predictable; more so with how the film ends and in Jack's character arc, but in all fairness if a film makes me laugh then I don't care if I can see how things are going to transpire right from the start as long as the film makes me laugh (which this film did).The likes of Hoffman, Streisand, Stiller and De Niro are all on good form and play off one other very well. The direction and pacing are fast and frenetic meaning that the film is never dull.Those who enjoyed the first film are almost certain to enjoy this film which in my personal opinion is equally as good and just as funny as the first film.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A different kind of comedy than Meet the Parents,"Series note: As this is a direct continuation of Meet the Parents (2000), it is recommended that you watch that film first. It gives necessary background exposition and characterization for this film.Gaylord ""Greg"" Focker (Ben Stiller) and fiancée Pam Byrnes' (Teri Polo) wedding is fast approaching, and their parents still have not met each other. So Greg and Pam fly from Chicago to New York to meet her parents, Jack (Robert De Niro) and Dina (Blythe Danner), before heading off with them to Miami to meet his parents, Bernie (Dustin Hoffman) and Mother Focker Roz (Barbara Streisand). The problem is that the Byrnes are staid, conservative (though slightly crazy) types who would never think of showing public affection, while the Fockers are still hippies--she is a sex therapist for elderly couples and he's a lawyer who became Mr. Mom once Gaylord was born. Can Gaylord keep his parents reined in enough to not cause Jack blow his lid and try to stop the wedding? Although I didn't think Meet the Fockers was quite as funny or successful as Meet the Parents, it's still funny and successful, with a bit less of an emphasis on nonstop outrageous humor and a bit more of an emphasis on the often amusing complexities of extended family relationships.If you've seen Meet the Parents first--and you should--some of the material, such as Gaylord's job, jokes based on the ""Focker"" name, and even Jack's background and disposition will have less of an impact, which initially partially depends on novelty and surprise. Additionally, director Jay Roach and the writing team of James Herzfeld, Marc Hyman and John Hamburg telegraph quite a few of the punch lines. For just one example, it's obvious that something is going to happen to Gaylord's rental car in New York as soon as we hear him opt out of purchasing insurance, blowing it off as a ""scam"" to make money.On the other hand, Roach and crew make it clear from the start that they're not exactly shooting for the same style of film as Meet the Parents. This is evident from the beginning, which cleverly pokes fun at Meet the Parents' ""gradually going to hell in a handbasket"" style by having everything go exactly right.Roach aims for classic scenarios of families colliding that have surprisingly serious subtexts (and in the real world, these kinds of situations do have an attendant humor, at least when we're not right in the midst of them). Every family tends to have its own customs and norms, its own take on ethics, etiquette, politics, religion and so on. Naturally, when we try to merge families through marriages, uncomfortable, often embarrassing, and frequently tense situations abound. Aside from the humor, this is the crux of Meet the Fockers.Another important subtext that occurs in various guises through the film (and for which the potential was there in Meet the Parents even if it wasn't capitalized on in quite the same way) is opening up to ""free"", honest expression of one's thoughts, feelings and desires versus showing a ""proper"" public face. This is particularly amusing and poignant in the case of Jack, whose job involved obtaining honest expression, but who is the strongest case of putting on a false public face--to an extent that he's bought into the persona himself. In a way, Roach and crew are suggesting that if we can really reach that ideal self-expression, maybe those family mergers, and even other kinds of cultural encounters (such as the Fockers' run-in with the police) could proceed more smoothly.So it's not so important whether Meet the Fockers is as funny as Meet the Parents. Roach isn't just trying to make you laugh, even though he does so frequently. Despite all the comments in others' reviews about sex-oriented humor (how could you not expect that in a film with a title like this?), or general ""low-brow"" humor, the comic situations here are more sophisticated in many ways than a typical ""outrageous"" comedy. That means that you're not going to laugh out loud, with tears streaming down your face, as often as you're going to be sitting there with a big smile on your face watching scenarios such as Bernie trying, and mostly succeeding, to hold on to his hippie ideals no matter what the short term costs. This is more a humor of slightly exaggerated but realistic folly, played fabulously by a stellar cast.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
It was more fun with just the Byrnes but it's a good sequel.,"""Meet the Parents"" from 2000 was an unexpected hilarious and just great movie. It certainly was one of the most entertaining and fun comedies of recent years. A sequel was inferable but yet it took 4 years before ""Meet the Fockers"" hit the silver screen. Of course it's not being as good and hilarious as its predecessor, mostly because of the reason that it isn't very original and surprising anymore obviously but still ""Meet the Fockers"" manages to become a rather entertaining comedy to watch, without ever reaching the level of true greatness.Biggest power of the first movie was Robert De Niro, who was taking a comical turn with his role as the worst father in law you can wish for as a guy. In ""Meet the Fockers"" the focus is obviously being more as well on the Fockers. Even though this means that Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand get to show their comical sides, that doesn't mean that the movie is not double as hilarious. one plus one isn't always two.Still the movie has plenty of good comical moments in it. It's being original but most of the time it's also relying much on some of the running gags from the first movie. The movie at times gives too many winks as a reference toward the first movie, with as a result that this movie surely also isn't as much fun to watch once you haven't seen the first one.It doesn't really attempt to throw in some more story this time and it's also again mostly about morals but this is just fine. It isn't a preachy movie and the fact that it doesn't have a too complicated story ensures that you can just sit back and enjoy this movie for what it brings.A good comedy, as long if you're not expecting it to be as good as the first one.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Mediocre Storyline Saved By Inpeccable Acting,"Unlike the first film in the series, the plot in Meet The Fockers was a little lacklustre, without as much comedic accidents. In fact, I found myself predicting a lot of the outcomes and false accusations. Despite this, I must say that the acting frim each one of the actors was amazing. They really submersed themselves into their characters, and imput their real instinctual expressions and reactions.

De Niro as a comic lead? Why not!,"So in the first movie you had Ben Stillers character playing the main player. Or hero if you will. He was the one who had to go through all the trouble. A journey as some say. This time around, it's time for Robert De Niro's character has to go on a journey. His character has to evolve.And if you're fine with that idea, than you might enjoy the movie. Although the comic premise does promise many good things, not all are played out. But still it's funny enough. The new addition to the cast of the first movie fit in nicely. The Fockers (Dustin Hoffman and B. Streisand) are funny, although sometimes they do seem to overact a little bit. Of course they have to be the exact opposite of the Byrnes, because only then the humor works!

'Meet the Fockers' - Two Hours of Fun?,"I think -yes.I am not a big fan of sequels, toilet humor, and little dogs humping everything that moves, overdone baby jokes, ""Fockered"" jokes, and Ben Stiller. Barbra Streisand is not on my list of the favorite actors, either. But I saw ""Meet the Fockers"", I laughed out loud, I liked it a lot and I may see it again when it comes to cable or DVD. Dustin Hoffman was hilarious  wild and crazy; together with Streisand they made a great team. Streisand was very funny as a Jewish Mama (I am dying to say Mother Focker  but it's been said hundreds times already) - Sex Therapist for octogenarians.

Very Hilarious Sequel  Be Ready for a Non-Stop Laughing Mode,"In this very hilarious sequel, Gaylord Myron Focker (Ben Stiller), his pregnant fiancée Pamela Byrnes (Teri Polo), his future father-in-law and retired CIA agent Jack Byrnes (Robert De Niro) and his future mother-in-law Dina Byrnes (Blythe Danner) travel to Florida to visit Greg's parents, Bernie Focker (Dustin Hoffman) and the sex-therapist Roz Focker (Barbra Streisand). The dispute between the ""Focker-ized"" and very ""Zen"" family and the rigid and paranoid Jack Byrnes made me burst in a ""non-stop laughing"" mode not only along the movie, but also after, recalling the funny scenes and gags. The talent of Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro as comedians is very well-known by the audiences, but Dustin Hoffman surprised me how funny he is. Barbra Streisand is also excellent, and the jokes with the English word ""Focker"" are great. For my surprise, there are IMDb users that hated this movie, probably bitter people without sense of humor that unfortunately we stumble in our lives.

I mean I did have laughs and I loved the football and shot injections scenes but there wasn't enough hilarious parts to entertain me.

How many times can they make a focker joke in this sequel,"This movie in no way did the first justice. When the writers sat down I think the only thing discussed was how many times they could throw the word focker in the movie. Gregs last name was a humorous topic in Meet the Parents, but it really falls flat in the sequel. Every two minutes they try to spin off a joke about focker or gaylord and it seriously got old in the first two minutes of the sequel. As for the rest of the movie it was incredibly unbelievable. The reason Meet the Parents was so successful is because the audience can relate to Gregs situation meeting the parents and the unfortunate situations that come about. If you plan on seeing this movie I really hope you still go to stitches every time you here the word focker and do not mind a mediocre sequel with cheap laughs. The only time I laughed during this movie is when some guy fell down the steps and spilled his popcorn.And before I forget....If you cast a vote for this movie or any other please be realistic. Over 50% of the people who have casted a vote for this movie have given it a ten. How ignorant can you be. If you really think this movie is a classic I wonder how tough it was to grow up with an underdeveloped brain and would love to meet with you and discuss the brilliance that went into this movie. If you like the movie great, but don't skew the results so people actually think this is a classic.

A good sequel with the right amount of humor,"I was so thrilled when I heard they were making a sequel to Meet The parents because I loved that movie. And even though most of the times you get disappointed with sequels with this one I wasn't. It was totally in the line of its predecessor. Maybe not as good but still way better the thousands of other wannabe comedies. This time it's about meeting the parents of Gaylord Focker and if you know Jack Byrnes you know there will be problems when he meets the Fockers. The lifestyle of Bernie and Rozalie Focker (played by Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand) is quite the opposite of Jack Byrnes' lifestyle and vision and so it has to clash. Again the funniest moments are between De Niro and Stiller, even though I thought Hoffman was very funny too in some parts. A good sequel if you liked the first one. If you don't like Ben Stiller and his comedy then just skip the movie because that's all you are going to get.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pretty good--from someone who totally hated the original.,"Yes, I hated Meet the Parents. I was sick of De Niro's character after about five minutes. He works much better toned down in this film, but he's still annoying. But forget about him. This film works because of Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman. Hoffman sometimes takes it a little too far, but not as badly as De Niro did in the original. Streisand shows why she's still on the radar after an eight-year absence from the big screen, even a political conservative would have to admit it.The humor is still a little too lowbrow for me, but this was still better than a typical Jim Carrey movie (like Bruce Almighty. I also tired of the characters pushing the limits of polite conversation on their first meeting. Just because the Fockers are liberated aging hippies, doesn't mean that the film should resort to playing out like an episode of Dharma & Greg. I can stay home and watch that in reruns for free.I am sure a third installment will be made, maybe with Pam and Greg having a baby, and maybe De Niro will be toned down even more, but please let that be it! Note to the people of Jacksonville, Florida who were at my screening: Come on, was it really THAT funny? Didn't you see that blue dog in the commercial and trailers umpteen times? Oh well, if you enjoy a good guffaw simply for the sake of guffaw-ing, I won't rain on your parade.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Meet the 'So So's'    I hoped for more,"All in all, not a bad film entertainment wise however I expected something smarter with more humor and execution then there was.Seems Deniro's character lost most of his appeal as well as the whole film turning more into a, ""It's OK...they really liked these characters and situation so much, we don't have to work on it as hard and tons of people will still fill the box office"" kinda film.Dustin Hoffman was the most talented of the players and I'm not particularly a fan of his and he entertained me more. Barbra... she should have pick a different film because she came off like a dusty IL' sports car with flat tires and cobwebs yet, no matter how dilapidated it looks, underneath you still believes there's a sports car in there somewhere but it is what ya see, if ya know what I'm talking about.We could have used Stiller stepping it up to keep things really interesting and pick up the slack yet they wrote him a bit toward the back and thats too bad.Just with all the talent and pull they had behind this to make it 'really' funny and entertaining, you'd think they would have. Yet a gun with no bullets is still just a hunk of metal. Naw, they weren't shooting blanks yet the powder was a bit too wet for me.Most of you will probably be happy saying your money was spent well, yet I believe those more hardcore watchers not wanting just a cookie cutter production will be disappointed a bit with the results.6.5 outta 10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Trashy, Juvenile Comedy","I just saw this movie yesterday and I was appalled at it. All of the humor in this movie is dirty, juvenile trash, with nothing the least bit clever or unique. The humor of this entire movie is every bit as shallow as the Focker/F***er pun that the title implies. It was particularly sad to see talented actors such as Robert Deniro and Dustin Hoffman try hopelessly to restart their now-pathetic careers with this sub-standard vehicle for Ben Stiller (who keeps repeating his ""There's Something About Mary"" role). The whole situation between Robert Deniro's character and the little baby nephew was just tedious and unfunny, and the fact that the movie tries to generate laughs by showing a baby picking up on foul language from others shows how low the writers went for humor. And Barbra Streisand is just outright annoying. Overall, this movie is just a jumble of desperate toilet humor, and sex jokes, and is a complete disgrace.",,Anonymous,Romance
"ah, family gatherings...","By now, we should know that in movies, when WASPs meet ethnic people, there are some wacko situations, as ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" showed. But when the ethnic people are Jews, then it really gets crazy.""Meet the Fockers"" makes use of this. Having been accepted by the Byrneses, Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) decides to introduce them to his parents in Florida. His parents are Bernie (Dustin Hoffman), who distrusts the government, and Roz (Barbra Streisand), a sex therapist. The Byrneses are very laid back, to say the least, and after a little while with the very open Fockers, Jack (Robert DeNiro) once again starts considering Greg unfit for his daughter Pam (Teri Polo), especially since he and Dina (Blythe Danner) are trying to raise their grandson to be tough, while Bernie and Roz want to dote on him as they did Greg.Watching this movie, I had to wonder what kind of parents Bernie and Roz were to name their son like they did. Of course, all the Focker relatives had embarrassing names. What a family! The movie is mostly an excuse to be silly, and silly it was. But the good kind of silly. I just wonder how it would be to experience the Byrnes-Focker reunion. Either way, ""Meet the Fockers"" is hilarious.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Don't bother with the Fockers - See the original,"Meet the Fockers boasts an all-star cast, a box-office gold premise, and after all, it is the sequel to Meet the Parents. Why wouldn't you want to see it? Truth be told, it's not a bad movie. Actually, it's better than most of the run-of-the-mill comedies that get made these days. The problem with making sequels to successful movies is that the standard has been raised to heights not likely to be past. That's why you make sequels to movies like The Princess Diaries that have a built in audience already and weren't that great the first time around. If the sequel is better, both films benefit.The problem with this film lies in its desire to milk its built in jokes to death. This is essentially cheating in the comic department. It means you're too lazy to work for new laughs. Of course, if you are the follow up to Meet the Parents, you have to have a token Focker or Jinxy joke. What makes a movie, book, TV show or conversation memorable, however, is something unique. You need to conquer new territory and claim it as your own.Everyone is back form the first film. Jack is still the leader and Dina the token wife figure. Greg, or Gaylord as he is referred to now, still suffers the male nurse jokes and, as sweet as he is, we don't know how Pam puts up with all that he does. His mistakes can be forgiven but after a while you reach a point where it's overkill and even the audience is embarrassed. And speaking of embarrassed, there are the Fockers, Bernie and Roz. Not only do you have to wonder why Greg would ever let anyone meet these people but you also have to wonder how they don't notice that not everyone is as open and comfortable with their lifestyle. For example, Roz is a sex therapist who holds class in their backyard. You would think these people had never met a conservative before.There is no lack of sex humor here. In fact, often it's not humor but just a mention of Greg's deflowering with the Spanish maid when he was fifteen. Or the thumbing though Greg's baby pictures only to end up with his foreskin in the fondue pot. This is how every scene progresses, and while it's funny at first, after a time you begin to wonder how old the screenwriters are.Although those evolved could probably have had a more fulfilling experience doing another film, their careers will probably be momentarily boosted by this. People like this type of film and it is a nice escape. After all, it's far from reality. My rating is for the great cast and the over all good effort but the film has the fate of the $5 bin. ***/*****",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Better than the first,"This is an incredibly funny movie. I can't believe the lackluster reviews that this film has received. It's one of the most consistently funny films to come out in recent memory. I (and the rest of the audience for that matter) laughed hardily throughout. Dustin Hoffman, Robert Deniro and Ben Stiller are great. The female characters aren't given much to do, but give adequate performances. Not being a Streisand fan, I was a little apprehensive about her casting, but am pleased to say that she is very good in the role and stands toe-to-toe with hubby Hoffman. The movie is quickly paced and provides very little ""down time"" where the comedy bogs down. It's a great mix of slap-stick, witty banter, strong comedic performances, crude humor and even cutesy fowl mouthed toddlers. To me all these high brow critics need to lighten up. Comedies should be judged by whether or not they are funny and that's it. The bottom line with this film is that it's hilarious.

So why did I just see him in Hide and Seek...well, anyway he was much better in Hide and Seek. Meet the Fockers is funny and I like Ben Stiller, but he has become a one-trick-pony. He needs to stretch a little beyond the nebbish/putz image. De Niro was so irritating in this, but to be fair the rest of the cast made it watchable.

Those In-Laws,"In Meet The Parents Ben Stiller had to win the trust of Robert DeNiro and Blythe Danner the parents of his girl friend Teri Polo, that famed 'circle of trust' in the Byrnes family. Now the whole family is going to Florida where Stiller's parents the Fockers have a palatial estate and ideas that definitely run counter to those espoused by DeNiro.That opposition is the basis of the wonderful comedy in this sequel to Meet The Parents. With the casting of Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand as Stiller's parents, Meet The Fockers is as funny, maybe funnier than the original film.A whole lot of Focker family secrets are exposed in this comedy and with three of the biggest movie names in the past 40 years in the cast there was definitely built in box office. DeNiro, Hoffman, and Streisand show some incredible comic timing in this film.There's nothing these two families agree on. Even down to the fact that Hoffman's a dog person and DeNiro a cat person is humorous material. The cat turning on the dog in the DeNiro/Danner trailer is a memorable scene.Another favorite of mine are the touch football sequence. I doubt Kennedy family touch football was ever like this. There's also a memorable encounter with a Barney Fife like deputy where DeNiro, Hoffman, and Stiller all go to the pokey. Oddly enough Danner and Streisand hit it off well. Streisand is a sex therapist and makes good money doing it as we see by the way the Fockers live. In fact Hoffman though a lawyer became a stay at home dad. That really gets super macho DeNiro's dander up.Fans of any and all of the players here should make Meet The Fockers a must for your viewing list.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good follow up,"It's time to meet the Fockers (Barbara Streisand and Dustin Hoffman) are Greg's parents, they are a fun loving, open minded and free spirited; basically the complete opposite of Pam's parents, and just maybe getting them together isn't such a great idea after all.Once again De Niro and Stiller play off each other well, but we also have the added injection of humour from Hoffman and Striesand, who clash hilariously with De Niro's stuck up character.There's plenty of fresh material, a similar yet still entertaining story and a fine cast that really performs. This is a strong sequel, and its only a little off the pace of the first.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Life-support machine for DreamWorks.,"Like virtually all mainstream releases, *Meet the Fockers* is, of course, really too awful to warrant an amateur review: only the professionals should be forced to deal with the dreary task. But a movie whose cast includes Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman, and Barbra Streisand would SEEM to invite discussion. Thirty years ago, such a cast would have indicated a Major Motion Picture. In 2005, I'm sorry to report that these living-legend actors have been inducted -- however profitably to themselves -- in the ongoing mission to Keep DreamWorks Afloat. The Stiller/De Niro ""franchise"" has officially joined the *Shrek* series as an anomalous money-maker for the studio. The creative bankruptcy of Messrs. Spielberg, Geffen, and Katzenberg resulted in the demise of both the TV and music units of the company; and as for the movie-wing of the operation, that creative bankruptcy has never been more clearly demonstrated than with *Meet the Fockers*.But, as I've said, *Fockers* appears to be making a lot of box-office dough, so the sheer awfulness is likely to continue. Expect *Fockers 3* and maybe even a *Fockers 4*. (Expect the same for *Shrek*, too.) In fact, the sequels may go on and on until somebody over at DreamWorks finds a way to concoct a good movie. Or maybe Spielberg will occasionally drag himself into the director's chair and put the aging Toms -- Hanks or Cruise -- through the motions of the occasional spurious blockbuster.I realize I've not talked much about the movie itself, but why bother? The first film of the series, *Meet the Parents*, at least had the chemistry between De Niro and Stiller, and an overall funny premise: the nice Jewish guy desperately trying to fit into the suburban milieu of a pathologically WASPish family. The Stiller character's all-too-human propensity for telling white-lie upon white-lie complicated his troubles and increased the comedy. In *Fockers*, Stiller and De Niro are curiously muted in their (few) scenes together. One wonders if they were getting along on the set. But on the other hand, the movie isn't focused on their interpersonal dynamic anyway, choosing instead to make De Niro the put-upon character, overwhelming him with the stereotypical ""earthiness"" (i.e., ""Jewishness"", I suppose) of the Focker parents. This diminishment of De Niro totally misses the point of what worked in the first movie, which is that he was a larger-than-life maniac whose expectations were so high that nobody, especially not Ben Stiller, could hope to match them.As for Hoffman and Streisand, they bring nothing unique to their stereotypical roles: any pair of aging actors would have sufficed. The fact that they're introduced by way of an answering machine only cements their irrelevance. I even doubt that they've enhanced the box-office profits, as most people under the age of 30 scarcely know who they are, anyway -- Hoffman and Streisand haven't been major screen presences for some time. Which brings me back to De Niro: he had better play *King Lear* or its contemporary equivalent, and do it fast. One tires of watching this great actor continue to trash his legacy with these god-awful comedies. He needs to remind us that he was once considered the greatest screen actor since Brando. (But then, Brando ended up as a joke, too. Curse of *The Godfather*, perhaps?)1 star out of 10.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
A slapstick sitcom version that is a shadow of its predecessor,"When you're making a sequel to a very successful movie, you've really got a lot to live up to. Some sequels take that challenge and work hard to live up to or exceed expectations. Even if the sequel doesn't exceed the original, you hope it'll at least give a valiant effort. Meet the Fockers, however, went with a different approach. It takes everything that worked in the first movie, throws it out the door, and substitutes it with lame, formulaic, and repetitive gags.Don't believe me? Here are a few jokes that were not only run into the ground, but were buried 10 feet beneath it and covered with cement: * A dog humping stuff. Is that still considered funny? If you think so, then is it funny to repeat the gag about 5 times WITHIN ONE MOVIE??? If you think so, then may I ask why you set your comedic bar so low? * Barbra Streisand is a sex therapist. Oooh look, she works with old people! She teaches them how to lap dance! Hardy har. I wasn't able to laugh at that because I was too busy trying to avoid throwing up on the person sitting in front of me. Plus, Streisand has lots of sex books and statues, so you know that's rife with unoriginal jokes that we've seen plenty of times in other less-than-spectacular movies. And folks, the last thing I needed to see in life was Streisand's boobs covered in whip cream. Sheesh. Well, maybe that's not the *last* thing I needed to see, but it's not high on my list.* Dustin Hoffman is a big IL' goof-ball! Wackiness and goofiness is fine, but within the context of this movie it would've worked better if it were done in a believable fashion. Hoffman's character sits on the toilet while De Niro takes a shower ... IN THE SAME BATHROOM! Is that believable? Hoffman's character used to be a lawyer, so you'd assume he'd have some sort of intelligence. Now if De Niro had gotten out of the shower and straight-up kicked Hoffman in the face, then THAT would've been funny, but he just politely asks for some privacy. And come on, am I really expected to laugh when Hoffman dances and falls into a food table? That's the best the writers could come up with? I suppose that might work in a high school skit on ""club day,"" but it really doesn't cut it when you're making a major motion picture.* The overuse of puns on the ""Focker"" name. Been there, done that. Something new, clever, and original would've been nice.There was a lot of potential here. You knew Stiller's parents had to be crazy, so there was room for loads of laughs once they met up with Mr. CIA Robert De Niro. Unfortunately, it's a concept that is much better in theory than it was in its execution. Hoffman and Streisand just didn't do it for me, plus the fact that I inherently dislike Streisand didn't help.I still think they should've used Jerry Stiller (Ben's real dad) and Estelle Harris. If you remember, they were George Costanza's parents on Seinfeld, and they're two of the most dysfunctional parents to ever appear on television. I think they (or two characters who were similarly neurotic) would've worked much better.There are some laughs here but nothing to compare to the original. I was never really bored, but I never did more than politely chuckle or smile. Were my expectations too high? Not really because I didn't expect this to be as good as the first. My main disappointment comes from knowing that this *could* have been really good.I know a lot of people at the screening really enjoyed it. I guess some people are just more willing to settle for a slapstick sitcom version that is a shadow of its predecessor than I am.THE GIST Meet the Fockers isn't horrible, and I never felt compelled to sprint for the exit (except for when Streisand was teaching the old people how to lap dance), but there just aren't any sidesplitting, aisle-rolling guffaws here. If you don't set your comedic bar very high, then you may be satisfied. But if, like me, you're a big fan of Meet the Parents, then you, like I, might be sorely disappointed with this sequel.I would suggest waiting to make this a rental, but if you're dying to see it on the big screen then make it a matinée.",,Anonymous,Romance

What was the baby's sign for a change of diapers?,"To think that ""Meet the Fockers"" went to become one of America's highest grossing films that came out during the Christmas holidays, is a tribute to the people that had the foresight and business acumen to think they had a sure hit with this sequel to ""Meet the Parents"" The director, Jay Roach, capitalizes on his prior work. In this one, by juxtaposing two different cultures, he must have thought sparks would fly all over the place. While the picture is mildly pleasant, it is still not as funny as it should have been with all the talented people he had on board.In a way, it's a sad state of affairs for some of the most best regarded actors of a generation ago to see themselves in this picture. We never thought we'd see the days when a Dustin Hoffman, or a Robert DeNiro would be reduced to playing these cardboard characters, or be in such a comedy that doesn't give us an indication of what excellent work they ever did in their careers.While in ""Meet the Parents"" there was a certain chemistry between Mr. DeNiro and Mr. Stiller, there's nothing of the sort in this one. Barbra Streisand is reduced to play a stereotype of a liberal sex therapist. While it might have looked good in the written page, it doesn't translate as anything funny on the screen. Blythe Danner doesn't have anything to do.In retrospect, this picture, like many others, are sold to the public by the well made trailers we saw before the actual film came out. They were much better and funnier. If there are any reasons for never attempting any sequel of an original comedy, ""Meet the Fockers"" would be the model to study.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Vastly inferior sequel has a few cute moments,"(Spoiler) Meet The Parents was one of the funniest movies of the decade, as we witnessed put-upon everyman Ben Stiller terrorized by every guy's nightmare, the over-protective father-in-law, ready to believe the worst at all times, played famously by Robert DeNiro. There were a couple of slapstick scenes in the film that I still laugh at after numerous viewings, and much of the interaction rang true between Stiller and DeNiro. Nothing really rings true in Meet The Fockers, as the conflict between Stiller and DeNiro is replaced by Greg Focker's zany parents, played by Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand. Hoffman and Streisand play likable enough characters, but don't seem too likely to have raised a kid like Greg. Their over-sexed, ultra-liberal characters are kind of charming, but not really laugh out loud funny. Director Jay Roach then goes for the lowest common denominator--the cute baby. Jack is now overly obsessed with his grandson, and the movie continuously cuts to his reaction shots--he cries when Greg talks to him, he laughs when someone gets kicked in the groin, etc. He also says a profanity for his first word, and repeats it constantly. I found it kind of stupid the first time. You can practically see the kid's mother/father offscreen coaching him through the word. Ben Stiller repeats his Along Came Polly/There's Something About Mary/Meet The Parents persona, but he gets shoved to the background a little in favor of Hoffman and Streisand, and it costs the film big. Sequels are good, even great, when there's more story to tell--but this just solidifies the notion that comedies should just quit while they're ahead.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

The standard crew from the first installment (the engaged Ben Stiller and Teri Polo and Polo's parents Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner) take to the road in a massively large recreational vehicle to meet Stiller's parents (Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand).

Meet the Fockers (2004) **1/2,"Not as good as MEET THE PARENTS, but still a decent sequel with star power going for it if not the most clever gag writing.I enjoyed the first film and yet found myself shifting back and forth during the course of this follow-up; I was chuckling one minute but then shaking my head the next, wondering why too much of the material tended to rely on cheap sex jokes and non-clever toilet humor (I'm no prude but jeez - can anyone write ANYTHING else for a laugh these days?). It also felt as though there were too many obvious references to routines that worked well already in the original, just to let you know the filmmakers didn't forget them.One thing is for certain -- Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand were ideally cast as Ben Stiller's parents, The Fockers. That in itself makes this sequel worth the watch. At times it was hard to swallow that any married couple could be so irresponsibly perverse and inconsiderate during such a crucial first meeting with their future in-laws, but then again I suppose that's supposed to provide the whole basis for this film's existence.

The Prudes meet the Perverts,"""Meet the Fockers"" is a semi-jovial, semi-obscene (and surprisingly crude) followup to its 2000 hilarious predecessor. While ""Parents"" featured the ungainly, hapless Greg (Stiller) taking pains to impress his soon-to-be in-laws the Byrnes (De Niro and Danner) with disastrous results, ""Fockers"" concentrates on the hysterical escapades of Greg and Pam's seemingly opposite parents: the Byrnes are prudent, stealthy, and leery, while the Fockers are, well... overzealous, excessively perverted, and free-spirited sunshiners; sounds like additional catastrophe for a Focker-Byrnes reunion! The Fockers (Dustin Hoffman, Barbra Streisand) enjoy partying and sexual innuendo, while the Byrnes (and mostly Jack) strive to familiarize an innocuous baby boy to the complexities and mendacities of the real world. So ensues a sometimes amusing, if frothy and sexually obscene(from the director of ""Austin Powers""!), which never quite achieves the shrewd ""comic scenarios"" that made its predecessor such an outrageous hit. It's a more zany and feudal affair, yet not necessarily laugh-out-loud hilarious. At times the Fockers Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand are more of an annoyance than a comedic relief, their propensities rife with the typical Hollywood overload of sexual innuendos and philosophical condescension, and I found their natures to be misplaced for a different genre of comedy other than an otherwise promising ""in-laws fiasco"". I would have rather enjoyed seeing these couples collide culturally and ethically, rather than the Fockers discussing their egregious intimate details at the table and around the house! Note to Mike Roach and writer John Hamburg: the original's premise of ""I'm watching you"" and ""Who's outwitting who"" was plenty more hilarious than ""I'll give you a massage"" and ""keep the hat on the door when you're getting it on"". There are moments of jovial comedy, ironically when DeNiro and Stiller are butting heads once again, with DeNiro determined to undermine and ruin his ""unworthy atrocity of a son-in-law""; the height of comedy is where DeNiro injects a truth-telling serum into Stiller and Stiller finds himself on stage making rabid confessions. My favorite character here is of course, Jack Byrnes, every guy's worst nightmare for a father-in-law, constantly intimidating and threatening, planting hidden cameras around the house, and investigating personal background searches to destroy any chances you may have with his precious daughter- and DeNiro is exceedingly brilliant in this part. ""Meet the Fockers"" is a comedy which perhaps attempts to overdo its ingenious predecessor in expanding its resources beyond the diligent cleverness and compatibility that propelled ""Parents"" in injecting a trashy sexual joke or two into a perfectly effective mix of humor. It entertains not when Hoffman (whose character, all things considered, is good-natured) and Streisand (to me, a contemptible character) ""get it on"" both verbally and physically, but rather, when we realize that the Byrnes and the Fockers are virtually incompatible, and the ex-CIA (Central Un-intelligent Agency, according to Bernie Focker) watchdog Jack Byrnes declares, ""I'm not so sure this wedding is a good idea. I don't like what I'm seeing from these Fockers."" All-in-all, a comedy that tries too hard to achieve unnecessary hilarity and spoils a perfectly entertaining and hysterical premise, yet still supplying some moments of the jovial genius that was the premise of ""Meet the Parents"". Maybe the third installment should be ""Meet the Kids"" or ""Meet the Dogs""... or perhaps the premise is expired enough. **1/2 out of ****",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sort of Funny,"This is one of those movies where you know there's been a joke and you're supposed to laugh, but you kind of have to make yourself do so. There are a couple of surprises but most of the gags can be seen a mile away unless you force yourself not to look. I think the performances were all pretty good but the writing just didn't deliver. Maybe it'd be funnier if I wasn't conservative, because the moral of the story is that conservatives, even national heroes like DeNeiro, are intolerant jerks that ruin the world for everyone else.Anyway, unless you have a lot of free time for somewhat funny fluff with lots of poop jokes and exploitation of babies who have been taught to swear, watch something worthwhile instead.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Better than the original--- this one is a true love story, with warmth, charm, and wit","Great sequel---I didn't care for the original very much. It was too negative, too many of the 'jokes' revolved around frustration, mishaps, and pain. Not my scene! But this second one was VERY good! I was especially surprised, and pleasantly, by Barbara Streisand's performance. I actually liked her. A LOT. The rest of the cast was outstanding as well. 'Meet the Fockers' had lots of jokes, but wasn't the 'madcap' zany freak-fest the first tried (and failed, ultimately) to be. This was more of a sustained wit. It also has charm, grace, and warmth. I found that surprising, because it is marketed (at least here in the UK) more as a slapstick job.It is not too much to say that this movie was actually somewhat of a love story--- and for the first time, I could actually see what the various characters might be seeing in each other. I was charmed, delighted, and completely won over. Good show!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
As good as the first,"Back in October 2000, Jay Roach teamed Ben Stiller with Robert DeNiro in the comedy Meet the Parents. The film was about an average man with an anything but average name that meets his girlfriend's parents for the first time. Expectations for the film were optimistic. DeNiro had hit box office gold teaming with Billy Crystal in Analyze This just one year previous and Dreamworks was hoping that their $50 million plus investment on a family comedy would pay dividends. No one expected the $330 million worldwide gross.So, since money makes studio executives dance un-rhythmically around the Hollywood sign, it is no surprise that four years later we are again following the misadventures of Gaylord Focker (Stiller) in the apt titled sequel, Meet the Fockers.Now in order to have a successful comedic sequel there are a few details on the checklist that need to be addressed:Number one: Get the original stars back for a second go-round. Check. This didn't seem to be much of a problem other than finding scheduling time amongst two of the hardest actors in Hollywood (DeNiro has been in 9 movies since Meet the Parents and Stiller 10 with 6 titles this year alone). The rest of the cast including Pam and Dina Byrnes (Teri Polo and Bylthe Danner) are thrust so far into the background, that they could have been replaced without notice. As an added bonus, director Jay Roach (Austin Powers) was back behind the camera, thus making the first day of production like a reunion rather than a workday.Number two: Advance the story. Check. At the conclusion of Meet the Parents, Focker was able to convince Jack Byrnes (DeNiro) of his sincerity towards his daughter  even though he had to go through a lie detector test to prove it. This time around, Focker introduces the two families before the wedding. Now that he has gained acceptance, can his parents win them over?Number Three: Try to strengthen the appeal with new characters, preferably Hollywood talent. Check. In what was a real coo for the producers, the Fockers are played by Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand who along with DeNiro make this movie the showcase for award winning performers. Also joining the cast is a small baby that speaks sign language and a dog that will be the fodder to the Byrnes' toilet flushing cat.And finally, number Four: Don't sway too far from what made the first film successful. Check. Unfortunately this is a check I wish the film didn't receive. The comparisons to the original are too blatant. The lie detector kit that was so prominent in the first installment is now a truth serum in the second. A pick-up football game replaces the water volleyball game and both pictures felt the need to show us bloody noses for some reason. About the only recurring idea that worked as fresh as the original is the variations of how to use Fockers in a sentence.Most of the laughs in Meet the Fockers comes from the parental Fockers. Although it is always good to see Streisand back on screen again (especially in a role that she seems to be having the time of her life portraying), it is Hoffman's weird and wacky Bernie Focker that elevates the film to any status. Whether he is lying in front of a mobile home in protest, wiping charcoal under his eyes before the final play of a football match or explaining how the toilets work, Hoffman hasn't been this good or this funny since Wag the Dog back in 1997.But where the strength of the bit/new characters are refreshing, it is the recurring characters and the unnecessary sub-plots that really divert this movie from rising above the crowd. And when Jack is able to go to his CIA office hidden below the bed in the mobile home, the movie sinks to a level of almost slapstick when the rest of the movie around it is better than that.Meet the Fockers was a welcome breath of fresh comedy during the final month of the year when heavy hitting drama vow for our spending dollar. Just don't to be expecting sidesplitting laughter. Instead, you will get a warm, meaningless comedy that will without doubt produce a trilogy if the movie makes anywhere close to the money of the first.Mother Focker anyone?www.gregsrants.com",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A focking waste of time and money,"Nothing new, nothing original, all about repeating whatever is done in the first one -- that's focking boring!!!! . Although it seems to be the trend of all the sequels for successful comedies, this one goes so surprisingly far ( or should I say close? ) that I can't believe this movie is brave enough to come out with everything from the first one except for the settings.And BTW, since when those film makers start to believe that disgusting equals funny? with Dustin Huffman's bare chest and Barbra Streisand's profession, which can remind you of those freaks on HBO's Real Sex series.... not to mention all those jokes revolving around a toilet bow....oh fock here goes my dinner...",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fantastic,"I think this movie was fantastic, it was absolutely great. There was tons of laughter, and it didn't drag on like most movies does. It wasn't the same old jokes, and it wasn't the same old boring continuation of Pam and Gaylords lifes, they actually had new story lines and something else because they were able to develop two new characters and give this something new. The characters were great, real funny material, they were real down to earth characters. Its cool how they took laid back people and matched them with pams parents, who are strict and uptight, makes for great comedy. Even the animals were freaking hilarious, not the same old story line where you make something else boring happen, this had life and was a great sequel. It was worth making the trip out in the freezing cold.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Entertaining comedy. Stiller does  it again,"Meet the Fockers or Meet the Parents 2. The Byrnes were the nice houshold around ex-CIA agent Jack we met in the first film. The Fockers are completely different. Father is not afraid of showing his feminine side and mother is an over enthousiastic sex therapist. And voilà: there is the fun.There are weird situations everywhere and some lame jokes, especially about the name Focker, and it is sometimes a bit overdone, but not in a bad way and I like these jokes. All in all this is a very nice comedy and it is definitely not boring. I am a fan of Stiller and his work and he does not disappoint me as the friendly but clumsy Gaylord Focker. He has perfected these kind of roles.Dustin Hoffman en Barbara Streisand are clearly enjoying themselves as the extravagant Fockers.I really enjoyed myself and Stiller is the man!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Poor retread of same old gags,"Initially, when I heard about this sequel a few years ago, I was kind of excited. The first film was enjoyable enough, with some true moments of 'laugh out loud' genius. As time moved on, I grew more and more concerned. The news of the Dustin Hoffman casting was decent enough, but Streisand concerned me. Then the trailers came, and I saw a few amusing moments, but a lot of repetition of the first film. Well, I can honestly say, with my hand on my heart, that I laughed more at Churchill: The Hollywood Years than Meet The Fockers! Picking up a few years after events of the first film, it is rapidly approaching the wedding and is about time for the parents of both families to meet. How will the uptight Jack (De Niro) cope when he meets the relaxed, and oversexed, Focker family? No doubt hilarity will ensue, and many hijinx will occur. Wellthat depends on your idea of hilarity. Here's a quick test for you Focker.Focker..Focker.Focker..Focker! Are you giggling like a madman? If so, this is the film for you! If not, and for some bizarre reason you don't find the constant repetition of the first films jokes funny, then just watch the trailer. You will save yourself 1 hour 55 mins, and will have seen all the best bit (which themselves are borrowed from other comedies). The comedy of the first simply suffers from being stretched out into another film, and somehow the magic is missing. Stiller and De Niro just seem to be going through the motions, and for some reason, despite the 'resolve the differences' ending of the last film, the relationship between the two is still strained.The news that a third film is being planned (Little Fockers) is distressing, to say the least, having seen what this film does with one 'comedy child' role! This is a film which shouldn't have been made, and the fact it did so well in the US reflects more on the popularity of the first than the quality of this dreadful sequel! It's like Father of the Bride 2 all over again! Dreadful!",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
good fun; love those Fockers,"Amusing and immensely likable follow-up to the 2000 smash Meet the Parents has bumbling male nurse Stiller introducing future in-laws De Niro and Danner to his parents, never dreaming that they're total opposites and the ensuing encounter will raise hell. Follows a formula similar to that of the original—in fact it's exactly the same—but manages to score big on laughs and charm thanks to an enjoyable script and a great cast. Streisand makes a welcomed return to the screen as the sensuous Mrs. Focker, but nobody has more fun than Hoffman who's a comic powerhouse as the blunt, lovably eccentric Mr. Focker. Nowhere near perfect, but a step up above most sequels. ***",,Anonymous,Romance
Hoffman at his best!,"In Ishtar, Hoffman was funny for about ten seconds. Here, Hoffman deserves an award for his comedic talent. He is not only the best thing about the movie, Hoffman gives one of his most interesting performances since the Graduate. Yes, this is not his ""Rain Man"" award winning role, but it is close to one of his best. As soon as h is introduced, everything Hoffman does is funny. Everything that comes out of his mouth is either a punch line or something so odd that you have to laugh at it. Everything else in the movie blends, but without Hoffman the movie is less than Meet the Parents. Instead, this is a sequel worth watching. It pushes the envelop in what to say and see. More outrageous that the first, Meet the Fockers is a great comedy because it has no rules. It is a comedy that will make you laugh. Promise.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Amusing, watchable, a few laugh-out-loud moments, and Hoffman and Streisand are a humorous addition -- but overall not as good as the original","""Meet the Fockers"" had a lot of potential but I think its downfall is that it never really goes anywhere. Clocking in at an hour and fifty-five minutes, it is not only longer than its predecessor, but repeats itself too often. In typical Jay Roach style, the director once again basically remakes his original film (also see the first ""Austin Powers"" sequel) through eerily similar scenes -- for example the football game in ""Fockers"" is a clear re-do of the water volleyball game in ""Parents,"" ending yet again with someone being injured -- but the film still manages to create just enough new gags to make it worthwhile. This is a generally amiable picture worthy of a night's entertainment. It is not, however, anywhere near as memorable as the first film -- which not only surprised me, but to this day lingers in my memory. (I still haven't forgotten the dinner sequence with the cat and the mother's ashes. That was brief comedic genius.) ""Meet the Fockers"" is just a bit too obvious. It's a sequel made for money. Its cast is obviously having a great time -- Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand are chewing up the scenery -- but it's far from a respectable and intelligent sequel. (Then again, who expected it to be?) Bottom line is: A fun movie, just not great.My biggest disappointment in ""Fockers"" is the transformation of De Niro's character, Jack Byrnes. In the original, Jack was a very strict disciplinarian, ex-CIA man. In ""Fockers"" De Niro seems to turn his original portrayal into a parody of itself -- Jack was believable in the original, to some degree, and here he is just a bit too broad to find convincing. Although the opening Democrat/Republican comparison between Hoffman's character Bernie (liberal Jewish) and Jack (uptight conservative) is pretty amusing, especially nowadays, it goes on a bit too long afterwards. At an hour and a half, we don't need another reminder than Hoffman is a liberal and De Niro's character is not. During this, Jack generally acts like a real jerk, and not only devolves past what he was in the first film, but becomes WORSE - he once again disbelieves Greg (Ben Stiller), and it's just sort of tiring because we've already been through this stuff in the first film.Also, perhaps it is just me, but I found De Niro a great deal less likable than he was in the first film. In that, there was a certain element of understanding attached to his actions -- in ""Fockers"" he really does just come across as a mean, sarcastic guy and although De Niro is still very funny, he's nowhere near as funny as he was in ""Parents,"" which built its laughs on absurdity in the face of realism, and not vice versa.""Fockers"" is a pleasant sequel that delivers enough entertainment for a Friday or Saturday night viewing. Hoffman in particular is an excellent addition to the series and not only has fun in his role, but delivers the most laughs. And his chemistry with De Niro is, once again, very funny. (Even more so than ""Wag the Dog."") But in the end, I thought to myself, ""Haven't I seen something like this already?"" And I realized a ""Meet the Little Focker"" better pull something new out of its hat or it's going to become a pretty tiresome ordeal. They should stop now, or come up with some new jokes -- the culture clash jokes can only remain funny so long....Overall rating: 3/5",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bigger and cruder,"Meet the Fockers is broader and cruder than the original which keeps proceedings fresh even as it goes through a lot of the same motions. It's very satisfying to see Robert De Niro be the odd one out here and this new dynamic combined with a greater selection of stars makes it a funny clashing of cultures as the old fashioned Byrnes meets free spirited Fockers.Ben Stiller plays it mostly straight in this one aside from the one standout truth bomb sequence, which nicely balances out all the insanity around him. With De Niro only committing to the bit even further and Dustin Hoffman & Barbara Streisand turning into a pair of loveable caricatures, it really feels like these films are a great place for dramatic actors to let loose.Jay Roach's direction mines the word Focker for every ounce of humour that can be mined from it and generally tones down the slapstick whilst dialling up the stupidity. There are definitely some luls between the good jokes however, the film has an overall warmth that allows it to coast between them easily enough and the jokes that do land really benefit from their unpredictability.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Charming, but you could play Battleship with all the hits and misses in this film","MEET THE PARENTS had to be one of the top comedies of 2000. Now, four years later the tables have turned as we ""meet the Fockers."" The humor has lowered a bit as we mostly are thrown sex joke after sex joke; however, the film is still enjoyable.Sequels like this only work if you liked the first round. Anyone who didn't like PARENTS will not find this endeavor any more appealing; however, fans of the original will most likely enjoy this offering.DeNiro is still the hard and ultra-serious character who does not find the Focker's particularly amusing. Stiller once again tries to impress Jack, but his immature plans only backfire. Danner is again funny as Pam's spacey mother who follows Jack but wishes he would lighten up. Polo is always present, but not as utilized as she was in the original. It's the addition of Hoffman and Streisand that give this film the charm it needs to stay afloat. The on screen energy the two show is addicting and it's great to see two people who really do love each other and are not afraid to show it, albeit, somewhat inappropriately at times. They are where the fun is at.FOCKERS at times tries a little too hard to be funny and at others hits the nail right on the head. For the most part the film balances hits and misses and does not disappoint, although this is definitely not the original. However, it is great to see these two spectrum end different families collide and come together.Overall, a charming effort, but one that will always live in the shadows of its predecessor, MEET THE FOCKERS rates a 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Sequel that compares to original,"Meet the Fockers is a good movie that has an outstanding cast. Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro, and Barbara Streisand are very funny. They intertwine subtle comedy with overt references, playing off each other. They seem to having fun, and the audience shares in the enjoyment.However, what makes the film truly funny, and allows it to rise above the rest of the typical comic fare is the pacing in the writing and by director Jay Roach. Roach's experience with the first film, as well as the Austin Powers series, helps guide the film by keeping the story on track. Shots are not wasted.I give it a 7 out of 10. Not as good as the first, though, in part because Owen Wilson is not a major player in this one.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Have a Focking good time!,"Alright alright, the choice of movie has to go ""downhill"" someday right? Well, everyone needs a crappy movie once in a while, especially when you're in need for some mindless entertainment.Mindless it indeed was, although not as lousy as I thought it would be. It certainly does have its moments, albeit in sporadic fashion. Some memorable gags aside (think foreskin and fondue), the film sometimes overly rely on playing around with the incredulous family name for several cheap jokes. The movie stars Ben Stiller as his usual loser-being-caught-in-ridiculous-situations self, and a strong veteran cast that includes Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand. The cast does an ""alright"" job, though I'm sure they are capable of much better performances. Have this sneaky feeling that they are merely going through the motions after pocketing their respective paychecks.One character who completely stole the thunder and grabbed all the attention from the others is none other than the impossibly cute and talented ""Little Jack"" as De Niro's grandson, played by real-life twins, Spencer and Bradley Pricken. The 2-3 year old toddlers' performances are nothing short of incredible... you just have to watch it for yourself! The fact that he alone was probably responsible for 30% of the laughs says a lot about how ""adequate"" the rest of the cast were.Disclaimer: I've not watched Meet the Parents before, so perhaps my judgment was affected?

The Moose Hole - 'Focker'ed Up!,"The story for Meet the Fockers no where near meets the magnificence or the brilliant humor of the original. Unlike Meet the Parents, in which the filmmakers simply ran with newfound ideas and allowed the storyline to flow consistently with little interruption, the sequel forces too much down the throats of its audience. It acts in the same way as the finale to The Matrix trilogy did in that the fanfare had built up so many ideas and theories as how it should be done that by the time it was released, no matter what would have been done or not, it was bound to disappoint someone. Sadly enough, this is the card Meet the Fockers is dealt having been released so long, nearly four years, after the original surprise hit.Both Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller return to the roles they made famous four years ago, Jack Byrnes, the ultra-conservative recently retired CIA agent, and Greg ""Gaylord"" Focker, the male nurse vying for Jack's daughter's hand in marriage. They work well together once again but not quite at the level they did in the original film. Perhaps since the audience knows how they act against each other already, there are not that many surprises left and therefore less tension and humor to present to the audience. Seeing the Focker family in all their humiliating glory is the most prominent reason why this film should never have made it off the drawing board. Sure, it is quite humorous to simply imagine all the possibilities that could have been developed from this group, but when actually taking the initiative and presenting them in fresh and blood forms in front of our faces, it turns out not to be quite as pleasing as we would have thought. Choosing Dustin Hoffman for the role of Greg's father, Bernie Focker, a former lawyer and stay-at-home father, may have seemed like quite an odd choice at first, especially considering he has not had much experience in the way of flat-out comedies such as this, but now we can see why the decision was made  the man is absolutely hilarious. Who knew a talented actor such as Hoffman had this sort of comedic talent inside of him? After witnessing his performance in this film, he should seriously consider doing more of these types of films as he works quite well at least in this character. Bernie acts as a direct representation of some of the best, if not the most blundering, aspects Greg possesses. He always seems to be doing his best to please everyone but no matter what he does or how hard he tries, it perpetually ends up going badly or embarrassing for someone. The exception here is that Bernie is more cool, collected, and sound about these types of situations then Greg is. For some reason or another, everyone on the planet, Ben Stiller above everyone else, thought Barbra Streisand should play the role of Greg's mother, Roz Focker, the sexual therapist for the elderly, in the highly anticipated sequel. Whether they truly desired to see her perform once again on screen for the first time in nearly nine years or if they had to seriously consider the most annoying and embarrassing liberal hippie and her name just kept automatically coming up, the point remains the same the she works only in limited capacities. Barbra, in a way representing the film as a whole, is laughable, but not so funny as to make her performance all that memorable or worth the price of repeated admission. Most of her jokes are sexual in nature and though some of them are decent gut-busters to begin with, they grow quite old as the film drags on until a certain point where they are no longer funny and are just disgusting.Overall, the sequel to the 2000 comedy smash-hit is not quite as horrific as the filmmakers certainly could have made it, but neither is it as exhilarating and original as the first film was either. Here is yet another prime example as to why Hollywood should be prevented from being so God damn greedy as to ruin a practically pristine and memorable stand-alone film as Meet the Parents with an unnecessary and vapid sequel. After such dismaying disasters as The Whole Ten Yards and Analysis That  another film starring Robert De Niro  you would think that studio executives would have gotten that message not to bite off more then they can chew. Meet the Fockers is so testable that it should be placed on a pike in front of the entrance of every movie studio in the state of California as a constant terrifying reminder that there are some things in this world that should never be tempered with  tangible stand-alone films most of all. Honestly, the only audience members that may ever receive personal satisfaction from this lack-luster sequel in any way whatsoever will be hardcore conservatives knowing that from now on they can refer to Barbra Streisand, the queen of the banshees in Hollywood, as Mother Focker, which is worth more then anyone will know. But considering they would have to endure seeing at least twenty minutes worth of footage with her cleavage blazoned on the screen, not to mention paying money to gouge out their own eyes, they do themselves a favor and not waste their money, or their eyes, on this. True, not all of Meet the Fockers is a complete disaster. In fact it does offer quite a few laughable moments but unfortunately most audience members will find themselves forcing a laugh rather then just letting loose as real comedies should have you do.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

The Inner Circle,"Director Jay Roach's ""Meet the Fockers"" is funnier than it's predecessor, ""Meet the Parents"" (also directed by Roach). Although it basically is a collection of outrageous gags, that really has no point. After watching the story on screen by John Hamburg and James Herzfeld, one leaves having laughed a lot, and remembering it was more or less about the future in-laws meeting. The jokes in ""Meet the Fockers"" are very funny, but not particularly clever. It is dominated by bathroom humor, and sex jokes. This is puzzling given the caliber of the casting.Ben Stiller returns as Greg (aka Gaylord) Focker, who is traveling with his fiancé, Pam (Teri Polo), along with her parents, Jack Byrnes (Robert DeNiro) and his wife Dina (Blythe Danner), to visit Greg's parents Bernie (Dustin Hoffman) and Roz (Barbara Streisand) in Florida. Of course the Fockers are the polar opposite of the Byrnes. Roz (Streisand) is a sex therapist for senior citizens which is introduced in a hilarious fashion. Bernie is an attorney of some sort. Recall that Jack Byrnes is a retired CIA operative, and Dina was a homemaker. To illustrate Jack's anal retentive instincts, we have his sign-language trained grandson, Little Jack (Spencer/Bradeley Pickren). Little Jack also has a nursing practice that is both hysterical, and a little creepy. Anyway, things do not go smoothly in the family bonding department. Ultimately, Greg is excluded from Jack's Inner Circle. There are some great gags involving fondue, family football, and truth serum. This time around Stiller's Greg is edgy and has more character. In ""Meet the Parents"" I found Greg an annoying spineless punk. I think he benefits more from this story, because he is the more normal character in this parental freak show. Hoffman, Streisand, and Danner are good. DeNiro as Jack is completely psycho. He pulls back in the end, but for the most part his Jack is unlikeable. This may have been a miscalculation.There will probably be another sequel. Though I really did not see the point of this one. Comedies are a funny thing. I think a classic comedy makes you laugh a whole lot, and at the same time has some sort of redeeming or human quality. ""Meet the Fockers"" is very funny, but is not a classic comedy.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hit and Miss,"This is a reasonable film which does make you laugh, it's main fault is the over reliance on the focker jokes, which quickly become repetitive and stale. The child actor part of the story as well as the dog and cat element I found TOTALLY unnecessary.Strong points are the interplay between the two families with a different sets of value priority. On the one had the fockers are open, like to hug and kiss, talk about sexuality, are proud of their child irrespective of material success. The other family the Byrnes are very uptight, reserved and dominated by a type Alpha male.This is where Streisand, Hoffman and in particular De Niro shine.

An entertaining sequel,"In this entertaining follow-up to the 2000 hit ""Meet the Parents,"" the Byrnes family goes to visit the parents of Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) and more trouble ensues. Robert De Niro is hilarious, and Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand, as the Fockers, bring zest and life to an otherwise formulaic script. There are some truly funny moments, and this is a worthy comedy that is almost as good as its predecessor, but it falls short due to a little too much raunchiness and not enough of the underlying themes of family love and bonding that made the original so special. The whole cast returns though, with everyone stepping comfortably back into their original roles. They try very hard to make the funniest movie ever, and they don't succeed. What results is just an average, funny, worthy trip to the movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Atrocious,"This movie is the pain. The only relief comes from the trained cast (less Ben Stiller which is playing his own style). If it weren't for the great actors playing in this movie, 5 minutes would have been more than enough. Anyway, trying to go all the way through almost two hours of distilled comedy-manure is quite an experience. All the jokes are forced, and the main quality of this particular movie is that you don't hear the background laughs you do on sitcoms.I can't say this is the worse comedy movie I've ever seen. There are certainly worse cases. Without Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman and the others (Ben Stiller not included) this one has a good chance of joining the rest of the candidates for worst comedy.Contact me with Questions, Comments or Suggestions ryitfork @ bitmail.ch",,Anonymous,Romance
Meet The Fockers,"I watched Meet The Fockers last night and found it to be pretty funny, but not AS good as Meet The Parents. There were quite a few laughs but in some scenes you just KNOW whats going to happen & that takes the fun out of that particular scene. Ben Stiller's character, Gaylord Focker, spent WAY too much time telling his parents to be themselves/to not be themselves. Come on, this is supposed to be a COMEDY (you know- ha ha funny funny), give some laughs, not a wanna-be heartfelt talk with the parents!! I think that personally I expected this movie to be 10 times better & funnier that Meet The Parents, but then again, isn't one of Ben Stiller's latest movie releases DodgeBall?? Perhaps he left his funny bone behind when he started filming that terrible movie.. Long story short, I thought Meet The Fockers was OK, but I'm disappointed I spent $9.00 on a movie ticket when I'd have much rather spent $3.50 at Hollywood Video & been able to pause to pee....",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
This movie is a hoot...but not as funny as the first one.,"There is a reason that this is not as funny as the first one: we expected it to be funnier! It is impossible to overcome the charm of the unknown, but the producers delivered the price of the ticket and a lot more with some good laughs. Of course, the plot and the situations were contrived, but who cares? This is a funny movie and I recommend it highly. One thing you should be aware of before going into this movie is that the emphasis is no longer on the relationship between Greg and his fiancée. The emphasis will be on the families that are interacting. If there is one thing that I would have done differently I would have made absolutely sure that Terry Polo was more of an integral part of this script. She is almost a prop and as solid of an actress as she is, it is almost a crime to waste that type of talent. Mr. Jinx, though, was his usually catty self and the movie rates highly with me personally for its charm and humor.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"More characters, more fun","""Meet the Parents"" was a movie that was pretty funny in both idiosyncratic and predictable ways: the series of blooper-reel situations can be pretty amusing, yet the resolution in the end is pretty predictable altogether.""Meet the Fockers"" is not so much different, except we now have even more quirky characters that are not just playing one-dimensional villain types. It doesn't have as many outrageous situations, but nevertheless I was constantly engaged in seeing what happens to the characters throughout the entire movie (not a usual feat in cinema nowadays). In fact, it was pretty interesting to delve deeper into each personality, all without having to sit through constant humiliation that was laid upon Greg Focker as in the former flick. The sequel is a slight upgrade to the original, and overall a nice silly fun with good laughs.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
All the Fockers You Can Handle!,"Meet the Fockers was one of the few sequels that blew it's predecessor out of the water. There was a lot more comedy bits in there and the funnier ones were not used in the trailers, making the movie more enjoyable than Meet the Parents. It was great how they shifted the conflict on DeNiro while still keeping Stiller as the main character/hero. At times I thought, the story was rushed with the pregnancy bit and the ending, but it was definitely needed in the movie. A great movie, and definitely one to get, even if you did not like the first one like I didn't. The one thing was, it never truly tied a loose end from the first movie in one bit, but it can get away with it.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The title of the movie is hilarious,"I've got both Meet the Parents and Fockers on DVD. Watched them numerous times and thought they were both funny. The title of this movie is hilarious and it's self-explanatory as to why. But this movie is basically just like the first one, but instead of Greg meeting Pam's parents, the latter's parents meet the former's parents. The movie shows you how difficult it can be for boyfriend and girlfriend to meet each other's families. It can be overwhelming for some couples to be introduced to family. But this movie just has hilarious moments where the Byrnes family doesn't approve of the Fockers. Jack Byrnes (Robert De Niro) also pokes fun at Greg's middle and last name as well as his past life and his family tree. It's just a hilarious fun movie and it's not really meant to be taken seriously. It's the perfect comedy movie to watch if you have recently engaged to somebody.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Meet the Typecast Actors,"Robert DeNiro as the straight-faced former CIA agent, Ben Stiller as the goofy yet lovable fall guy, Barbara Streisand as the annoying liberal hippie, and Dustin Hoffman as the wildly eccentric funny man with a heart of gold.Needless to say, the Meet the Fockers cast doesn't stretch the imagination of its audience by any means.However, as long as you're not looking for any Oscar-echelon performances or a Casablanca-caliber story, you will probably enjoy this movie as I did.What Meet the Fockers lacks in originality and style it makes up for ten-fold in star power and humor. Although much of the movies' comedy is situated around the premise of a worn pun and a sequence of unbelievable coincidences, it was fun to spend nearly two hours whisked away from the drag of terror alerts and suicide bombers to enjoy the hilarious although at times implausible antics that ensue in this second Jay Roach installment.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
worst movie i've ever seen,"Meet the Parents was a funny and original movie. Meet the Fockers was completely the opposite. Every joke in the movie is based around Gaylord Focker's name. Which got old in Meet the Parents. One thing that especially bothered me about this movie was Deniro's character, In Meet the Parents he was not trusting of Gaylord, and despised him. His main purpose was to make it so that Gaylord would stop dating his daughter. In Meet the Fockers, Deniro almost has a liking for Gaylord. If he didn't like him four years ago, and Gaylord is exactly the same, why would he like him now? That is one of the many unanswered questions of Meet the FOckers. ANother is, ""How did a movie starring Dustin Hoffman, Robert Deniro, and Ben Stiller turn out so bad?"" Another question is, ""Why did the movie makers feel it was necessary to Be so offensive?"" The Focker parents are just Jewish stereotypes, and extremely offensive. The father is a lawyer, and the mother is a sex therapist for seniors, is that not offensive and stereotypical? Also, the only two Hispanic Characters are a maid, and her son. And, of course she is a single mother. My final question is, ""How did a movie this bad make so much money?"" It was number one for at least four weeks straight. ""Why did so many people make the mistake I made by seeing this awful movie?""",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

A lot of fun if you don't expect too much...,"It's easy to get expectations too high for this movie, considering that ""Meet the Parents"" is now considered a modern classic, and this one has Streisand, Hoffman and De Niro, three people who've never made a movie together. (Although Hoffman and De Niro have worked together before, most notably in another comedy, ""Wag the Dog."") With that type of pedigree, you'd expect a Best Picture contender, and on that level it disappoints. It's not even as good as the first one, but it's still a lot of fun.In this one, Stiller, his fiancé and her parents (and their grandson, Little Jack) head to Florida to meet Greg's hippie-ish parents. Being on his home turf should make Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) feel more in control of his surroundings, but guess again as everything begins to spiral out of control for him, thanks partly to his well-meaning parents.Easily the two scene-stealers are Hoffman and Streisand, who have a lot of fun acting as over-the-top sexually-active and sexually-open parents. This, of course, turns Ben Stiller's parents-to-parents introductory weekend into a Freudian nightmare made worse by control freak Jack Byrnes (De Niro) and his ""circle of trust"" high standards.The movie goes further overboard with the toilet jokes this time than the first, something unnecessary considering the on-screen talent who were clearly having a lot of infectious fun making this film. In fact, Streisand clearly hasn't just let herself cut loose this way since her '70s comedies that co-starred Ryan O'Neal, yet she still isn't given enough to do. I could've lived with some scenes running longer if it meant more Barbra and fewer toilet jokes used as unneeded crutches. Hoffman, on the other hand, acts as if he could play Focker's dad forever and you actually find yourself looking forward to seeing him in the next scene.To sum it up...the movie isn't as great as its pedigree would suggest but it still entertains.

But sitting in the audience, I couldn't help but notice how disconnected this film was to everyone under 35. There were a few chuckles here and there but by and large, the jokes fall flat often and with resounding thuds. I think the best way to enjoy this film, kids, is to take your parents. Make it a nice family event. You might not be laughing but listening to your mom cackle should give you some pleasure. On a side note, it's becoming very clear to me that too many cooks in the kitchen is a good way to spoil a movie. The studio really needs to just sit down and say to one or two guys... we're going to trust you. Here's Robert DeNiro and Dustin Hoffman. Go have fun.

I think that the formula should be dropped and the general public should be treated in a less condescending way. One dimensional characters and see-through plots--- I wish that there were at least some liberties or steps taken to entertain the audience. They should add a laugh track and change the title to 'Mr. Ed the Movie' when the DVD release hits the stores and goes on the $7.99 rack. I needs some spice.

Meet The Fockers -  Feels retro...Feels fun!,"Meet the Fockers is a continuing saga of Meet the Parents. In this film, Pam Byrnes' (Teri Polo) parents, Dina and Jack, (Blythe Danner and Robert Di Niro) meet Greg/Gaylord Focker's (Ben Stiller) parents, Roz and Bernie (Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman). Greg, Pam, and Dina all road trip in Jack's custom RV, which looks more like a music band touring bus or ""liberty coach"" bus, accompanied by hidden CIA spy gadgetry. Roz and Bernie live in an eclectic tropical themed Miami home. Roz is a senior sex therapist, and Bernie is a retired trial attorney, who has found his touchy feely side, probably through his wife's advocacy of verbally and physically, expressing the emotional self. Barbra plays the role super. I feel like if she was asking me the intimate questions, like Dina, I actually wouldn't have any problem giving her answers, since her nature presents itself easy and helpful. Any over analysis would make me laugh in a good session of comic relief.When the families meet, it is sort of like the Flintstones  Wilma and Fred (Fockers) meet the Bunkers  Edith and Archie (Byrnes). As for Bernie, he is so out in left field that I can't quite pass shock before finding laughter. But really, I still find laughter. The last movie I saw him in was Confidence, so it could have slowed my creative leap reflexes. Dina is the usual attention starved wife, from her husband Jack, who now appears to have an obsessive/compulsive fetish, with caring for their grandchild, little Jack. I wish Dina had a stronger role, possibly showing how she can rise above pouting over her husband's lack of obvious intimacy, and finding something that she likes, that will in turn, somehow have him take a better notice to his failings, in intimately recognizing her, sort of in that Vanessa and Austin Powers type of mode. Greg is portrayed as too much of the underdog, by Jack's regimented routine and his mother's free sex style questioning. Further, he thinks that he might be the father, to the exotic Hispanic cook, Isabel's (Alana Ubach) son. Even his Dad's homemade Greg wall shrine completely embarrasses Greg. Poor Greg. (sounds good in Marsha tone.) We look at him having the most fun when he is injected with sodium penathol, by Jack, since for most of the movie, he is suffering from family idiosyncrasy overload. Poor Greg (in regular concerned tone.) Much of the comedy attempts to center jokes around little grandchild Jack, which seems to be an odd emphasis, and misdirection. Maybe it reflects the situation when parents or grandparents do not have much going on in their own lives, so a child becomes a center to their world, which is an obvious intended comic hook, to the film. But, the idea does not play out all too funny.The feeling of actor improvisation gives the film that more carefree and unscripted vibe, but nevertheless, the script in its entirety, never truly reaches full funny bone status, though good intentions are evidently prevalent. (How intellectually nerdy was that synopsis.) I enjoy all of these actors so much, and even more, for the fact that some having played serious roles, gladly warmed themselves up to moving, yet again, into the comedy role. The film may not have offered complete jelly-belly laughing humor to its audience, but it may have well offered ""senior"" sex tips to those in the frozen or frustration zone, thanks in part to the lead instructor, Roz! It's never too soon to start thinking about signing up for co-educational couples yoga.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
It's 80% as good as 'Parents',"'Meet the Parents' was the surprise hit of 2000. 'Meet the Fockers' will be a mediocre hit for late '04/early '05.This time around Greg has to introduce the Byrnes' to the Fockers, Greg's family. A stay-at-home dad played by Hoffman and a sex therapist for the elderly played by Streisand was a good way to portray the world's most embarrassing parents.I can't talk about this without ruining it or spoiling it so i'll just have to say if you laughed hard at the 'Parents' you'll at least laugh 80% that amount with the 'Fockers'. The only thing that takes away occasionally is that there may be TOO many sex jokes. This is sometimes unnecessary but then you think 'How could they be any MORE embarrassing?' you just throw in a sex joke that would make you turn red and cover your face as Greg 'Gaylord M.' Focker does through the whole movie. Definitely worth it for the laughs. Funnier than 'Along Came Polly', Definitely funnier than 'Envy' (that one was trash), Probably just as funny as 'Dodgeball' (maybe funnier). BUT, it is NOT funnier than 'Meet The Parents'. It is still a laugh riot, but again you're guaranteed 80% of the amount of laughs you got the first time. The downfall is sometimes the jokes are repetitive of the first. But you gotta love seeing it like the first time you saw the original. It's a great film filled with laughs but nothing too original or groundbreaking in comedy like the first.

Geat idea for another sequel...,"Just saw MTF and got a great idea for a sequel... the Fockers and the Ryans go on vacation to Europe where they run into all kinds of zany characters... Kenneth Branagh as a schizo prince...maybe Gary Oldman as a excessively flatulent cab driver...what a pity George C. Scott has passed on, in drag he could have been the perfect Grandma Focker. Seriously folks, the people who paired Deniro and Hoffman are to be praised...just think if they had been around long ago perhaps they could have gotten Shakespeare and Oscar Wilde to write together... perhaps they could have written dirty jokes or, even better, subway graffiti. Anyone who doesn't see this movie for the disgrace that it is has no business writing about film. To take two actors of this caliber and waste them on a souped up TV sitcom... well lets just say the producers should never be allowed to ATTEND another film much less make one. Marlon Brando left Hollywood, stopped making films, retreated to a desert island, gained 500 pounds and pretty much made a joke out of himself when his acting career essentially was over... too bad Robert Deniro couldn't have done the same.

Better than the first film...,"I'm going by my rating for the first Meet the... film when I say this one shades the first in terms of laughs because, to be honest, I remember very little of the initial outing. Maybe I was just in a more receptive mood when I saw this sequel - the humour is undoubtedly of the toilet variety - but I found myself chuckling out loud on a number of occasions while watching this which is something that doesn't happen too often these days.Dustin Hoffman makes the biggest impression with his laid-back hippyish father of the bridegroom, while Robert De Niro plays his familiar rigid stick-in-the-mud. De Niro doesn't come out of their interplay too well here to be honest; Hoffman easily overshadows him and he really looks like he's waiting for knocking-off time for much of the film. Mind you, that could be said for many of his performances these days: his choice of roles has proved fairly dubious since Di Caprio replaced him as Scorsese's favourite actor, and perhaps that's why he so often looks jaded on-screen.Barbra Streisand comes out of screen retirement to play Ben Stiller's sex therapist mother and you have to wonder why. Any number of competent (but less iconic) actresses could have played the role as there isn't really that much screen time - or laughs - given to her.While it might not manage to sustain its pace throughout its slightly over-long running time, Meet the Fokkers proves to be entertaining enough to prevent you from feeling you've been wasting your time.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

I wish that they had cast Ben's parents, Jerry Stiller and Ann Meara, as originally intended. That would have been much more entertaining.The sexual references were too much and to frequent.

The minimum age that a kid should see the movie (that is under 13) is at least 11. Kids might get only half of the jokes, but parents will be wetting their pants in laughter.

A pale shadow of the original,"Unfortunately, ""Meet the Fockers"" does not live up to the promise of its predecessor. The jokes are not particularly funny, the writing is loose and lacks direction, and it's clear nobody's having fun doing this -- it's purely a job for these actors, and an attempt to cash in on the original.All that said, the movie is not all that bad. It's mildly entertaining and occasionally engaging, but it really requires that you've seen ""Meet the Parents"" to fully enjoy it. Many of the jokes are unfortunately recycled from the original, and bits and pieces of ""Flirting with Disaster"" can also be found here and there. The film is like a collage of many past comedies, but in the context of the first film.

better than the first,"The sequel to the ever popular ""Meet the Parents."" I should probably mention that I'm not a fan of the first movie. I can't take humiliation comedy, and I only felt sympathy for poor George Focker (Stiller). Can we give the poor guy a break already? Nope. We're gonna make a sequel about his embarrassing parents.At the beginning of the movie we learn George and Pam (Polo) are planning their wedding. Now all that has to happen: Pam's parents, Jack (De Niro) and Dina (Danner), have to meet George's parents, Bernie (Hoffman) and Roz (Streisand). The movie ensues with more humiliation comedy put on poor George. However, the sequel actually has some heart.The Focker family made this movie really enjoyable for me. Streisand and Hoffman's characters were so charming. It's not that they intentionally wish to embarrass their son, they just REALLY love him. One of the jokes in the movie includes the parents ""shrine"" dedicated to their son's ""achievements."" This includes ""9th place ribbons"" and a trophy that reads ""world's greatest male nurse."" Bernie and Roz are the type of couple that are out there but see themselves as normal. Everyone else around them is just closed in and not in touch with their feelings. Now combine these two with De Niro's character. Instant laughs.Overall, I enjoyed ""Meet the Fockers"" much more than ""Meet the Parents."" I'm still not a big fan of humiliation comedy, but I still found myself enjoying this one. Therefore, I feel good giving this one my recommendation",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Terrific cast makes this picture fun!,"This sequel to the hit comedy MEET THE PARENTS exceeded everyone's wildest expectations when it grossed nearly $280 million at the US box office, and became the highest grossing live action comedy of all time. Although audiences seemed to love this lowbrow culture clash comedy, most film critics were seemingly merciless in their hatred of the film. In the end, the film is solidly enjoyable, and perhaps is even superior to the somewhat one-note original film. The picture ends up delivering more or less what it promises, so it's difficult to fathom exactly what type of movie that most critics and naysayers were expecting.The likable Ben Stiller had been on a hot streak of successful films for a good five years or so before the release of FOCKERS, and he has emerged into a remarkably good straight man - managing to find laughs without pushing too hard. Robert De Niro, unarguably one the screen's finest dramatic actors of all-time, has staged an amazing third-quarter career revival as a comedic actor in the last few years, and he has never appeared more comfortable playing comedic aggression as he does here. The film's major casting ace, however, is the dynamic one-two punch of Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand as Stiller's free-wheeling parents. Hoffman and Streisand literally radiate with an irresistibly genuine warmth and a combustible comedic energy that completely steals every scene in which they appear; if there is to be a third FOCKER film, I hope that Hoffman and Streisand are given the starring roles!If the film has a downside, it is certainly the often ho-hum nature of the script, which somehow manages to be somewhat unfocused and completely predictable at the same time. Also, I do wish that the film-makers had given the lovely Blythe Danner and Teri Polo more to do this time around, as they often seem heavily underutilized in the presence of heavy weights like De Niro, Hoffman, and Streisand. The film succeeds, however, thanks to it's ensemble of extremely likable character and it's powerhouse cast that overcomes even the most well-worn screenplay. While it will never be a critical favorite, MEET THE FOCKERS is an amusing, sometimes hilarious, farce that is much better than many of the so-called ""comedies"" of the last few years.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Almost a kitchen sink approach - throw in enough potentially funny bits and human and/or animal dynamics, and surely something will make em laugh. I did laugh 3 times during the film, but groaned and grimaced much more.Yes it looked like they were having fun doing such silly schlock, but for this to be Ms. Streisand's return to the screen - albeit alongside Dustin and DeNiro - it's a colossal letdown verging on sacrilege.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

There are numerous laughs, but also quite a few misses. Skip this one if you hated the original film.The GOOD. Amazing chemistry between Streisand and Hoffman. (They are obviously enjoying themselves.) Quite a few laughs. Great use of the baby for laughs.The BAD. The secret CIA activities are rather far-fetched. The extended DVD sequences are not worth watching. The willingness of Stiller's parents to embarrass him often become ridiculous. The ""mystery meat"" of the fondue was a bit much. The traffic cop sequence tried too hard to be humorous with stereotypes. The film often tries in vain with bathroom-type humor. Not as funny as the original.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Pathetic, nothing like Meet the Parents, waste of time",I was 100% disappointed. Meet the Fockers was nothing like Meet the Parents. Meet the Fockers was a pathetic movie with no imagination or creativity. Just the same old crude sex jokes that you see in 80% of the scum-filled garbage coming out of Hollywood. The writers for this movie must have the mind and maturity of a 12 year-old. The movie was primarily focused on lame sex jokes rather than developing a decent storyline. The acting was fair but the parts that were supposed to be funny were so absurd that nothing was funny about them. I don't think I laughed at all during the movie. It was a complete waste of time and I look forward to spreading the word.,1.0,Anonymous,Romance
quite funny but not on a level with the first,"""Meet the Parents"" was one of the best and most commercially successful mainstream comedies of recent years, a hilarious tale of a young man trying his damnedest to impress his prospective father-in-law - an ex-CIA agent with some mighty strange ideas about interpersonal relationships - and being thwarted at every turn.Now comes the sequel, ""Meet the Fockers,"" in which the young, affianced couple, Greg and Pam, take her parents, Jack and Dina Byrnes, to meet his parents, Bernie and Roz Focker, a pair of freethinking flower children left over from the '60's (she's a psychologist who specializes in sex therapy for geriatrics) who have little in common with the uptight, conservative Jack, a man with a few eccentricities of his own to account for.One of the reasons why ""Meet the Parents"" worked so well as a comedy was that, no matter how absurdly preposterous and slapstick-y the scenes became, the humor always remained rooted in a universal, believable premise. We always felt for Greg because we could identify with his predicament. By bringing in this second set of parents, ""Meet the Fockers"" begins to feel less like a human comedy and more like a strained sitcom, one in which the characters and situations become subordinated to the laughs and all sense of reality flies out the window. That's not necessarily a bad thing, since many of the jokes here are, indeed, very funny, but one still misses the heart that made the original film such a first-rate comic charmer.That being said, ""Meet the Fockers"" is still a lot of fun to watch, primarily thanks to the high-caliber cast that has been assembled for the occasion. Joining the original players - Ben Stiller, Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner - are Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand, two old pros who seem to be having the time of their professional lives plowing full-throttle through this material. The material itself is a bit on the crude side, with lines that are not quite sophisticated or subtle enough to qualify as double entendres. Add to that a few too many jokes about mammary gland function and scenes involving dog humping and you will quickly realize that the writers are aiming for a fairly low common denominator audience here (the title is the first dead give away, I suppose). Nevertheless, some of these bits do actually result in some genuine laugh-out-loud moments, thanks primarily to the caliber of the performances.No one will be confusing this with Oscar Wilde or George Bernard Shaw, that's for sure, but ""Meet the Fockers"" offers a fun time for those who prefer their comedy aimed a wee bit lower.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Not what I expected, but still funny...","MEET THE FOCKERS was the 2004 sequel to the surprise hit MEET THE PARENTS, in which Greg and Pam Focker (Ben Stiller and Teri Polo) along with Pam's parents (Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner) take a road trip with Pam's infant nephew, to meet Greg's parents, played by Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand. I must admit upon hearing there was going to be a sequel to MEET THE PARENTS, I expected something along the lines of watching Greg and Jack Burns (De Niro) learning how to get along as son-in-law and father-in-law, but this sequel skips right over that period of adjustment and has Greg and Jack almost friendly with each other as they prepare to meet their in-laws, who are nothing like the straight-laced Burns family. Bernie Focker (Hoffman) is a stay-at-home husband and wife Roz (Streisand) is a sexual therapist and naturally they are the polar opposites of Jack and Dina Burns, wild, free-spirited people who say what is on their mind at all times and don't seem to care if people hear them having sex in their bedroom. Personally, I think Hoffman practically steals this film as the fiercely loyal yet slightly demented Bernie Focker, whether it's defending his son's lack of scholastic achievements or working diligently at satisfying his wife's sexual appetite. Hoffman just seems to be having a ball here and it really shows in his performance and it's not easy stealing scenes from Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro but Hoffman does just that. Even Streisand is more controlled than usual and gives a nicely modulated performance as Greg's sexually uninhibited Mom. Even though it wasn't the story I was expecting, I found MEET THE FOCKERS quite entertaining, anchored by a brilliant comic turn by Dustin Hoffman as Bernie Focker.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
New Additions Make This Sequel Worthwhile,"Meet the Fockers is a sequel that lives up to the original due to the brilliant additions of Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand. The dynamic between Stiller andDe Niro made Meet the Parents work, and that chemistry is just as strong here. However, its repetitiveness does somewhat undermine the character arcs of the original.And while the first two-thirds are pretty solid, the third act takes a considerable dip, and the film falls apart slightly due to a dreadful subplot involving an apparent long-lost son of Ben Stiller.The film is uneven and indeed no classic, yet the comedic performances of film legends like De Niro, Hoffman and Streisand elevate an otherwise poor movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very Funny Sequel!!!!!!,"This is a very funny sequel. The casting is just perfect, the story and subplot interesting and funny, and the chemistry between the characters couldn't be better. I laughed almost the entire movie, and there are plenty of things I could relate to being that my parents just met my fiancée's family. Nothing as painful to watch as this, but the emotions are still the same. The beginning of the movie is wonderful and unexpected, which just set the stage for hilarious disasters later on. Even Streisand, who I was skeptical about, keeps a great sense of humor the whole film, and I am so glad she was in it! This is no high brow film, but a great comedy for couples young and old.

Hilarious but crude. Parental Guidance must.,"Plot Outline: A sequel to the hilarious Meet the Parents (2004), after male nurse Greg Focker gets permission from this would-be father-in-law and ex-CIA Jack Byrnes (De Niro), his in-laws to-be visit Greg's parents at Miami better known as Mr. and Mrs. Focker, whose wanton lifestyle in a stark contrast to the strict and suspicious Jack Byrnes. The ensuing comedy keeps you glued to your seats.Comment: The first thought that comes to one's mind is 'Damn who would have a family whose last name would be Focker?' While one ponders over this, the ensuring comedy is even crude. Some of the sequences may be unsuitable for kids. Negatives apart, the movie is a well executed comedy where you wouldn't lose track of the story. De Niro better remembered for his role as Al Capone does great as a suspicious ex-CIA man with his ease at using the hi-tech gadgets on his RV. Among the three Fockers Durstin Hoffman has done a great job! Stiller and others are just around the average. MTF is recommended for pass-time viewing for those in a mood for some crude comedy.Rating: 3/5",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A complete disappointment,"First of all, I have to say I am not a fan of art movies, in fact, I enjoy light-weight movies. With that being said, let me put it straight - Fockers is an embarrassing and stupid movie.I wasn't expecting a masterpiece or a hilarious comedy. However, I did hope to give a few laughs. The movie ended and I had not even SMILED. I was shocked by the number of old, rude and recycled jokes, none of them really funny. Just plain stupid and preposterous.While Meet the Parents was cute, naive and entertaining, this Fockers is a test for the patience. I mean, who above 10 years-old can laugh at those impossible situations ? What about that baby ? The van which looked like the Batman car ? The police officer ? The maid with the Spanish accent who was Ben's first sex relation ? Do we need more prejudice than that ? I kept expecting a gay character to come along.I wonder who is worst in this film. Ben Stiller is just AWFUL. I don't like him at all but he manages to be even worse than his average - can it be possible ? yes, it could. Talk about acting classes. His bride, Pam, is a nobody at the film. Pam's mother is wasted. I was sad to see Robert De Niro in that role. He ruins every scene with those faces and fake mannerisms.Well, now there's Barbra ... There is certainly a limit to what an actor can do for money and she crossed it without thinking twice. She and Hoffman are the only acceptable things in Fockers but they can't save the day. They do have a nice chemistry but it's impossible to deal with that lousy screenplay. I felt sorry for being a Streisand fan, I really did. We have come to expect excellence from her and what do we get ?!?! Fockers ? Her first film after so many years ? I really blushed in that scene where she has her breasts covered with cream. That's not funny, that's stupidity in its highest level. She could have used her verbal brilliance (the same one we see in What's Up, Doc?) but she never does. Anyone could have been Roz Focker, Streisand didn't bring much to the role, at least, not any of the things we have come to love her for.Anyway, the comparison between Parents and Fockers is inevitable. The first one was quite funny. Fockers is a true waste of time, good actors and money.On a scale from 1 to 5, I give it a 1 1/2 just because of Hoffman and Streisand. I considered leaving the theater several times throughout the movie, I just didn't because of Barbra and the hope that the film would improve, which never did. It is hard to believe Fockers will possibly be the highest-grossing comedy of all times in the USA.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

"A Few Precious Laughs Thanks to the 'Fockers,' Hoffman and Streisand","'Meet the Fockers' means meeting Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand. That's all you have to know, and that's the best part of the film, of which script is utterly lame, and of which set-pieces are not as funny as they should be. But the Fockers, I mean, the husband and wife played by Hoffman and Streisand are so lovable, silly, and most of all, believable that you can forget all the unnecessary part of the film, and enjoy yourself watching the vintage comic acting from the couple. Greg, no, Gaylord (Ben Stiller) and Pam (Teri Polo) come back as the lovers who are going to marry soon. This time, they have a bigger problem than before, and that is that they have to introduce the uptight father of the future bride, ex-CIA agent Jack to the parents of the Fockers. And the two Fockers house husband Bernie and sex therapist Roz (Hoffman and Streisand) are far from ordinary parents, who can casually talk about the 'first time' of their much, much beloved son at the dinner. And to Greg's dismay, they are truly enjoying the embarrassing conversations. And it is only natural that Jack find them a lot more embarrassing and even rude when ex-hippie Bernie makes fun of CLIA (L stands for 'lack of') right before the proud Jack. The ice never breaks between the two families when they pretend it does, and the awkward relations, which get more and more awkward as the story goes on, are seen in the center of the comedy. Unfortunately however, the script never gels. It has sparks sometimes, but clearly we see misfires oftener. There are several reasons for that ineffectiveness. Ben Stiller and Teri Polo do not look like a couple loving each other, and there are too many familiar kinds of gags involving toilet, dirty words, and a baby. To me, the greatest problem is that all the set-pieces are tired retread of 'Meet the Parents.' Instead of volleyball in the original, you see football. If a cat is not good enough, there is a dog. And I admit Robert DeNiro is good, and I can say he is as good as in the first one, but don't you think that he is doing too many comedies these days? But the couple of Hoffman and Streisand is a different thing, special gift from these veterans. They almost single-handedly save the film from the uninspired mess with their hilarious comic acting. The actors themselves may not be your favorite, but you should forget your liking or disliking for now, because these parents are so charming and credible. Especially Dustin Hoffman does one of his best performances in recent years. Probably the character of Bernie is so close to his own that some seem to say that the way Hoffman keeps on bubbling funny nonsense is exactly the impression we have about him during his interviews, and you can believe their words simply by watching the extraordinary but likable character he plays. Obviously Hoffman is in his element. Despite the weak script and the weaker husband-wife descriptions of Robert DeNiro and Blythe Danner, 'Meet the Fockers' is better than I expected. Of course, that does not mean very much when I usually don't expect much from the sequels. But the family of 'The Fockers' of the film's title are genuinely fun to see, and I am ready to revisit their home, even if I didn't find the film itself particularly great.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

You've met the Byrnes...,"...now Meet the Fockers! Four years after the wildly successful Meet the PArents,the whole gang is back as Nurse Greg Focker(Ben Stiller,ready for more abuse as always),his girlfriend/fiancée PAm Byrnes(Teri Polo,not asked to do much in this one but be attractive and sweet),her parents JAck and Dina Byrnes(Robert DeNiro,full-tilt psycho and Blythe Danner,cool and humane,the perfect counterbalance!)and the dog,Jinxie. To complete the cycle of getting acquainted,Pam and her folks agree to travel down to Florida to meet Greg's family(hence the title,duh!). And as conservative and prim as the Byrnes' seem to be,Bernie and Roz Focker(Dustin Hoffman,hilarious and unchained,something he doesn't seem to get a lot of opportunities to be and Barbra Streissand,kvetchy and overpowering as usual)are every bit as liberal and exuberant to measure.The story-lines that ensue from there are basically one more long descent into personal hell for Greg,who discovers horrors ranging from his parents' unrestrained pride in their son(to point of painful,as seen in their keeping of everything of Greg's,ranging from every medal or ribbon he's won to his foreskin!)to the possibility that he may've sired a child with the saucy Latin nanny he lost his virginity to many years before. As per the first movie,where the pratfalls and gags seem to get larger as the show goes on,this one has the usual ante-upping. To tell you more might give it away,so I won't. Suffice it to say,Greg Focker won't be the only one to get bruised this time.Hardly a great movie,this show demands one principal trait here: a patience with--if not outright love of--Ben Stiller. I generally like his work(though he COULD stand to say no to a script or two),so this film does me just fine. The over-reliance on saying ""Focker"" and plenty of the usual gross-out humor is going to try many audience's patience,but those who can roll with this film will do such peachy. Director Jay Roach,who obviously has no qualm with broad comedy,has the right players(including Tim Blake Nelson in a cameo)to work this kind of genre. Personally,I'd recommend it,if for nothing else some truly dumb laughs. A good compliment to the original.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
big stars doing kitsch,"I confess I do not like Barbra Streisand, except when she is singing. I never understood her diva status and I do not buy that she has big comic talent. She worked very little in the last twenty years, did only four films or so, and if she was planning some come-back 'Meet the Fockers' failed to be the opportunity.The film is based very much on ethnic stereotypes comedy. It can be funny sometimes, especially when characters and situations help - but this does not materializes here, despite of the promises. All the situation is so unreal, the conflict is schematic and predictable, that the best comic scenes of the movie - and there are a few - are gags completely unrelated to the subject, which could figure in any other comedy film.De Niro and Dustin Hoffman can do no harm, they are too good actors to be bad whatever they play, and they probably enjoyed doing this film. I personally do not like Ben Stiller, I do not find him interesting or funny, and this film did not make me change my opinion. Streisand's character is supposed to provide the counter-weight to De Niro's toughness and meld him by the end, but because of the lack of chemistry between the two all the ending seems even more artificial than it is. A lot of stars talent was spent in this film, but the result is below average Hollywood kitsch.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"The cast saves the movie from being just ""another"" comedy.","The success of the movie relies on the comedic performances of the duo formed by De Niro and Hoffman. Blythe Danner and Barbara Streissand deliver expectations though their characters don't ask for too much. Ben Stiller's comedic resources rely too much on his facial expressions and body language. Still the man is funny and gives a good performance. Teri Polo is just OK.The situations are funny but not as creative as in the previous movie. The audience expects extremely funny situations but that doesn't happens and it's not that necessary. In my opinion, the situations from the previous movie repeat in the sequel but now the situation is against De Niro. There are sub-plots that just didn't catch the viewers' attention because weren't very necessary. For example, the confusion about Greg's ""son"" didn't develop because a situation like that would ruin the movie's charm. The way the scene is explained is just too silly.""Meet the Fockers"" is an average comedy with the usual funny situations, sex jokes, and double sense humor. Not a movie that will make you laugh out loud but will surely entertain you. In my opinion, not better than ""Meet the Parents"" but it has to be watched because of it's cast.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Greg Focker is back for another round of laughter and embarrassment in this sequel to Meet the Parents.,"Starring: Ben Stiller, Robert DeNiro, Dustin Hoffman, Barbara Streisand So most of us watched Meet the Parents, right? Oddly enough, first time I saw Meet the Parents, I didn't like it that much. It just picked on poor Greg (Stiller) too much. I started to like it more with time, and now I can appreciate it a bit better.The sequel, Meet the Fockers, I found far more amusing. It picks up a few months after the first movie. Greg and Pam are set to get married pretty soon, but the parents still need to meet. Greg is a little bit apprehensive about this meeting because he knows what Pam's dad Jack (DeNiro) is like, and he knows what his parents (Hoffman and Streisand) are like. I mean, a stiff necked ex-CIA agent and a couple aging hippies? It's like watching an episode of Dharma and Greg. Wait, I'll bet that's where they got the inspiration for this movie So the Byrnes' drive out to the Focker threshold to meet the new in-laws, and it's at about this point that the movie gets really hilarious. Dustin Hoffman plays Greg's dad Bernie so well I think he's absolutely hilarious.I think the reason I probably liked this one better than the original is that it's less harsh on Greg. Sure, his parents are embarrassing, but things don't go as bad. Or at least they don't go as bad in the same way. Things do still turn out pretty bad. I mean, how would you react if your parents brought out a scrapbook from your childhood and your foreskin was in it? Yikes. I think I'd die, but I'd take my parents with me.I'm not really sure what else to say about this movie. Some of the humour is pretty crude and overtly sexual, but it's not too too bad. It could have been a lot worse.Those who liked Meet the Parents will definitely want to Meet the Fockers.Bottom Line: 3 out of 4 (worth a view)",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Has Weak Points but Is Overall Fun,"This does not even come close to being as funny as the first movie, however it still made me laugh. Hunky and Geeky Ben Stiller and Stern Overprotective Robert DeNiro are what really make the movie work. But of course the best performance of the movie came from ""Little Jack!"" What brings the movie downhill is the overdone outrageousness of Hoffman and Streisand. Sure we expect them to be much more liberal than DeNiro's family. However they are almost a little too crazy, and were actually quite irritating! Streisand is without question the most irritating person in the entire movie. There is a scene were she gives DeNiro a message and basically climbs on top of them. I'm sorry but I've never seen a message therapist like THAT before, this scene was pretty stupid, even for a comedy. Blythe Danner and a majority of the other characters are basically just their for the sake of being their. Danner was much funnier in the first movie.

Sequel Provides Decent Laughs,"After rewatching Meet the Fockers several years after its original release and my prior first time viewing, my initial thoughs about the film have changed since upon then. After the success of Meet the Parents (2000), the sequel Meet the Fockers was anticipated to be big and great. It wasn't great, yet good with several decent moments and some interesting premise. The plot was typically the same, expect both families meet each other, and they have problems with each other. Their families are complete opposites and don't interact well while being around one another. The movie started real slow, it got slightly better towards the end when the secrets got revealed but even that wasn't all that great. Some of the sexual things they thought were jokes. In particular, such as DeNiro wearing a breast pad on his chest, the same circle of trust, the dog humping, the constant use of the word ""Focker"" (especially by DeNiro), the sexual convos at their dinner the baby signals, etc. All those things which the directors assumed was funny, really wasn't. First the baby was a distraction and most of his scenes felt distasteful. Though one continuous running subplot was DeNiro making accusations that Greg had a 15 son by his affair with his old-time Latina maid. There were many great moments, however what made the film a success is the overall chemistry between the cast, specifically the tension between the Focker family, and DeNiro. Overall this movie was a disaster and the actors should be ashamed of themselves big-time. It was a complete disappointment.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Some form of comedy ensues when Greg's parents turn out liberal, while his future parents in-law are conservative.The sequel, of course, fails to be as funny as the original. In fact, i didn't get a belly laugh during the entire film. However, it was entertaining enough that i had a smile on my face throughout, i giggled pretty often, and i did laugh once or twice. Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman were the stars here and delivered the funniest moments of the film. Ben Stiller had his moments, as well. Watch for the part after he is injected with truth serum by De Niro.I think this movie would have been a lot better without Barabara Streisand. Nothing she did or said was amusing.

At least 7 out 10,"The reason I went for 7 out of 10 as opposed to less is because this film is carried by the actors and characters we love. I didn't give the film anymore because throughout the movie there's not much to shout about. It's not quite dull, but it falls flat compared with the original which obviously got more ratings. I think they left the sequel too late when they've all aged a bit and also apart from a few flashy gadgets from Q branch, Jack Burns doesn't have quite the same impact.I'd have suggested more tension between Jack and Greg. Instead it felt like just a retired fairly odd old man showing stubbornness by offloading his thoughts by talking to a baby and so there was not enough seriousness or conviction and the conflict wasn't good enough. Then the added silliness of Greg's parents taking most of the realism away. With this lack of suspicious tension and conflict that made the first film so great, this movie fell short.I will add I didn't like Pam's character she doesn't have much to say. Dana played her part well yet Dustin Hoffman's performance although convincing wasn't quite natural enough for the film thereby taking away much of the realism. Not forgetting the audience can relate to this situation between Jack and Greg and so it was important to keep things as real and relevant as possible without overusing too much of silliness from Greg's family.The third movie was way sillier thus backs up my point by failing. Nevertheless, I just love watching this family. Undoubtedly Robert Di Nero is amazing and Ben Stiller is very well suited to this character.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Mild OK comedy,"I should point that I never saw the original ""Meet the Parents"" so I went into this with no preconceived ideas.

They all go to meet Gaylord's parents--Bernie (Dustin Hoffman) and Razalin (Barbra Streisand). His parents are liberal and free-wheeling--hers aren't. Sparks fly.The only reason I saw this was for the cast. We have some wonderful actors here--De Niro, Hoffman, Danner and Streisand. They all can do comedy and make the movie pleasant. All in all it's very OK. It moves quick, the comedy isn't too crude (hence the PG-13 rating) and Stiller and Polo make a nice pleasant couple. My only problems are Stiller's character going through some needlessly violent slapstick, De Niro's character is WAY too unpleasant (especially at the end) and the beautiful Danner is criminally underused.

Disappointingly poor,"This movie was a real letdown. Completely inappropriate for family, kids -- anyone. Weak writing, depending on lewd jokes, cheap jokes. A horrible movie. That is my main complaint -- just bad writing, cheap tricks, dumb plot. A high school screen writing class could do better in one afternoon. No joke.With a cast like that, it could have been so much more, so funny, but in every way this was a letdown.There was not even one laugh-out-loud thing, and only a few that even brought out a snicker.

Basically the first movie warmed over,"I wasn't a big fan of ""Meet the Parents,"" because it's basically Ben Stiller going through one agonizing situation after another, then at the end everyone understands everyone, blah blah.You're pretty much getting the same thing with ""Meet the Fockers."" All the performances were entertaining, and everyone played their roles very well. Streisand and Hoffman were given large characters to play, but didn't chew up the scenery, and that's better than I'd expected.Still, you've seen this movie before, but there are plenty of laughs if you enjoyed the first one, and I would recommend it for those people.The only other real negative I would toss in is that the use of Yiddish/Hebrew was superfluous. Rather than it just popping up as the result of normal situations, it was painfully overused in the context it was presented in.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Ridiculous, mean-spirited comedy wastes good cast","Witless follow-up to ""Meet the Parents"" is full of slapstick chaos with poor continuity, strained gags, pets used as vulgar visual jesters, and a screaming toddler. Worse than that, the film has some of the worst writing, directing, and cinematography I've seen all year. Ben Stiller, his lipsticked-mouth always open in surprise and his eyes rimmed in black like a raccoon, makes certain his overly-pancaked face is in close-up at all available times; this must have been contagious, because the cameraman plasters the screen with everybody's mug, which wouldn't be so bad except that their confusion over the stupidity of the plot is magnified. Jokes are flayed around desperately in the hopes of hitting a target (even the end-credits joke-reel fails). Loud instead of funny, everything is underlined and then milked for a chuckle. There are terrible sequences and running jokes in this movie, jokes that are even out of character (like Robert De Niro and the strap-on breast). It doesn't work. As for that bawling infant, who also gets his fair share of close-ups: he learns to talk dirty, which really cracked up the audience I saw ""Meet the Fockers"" with. *1/2 from ****",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
similar to the first. average sequel,"Ben Stiller (Zoolander) stars as Greg Gaylord Focker, an uncomfortable man who takes his fiancé's family to meet his parents, who prove to be quite different people than Jack Byrnes (De Niro) would ever imagine. The sequel to the popular 2000 hit comedy Meet the Parents is intriguing, if slightly bizarre and predictable, with a strong cast leading the way.Very similar to Meet the Parents, this sequel uses physical humour, embarrassing situations and a variety of characters to justify the comedy genre and does so well enough with a few good moments involving Ben Stiller. However it does feel very comparable to the last film and like so many other comedies, it is a tried and tested format but works well enough.Like the first film, its all about meeting people who are very different and the contrasts work well, with Hoffman's (Rain Man) and Streisand's very unique way of living compared to Byrne's professional and organised way of life, its interesting to observe different lifestyles.The plot is fairly consistent with up and down moments but coming towards the end it really goes off track and exaggerates a bit.The acting is good enough, though with the list of A-listers here you would no doubt expect better.The direction isn't the best though the settings are good, and the use bus is interesting to see and a unique device.Overall its an average comedy with a few good jokes. The acting and direction isn't the best but it's the writing that lets the film down the most with not enough intensity and interest to really get the characters going.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Barbra Streisand, as the groom's sex therapist mother, goes over the top to be embarrassingly touchy-feely at all times, and she is funny, and as her husband, Dustin Hoffman is an able sidekick, if eclipsed by La Streisand.Robert De Niro is great as the uptight paranoid father in law. As his wife, Blythe Danner is sweet but under-written. Ben Stiller as the groom is the usual put-upon schmuck while Teri Polo as his young bride is again under-written and more a straight role.

"Genuinely Entertaining Movie, one small defect...","Meet The Fockers is a hilarious sequel to the highly successful movie, Meet The Parents.

Jack Byrnes appears to have rejoined the CIA as he always has, delving into Greg's past to uncover anything he can to destroy him.One minor defect in the film is how Owen 'Ben Stiller's in this film so I have to be as well' Wilson is so poorly written into the script.

As funny as cancer,"I never thought I'd see the day when the words 'Robert De Niro' would guarantee one thing only - you are about to watch a bad movie. To be fair though, the blame is not really his. Meet the Parents had the occasional funny part, and they were all in the trailer.Humour is completely absent from this. I wasn't expecting much, and was still gravely disappointed. Everyone in the cast deserves better material. The sight of De Niro in a strap-on breast feeding device is a truly sad sight and an indication of how low his career has sunk. The only unfunnier things on display here are Hoffman and Streisand.

Meet The Fockers...Again,"""Meet The Fockers"" had it's funny moments, but because it is a sequel, it has to stand up to its predecessor. ""Meet The parents"" was a funny film where the jokes all seemed to flow and you felt for Ben Stiller's character because he was trying his best not to screw up. In ""Meet The Fockers"" we get some of the same jokes recycled. Some of the reality is taken out of the picture when Jack(Deniro) uses some of his C.I.A. tricks. We also wonder why Ben Stiller is still trying to impress Jack when at the end of the first film, he was holding his hand through the wedding.Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand were terrific as the Fockers. They were the exact opposite of Pam's parents yet they were believable parents not too out of the extraordinary. Both supplied very funny moments.The last film prospered from very funny supporting characters which this film seemed to lack. The baby jokes were mostly forced and there was not enough Jinxy Cat.This is not to say that ""Meet The Fockers"" was a bad film. I found that there were some very funny moments. I also found that there were some very dull moments as well.Meet The Fockers= **1/2 out of **** Meet The Parents=***1/2 out of ****",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A waste of time,"It's incredible how awful this movie is. Very sad to see De Niro, Hoffman and even Streisand in this fiasco. Another example of US filming decadence. Stupid history, forced situations and poor performances. The best thing about the movie is the little boy acting with signs. The situation about the families is totally ridiculous and at the end everything is solved as usual, the happy ending and everyone are in peace with each other. Predictable situations are present all the time, since the fake breast, Stiller's speech under drugs, pregnancy, etc. Another movie with the same structure: a preface, a simple comedy/drama and a happy ending. No more to think, everything is solved. Another stupid movie to forget very quickly (I hope). No more to say about it. Awful",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

De Niro's character is very conservative, so let's make these guys ultra-liberal, it's kinda easy. Still, the movie has a sort of inherent sweetness, which mainly becomes apparent near the ending.

High Quality Vintage Comedy,"You won't walk out of the theater any smarter than when you walked in, but you'll have fun.In this sequel to MEET THE PARENTS, the WASP parents of Gaylord ""Greg"" Focker's fiancée visit Focker's Jewish folks. And the ""fish out of water"" humor begins as the fiancée's intensely anal former CIA father comes face to face with an entirely different way of life. While all ends in a predictably happy ending, it's the bumps along the rocky road to matrimony that make this film an entertaining show.By the way, I had no idea Barbra Streisand was in such great shape, and when was the last time you saw her in a lousy movie? Exactly. This is a well honed and well executed funny sequel. And it's way better than Christmas WITH THE KRANKS.However, the potty jokes get a little old, and they keep popping up throughout the entire film. So if you hate that kind of humor, it's not going away in the first ten.Of all the attributes of this comedy, I'd say the best part was seeing all the terrific actors seem so real.

Very Funny Film,"""Meet The Fockers"" is a very funny film. The zenith of it's success is the performance given by Dustin Hoffman. He plays a middle aged Jewish lawyer who seems to have never practiced his trade. He is financially dependent on his wife, played by Barbara Streisand. She is a working sex therapist for the elderly, and the concept alone is a humorous one. She gives a fairly good performance in a role that is funny in it's own right. Ben Stiller plays their son who is introducing his in-laws to the folks in their humble abode in Florida. Robert DiNero is the retired CIA agent and father of the bride. He tries to maintain his inner circle of secrecy with his own family, but eventually bends under the psychological assault by the Fockers. The title is funny. Hoffman is funny, and the experience is worth the effort just for his performance alone. It is light, and can be a pleasing cinema experience.

Now for our new actors and their interpretation I have to tell you that Dustin Hoffman who plays as Bernie Focker the father of Greg Focker and Barbra Streisand who plays as Rozalin Focker the mother of Greg Focker were really impressive.Lastly I have to admit that I did not expect from this movie to be as good as the first one but it did and this is something important.

Meh...,"In 2004, half of the 10 highest-grossing movies were sequels to previous box-office winners released less than 2 or 3 years before: ""Shrek 2"", ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"", ""Spider-Man 2"", ""Ocean Twelve"" and naturally, ""Meet the Fockers"". It's also worth noticing that four of these five sequels were second installments. Obviously, you don't change a winning recipe is a motto followed by many producers, and who can blame them in an industry driven by money and profit?But I'm not trying to be cynical, not yet. The reason I raise these statistics is because they prove indeed that the sequel of a good movie will always attract viewers, as if it was covering half-of the marketing budget just by being a sequel. The trick is to follow a pattern that succeeded and inject enough newness to surprise the viewers. The point is to never get too distant from the original material and still be new. Well, that can work with plot-driven movies and linear narrative; however, it's more difficult to be original when a film is the continuation of a situation-driven comedy, like ""Meet the Parents"".The original film was about being an outsider, about a clash resulting from a triangular love : Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) loved his girlfriend, Pam (Teri Polo), Jack Byrnes (Robert De Niro) loved his daughter, so both guys had to get along despite their different mentalities. Naturally, at the end, they both started to appreciate each other, the peace pipe was smoked and all went well that ended well, so there had to be another plot device for the comic-of-opposition, so after an exhaustive brainstorm they thought: how about discovering Greg's family? And the casting of Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand as the Fockers' couple retired in Hawaii, could only be encouraging.The effect would be doubled, first we have to replay the games with equal rules, it's time for good old Jack Byrnes to learn about the Fockers' customs and philosophy of life, and put in perspective his 'personal' methods. How someone who believes his daughter never had sex before marriage would deal with a sex-therapist? How would a constipated, overly-protective man deal with spontaneous persons who believe in letting nature speaks, and people to follow their instincts? Secondly, it would be exciting to discover what kind of parents could raise a boy like Gaylord Focker.The problem is that the two premises cancel each other, the Fockers' irritate Byrnes because they're free-spirited, open-minded, everything he's not, but that's the way they are, and they never try to be something else, it's mildly funny but it's nothing compared to Greg's attempt to please Jack that turns out to be disasters. The second problem is that the parents are so optimistic, so jovial and upbeat, she believes in sex as the greatest medium of expression, he's a lawyer who believes that winning is not the most essential thing, how could they end up conceiving a guy like Greg.Maybe it was the only way to turn Greg into the victim of both his parents and in-laws, following an unnecessary subplot where Jack suspects Greg to have a child with his former nurse (Alana Urbach), it doesn't quite work, not better than the drugs allegations in the former one. At the end, what is left to enjoy in ""Meet the Fockers"" is very communicative performance from Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand and probably, one of the greatest child-acting performances ever, through the cute Little Jack who'd learn one word from Gaylord Focker.Unsurprisingly, at the end, they marry, they celebrate the wedding, everyone's happy, but nothing is much left to enjoy, it's fun, but nothing else. There was a true potential to let the differences between the Byrnes and the Fockers to escalate until the kind of confrontation where even the Fockers would acknowledge some flaws in their education, something that would justify why Greg is so ashamed of them. There could have been a much more hilarious climax (literally) during the massage scene, but instead of having an orgasm, Jack hurts his back again and gets upset.So many wasted opportunities, but well, except for Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand, the film doesn't provide much more originality, except for the funniest part of the film, the opening where everything goes perfectly fine for Greg, from the taxis to the airports, that was a clever way to put some distance from the original one, a pity that the rest didn't match it. But I guess the first opus' success asked for a sequel, even with declining quality.Did I mention ""Little Jack""? Yeah? So I guess it's time to conclude this review..",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Outside of the circle and off the chain.,"After the huge success of Meet the Parents in 2000, it was inevitable that a sequel would follow. In fact as a write this a sequel to this sequel is due for release later in the summer! With that, it's no surprise where the writers would go with this particular movie. What kind of parents would call their son Gaylord? And are they likely to be on the same wavelength as Robert DeNiro's priggish ex CIA operative Jack Byrnes? Course not. Cue poles apart comedy as Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand play Gaylord Focker's {Ben Stiller} ""new age"" parents and drive the Byrnes' to distraction. Even the pets are cut from a different mental cloth, while the addition of Little Jack 'L.J.' Byrnes into the mix only adds more comedy fuel for the fire.It's not rocket science writing, it is in fact a very basic comedy formula. That of thrusting different characters, from very different backgrounds, together under one roof for one very long weekend. Can intended newlyweds Gaylord & Pam (Teri Polo) survive their parents and suspicious skeletons in the closet? Well there's no prizes for guessing correctly how it's going to pan out. But thanks to the cast attacking the material with such gusto, and with skillful comic timing, it all folds together neatly for a fun packed and enjoyable 115 minute movie. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Isn't this just a ""Carry On"" movie with A-list talent? No, thankfully.","""Meet the Parents"" was probably the best of Robert DeNiro's numerous forays into the lighter side, though it's a long way away from the terrific ""Tribeca"" TV series he executive produced. ""Meet the Fockers"" is even further away - this is, in some senses, a crude comedy that wouldn't get much notice or be taken too seriously if its stars were all under the age of 30, but since none of them are, and since three of the four stars have Oscars to their name, it's a horse of a different colour. But like the slight but engaging original, this has more going for it than jokes about a male nurse called Gaylord Focker.The movie's pitting a relatively straightlaced couple (DeNiro and Gwynnie's mum) against a much more free-living pair (lawyer Dustin Hoffman and sex therapist Barbra Streisand) isn't the most original premise, and writers Jim Herzfeld and John Hamburg and director Jay Roach occasionally... okay, not that occasionally... go for the cheap gag (""Honk if you're horny"" indeed - and is that Erica Campbell as the driver of the bus, or just wishful thinking on my part?) - but the cast's enthusiastic playing is very hard to resist, with Hoffman a standout as the kind of dad who's so embarrassing most of us will relate in a second. Somehow if he, DeNiro and Barbra Streisand had been in the same movie in the 1970s it's hard to imagine it would be like this (especially since Streisand, never renowned for the smallness of her ego, is billed fourth!).Where the movie really scores isn't in jokes about the Fockers's dog humping the Byrnes's cat (!!!), but in the way it leavens the comedy with the subtext about trust, which is ultimately what the movie is really about. This may well strike some viewers as unnecessary schmaltz, but without it the movie wouldn't have anything at its heart. While the added dimension has its drawbacks (it does seem a bit too long), in the end ""Meet the Fockers"" is more than a gross-out comedy for grownups; everyone looks as if they're having a good time, and ultimately so will many viewers, even if it does repeat some elements of the first one (but then, most sequels do). Ultimately, I liked it.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good acting covered up by poor writing and terrible directing.,"For those of you that have not yet had time to go out and rent ""Meet the Fockers"", don't sweat it and just wait until it's on TBS. If you're a fan of the original, you'll be severely disappointed and if you haven't you'll either be sick or confused with some occasional chuckles. ""Meet the Fockers"" probably looked good on paper and probably had a high demand since the original was so successful, but it failed to meet expectations and forgot what made the first one such a comedic hit.""Fockers"" stars the original cast with the addition of Dustin Hoffman (Bernie Focker) and Barbara Streisand (Roz Focker), as the Byrnes family takes a trip down to Miami to meet Greg's parents and plan the up coming Focker-Byrne wedding. That's really as deep as the plot goes, with the additions of few side elements that take place during the vacation.The first was practically a classic as it featured Ben Stiller in his usual ""everything goes wrong with me"" role that makes the audience stress out beyond belief which is supposed to induce laughter. It did work though, as Stiller's position of meeting a potential spouse's parents can be nerve-wracking is somewhat believable. In the sequel, the main comedy was focused on the Byrnes family meeting the Focker family, trying to hit it off and with Greg caught in the middle still trying to impress Jack with his usual antics and trying to change his parents.The main reason this movie was near unbearable was the the intelligence insulting writing, especially the gag bits, that still revolved on Jack's borderline OCD and over protectiveness of his daughter, constant sexual innuendos, the drenching use of the word ""Focker"", and the just plain fact the whole situation was totally implausible. To start with, the sexual innuendos (and I use this term loosely) was way out of control, which this tactic was practically non-existent in the first one. I have no problem with sexually laced jokes and gags mind you, but the jokes in this movie were too forward, not funny, over used and didn't fit: Jack's fake boob to feed his grandson (don't ask), Bernie's missing testicle story, the awkwardness between the conveniently placed babysitter with breasts big enough to make Pam Anderson blush who Greg lost his virginity with, Greg's infant foreskin than landed in the fondue pot during dinner, and Roz's and Bernie's open sexuality that is present throughout the whole movie. Was there really a need to write in a scene where Greg has to stop his parents from having sex with Streisand covered with Cool-Whip from the waist up like strawberry shortcake, due to the fact his future in-laws where sleeping right below, on the first night? All this movie needed was an apple pie and Stifler and it would been complete.Also, as may read in several other reviews, was the constant use of the word ""Focker"" which was practically run into the ground in the first one was in full affect this sequel. Not only is it in the title, but it it's also used like every 5 minutes. Yes, we all get it, it kind of sounds like a similar four letter word that may be considered vulgar. So, if we get it, why doesn't entire cast get it? This is where my entire beef with implausibility comes in. Both in-laws doing various gags through out the movie was down right idiotic and insulting, as all four the parents seem like sophisticated people; including one being a lawyer and one being ex-CIA. Would a house host really go to the bathroom (....#2) while their guest is taking a shower? Would a potential father-in-law jam a syringe filled with sodium pentathol (truth serum)into his daughter's finance during their engagement party just to solidify his ""circle of trust?"" During the entire movie I was chomping a the bit waiting for one of these parents to grow up, which was unfortunately in the final scenes.On a lighter note, the acting was quite good with DeNiro of course but the roles played by Hoffman and Streisand were quite impressive. Unfortunately the teen-movie writing and bad directing overcame any evident of acting. This film may have been a little bit easier to swallow, if the the original didn't exist which set the bar and the tone of the comedic level. Unfortunately it's another sequel that misses the mark and depends on the addition of other ""A"" list actors in the cast and the success of the original to draw in audiences.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Distract them with star power!!,"'Meet The Fockers' is an interesting attempt at a sequel to the very funny ""Meet The Parents"". Most of the principal cast is back, Ben Stiller, Robert DeNiro et al.

So essentially, it's ALMOST the same movie, except De Niro seems to be the odd man out this time.

Overall I'm not the biggest fan of this film series, this series of movies annoys me, and is lazy in my opinion, but of all three films, Meet the Fockers is my personal favorite, I do think that it was the one out of all three, that was the most well-made.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good to watch once,"I went into this movie with pretty low expectations. I'd read reviews in the press that suggested it wasn't up to much, and so when I really enjoyed Meet the Fockers I was nicely surprised.The premise of the movie is a simple one. Greg and Dina have decided to marry, and having finally won over the formidable Jack Byrnes in the original movie, the time has come to introduce the parents to each other.Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Striesand are well cast in the roles of Gaylord's (Greg) embarrassing hippie parents, who are as you would expect, a world away from stuffy and conservative Jack.Where this film perhaps falls down a little compared to the original is in the setting. In Meet the Parents anyone can identify with the situation Greg enters. Presented with an uncompromising father and close-knit family harbouring a shared secret he falls foul of his constant attempts to impress and terrible luck.In Meet the Fockers the film hangs more on the diametrically opposed Bernie (Hoffman) and Jack (De Niro). While this works, it perhaps a little harder for many people to immediately identify with.That said the film contains many genuinely funny moments and set-pieces, and unlike the first film, none of the humour feels over-exposed.My one disappointment in Meet the Fockers came from Jack. Fantastic in the first film, his character somehow seemed to have lost much of his punch, becoming more difficult and awkward than intimidating.I really enjoyed Meet the Fockers, and while it's not as engrossing as the original, it is funny and certainly worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Funny,"""Meet the fockers"" was awesomely funny, and did have a happily ever after kind of ending which is common in comedy movies. But, where else can you see a tiny dog humps a cat twice the size of him? A spiritual sex therapist mom that talks about sexual related topics 24/7? ""Meet the fockers"" has got all the package! I loved how ironic it turned out to be when Gaylord decided not to buy that rental car insurance, thinking he was smart at identifying scams, but what happened to the rental car?? He smashed the car window with a piece of brick by accident(oh, he smashed it good too). He successfully delivered a baby himself even though he was only a nurse. He thought that his life had just shifted itself onto the right track, and everything was going just about right, until he got to meet his fiancé's family. ""Meet the fockers"" is definitely a good comedy movie to watch in theaters, and perhaps you could add it to your own DVD collections as well. It was great!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
It was a comedy?,"When I first saw Meet the Parents, I was laughing more than I thought humanly possible. The sheer number of comedy moments added to the laughter. So, naturally, I went to the film with high hopes. Boy, was I disappointed.The opening scenes of the film failed to raise one smile. The characters are never properly introduced. And, worst of all, the story is given no direction. If you've not seen the first film, you will have no idea what is going on here.The film continues down and illogical path with scenes chopping all over the place. Where for example did the baby come from? Sure, it is explained but why in hell is it needed? Comedy value? I think not.Then, once ""the Focker household"" is reached, the ""story"" as much as it is, reaches a standstill. One of the most prolific actors and one of the most famous singers of all time both put on poor performances and fail to provide one laugh in all the film.The ""jokes"" all seem tired and laboured, the situations are all dragged on too long and seeming comedy opportunities are missed completely.At the end of the film, it seems to actually get worse... that is until the two best characters in the film appear for 5 minute sections each. A highway cop with a comedy accent and a character from the first film who is obviously due for an appearance. Ben Stiller fans can probably guess.All in all, this is a very poor show. Drivel you could say. This is, in all honesty, one of the worst films I have seen in the last few years. Not quite reaching the terrible lows of Christmas with The Kranks....but dangerously close. If Ben Stiller is going to star in so many films, he needs to make sure they aren't a pile of Hollywood-processed tat before auditioning.I cannot really recommend this to anyone. If you enjoy mediocre, American comedy, then go right ahead. If not, steer well clear and see something worthwhile instead.4/10.Gains an extra two points for the two genuinely funny characters at the end.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Nutshell Review: Meet The Fockers,"If this is a comedy year, then it's gotta be Ben Stiller's year, with films like Starsky and Hutch, Dodgeball, and now, a sequel to the hit Meet The Parents. It's a logical move, given the success to the movie, and a natural continuation to meeting the other set of parents, what more one whose family name sounds so much like an expletive.The film wastes no time in reminding you why the first was successful, with obvious jabs on the male nursing profession and his Gaylord M Focker name. The first 5 minutes sums up everything you liked about the first film nicely - ""I'm Watching You"" hand gestures, circle of trust, etc, before embarking on the inane journey to Focker Isle, where things get, a little crazier.Our favourite characters like the kitty cat are back, and joined with another madcap hump-everything-that-moves doggie. In addition, we have a baby on board who adds a new dimension to innocence.Although some plot bits are recycled from the first, like the use of hidden cameras by De Niro, and then playbacked for hilarious effect during the end credits, none of it seems contrived and you just wanna sit through and lap all of it up.Definite must see this holiday season.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
rentable yarn,"Fun and humorous. I laughed a great deal. The first while was a bit bland, but the comedy really emerged in the latter half, especially with the addition of Hoffman and streisand (sporting quite the plastic surgery, talk about smooth, doll-like, plasticity skin... wow).This kind of comedy is situational. It takes situations and explores the comic possibilities inherent in it. It pushes situations to the limit. In that sense, it takes you on a roller-coaster ride that is highly entertaining, albeit imperfect. owen Wilson's cameo was unforgettable as the inter-faith preacher. Hoffman was a little over the top, but it worked. Some of the ""sincere, touching"" moments didn't seem to fit in this movie, and streisand was annoying, with her plasticity face bouncing around and her new agey attitude (ample cleavage shots served as a not so unpleasant distraction, but you have to wonder about the naturalness of those assets). Some really classic moments, like the statues with giant members and the books about having a happy vagina.But overall it has a sort of ""been there, seen that"" feel, but not enough to detract from the enjoyment of it. It just has loads in common with other movies of the same ilk, from Meatballs to Naked Gun. People caught in awkward situations, with a healthy dose of potty humour thrown in for good measure.I was amused. It's nice to see DeNiro in fine form. Ben Stiller was hilarious and the bit about his ""fifteen year old son"" who acts exactly like him and looks damn similar really cracked me up as well. Blythe Danner is just gorgeous and classy.This is one of those movies with lots of physical comedy and classic moments that stick with you, much like the type of humour from the old screwball comedies from days of yore such as Bringing Up Baby. It's well done and a nice, ripping yarn. Like I stated, it's not perfect and far from classic, but it's a satisfying sequel to the original, which, in all honesty, is more consistently funny. You may want to rent it, though, as opposed to running out to the nearest cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Waste of Their Talent and My Time and Money,"The first movie was fun. This one had only one big laugh, the scene with the cat and dog and the toilet, and a few chuckles. The photography was awful. It looked like it was made in somebody's back yard (possibly we just saw a poor quality print).I'll admit that people were laughing and I seemed to be the only one in our group who wasn't, but it just didn't strike me as funny. There was nothing original here. Barbra and Dustin had a good time working together and clearly knew they were better than the material, but they couldn't save this movie.And shame on Tim Blake Nelson for making crap like this. Is he that desperate for money? I hope not. At least his part was tiny: I doubt that he spent a whole day doing it.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
When opposite personalities collide,"The second Focker film takes the growing relationships further by introducing Greg's parents to the Byrnes' mother and father. Things don't go off without a hitch or ten as both parties take a different approach to lifestyles and parenting: one free-spirited, the other planned.The name ""Greg Focker"" should be synonymous with disaster. Everywhere he goes and every situation he finds himself in causes more accidents to take place than student drivers on road tests. You can expect almost everything to go wrong and trying to figure out where it's coming from involves some obvious setups but also a number of curve balls to throw the viewer off. This is also filled with one-off zingers that you might not expect, though they pass through with cartoonish shock instead of a rewarding layered buildup.Jack Byrnes is a three-step ahead guy at his core, down to the blueprints of his armored RV to get to the tropical Focker residence with Greg's parents awaiting with open arms and liberal views. Barbra Streisand, playing Rozalin Focker, injects the first strong female personality that doesn't act like a wallflower with her open advice as a sexual therapist. Greg soon becomes a referee to separate the tension and anxiety with both parties attempting to either humble themselves to accommodate or change the other person to their own way. One can relate to him as embarrassing moments are brought up, such as a wall of ""accomplishments,"" a detailed scrap book and even revealing his first time. New characters are introduced, including the little grandson of Greg's girlfriend's sister who's training for brilliance, as well as the seductive nanny with spiced up accent and a questionable son.The characters often play their roles deadpan with chaos going on around them. This takes serious subjects about relationships and puts an over-the-top spin on them. Compared to ""Meet the Parents,"" it's much more outlandish, though with more scenarios that ring with Saturday morning cartoon flavor than what could really happen. This slips in some messages without getting too serious or sentimental that deal with compromising your differences to get along with others and splitting away from the life your parents preplanned for you. The second film was somewhat entertaining and came with some memorable scenes, though it doesn't hold the freshness and power of the first film even with some of the same jokes retreaded.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
These Fockers Are Still Funny,"Right now at the multiplex...if you want a dynamic biopic of an obsessive compulsive pilot, see 'The Aviator'. If you need a stunning reminder of the worst of human nature, see 'Hotel Rwanda'. Or if you want a boxing movie that's got much more going for it than just pugilism, see 'Million Dollar Baby'. Other studios have their best Oscar foot forward with those films, but Dreamworks is making the most money with their critic-proof comedy sequel, 'Meet The Fockers'. And I'm a bit surprised to say this---it's pretty funny.DeNiro and Stiller are joined by Hoffman and Streisand in this go-round. Dusty and Babs play Stiller's hippie parents, which is too much for uptight CIA whiz DeNiro to handle. Director Jay Roach has 4 huge stars to deal with, but he juggles them all quite well. Hoffman is the treat here and he's a wonderfully zany addition. Streisand is okay too. Other cast members do basically what they did in 'Meet The Parents', which is to look good and play off the headliners. There's a baby in the picture now too---DeNiro's cute grandson. The big fight that nearly breaks up the family circle (similar plot development as in the first film) kills some of the smiles for a while, but things get back on track before it's over.So bring some chums because this is a crowd picture. It's bound to be funnier if you're with a bunch of people. And it's amazing how many chuckles they can get from the cast saying, ""Focker"". So will there be a 'Meet The Children' or some kind of 3rd installment? Since this franchise and 'Shrek' are Dreamworks' cash cows, Stiller and Teri Polo better have some kids in a hurry. The taxi driver and the graduate as dueling grandfathers would be even more comic gold.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

But of course : if you see the life the way Jack Byrnes sees his own life, don't go, you waste your money...

"Good, But Lacking Magic of the First Focker Flick","First off, loved Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand as the Focker parents. They played their eccentricities to a ""T"". Very nicely done. However, where the new arrivals shined, the underlying theme was the feeling that you'd ""been there, seen that"" as you watch this movie.In ""Meet The Parents,"" the magic was the unease of Ben Stiller in trying to fit in with Deniro and Co. It seemed more genuine than this sequel. I honestly felt this movie was somewhat forced, with the acting half-robotic, or going through the motions.And Teri Polo looks TOTALLY different in this one...not sure what happened, there. Thought she looked much better in the first. I thought her role could have been a lot more...it seemed like she was almost a minor character in this film.Either way, this is a good one to sit through if you'd like a few laughs.

With huge box office results, it's on the list of the ""Highest Grossing Films of 2004."" I'll say that I laughed a lot during this film. It had it's moments. But the thing is that the first movie, Meet The Parents is an original movie. It didn't have to be very funny to be such a good movie. The first wasn't even that funny, but I still enjoyed it. It's like, when they made the sequel, they thought it needs to be more funny than the first. Meet The Fockers is a funny movie but it just isn't like the first. It tried so hard to be hilarious, which it was.There was a problem I had with this movie. The rating. This is supposed to be a PG-13 movie, but it's so close for an R rating. Of course I'm allowed to see this movie, but what about the younger viewers. The film has brief nudity and some strong sexual humor. Thats why they tried to make it so funny, by adding so many sex related jokes. The original didn't have to do that and it became one of my favorite movies.

Meet the Good Movie!!,"This movie was OK, I mean, it wasn't THAT good. It has the amazing Barbara Streisand, who is not nearly as talented Joaquin Phoenix. Then again, Joaquin Phoenix was not in this movie. The good thing about this movie was the way Bobby DeNiro behaved toward the AMAZING Dusty Hoffman. Yes, their chemistry was great. I got a little annoyed at the constant was Dusty was obsessing with sex non stop with the democrat Streisand, but deferment, it was part of the movie. Ben Stiller delivered the goods as he always does. That kid who was his ""kind of kid"" was a dead ringer for Ben ""the great actor"" Stiller. I laughed so hard that I thought I was going to lose my temper! Yes, this movie was good. Not as good as the FIRST one, but still it was good. Joaquin Phoenix was not even CONSIDERED to do this role. Apparently Joaquin Phoenix is not much of a comedy actor.

Jerry and Anne should be proud that their box office winner son Ben has pulled off another winner with same style that he's been polishing since There's Something About Mary. Ben Stiller can do more with a look and a stutter than most actors can do with a page of dialog. As for everyone's favorite Ratso Rizzo, it's worth it just to see a guy who's old enough to collect social security playing football and dancing up a storm. Dustin Hoffman is the perfect father to Ben's character. Blythe Danner plays the ""Edith Bunker"" type wife to Di Niro's CIA Agent character to a T. Teri Polo puts in another great job.

On par with the first even with a few misses,"Meet the Fockers is the sequel to the hit Meet the Parents (2000). In this film Gaylord (Greg) Focker, played by Ben Stiller, and Pam Byrnes, played by Terri Polo, worry about the first meeting of their parents before their planned marriage.Of course stuff hits the fan as uptight Jack Byrnes, played by Robert De Niro, meets Bernie Focker, played by Dustin Hoffman, and Roz Focker, played by Barbara Streisand.The Fockers are elder hippy types (free love and self esteem) who utterly love their Greg. Jack hates it. He is about being a winner on a winning team.Greg isn't happy either. His parents are themselves and they embarrass him constantly.This is a funny movie with more laughs than the first. Of course they mine the gutter for some laughs but the more mature humor is excellent.I went to see the movie because of Stiller. I find him funny as the nervous uptight guy who tries so hard to do the right thing then sees it blow up in his face. He is a lovable loser. However in Meet the Fockers, Greg seems normal and on occasion seems to fade in the background when Hoffman and Streisand are on the screen. I was a bit disappointed with Greg this go around.Robert De Niro did another good job as Jack. I was expecting him to do his mafia stuff at several points. That would have been extra funny.I was surprised with Hoffman and Streisand. Dustin is plain loopy through most of the film and he is a hoot to watch. Some other actors have said that is how he is off screen. I would love to hang out with him.Barbara Streisand just shines in her role as Roz. It reminded me of the comedies she did in the 70's like ""For Pete's Sake"" and ""Main Event"".While the movie was funny and fun to watch there were some issues I had with it.I did like the moment where Jack calls Greg out on a lie he told in the first movie. For those of us who saw the first one, that was a good laugh. Where the aside to the first film missed the mark was when Greg and Pam run into the flight attendant that had Greg arrested in the first movie. Greg sort of acted like he knew her but the writers missed a great chance at a joke there. It have been that Stiller underplayed the meeting.The character of Jack Jr. - Jack's toddler grandson just wasn't needed. There was a bit where Greg is watching the tike and the trouble that comes from that but overall they should have not had the baby.The subplot with Greg's childhood Nanny was a bit on the tasteless side and didn't help the film. The speech that Greg makes at the party was painful to watch - the humor was much too dark on that one.Except for those issues I kind of hope they do a 3rd film.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Very funny,"Meet The Fockers is that rarity, a sequel that surpasses the original in quality and laughs. Meet The Parents was not a very funny movie because I thought the joke of Ben Stiller being constantly humiliated in front of Robert De Niro got really old really quickly. There is still some of that in this movie, but here Stiller has help to stand up to De Niro's uptight character. That help comes in the form of Barbara Streisand and Dustin Hoffmann as Stiller's parents. These two appear to be having the time of their lives in this movie. The energy they display gives the movie the boost it needs to be more than a rerun of the first movie. My only gripe is that the film is needlessly long and has an unnecessary subplot involving Stiller's more housekeeper. Other than that, this movie is much more fun than its predecessor and I would rather watch this movie than Meet The Parents. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A knockabout comedy for effortless Sunday afternoon viewing,"What might have been a less than engaging follow-up to the fairly shallow if entertaining Meet the Parents, turns out to be reasonable fare, in large part due to the wholehearted performances by Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro and Barbra Streisand. Ben Stiller trundles along as the rather dumb son in law to be, having put off his wedding for fear of introducing the two fearsomely mismatched sets of parents.Robert De Niro is on quite reasonable form as the ex-CIA man who wants everything perfectly under control, ordered and predictable, including a son in law. As a failed lawyer and enthusiastic middle-aged hippie, Hoffman is married to Streisand who is a sex-therapist for seniors. Whilst the run ins of the two sets of parents are entirely predictable, they are carried off with such enthusiastic charm that it is hard not to get into the spirit of it and enjoy a few laughs.

Not funny at all.,"Unfortunately meet the Fockers can't reach the level of meet the parents. The main reason is the role of Dustin Hoffman (Galylord's father). I know Dustin Hoffman as a serious actor and now he suddenly shows up in a role of a funny guy? The other reason why meet the Fockers is worse then meet the parents is because Ben Stiller (Gaylord) has not a big role like the first part, meet the parents.He, Ben Stiller, was THE reason why meet the parents was funny and such a success but his role is much smaller in meet the Fockers then I wished. The story of meet the Fockers is also less amusing. It is too much about sex sex and again sex. I mean, a movie can be funny without constantly talking about sex (main part of the lines of Dustin Hoffman were about this subject).An other reason why part I was so funny was because Ben constantly did things wrong without having the intention to do those things.

The fact that Barbara Streisand looked the same as she did in the 60's with the same curly wig and bell-bottoms, I found rather distracting but not nearly as cringe-worthy as the intensely inappropriate questions she asks her son, despite the fact she's supposed to be a trained therapist.I really can't believe that this cast thought their lines were funny. It was like having Dustin Hoffman and Robert de Niro delivering garbage. A complete waste of their brilliant talent. And the same goes for Ben Stiller. The baby was funny the first time...OK ...maybe the second. By the 6th, I wanted it to disappear for ever.Very disappointing. I cannot give it more than a 5.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Refreshing, well written, and well acted.","I was really happy with Meet The Fockers. I was not sure if it could live up to the first movie and I was expecting a lot of lowbrow humor. There are, of course, some lowbrow jokes (all of the play on the Focker name), but it is, for the most part, funny without getting too crude and without a lot of bad language. It was refreshing to see a comedy that was funny based on the merits of the writing and the acting, rather than depending on base humor and sight gags. Dustin Hoffman was superb and DeNiro gives a performance where you forget it is DeNiro you are watching, which is great considering all of the expectations that come with him. The laughs never let up and the story, in the end, is about accepting your family for who they are and about dealing with the obstacles that life throws at you. If there is a negative about the film, I think it is the editing. It felt really choppy in a few spots. But that did not prevent me from enjoying the film. It exceeded my expectations and I highly recommend it if you are in the mood to laugh and have a genuinely good time at the movies. Bravo to all involved in making this picture.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Vulgar antics,"Do not see this movie. Do not spoil the affable ""Meet the Parents"" with the thoroughly unpleasant ""Meet the Fockers"". Do not replace the memory of so many fine and respectable performances by these veteran actors over several decades with the vulgar and idiotic antics you will see in this movie. Let's not continue to perpetuate this kind of moronic movie making. The first film was very funny, along the lines of ""Flirting with Disaster"". It's not just that the bathroom humor is distasteful - it's distracting. You often wonder when seeing a sophomoric film what it would have been like without the crude humor. You don't have to wonder, in this case - the same film exists without the crassness of the sequel. These two films could be used in a writing class as examples of how a scene, or a whole movie, could be funnier without playing to the lowest common denominator. In America that denominator appears to be getting lower, year after year.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Gawd, it's too much to handle","Gawd, how do I start....OK, dun get me wrong...I mean this movie is one hilarious flick. Comedy couldn't get much better than this. This comedy is truly a comedy in every sense of the word. I mean in my summary above refers to the amount of humor that are being slotted in a single scene. Too much for me handle...even too much for my stomach to handle my laughter. I've got few people in the theater laughing their hearts out that coughs followed afterwards and many other had tears running down due to too much giggling.And of course there were lots of claps here and there. Surprisingly, there was an applause at the end of the movie.I know my comments might seem overly hysterical but my friends and I thought of seeing it again.It's a great flick to catch but a warning though. It's a highly sexually-charged movie so might be a taboo for some. But at least it's classier than the SCARY MOVIE series.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Barbra Streisand is awful!,"From only filming her from special sides and her incessant whine of a voice, she is the reason why this film is so bad. Save your money and go see something else!

Well not exactly. He is more like a robotic drone, sent out to destroy this film and all the viewing audiences free time. I think he must have been sent by the evil mecha-Streisand from south park.

Dustin Hoffman is cool,"I HATE sequels, but this one wasn't bad at all. Although I have to say that the first one was better, i have to give a lot of credit for Dustin Hoffman's character. He truly was the life of this movie. I loved how there were familiar faces once again. Most sequels only bring back the main characters, but even the most minute...example would be the flight attendant who over reacted with Stiller's character on the first movie. One thing that I didn't like about this movie was how Mother Byrnes character seemed more blank than before. SHe seemed almost retarded. I don't know. Pam seemed expressionless throughout the show. I think her character was better the first round.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Waste of Talented Cast,This movie is a monumental waste of talent . A terrible script that is all set up and no payoff like when DeNiro's monstrous motor home blocks traffic or when the maid's son looks identical to Greg there are no payoffs . As a collection of bathroom humour jokes go I guess it succeeds . Once again Hollywood tries cashing in on a marginal hit and fails miserably. Hopefully this dreadful film will tank at the BO so we are never again subjected to such a juvenile movie . DeNiro et al should have known better than to agree to a sequel to a movie that barely broke even at the BO . It is understandable that Stiller is in this film as he has zero acting range .His facial expressions run the gamut from 'A' to 'B' zero of 5 stars for 'Fockers',1.0,Anonymous,Romance

As good as the first!,"Meet the Fockers was one of those sequels that almost surpasses the original! I loved it!The best part about this movie (besides the fact that it you could laugh out loud in the movie theater and NOT feel like a total dork) was that it was long. Lately all comedies have been short, leaving you wishing it was longer. Meet the Fockers was almost 2 hours long!!! Yay!!!All of the familiar characters of Meet the Parents are back along with some, well, INTERESTING, strangers. Barbara Streisand was incredibly funny and, of course, Robert De Niro was also a riot.However, my favorite person in the entire movie had to have been Dustin Hoffman, as Greg Focker's father.I totally, seriously think that you NEED to see this movie so PLEASE get up and go see it!

Not as Funny as Meet the Parents,"I consider myself a prude. I was actually embarrassed for stars of such caliber as DeNiro, Streisand and Hoffman. At least Danner had the decency to play her role very low key. Sorry gals and guys who like such potty language. Hope you enjoy it. I got a little tired of the #1 and #2 jokes. It did have some really cute moments. I loved the cat and puppy dog scenes. I think the scene with Striesand leading her class of Sr. citizens in exercises was well done, but could have been funnier without the last shot of the poor old people acting like over sexed bunnies. But that is only my opinion as a senior citizen myself. DeNiro was a bit over the top as his daughter's surrogate breast for his grandson.

Meet The Fockers EXCEEDED my expectations!,"Meet The Fockers was an undeniable HOME RUN! Today is Dec. 26, 2004...rainy...gloomy (uncharacteristically cold and depressing for Florida) so, we figured we'd be the only people in the theater. By the time the previews were over, we were shocked to see the theater 'packed to the walls', everybody came...families, couples and even people by themselves, every age group and genre. From the beginning of the movie, the theater roared with laughter...most obvious was the large group of people who just couldn't stop laughing. I was one of them, this movie builds and builds...it's NOT 'one laugh after the other....it 'IS' ""one laugh 'on top of' the other"", genuine great comedy...it references and ties-in with Part I...a flawless continuation...one part was so heinously directed that I jumped out of my seat along with numerous others who were blown away by this hilarious part...there was a 6.0 (richter scale) type scream in unison and a few 'hundred' people shrieked, screamed, laughed, coughed, cackled uncontrollably, clapped and couldn't get it together before the next hilarious thing happened. I'm asthmatic and I had my inhaler with me...I'm glad I did! This is the hardest I have laughed since ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"", ""Dumb and Dumber"", ""Elf"" and the ""Meet the Parents"". This film is superbly written with seamless transitions, juicy plot, it impeccably lives up to your 'acting quality' expectations (due to the excellent cast), the camera work is brilliant, lots of 'surprises' in it, it is 'NOT' predictable, it's a well-thought-out sequel that I feel far surpasses the 'laugh-o-meter' readings of 'Meet the Parents', Hoffman and Streisand were outrageous, Stiller was Brilliant, the catastrophes that take place are choreographed so well that it IS 'believable' and you're reeled-in hook, line and sinker onto the funnest and funniest laugh-fest roller-coaster this season...I was still laughing when I got home and I embarrassed my husband to death at the theater because I was laughing much too loud (I don't usually do that)...it got to the point that 'my' unbridled laughter (in itself) was cracking up my husband...I, basically, laughed as hard, long and as loud as I humanly could in-between breaths...not just because I wanted to laugh, but because I couldn't help myself...this movie delivers the goods, it's beyond funny, it's magic...the perfect ending to my Christmas weekend! I can't wait to see it again and again. Even after everything I've said, the movie will still 'exceed' your expectations!

Toilet Humor,"This film can be summed up in two words: toilet humor. It's really strange to see the same Ben Stiller of ""The Ben Stiller Show"" doing dumber and dumber comedies, and it seems my wife keeps dragging me to see them. In that movie he made with Jennifer Anniston, there was a lot of bowel and toilet gags. Okay. Fair enough. But in THIS movie, barely a year later, we see a dog flushed down the toilet by a cat, and we hear Dustin Hoffman utter the words ""If it's yellow, let it mellow, if it's brown, flush it down."" Not to mention Robert DeNiro talking about making ""number one"" and ""number two."" So this lightweight comedy starts in the toilet and never gets far from it. A highlight? Barbara Streisand. Her performance is actually quite good and natural; she may have a future in sophomoric comedy like this. She lit up the screen. Robert DeNiro, however, looked like he knew how stupid this movie was and wasn't crazy about being there.Grade: C-.Fun things to watch for: statue with huge phallus, Ben Stiller's one-note performance, busty housekeeper.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hysterical movie!,"This could also be called ""the worst possible nightmare of meeting the parents""! This movie was just hysterical - we laughed through the whole movie. There were some slightly tasteless jokes, if you're easily offended, but they were certainly funny. I can't wait to see this movie again! Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand make the most perfect couple - they should become the current Gable and Lombard - and I think they should start making movies of their own. There are certainly options for continuing sequels, such as Meet the Fokker Baby, Fokker Kids, etc; I'd love to see the two of them together again.

Each scene is contrived and false, it loses all coherence as any kind of competent film.Of course there are no real rules for comedy other than a film needs to be funny, but it helps to have believable characters and plot, otherwise, awkward and amusing situations don't work.

"At times unrealistic, , but overall, a very good film","I saw ""Meet the Fockers"" last night and was pleasantly surprised. I went into the movie with low expectations, but left the theater more than satisfied.The plot is at times somewhat unrealistic. Hoffman's and Streisand's characters can be a little over the top and there are a few plot strands that seem rather contrived. However, the great acting and the hilarious script made me more than willing to suspend disbelief and just go with story.Beyond its comic value, in a sense, this film taps into the current cultural divide in America, with the liberal, free-spirited, and open-minded mindset represented by the Fockers, and the traditional, conservative mindset represented by Jack Byrnes (DeNero's character). Streisand and Hoffman play a sex therapist and former attorney turned stay-at-home dad, respectively, while, of course, DeNero plays a former CIA agent. The tension between the two poles allows for some great scenes.And, of course, Stiller's character is stuck in between, trying to negotiate his way through the tension and keep things running smoothly. He makes repeated attempts at pleasing Jack, but such efforts are largely futile. For most of the film, he suppresses his own instinctual impulses to try to do things Jack's way. Of course, doing things ""Jack's way"" does not work for Greg, and he ends up apologizing for his inability to succeed using the Jack method. But as the story progresses, he becomes less apologetic, and by the end of the film, he takes an affirmative leap and transforms as a character, rejecting his former submissive and Jack-pleasing self, and adopting a more take-charge attitude. Only by being himself does Greg gain the respect of his new father-in-law (Jack), even if that true self subscribes to a very different ideology than does Jack.It is very rare for me to leave a movie theater fully satisfied, but ""Meet the Fockers"" was definitely worth every penny that I paid for the ticket. Not surprisingly, it wasn't quite as good as the original, but, comparatively, was a much better sequel than most. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

If these serious actors actually cracked a smile at any line in this screenplay (besides the title), they must have been smoking the best weed in town. I wouldn't have even snickered if I was high.

Ben Stiller is creating great comedy. I love his ability to create characters.

And enough with the play on the Focker name!! It gets old after about the 30th version. Just too tired overall. And the ending came too easily... Was that cop scene a shout out to the Reno 911 TV show (which is really a terrific show in its own right)!?! That scene was the only think remotely funny... Overall a big waste of time and talent.

Meet the Fockers: 8/10,"Can you remember all the way back to 2000? Julia Roberts stole her Oscar from Ellen Burstyn, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon opened the door for mainstream foreign movies, and Meet the Parents was nominated for one-only one-Oscar: Best Original Song. No Best Supporting Actor for the toilet-using Jinx the Cat. No Best Director for the scene where the human waste flies onto the house. Meet the Parents was robbed, I tell ya! Well, not really, but it surprised many people, especially skeptics thinking that Robert De Niro couldn't do comedy. Obviously, they were proved wrong, and therefore there were no surprises when Meet the Fockers came out. Except that this movie also featured Dustin Hoffman in his latest role (his fourth of the year) and Barbra Streisand in her first role since God knows when. Actually, strike that. I was surprised by Fockers, because I actually liked it. A lot.Gaylord ""Greg"" Focker (Ben Stiller) and Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo), whose marriage was approved by Pam's parents Jack (De Niro) and Dina (Blythe Danner) in Parents, now have to go to Greg's parents before the wedding. The straight-laced Byrneses are in for a surprise when meeting Bernie (Hoffman) and Roz (Streisand) Focker. A liberal, carefree Florida retired couple, they couldn't clash any more with the Byrneses (of course, would it be much of a movie if they did?) The two families go through mishaps and misunderstandings, with very funny results.One complaint I had with Parents is the sheer impossibility of some of the antics. Someone basically burning a house down, and then letting human waste cover the yard? Not only is it improbable, it's also crude. Focker only really had one scene of toilet humor (literally), and other than that, it was all slapstick or wordplay. Very funny slapstick and wordplay, I might add. Hoffman and Streisand play amazingly well off each other and everyone else. The casting of those two is probably the best casting choice of the year. This may be Hoffman's best role since The Graduate-no lie. The completely off the wall way he plays Bernie is great and really works well for the movie. In fact, all of the performances are great.Not only that, but it's also funny as hell. It's mainly the typical zany mishap comedy, but there's a lot of great dialogue, too. The addition of a baby, Little Jack, added a good amount of humor (adding to the minor ""breast pump"" issue of the first movie). But LJ seemed to just be a necessity, to show that, yes, the two movies are different (as if the addition of Hoffman and Streisand weren't enough). Still, the laughs were constant and strong, something that can't really be said about almost any other comedy that's come out within the past five or so years (except for, of course Parents). Although I've been so tardy with my reviews (and I saw Fockers late in its run), I'd really suggest this movie. If you liked Parents, you'll like this one even more.My rating: 8/10 Rated PG-13 for crude and sexual humor, language and a brief drug reference.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

The director and screen scribblers should be nailed to Mel Gibson's cross and dragged through Hollywood for everyone to spit on and jeer at them. Meet the Parents was mediocre. This is a worse offense because of the gross abuse and waste of money and talent. Movies such as this should be fined a fortune to fund independent films.

It is funny that with the Globe and Oscar awards coming on, there are on the market all kinds of fast made movies, with big house names, one more mediocre then the other in artistic value,which plays no role on the fact that those movies are presented and nominated like the best of the year in directing as well as acting,totally overlooking the real fantastic performance of Jim Caviezel In The Passion Of The Christ as best actor with no equal in his craft and Mel Gibson as Director just because of spite, sabotage, conspiracy and political reasons. If Hollywood thinks that people with real values are stupid, they are living in a world of their own, where they can not see the difference between sexy and vulgar, classy,refined or gross, good taste material or blue material, morality and immorality,Godly or Ungodly, real Faith or Religion.

The female stars were OK. Stiller's embarrassment of his parent's quirks and desire to impress his future in-laws is really comical. Meanwhile, the overly conservative Jack Byrnes(DeNiro)scans the Fokkers for reasons to prove why they do not ""qualify"" to be married into his family. I've never been a real DeNiro fan, but loved him in this movie. This could be one of the best performances in Robert DeNiro's career.I'm normally disappointed and get quite irritated with profanity/vulgar language in films, but the strong performances and incredible humor really overshadowed the various instances of off-color language.For certain this movie is a 9 and maybe even a 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pointless sequel to 2nd rate movie,"There really was no point in trying to milk the cash from this cow.

Being the 'likeable' guy what an amazing twist for one of his characters. Nobody came out of this movie with even a mediocre performance. I wish somebody benefited from this movie, I really do.

Don't.,"The absolute worst sequel I have seen since Batman and Robin. It completely rehashes the plot of the laziest episodes of Dharma and Greg, stopping momentarily for jokes from the first movie. Actors came out of retirement for this? The basic plot--Greg is embarrassed that his parents are too wacky and free-spirited for his new in-laws--is set up and killed in the first twenty minutes. Then, it's set up again and killed over and over. To make the movie long enough, we get subplots involving animal hijinks and a babysitting gig gone wrong. Har. The casting is all just for the stunt. Once we see who the new parents are, we laugh momentarily with recognition, but then no one does anything. The script is so contrived and lazy it sets up scenes that go absolutely nowhere, some that don't even seem finished. But hey, if a dog getting flushed down the toilet is your idea of comedy, and it's the sort of thing you expect from Deniro and Hoffman, then get in line.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

The cream on Dustin Hoffman's face...not funny. The football game...foolishness. From beginning to end...humorless. Dustin Hoffman is introduced crossing arms in front of the camera as if doing Karate. Is that supposed to be humorous? It looked idiotic.It's hard to imagine how a comedy could be entirely humorless with such celebrated actors. What a waste. But then it starts with the script and this script is poor. The attempts at acting for this script turned moldy. The producers and director are as much to blame for using this script. It is such an excellent premise and it's hoped someone in the future will use it to make a good movie. The script should be written by someone who knows humor, and the movie made by people who can recognize it.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
A cult classic,"I can never get enough of this movie!

just not funny,"At least meet the parents had a few funny lines, even though the rest of the movie sucked.But i cringed the whole way through meet the fockers. Not only did i only laugh maybe once, but it actually made me feel uncomfortable. The unstable relationship between idiot gaylord and jack was really annoying.Of course he's gonna get into some stupid situation and make a fool of himself and jack will hate him even more, and the situations he gets into are not just absurd and ridiculous, but just not funny! And dustin Hoffman - man, what a great actor. But it's lost in this trash, he doesn't seem at all comfortable with the role, and of course was not funny either. Barbara Streisand is the only actor who felt relaxed and performed decently, and she was a bit humorous.I honestly don't see how anyone can laugh at loud at this stuff - don't think i don't know comedy when i see it, i've seen a ton of comedies from the mel brooks films to the snl films, and i've definitely enjoyed watching them and laughed hysterically. But meet the fockers is a complete disappointment....2/10",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
This sequel lived up to the hype.,"There were so many subtle inside jokes that could best be appreciated if you had already seen the original, ""Meet the Parents"". I started laughing when character roles from ""Parents"" reappeared in ""Fokkers"". It started early with the airline flight attendant at the ticket counter. Recognizing her and remembering the airplane scene from Parents made this scene even more hilarious because they did a switch that heightened the comedic effect and rolling laughter. You could tell by the laughter or silence of those around you who had seen the original movie when other characters appeared in cameo or ""code"" words or phrases were used in the dialog.I'd recommend that you rent the ""parents"" DVD before you shelled out the $$$ for this one. It would be well worth it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"All cringe, no comedy","The setting of this movie is the first encounter of the respective parents of an engaged couple; the premise is the expectation --- which is certainly realized --- that both bride and groom will be somewhat embarrassed by their parents' (chiefly their fathers') little ways.Hoffman and de Niro do their best, I guess; they act their socks off trying to out-gross each other as the ghastly fathers apparently maximizing the embarrassment of their wives, their offspring, and each other. They do what they can with the setup and the screenplay, but this movie can only have been designed as cringe comedy --- there is no visible attempt at other kinds of humour --- and the result is all cringe, but no comedy.My one note of praise and wonderment is for Bradley and Spencer Pickren who play Little Jack, the de Niro character's grandson, who has not yet learned to talk but who has an extensive language of signing with the hands to communicate with his family --- well, with his grandfather anyway. The performance of these toddlers is marvellous. The rest, including Streisand, do their best with an expensive backers' nightmare, a lead balloon.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the best sequels...,"... ever. I've seen the first one and it was good. At times too much slapstick comedy, but it was a good movie, especially due to DeNiro's superb acting and his quirky character.Usually I do not care too much for sequels, because they are aimed towards making some money and are mostly lame. Not in this case, even though it raked in a ridiculous amount of money. DeNiro is one of my favorite actors, so I thought it can't be that bad, if he accepted to star in it - he can't be that desperate, can he?. But the all-star cast of that movie, especially with a powerful Hoffman and an adorable Streisand is a perfect 'circle'. Stiller is just trying to be funny, but unfortunately he can't deliver in the vicinity of such awesome performances. Even Blythe Danner, who stars in !Huff - and she does a superb job - out-acts Stiller. Stiller tries, but he neither reaches the level of acting nor has he the experience, he is just a comedian, not a good actor.The story runs along the lines of the first movie, except the both families get to meet each other. That provides for some comic momentum, as well as the totally different characters of the family provide for some hilarious sit-com. The story if somewhat predictable, especially towards the end, but that does not really matter, because that is not the point. Hoffman and DeNiro just act it out, so to speak, and it is just a joy to watch them both in full swing. More than one time I was not only smiling, or giggling, I was laughing out loud and slapping my thighs because these two are awesome.There are few scenes where they transport so much humor, without being too 'humoristic', if you catch my drift. If you have seen it, you will know. Just pay attention to it. My favorite scene is the one where Hoffman tries to hinder DeNiro from leaving with his RV. Absolutely awesome!I did not give it the whole 10, because of a few small glitches in the storyline, mostly because of Stiller, who plays good, but simply can't keep up with the others. And last, but not least, because of the prospect of another sequel, which is certainly possible due to the commercial success the movie had. So, 'just' a niner from me.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Disappointing film,"I really enjoyed ""Meet the Parents"" and was afraid to see the sequel because I was afraid i would be disappointed. After seeing it, I was shocked at how disappointed I was with this film. Apparently, Barbra Streisand turned down the film several times before agreeing to do it. She should have gone with her gut instinct. ""Meet the Fockers"" is mediocre, cheap and embarrassing. It is full of bathroom humor and sex jokes. The actors did the best they could with the uninteresting script. Ben Stiller played the same uptight character who was in ""Along Came Polly.""I regret seeing this film.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Fockers"" is better than the original","""Meet The Fockers"" breaks the mould in comedy sequel tradition by being better and funnier than the first, without simply playing out the same situations with a twist. It even makes the bold step of slightly altering the formula that made ""Meet The Parents"" such a hit.Just like in ""Meet The Parents,"" Gaylord Focker (Stiller) is still tentatively trying to appease his fiancé's (Polo) overbearing father, Jack Byrnes (De Niro), who is quite possibly more intimidating now that Gaylord is in Jack's ""trust circle."" Despite the smiles and awkward pleasantries, it's clear to everyone that tension still runs deep between father and future son-in-law, and what better way to strengthen the bond between Focker and Byrnes than to have both families meet? Of course, anyone who would name their child Gaylord must be astronomically different from the tightly wound Byrnes family, and therein lies the premise. But you already knew that.The one true strength ""Meet The Fockers ""possesses that sets it apart from its predecessor is its basis in characters. While ""Meet The Parents"" was all about putting Gaylord in the worst, most humiliating situations possible, ""Meet The Fockers"" is about polar opposites and how they interact. That's not to say, however, that there aren't plenty of humiliating moments for poor Gaylord Focker  there are plenty. More on that later. Another driving force behind this sequel's success is its storytelling, an element that is greatly strengthened this time around. The storyline is more cohesive, and there is a clearer sense of plot structure, rather than simply skit after skit. Similarly, there is more attention paid to setting up the climax, so the audience truly feels a sense of satisfaction by the movie's end.The success of Meet The Parents can be attributed to a single factor: situational comedy, or, more specifically, putting Gaylord into as many embarrassing situations as possible, while his fiancé's parents watch in horror. In ""Meet The Fockers,"" Gaylord isn't alone in a world of Byrnes; this time the Byrnes are put into equally awkward situations as the sex-obsessed Fockers say one crude thing after another. That isn't to say they are unlikable. If that were true, the movie would fail. But it does mean that much of the movie's humour comes in the form of a sex-related joke. It's not necessarily a terrible thing, after all, it is very funny, but it somehow cheapens the comedy.""Meet The Fockers"" is a hilarious movie that does its predecessor one better, never stooping to simply rehashing the best jokes from ""Meet The Parents."" Strong characters, clever (although wince-inducing) situations, and a strong storyline make ""Meet The Fockers"" even better than ""Meet The Parents,"" and most definitely worth seeing.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A fair movie, but a disappointment none the less","The critics absolutely ripped this movie apart in the papers by me (The Philadelphia Inquirer) They gave it one and a half stars out of four which I felt was a little bit to harsh. If I was rating it on the common 4 star rating system, it would get a flat two out of four stars. Some scenes were funny, for example when Gaylord (Ben Stiller) is left alone with his soon to be nephew, who is an infant. As an overall I compare this movie to ""American Wedding"". Just a bunch of jokes and gags that were trying to be duplicated from the first movie. Robert Deniro's character just comes off as down right mean and mental rather than humorous. You will laugh at the movie if you enjoyed the first one but it does not compare.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Remarkably good sequel to the original movie,"Of course this film is a sequel, and sequels are generally less better than the originals - not so in this case, this is almost as good as the first film without the ""novelty"" aspect. Robert De Niro is the best of the lot but I thought Barbara Streisand and Dustin Hoffmann were very interesting additions to the family ! Of course you can't produce a clone of the first film ! Novelty has to be introduced but there are several re-hashes of jokes from the first film and recurring themes but with new additions. I don't think the Director could have done better as far as sequels go !! I have seen the film twice in the last three weeks, once in the UK and the ten days later in Paris, France. Second sitting, I caught up on some jokes I missed the first time round ! I'll definitely be adding this one to my DVD collection when it comes out !! It's the ""clash of characters"" between De Niro and Hoffmann that really wins the day in this one, plus the expressions of the little baby boy ( which is a novelty ) compared to the first film.What WAS missing was a nice theme tune to replace the INIMITABLE ""WHEN YOU'RE A FOOL IN LOVE"" from the first film. I think sound-track-wise this sequel is far less well endowed than its predecessor. In France the film has the curious title ""Mes Parents, Mon Beau-père et moi"" ( My parents, my father-in-law and I !!!)",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
sequel that should have been aborted,"This movie was long and drawn out. The acting was weak, by all standards. Deniro doesn't belong in this kind of movie and Barbara Streisand doesn't belong in any type of movie. The plot was identical to the first movie, which had a weak plot to begin with. The baby made the movie even more unbearable. What's more is the fact that they continually milk the joke of saying the last name of Stiller's character over and over again. I guess that's their way of sneaking in excessive profanity in a movie while still keeping it at a PG-13 rating, so they can line their pockets with greater profits. This movie, however, did not let me down in one aspect. It continued the tradition of sequels topping their predecessors in terms of lousiness.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

Embarrassing....yeah really,"The first thing that struck me when watching this movie, was ""How is it possible for two of the greatest actors of modern cinema to appear in this pile of steaming feces?"" I am naturally referring to DeNiro, the same man who oh so greatly portrayed Travis Bickle in ""Taxi Driver"", and Hoffman who played the autistic Raymond Babbitt in ""Rain Man"".I watched this movie at a friends house, after we voted on ""Sleepy Hollow"" and ""Meet The Fockers"". Damn Democracy for all time! Three to two wins. Some of my friends friends told me that it was a funny movie. I thought ""Ok, lets see what Mr. Stiller can dish up in 1h 50 min""... Was I very disappointed? yes. Did I laugh during the movie? No.On the cover of the DVD it said ""One of the funniest comedies of the year. A Must-see"". What a joke.

Juvenille humor at its best (worst),"Hackman, Hoffman, Streisand, and Danner are delightfully dysfunctional in this sequel that works. Add in poop jokes, and breast obsessed baby, and lots of little side events I swear they stole from my family reunion's videotape and this movie will make anybody who does not take life too seriously laugh. You almost have to feel sorry for Gay Focker (Stiller). I do not recommend watching the extended versions an some of the DVD's it is too choppy and disruptive, be patient and watch them separately as deleted scenes. Complaint - as with most sequels it relied too much on content from the first movie for some of the basic laughs, but there was enough original material to overcome that minor annoyance. Otherwise if you like the first, I definitely recommend watching the second one to help finish the all-American portrait of its dysfunctional families.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Strung out series of sophomoric jokes re: sex,"What a disappointing movie!

Are they that desperate for money/ That willing to sell out for money? If they were making their money on pictures like this so they could afford to do indie films that they care about, that would be nice.

Ben Stiller's parents are really funny ole Fockers,"We don't buy many movies, but we went out to pick up this comedic gem after viewing it in the theater. Yes, they play off the name quite a bit, and that bit is rather amusing. What truly sells this picture are the parents of Ben Stiller's characters. Dustin Hoffman is an absolute riot as the Focker patriarch, and once you see her you feel that only Barbara Striesand could have fulfilled the role as his wife. They mesh wonderfully. Meanwhile, Stiller's character undergoes the torture of having his future in-laws (and future wife) learning much more than they need to, which only amuses the audience more. While somewhat overshadowed by the elder Fockers in this sequel to Meet the Parents, Robert DeNiro is again wonderful as the up-tight former CIA agent who is to be Gaylord Focker's pappy-in-law. For a guy who demands on a ""family circle of trust"", he sure doesn't seem to be very trusting. A little truth serum, anyone?",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
DeNiro Meets Hoffman and This is The Result????,"Who would have thought that a pairing of two screen legends would result in such drivel?

Hoffman and DeNiro barely interact.

Better than the original!,"I saw this with my wife and was pleasantly surprised. I thought it was going to be more of the same from the original but after seeing a preview of the ""footy ball"" scene on Jay Leno I thought we should give it a try.With the original I found the grilling of Gaylord by his potential father-in-law funny and amusing. But when the whole movie is full of it, it gets very annoying very quickly. Fortunately for this sequel, it has a saving grace in the form of Gaylords parents, Bernie and Roz. What a breath of fresh air. I feel stuffy and uptight while watching DeNiro (maybe cos DeNiro's character is stuffy and uptight) but when it switches to Bernie and Roz I relax and the laughs came out a lot easier.Maybe I felt for Gaylord after going through the same thing when I was in the process of marrying my wife.I have a 1.5 year old son but the baby in the movie just annoyed me. The baby in the movie though was quite smart in baby signing.This movie is good fun. A more balanced experience than the first movie and my wife and I definitely enjoyed it more.

Slapstick? More like Dipstick,"The Fockers has had a long run in New Zealand movie houses, and good reviews, and since I'm hearing impaired, visual humour appeals. The first few minutes were kind of funny, and intriguing, why was Greg and his lady being treated so generously by airline people? The introduction of Little Jack and his ""signs""(were these computer generated? if not the kid playing the part knows sign language) also held promise.From then on, it was mostly downhill. No, it was all downhill. Maybe Kiwis find old folks being taught kundalini sex exercises somehow exotic? Maybe they've got fond memories (the audience was mostly older folk) of Streisland and Hoffman in their younger days?I thought the actors did their best, all bar De Niro. His was a key role (obviously) and he just wasn't up to it - the comedy for want of a better word. The actor for that role needed to be a caricature of an ex FBI man, but played straight, not grimace grotesquely. Danny De Vito would be my number one choice, or the tall thin guy who played the crooked cop in L.A.

Robert De Niro is great again as Jack Ben Stiller is a funny as hell as Gaylord/Greg Focker but is the new roles played by Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand that make this movie more than just a reworking of the first movie.Hoffman is great and looks to having great fun on screen overacting in his role as Bernie Focker and I admit when I read that Barbra Streisand had been cast as Stiller's mom I did not think she was right for the role but boy was i wrong she is great and has some of the best lines of the movie.I just hope that down the line they can get this great cast together again for one last movie just round the Focker Byrnes story up.,10.0,Anonymous,Romance

If you ask me, Bernie (Dustin Hoffman) and Roz (Barbra Streisand) were really offbeat people. This was because of their lifestyle and the greeting on their answering machine. Well, the greeting was funny. It was funny, but weird. I mean, who would ask their spouse to make them a chimichanga in their answering machine greeting?

I didn't expect much of the film but it was even worse than I had expected. For the first half hour or so I kept waiting for the film to start and wondered why the scenes seemed so loooong. Later I found out that it's because all of the film is long and boring. I didn't even laugh once. Although I have to admit that I don't like this type of ""it can't get any more embarrassing""-humour. Brits are good at this kind of humour but Americans just aren't. The problem is Ben Stiller's parents (Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman) are depicted as crazy freaks. So their exaggerated behaviour is just a logical consequence and not funny. In a British film the parents would have been normal and then the fun would have come from their behaving in a freaky way. I just wonder who or what made quality actors like Robert de Niro, Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman sign for this film. Robert de Niro is even co-producer. The script is lame, the jokes are bad and simply embarrassing without being funny.

How often does a sequel overshadow the original?,"Where does one begin? Delightful story line - casting A1A - scenery more than excellent ! The return of Robert DeNiro and the ever-beautiful Blythe Danner was a no-brainer. The cute couple, of course, worked. But, who would have thought to match up Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand? When I first heard of this pairing, I thought: ""HUH?"" What a thoroughly enjoyable experience to see these two masters of their craft make movie magic in this story.Dustin Hoffman was deliciously outrageous - what a wonderful role for him, at this point in his career. Barbra Streisand was equally outrageous, and has NEVER been more beautiful ! Even though she didn't sing (would not have worked in this film - Shucks!), it was a stroke of genius to place her in this role. She's so great at playing the Jewish card, as she has been throughout her career.An excellent feature of the film, ala James Bond, was Robert DeNiro's RV - seeing the ""secret hatch"" where his covert stuff could be executed was very cool. Equally enjoyable was his character's ""softening up"" at the end - actually being willing to become more human.Best Film Of The Year Oscar ? Why Not ?",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

There were many times in this movie when it was so close, and with Dustin Hoffman and the rest of the cast, it should have been funny.There may have been lots of funny stuff in the second hour, but I was not willing to wait it out.

It isn't without its flaws however, but neither was the first one. Though in this movie DeNiro's character seems to have reverted back to the way he was during ""Meet the Parents"" and in some aspects he seems even worse this time. The RV seems a bit much too, I don't think they just give those out in the CIA. However, those minor faults aside it is well worth a look. I love the way the movie started out with everything going perfect for Focker and his bride to be, but you know the exact moment when the tides begin to turn with a simple bloody nose.

This joke has already been told,"Meet the Fockers is the sequel to Meet the Parents, which was a very funny movie starring Robert DeNiro, Blythe Danner, and Ben Stiller, in which Greg (Stiller) has to meet his fiancé's (Teri Polo) parents, Jack and Dina (DeNiro and Danner) so he can ask Jack for her hand in marriage. Sadly enough, Meet the Fockers, even with the extra star power of Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand as Greg's parents, fails to deliver the goods as well as it's predecessor.This movie follows shortly after the first one, and Greg has planned a trip for his fiancé and her parents to meet his family before they get married. There is a major clashing of personalities between Jack, who is an uptight former CIA agent, and Greg's father, a former stay-at-home dad, and mother, a geriatric sex therapist. Since this is a sequel, it has to be compared to the first movie. This one just wasn't as funny, and the devices that were used to carry the jokes seemed desperate.

I love my wife dearly, but alas, her tastes in movies is not the same as mine, and that's the nicest way I can put it! I really hated this movie. There really wasn't anything funny about it. I'm so sick of Ben Stiller! He's NOT FUNNY! I loved ""There's Something About Mary"", and Ben was okay in that, but not particularly funny. Why does he continually appear in unfunny movies? Why, oh why? Also, unlike ""Mary"", none of the other people in this stink pile were even remotely funny. Sometimes I can enjoy a movie that is supposed to be funny but isn't, but this wasn't one of those. There really wasn't anything interesting or engaging at all.

I've been 'Fockerized',"Okay, I was *extremely* prepared for this to flop, but surprisingly, like a few others on IMDb, I enjoyed this more than the first! I heard so many bad reviews, but I think that people were so hyped up about the sequel, it was unfairly viewed.Barbra Streisand and Hoffman were brilliant! I was both surprised and pleased at their performance! ^_^ They brought a lot to this movie.I also hear there is going to be yet another sequel, ""Meet the Little Focker"" well, we'll see how that one goes!

Why Was This Movie Made?,"I really liked ""Meet The Parents."" I thought it was great, and it is one of those rare movies that I have seen many times, but never really got old. I thought that ""Meet The Fockers"" might at least be decent. And I'll admit there were a FEW scenes (I can't stress that enough) that made me laugh (i.e. the fake breast). This was basically the movie, A newly married couples parents meet for the first time, and GUESS WHAT, they are complete opposites of each other. But wait, THERE'S MORE. ONE OF THE FAMILY'S HAVE A FUNNY NAME!!! That is the complete depth of this movie. A joke used once or twice in the original was churned out at least 10 or 15 times. ""Ohhh you crazy mother Fockers!"" HILARIOUS. The other 45 minutes is spent one DeNiro's character talking about his circle of trust. It reminds me of a movie that AWESOME-O from south park would have suggested. I don't know what to say, this movie sucked. And if theater tickets weren't so damn expensive I absolutely would have walked out of this crap.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very good,"It was a hilarious movie. I laughed so hard all the time. Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman offer a good contrast to the roles of Blythe Danner and Robert Deniro. It has a lot of sexual innuendo, so don't take children so young to the movie. They have opposite types of parents, Greg Focker's parents are a new age hippie type of parents, while the Byrnes family is a more conservative, uppity family. Greg Focker's parents talk about sex all the time because his mom is a sex therapist. So it creates plenty of tension and misunderstanding and it creates very humorous scenes. There is also an interesting plot twist in the movie also that adds to the misunderstanding and surprise. The actors are brilliant. Everyone is a great actor, I say it is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I strongly recommend everyone to go see it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Gutter-grade,"I find it depressing that so many people have focused on the humour (or not, as the case may be) of this film. The over-riding thought in my mind as I was subjected to this film concerned its vulgarity and the degenerate nature of a society that could sustain this as commercially popular entertainment.Getting a baby to say 'arsehole' - how supremely clever and hilarious. Joking about masturbation, incest, the incessant 'fucker' joke, etc, etc, etc. If you find that kind of filth so funny as to bypass your conscience, I pity you. If IMDb would have let me put a one word review I could quite happily have done so:Trash.My opinion of the actors involved is lessened. And was it funny? I couldn't care less - it didn't pass the common decency threshold. I seriously wonder if some of you would applaud paedophilia so long as it gave you a laugh. Oh, sorry, now you do have conscience?",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Funny sequel!,"I think the funniest character in this movie is an unlikely one. It was the baby. Gaylord was up to his usual shenanigans again because of the pressure he is under to please his future father in law. The highlight of the movie was the contrast in lifestyles and generally mentalities of the Focker family and the Byrnes family. The Fockers think that the Barnes family is uptight and the Byrnes family think that the Focker family leaves a lot to be desired in terms of disciplines and principles. The baby, the pets and of course Pam and Gaylord are caught in the middle of this fiasco trying to please both families. It makes for an interesting story line where at the end a resolution must be made for the sake of the happiness of Gaylord and his wife to be of course centering on Jack's ability to yield and compromise for the sake of his daughter's future. I would definitely recommend this one for a night of laughs and humor. Personally I think it was more intriguing than Meet the Parents.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Movie Made for Laughter!,"Meet the Fockers was much better to me than Meet the Parents. It had more of a story and included more comedy than the first. I had treated my friend to this movie and before the movie had started he was really depressed and tensed. So as the movie traveled on he suddenly improved in affection and started laughing and enjoying himself, and believe me, if you would see him before the movie you would never guess that a smile would appear on that face. So the movie had been on for an hour and his face was dying red. It turned so many colors in that two hours that I got scared and wondered if he was okay. But now I know that it was just because of laughter. So when the movie got over, we bought two more tickets and watched it again because neither of us had got enough. So I would say that this is a movie made for kids thirteen and above since it does have some content, but should be seen if you need to laugh or have fun.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
bad movie,I think this movie sucked major ass. Definitely did not compare to the first one and was a major waste of my money. Deniro has hit an all time low with this movie and Stiller sucks as usual. Barbare streissand is not that entertaining and Dustin Hoffman has a few moments. I think this movie will ruin Deniro's career and Stiller really does not have much of one so he's OK. The only good thing to come out of this movie were the previews. For all you star wars fans you can catch a preview for the episode 3 movie. Overall I think this movie sucked and if you agree with me post your comments and if you don't feel free to express your freedom of speech as people on IMDb always do.

great movie,"for once i thought that this movie was exceptionally funny, each actor played their character to a tee, and to top it off the one person that i thought shined throughout the movie was the baby (twin brothers in real life). Unlike most BAD sequels that are only done to make easy money, such as Terminator 3, i have to admit that meet the fockers beat out its first creation in meet the parents. I saw this film twice in the theatres, and from my personal experience that doesn't happen often, so that should tell you what i thought about the movie. As well the movie is not directed to one specific demographic, you don't have to be a genius to understand whats going on, even an 8 yr old could watch and be ammused, its great to take the girlfriend/wife or even bring along the family to watch it!!! p.s. if i remember correctly was it not the biggest box office hit on Christmas day?",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Meet the Fockers is abundant in real life, 21st century issues that everyone can relate to-- especially during these evolving times.I must admit Barbara Streisand's character was my favorite. For not having acted in 15 years, she did a remarkable, amusing job playing ""Greg""'s mom.Most definitely 10 times better than the first, and in my ""Top 10 Movie List""!

Streisand and Hoffman Lend Buoyancy as Mother and Father Focker in a Minor League Comedy,"It shouldn't be too big a surprise that this movie is a fairly mediocre Hollywood confection, but I did have a whimper of a hope that this was going to be an edgier social commentary given the comedy potential of the situation. Alas, it would be too much to expect director Jay Roach to be in the same league as David O. Russell or Alexander Payne given that his track record is mostly made up of Austin Powers movies. I never saw the original ""Meet the Parents"", so luckily I don't have that point of comparison, but one can easily fill in the blanks with this soft-centered sequel. Written by Jim Herzfeld and John Hamburg, the plot seems ready-made from an instant pudding mix. Having given permission to Gaylord Focker to marry their daughter Pam, the white-bread Byrnes family from Oyster Bay now prepares to meet their new in-laws in Florida (of course).Simple enough, but the big surprise is that Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand (third and fourth-billed, no less) seem to be having such a great time playing Bernie and Roz Focker that you can almost overlook the script deficiencies. Each had auspicious film debuts over 35 years ago (he in ""The Graduate"", she in ""Funny Girl""), and they have known each other since their struggling New York days in the early sixties. That history is helpful in explaining their natural chemistry here, and you're left wondering why these two never worked together before. Streisand, in particular, seems relaxed as a free-wheeling, caftan-wearing, opinionated sex therapist, which seems like a send-up of her self-important psychiatrist in her own ""The Prince of Tides"". For once, she's not bathed in candlelight in some Harlequin romance with a blonde gentile unable to commit. Rather, she lends credibility to a grounded character in an often hilariously passionate marriage to a physical and intellectual equal, and at certain moments in this film, I don't think I've liked Streisand more on screen.If Hoffman seems less surprising, it's only because he has already proved to be a masterful comic actor with ""Tootsie"" and ""Wag the Dog"". Even when the running gags (a passion for capoeira, overzealous displays of affection) get tired, he still imbues his caricature with a zestful spirit. The remaining elements of the film seem tired in comparison, and unfortunately I have to include the original stars. Perhaps it's because they are recycling behavior that would be hard to refresh a second time. Robert DeNiro's tiresome portrayal of Jack Byrnes, the intimidating ex-CIA spook, is particularly disappointing and not so much because the actor is slumming (which he is) but because his character works on only one motivation, to humiliate and eventually eject his future son-in-law from the ""circle of trust"". There are hints that the summit meeting of Hoffman, DeNiro and Streisand would turn into something more substantial, but the sitcom dimensions of the script quickly extinguish the possibilities. Ben Stiller, who is the actual protagonist of this comedy, seems to be sitting back as his character, Gaylord, recedes into the background. He has exactly one funny scene on his own, when he spouts his honest feelings after being injected with a ""truth serum"".The whole subplot with Gaylord being accused of fathering his former family housekeeper's son seems tired and superfluous. I like Blythe Danner as Jack's wife, Dina, looking to resuscitate some spark in their marriage, and Teri Polo, who actually seems sharp and worthwhile as the fiancée at the center of the story. But neither is given much to do except a funny scene where Roz uses hand puppets to teach Dina how to get sex out of Jack. If seeing DeNiro wearing a homemade rubber ""manary gland"" sounds hilarious, by all means go see this movie. For me, it just made me think how it would be great to see Hoffman and Streisand re-team in a James Brooks comedy, how DeNiro should go back to Scorsese for career guidance and how Stiller may want to take a break before he plays yet another nebbish character. By the way, I'm guessing Streisand's ""A Star Is Born""-era hairdo is an in-joke to her partner since her character's name was Esther Hoffman. Now that's the kind of subtlety this comedy needed.The 2005 DVD features two versions of the film - the theatrical cut and a completely unnecessary extended cut, which edits in several deleted scenes. Like the DVD treatment for ""Ray"", the additions are announced to the viewer through a blinking gimmick and consequently inhibit the flow of the narrative. It's better to see these understandably excised scenes separate from the film. Roach and editor/co-producer Jon Poll provide a so-so commentary track, and there is also a fitfully funny blooper reel. Several disposable shorts are included, among them ""Fockers' Family Portrait"" featuring brief snippets from Hoffman, Streisand and Stiller; a behind-the-scenes look at Jinx the Cat (""Inside the Litter Box""); another behind-the-scenes look, this time at the infant (""The Adventures of a Baby Wrangler""); a five-minute featurette on ""The Manary Gland""; and a Today Show interview with the entire cast.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
meet the fockers.,"Let's just say, Gaylord Focker, (Ben Stiller) and Pamela Byrnes, (Teri Polo) are going to get married. The first film meet the parents, Greg has gone to meet Pam's funny parents, but in meet the fockers, it's a different thing altogether! Pam and her mum and dad, have gone to meet Greg's wired up parents, they have a dog, Mosies, and the Byrnes have a cat, Jynx, not a very good start eh? The Fockers family are more likely obsessed with sex. When Pam, Greg, and the Byrnes arrive at the Fockers house, they realise that Greg's parents are fairly silly. The Byrnes family also have a baby this time, little Jack, LJ. I am fairly approved at this movie, it is a very good comedy, an upside-down hilarious film that makes you laugh your head off. Ben Stiller is amazing though, if you have seen him in any of his films he is fabulous, I watch this film over and over again.

Should have been good,"This should have been a spectacular movie. Think about it: you have Hoffman and De Niro, who were practically gods at one time, playing a washed-up hippie and a washed-up warmonger, coming together for their children's wedding, like a self-referential, super satirical version of ""You Can't Take it With You.""That's what it should have been. Instead, it's a complete mess. I don't even know how to describe this movie. It goes on for what seems like five hours, during which a bunch of stuff happens, and none of it is funny. Ben Stiller stands around giving that stupid pucker-faced wrinkly-eyebrowed expression he uses in every damn one of his movies, and whines. Blythe Danner wanders around saying her only line--""Oh, Jack""--over and over again. Teri Polo stands in the background without doing anything. A baby swears and points at breasts. A dog humps things. A foreskin falls in a fondue pot. On and on and on. I hate this movie. I can't figure out if Hoffman and De Niro were trying to get recognized again, if they just wanted a few extra bucks, or if they're just plain going senile. Whatever the case, it's a sad waste of talent, and a sad movie. 0/10 stars.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Lacks originality,"Meet the Fockers is an average comedy. There are a few laughs, the new characters work quite well, I found Dustin Hoffman to be particularly funny; but the movie lacks the edge of the original. The movie had all the cringe worthy moments of the first film but three years on they don't have the same effect. The writers have recognised that the film required a new angle but rather than taking a clever witty tact they have gone for lowest common denominator humour, which I think cheapens the film. The concept was itself an obvious follow on from the first movie. Essentially this move is more of the same but the same just isn't as funny the second time around. I hope for the sake of the original that they don't make ""meet the little focker"".",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Boom Mic Operator should have been replaced,"The movie itself had it's funny moments and I honestly enjoyed watching it but I soon became distracted by the number of times the boom microphone appeared at the top of the frame. My wife first pointed it out to me early on in the movie and from that point on our main attention was to watch for it and tap each other on the knee when we saw it. Now, I've seen the microphone appear at the top of movie before but usually only once, maybe twice. In this movie it appeared at least every 5 minutes. At times the Grey fuzzy wind-cover of the Mic looked like someone was dangling a dead cat above Dustin Hoffman's head. I can understand a flaw like this in a low budget independent film or a home movie but this is a big budget film with Hoffman, DeNiro, and Streisand for goodness sake. Someone (director, editor, test audience) should have caught this before it left the studio.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

...If You Must,"I didn't see the first film, Meet The Parents, and it doesn't seem that I missed much. I figured that Streisand had to be worth a look and she is, in fact she and Hoffman steal whatever there is to steal. The success of Robert de Niro has always eluded me and he does nothing here to convince me he is anything more than a journeyman actor at best. If a performance consists of pulling faces then yes, he's a great actor but I like a little more than that if anybody asks you. Teri Polo is unbelievable as Stiller's fiancé, by which I mean that I can't believe what anybody let alone Stiller would see in someone so wooden and unprepossessing.

For the money....,"That has to be the only reason for these stars to appear in this supposed ""comedy"". The title's cheap joke tells you right up front the juvenile level of most of the humor here. And it goes downhill from the title.Streisand's appearance is the only bright spot in this shameful mishmash. De Niro is totally miscast as the WASP father. He attempts to play a character (mostly by trying hard to eliminate his Bronx accent) but other than that he walks and mugs his way through the picture. I can't for a moment believe that Blythe Danner's character would be married to this person. But maybe that's intended as part of the joke. I wonder.Hoffman never stops talking, in a way that's almost (but not quite)as annoying as Woody Allen's ""schtick"" in his movies.I watched this on cable to see what all the fuss was about.

Robert DeNiro and Blythe Danner were superb as well. Adam Sandler and Teri Polo were just terrific as the young couple. The baby (played by twins) is absolutely adorable.

Wait for it to appear in your neighborhood videostore.,"I give this 4 stars out of 10.This is a sequel to Meet the Parents. The story is basically that the parents of both the bride and groom meet to get know each other. The movie had its moments of laughter but not enough compared to the first movie. A friend a mine and I had an argument over my low rating for this movie, arguing that this movie should stand alone rather than be compared to the original but I think this is totally incorrect. It was due to the strength of the original movie that gave the impetus to make this sequel and unfortunately, the sequel just did not measure up to the original.I have to confess, one of my biggest problem was casting Barbara Streisand as the mother of the groom. I just cannot stand her. She is annoying both on screen and offscreen. I tried hard to not let that influence my rating of this movie but subsconsciously, it probably did. I did like Dustin Hoffman as the father of the groom. It's refreshing to see him play a comedic role now and then.It is not a movie that you need to go out and see in theater.

Terrible,What else can I say? This was just a horribly unfunny film. And they thought that adding Streisand was a brilliant casting move?!! You've got to be kidding.

Were they that desperate to capitalize on the success of the first film that they threw everything but the kitchen sink at this piece of garbage? There's nothing to see with this film. Ben stiller is naturally funny but everyone else needs serious help. This film was a disgrace and absurd for the other actors.They could have done some fun things with a sequel but instead they chose to pad the film with big name actors in hopes of attracting a bigger audience.

"Not a consistent sequel, not funny","'Meet the Fockers' the the sequel to 'Meet the Parents', which was a very good romantic comedy film involving a guy named Gaylord Focker who tries to fit in with his girlfriend's family. 'Meet the Fockers', however, is a horrible sequel with in-your-face comedy, which maybe only generated a couple of small laughs in the 1.5 hours of film. The humour in this film is not nearly as subtle as the original, and it is a ruder sense of humour which focuses primarily on sex. 'Meet the Parents' is a much better film with subtle humour across a wide range, and there is a sense of feeling for the characters, while the characters are thrown around in 'Meet the Fockers' to be as rude as they can be. (Humour such as the scene where the foreskin accidentally finds its way thrown into a pot of hot chocolate is rather disgusting - in my sense of humour - and not at all funny, but I guess that some people did find this funny.) I would suggest you see 'Meet the Parents' and do not bother with this film. It is completely different from the humour in 'Meet the Parents' that it is not a good sequel anyway.

Ridiculously over the top,"Ridiculously over the top characters ruined this. The first film was OK, and while the acting talent & occasional laugh (in the looser sense - more a snigger) saved this film from being a complete disaster it was still pretty awful.The Hoffman & Striesand characters were pathetic, they seemed to be scribbled together at the last moment & made up as the film went along & were inconsistent. It was as if, they had to come up with as diverse as possible characters to the opposite parents, but they never came across as that, just two idiots.The child was especially irritating & never likable, the animals seemed only there for some childish gags, the scene with the truth drug was absurd and cringeworthy, only DeNiro's character had any substance and thought behind it, and while very good - even he was over the top.I never grasped why he had so much influence over the grandson, where the parents were & whether their schooling methods on their son were identical. While it was merely for a laugh in a comedy film, the methods at times seemed more suited to the Fockers.The rest of it was cheap knob & sex gags which were more cringing than funny, which summed up most of the film. 3/10.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

DeNiro is a comedic genius and his facial expressions and devilish intentions are a riot. Little Jack was the bonus. How they got him to make the expressions he did is beyond belief. If you are looking for a movie that is pure fun, has a great atmosphere, keeps you on the edge of laughter throughout, and makes you feel that it was a great movie well after you have seen it, then this movie is for you.

Disappointing,"I didn't demand too much from this film - I had hoped that it would be one of those films where I could turn off the brain and laugh along with the zany humour.Alas, that the humour seldom moved beyond laughing at the word 'focker' or seeing a child say 'ass hole'. There were a few good moments but it all seemed rather laboured. A pity really as it wouldn't have taken much to improve it significantly. The fault lay in the screenplay as the actors did as much as you could expect of them. It was lovely to see Barbara Streisand with her earthy presence and De Niro, Stiller and co were fine. However, there was a lack of range in the humour and an overly constrained plot which was not helped by the vast majority of the film taking place in a handful of similar sets.Worth seeing but nothing like as entertaining as the first film.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

I also liked that they put a few references in this movie about the first movie because it made things funnier. I would see this movie again in the future",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A pitiful sequel,"Sickeningly contrived tripe. If ever there was a ham-fisted attempt to cash in on the popularity of a movie, then this was it. Only half-wits would write some of the praising words that are on here. If you are by chance a half-wit then you would probably think this film is a riot.The first film was brilliant in many ways, and maybe this raised the level of expectation, but even if it did this pathetic nonsense was too much to bear.

I really liked the movie but it wasn't like the first one,The movie was really funny but not like the first one ... and thats only because the first one was so good I thought that went on and on for longer than it should of and the baby thing wasn't that funny. of course Deniro saved the movie because he's hilarious when he does those Focker jokes and I thought Dustin and Barbara were not funny... only in the telephone message where they're yelling I have one question though ...What is the song playing when Jack (DeNiro) is walking his daughter down during the wedding ... it was very smooth and Owen Wilson was blowing that flute thing ... doesn't this site usually give soundtrack listings thanks a lot,8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The writers tried too hard.,Did the actors read the script before accepting their roles? Dustin Hoffman accepted one of the most porous roles for a credited actor. Most of what he does is so abstract that it's not funny. A lot of the humor in the movie is predictable. Because of that I found it to be a bit embarrassing. I felt sorry for the actors in the movie instead of feeling for the characters. This movie never made it out of the infield. Dustin's character was not believable. It seemed the entire movie revolved around him instead of using Ben Stiller as the one who made us all feel so incredibly uncomfortable in the first movie. The writers seemed to forget Ben is the one who masters satire.,3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Superior to the original,"A highly watchable and entertaining comedy. It is also better than Meet the Parents which I found too cruel and cringe worthy with elements of bullying (such as the endless ridiculing and name calling levelled against Greg Focker, around the swimming pool netball scene).This one also has the added bonus of Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman, both of which deliver great comic performances. Robert De Niro is also funnier and more likeable in this one as he has enough 'opponents' to bring him down a peg or two.Film critics and many reviewers should just accept that a lot of sequels are a great improvement on the originals, end of.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Meet the Disappointment,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""Meet the Parents"" and Dustin Hoffman is one of my favorite actors. So, I was looking forward to ""Meet the Fockers"". I really wanted to like it, but I have to say I was disappointed. There was more subtly to ""Meet the Parents"". For me, what made the original so great was the subtle awkwardness between Stiller and DeNiro.(i.e. ""That was beautiful, so much love and yet also so much...information."" I think Dusty and Streisand were too over the top, and the humor was a little broad and crude for my taste. A circumcised penis foreskin landing in food doesn't really do it for me. Nor did Streisand riding DeNiro ""like Seabiscuit."" I enjoyed the parts with DeNiro and Stiller interacting with the kid, though its inexplicable that his parents would be gone, and not even show up for the wedding. There are some laughs, more if you're high, but it could have been a lot better. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Then, from joke to joke, I got entertained and kept watching.Jokes are below the belt, and the clash of values between the families is really funny, and in fact this is what really matters when you want a funny film. Not for the whole family but for grownups it will be laugh out loud.I was also pleased to see De Niro and Dustin Hoffman and a surprising Barbra Streisand, who are so serious, capable of the best dramatic performances, in something so refreshing.

3 laughs = 3/10,"This movie had three Hollywood legends, one brilliant comedian, and 3 bits that made me laugh.One bit was the end-credits sequence where Ben Stiller talks to the camera.Another was when we were introduced to Ben's possible offspring.The funniest was when Ben Stiller was given the truth serum, and embarrassed himself at the party.Every single minute of this film (besides those listed above) is a complete waste of film, and an embarrassment to the talent involved.The script is flat, the direction sloppy and amateur, and the characters are 2 dimensional and lacking of ANY purpose.Don't see this garbage.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

Ben Stiller's parents in the movie were a little over the top but completely believable (I've never been a big fan of Babs but she looked great and did a wonderful job and it was nice to see Dustin Hoffman in a comedy again. The two looked like they could have easily been married to each other for 40 years).There were a few cringingly embarrassing moments (which was the desired emotion, I suppose) but all in all a very pleasant two hours spent with old and new friends.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Meet the Fockers is a forking bad film.,"Meet the Fockers is the second weekend from hell for Greg Focker (Ben Stiller), a male nurse engaged to marry Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo). The first weekend-from-hell was Greg' introduction to the parents of the bride Jack and Dina Byrnes (Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner}. respectively. Greg and his future in-laws, traveling in Jack' million dollar bus, head south to meet his parents Bernie and Roz (Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand, respectively) in their Florida home. A cultural collision awaits both families. Jack, a retired CIA agent strung as tight as a drum, and his wife Dina are in a word, WASPs. The Fockers on the other hand are Jewish; Bernie is a stay-at-home civil rights lawyer and Roz is a sex therapist with a home 'office'. Greg Focker just wants to survive this weekend with all his body parts in tact. The Byrnes' would be happy if they avoided all bodily contact. The Fockers intend to wash the families' dirty laundry and share Greg's teenage sexual exploits with the Cuban maid.Meet the Fockers is a forking bad film with a shop-warn story line, obvious gags and a predictable outcome. The story line is a knockoff of the TV situation comedy now in reruns, Dharma and Greg (1997) sans the talented Jenna Elfman. This film is a casting nightmare. Barbra Streisand in the role of a sex therapist is a casting oxymoron. It's well known that Streisand suffers stage fright; perhaps this is just a survival instinct at work. Dustin Hoffman paired with Streisand gives the film ethnic overkill without expanding the scope or characteristics of the cast. Robert De Niro demonstrates why sequels rarely work; his character is stale and he looks like he's in pain. Blythe Danner is perfectly cast, but her role is marginal and there are few opportunities given her to rescue the film. Teri Polo as the young bride-to-be projects as the 36-year-old bleached blond actress that she is, not as virginal young bride. Conversely, Ben Stiller at about the same age is a pretty good fit.Meet the Fockers is lowbrow comedy that milks a pretty successful and creative prequel for all it's worth. The best scenes and lines were cherry picked for the previews, so frequent moviegoers may feel like they've already seen this film.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
very disappointed,"I wanted to see this in the theater because Meet the Parents was so good. I laughed so many times during that movie, but the sequel was terrible. I hardly cracked a smile. All it is is sexual humor and it gets boring. I felt bad for the parents who brought their 10 year old kids to this expecting to see a lot of cat humor or mistaken identity. Instead it was close to an R rating because of the sex talk and raunchy words.And Greg's parents, the Fockers, were not funny. Hoffman and Streisand were bad. The baby with the head butt provided a little smile. And DeNiros's character had some funny moments too.It seemed like I kept waiting for something to make me laugh, and it never did. I nearly fell asleep during the last half hour, and I'm sure I missed some dialogue. But I really don't care.FINAL VERDICT: This is one film they never should have done a sequel to if all it was going to be was sex humor. I don't recommend it and definitely not for kids.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great sequel,"Actually I'm not sure which film was better Meet the Parents or Meet the Fockers. Both films were equally enjoyable. This movie is really funny. Maybe it's because of a cast but everything works in this film. It's probably one of the best comedies made in this decade. Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand both did great as Gaylord's parents. Every character of this movie had it's own opinion and that was well portrayed in their dialogs. Not like the original, this part is more making fun of Robert De Niro's character than of Ben Stiller's character. I noticed that this film has many similarities with it's prequel but that's OK because it still was very funny.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Embarrassing -- it sure is.,"The tagline for this film is: ""And you thought your parents were embarrassing."" I presume this tagline refers to how the actors in the film must feel. Compared to the embarrassment of being in this stinker (or having written, produced or directed this, worse yet), nothing else seems embarrassing in comparison.I cannot imagine how some well respected actors lowered themselves to the completely infantile level of this film! The fact that the reviews and ratings are not MUCH worse is easily explained by the fact that many potential viewers with even a modicum of good taste were warned away by the title and promotional material which, at least, is fair in that it portrays the film to be just as asinine and low-brow as it actually is. The film is amazing in that it leaves me in awe over how sadly our culture has sunk when a film like this, and like many similar films, can actually do quite well at the box office. If you think you might find the film funny, you could probably do almost as well by simply eating a can of beans and then sitting in the bath tub for the evening.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Smooth Clean Comedy,"I was very excited to watch this sequel, because I have really enjoyed watching the Original and ""Meet the Fockers"" really met ""My Expectations"". It did not take me a long time to recall the characteristics of every personality. The actors have not changed a lot, yet the have changed somehow. I had a feeling that I was on vacation in Florida with the two Families. The contrast between the two families is treated in a very funny and easy way that you don't feel like judging or taking sides. The load of stars gives you the feeling that you are watching some big motion picture, which is in fact big, but free from all the complications. You can notice the super stars Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand try to outshine each other, but this was for the Movie's good. The story touches the Jewish community in a very sensitive and realistic way without belittling or degrading any other communities or religions. I guess after all Jack Byrnes has learned his lesson and the end was very nice and convincing. To conclude, I recommend watching this movie with a large bucket of popcorn and some company, you will have some good laughs and no doubt a quality time.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
De Niro + Hoffman + Streisand = Migraine,"Having just been disappointed with the sequel ""Ocean's 12"", and, surviving another holiday season with family, two hours of 'Focking' bickering, arguing and angst had my head aching and stomach in knots. De Niro's despotic role as an ex-CIA agent was void of humor, and made me wonder who would entrust a darling child, Little Jack, into the care of this psycho. Streisand's in-your-face sex therapist, while cute at first, wore thin rapidly. Hoffman looked great, and had a couple of cute scenes, but like his on-screen wife, he too made me weary. Danner seemed intoxicated throughout the mess of a movie, and what was director Jay Roach thinking when he left in the scenes with the truth serum and the sub-plot about the illegitimate son? Stupid, degrading and not funny. Stiller, the butt of attack from the entire cast, including Little Jack, was able to project his stress and anguish directly to my digestive tract. With apologies to the rubes who audibly gasped when the baby picked up a container of glue, and roared whenever someone fell down, I give this movie a solid 4 out of 10.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Get Fockerised,"It's been a couple of years but now get ready to meet the Fockers. Talk about embarrassing parents.

The movie is as funny as its title - not too,"The Mrs Focker is a sex therapist, and that drives much of what passes for humor in the movie: the tension between propriety and openness. Some humor based on the excretory functions is a change of pace. And there are some jokes based on the different approaches to competitiveness between the two families. This is the aspect that I found most amusing, if pressed on the issue. Sequels often fail to live up to their promise, and it may be only that stringing two good movies in a row is difficult. The actors seem to do an adequate job of portraying the persons created by the writers, but the expanded premise was too worn out to be still funny.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Funny but nothing close to Meet the Parents,"This movie kept me laughing at times but paled in comparison to the first movie. It appeared as though the writer was more concerned with the introduction of as many sexual innuendos as possible (horny dog, exploits of a sex therapist, phallic symbols all over the house, etc) rather than keeping with the type of comedy that made the first movie such a success. It was the innocent, slapstick type of comedy that made the fist movie as funny as it was and kept the audience laughing. Purchasing the first movie is a must but I wouldn't think of investing in the sequel. While Robert DeNiro was as funny this time as he was in the original, Dustin Hoffman disappointed me as he can be much funnier with his keen wit and quick one liners.Nice try but I'll stick with the first one!!",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
A truly shallow movie that feels more like a Hollywood cash in than the sequel the first movie deserved,"I consider myself to be a big fan of ""Meet The Parents."" It's one of the movies from my generation that will surely live on as a classic years from now. Perhaps the most notable thing about MTP is how well it fares on repeat viewings- It's just as fresh and funny today as it was when it came out. So, there was no doubt I was excited when I heard about ""Meet The Fockers."" While most of the time I am wary of sequels being pointless cash ins, it was different with this. The thought of the crew from the first movie going to meet a new set of parents seemed like it could make this sequel another classic- perhaps even better than the first.Instead of a classic, we got a movie that lacked the personality, depth, and overall likability of the first one. I can remember enjoying this movie in the theater, but knowing that it didn't quite reach my expectations. When I got it on DVD, it took one showing before I realized that this movie was not very special- it was a movie that took a terrific premise, an all-star cast, and mountains of potential, and decided to squander it all by creating what felt like a soulless Hollywood cash-in.A good way to examine how this movie failed is to compare similar scenes from this movie and its predecessor. The one type of scene that stands out to me most is the dinner table scenes. In ""Meet The Parents,"" the dinner table scene was one of the most memorable, everything from Greg's rendition of a table prayer to him trying to back over his previous lie about breast pumps by telling a story about how he milked a cat as a boy was classic. Instead of hilarious conversation delivered perfectly by terrific characters, we have (mostly) the same characters sitting around a table, performing shallow, disgusting sight gags, where a piece of foreskin winds up in the fondue pot. I don't necessarily dislike raunchy comedy, but it doesn't always work in this series, and unfortunately, it almost never worked in this movie.The strong point of the original movie was the way it wove so many different awkward situations and mini-disasters together, and how it managed to be much more than the average ""disaster comedy,"" thanks to a great script and outstanding performances from Stiller and De Niro. Thankfully, Stiller still brought his A-game for this sequel. De Niro did a fine job as well, but there are times in this movie where his character is easy to despise. In the original movie, we knew that his character was a jerk that showed respect to no one but himself, but we were still able to look at the situation and meet his actions with some recognition of understanding- I mean, who could blame Jack for being angry about Greg accidentally burning down his daughters Wedding altar? In this movie, Jack seems to be looking for reasons to bring Greg down, and instead of talking misunderstandings over like a mature adult, he simply results to despicable acts and temper tantrums to get his way.In addition to the stars of the original movie, this movie, of course, adds the Focker parents, played by Barbara Streisand and Dustin Hoffman. Unfortunately, I was not happy with these characters. I'm not much of a Streisand fan, so I guess it was understandable for me not to like her performance. Hoffman does a pretty good job, but his character seems too over the top to be funny at times. This set of parents are extremely sex crazed (which, of course, leads to more junior high level gross out humor) and pretty much smother their son Greg, most notably with the shrine they created for him, which is full of 9th place medals. Unfortunately, I thought they wasted the great premise of the movie with these two characters- they could have been done in a much better and smarter way. You might notice that I didn't take too much time describing these characters, but that's only because I spent as much time explaining them as the writers did creating them.Oh, and I can't forget the worst addition to the series made by this movie- Jack's grandson, Little Jack, who is, quite frankly, an annoying little baby that's nothing more than a distraction. Giving Jack a Grandson to bring along is an idea that looked great on paper, but ended up transitioning poorly onto the screen (sort of like this whole movie) Basically, the kid comes along to make stupid baby sounds and look cute in front of the camera. His first words provide for some fairly memorable moments, but by the time that happens, you'll have grown so tired of the kid that it won't be all that funny. The main problem about the baby is how the camera will always cut to him, to show him laughing or making some other dumb noise in response to one of the grown up's adult problems, as if he is some wise, super intelligent baby that still craps his pants. In retrospect, the baby adds a thick, completely unnecessary layer of cheesiness and kindergarten level humor to a movie that is intended for more adult audiences. Seriously, the way he is used reminds me of a way some sort of live action Nickelodeon or Disney movie would use a baby.The pieces of squandered potential in this movie are starting to add up, and it is with sadness that I look back on this movie and see something that could have been so great be turned into nothing but a shallow, soulless husk of its predecessor.. With ""Meet The Fockers,"" we wound up with a truly shallow movie that feels more like a Hollywood cash in than the sequel that the first movie deserved.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not a patch on the original,"2000 came. So did comedy classic ""Meet the Parents"". A truly original comedy hoot, director Jay roach bought the ""you know it's gonna be classic"" formation of Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro together, as a husband-to-be and very sincere (yet hilarious) overprotective father De Niro. When I heard of a sequel, I wasn't sure at all what to expect. Sure, the original was genius, but sequels usually aren't a patch on their predecessors. As was the case with ""Meet The Fockers"".So, on comes the pairing of ""Gaylord"" and ""Pam"". Off to visit her and his parents, they fly across on first class (just everything seems to be going their way) and then, after collecting her parents, are off to his. After meeting over-welcoming ""Bernie"" and hilarious sex-therapist ""Roz"", we get the general impression where the film is going. At first, the dog-humping joke is funny. But five times later? You get a feeling they're running out of ideas. The sexual jokes are the highlight of the film, but, after a while, they seem to lose their edge. Don't get me wrong, this is a sort-of funny film, but after the outstanding original, this painfully hit-and-miss comedy just doesn't quite cut it.**/ out of ***** (2 and a half out of 5)",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Makes the original film look worthy of praise,"The only thing worse than an unnecessary sequel is a sequel that can't figure out anything new or invigorating to do with its material, so it resorts to recycling the same structure, humor, and plot-points from the original film. Meet the Fockers is a uniformly lazy picture, yet only slightly placing itself a few notches below its grossly overrated predecessor. The film all but affirms the purpose of its franchise's existence is to subject Ben Stiller to one lifeless comedic setpiece after another, to make Robert De Niro a continuously intolerable character, and to take a cast that practically oozes personality and make them a boring assortment of caricatures.It all starts with the rehashed plot; this time, instead of Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) meeting his fiancée Pam Byrnes' (Teri Polo) parents, and enduring the awkwardness and uncertainty that follows, Pam, her notoriously strict father Jack (Robert De Niro), and her mother Dina (Blythe Danner) will travel from Oyster Bay, New York to Long Island by RV to meet Greg's mother and father. Also going along for the ride is Little Jack, Jack's one-year-old nephew who he simultaneously cuddles and teaches how to be a grown up despite still being an infant.One of the first shocks to Greg's family is, despite Greg being so controlling and tightly wound, Greg's parents, Bernie and Roz (Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand), are so liberal and relaxed. The two welcome Jack and Dina with open arms, despite an evident behavioral shock taking place during casual conversation, as Bernie and Roz love to be open and free to discuss sex with their friends. Real drama, however, sets in when Greg reconnects with his old housekeeper Isabel Villalobos (Alanna Ubach), whom he slept with at a young age. Isabel now has a son that looks mysteriously like Greg and was birthed in a window similar to when him and Isabel slept together. As one can imagine, this causes immense discomfort between Greg and Pam, all while Jack is still trying to get Greg to fess up, as he believes he still isn't nearly as honest as he claims to be.The overblown nature of these films is what kills their vibe; their unsubtle humor works against every joke in a way that discredits the situation and the subsequent events. These films would work much better had to been conducted on a realistic scale, but when you have a cat who can flush a toilet, a baby who hears over three dozen simple words a day, yet his first word is a polysyllabic profanity, Greg's parents are such mind-numbing dolts who have no idea how to treat guests, and their is the possibility of an illegitimate son nobody spoke about, then the film becomes so far off course in its narrative it might as well be science-fiction.Furthermore, Meet the Fockers, as you'd expect, cops out with over a dozen jokes about Greg's birthname of ""Gaylord Focker."" This shows nothing else besides lazy writing on part of Jim Herzfeld and John Hamburg, as they continue to cherrypick elements from the previous film. However, if Meet the Parents was good for anything, aside from being a sitcom display of humor, it was also slightly original and tapped into the nervewracking idea most men have when it comes to meeting their girlfriend or fiancée's parents. It reached out and explored that often unexplored area of anxiety and nervousness that stems from what should theoretically be a very positive and respectful time for both parties. However, due to the desire to not only impress, but wow, there is a discernible level of anxiety that takes over and frequently makes the first couple interactions so awkward and unsettling.Yet Meet the Parents, as stated, what a sitcom display of such events; a bogus, redundant collection of overblown scenarios that Meet the Fockers replicates in an even more mediocre fashion. Talent that has proved themselves worthy of high recognition succumbs to the repetitive nature of situational antics, most of which fall flat on their face and provide nothing else for the characters to do besides frantically run around and scream bloody murder at every turn. Meet the Fockers is a monotonous exercise that, in turn, makes its mediocre predecessor appear worth of praise.Starring: Ben Stiller, Teri Polo, Robert De Niro, Blythe Danner, Dustin Hoffman, Barbara Streisand, and Alanna Ubach.

I've never felt so dirty,"Remember at school when you used to get beaten up, get your head flushed down the toilet, get pushed into doggie doo, have the bully wipe boogies on you and then spit on you? If you do, I'm really sorry for you. I can't imagine what that was like...actually I can, because I spent $14 to see ""Meet The Fockers"".I LOVED meet ""Meet The Parents"". Loved it. Own it. When you put 3 of my favourite actors into a comedy, I'm bound to be pleased...unless it's in a shameless sequel. ""Meet The Fockers"" takes us to meet Greg's parents, played by Dustin Hoffman and Barabar Streisand. Don't get me wrong they're great actors, I loved ""Rainman"" and ....actually can't think of any Streisand movie I've seen but I hear she was massive in the 70's. Their characters are terrible though- two sex crazed lunatic extroverts. Greg obviously knows they won't get on great with Pam's folks..and he's proved right. While they are there, there are of course lots of unbelievable accidents and events, each more over the top than the last (and less funny than anything in the first, except maybe when Greg babysits).I didn't laugh during the movie at all. Maybe smiled twice. Maybe it was funnier than I thought but I just felt so ripped off and dirty I was slightly tainted. It was clear the producers thought ""Man I can't believe how much people liked Meet The Parents.

One-gag comedy - 52%,"I'm not normally one who watches sequels without watching the original but when your new flatmate (one of three) plugs in her DVD, why not go with the flow and enjoy what gets thrown in the tray? Thus, it was that I sat down and watched ""Meet The Fockers"", the sequel to the enormously popular comedy ""Meet The Parents"". Stiller has never recaptured his form from his best film ""There's Something About Mary"" but here, he is completely upstaged by three old timers, two pets and a baby.Stiller reprises as the bizarrely named Gaylord Focker, the hopeless klutz engaged to Dina Byrnes (Blythe Danner). Her parents, former CIA agent Jack (Robert De Niro) and long-suffering mother Pam (Teri Polo), were 'met' in the first film so here, Gaylord takes his future in-laws (together with Pam's baby nephew Little Jack) and his future wife to meet his parents. But there is a problem. Obsessive Jack believes that Gay's father Bernie (Dustin Hoffman) is a high-flying lawyer and his mother Roz (Barbara Streisand) is a therapist but it isn't quite like that and to make matters worse, Dina discovers she's pregnant.In truth, ""Fockers"" is a very undemanding sequel which is basic in its approach to humour and fairly low in its ambition. However, it does this with such skill and slapstick fun that you fairly quickly get swept up and enjoy it. ""Fockers"" has so many gems that hit the target, such as the toilet battle between the Focker's dog and the Byrnes' cat. It certainly helps if you've seen ""Meet The Parents"" (which I haven't) because I simply found each character too exaggerated to be really funny. And the humour is simple - people falling off chairs for no reason and frequent repetition of the name ""Focker"". But slapstick humour is a dying art and when it's done as well as it is here then you welcome it with open arms.Despite being the lead, Stiller rarely stretches beyond his ""wide-eyed loser"" role. De Niro shows an unexpected comic flair as the buttoned-up, anally retentive father-in-law from Hell but Hoffman is his equal, visibly enjoying himself in screen as the polar opposite of Byrne. Streisand launches an unbelievable comeback as the kooky sex therapist and probably gets the acting nods because she simply hasn't done any for so long. ""Meet The Fockers"" is a strictly low-brow affair but one with such enthusiasm and energy that you'd be hard-pressed not to be taken in by it.

huge disappointment,"I have some major problems with Meet the Fockers. Besides the fact that it uses tired and uninspired jokes and the script is lame, The Fockers are what really get to me. In Meet the Parents I saw this really conservative and uptight father in De Niro. I felt Stiller's humility because I could actually relate to his situation, or at least imagine myself in his situation sometime in the future. This is what made the movie so good. It was hard to watch because I could imagine the movie happening in real life to a certain extent. Greg's parents are completely unbelievable, in that I could NEVER imagine the story in Meet the Fockers taking place in real life. The Fockers are so extremely laid back and open about sex that they seem fake. Let me tell you: I know a few people who have some qualities that the Fockers, but none of them have sex books scattered around their house. None of them would, in a million years, talk about circumcision at the dinner table, ESPECIALLY when they are with their daughter's fiancé's parents. Not that I demand realism in movies. Its just that Meet the Fockers was a hit because it wasn't a typical Hollywood comedy. It was a great movie in my opinion, and in many other opinions as well, because of its realistic awkwardness and humility felt by Stiller. Meet the Fockers takes every last bit of that realism away. I'm sure you know certain people who enjoyed Meet the Parents for the same reasons I did, and you also know people who liked Meet the Fockers a lot better than Meet the Parents because of its crude and over-the-top humor. Meet the Parents was an original comedy. Meet the Fockers uses the same formula that so many other Hollywood comedies use these days. Thats why it is such a disappointment.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
An Inferior Sequel to Meet the Parents,"Given the casting of Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand as Ben Stiller's parents, along with Robert DeNiro back as the hot-tempered Jack Byrnes, you'd think that ""Meet the Fockers"" would be a tremendously funny movie. Alas, I was very disappointed. The gags and dialogue don't work nearly as well as in the first film. What kind of screenwriter would think that attaching a fake breast to Robert DeNiro, or having a toddler utter profanities, or giving Greg Focker an illegitimate son, would be funny to watch? The running joke about Greg's last name ran pretty thin in the first film, and in this one, they run it into the ground. It's a shame so many talented actors had to work with such a lame script.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Nothing special,"Without Barbara Streisand and Dustin Hoffmann playing the Fockers, this movie would be horrible. I say that because the other characters just don't hold provide anything fresh, including Gaylord Focker.

I laughed a few times but not near as much or as loud as I did for Meet the Parents.We meet a couple characters from Greg's past but beyond his parents there are no other Fockers shown in the movie which was a big disappointment. I wanted to see the polar opposites of Pam's family and his old friends, like the way Greg got to meet Pam's old boyfriend Kevin and the doctor friends of the Byrnes who ripped on Greg for being a male nurse. I think that they had a good idea for this movie but it didn't really meet its potential. Meet the Fockers is not really worth seeing at a theater, wait until rental.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Much ado about nothing,I was really disappointed by the second instalment of the series. I was really waiting for this movie given that Meet the Parents was so nice. I think the story falls completely apart and that there is no real scenario. Barbra Streisand is really rusty in terms of acting. She doesn't express very much. Even the Yiddish Mame side of her character is not really sincere (although it should be quite natural for her). Dustin Hoffman is not really showing what he can really do. He is such a good comedian and I was really waiting for his performance here... Still there are a few funny gags and Little Jack is very cute but still... I left the theatre a bit disappointed...,4.0,Anonymous,Romance
takes two many jokes from the first,"it was an okay film. I don't know how such a mediocre film could make more than $250 million, i guess it just tells us what kind of movies the American public like to watch. The main problem is that the plot, although i realize is not striving to reach perfection, could at least give an attempt to reach a respectable level. What i hated most was the stupid, tear my hair off when watching, references to the first movie. I know that a sequel must stay true to its predecessor, but there is a limit. That limit was passed by the first ten minutes. And what the hell was up with the baby saying ""Ass-hooo"" was that supposed to be cute and funny. Damn. Although its not a great film what can you expect from DeNiro nowadays(what the hell was up with ""Hide and Seek"") and Stiler always sucked excluding maybe ""Meet the Parents"" and ""Something about Mary."" Don't go and waste ten dollars on it. If you really want to see it and your friends just loved it i suggest renting it, although i rather people watch a good movie like ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" or ""Million Dollar Baby"" but i guess i unfortunately don't have that power.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
How to wear out a good thing.,"The first film was spontaneous, funny and entertaining. The use of ""Focker"" was incidental and part of a long list of buffoonery to make Greg a dunce. The DeNiro character was unexpected and a good foil for Stiller.The sequel proves that a sequel can be a bomb, in spades. It is gross, it is vulgar. When you need an infant to repeat a...hole 10+ times, imbecilic characters to say Focker 20+ times and a foreskin to fall into the fondue, you have a veritable Sahara of humor. You could see the ""jokes"" coming from two hours away. Stiller, a good comic, and Babs, a decent actress, are helpless victims of an atrocious script. The DeNiro character rapidly fades to black after Stiller throws the brick.......brick, good analogy. Why Hoffman takes roles in turkeys like this one, starting with WAG THE DOG, is beyond comprehension. DeNiro could have advanced relief for our collective misery by running him over when he had the chance. As was mentioned on this Web, people who get a charge out of the word ""Focker"" will truly enjoy this movie. Other than that, this DVD will collect much dust on store shelves.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Nothing happened in this movie,"Meet the Parents was about funny events happening and Meet the Fockers was about funny things being said. If Meet the Fockers had a better script with a variety of different jokes, this wouldn't be much of a problem. I enjoyed the first 1/2 hour and was bored during the rest of the movie. I wanted some funny events to transpire, but nothing did. I was hungry for new, different material, but there was none to be found.Maybe I'm alone in feeling this way, but I have a lot more respect for comedians that can make people laugh without relying the sex jokes.

Funny during the first half...,"1st watched 11/25/2023 - (Dir-Jay Roach):
Funny during the first half, but once Robert Deniro's character goes overboard - the humor faded. This is the story of a man, played by Ben Stiller, introducing his parents to the love of his life - with the intent of them marrying very soon. The Fockers, Stiller's parents, are eccentric but kind, but his girlfriend's father, played by Deniro --- is relentless in making sure those around him are going to allow things to be done his way(whatever that may be). A lot of comedies fail in the 2nd half - that is what I have noticed with my experience, and this one did just that. Their were laughs as the two sets of parents tried to survive together - and while the loving couple - tried to stop them from killing each other. When Deniro got serious about finding the faults in the future son-in-law using his prior CIA skills - things went downhill. Deniro, Blythe Danner, Dustin Hoffman, and Barbara Streisand did their part in providing somewhat believable characters but the writing some times just came across mean. They tried to bring some laughs at the end, but once we are hurt - we're hurt. Good attempt at having a star-filled cast work on this, but the whole movie didn't cut it.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
A very average movie,"I saw this movie on Valentine's Day, even though it's not the most romantic movie in the world. The film takes a while to get going, and the story only really starts when Gaylord's parents are introduced about 20 minutes in. The character of the baby for me was annoying and unnecessary, and brought the film down to a rubbishy kid's comedy level. The overall structure of the film is very similar to the original, so if you liked that you might like this one too. Although the film had a few chuckles, the drawn out scenes seemed awkward and static. Thankfully the film does not require too much concentration, so if you're looking for an amusing comedy sequel this might be up your street. However, if you're looking for a classic Ben Stiller comedy, watch Mystery Men instead.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Truthfully, the stars of the movie were Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand (sp?), and it felt like forver until they popped onto the screen. They made the movie. I give it a five.

A few notches below your average I Love Lucy episode,"With a script pulled from a cesspool, the performers pretty much did what they could. Meet the Parents was a VERY mean spirited comedy that was more infuriating than funny. Meet the Fockers is a little milder. Jack Burns is one twisted individual. There are attempts at humor, but they are all vanquished because you never know when Burns is going to freak out and hit someone. The only funny sequence was the message therapy with Streisand and DeNiro, mainly because of the editing and comic timing which were good. And what's this new trend in animal cruelty meant to be funny? That's very irresponsible. I'm a dog lover and even though I don't care for cats, feline punishment is a real turnoff during a comedy.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
The critics were right: Not funny at all!,"If you have seen the first movie (Meet the Parents), you can anticipate the story line in this one: Dina (Blythe Danner) and Jack Byrnes (De Niro) finally meet Greg's (Stiller) parents Roz (Streisand) and Bernie Focker (Hoffman). Since the Byrnes' are very uptight, the Fockers must be quite the opposite. Hoffman and Streisand actually did their jobs perfectly and are the highlight of the movie. What spoils everything is, that Greg doesn't know his own parents and acts with surprise to everything they do. Boring. Many of the 'funny' scenes are highly predictable (boring again) or not funny at all. Like showing a middle finger to a one-year old could be funny? Anyway, the baby character could easily be excluded from the film. And the worst character? Definitively Owen Wilson. The audience at the theater went silent at his arrival on the scene. If you have seen Meet the Parents, you will be disappointed with this movie. It simply does not match up. I did not expect intellectual humor (like the hilarious Monty Python's Life of Brian), but the humor in this movie is really on the level of second graders.

Bland.,"Meet the Parents was good; I liked the De Niro/Stiller combination, and it made me laugh. Unfortunately, the sequel was boring. The only thing that saved it from the trash bin was the impeccable casting, ie. Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand. The chemistry between the pair was very palpable and they were a joy to watch. Scenes between Hoffman and De Niro were rather entertaining too, and they induced a few laughs in me.Still, the movie's strategy of recycling tried-and-tested sex jokes ultimately failed it in my opinion. It got to a point where it became so predictable that it descended into the fiery depths of banality. Meet the Fockers is a great piece of evidence that illustrates the vast difference between American comedies and British comedies; just compare this to, say, Love Actually, and you'd get my point. Perhaps Meet the Fockers will score with people who don't really like to think, but its low-brow, un-intelligent brand of toilet and sexual humour is something I've seen so many times already that it failed to hold my interest for a significant period of time.In short, a waste of talent and money.

Pure waste of time / money,"Meet the Fockers has to be the most pathetic sequel to a movie I have ever seen in my life...

This film features nothing but low sexual references/humor in order to keep the audience laughing; it just so happens that this was not the case for me. After about 30 minutes into the movie the ""sex"" jokes got lame, and the only thing keeping the movie going at that point is a baby that says ""@$$hole"" repeatedly and Ben Stiller trying to make us laugh with his stupidity. Worked for a while but does not cut it for me. Look at this movie rating yourself and you tell me if it's worth being called anything more than a disgraceful letdown.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Family sagger!,"I haven't seen the original (""Meet The Family"") and so came to all these characters afresh, which I appreciate probably wasn't the case for most of its viewers. On the strength of this, would I go back and watch its predecessor, well, maybe...This movie is a strange mix of the infantile and mildly prurient, the producers possibly hoping that the mix comes together with a ""family movie"" at its centre although for me I saw the swings between these two extremes as far too obvious, not to say crude. I mean all that stuff about Barbra Streisand's sex-therapy teachings, humping pets and De Niro's artificial boob, plus the not-even-funny-the-first-time play on words on the title family's name.Of the big star talent on show, I actually liked Hoffman and Streisand's turns as Stiller's touchy-feely (and then some!) parents, both having a romp with their crazy characters. Unfortunately De Niro (like Meryl Streep) only really has one comedic mode, the same grizzly sourpuss he initiated in ""Analyze This"" - you suspect that Hoffman could have played his part but not the other way round. Stiller straight-mans it for all he's worth - he's a likable enough actor, as is his hapless character, but even without knowing much about his other screen roles, he seems to be in the same comedic typecast cul-de-sac of the likes of Jim Carrey or worse Adam Sandler.The narrative is paper-thin and seems to move along a plot-line of placing each character in the most embarrassing situation, usually with sexual connotations) especially Stiller's. And, sorry, movies which rely on babies or pets (or both) for cheap laughs just don't work for me.No, Hoffman and Streisand apart, this movie barely left an impression on me and thankfully Ben doesn't seem to have seen fit to add another sequel to this particular series, thus sparing us the likes of Al Pacino and Julie Andrews as a psychopathic uncle and prim and proper aunt...",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Calling the dog in the film is insulting to the Jewish people.  Hollywood never would have tolerated naming the dog Mohammad or Jesus.,"I find it incomprehensible that such otherwise talented actors would associate themselves with such inane, tasteless material. That, however, is their choice. What I found distasteful enough to merit comment is the lack of respect shown Jewish people and total disregard for Jewish sensibilities. One can only imagine the reaction had the ""family"" ridiculed been Muslim. Had the dog been named Mohammad and been flushed down the toilet, Hollywood would have burned as Paris is now (6 Nov. 2005) and international, anti-American riots, such as those after the false report of a Koran being flushed down the toilet at Gitmo, would have broken out.

Hoffman and Streisland are funniest additions to recycled 'Fockers',"Meet the Fockers (2004) Robert De Niro, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, Barbra Streisand, Blythe DAnner, Teri Polo, Owen Wilson, D: Jay Roach.

Very funny in small doses, but this long, crude sequel tries desperately squeezing jokes out of the title's family's last name, embarrassing scenarios, and a randy dog, which feel repetitive after the six or seventh time they're reused.

We have to get out of this place. It is EVIL.,"Working in the business world, you are constantly told that by hitting your goal, you are just working to your average potential. If you exceed that goal, then you are surpassing your potential. Nearly everyday this is mentioned to me in some form or another, yet I wonder why it wouldn't apply to the business of Hollywood? The bar for Meet the Fockers was set, but for some strange reason, the actors only worked to their goal, and never exceeded it. Riding high off the hysterical Meet the Parents, I thought that this film would bring a new chapter into this ""original"" story, but instead director Jay Roach decided to stick with Hollywood standards and recycle the same jokes using different players. I don't know why I am so surprised, I witnessed this before when Roach directed the sequels to Austin Powers. The original film was inventive, original, and hysterical, while the other two films just seemed to recycle the same formula from that original film. The same could be seen in Meet the Fockers. From a similar plot structure, to undefined, clichéd characters, to a complete lack of humor, Meet the Fockers hit their goal, but chose not to exceed it in any way.For a comedy film, I felt this just didn't quite have the punch from the original film. While there were a couple of lines that I found myself chuckling at, there weren't any of those ""laugh-out-loud"" moments that I experienced with Meet the Parents. The actors who were in the original seemed bland and really just going through the motions, while the new elements (Streisand and Hoffman) seemed over the top, nearly tipping the structure all together. There was no balance. It was almost as if director Jay Roach was asking us to forget about DeNiro and Danner, and focus more on Streisand and Hoffman. We needed a stronger, more comedic balance in this family. While I do think that there was chemistry between these four players, it was never fully matched or developed. Their jokes also make for bad comedy. Have we not learned yet that bathroom humor is a thing of the past? There seemed to be more of these than the intelligent humor reached in Meet the Parents. Secondly, how many times can we hear the word ""Focker"" and laugh at it. I believe that it was overused in the first film, and deeply buried in this film. If these were the two anchoring jokes for the film, we are definitely on the wrong road of comedy. Roach had a very funny film on his hands here, but strangely, he focused on repeating similar jokes from the original, ultimately lowering this film from hysterical, to humorous.I mentioned above about how the actors were not reaching to their potential, and I do believe it to be true. DeNiro seemed bland throughout this entire film. There was no surprise or inviting element to him. Ben Stiller, literally, needs to take a break for a bit. His humor seems to be slowly fading with each film that he creates. He seems to jump head-first into the big budget films, when I really think that he could make a bigger impact on the smaller, independent pictures. Hoffman's character seemed forced. I could tell that he was having fun, in fact the whole cast was having fun, but no work was getting done. Hoffman had this one-dimensional character that only seemed alive because of Streisand's wacky shenanigans. Finally, there was the muted Teri Polo, whose character was so exciting that I nearly thought that she was dropped midway through this film. Again, I cannot state this enough, there was so much potential wasted in this film that I nearly imagined new ways to make this film as the film was still playing. Hoffman and DeNiro together should have created a match in comedy heaven, but instead ""ha-ha"" purgatory seemed more apt.Finally, I would like to say that nothing in this film surprised me. I kept waiting to get to the point in the movie where I would finally say, ""This is why this film was created"", but it never arrived. Roach hit the potential bar, but chose not to go above it. He knew he had enough money invested in it if he continued to use repetitive jokes and situations that creativity and originality was completely thrown out the window. It was sad to witness such greats fall, but I just wish there was more to this film  not in length, but in girth. Meet the Fockers is a perfect example of Hollywood creating just to meet budgets and create revenue. It was a formidable idea, but the finished product probably never reflected this idea. I was massively disappointed.Overall, there were some chuckles from me as I watched this film, but never any laughter. From the reviews and friends who spoke so highly of this film, I was expecting to be blown away by the possibility of a comedic sequel that worked, but perhaps I was setting the bar too high. Stiller does seem tired, as did the rest of the cast except for the newbies that never quite balanced out this picture. Everyone seemed so clichéd that you could literally pick out their characters from other comedy films from across the ages. A majority of the blame I bring on Roach's shoulders, as he needed to break his normal, tired, Hollywood recycled mold of film-making. I wasn't overly impressed with this film and would probably suggest skipping it. It carries none of the power, originality, or creative genius that Meet the Parents did.Grade: *** out of *****",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
There is not one joke in Meet the Fockers.,"There is notone joke in Meet the Fockers, the sequel to the horrible Meet the Parents (2000). Oh, there are references to dogs humping people's legs,vasectomies, circumcisions, toilets, small children repeating curse words,people getting injured and octogenarian sex, but nothing resembling thestructure, setup and payoff of an actual joke.Wallowing in the mire of this frat boy noise is an assembly of fine actors. Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner return as Jack and Dina, the right-wing parents of Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo), while Pam's fiancé Gaylord Focker (Ben Stiller) introduces the whole crew to his parents: sex therapist Roz (Barbra Streisand) and lawyer-turned-stay-at-home-dad Bernie (Dustin Hoffman).One set of parents is embarrassingly liberal and the other embarrassingly conservative. One thing the movie does well is to ridicule both sides equally, but that's about where it stops. Imagine what Preston Sturges could have done with this setup.During their careers, these actors have worked with the likes of Vincente Minnelli, William Wyler, Sam Peckinpah, Sergio Leone, Woody Allen, Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg. Now, here they are with Jay Roach, who directed the Austin Powers films, as well as the horrible Meet the Parents.Whereas Meet the Parents had one or two funny, organic moments that arose within the moment, this time Roach sticks to the script like rancid glue, allowing for not one second of life or improvisation. It even uses the old scene in which Greg makes an ass of himself in front of everyone, this time under the influence of a truth serum. Even Stiller looks bored and tired with this aging shtick.Of the film's high-class actors, only Streisand avoids embarrassment. She has sunk into her role -- her first screen appearance since 1996's The Mirror Has Two Faces -- in a way that lets her enjoy it. The other actors can barely hide their shame, but Streisand appears not to be too concerned about this outing. Her easy grace is the film's only selling point.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

Terrific Waste of Talent,"MEET THE FOCKERS is a family comedy in which two ill-matched couples meet over a weekend, argue and fight with each other, and then agree in the end to sanction the wedding of their children. A familiar plot, allowing plenty of opportunity for comic situations with a soupçon of sentiment. What is perhaps most remarkable about this film is the not only talent assembled - Robert de Niro, Barbra Streisand, Dustin Hoffman, Ben Stiller and Blythe Danner - but how director Jay Roach manages to waste it throughout the film's over-stretched 155-minute running time. Yes, it might be fun to watch de Niro hamming it up as a retired CIA officer with an obsession for surveillance; or witness Hoffman overact fearfully as a middle-aged man pretending to be young; or look at Stiller trying and failing to keep the two families on an even keel. But when the film ends up trying to get laughs out of a libidinous chihuahua chasing an aggressive cat, we sense the desperation running through it. The best part about it comes right at the end, when Owen Wilson turns in a cameo as Kevin Rawley, charged with the responsibility of marrying the (un)lucky couple; through eye-work alone he manages to raise more laughs than in the previous 110 or so minutes.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

Yes, it did have its funnier moments, and Dustin Hoffman lights up the picture, but as far as really cutting up a good laugh, I was disappointed.

"Meet the Fockers, but with reservations","The last(and only)time I saw 'Fockers' was six years ago on the big screen, and I was mildly disappointed. And what is Barbara Streisand doing in the movie?

'Fockers' is not quite at the level of 'Parents', but I enjoyed parts of it. What it boils down to is, this is a rehash of the original story. Again, we have a cat on the toilet, this time flushing himself. And I'm not so sure the term ""Meet the Fockers"", has quite the same ring as ""Meet the Parents"". Trust me, using the word 'parents' is more promising than a proper noun. So, if you haven't seen this one, and are expecting laughs equal to the first movie, don't get your hopes up too high.**1/2 out of ****",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Stunt Casting Can't Save Predictable Fockers,"This movie is a perfect rental. It's not that great and it's not un-watchable by any means. It's one of those films that is safe, cute, and you'd kick yourself in the heinie if you would've shelled out 9 bucks to see this. Basically, if you saw ""Meet the Parents"", then you've seen this one already without having to sit through it because it's essentially the same movie. Greg (Ben stiller) and Amy (Teri Polo) are engaged and after surviving the Byrnes family, it's now time to meet the Fockers.Greg's folks (Barbara Streisand and Dustin Hoffman) are eccentric, loving, extremely left winged liberals and they play it to such a hilt that it's almost cartoonish at times. The Byrnes, of course are led by ex-CIA psycho dad Robert Deniro who wants nothing but the best for his daughter and family. Naturally, the two families clash and the events in the film are comical at times, but also very predictable. DeNiro brings his cute grandson along for the trip and when Greg is asked to watch the baby, you just know the first word out of the kids mouth won't be ""mama"" or ""dada"".It's nice to see Hoffman and Barbra on screen together. It's obviously stunt casting, but it almost works. Streisand even has her 70's giant frizz hair that she parlayed in movies like ""Star Is Born"" and ""Main Event"". Hoffman is just a left winged weirdo at times that was a bit hard to take. I think better casting might have been Ben's real dad, Jerry Stiller and Estelle Harris (Seinfeld). That way you'd still have a bit of stunt casting with a more believable and nutty set of parents. Sort of a ""Meet the Costanzas"", if you will.This movie is cute, charming, and funny at times, but save this one for the video store. It's just not worth the price of admission.

PG-13? Really?,"Granted that a 13 year old young adult is considerably more knowledgeable than 10 years ago, the rating is rather loose.The filmmakers should have watched their first cut, then redid the first third of the picture. Not until then does the picture become somewhat believable. In the end, it's a touching story about trust, friendship, and what's important in a marriage.I almost stopped the picture, then my wife told me it got better. It did. It appears that the picture still suffers from overwork.

What a waste of time,"Perhaps the most poorly written movie in which legendary acting icons of Hoffman and DeNiro's caliber star. I don't know what these guys were thinking accepting this movie. Whatever happened to Jake LaMotta's and Rain men and Max Caddy's and Midnight Cowboys? How can these guys have become so desperate that they make a mockery of the career they spent decades building it.The rest of the cast, excluding Barbara Streisand which I still have respect for (because she's an awesome singer and not just an actor) demonstrate new possibilities in the highest levels of terrible acting. Not only the movie is not funny anymore, it's actually degrading on some levels. ""Dina Dina mobina..."" Is this supposed to be funny, or the writers were high when they were writing it.I have no respect for De Niro and Hoffman anymore. It's like you're a fan of these used-to-be-great icons and all of a sudden you're betrayed into learning that these guys have become so low that they rather star in the worst possible movies though with big payoffs than actually taking the time to devote their skills to a project that contributes in a positive way to the industry that helped make them. I hope to see better choices of acting from De Niro and Hoffman, because I still can't accept that they have totally lost their ability to give brilliant performances. Maybe I'm wrong, but the future will tell us.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Warrants deconstruction,"This is a movie that I instinctively avoided seeing. The name alone suggested problems. But since a couple of people I know went to see it in the theaters--and I was inclined to be judgmental--I thought I should take a look.In the early 70s Jean-Luc Godard made a movie in which Jane Fonda and Charles Aznavour play husband and wife. It was a sort of political movie. Soon after the movie was finished Jane Fonda made her infamous trip to Vietnam. After that trip Godard and his co-director for the movie with Fonda produced a one-hour film which consists of the two directors (we only heard their voices) analyzing a photo of Fonda in Vietnam that got published in French periodicals.I am not sure, but I think it was an example of what is called deconstruction. What seemed like an innocuous photo of a serious Jane Fonda listening to a Vietnamese person--turned out to be pregnant with meaning. They went on and on.I think the movie Meet the Fockers would be a good candidate for such deconstruction (if that is what Godard and friend were doing). I have noticed on several occasions that highly-regarded American actors and actresses allow themselves to participate in embarrassingly bad movies.There seems to be a sort of moral or cultural blind spot among Hollywood types that makes this possible.One thing that must be taken into account is that this movie was rated PG-13. It should be rated R, but then how many people would watch it? I can only assume that it is aimed at the adolescent audience. One possible mitigating factor in liking the movie could be youth. Things that seem trite when you have been around for a while might be entertaining when you are young--especially if you get pleasure out of naughtiness. But this movie cannot be naughty to an adult.You get the impression with some of these movies that they negotiated with the censors to the degree that one more swear word and it would have to be rated R. In other words, the idea is to get in as much objectionable material in as possible without a change of rating. It is also clear that what is now rated PG-13 would have been rated R not very many years ago. There are many R-rated movies I would rather have my children watch than this and other PG-13 movies.I think I have now been liberated from the 'two thumbs up' guide. Roeper gives the movie thumbs up and Ebert likes it more than he should, although he gives it thumbs down. So many good movies get made (e.g. Seagull's Laughter), such that someone's _recommending_ this movie is not a good sign.The style of acting bears some resemblance to a falsetto in singing.I said this movie warrants deconstruction. I have not done that here. I would be interested in reading a sophisticated critique of the movie. As a movie, it doesn't really warrant any critique at all. But as a symptom of something wrong with Hollywood, I think it might be quite instructive. Its problems are somewhat similar to those of Stuck on You--a British film.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Meet Your Reality ! (screen),"If you read a review for an objective truth, it is like asking for the moon....It's impossible...

sad indeed,"Had lesser talents been involved, ""Meet the Fockers"" would simply be another dumb comedy; the kind that relies on flushing dogs down toilets for laughs. However the talents involved happen to be Robert De Nero, Dustin Hoffman, Barbra Streisand and Blythe Danner, each having delivered indelible performances in their times. (If you an uncertain about Danner, check out ""Eccentricities of a Nightingale). After watching ""Meet the Fockers"" the paramount question that looms is what could have lured this bunch of luminaries to a movie like this.Well there's always money. No matter how rich people may be, big bucks are not easy to turn down. But more likely it's that almost desperate need to be in the limelight, to have a lead in a big movie. God knows Hollywood has not much to offer folk their age. Actors of their vast experience must surely know crap when they read a script. Did their prodigious egos convince themselves that they could make it work ? This is nothing new for De Nero. A while back he relinquished any attempt at a serious film career. That is not to say that actors of his class should not do comedy. (He was wonderful in ""Midnight Run"".) Hoffman seems for the most part like he's having fun. Streisand however, seems tense and forced in most of her scenes. It's very much a case of ""what was she thinking"". She who had a reputation for being so picky about her roles, returns to the screen after eight years to play an appallingly written, stereotypical overbearing Jewish mother.Sad indeed.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good Performances In A Weak Sequel,"""Meet The Parents"" was a good movie - funny and interesting. Essentially what made it funny and interesting was the relationship between Jack (Robert de Niro) and Greg (Ben Stiller.) Jack was enough of a unique character that he was quite funny. The problem with this movie was that there was nothing unique in it.The premise seemed good enough. In the first movie we're introduced to Pam's parents; now we're going to meet Greg's. Played by Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand it seemed that they would be perfect complements to De Niro. But they ended up being cast as refugees from the 60's. Yes, they were quite a contrast to CIA agent Jack but the whole ""refugees from the 60's"" thing has been overdone in my opinion.I just didn't find this movie especially funny, and what I think was supposed to be the climax of the movie, after Jack injected Greg with sodium pentathol to get ""the truth"" out of him seemed to me unpleasant and completely unfunny. De Niro's good; Stiller's good; Streisand's good; Hoffman's good. In fact, of the major stars the only one who I thought didn't quite pull it off was Teri Polo as Pam. But for all the good performances, this movie just didn't catch me. I just didn't care for it, which is why I give it a 3.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
An Okay Sequel,"A sequel to ""Meet the Parents"" was teased in the final moments of the first film and it somewhat delivers. The characters from the first movie return in full force with Greg and Jack's relationship in a good place, but not too steady. Throw in Greg's parents, played excellently by Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand and the tension is at an all time high.There are some genuinely funny moments in this movie, but it is much more crass than the first. For some reason, there are a lot of weird, nude items scattered throughout the film.Ultimately, this is a fine sequel but it does not hold a candle to the first film.Best Character: Roz

"It's not bad, but it's hardly brilliant either","This redundant and superfluous sequel to 2000's Meet the Parents is an enjoyable, if not overly brilliant, piece of fluff. Of course, cinema could have done without this production, but since it's been made and I enjoyed the first one, I figured I'd enjoy this one too. However, simply put; this film isn't as good as the original because it's gone way over the top with it's quirky characters and instead of being something of a muddled commentary on in-laws like the first one; this is more of a film where a load of incompatible characters have been thrown into a mixing pot together. This isn't all bad however, as it does make for some nice entertainment and it also allows room for some nice jokes. While the film doesn't offer anything in the way of intelligent humour that you'll remember for a while after the final credits, it does supply the audience with nice set piece gags that are very funny at the time of watching. My personal favourite of the set-pieces involves Ben Stiller, a baby and...Scarface.Robert De Niro has been getting lots of stick lately due to the fact that, with the exception of his relatively small role in Jackie Brown, he hasn't been in a really good film since 1993's A Bronx Tale and This Boy's Life. However, his performances haven't diminished and even though the material he has to work with here isn't exactly of the highest standard, he still makes the best of the role and is easily the highlight of the movie. Returning from the original is Ben Stiller, who does just fine as the eager-to-please son-in-law, and the rather incognito Teri Polo and Blythe Danner, who don't really get to do much. Joining them is the duo of Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streishand, who play Stiller's parents; the 'amusingly' titled ""Fockers"". The material for them is weak, but they both look like they're having fun, and a few of their gags are funny. On the whole; this movie will be remembered more for it's name than it's hilarious gags, but if you find yourself with nothing better to do than watch this movie...well, it's better than nothing.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Gaylord,"This movie isn't great, not as good as the first, in fact I don't think the first movie really warranted a sequel... and it's a trilogy so....
The story is messy and it is not as clever as the first one. I also don't think the story is as relatable as the first movie... I mean does this ever really happen? It's known that meeting your significant others parents is not so fun, which is the scenario the first movie played with, and exaggerated. But when is it ever important for the two families to meet? So much as to like each other?
I don't know maybe I don't know... but I don't think that's a real thing. So this movie isn't quite as relatable, as its not pulling off a real world struggle.I will say that Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand we're actually very funny.

Forced Comedy with Good Performances and please:  No more puns on the word Focker.,"This movie played as if the writers were making the story up as they went along, at times using ideas copied from the original. A few of the jokes worked but generally I found the movie boring and was anxious for it to end. The veteran actors turned in good performances but even they seemed bored with the whole idea. The freshest performance was by the baby, who tended to steal the show. Many movies start off with a bang and end with a whimper.

Nah,"I mean, the one scene I remember everyone quoting back in primary school - going back nearly two decades - is still kind of funny in context, even if they run it into the ground (baby swearing). And I think casting Dustin Hoffman as Ben Stiller's father is a surprisingly good choice; I can kind of see it. But then everything else is pretty lazy and underwhelming at best. Too many eccentric characters kind of undoes the stuff that can be funny, and I do remember there being enough of a balance with Meet the Parents that it generally worked. This sequel, on the other hand, is representative of these early to mid-2000s Hollywood comedies just coasting by and doing very little to actually provoke laughs. I don't think it's a nadir for this style of comedy film, but it's also not particularly good.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
People are way to easy on this movie.,"The most surprising thing about this movie was that I actually liked Barbara Streisand in it, and I figured my tendencies would reject her on principle.

Remember that really funny moment in Meet the Parents? Here's a reminder of that joke because we couldn't make new ones for this movie."" I usually don't like to go on rants about ""what's wrong with Hollywood"" but rest assured if there is something wrong with Hollywood, this is it. Austin Powers 2 was a big romp through past jokes, but somehow that still came off fresh and funny. This movie is more recycled than the only towel at pie-eating contest. Dustin Hoffman's performance was very generic and he definitely phoned this one in.

Missed opportunity,"When you have a cast which includes three persons who have won Oscars for acting and one who has won a Tony for acting, the result should be much, much better than this. The choice of Streisand and Hoffman as the elder Fockers was inspired, and it is a shame that the script and direction did not exhibit similar inspiration.The problem, in my opinion, was that the set-up evolved into a La Cage Aux Folles idea: to hide one's parents from one's prospective in-laws. It would have been wonderful to allow Blythe Danner to do something more than merely to tut-tut at Robert De Niro, or to allow De Niro to do something more than make faces, or to let Streisand put De Niro in his place.The film was amiable, with a few good jokes, some of which went on a bit too long.

Whole bits from the original are reused here, but they're not as funny the second time around. The novelty here is having Hoffman and DeNiro appear together -- and for the most ardent movie buffs, they will spot Pacino in a very brief scene.

A waste of your time and their talent,"... but then maybe you'd rather not since this is largely a mediocre movie and you may wonder why Streisand and Hoffman agreed to appear in it, even if Hoffman almost makes it worth watching.

Consequently, it's a lazy movie and a waste of the considerable talents involved. The original was no great shakes, (DeNiro is far from being a natural comic talent), but it passed the time amiably enough and had a couple of good visual gags. Here, in the absence of anything substantially original, the same jokes are basically retold but are a lot less funny the second time around. One to miss, I'm afraid.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

I don't know if it was due to bad writing or just lack of effort. Stiller's character Gaylord Focker had his moments but was to busy trying to stay within ""the circle of trust"". Deniro was horrible as Jack Byrnes and Teri Polo's character Pam Byrnes left me with nothing good to say.""Meet the Fockers"" dealt with so many good issues but hardly dedicated any time for any of them to develop into something entertaining.

Second time not so funny,"Meet the Fockers is the sequel to the wildly popular film made in 2000, Meet the Parents. The sequel includes much of the same cast, as Ben Stiller reprises his role of male nurse, Gaylord ""Greg"" Focker, and Robert DeNiro once again plays the straight laced, former CIA agent and father-in-law, Jack Byrnes. The premise of the sequel is that after winning over the in-laws, Stiller now has to go through the painful process of introducing his fiancée's family to his own parents, played by Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand. The conservative, buttoned-up Byrnes family plays the perfect apple to the orange of Hoffman's and Streisand's over tanned, over sexed past-their-prime hippies. Unfortunately, this is about as far as the humor goes.There are plenty of chuckles to be had as the site gags, physical humor and misunderstandings run rampant. But that same humor that seemed fresh, light and honest in Parents, seems contrived, tired and played out in Fockers. As is prone to happen in a sequel, jokes that worked in the first movie were seemingly regurgitated to fit the new story line. DeNiro's ""interrogation"" of future son-in-law Stiller seemed clever in the original but more like a cliché in the sequel. Likewise, the jokes about being a male nurse and the humor found in the different ways to pronounce Focker just don't seem the same the second time around.It's kind of like when a child learns to talk. You expect a baby to well, talk like a baby; and it's cute. But when that child is five and still talking like a baby, it's not that cute anymore. In fact, it's kind of annoying; much like this movie.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Crude and Nasty Jokes,"I loved Meet the Parents. That will always be placed in my top 10 favorite comedy movies, ever. The reason why that movie is placed as one of my favorite comedy films of all time is that the jokes are so simple and so easily understood, it was enjoyable, even for the family. I've watched the movie many times and never put it down since. I believe Meet the Parents was where I first believe Ben Stiller to be my favorite comedy actor. From there, I've seen dozens of outstanding movies by him, particularly Zoolander. And here came Meet the Fockers, the supposed sequel of the delightful, mild comedy of Meet the Parents. That had to end right there.Meet the Fockers was beyond the simplistic jokes of Meet the Parents. Sure, it did have an outstanding cast, including Barbara Streisand and Dustin Hoffman as an addition to the original cast, but the jokes were just too much, that it didn't feel like a Meet the Parents-like movie anymore. The jokes were mostly sexual and crude, and were meant for one laugh rather than most. Making some of the most ridiculous jokes ever, I couldn't bear watching the movie. The progress of the film was also cliché. It was the same exact thing as Meet the Parents, but with a new height in its jokes.

More of Owen Wilson would have made this movie more humorous, he is a very funny actor. Teri Polo looked strained in the role. As a couple with Stiller, they seemed as boring as people who had been married years, not newly engaged.

Nevertheless, it is extremely funny, but I would advise you to be careful if you see this film with kids, especially kids that laugh at immature topics, e.g farts.

I do recommend you watch the fist film though. Enjoy!",,Anonymous,Romance
Better than the first,"I really think this movie was better than the first. Why? it had a lot of reasons why Dustin and Barbra were in it, but the main reason because I thought this story was more entertaining and the plot was better than the first. If I would rate the first I had rate it:7/10, this one I rate 7.5/10 a little better. It was very fun to see Dustin Hoffman and Robert De Niro in the same movie, AGAIN!(wag the dog). The only thing I find more worse than the first is that meet the fockers is more embarrassing. And I Don't like stuffs like, when Gaylord went up on the Stage and said lots of embarrassing stuff, I couldn't watch that part. hahaha. But this movie is very underrated! This movie hasn't a lot of big laughs like meet the parents, but it got MORE laughs than the first and for me that makes this comedy better!Haffe",,Anonymous,Romance
Watchable but mediocre follow up to 'Meet The Parents',This is a mediocre follow up to 'Meet The Parents'. The jokes appear in fits and starts despite the presence of an all star cast. The script is weak. It feels like a retread of the first film. Several incidents are repeated and the energy level sags at times. It is fun though to see Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman playing a married couple. They clearly improvised many of their lines.The film milks some laughs from the liberal-conservative divide between the Focker and the Byrnes families. Robert De Niro isn't as funny this time round. The climax is weak and may put off some viewers.Overall 4/10,,Anonymous,Romance
the critics seem to be missing something in their otherwise entirely accurate reviews,"I've read a number of reviews--over a dozen--of this flick, and I've yet to come across a single one that mentions the sheer ineptitude of the filmmakers, namely the fact that various microphones show up in over forty shots in the film. FORTY SHOTS! What I don't understand is that critics seem to be politely ignoring this, rather than doing their jobs and, well, criticizing it. I mean, forty shots. All tepid and lowest-common-denominator comedy aside, this is Ed Wood caliber, folks. The fact that this movie is garnering such big bucks at the box office, so riddled with sophomoric and unapologetic blunders, speaks very lowly of the average American moviegoer's appetite for junk. I teach composition courses. Were a student to hand over a paper so filled with punctuation errors, grammatical flaws, and bad spelling that it wasn't readable, I'd have to say, ""Here, do it over, and do it better. It's unacceptable this way."" That's what MEET THE FOCKERS is: bad movie grammar. Nothing ruins the silver-screen illusion (or a tasteless joke about strap-on breasts, foreskin, or foul-mouthed babies) like a big black metal rod thrusting in DeNiro's mug. Where do we go from here? I'd like to say, only up, but....",,Anonymous,Romance
What a surprise!,"I saw this film the other day and I must say I was pleasantly surprised by the performance of Streisand. Usually she over-dominates a film but here she is quite prepared to share the limelight with all the other actors. And not one person remarks that she is really beautiful! Even her legs and fingernails were less in evidence. Both she and Dustin Hoffman (who doesn't show enough of his comic talents) were hilarious as a couple who're still living in the 1970s.I must say, though, I was disappointed in the performances of the other two actors, Robert de Niro and Blythe Danner. The latter was wasted and not given enough to do, and the former looks too grim and determined to have a lighter side. And how come their grandson still needs breastfeeding when he's clearly shown to have quite a few teeth? I'm not a mother but know perfectly well that infants are weaned after a few months. The whole storyline of the fake breast was dumb, to say the least.",,Anonymous,Romance
Dustin Hoffman Exceeds Even Barbara Streisand,"I still have unpleasant memories from the 60's / 70's of sitting miserably through Streisand movies such as ""Owl and PussyCat"" ""Funny Lady"" ""Hello Dolly"" etc. (not by choice, my girlfriend dragged me in). I thought Babs was the most tiresome, irritating moron in the entire entertainment universe; don't even get me started on her singing (mercifully, at that time I hadn't yet heard of Bette Midler or Joan Rivers). But in ""Meet the Fockers"" Dustin Hoffman has actually achieved the impossible - he is even more irritating than Barbara Streisand! I think I could have endured the ordeal better without dialog; if only I could have plugged in headphones and drowned out the film soundtrack with the soothing sound of fingernails scraping on a chalkboard. Alas I had to listen to Hoffman being an obnoxious jerk, it seemed like every time he opened his mouth he had another brain-fart. Humor is at its best when it is subtle enough to imitate life; nobody in real life would behave like Hoffman's character and live to reach the age of 50, some irate relative would have bashed in his skull with a piece of 2 x 4.",,Anonymous,Romance
Another belated and very average sequel to a very good original film,"STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsAfter going through the ordeal of his fiancé's father Jack (Robert De Niro) in the first film five years ago,the unfortunately named male nurse Gaylord Focker (Ben Stiller) is ready for the big day with said fiancé Pam (Teri Polo) to tie the knot.However,Pam's parents have yet to get acquainted with Gaylord's folks-the far more permissive,liberal, laid back Bernie (Dustin Hoffman) and Roz (Barbara Striesand).Their unusual and embarrassing traits are soon causing chaotic,comedic mishaps left,right and centre...When I think of films like this,I can't help but get that song into my head that goes like:'one way,or another,I'm gonna feel ya,I'm gonna getcha getcha getcha getcha...'It doesn't matter if you have to wait five years,seven years,even ten years!,films as successful (and rightfully so!) as the original Meet the Parents are just destined for sequels sooner or later by studio execs desperate to rake in extra bucks off the originals popularity.But,almost always,they nowhere near manage to capture the fineness of the originals.Which (as usual,to be honest) is the case here...I remember I laughed quite heartily once or twice but for the most part,this has a dry,ineffective script that misses the laughter nerve with most of the gags it was aiming for.Add to that the fact that it feels really overlong and overdrawn and the tasteless,off-putting smutty sex interludes between the older cast members,and,well...Yes,like Fortress 2,Bad Boys 2,Men in Black 2,X-Men 2 and pretty much every sequel before it,Meet the Fockers,for the most part,doesn't even manage to be a paling shadow of it's predecessor.Oh well,if they've all met each other,I don't suppose we'll be seeing any more follow-ups now,will we?**",,Anonymous,Romance
Third sequel?,"I don't know if this is true or not, but I was watching Fox News last week and I only caught the tail end of this, but supposively there is going to be a third sequel to ""Meet The Parents"". Is this true? Has anyone else heard about this, and if so, what will it be about? I think it would be neat to see Greg and Pam married with a new baby on the way. I can only imagine what that would be like.Another thing, in the original movie, Greg says he grew up in Detroit, yet when the Byrnes' go to meet his parents, they are living in Florida. I would assume they may have moved there to enjoy retirement, but then we see Greg's nanny in Florida too, which means he must have grown up there. I'm confused...could Greg have lied in the first movie and said he grew up in Detroit when he really grew up in Florida? Any ideas?",,Anonymous,Romance
Funny sequel!,"Meet the Fockers/2004/*** Main Stars:Ben StillerDustin HoffmanBarbara SteisandRobert DeNiro There is one word I'll have to call this movie- ""odd"". The Focker parents are the odd ones in this movie. As you know from the previews, the Fockers meet up with Ben Stiller's character's wife's parents. The crazy Focker parents don't really care what they do in the public because they are very odd. This movie may be odd, but it also has some funny moments. Meet the Parents was a funny movie also and I'd say both Meet the Parents and Meet the Fockers were the same in rating. This was the usual ""Meet the Parents"" type movie. I'd say the oddest character in this movie was Bernard Focker (Dustin Hoffman) and the character that messes up everything is definitely Gaylord Focker (Ben Stiller). And, of course, I'd say the smartest character in this movie is Robert DeNiro's character. You might think (from the previews) it looks stupid but it is actually quite funny. If you want to see something about crazy, bumbling, and smart people, then this is the movie for you. Movie directed by Jay Roach.",,Anonymous,Romance
