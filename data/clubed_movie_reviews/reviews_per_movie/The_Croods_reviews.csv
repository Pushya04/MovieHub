Slapstick Heavy Family Fun,"From DreamWorks studios comes its latest animated adventure, the prehistoric family comedy The Croods. It is a slapstick-heavy family movie that should delight young children and keep parents entertained.The Croods are the last remaining family in an arid desert landscape. They have survived by following family patriarch Grug's (Nicolas Cage) rules to the letter, including staying in the cave after dark and fearing anything that seems new (new is BAAAD). Despite this, teenage daughter Eep (Emma Stone) wants to break free and rebels against her father, which results in a chance meeting with the highly inventive Guy (Ryan Reynolds), who warns her that the end of the world is nigh. When the Croods' cave is destroyed, the family is forced on a journey into a strange new world where Grug's rules clash with Guy's techniques for survival.The Croods is a formulaic movie that sticks to a traditional hero's journey and relies on typical archetypes, but it's elevated by the writing and direction of Kirk DeMicco and How to Train Your Dragon's Chris Sanders. Like Sanders' previous work, The Croods focuses on a family's dynamic and relationships. This time, the focus is on a protective father who wants to protect his family physically and protect his daughter from a member of the opposite sex who suddenly challenges his position as the alpha male. While the trailers and first half of the movie made is seem Eep was the main character, it's actually Grug who goes through the greatest change and learns the biggest lessons.The story is one about learning, exploring, and using one's intelligence. It also touches on the idea that it's unhealthy to live a sheltered life. But at times, the movie lays it on a bit too much with Guy and his ""solutions"" leaving Grug on the losing end.Most of the humour used in The Croods is very physical and slapstick oriented. Characters have Loony Toons levels of invincibility as they endure intense physical pain. This type of humour obviously appeals to fairly young children, but I would be lying if I said I did not laugh at the film at all. The Croods avoids using crude toilet humour to generate cheap laughs. There is not much in the way of verbal humour, but there are some running gags, and modernisms are kept to a minimum. They are still there but they are more putting modern products in a Stone Age setting, a little like The Flintstones, so they serve more as pop-cultural winks to adults.As expected from a DreamsWork movie the animation is fantastic. It's quick and fluid, and the camera flows nicely as it follows the action. The Croods themselves have a seemingly unpleasant, bulky design to them but it actually works in the context of the film because the characters live in the wild, so big and broad makes sense. It is a little refreshing to see the main female character is not made out to be a stunning beauty, but rather someone who has been shaped by her environment. The beginning of the movie starts with in dry, mono-coloured landscapes before we get to see the bright colours of the jungle and continually seeing the weird creature reminiscence of designs of Sanders' previous works.Like other animated movies these days, The Croods has a big name voice cast and they also do a decent, if standard job. No one disgraces themselves. Cage is an unusual choice, but he gives a strong performance. There is only one time when Cage is let off the handle; Unfortunately, that is when we are experiencing the most modernism the movie has to offer.The Croods is not going to match the heights of DreamsWorks major hits of Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, and How to Train Your Dragon. But it certainly does not belong with the dregs the studio has to offer. It does what it sets out to do: make a movie that will please children while attempting to give a positive message and some heart. It has an old-fashioned sense of humour that leads to a surprisingly enjoyable animated movie.Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

The Old and the New,"The Neanderthal family the Croods lives in a cave, protected by the father Grug in accordance with the rules of survival that he has learned. His teenage daughter Eep is rebel and questions why the family lives in the dark. One night, Eep sees light and she finds the Homosapiens Guy that can control fire and is intelligent and tells that their world will end. When their cave collapses, Eep seeks out Guy to follow him to the new world. But the stubborn Grug does not accept the change of rules and wants to find another cave to protect his family.""The Croods"" is a funny animation with the eternal theme of acceptance of what is new. Grug is a good caveman that based on the experience of his former neighbors, believes that he can protect his family locking them inside a cave. When he meets Guy with new ideas, there is a hilarious friction and competition. But the conclusion is well resolved and his family aggregates a new member and several pets. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Os Croods"" (""The Croods"")",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Joyous fun,"In my life as a parent of a 10 and 12 year old, I have been to see a lot of animated kids movies, some of them quite painful to sit through. This one ranks at the top. The action, the humor, the characters, the plot, all rolled up in to a big ball of fun. I was belly laughing with my kids the whole way through it. And the message is lovely to boot. Excellent casting...the chemistry between the characters stood out in a way I never thought a cartoon could, no doubt due to the talent of the actors and standout animation (not something that I'm usually all that dazzled by.) It was the interaction, along with thoughtful humor of what is important in life, that really put this over the top for me. The complete implausibility of the plot didn't even mildly annoy me, the way stories of this genre sometimes do.I could actually stand to watch this a second time. Well done Hollywood, please put this level of thought in to more children's movies.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Zany Ideas,"The Croods seems like it's gonna be just another Dreamworks Animated film that has crazy little characters messing around with their antics on a preposterous world. Well, these kinds of films are remarkably fun and has impressive technical achievements but there's nothing else to merit in the end. The Crood is almost one of those simple crazy films if not because of the philosophy that was displayed on the premise. Basically, it's about a zany version of the prehistoric times and a survival on the continental drift. The conflict of this plot is the titular family's choices if they would choose to follow their overprotective father or a stranger who makes daring ideas to survive from the natural condition. Disappointingly, the conclusion goes to the easy way. It doesn't go beyond the comfort zone, but the visuals transcend. The animation is getting better and better. It's totally fun but there are things that could have been more complex.Everything is ought to be silly and hilarious. The beginning gives a set of ridiculous sequences to easily get to know about these characters. When it finally proceeds to the actual plot, it tells something sophisticated. It's an opposition between safety and getting away from your comfort zone. It ends up being obvious when it is suppose to be complex. But that is what the film wants, be simple and delightful all the way. The film doesn't necessarily need to be deep or emotional, but there is something clever to its concept that could have been smarter.The best thing about the film is the characters. The performances simply brought them to life. Emma Stone perfectly gives her role a fitting personality. It sounds perfect for Nicolas Cage to play a caveman. He yells at a monkey in one scene which is a usual pleasure from him, but there is more to the Grug character than just yelling. While Cage is having fun, he brings a strong emotional depth to the rest of his scenes. The characters of Clark Duke and Cloris Leachman provide most of the laughs and they effectively show off its joy.The visual effects are even more spectacular than the rest of the studio's films. Just like their recent films, it's snappy and energetic. The film's world looks amazingly eye candy and imaginative. The prehistoric characters and animals are wonderfully designed. The animal designs are meant to be ironic, like some of them got their food chain reversed eventually or their hybrid will some day become their fear. It's a slick joke. And for the 3D, you know it's great as long as it's from Dreamworks Animation.It leaves a great amount of heart and fun, but its enlightenment theme results as being underwhelming and somewhat contrived. It would have made this more than just a typical Dreamworks film, but it doesn't matter because the movie is definitely suppose to be delightful for the entire family. It still takes some clever points. It's also great to see a load of spectacular animation. It is indeed truly enjoyable and full of life. The Croods is far from classic but this is kind of film that would enjoy anytime.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
VERY funny -- a very pleasant surprise!,"I was talked into seeing this, and I have to shout it out, because it is a RIOT! I don't write many reviews, but when I love a film, I have to. If I have any complaint on this one, it's the title. I expected gross-out humor (""crude""). There isn't any, really. It's actually extremely unpredictable, subtle and extremely smart humor.It has a story arc that you begin to somewhat anticipate, but you don't feel you're being patronized. Instead, you're left feeling that very intelligent people put this thing together in hopes that everyone would find something to love about it.The cast is great, the animation is fun, and it's non-dizzying 3-D.When I saw it, the entire audience clapped at the end, because we were entertained throughout, and found the ending really satisfying.What else? Sweet emotions crop up because we can all relate to the family dynamics. Every family has the screw-up, the salt of the earth, the rebel, and the stubborn one. And it has one of the funniest babies ever put on film. A baby unlike any baby you'll ever see anywhere.Very, very funny. Definitely recommend.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Excellent movie for the whole family to enjoy!,"I saw this movie at a sneak preview this afternoon. This was a very enjoyable movie for our whole family. Me and my husband sat there and laughed frequently, being completely enthralled with the story and graphics. Meanwhile, my daughter and my 7 year-old grandson sat with us, and they also were laughing throughout most of the movie. It has something for people of all ages to enjoy. It was heartwarming, and at times, it totally pulls on your heartstrings, too. The characters were appealing, and the type you find yourself rooting for as time goes by, and the animals that interact with the humans frequently stole the show! I know that some critics will have issues with some of the fantastic creatures that are seen, and they may take issue with the extraordinary things that The Croods are able to do physically. I knew going into this movie that this movie was a work of fiction, though, and therefore I was able to suspend my expectations of reality, and go on the ride that Dreamworks wanted to take me on. I thoroughly enjoyed myself, and took this movie for what it was - a lighthearted comedy about a family going through changes, and how they deal with those changes. I would definitely recommend this as a great movie to see!!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great family entertainer with awesome 3D effects,This movie is very entertaining for viewers of all age groups. 3D effects are awesome. Kids will love it and so will parents.Some scenes may remind of the beauty of Pandora in Avatar. Overall a great movie that will make you laugh and make you fall in love with characters.The animals are out of the world and scenes are very colorful. Its a story of survival in midst of danger. It shows the emotions and challenges that families face today in cave man's life.The movie shows the life of prehistoric humans. The movie also sheds light on relationships and bonds in family ties.,7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Behold... A Prehistoric Age Where Humans Still Live... Apparently For Now!,"The Croods, a name most bizarre to be given as a title of a movie, but the content, just fantastic! I may even add to say that Dreamworks has lived up to its expectations in delivering exceptionally amazing animated movies and their latest release, The Croods is no exception. The story begins by introducing us to a rather diverse family of a couple, their three children and an old grandmother(who just wouldn't die) and setting is a prehistoric age where they are supposedly the only living humans. The movie then goes on to bring an extra character just named ""Guy"" and his sidekick Belt(an animal) who goes on to proclaim that the end of the world is near and their only hope for survival was to aim for the mountains far ahead. A simple plot it seems no doubt, but the way the movie was crafted was just fantastic and if that wasn't enough, you might actually find yourself laughing a couple of times no matter what age you might be of. There might be many movies out there to be watched but ""The Croods"" is a film which is guaranteed to be enjoyed. It might not be the best film out there, but it certainly is a great one which has its own comedic and adventurous moments, a movie for the whole family out there and to all those who prefer watching it in 3-D, the effects are seriously good in this film and your choice would be a valid one. All in all, no matter what age you may be, ""The Croods"" might just bring back a smile or a few memories of those old childhood fantasies where anything was possible.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"For the whole family, entertaining","A prehistoric adventure full of beautiful animated landscapes and constant laugh that makes it perfect for the whole family.The publicity of this movie makes you think that the main character is Eep (Emma Stone), but actually her father Grug (Nicolas Cage), is also a main character. The plot of the story go around this two, everything one of them do affects the other to the point that at a time Grug is more a protagonist than Eep. The fact that this is so makes a different approach on certain themes, like that the message is more for adult parents than for the young audience, which is odd on animated movies.Of course, the story is not complicated and either deep, but Dreamworks is not known for making that kind of movies. It doesn't have anything special either, except for the final approach to adults than to kids. But it is fun, full of physic and verbal jokes, which keep the audience laughing all the time. Regularly I wouldn't say that physical jokes (like punching), are well used and effective, but in this case we are talking about cavemen, brutal force is suppose to be the principal characteristic. So in this movie all the ""punch to laugh"" is justified and proper to the setting.The dynamic between the members of the family is very close to a reality. None of us need to go out hunting to survive, but we often fight with our relative. Imagine that you are in a trip with your whole family. Well, all the talking, arguing and everything that drive you crazy about the guy next to you is in this movie. So there are plenty of elements that make this family of the Stone Age similar to modern families. Like the fact that you can fight all you want with your mom, dad, brother or grandma, but in the end you will protect them and give everything for them.The world where this movie takes place is beautiful and unique. All the things that you encounter aren't real, the animals, the plants, everything has been invented by the creators with references of real creatures. That puts you in the same spot that the Croods. As they will discover new creatures and explore new worlds, the audience will know the world too. So the audience can't muck of the fact that the Croods don't know what kind of animals live on the earth, because they don't know either what are the species living on that world.This is a good movie to go and enjoy with the whole family. Kids will love the graphics, the colors, some of them the 3D, and the jokes. Adults will laugh too with the jokes and will have a nice time with the ones they love.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
All around great family movie,"I have to say this movie is worth a watch for whatever age you are. It will be fun for the younger ones and even older adults. Basically this movie revolves around the age old debate of how to live your life, in fear cautiously(in the dark ie:the cave) or freely with courage (towards the light)?. Basically it may seem the girl EEP is the main character who basically wants to 'leave the cave' and become independent. But it shifts towards the end focusing on Grug who learns to break out his shell and fulfill his desired role better ,as the masculine protector of his family.As it can be seen there are some interesting character development and relatable issues at hand. Nonetheless the Croods manage to blend this perfectly with a humorous and compelling adventure.I had quite a few laughs, it is a special movie and one I would recommended movie enthusiasts to purchase.",,Anonymous,Animation
This was a awful movie,"Predictable, unimaginative, boring, and just dumb. It was very difficult to sit through this film, and even the kids hated it. High production values and good 3D animation don't count for anything with a story as dull as this one.There are a lot of 'jokes' in the movie that feel like they came out of one of those 1970s Hannah-Babara cartoons.The ""action"" sequences—and there are many of them—are long, loud, and still very dull because they are entirely predictable, even down to the final, predictable and forced 'joke' at the end. One follows upon the other with a very thin sheen of story to connect them.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
Funniest Kid's film so far this year,"'The Croods' is DreamWorks' latest animated production. It involves a family of cavemen as they are forced to venture out into the open after their cave is destroyed.The story is quite well written; it starts with you thinking it is going to revolve around teenage girl Eep (Emma Stone), with her journey, falling in love blah blah blah. However, the story develops into one about how sometimes fathers have to learn lessons and acknowledge that they can be wrong about things. Although it is only a voice performance, Nicholas Cage is brilliant and provides 90% of the comedy here. You can tell he had a great time working on this film. As children's films go, this is probably the funniest one in a while, the story is not insultingly basic and it teaches some decent life lessons along the way. The only thing that really bugged me was the Belt character – I didn't get what was so funny about a small creature shouting 'dundunduuuuun!' at various moments throughout the film in scenes where it didn't really fit. It seems to be a necessity in children's films now to have a little sidekick randomly make a funny noise of come out with some naff pop culture reference these days.Overall, the film is probably the best kid's film out so far this year. There are a lot of really funny scenes and a couple of tear-jerking moments too.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Cavemen to Hunter/Gatherers Now Makes Sense,"I took my 3 yr old Grandson and he sat on the edge of his seat the whole movie. We tried catching fire and flowers and once got hit in the face by a bird. The 3d seems to be on a new level of excellence. I'm a teacher and I totally now understand what scientists mean from cavemen to hunterers/gatherers and I think it will help children see it too and introduce them to tar pits, saber tooth tigers, earthquakes, and a lot of science stuff. The story was great, the characters were realistic to a family, and although sometimes the dad didn't get any respect, in the end it was apparent his love for his family and theirs for him. I highly recommend this to adults and children.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Beautiful on so many levels,"Take a child to see this beautifully made, thoughtful, animated feature. I went by myself, but the theater was full of children, and their laughter at the myriad slapstick humor added so much to the experience. Which is better;staying safe or taking risks? This is the premise of ""The Croods"" as the Crood family and Guy, a newcomer, experience tectonic plate shifts and other violent geologic events together. Interspersed with these big changes, though, are Eden-like ecosystems where the colors are vibrant and inviting. Emma Stone, Nicholas Cage, and Ryan Reynolds are perfectly cast. I will be buying this movie when it comes to DVD.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Loved it!!!,"I have never written a review on a movie before no matter how good or bad. But this movie really deserves high praise! I had brought the kids to see a few other animated movies before this like Wreck-it Ralph and Rise of the Guardian, but they turned out to be somewhat boring and unengaged. So I went into this not expecting much, it was more for the kids. To my surprise, I LOVED IT! It's different, funny, smart, and adventurous. I found myself giggling through most of the movies and at other times astounded by the visual effects. I also see my kids and other kids sitting at the edge of their seats at times. It is great for all ages. The picture was stunning and saturated with imagination. Dreamworks has outdone themselves with this one. I highly recommend taking your family to see this!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Saw it, loved it, nuff said.","I was of course hoping that Dreamworks would have a hit here after the unfortunate demise of Rise of the Guardians (I actually enjoyed the first ROTG book but couldn't get through the second book) which killed that franchise. I saw The Croods on opening day at a matinée and I loved it. I laughed, I cried (yes, just a bit) and I had so much fun that I didn't want it to end (Dun Dun Daaaaa). I've been reading the early message boards and prior mixed buzz so I was a little worried here and it's unfortunate that folks are so quick to try and tear something down based on a trailer or someone else's opinion. Go see it for yourself and have fun! I give this 10 big stars and can't wait to add it to my collection. My only regret is that I went to the first showing rather than wait for the 3D screening. I'm a little jealous by some of the great 3D comments. Even in 2D, the animators create a wonderful world, make us feel good and really get us excited to get out and have an adventure.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Imaginative portrayal of the prehistoric world,"This film goes all-out with its imaginative setting and shows lots of fantastical creatures. This is a strength of the film but it also means that it doesn't really have anything to do with the prehistoric world at all. The whole time I just imagined that it was set in some post-apocalyptic wasteland where humans have engineered the entire ecology of Earth as weapons, which made it more fun to watch. The family dynamic was entertaining and there is a good message about being open-minded.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great colourful fun from Dreamworks,"Dreamworks have been hit and miss for me(mostly hits), while I love The Prince of Egypt and How to Train Your Dragon, Shark Tale and Bee Movie left me underwhelmed. Watching the trailer for The Croods, admittedly I wasn't entirely impressed. But as I love animation so much and because I believe in giving any film a chance, I went ahead and watched The Croods anyway. And it was much better than anticipated and what the trailer made it out to be, in fact I found myself liking The Croods very much. I did think that the ending was a cop-out, it seemed to me that the film didn't know how or when it was going to end and it seemed too convenient also. And I also thought that the film was a little too long, some of the story structure towards the end seemed on the verge of petering out. The animation however is really wonderful, it is detailed and very colourful with the character designs well modelled and convincing in movement. If you see The Croods, try and see it in 3D if you can, I am usually not a fan of the 3D gimmick but this is one of those instances where the action is enhanced instead of the 3D detracting from it. At the top of my head, only the Vincent Price film House of Wax(also given the 3D treatment) has had that effect on me. The soundtrack is rousing and lively, though appropriately subdued in the more touching moments. The dialogue is very funny and extremely smart, with much to entertain children and adults. It is quite sophisticated in tone, although it thankfully doesn't feel too much. Amongst the humour, there's also room for some morals and family issues, and they are nicely done without being too heavy-handed. The story doesn't exactly break new ground and will seem formulaic to some. On the other hand, it is briskly paced, consistently engaging and is heart-warming in more ways than one. The prehystorical slapstick is frantic, but hilarious and never too childish. The characters are also a large part of the fun, they are very likable and amusing characters and you can relate to them. Grug and Guy's relationship was especially convincing. The voice work is great. A more restrained than usual Nicholas Cage is a big surprise and he is an ideal fit for his character. Emma Stone and Ryan Reynolds are equally appealing, and Cloris Leachman relishes some of The Croods' most amusing moments. In conclusion, great colourful fun without being among the very finest from Dreamworks. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Really good animated movie,"The Croods is a really good animated movie that's extremely colourful and fun even if some of the Croods are a little annoying at times.

What is wrong with some people?,"This is the story of a family of Neanderthals that live every day in fear. Everyone they knew had met an untimely end and Grug, the family's father is determined to keep them all alive. There are some problems in the form of teenage angst with Eep. Craving freedom she sneaks out one day and meets what I assume was Homoerectus, a guy named Guy. He tells her the end is coming and she tries to convince the family to follow Guy. The family is forced to go on an unwanted adventure, trying to conquer their fears in order to survive and, pardon the pun, evolve to a new life. This movie features some great actors providing the voices of the characters, but Nick Cage shines as this seems like a role he was meant to voice.I read a review on here that said this film was ""insensitive, rude and mis-educational"". Not everything that our children watch needs to be educational. What is wrong with having fun? I suppose The Incredibles depicting super heroes living normal lives among us is educational? Or finding Nemo with talking fish and sharks that try not to eat fish, their sole source of nutrition? Stop taking life so serious. I feel sorry for the kids being raised like that. As for insensitive and rude, I do not get that either. Who would this movie insult? As far as I know Neanderthals are extinct. This family friendly movie showcases exactly how far a dad will go to protect his kids, and to me there is nothing more touching.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"The Plot is Crude, Not the Humor","But that mostly falls flat, literally - the slapstick comedy is especially appealing for younger children. Don't look for any accuracy regarding prehistoric humans, and the environmental processes and animals are just pure fantasy - evidently in the tradition of Ice Age. That's not shade for being inaccurate, truly it isn't, just observing an interesting phenomenon. The idea seems to be that humans were being held back by fear, which lead to them hiding in caves, except when they emerged as a family to play football with giant eggs before eating them; but some humans, like Eep (who is curious like Eve, I guess...), try to climb up out of the cave to gaze at the sun. A reference to the Platonic Allegory of the Cave, I think. Also, fire and ideas ultimately bring down the (benevolent?) patriarchy of Grug, but they are brought by ""Guy."" Also, in the process, humans get pets! Ok, so the movie is confused like its cave-people, but still lots of fun: both kiddos enjoyed watching it again with me, even though they had already seen it last summer at their day care. And the 3D is pretty awesome!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
What a great memories you brought back to me by this,"I usually don't write reviews here, but this movie brought me back a feeling that I didn't think I would have it again. It was a great experience that made me decide to write a review about this movie.Like any other child I used to watch animation. It comes to this part of your life when either you ignore animation and watch it only because you're with a child, or you keep watching it and ignore what some other people say that it's ""cartoons"". I used to laugh, smile, dream and even cry watching animation. I got busy in the last couple of years with school and work that I didn't watch animation for a couple of years. The couple of times I watched animation after that, it was not comparable of course to the moments I had when I was a child. You would think these feelings and moments are gone forever.I came across ""The Croods"" trailer online and just by watching the trailer I had the thought that this might be a good movie. I went with a friend to watch it and that was a big surprise, beyond my imagination.I laughed almost half of the movie. I had these great moments that I thought I'll not get it ever again. I just melted inside that movie. I should not call it a movie anymore, its a great experience. The effort of designing each character is right there clear in every frame. The dialogue is awesome, so natural and funny. The main concept is great and made me think about a lot of ideas I had and still having in my mind on a daily basis. I just had a wonderful experience that I thought for some reason I will never get again.

Great Movie For The Whole Family,"The Croods is a wonderful movie with a great story and amusing characters. The graphics were fantastic as well. Dreamworks has been in fine form recently, delivering great movies (like Rise of the Guardians and Puss in Boots) that will live long the memory.What I really found surprising, was the fact that the movie was heartwarming and quite emotional. The movie also had various majestic animals on screen, which really enhanced the feeling of being in the prehistoric time. You almost forget you are in the prehistoric time due to the behavior of the family members, which of course is very much like modern day family behavior. The story is constantly effected by the choices each of the family members take, which makes for an interesting plot.I believe that everyone will enjoy the Croods, no matter what age you are. It's fun, heartwarming and a great experience. A-List actors Nicolas Cage, Ryan Reynolds and Emma Stone provide the voices, which are instantly recognizable, and they really suit their characters. The director also did a magnificent job, especially with the cameras. The camera follows the action excellently and doesn't disorient you. So overall an amazing movie and one that is fun to watch with family or even girlfriends. It's the feel-good movie of 2013 so far.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not very good.,"I was highly disappointed by this movie. Although the Animation itself was flawless. The storyline lacked punch and edge. Litrally all the good parts of the film was in the trailer. The storyline was completely predictable, with the whole, boy meets girl, line flowing through. Even my partner who isn't even trained in Media found it dull. The trailer makes the film out to be an Epic Rom-com. Although there is a theme of romance running through out the script, it was not as funny as the traliers had made it out to be.On a positive note, there was some good use of causality and a couple of heart warming scenes between Eep and her Father. Emma Stone and Ryan Renolds played excellent role's and sounded completely natural.The Animation itself was flawless, I just felt that there were too many trailers, which ruined a lot of scene's and made the film very predictable.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
So much fun! This is amazing!,"'The Croods' gives us an interesting insight into what life might have been like for the Cavemen, having to hunt for food with danger lurking around every corner, having very little knowledge of the world they live in and perceiving pretty much everything as dangerous.I loved the members of this totally dysfunctional family: the over-protective Dad, caring Mother, cautious son, curious and adventurous daughter, the wild baby, and the hilarious grandmother. Then we have Guy - a mysterious and very knowledgeable teen, far more modern than the cave people. They never explain where he comes from or how he came to be so informed, but I suppose it doesn't really matter for the sake of making the film work as well as it does.The animation is fantastic! The premise is very similar to 2002's 'Ice Age', only with cavemen instead of Dinosaurs. Yet it still feels very original. 'The Croods' is a beautiful movie about family bonding. There's loads of action, adventure, humor and beautiful scenery. This is imaginative and a hell of a lot of fun! I loved it!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Actually, pretty amazing!","You have to take into account the expectations as well, I mean I was going to watch the film, probably on fast forward, because it is a silly animation movie. I was going to enjoy it for the few scenes that are probably in the trailer as well and call it ""seen it"". Can you, then, believe I never touched the keys from my laptop and watched it all start to end?The film had great animation, even if 3D, an interesting world, with all kind of weird animals that are not real, yet tons of fun, but most of all, a really nice script. It had the usual tricks to make most audience like the movie, in this case the cosy feeling of family love and support and the expected caveman clichés, but also subtlety and expression of a whole range of emotions. In a sentence, it made me feel good watching it.The Croods had only eight people in the cast, including for the roles of one small animal and one inarticulate child, and not the most famous ones either, but they did a great job.Bottom line: I may be a sucker for transformative journeys with your entire family movies, but I really enjoyed it. For a Hollywood animation film, it is even more amazing. Or maybe I was just in the right mood. No dirty jokes, no references to other films, emotions that can be enjoyed and understood by small children, but with added subtlety that will entertain adults as well.

"Exciting, Interesting and can watch with family !","Watched It yesterday. Liked it very much. I just love how the film showed the evolution from cavemen to gatherer, hunter. funny too. Now, it is hard to find any movie that we can see with family. Adult Materials is every where. I find it more useful that it doesn't contain any of that stuff and safe for children.The story comes out to be more interesting eventually. I really feel pity for the brother. I saw that is's been nominated for Oscar too. Good choice. I am eagerly waiting to see The Croods 2.Hope, it will me as enjoyable as the first one.

Croods is safe,"This movie was a lot better than I expected. Granted, it's not the best Dreamworks movie, but it's still pretty decent. While at times it does feel like Ice Age 3 and The Flintstones, it still has enough originality to pass as an original screenplay. While it probably won't be nominated for Best Animated Film at the Oscars, it has enough heart to be one of the best animated films of the year. Unlike some dull animated films that have come out this year, like Epic, this actually has a good script, fun humor, and a great lesson at it's core.

It's in nearly all ways perfect,The Croods might be one of the most perfect movies I've seen. From the humor to the life lesson none of it feels misplaced or bad. Even the story just being a glorified walking simulator makes sense with the plot. Including with each character main goals. Nearly every joke in this movie made me laugh or at least chuckle a bit. The life lesson in this movie is perfect with the character progression also being both funny and perfect. Of course there are some minor problems but they can be fully ignored with everything else. If you want a movie to watch with the family that's funny with a perfect life lesson for kids then go watch The Croods.,10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Croods,"The Croods is a good family fun animated film that will make kids happy but adults also can have fun while watching it if they dont think about it to much and just decide to have some fun.This film has a good animation and very good voice acting and the best part in that sagment was none other then Cage who was great in his over the top voice acting here,rest of cast was also good and their characters very funny and fun to follow around.Croods is a good animated film that whole families can enjoy",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
You Had Me At Tomorrow...,"The Croods opens with voice-over narration that introduces the Crood family. The animated sequence is minimalist and emulates cave drawings (a theme running through the film) while it also felt like an homage to Dusan Vukotic, The Zagreb School and other 'reduction' animators of the 1950s and 60s. The story has a monomyth structure that integrates family roles in at the critical spots (future husband as herald, villain as co-paternal figure, etc.). The first scenes have a specular quality and with a minimalist mise-en-scene it might have been regarded that these directorial choices were purely exploitative to the 3-D gimmick. Good fun action establishes the quirks of a 'pre-nuclear' family experiencing 'cave-in fever'. Father Crood (voiced by Cage) has all the qualities and clichés of a responsible father. In fact, the characters and the story are quite cliché - but it isn't exploitative. Freshness is retained through moments of self-reflexivity (the popcorn pile, Guignol shows) and clever situational puns. The minimalist elements of the staging and mise-en-scene are banished like darkness in light once the family are forced to venture out into the more majestic parts of a fantasy world. It is a fantasy world - with dozens of original creatures and hybrids that make one think of Disney's Alice in Wonderland. Some of these creatures provide strong character 'support' such as 'Belt' and 'Duggie'. Even 'villains' are appropriated as pets in this dangerous and threatening but awe-inspiring and enlightening world. The threats are ominous but not frightening. The Croods are cute animated characters and the animation itself is of top quality and exemplar of technical sheen (the luscious fur was the most enticing and tantalizingly tactile lure in the 3-D quality of the film). The cave-family is physically atavistic in appearance, but jovial and comically gentle in demeanor. The diastema creates warm smiles and helps forge loving moments. The ending is a happy one and there is no Bambi trauma moment in the entire film. One of the advantages of digital rendering is the open possibilities that lie outside the more rigid film medium (the 180 flip dive into the water is mesmerizing). There are great moral lessons about growth and acceptance that are convivial and not preachy. My favorite part of the film is a sequence where Father Crood makes his first effort at personal growth by adorning himself in 'modern' innovations like the 'Pre-Funk' George Clinton coif. His ideas backfire into a laugh-out-loud homage to Looney Tunes mayhem. One other homage stood out in the genial portrayal of a quest for paradise - that is Wil Vinton's Adventures of Mark Twain and the Adam and Eve story that Vinton retells within that film. You can't tell me there aren't Biblical allusions either - with the Noah's Ark moments at the end, paradise lost theme and Adam-Eve procreation imperative underlying a more overt father-daughter relationship of trust, growth and acceptance. The relationship of minimalism and magnitude play well for a sophisticated viewer while the genial takes on humanism and family entertain universally.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

I'm not that jaded but...,"The Croods is a new Dreamworks animated film that takes its cues from the Flintstones, Ice Age, and The Gogs, and tries to be oh so hip and with-it and falls flat at nearly every attempt.OK. I get that it's just an animated film and is not trying to really emulate the lives of early humans, but I found the modern societal references (and the sheer volume of them) to be extremely distracting, annoying, and just frankly misplaced. A few modern references, maybe, but the amount in The Croods was overkill and didn't work.Secondly, I didn't know that cavemen had what seem to be superhuman powers. I'm not talking about running from predators at ridiculous speeds (that happens in all animated films) There is a certain amount of suspension of disbelief that is expected.No, I'm talking about climbing sheer cliffs and and upside down cliffs, and falling (not just once but many, many times) from tremendous heights without getting hurt or injured or showing any sign of doing so. Yet needing ""shoes"" to walk over a bed of sharp seashell-like thorn.You expect things like this in a Road-Runner/Coyote type slapstick movie. Here, again, it is out of place and doesn't work.While the 10 and under set may not be bothered by all this, it made for an extremely unpleasant movie for me.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the better family movies,"As I am writing these lines, I've just looked up that the Croods are a Dreamworks franchise. If you consider the pool of family movies aimed at smaller kids, quite often you'd find lazy cash grab projects that might distract a toddler for a little while but offer next to nothing for the guardian. Croods left me with a similar impression up until I actually watched the movie.Both movies deal with themes of family and companionship, though both from a slightly different angles. Hence watching the sequel expands the first movie rather than copies it. On top of that there are quite a lot of funny gags that satirize modern society. Additionally there are plenty of colorful animal hybrids that are quite fun. The Croods are by far not the best Dreamworks movie, but still better than other family entertainment so If you ever find it available or crave a change from seeing Shrek for the hundredth time, give Croods a go. Since I feel the same way about both movies, I'll copy this review to the other one as well.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

An Enjoyable Prehistoric Animation Romp,"The Croods are the last cave family in their ""neighbourhood"" with the other families having been killed by one thing or another. This leads Grug Crood (Nicolas Cage) to be a bit over-protective with his family meaning that they hardly ever leave their cave and that anything new is bad. Eep Crood (Emma Stone) is more adventurous, though, and is constantly frustrated by her dad's over-bearing manner, so one night she leaves the safety of their cave to investigate a strange light. It's here that she meets Guy (Ryan Reynolds)...an incentive young boy who predicts ""the end of the world"". After an earthquake destroys their cave, the Croods - along with Guy - leave to find pastures new, bringing about different dangers & adventures.The Croods is an enjoyable roller coaster animation ride, but unfortunately I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would. Don't get me wrong...it's still a very good movie, but it was just missing a certain something to make it better. DreamWorks have done better animated movies with Shrek and Turbo to name some, but that doesn't mean The Croods is bad.As we have come to see from a lot of DreamWorks movies, the animation is superb and is crystal clear, especially in Blu-ray. The humour is constant throughout the movie as well which is good because that's much better than an animated movies that only have two or three funny moments and then nothing else. The humour isn't ""roll about laughing"" kind of humour, but it is enough to definitely make you laugh.One wee minor downside was that a couple of scenes did tend to drag on a bit with the ""chasing for food"" opening scene being one of them. The casting was spot on as well and they all done a great job. None of the characters were annoying, and I actually think that Belt - Guy's pet sloth - is one of the best characters in the movie.The Croods isn't just a kids movie but is a family movie, and it doesn't matter if you're 6 or 60...this is a movie that everyone can like.Watch it and enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""The Croods"" Review","""The Croods"" has a simple story about old vs. new and family. The family must move when disaster strikes and learn to adapt to new ways of doing things. Resistant at first, they meet a boy named Guy, who helps them rediscover the ever changing world. The film tells us to embrace new things with open arms and enjoy all the wonders life has to offer. Not everything new is evil or makes you any less of a person than your ancestors. Family is a pretty central part of the film as we can see them bonding and doing a lot of things together.The film is a little light on heart and emotions, but more than makes up for it with its unique sense of humor. The punches keep rolling with slap stick, sight gags and jokes about cavemen and their primitive ways. I was literally laughing from beginning to end. The sheer amount of creativity in the film is commendable and I was constantly thinking where do they come up with some of these ideas.Chris Sanders and Kirk De Micco do a pretty good job of directing the film. They give a good amount of attention to the family and each individual character. I really like how certain things introduced earlier in the film serve a purpose later on. If any animated movie ever deserved to get nominated at The Oscars for Cinematography, it would be this one. The shots and angles are so unique and filled with so much energy. The sweeping shots of the landscape and the skies are beautiful to the eyes. The hunting scene early in the film is really where most of this is apparent.The characters are good, especially Grug. He's funny and a really devoted father, but incredibly stubborn. Nicolas Cage brings the right amount of crazy caveman and caring father to his character. Emma Stone as Eep is also a solid character. She's curious and her design is way better than what the trailers make it out to be. I like how she isn't the typical perfect figured woman. She has messed up teeth, she has a full figure, and overall is not bounded by gender roles. The rest of the cast is okay as they don't do much. The mom is kinda bland, Thunk and Gran provide some of the comic relief, and Guy is just the cool kid that has the crazy new ideas that shake up the family.The animation is quite gorgeous especially the hand-drawn opening sequence. The desert scenes are desolate and feel very isolated. A great juxtapose to it are the lush and vibrant forest locations. The directors do a lot visually with the film and make everything the characters see feel new to us as well. When they see stars for the first time, it really feels like you're really seeing stars for the first time. The character designs are unique and highly creative. Every creature is completely new and never before seen. Score for this film is actually quite good. It feels very prehistoric, but with a modern flare. It gets really exciting and emotional when the film takes a slight dramatic turn.Overall ""The Croods"" is a pretty good film. It has probably the best cinematography I've ever seen in an animated feature. It's highly creative, and the animation is quite beautiful. The main characters are well rounded and the side characters serve their purpose. The story is a little simple and lacks an emotional punch, well at least until the end, but it is effective. Humor is top notch and will keep you laughing all the way through. I give it 4/5, creative, hilarious, and a fun time for families of all ages.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Croods is a perfect family outing which is surely be enjoyed once you step into the roller-coaster ride,"The best part of watching an animation film is that it is full of vibrant,colors , cheerful and attractive visual effects.

The initial scene where they show how caveman's family finds food in midst of now where has executed brilliantly. The film captures some of best moments when they begin the journey of lifetime to find new home. The fantasy world , unbelievable animal characters and funny nature habits puts icing on the cake.

Missing story alert!,"The Croods is a big budget animated film with an interesting premise in search of a story.It gives us a sequence after sequence of a cave-dweller family coming to terms with a a very fast changing world that challenges any notions of mortality that we may have about our homo- sapien forefathers.But then its an animated film and death proofness shall not be held against them. Heck! its not the case for any Die Hard film, so a bunch of animated characters have all the right to survive rough landings from zillion foot high cliffs.And since the primary audience for this latest Dreamwork's "" product"" is likely to be children accompanied by guilt ridden parents it can be safely assumed that all the cute slapstick action will hit home with its core tiny- tot audience.As the cave painting inspired credits roll we are introduced via voice-over to the The Crood family led by a brawny father named Grug, who guards his flock with a fierce adherence to the laws of survival he has learned the hard way.It involves as less interaction with the outside world as possible, which means spending much time in a claustrophobic cave and killing all notions of curiosity, which killed not just the cat but most of his brethren. This goes against the nature of his vivacious daughter Eep who craves to see what lies outside the cave.The premise is as old as the hills and the Neanderthal man.Soon enough her wishes are answered and they find themselves catapulted into a world very different from the one they knew and they must survive and make up new rules along the way.As it turns out the only new rule they need, is that there are no rules, and they must use a part of the body they haven't paid much attention to thus far – namely the brain.Grug says he doesn't need brains and flexes his muscles to illustrate his hair brained point.His foil in the new psychedelic, dangerous and seductively beautiful world is Guy, who is a young chap with the gumption of Tom Sawyyer and Huck Finn rolled into one, the type that young girls that cant help but fall in love with.Guy and his success in saving their fur covered behinds on countless occasions makes Grug jealous and insecure as the gang stumbles from one deadly animal attack to another.They will discover fire, grey matter and importantly shoes in the process.The cry of ecstasy that Eep lets out when she first wears a pair of boots tells us that in the very distant future a certain Mr Jimmy Choo will become a billionaire and male-kind's nemesis.The Croods examines its characters with the same nonchalance that Grug makes drawings on caves to illustrate his ""put you head in a hole in the ground theories"" and undoubtedly his doodles will not make art loves swoon like they do over the Bulls in the Altamira caves in Spain.The film limits itself to following the escapades of grumpy father, cutie pie daughter and cocky wise Guy at the expanse of the rest of the family and creates only unpredictable nature as the adversary.The Croods is full of slapstick comedy and has none of the dialogues and word play that will amuse the accompanying adults.It has no story and little character development, not to speak of a background score that could have lifted the film up, when it threatens to sag under the weight of its animation showiness.Small children will love its a gag a minute format but older children, I suspect, will see through its severe limitations.The film has a star cast of big names doing voiceovers but I found none of the distinctiveness of Nicholas Cage in the voice of Grug. The animators do a competent job and the 3D effects are half decent in some sequences which makes the film intermittently bearable.Built into this film is the somewhat tenuous message that not listening to parents can be rewarding and that parents tend to be somewhat behind the curve.While a sense of adventure and inventiveness is a invaluable lesson children need to learn, this film delivers it in a way that very young children can easily misconstrue.Ultimately from the perspective of a 5 year olds father, kids can watch Tom and Jerry at home on Cartoon Network and the economics of visiting the multiplex for The Croods just does not work out, if you build in the cost of the popcorn and soda and over three hours of time. I walked out feeling suckered by the marketing wizards behind The Croods. The characters here are sometimes cute but the film itself is mostly crude. Be selfish, let your kids sit this one out.Published on my blog mostlycinema.com",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very good family movie,"Think if Dreamworks try to take their twist on Ice Age but focuses on a modern cave family. What do you get? You get a smi good and fun that will have your little ones laughing till they die. While at most points it's trys to be too modern and a bit cliche manly at the first half and takes away form the story and focuses on just pop cultural references and modern jokes. Which makes the film fall flat on. But of coruse this film isn't all that bad. Nicolas Cage voice work was one thing that worked in this. But even with that, it's because he's a over the top actor so it's not that hard to laugh at. As for the other voice work like Emma Stone and Ryan Reynolds, they didn't do half bad. Plus I really enjoy the world they go through. It's wonderful to look at.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

I won't spoil anything, but the story is about how a caveman's daughter is tired of the old routine day to day life so she explores and sooner or later the family joins in and goes in on a big adventure. It is my favorite animation at the moment, and as a animator i think Dreamworks made a high quality movie. I hope it wins a Ocsar tomorrow, but this movie is underrated compared to Frozen which probably will take the Oscar.

Journey Through the Prehistoric Wonders: 'The Croods' Delivers Visual Delight with Room for Growth,"""The Croods,"" a prehistoric comedy adventure, offers a delightful, if not groundbreaking, journey into the world of a family discovering the wonders beyond their cave. The film, directed by Kirk DeMicco and Chris Sanders, is a visual feast, with lush landscapes and vibrant colors that bring the ancient world to life. The animation is top-notch, capturing the rough textures of the natural world and the expressive faces of its characters with equal skill.The voice cast, led by Nicolas Cage, Emma Stone, and Ryan Reynolds, brings a palpable warmth and humor to the proceedings. Cage, as the overprotective patriarch Grug, delivers a performance that is both endearing and comical, embodying the fears and desires of a father facing a rapidly changing world. Stone, as the adventurous daughter Eep, is the heart of the film, her yearning for exploration and understanding resonating with anyone who has ever felt confined by their surroundings.The narrative, while familiar, is buoyed by its brisk pacing and a series of inventive set-pieces that keep the audience engaged. The Croods' journey is one of discovery, not just of new lands, but of new ideas and relationships. The film deftly handles themes of family dynamics, fear of the unknown, and the necessity of adaptation, making it a tale with lessons for both young and old.The plot, though serviceable, treads well-worn paths and sometimes lacks the depth that could have elevated it from good to great. The humor, while often effective, occasionally resorts to low-hanging fruit, undermining the film's more heartfelt moments with cheap laughs.The character development is uneven. While Eep and Grug undergo significant growth, other members of the Crood clan are given short shrift, reduced to one-note caricatures that serve more as comic relief than as fully realized individuals. This is particularly true for the character of Gran, voiced by Cloris Leachman, whose potential for wit and wisdom is often sidelined for predictable old-age jokes.In terms of thematic exploration, ""The Croods"" plays it safe. It touches on the importance of innovation and openness to change but does so without delving deeply into the complexities these issues present. The result is a film that, while enjoyable, misses the opportunity to offer a more nuanced or challenging perspective on its themes.""The Croods"" is a film that succeeds in entertaining and enchanting its audience with its visual splendor and charming characters. It is a commendable effort that provides a fun-filled ride for families looking for light-hearted fare. Yet, it falls short of reaching the heights of animated classics that manage to balance humor, heart, and depth with more finesse. It's a solid addition to the animated canon but not one that will redefine the genre or stay with viewers long after the credits roll.",,Anonymous,Animation
Nothing special but VERY funny,"This movie is really funny. I don't know if that comes from the delivery of the lines or the physical comedy and ridiculousness, but I love it. The designs are creative, the cast is fun and talented, it's surprisingly well-written, it's heartwarming, light, and the character growth from both Eep and Grug is admirable. It's genuinely kind of emotional, which I wouldn't have expected going into it.This movie does sort of drag in the middle. It's nothing super memorable, the plot is pretty predictable, and the soundtrack is really generic. There are a few plotholes here and there and it's probably not very entertaining for an adult audience.But I love this movie either way. It kind of gets more hate than it deserves; it's not super smart or anything, but it's a genuinely good movie that made me laugh more than most things in cinema these days.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"It's hard to describe... really, I don't know if I liked it or not.","The Croods... there is a lot to say about this movie. The movie is unlike any animated movie I have seen, which is weird because one wouldn't suspect that BECAUSE it is like so many other animated movies but ISN'T! The Croods steps into a weird territory where it does a lot of things familiar but then does all of the familiar things in a nearly unrecognizable manner. This is why I consider this movie a good movie because it is one of the ONLY animated movies that really confuses me... and I'm not easily confused.The movie starts off with explaining that The Croods are the last of what was once a neighborhood of cavemen. Sadly, all died, so now the Croods stick by the rules and live in fear. What makes this movie ingenious is that it doesn't know who the main character is. Eep seems like the main character, but Grug gets a lot of screen-time as well. Also, the movie was very smart. Grug could've been the bad guy. He could've had no redeeming features. HOWEVER, it is established early on that the only reason any of them are alive is because of his strength and endurance to keep everyone alive. Grug isn't smart, but he will risk his life and do anything to keep his family safe. Heck, he even doesn't eat food for over a week just so that his family can eat. That is a loving father. This is one of the reasons I like this film. A lot of movies have trouble making a good father character, but this one gets it... at times.If you've seen the trailers, you know that a newcomer comes along named Guy who is an inventor. The nice thing this movie did is that showed right off the bat how physically epic the Croods are in strength and just how weak Guy is compared to them. Eep lifts Guy up with her wrist and nearly kills him within the first couple seconds of meeting him. Speaking of strength, this movie has its momentum done right. Whenever the Croods are moving, they move with A LOT of speed and are incredibly strong (punting rocks hundreds of feet away).I'm getting distracted. The real thing I find interesting about this movie is that it is one of the only animated movies I have seen that has blended incredible realism with Looney-Tunes slapstick. The movie is gorgeous. It really is. The water made me pause for a second and realize that it wasn't real water... but I thought it was for a moment. Most movies either use CGI for the beautiful shading but still have cartoony visuals (Madagascar, Tangled, Frozen) or either they use incredible realism (Beowolf, Rise of the Guardians, Brave) but this movie combines both. The humor and the movement is directly taken from several Pink Panther skits and Merry Melodies, but the animation rarely stretches of squashes. They still move like they are real. It confuses me because naturally that sounds like a horrible idea... but... this movie pulls it off. I can't say that I have ever seen a movie that has done animation this way.The story itself if pretty good as well, but is fairly kid-oriented. There are some laughs for adults, but some jokes seem a little too... kiddish at times. Which is another weird thing: this is an animated movie that isn't trying to be dark and serious! Really, this movie is perfectly content with being light-hearted, funny, and really laid-back. It has its dark moments and its sad moments, but overall it is upbeat and happy. It is refreshing to see this kind of movie get released.Also, the soundtrack is really good along with the character interaction. None of the characters are obnoxious and they all interact with each other in a very realistic manner. I think half of this movie's humor comes from the ""subtle"" jokes or the little gags that fly by in a second. There is a lot going on in this movie, but it may be hard to pick up on the first time.All in all, The Croods DOES have some hiccups and you will notice them when watching it. However, when I look back on it I realize that this is a special movie. It is unique in almost every way and ISN'T really unique at all. I wouldn't mind being stuck in the world that was created... for just a couple minutes more.Oh yeah, and the creatures were cool. Not basing it off of real animals is clever.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""I'm a.......  Caveman!""","The Croods, a film with extreme slapstick humor and a solid idea that wasn't completely executed all that correctly. In the first 15 minutes it started pretty slow yet this film always keeps the kids laughing from start to end. The animation was surprisingly ahead of its time with amazing shots throughout. It picks up pretty soon mostly with Emma Stone's character who I believed I was going to hate but ended up endearing. The characters journey isn't as ""epic"" as I was led to believe but definitely not as dreadful. Each character has some actual range obviously in the humor scale but surprisingly in the dramatic one as well. All of the creatures and setting are beautiful/realistic with extreme creativity but there could have been more creativity in the humor, not just unoriginal physical humor(it still was pretty humorous). The moral/value of the story actually gets across to the audience quite fluently. The emotion felt pretty cliché/slightly forced when it actually counted but in other minor areas it ended up touching you. The Croods is an extremely heavy hearted film with great humorous attributes which needed some more originality, the actors matched pretty well with their characters as well, especially Nicolas Cage(surprisingly), there aren't so many faults but I was still searching for what would make this film stand out its still a solid outing which as you 've probably heard 1000 times, take the kids to see this.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

The animation is fantastic, but the plot is dumb and unoriginal. A lot of artistic talent was wasted on this dull story. I wouldn't recommend this movie, but a young child would enjoy it.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
I've never hated a movie this much before.,"OK, so I thought this movie would be good because everyone was talking about it, so I went to go see it. I regret seeing it. The animation is OK, but the writers should be fired. The movie is too corny and the sloth keeps saying dun dun duuuun! If the creators used witty writers, I would love this movie, but sadly... the writers ruined it. But, I gave the movie some stars because the characters were very well developed, and the movie had a really nice plot. The people of this movie took a big risk though. Movies about cavemen aren't popular. Nonetheless, great plot, bad writers. If a sequel came out, I'm not sure if it would be worth watching",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Funniest prehistoric family since The Flinstones,"A family of caveman who are led by Grug(Nicolas Cage) who never venture far there rock home, they go out by day to get food, by night they go inside the cave to stay safe. But the eldest daughter Emp(Emma Stone) wants to see more that is out there, so one night she ventures further more, she quickly comes across an adventurer named Guy(Ryan Reynolds), then her families perfect little home comes crashing down with rocks, so The Croods have to team with Guy in hopes to find a new home.A fun film for the whole family. It never gets to silly or to serious, it balances that out pretty well. Emma Stone was good, I believe they made animated Emp in her likeness. Nicolas Cage was great also, doing it more straight instead of just crazy. And everybody else was good, the animation was almost as awesome has Wreck it Ralph was.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A good time pass film but, not as great & hilarious as DreamWorks Animation's other staples such as Shrek, Madagascar, Kung Fu Panda, How To Train Your Dragon etc.","The Croods is a movie about the last surviving prehistoric family consisting of patriarch Grug(Nicolas Cage), Ugga(Catherine Keener) his wife, Eep(Emma Stone) his daughter, Thunk(Clark Duke) his son, Sandy(Randy Thom) his infant daughter & Gran(Cloris Leachman) his mother-in-law & the grand mom of the kids. Eep is filled with curiosity but, her father Grug, forbids her & the rest of the Croods from doing anything even the slightest bit risky, adventurous & fun, in order for the last early human family to survive. So, the Croods hide in their cave for a week, completely in darkness & go out of the cave, just to hunt for food. Then, the whole process starts all over again! One day, after Eep has a fight with her dad, she escapes from the cave at midnight after she sees a mysterious light coming from outside the cave. She follows it & meets the only surviving human outside the cave, Guy(Ryan Reynolds) & his pet, Belt(Chris Sanders). He tells her that the world as they know it is going to end & that they must leave immediately. However, Eep decides to bring the whole family along after they all witness various mountains getting destroyed, their cave along with it. She calls for Guy's help & an extremely reluctant & suspicious Grug decides to bring along Guy, albeit as prisoner, to help them get to the mountains before it's too late! From here on, the whole family, along with Guy, go on an adventure where they discover many beautiful & dangerous things, both plants & animals.This movie is a treat for the eyes, especially in 3D(no surprise nowadays). Though it was entertaining as most animated movies are, the story was the same overprotective father & curious daughter shtick, which came on screen very recently in Hotel Transylvania. Half of the jokes in the movie were slapstick jokes which got a bit tedious & childish after a certain point. The way Eep gets over excited after Guy gives her shoes is my favorite scene in the movie. It's not as hilarious as other recent DreamWorks Animation movie, Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted. The voice acting is spot on. Nicloas Cage is outstanding as Grug. Emma Stone is hilarious & mind blowing as Eep. Ryan Reynolds is charming & impressive as Guy. Catherine Keener is brilliant as Ugga. Clark Duke is hysterical as Thunk. Cloris Leachman is hilariously brilliant as Gran. Chris Sanders is awesome as Belt, especially his Dan-Tan-Taan bit! Randy Thom is spectacular as baby girl, Sandy. So, The Croods is not a must watch film. However, do watch it if you love animated films or, have a daughter who doesn't get along very well with you!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

I'd read one review that had called it 'The new Shrek', so I had very high hopes for this film. I'd honestly give it 0/10 if I could, I was bored throughout, barely laughed and felt like leaving halfway through. I went with a 4 and a 9 year old, they fairly enjoyed it but weren't blown away, and by the lack of laughs in the almost full cinema, I'd say that most (if not all) of the parents and kids there were bored and disappointed too. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, there are far better animated movies out there! An incredibly disappointing and forgettable film.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
A funny and beautiful movie!,"This movie is pretty good! It has really funny jokes, good story, cool characters, (my favorite character is Eep because she is so realistic), marvelous cinematography, animation and so on! All I can say is this film is hilarious and charming! I don't think this movie is appropriate for children under 7 because it's a pretty strong story that the kiddies won't understand. I hate it when they make such movies into a children's medium (which I find insulting and annoying). Another thing I like about this movie is that the wonderful Cloris Leachman takes a stand to play the Grandma ""Gran!"" Nicolas Cage+Grug=stupid funny (in a good way)! The only character I find annoying is the baby girl Sandy, she is too hideous! One thing that I disliked about the movie was the story was a bit too long to tell.

"Good fun, great voice-cast - highly recommended","I had seen nothing of the advertising for this movie and I didn't really know what to expect - perhaps more ice age stuff? But no - this has animation with focus on the fantastical, a great voice cast and a story line that is simple yet works surprisingly well and just invites you along for the ride.Nicolas Cage as Cave-dad is fantastic - Cage should definitely do more voice-acting as it seems to set him free from his usual manic style and just deliver a very different thing. But everyone works - I don't know if the cast recorded their dialog together, but there just seems to be great chemistry between the characters.And it's FUN! Great comedy - some of it slapstick, some of it from the character interaction and good dialog - and it doesn't take itself overly serious.A warning to those demanding high doses of reality - this is NOT it. The Croods deliver a prehistoric setting in the best tradition of what-if - strange animals and creatures you could almost believe had existed once upon a time.Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Really Fun and Enjoyable!,"The idea of The Croods had never really interested me when it released. I'm just not really into the Caveman sort-of story. However, I decided to watch this with some friends and it actually turned out a LOT better than I expected.Don't get me wrong, this isn't Dreamworks best animated movie, but I would say its up there. Let's start off with the setting. Moving from a desolate desert setting to a beautiful forest with many strange and unique creatures really adds that extra touch. Even the desert land was fun to look at! The animation that was shown when portraying these lands was just beautiful and looked great. Furthermore, the character designs are good! It's not hyper unrealistic like with Sony's newest Hotel T film, but it's not too realistic so you won't forget you're watching an animated film.So what lets the movie down a little? The story. It's your generic 'rebellious teenage girl' and 'protective father' storyline but with a twist: it's the end of the world! I'd say Dreamworks did a pretty decent job of adding a twist to it though which made the second half of the film a lot more pleasant than the first. One scene with the father character, known as Grug, was actually really heartfelt and I could see the care that was put in to this film.Overall, it was super enjoyable and I know that if I was a child, I would have adored this film.

The Croods shows DreamWorks mostly not in a cave,"I thought that the Croods was a good movie. It's not a perfect movie or my absolute favorite one of DreamWorks even, but it's fairly good, fairly funny movie that has likable characters. It's refreshing for example that this movie feels like it was in the prehistoric age without pop culture references at the expense of actual humor like lower tier DreamWorks movies. I like the dad Greg for example as he's an overprotective dad but who learns a lesson about it and is likable without being a jerk (most of the time) similar to Dracula from Hotel Transylvania. Although this brings me to one of the movie's problems as the entire ""family has trouble with a new boyfriend"" plot was already done the exact same way in Hotel Transylvania. Then again the boyfriend is still funny with a cool animal that he calls. What I'm saying is that while I still like the movie, sometimes it feels a bit unambitious and familiar. The animation is great as the prehistoric landscapes really stand out, but while the movie's writing is pleasant and funny I've seen a lot of the plot points before, and sometimes it's a bit scattered. It's still definitely worth watching though, just not the absolute best of DreamWorks.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Release the Baby,'The Croods' movie tells a story of a family living in the prehistoric time known as the 'Croodaceous.'Found interesting since its hilarious beginning. There are so many scientific facts all around. But the way they had uniquely expressed them is what make the movie special.The few main characters have a humorous lifestyle as they can take us into their crazy world.

A pleasent surprise.,"I had a good time watching The Croods. It had fun, heart and and a good message to delight the whole family.Is it one of DreamWorks' best? No, but absolutely not one of their worst. The voice cast is solid as usual and the animation is colourful and filled with a wide range of characters equally so.The pacing is a little uneven and the movie begins rather slowly. The beginning when we meet our main characters might be the movie's weakest spot, because of all the clihéd characterizations. An overly protective father who forbids everyone to go out of the known and explore and his rebellious daughter who defies his orders and changes it all for the family.But as soon as they all get moving with the new acqaintance of the family, both the fun and the creativity of the movie kicks in.

Incredibly Funny. Immensely Joyful. Deliciously Entertaining.,"An incredibly funny, highly enjoyable, delightfully entertaining & largely satisfying adventure from the talents working at DreamWorks Animation, The Croods is a fun ride for viewers of all ages and while it isn't without its shortcomings, especially in the storytelling department, it's got enough juice in it to be equally hilarious & rewarding for both kids & adults alike.Set in the prehistoric era, The Croods tells the story of a caveman & his family who have survived the wilderness for years by living together in one place instead of exploring the world around; something which their eldest daughter wants to do. Events are set in motion when their cave is destroyed, following which they embark on a journey to find a new home & are joined by an inventive homo sapien.Written, produced & directed by Kirk DeMicco & Chris Sanders, The Croods has a splash of everything to succeed as another fine adventure in the famous animation studios' repertoire but when it comes to human drama, it barely scratches the surface of that element. The film does try to take itself a bit seriously near the end but the effect of it isn't much compared to whatever unfolds on the screen before it.Still, not everything is flawed in this prehistoric setting for those who are looking forward to a fun-filled extravaganza will have a great time with it. Reason for that being the eccentric characters inhabiting the picture, expertly used slapstick humour, a few moments that have a surprising depth to it, its gorgeously rendered animation, fast-paced storyline & the very familial themes which are wonderfully presented.On an overall scale, while The Croods may not be amongst the best films that DreamWorks Animation has offered us to date, it still makes up for a pretty good light-hearted cinema & is best enjoyed when viewed with whole family. Although the humour does feel a bit forced at times & the characters aren't that well carved out, The Croods still delivers on many scales & is an adventure that wants you to never be afraid of exploring new things. Worth a shot!",,Anonymous,Animation

Entertaining family film that is truly enjoyable.,"Dreamworks' latest animated film is here. The Croods tells the story of a caveman family who embark on an epic journey once their beloved cave is destroyed.Some say that, when it comes to cinema, it isn't too hard to entertain the kids. That may be slightly true, but it's the films that entertain both adults and children that deserve the marks.This family's journey across a landscape that is both spectacular and perilous forms the perfect storyline for some great characterization and incredible animation. Directors/writers Kirk De Micco and Chris Sanders have clearly put in a lot of effort to ensure that this isn't just a run-of-the-mill animated flick.The characters are truly well written and well thought out. Witnessing the dynamics of this crazy family is both hilarious and touching. The talented voice cast (Nicolas Cage, Emma Stone, Ryan Reynolds, Catherine Keener) do a great job in fleshing out these quirky characters.The animation is top-notch. The emotional expressions, the changing landscape, the wild creatures, everything about this imaginative world is beautifully realized.Of course, the film dips into cliché-mode every now and then, but that's not a crime. This is a funny, entertaining family film that is truly enjoyable. It may not reach the heights of some of the classics, but it gets pretty close.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Absolutely colorful,"It's sad to know that this is the final movie of DreamWork's renaissance. Although DreamWorks has always put out mixed stuff, it became even more mixed and less good ones after Turbo so I count this the final one of DreamWorks' peak timesEnough of that let's actually talk about the movie itself. Even if the message is something we have seen multiple times, that doesn't mean it will be bad. Commonly used messages can be still good through good execution and that's the CroodsGrug's character arch is actually something really sweet. We start with an overprotective father to someone who learned to let their kids be more independent and open up to others. I also really liked Eep, despite all her hatred towards her father she still cares about him towards the end.The visuals are absolutely beautiful, I have always though Kung Fu Panda 2 had the best visuals out of DreamWorks but Croods comes in close because the new world scene, the volcano.

A forgettable movie from Dreamworks Animation,"I think The Croods quite works as kids movie, kids will love the character on this movie and the acceptable story. But for me this movie is unnecessary and so predictable. The story could be made a little bit more complex than this, especially the ending, they should stop the ending earlier without adding some scenes which ruins it.Still there is positive side from this movie. No doubt visual effects from Dreamworks Studio is great, although not the best. I actually enjoy and laugh at some scenes of the movie, it's ridiculous but funny. The best thing from the movie is the 3D, it really works. The 3D effect really watchable and consistent in every frame. Dreamworks animation continue their good looking 3D after making great shot in Madagascar 3.Overall The Croods is a good family movie and will entertain the viewers by it's eye-popping 3D. But compared with other Dreamworks Animation best creation like Shrek, How to Train Your Dragon or even Madagascar, it still below standard",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Simply Brilliant,"This was a treat, a feast for the eyes, plenty of belly laughs in fact the laughs just kept coming. The characters were well developed and cleverly observed. The kids (6 & 7) loved it, they got a little scared at certain points and a little upset at the sad moments, but all within reason. There was a little plagiarizing of other movies most notably Avatar, Pitch Black, but wow what a great job the animators did.What a Tour-de-force it didn't slow down or take a breather, relentless fun, jokes and action.

Great family movie but often stereotypical.,"This was a great family movie. I saw the Croods in English and 3D and what I liked most was the artwork. The world created around the the Croods is beautiful and colorful, sometimes even scary. The characters are also interesting and funny (I loved all of their different personalities) and there are numerous jokes throughout the movie for both children and adults.However, the story is often cliché, and so are the jokes. And from a feminist point of view this isn't a very good movie whereas the persons who get most attention in the movie, and the most important roles, are both male, while the girls and women have mostly stereotypical scenes (a nagging mother-in-law, a caring and sensible mother, a love-crazy daughter) and don't have any important affects on the story.Despite it's downfalls it was a very enjoyable movie to watch, so I can recommend it as a simple and funny movie for the family.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
DreamWorks Have Stepped Down Their Game,"I've always liked DreamWorks Animation. They've made some classics like Shrek and Kung Fu Panda, and a couple of their movies can even be looked at being as great as Pixar (in my opinion, Kung Fu Panda 2 and How to Train Your Dragon are about as great as a lot of Pixar's movies).They're normally the first CGI animation company to produce a movie each year, and this year is no exception. This is The Croods. When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I thought it didn't look like a DreamWorks film. It looked like something from Cartoon Network or Nickelodeon. In other words, not very appealing. But let's see how this was.The Croods is about a prehistoric family who's routine is to stay in a cave to survive predators, occasionally going outside looking for food. The family's daughter, however, wants to explore the outside world. One day, a giant earthquake ruins the family's cave, and they have to go out looking for a new one in an undiscovered world, together with a lonesome adventurer called Guy. That's as far as I'll go into the story.The Croods is actually much better than I expected. It isn't great, but it's at the peek of being really good. The major downsides are two things: The character models and the story. Let's first talk about the character models: They look like they were made for a cheap TV animated movie, but then later put into a DreamWorks film and given some better textures. The animation itself is as brilliant as DreamWorks movies usually are, but the character models just don't fit with the rest of the movie. At the very least, they don't fit in with DreamWorks' other movies.The story isn't special, but it isn't bad either. But my problem is the ending. I won't spoil anything, but there's a point in the movie where I think they should've just ended it, but then they had to keep going because they needed to make it a fully happy ending. It completely ruined the symbol of the characters, and the dramatic elements present where fully botched.On a good note, The Croods can be hilarious. It has a more CROOD humor (see what I did there), and I found it a nice change from your typical family animated movies. The characters are also entertaining, with a couple exceptions like Thunk and Sandy, who even though their a part of the family, serve no true point to the story.Overall, The Croods is a very entertaining movie. There is some lost potential in the writing and the character models are ugly, but the rest of the movie is pretty top-notch. It's not up there with DreamWork's best works, but it's still pretty good. My only worry about this movie is that it doesn't seem like this is just filler for a greater DreamWorks movie to come later this year, like Madagascar 3 was last year. Because the next DreamWorks movie is called Turbo, and it looks like a bland rip-off of Cars with snails. And after that, we get Mr. Peabody & Sherman, who I don't see how they need a feature film. All in all, 2013 won't be a great year for DreamWorks, I'm pretty sure of that. But we'll see.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
I had a feeling...,"I just shut it off after about 30 minutes; that was all I could take. Maybe someday Hollywood will realize that visual effects are not enough. The problem isn't that this film has no plot at all, nor even a bad plot. The problem is that it has the same plot as every other animated kids movie that's been made in the last 10 years. If you've already seen Brave, Tangled, or Frozen, then you've already seen this one, too. Same old story, different theme. Perhaps a better title would have been ""Not Another Animated Movie"". I gave it a ""2"" instead of a ""1"" based on the merits of its only redeeming quality - If you're having trouble sleeping, this movie can help.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
A journey through a brightly colored world and relationships,"The DreamWorks Animation this time seems to want to go beyond itself in order to succeed and has invented prehistoric era full of references to the current one without aping ""The Flintstones"".The Croods family consists of six members living in the last Stone Age family. They live in a cave and exit only in daylight, because in the darkness, it hides too much risk. The rebellious teenage daughter Eep (Emma Stone) hates life behind the stones and therefore opposes one night her father Grug's (Nicolas Cage) instructions. She leaves the cave and meets the Guy (Ryan Reynolds), a boy of the same age who can make fire. She learns that the earth will soon be destroyed and you can still find survival only in the direction of the sun from him. Shortly after-wards the Cave of the Croods is destroyed, they have no choice but to find a new home.Together with Guy they embark on a journey into the unknown and witness for the first time the world outside their stone dwelling. It goes through a colorful landscape, peppered with never seen before fanciful animals and many adventures. Only Papa Grug has a problem with the Guys because he has many ideas and innovation which overshadow Grug, but it eventually, it is replaced by Guy as a leader. However, sometimes we sense the personal feelings queued up in order to survive.We all know that every woman loves shoes. But it is heavenly to see how the Stone Eep girls can enjoy their first pair of boots and when it is handmade by a smart boy of the same age. What women want? The prehistoric 3D animated film The Croods is made by DreamWorks and directed by Christopher Sanders (How to Train Your Dragon) and Kirk DeMicco (Quest for Camelot). The animated adventure shows, just like the predecessor from the think tank of DreamWorks (Shrek, Madagascar, it again are the big ideas of the makers not only in inventing stories, but also in the creation of fantastic worlds and whimsical characters.The story is not only about survival, but about life, relationships and the experience of life with all its adventures. In the foreground of course there is a family and their lovable characters that are not always dissimilar to our own, with all their idiosyncrasies and quirks. So in the Stone Age too, one has to deal with adolescent problems, or catty granny. But it's also the way for each other to cohesion, mutual aid and taking responsibility for intelligence and the beginning of civilization. Lots of nice ideas, sloping figures and lovable animals like piranhas or a feathered rainbow colored giants cat à la Alice in Wonderland there is to admire. Many brightly colored scenes reminiscent of the immersion in the alien world of Avatar. With all the vividness of the film we sometimes surprised by the absolute silence, which is rather unusual for an animated film.It really is great fun to watch the Croods with all its endearing quirks and their whimsical environment in which they are looking for a new home.

How many people live in the ""dark ages"" so fearful of everything that (quote from movie) ""we aren't living, we're really just NOT dying"". There were a lot of biblical references about the world coming to an end, and really only needing love and the strength and courage to ""go toward the light"" in order to ""find Tomorrow"".Another metaphor, is that the SPEED with which these cave people must conduct all their daily activities just to survive replicates the fast-paced rat race which is now so ""normal"" we don't even realize how much we're missing. We rush rush rush all day long, just in order to...do it all over again the very next day. When they slow down and enjoy the beauty of everything around them is when these characters finally start to ""get it"".It's also a wonderful story about the importance of family and the dynamic between parents/teens. If we try to protect them too much our kids may be safe, but they can't grow, become independent, and really live; but, if we give them just the right amount of freedom and boundaries instead of rigid rules, they figure out what we most want them to learn anyway--on their own--which is REALLY what we parents wanted anyway. So ironically simple and commonsense, yet still so hard to get it right. I literally had tears streaming down my face in several parts. Great movie! Check it out!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
underrated good ol' animated movie,"I was surprised to see that this movie had a lower score than I imagined. And I would be surprised if someone were to call it ""mediocre"" or ""average animated kids movie"". It's got a lot of family value stuff, #justdadthings, and a really good story about not being afraid or whatever, which totally fits the setting of cavemen. There's so much imaginative design in here, with the different kinds of creatures and places they go. It's also really funny! The best part is when they do the egg thing in the beginning and play the USC marching band song. Iconic. also Guy is a dreamboat. just sayin.This animated movie is underrated, and it totally deserves more recognition.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Vidiot Reviews,"The CroodsThe advantage to being a caveman is that it takes absolutely no effort to stay on a Paleolithic diet.However, the hunter-gatherers in this animated adventure are having a hard time eating at all.Forced to live in a cave alongside the rest of her family, (Nicolas Cage, Catherine Keener, Clark Duke, Cloris Leachman) teenage troglodyte Eep (Emma Stone) takes every opportunity to explore the outside.One day she meets a cave-boy (Ryan Reynolds), who not only possesses fire but a plan to escape the pending end.When an earthquake leaves her clan homeless, she asks him to help lead her family to safety - much to the chagrin of her overprotective patriarch.While the animation is crude and the history completely skewed, The Croods prospers thanks to its archetypal characters and its goofy sense of humour.Furthermore, it's fascinating to know that cave people will eventually evolved into Creationists.Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Wow and mega wow,"I usually write reviews when I fell a movie is just awful or brilliant and I don't have to tell you that this piece of work is just beautiful Art. At first I thought this would be just another flimsy animation with just a few laughs here and there and a predictable ending, but ""boy was I wrong""!The first clash of the word ""WOW"" and my had started with the setting that is very elaborated and the fact that a lot of heart and soul has been imprinted in the characters and their quest for survival. This is actually as good as ""Wrack it Ralph"" (that did an equal amount of positive impression for an animation).If more animations will have the strong initiative and bold perspective of the sense of unpredictable as this movie has, I will be pleased as a crazy bear for honey. I recommend this one for all ages and I give it a 10 out of 10, just because it's original and very creative.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Croods are OK,"I saw this movie while on a flight. This movie was never on the radar for me to watch. The movie was acceptable but I wasn't overly impressed.The Croods are a caveman family that try to survive prehistoric life of large carnivorous animals and mother nature. They are guided by the conservative patriarch, Grug (Nicholas Cage). By conservative I mean a Kelly Clarkson never-stray-to-far-from-the-sidewalk type of conservative. Everyone is to be in the cave before dark and never go exploring strange things. The eldest daughter, Eep (Emma Stone), wants none of that lifestyle and flirts with danger every chance she gets.The movie was what I expected from an animation. There were some funny scenes and there was definitely a message. The actors suited their characters and the story was solid. It was OK as far as animations go.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Simplistic action comedy in computer game style,"This movie has a few funny moments but I think it is more geared toward young kids than older viewers. While the lead character is very similar in appearance and style to Shrek, this movie cannot even closely reach the depth and quality of story-telling.The Croods feels like a jump and run computer game, where you are constantly running from one challenge to the next. The action is exaggerated which appeals to young viewers. It reminds me a little of classic cartoons where the characters suffer great pain but are not really harmed. This, in my opinion, is OK for a short cartoon but gets annoying in a long movie like this.It is an okay movie but certainly not as great as the present ranking suggests. I would go for 2 out of 4 stars.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Incredibly fun for the whole family!,"Watched this as a family at least 5 times now, it's definitely a favourite! We had a fun time cracking jokes on who acts like which family member and it helped the kids get where dad's protectiveness comes from!

Fantastic time-waster for the whole family.,"Ironically, the biggest strength of Dreamworks' bright new animated adventure - which follows an anachronistic family from the prehistoric era - is the cast that are never seen. As the adolescent daughter yearning to explore the world, and the reason the Crood clan must leave their sacred cave, Emma Stone adds a level of vibrancy and energy that has now become expected from the super talented actress. In a bolder, but no less wonderful casting choice, Nicolas Cage is exceptional as the stubborn father who only wants to protect his dearly beloved yet drives them away because of it. The chemistry between Stone and Cage's characters is the film's greatest asset, however Catherine Keener's long-suffering mother/wife, Clark Duke's lovable moron and Ryan Reynolds' modernistic outsider all have their own shining moments, with Cloris Leachman's granny the only weak link among the players. Story-wise there's not much to write home about - the ages old 'living-safe-is-not-living-at-all' message drives the narrative yet thankfully isn't shoved down our throats - and the animation is of the usual standard without ever surpassing it; improvements to both, and a few more laugh-out-loud moments, would've nudged The Croods into real awesomeness. As it stands, this is still a fantastic time-waster come school holidays.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Of Unfulfilled Promises and Underachieved Efforts,"Rating: 2.9/5 stars Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Some nice scenes and refreshing dialogs strung together along with brilliant visuals just about manage to help this animated venture stay afloat. The first half of the movie is what really lets it down with random hurried scenes and a blatant disregard for the law of physics. I agree that an animated film is permitted to take certain liberties, but they should be taken with the permissible constraints of the film's environment and its script. Going overboard with these liberties becomes intolerable after a certain point of time. For instance, there's no way that a human being, leave alone an infant, can run faster than a wild cat or an ostrich-like prehistoric bird.From the second half onwards, the movie begins the ease up and starts focusing more on its characters and their interactions. Most notable of all is the endearing representation of the father-daughter relationship and the young guy who decides to help their family. The climax again begins on an enthusing note only to stumble into confounding territory that totally defies logic and rationale.Eventually, ""The Croods"" joins the ranks of an alarmingly increasing plethora of animated films nowadays that promise a lit, convinces us at the onset that it just might deliver on its promises, but alas, disappoints us in the end with the felling of what could have been.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Touching Caveman Family Fun,"The Croods is a caveman family headed by Grug (Nicolas Cage). He avoids everything scary and they mostly hide in their cave.

He's trying to escape the end of the world. Grug isn't happy but soon he finds himself slowly replaced as head of the family.This is a great family movie with a loving message. The family is full of love, and there really isn't an evil character unless you count the animals trying to eat the family.

The connection between father and daughter was the thing that reminded me of the movie Brave, than the colorful nature and animals which reminded me of the movie The Life Of PI. It was indeed a colorful motivational inspirational movie. Like most of these animation movies you walk out from the movie theater with hope and encouragements of not giving up. This movie gives the message of regardless of how scary things in life seems don't be afraid, GO FOR IT.

"Fun, but derivative...","Wow. Forget The Flintstones...the original 'modern stone age family' are The Croods. They spend half their life cooped up in a cave for safety (all the other people in their neighbourhood have either been eaten or fallen victim to diseases) and the other half in a desperate search for food.. There's the lovable big lug of a husband, the responsible, sensible wife, a sassy teenage daughter, her slow witted brother, a baby who thinks it's a dog and the abrasive grandma who's sole purpose seems to be to torture her son-in-law. Hmm... I may have heard of character dynamics like that before in... I dunno... Nearly ever single recent animated film ever made?They are introduced during a scene where they play American Football with an egg to keep it away from some hungry beasties... Shades of Ice Age perhaps? Then we find out the teen girl (who, with her muscles and red hair, resembles a bulked up Merida from Brave) is sick of her lot in life and wants to travel over the horizon. Is the feeling of De Javu overpowering you yet? Later, she meets a cute youth (he's drawn differently to the rest of the cast. Strange) who warns her THE END OF THE WORLD IS NIGH and she and her family must climb a mountain to ensure their safety. He also is ahead of his time in terms of his inventions (See: Flik in A Bug's Life, Rodney in Robots etc...) and has a cute little sloth sidekick called Belt. This creature expresses itself through squeaking noises and reaction shots. I bet you've never heard of any animal 'comedy relief' do THAT before.That's the main problem here... everyone is very nice and adorable... we care about their quest and want them to succeed. And lovers of slapstick will be in absolute heaven, there's more pratfalls and bonks on the head here than probably in the entire Laurel & Hardy back catalogue (Guess who bares the brunt of the punishment... THAT'S RIGHT!! The dad. You win no points). It's just everything has an air of: Seen it, Done it, Ate the T-shirt. It fails to add much depth to a format which was stale even before the movie is set, and the lack of many jokes for adults means it's one the kids will appreciate more than their jaded caregivers.Still, while it may be just going through the motions, that's not to say... to borrow a phrase from another cartoon show, you won't ""Have a gay old time"".

Visually stunning and very nice story,"The Croods is one of those movies that has you wonder at the marvelous setting that is provided by the filmmakers, while also managing to keep you attracted to the plot and its characters. Basically Eep is your typical teenager that in this case lives in a world in which her family are the only cavemen left alive and under the protection of her father, Grug, live a safe but uneventful life. Wanting to explore and find out more about her world, she escapes one evening and meets Guy, a human boy about her age that appears to be more knowledgeable about the world than her father. Eep learns that change is coming and that time is running out. Soon The Croods will be taken on an adventure in which they will bond as a family, while experiencing change in a world that is now showing its marvels. The Croods is a light animation feature that will surely entertain the little ones with some funny jokes and characters. As for the grown ups, the story is strong enough to hold the audience in and at some moments may have you doubting the outcome of this family that one can relate to. DreamWorks Animation is back in full force and I for one am pleased with this family film.Rating 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Just nothing happens... boring as hell.,"There is no story whatsoever in this film. Just that there's this one family, the only family on the face of this planet who've made it to the end because they've played it safe. This family loses their cave and they set out on a journey to find a new cave. The start of the film where all this happens is not at at all interesting and I was just hoping the adventure to follow would be a bit entertaining. But no, it was not at all fun. The characters are really boring and the voice acting absolutely bad. Especially that of Grug, voiced by Nicolas Cage. He was not at all fit for the part and I wish they had the sense to choose a more suitable voice for his character. Only Emma Stone's voice acting was actually good and Reynolds' too to some extent. Overall I couldn't care less about any of the characters. I didn't feel any connection with them and couldn't care less about them. None of the 'jokes' are funny at all and the one about the mother in law's death was in poor taste. Having said that, I don't think her character was funny or likeable too. Usually the grandma's character is supposed to be funny but this one's jokes felt forced and didn't land. The animation is okay, nothing so groundbreaking. Hell, early 2000's films had more eye catching animation. This film neither has any story, nor any interesting characters. It is that film you watch once and soon forget about. This fails to give you any sort of entertainment and I found myself waiting and waiting for some interesting part but unfortunately it ended without being able to provide me any satisfaction. I was so disappointed that I put on Finding Nemo, a film that I've watched countless number of times to lift my spirits a bit after completing this piece of trash film.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

"""For the most part it's Neanderthal compared to the Pixar stable."" - James Mottram, Total Film","The Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year and sound names such as DreamWorks, Nicolas Cage, Emma Stone, and Ryan Reynolds, lead to expectations that this film does not meet.

Brilliant Fun! 8/10,"Review: This movie is brilliant fun for the whole family. The characters are great and each one has there own weird and wonderful personality which was written extremely well. The storyline was well put together and it doesn't getting boring from beginning to end. The animation looks brilliant and the attention to detail is definitely noticed. There isn't really a fault with the movie. It reminded a lot like the Incredibles which also was a great movie. It's not very often that I can't find a fault with a movie, so this is definitely recommend for the whole family.Round-Up: The directors chose the right voices for each character. You can easily tell who Nicolas Cage is because his voice isn't much different from his every day voice. Every element was covered with the storyline. There's funny moments, along with touching moments like the relationship between Daddy Crood and his daughter. This must look amazing in 3D or in the cinema and it should give Pixar a kick up the bottom. I hope they don't wait ages for a sequel.Budget: $135million Worldwide Gross: $587millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there animation movies which are fun for the whole family. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

It seems to go no where fast.,"Croods is an interesting show, you got extremely detailed environmental animation like dirt/dust on gathering and wiping off from our cast then you got ridiculous character designs of the creatures, landscape and of course the cast themselves.The story follows the same route, in the beginning of the movie you got a retard rat race to get food that breaks any logical behavioral patterns of 'humans' and animals then you got the extremely intelligent scene where Eep first sees fire light and tries to capture it and understand it.Croods then grinds these alternating themes of stark stupidity and intelligence (childishness and maturity) throughout every aspect of the movie.The writers and producers should have decided to stick which way they wanted to go and not to mix and match to their whims and fancies. This major failing is why Croods will never be the enduring movie it was might be.But take heart Grug's climax despite the questionable logic that he uses is very satisfying can, like I said, if the ending has a decent pay off you can forgive almost anything.For those of you that can't stand this type of story telling consider The Croods like a tech demo, like my sister said, for the upcoming How To Train Dragon movie.

7.4 ??? This movie deserves a 10 out of 10.,"The Croods has all you could expect from an animation: Lovely characters, an astounding world, powerful emotions and a message to convey (which is split up in easily understandable chunks). The comedy appeals to all ages and is accomplished through a well thought slapstick, farce (which I fancy a lot) and ingenious twists.I am 19 years old and I was on the edge of the seat for at least 90% of the movie and my favorite movies are the LOTR trilogy, Forrest Gump, Pulp Fiction and from the animation standpoint The Lion King. The characters which at first seem ugly, brutal, violent and of course silly soon turn into humans with feelings and ideas.Last but not least, the soundtracks follow the feelings and personalities of each character and I am probably not the only man out there who thinks that Eep becomes voluptuous because of well placed soundtracks and scenery. A pretty hard to create paradox in an animation movie with The Flinstones looks, hence why I give 10 out of 10, The Flinstones were funny and nice but the Croods are much more than them. The names are very easy to remember and even the monsters are lovely and funny so the kids wouldn't have nightmares but can experience some thrills with every chase. The world is highly dynamic and evolves with the characters and their personality. As the Croods family becomes braver so the world around them turns richer and safer. Fire, which can be taken also as a symbol, turns into a magic solution to all problems of human life, even at the end, which is rather cute and hard to forget. There is also an internal and external struggle, which is easy to notice even for children. All in all, if you are looking for an animation movie at least 80 per cent as good as the Lion King look no further.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Beautiful Animation!,"Experiencing DreamWorks' The Croods leaps beyond giving you the feeling of a cinematic spectator, but instead the film actually accepts you as a member of the Crood family. This delightful animation follows a family of cave people as they are forced to depart from their comfort zone and embark on an adventure that will not only determine their physical and evolutionary survival, but also allow them to recognise that life can be worth living even when risks are taken.Out of respect for The Croods (the film and the family), it would only be fair to divulge the negative aspects of the animated film first before pouring out the praise. This is because the 98 minute feature itself thankfully reserves its lesser qualities for the first half of the film, before unveiling a sensationally satisfactory conclusion, as well as everything leading up to it. The Croods does suffer at times from some annoyingly loud and unfunny slapstick comedy that becomes borderline awkward in the confines of a theatre when not even the young children (the target demographic) are laughing. The humour most definitely is not intended to accommodate to all ages, though there are still plenty of laughs to be had, but you feel you are searching for them, rather than they are finding you. Furthermore, the 3D contributes nothing; as opposed to enhancing the experience, it actually (albeit only slightly) diminishes it. It should perhaps be known I am not a fan of 3D cinema anyway, but the visual novelty in The Croods really is questionable as not only is there no aesthetic augmentation, but the 3D in fact causes blurred vision when wanting you to focus on unimportant objects. The answer surely lies in the studio's economic, rather than artistic, justification.The animation itself is absolutely consistently energetic. It is both figuratively and literally full of life throughout, and the animators intentionally paint a bleakly coloured landscape for the initial setting of a repeated and oppressive lifestyle, before they allow a pallet of luminosity to blossom as the adventure commences and we and the characters are exposed to a greater sense of diversity. This parallels with the narrative of The Croods. The film essentially is a tug of war that sees the character Eep (voiced by Emma Stone) as the rope being pulled towards a life of safety and overprotectiveness by her father Grug (Nicholas Cage) while also allowing herself to be drawn to the exciting stranger guy named err... Guy (Ryan Reynolds). It is a battle between fear and hope and while Grug and Guy stand at the opposing ends of spectrum, the remaining characters are left to contemplate on which side they wish to be tempted towards.The comedy that is greatly genius in The Croods is that type of humour that humanises and personifies elements of primitive civilisation in a way that is updated so that modern beings can appreciate its cultural value. There are a number of really terrific comedic instances in the film that are aided by the perfect voice casting of the ensemble, but unfortunately these are often overshadowed by the abundance in dull physical humour. The characters that the actors voice are all likable in their own unique way, and cohesively lovable as a family. Like a family, you may find traits that you dislike, but in the end, you know that you love them.The Croods is certainly one of the superior animations that DreamWorks has to offer, though I would not necessarily guarantee that everyone will enjoy it as it becomes evident from the first second of the film that it has been made for a very young audience and is missing that adult appeal. The Croods is just a lot of fun with a predictable plot, but why regard that as negative criticism when in reality you desire for your predictions to come to fruition as you become so attached to this fictional family, especially at the surprisingly emotionally investing conclusion. No other two polysemic words could probably encapsulate the film more appropriately than: beautiful animation.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Loved the animals!,"As expected from a DreamsWork movie the animation is fantastic. It's quick and fluid, and the camera flows nicely as it follows the action. The Croods themselves have a seemingly unpleasant, bulky design to them but it actually works in the context of the film because the characters live in the wild, so big and broad makes sense. It is a little refreshing to see the main female character is not made out to be a stunning beauty, but rather someone who has been shaped by her environment. The beginning of the movie starts with in dry, mono-coloured landscapes before we get to see the bright colours of the jungle and continually seeing the weird creature reminiscence of designs of Sanders' previous works.Like other animated movies these days, The Croods has a big name voice cast and they also do a decent, if standard job. No one disgraces themselves. Cage is an unusual choice, but he gives a strong performance. There is only one time when Cage is let off the handle; Unfortunately, that is when we are experiencing the most modernism the movie has to offer.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Wouldn't rave about it,The animation was spectacular and breath taking in some parts but the animals they used didn't make it feel like it was the stone age. There was some funny bits but it felt like they where too far apart to keep it interesting. And some where a little too bit adult for the young audience it was targeting. I took my 2.8 year old and she got bored with it half way through and usually if its a good movie she will be glued to it from start to finish. I did feel like it dragged on for too long. As soon as the credits rolled we rushed out the door but usually we would stay in case there was an extra. That to me says a lot about the movie,4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Lets just say that this family is different,"The Croods take place many years ago in a prehistoric time that should be like the stone age on planet earth and at the same time it presents creatures, colors and scenery that is not of this earth :) Lets just say that this family is different, they are strange and yet peculiar familiar, they are a good blend of characters and they live in an interesting world.There are great animations, it might not be like a Disney classic or Pixar film, but Dreamworks really hits the spot with this different and sometimes weird family animation film. It is very entertaining and the characters are both charming, likable and sometimes strange, but they fit into the story and experience a lot of new stuff and that keeps you interested and watching all the way.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Too violent and somewhat unclear,"This animation movie tells a story of a family of troglodytes whose cave was destroyed by an earthquake and embarked on the search of a new one led by the family leader and father while the purpose of two young members of the team was to reject the leaders aim and search a life under the sun in open air. The story in itself is not interesting enough and it develops itself through too many violent clashes, tumbles, falls, somersaults and earthquakes most of them unnecessary and even not very funny. Like someone once said about a play written by a novice: it has many good scenes and many original ones but the good ones are not original and the original ones are not good. The most positive feature of this movie is the very imaginative creation of strange, beautiful and fanciful animals that people the scenery. Anyway I have seen much better movies of this kind.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"I expected more, but a decent family movie...","Initial Thoughts:
In preparation for the upcoming ""The Croods: A New Age"" that I plan on watching later this week, I thought I would watch ""The Croods"". Initially, I found the movie very slow and not very methodical. If you have cave people that have been doing this hunting thing for some time. Why are they so unorganized and bad at it? Eventually, once they move on from their destroyed cave and the adventure starts, it gets better, but not by much. The animation is great, but doesn't make up for the weak story. There's a lot of empty space that could've been used more for character, or story development, rather than listening to the constant bickering of the family.Pros:
Best part of the film was not the visuals or the story, but rather the music. The music tied everything together really well. From footstomp cues to the adorable character Belt creating the in-house music for a hunt, it flowed and brought the visuals to life.Cons:
While the visuals weren't out of this world they were definitely better than the story. I think it would've been nice to have more character development rather than the animosity of Grug being constantly pushed on us throughout. There should've been more pull to stay back and play it safe rather than a few lines of ""I object"" and then ""Ok I give in, but still object"". Choose a side and stop with the teeter-totter. Either make him convincingly resist or just make him go with the flow.Overall:
If you're looking for a decent family movie, and don't care about the nitty gritty details, this is it. Maybe, not entirely for young kids (7 & under) as some of the creatures could be a bit scary to them, but for the most part a wholesome movie. Once again the most enjoyable part was the music for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Sweet and Clever little ride,"A sweet, funny, and beautifully animated little adventure- The Croods can definitely be a bit familiar at times, but due to veteran animated director Chris Sanders work on the film, it has just enough to charm for you to ignore it. I've always enjoyed this movie, and found it deeply underrated. Granted, it's not Dreamworks best or anything, but it is far better than what they have produced in more recent years. Since Disney bought Fox, a plan was then settled to sell Dreamworks to Universal Studios, which I believe is the cause of lack in quality and downfall in the studios more recent years. I loved 20th Century Fox producing these films, because they didn't look like anything else. The animation style for The Croods is beautiful, unique, and incredibly grounded. It doesn't try to be cartoony, nor is it overly realistic in anyway, and I really enjoy the look of it. The voice acting rocks in this film, it has a stellar cast, from the brilliant Nicolas Cage, to Emma Stone and Ryan Reynolds. I also deeply enjoyed the character of the Grandma, played by Cloris Leachman who often plays the Grandma in many other projects. The cinematography throughout is quite interesting for an animated flick, and the humor varies on goofy to somewhat dark, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Its entertaining, it has some familiar moments throughout, things other animated films have done, but it makes it original and unique enough through its style and plot devices that it makes for quite an enjoyable time.

Not Clear on the Appeal,"After their cave is destroyed, a caveman family must trek through an unfamiliar fantastical world with the help of an inventive boy (Ryan Reynolds).How ""The Croods"" made it into the final circle of the Academy Awards (while pushing out ""Monsters University"") is a bit of a mystery. Reviews, although generally positive, were mixed and everyone seems to be in agreement this was no ground-breaking animation or top shelf humor. And yet this leads to a cartoon show and a video game...The connection between this story and Plato's allegory of the cave has been pointed out, but it is a loose connection at best. If the allegory is boiled down to the basic (and inaccurate) idea that life is more fulfilling outside of the cave, there is a similarity. But any deeper meaning Plato was trying to offer is completely absent in this film which offers no valuable advice.In fact, some aspects seem to be a step backwards. There are more than a few mother-in-law jokes (we still do those?) and even a subtle anti-feminist message. While early on Eep comes across as a strong female lead, once she meets Guy, she is back in the shadow of a man telling her how to live. What could have been a ""girl power"" film was instead turned into a generic father-reluctantly-gives-daughter-away story.Again, this film should probably not have been nominated and hopefully has no chance of winning an Oscar. Despite a few clever moments (Nicolas Cage's idea rant stands out) this is a forgettable dud.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Refreshing!,"When I first saw this movie in trailers and pictures, I was certainly not a fan of the premise. I am not a huge fan of movies that are set in this era, like Ice Age and several others, but yesterday I wanted to give the movie a chance, and I was pleasantly surprised!The animation is wonderful, and the character and monster designs are very different and surprising. The world they live in is very creative.The movie has a great pace and knows where and how to let the viewer feel different emotions. The movie can be funny or sad, and it works wonderfully.If you were not convinced by the marketing or trailers, do give it a shot. It is very much worth your time.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"All over the place, but decent enough to watch once","The story was all over the place, and it's super, super weird - when every new animal appears we said ""what?!"" out loud.

"Stay in your cave, unless you want to get out!","The Croods was fun to watch, and teaches kids to take risks while instilling reasonable family values along the way. There are many great laughable family moments; but, if you stop and think about what's actually going on, there is little purpose to the characters journey. I'm not a huge fan of Dreamworks storytelling, but this is definitely their worst story.As always, the visuals were risky, hit and miss. Initially, I thought that the characters were very ugly, but after five minutes of seeing them on screen, I was able to enjoy their expressiveness. I had a similar experience with PIXAR's UP... the characters were so weird, but when the acting started, things were fine.All of the animals in the film felt like they were inspired by an acid trip with Dali inside of an 80s airbrush painting. The wild elements were always interesting, but not the best quality.So again, there are lots of unique interesting scenes and creatures here, but it all seems a little unfocused and half realized. There are TONs of great special effects in this animated feature, so if you like nature on a big scale, this might be something for you to focus on while kids enjoy the goofy antics of cave people.If you have nothing better to do, get out of your cave and see this one!",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

Unpretentious and funny,"The start of the film threw me off. Yes, it is a cartoon for children, but I was initially annoyed by the fact that there was no attempt at verisimilitude at all. The creatures were not realistic. Their world is not realistic. The things these cavemen do is not realistic. I would have preferred a film that at least attempted to show us what the world would have been like for these people.The movie seems to have been set during the Great Bottleneck that occurred around the Toba disaster. The Crood is a sort of animalistic Neanderthal-like family that learns key lessons from the apparently more evolved Guy.It bothered me that these cavemen were so....American-sounding, and that they were being used as a vehicle to portray modern American family dynamics.I suppose this animated movie was meant to be seen on a huge screen in 3D; however, I saw it on a very small screen on an airplane.Because of these three things I was sorely tempted to switch to a different movie.However, I stuck it out. Before long I found myself enjoying the comedy, the beauty of some of the animation, and the imaginative portrayal of this ancient world. Cartoons are not supposed to be realistic. Some of the natural scenes depicted reminded me of Avatar. At times the movie is hilarious. This is an unpretentiously fun movie.It struck me that kids in particular would love this film and its simple message that ""Dad's rules may not always be right but Dad is a good guy who in the end will look out for you"". The other themes are that ""rules are made to be broken"" and ""get out of your cave and explore the world"". Probably a useful message for the internet generation.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Touching Ode to Fatherhood,"I honestly did not want to watch ""The Croods."" The ugly title and the crude way the characters were drawn did not really appeal to me. I kept trying to defer it when my kids were asking to watch it. Well, for a lazy Sunday afternoon at the mall like today with nothing specific to do, there was no more excuse or escape for this dad to delay the inevitable.""The Croods"" was about the last Neanderthal caveman family on Earth who were forced to get out of the cave that had kept them safe all these years when the mountains around them began to crumble down. With the help of a young inventive caveman named Guy, they follow the sun and venture into the big wide unknown, seeking to escape the destruction of the world they knew. On this journey, the Crood patriarch Grug faces his biggest dilemma as a father when his established way of keeping his family together and safe is challenged by the ""modern"" ideas of Guy, as well as the shifting continental land masses.It took time for me to get into the groove of the story. The superhuman abilities of the Croods as well as the incredibly strange flora and fauna around them were simply too unbelievable and weird. Once I got that initial resistance out of the way, I not only had a very good time laughing at their hilarious antics, I was also very personally touched by the situation experienced by Grug as head of his family, now facing the ultimate threat for their very existence.The technical excellence of this film is unquestionable. OK, I did not really like how the Croods looked, but hey they ARE cavemen anyhow. However the artwork and cinematography of the world around them was breathtaking. The visual effects, grand or minute, dealing with water, or dust, or tar were so realistic. The voice work by Nicolas Cage for Grug is so good, gruff but sincere. Emma Stone as the rebellious daughter Eep, Ryan Reynolds as Guy and Ms. Cloris Leachman as the grandmother also turn in remarkable work.Like several Dreamworks animated films before this one, namely ""Shrek"", ""How to Train Your Dragon"" and ""Megamind"", I was initially turned off by the non-traditional, OK non-Disney, looks of the artwork. But after hearing much positive word of mouth, I gave them a chance and watched them. Of course, I appreciate them as the excellent films that they are. I now add ""The Croods"" to that list. I should really learn my lesson and stop judging them by the way they look in the trailer.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Delightful Family-Oriented Movie!,"The Croods is actually a very good, family-pleasing DreamWorks animated film that is better than expected because of a well-written story and some excellent voice acting. Who knew that an animated movie about a bunch of prehistoric people would receive an Oscar nomination. Speaking of the animation, the film is also visually impressive as this should be eye candy for everyone. As for the jokes, some are actually quite funny and most of them do not fall flat.Kirk De Macco and Chris Sander's film is about a bunch of prehistoric people named the Croods whom do not like to try new things and they spend the majority of their days holed up in a cave. However the daughter, Eep wants to do things and she runs away from home much to her father's, Grug displeasure and she learns about what will happen. But due to a changing world, the family must leave their cave and venture out in the wilderness to begin a new life.This film has an impressive voice cast. Nicolas Cage finally chooses a good role as of late and does a neat job voicing the concerned, stubborn Grug. Emma Stone shows she can do well in animation as the voice of Eep. Then we have some good voicework from the likes of Ryan Reynolds, Catherine Keener, and Cloris Leachman.Overall, The Croods is much better than anyone could hope for and it's pleasing animated fare for the entire family. The kids will love this, and I think the adults would be pleasantly surprised. Somehow, this film reminds me of Ice Age and I think that is a favorable comparison because I enjoy those films. But thanks to beautiful animation, a good story, excellent voice-acting, and of course from that prehistoric teen angst, we get a very good family film. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Another Modern Stone Age Family,"This film is recommended.The Croods is the perfect example of what is right and what is wrong with the work coming from today's animation studios: stunning visuals and a so-so story.The film begins with a wonderful chase sequence that utilizes the best in state-of-the-art computer animation: fluid movement, strong details, and vivid colors. It always entertains in telling its tale of a prehistoric family and their struggles to survive the end of the world. But its predictability and overall cuteness wears thin. Characters are more caricatures and sketchy stereotypes of a typical family: Grug the domineering father,  Ugga the loving mother, Eep the rebellious teenage daughter, Thunk the lunkhead brother, Sandy the pesky youngest sibling, and Gran the dotty grandma.Once their man-cave is destroyed, they are off on an adventure as they explore the new world disorder. With their journey comes unique surreal creatures and vibrant environments and, of course, a love story as Eep meets that special guy named Guy. But the emphasis is on action, with little time on character development and too much time being spent on each dangerous encounter, followed by another, and then yet another.Yes, there's lots of running around, avoiding the various exciting obstacles in their way. Interest never lags. Fine voice-over work by Nicolas Cage, Emma Stone, Ryan Reynolds, Catherine Keener, and Cloris Leachman add to the fun. The images throughout the film are quite impressive. Were that the thin story would rise to the caliber of visual excellence by its creative team.Still, any animation fan should see this film for its visual strengths and some sly humor that punctuates this adventure saga. Written and directed by Kirk DeMicco and Chris Sanders, The Croods is diverting entertainment that the whole family, especially the young pesky ones, will completely enjoy.

Neither magical nor memorable but fine in an emergency with bored kids,"It's Easter and there's a slew of films to distract your children. If they're very young and you're desperate the current animation, The Croods may get you though 90 minutes of the school break.To be fair, the old man who sat across the aisle from me with his grandchildren bellowed with laughter for much of it. However, he was in the minority (of one) and I'm sure I saw him dribbling. Conversely, my five-year old nephew sat virtually silently throughout and spent some of it with his head on my shoulder. Trust me, he's a great deal more animated every single time he watches Monsters Inc. and the Toy Story canon. I reckon that just about sums up The Croods.The Croods is 'nice' but there's nothing magical or even particularly memorable about it other than it's one of the few films involving Nicholas Cage where he doesn't SHOUT AT US THE WHOLE TIME.After their cave is destroyed, the reluctant Grug (rhymes with slug, hug, bug and any other damn thing the writers can squeeze into the script in their search for a shallow smile) leads his family of cave dwellers out of their dark world into an exciting, colourful land with the object of his daughter's affection, Guy (Ryan Reynolds).That's not just the introduction; that's pretty much it. Grug doesn't think much of his mother-in-law; his son, Thunk (Clark Duke), is a dunce; his daughter, Eep (Emma Stone), wants adventure; and his wife, Ugga (Katherine Keener) is long-suffering. Oh, he has a baby that's more of an animal that the creatures they encounter.There are some pretty moments as the world opens up to them (in a diluted Avatar kind of way), some mild humour, courtesy of a Sloth called Belt and his one, repetitive joke, and a few moments of insipid danger.The emotion is slight, the lessons heavy-handed, obvious and simplistic enough for even the youngest of children to grasp: hiding in darkness bad, walking towards light good, sometimes dad being boring is best. Blah, blah, blah.Don't bother unless you're desperate. But if you are desperate, take a strong coffee and use the time to learn to knit.Better still, take the children out for a long trudge through the woods or a game of rounders and save the cinema treat for Monsters University.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"ha! we call those ""children""","Have you ever heard the story of a circus elephant? It was tethered to a chain in a circus tent and perished in a tragic fire accident. Despite having the ability to break free, it couldn't... Why? Because it considered the tent its world and the chain its fate.Grug Crood, a caveman, is somewhat similar. He views anything 'New' as BAD, 'Different' as BAD, and 'Curiosity' as BAD. He is an overly protective individual.Now, let's delve into the Crood family:
Grug's wife, Ugga, possesses an open-minded perspective.Eep, a curious teenage girl.Thunk, a character with significantly lower intelligence.Gran, Grug's mother-in-law, maintains a laid-back attitude.Anything else? Well, there's 'Guy' from an unknown family who is far more advanced than them. For instance, he has a pet named Belt.Guy is a complete contrast to Grug. He shares stories of a place with multiple suns in the sky, a land of 'Tomorrow.' He inspires them to explore this new world.And now, they don't want to survive but to LIVE......

A pleasant surprise,"I found The Croods to be a pleasant surprise. It exceeded any expectations I had prior to seeing it. Twentieth Century Fox has teamed up with the studio behind How to Train Your Dragon and Shrek, put How to Train Your Dragon director Chris Sanders on the helm along with Kirk De Micco, and come out with this lively, rousing, and highly entertaining work. It doesn't quite rise up the level of Shrek or How to Train Your Dragon (the latter of which is my favorite DreamWorks animated film), but it's definitely one of DreamWorks's better films. It certainly contains the studio's style, and some elements from (and a few references to) a few of its previous films, including the aforementioned Shrek and HTTYD.The Croods tells the story of a caveman family, (yes, you've guessed it) the Croods, the last surviving family in the region in which they live. They live by hiding in their cave most of the time, only going out to hunt. They always play it safe and live in fear, especially of anything new; as the father, Gurg (Nicolas Cage) says, ""Never not be afraid.""The exception to this is Grug's teenage daughter Eep (Emma Stone), who, instead of wanting to play it safe all the time, is willing to take risks and learn new things. Because of this, she is a bit distant from her family. One night she ventures out of the cave and meets a young man named Guy (Ryan Reynolds), who warns her that the world is about to end. Sure enough, an earthquake occurs soon afterward, destroying the Croods' cave (but this is just the beginning). This sends the family on a journey with Guy across an incredible land that they have never experienced, full of fantastic creatures and more, while heading to a mountain where they will supposedly be safe.I honestly cannot think of much to criticize about the film, except maybe a little bit of the plotting, but that's about it. Again, it doesn't live up to How to Train Your Dragon, but it's still good (and it is admittedly a bit better in terms of character development). It is full of clever humor, wit, and energy. The humor is neither too childish nor too adult. The film also contains true emotion and good, valuable morals. And it is absolutely full of heart. The animation is excellent; colorful, lively, and dazzling. And I want to give a major thumbs-up to Alan Silvestri for the score, which is lively and rousing, just like everything else about the film.Another especially noteworthy aspect of the film is Eep. Strong female protagonists seem to be fairly popular these days, and Eep is no exception. All of the characters shine, not completely dominating any of the others, but she does shine a bit more than the others. Her appearance brought to mind Fiona from Shrek (which is not surprising, as the same studio is behind them both). She is strong, bold, daring, and rebellious, and her personality recalls that of the aforementioned Fiona, Astrid from HTTYD, and even a bit of Merida from Brave. And yes, there is definitely a bit of Astrid in her; just look at the way she treats Guy when she first meets him. However, they do eventually develop some feelings for each other (which Grug is not too happy about). Eep and all of the other character of the film are lovable, as are the interactions and family values, dynamics, and bonding. The voice performances are good too.From beginning to end, there was not a single moment anywhere in the entire film where I was bored. Again, it's not great, but it is good. It is a clever, witty, humorous, energetic, rousing, heartwarming delight, and I hope it gets nominated for the Best Animated Film Oscar. I will not be surprised if it becomes a childhood classic for future generations. I even stayed for the credits. And its primary moral message is one that anybody can relate to: don't let your life get stale – go out and learn and experience new things, live up to your potential, and really live your life and dreams.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Stop reading reviews and GO WATCH THIS MOVIE ALREADY!!!,"O.K, so I'm past that age where animated movies are supposed to excite you. I still manage to see most of them but just not with the same zeal as a younger person would; the jokes seem a bit juvenile, the comedy more slapstick than stimulating and try as I might, I can't be bothered to care for a cartoon character as I would if it were being played by an actual person. That being said, this one took me completely by surprise. The characters were played by the leads to a tee. Nicholas Cage as the overprotective control freak of a father, Ryan Reynolds as the easily spooked outsider who shows the Croods how to use their brains instead of brawn and Emma Stone as the high-spirited youngster with an inquisitive mind and a fierce determination all played their parts to perfection. The story is engaging, the dialogues will make you laugh out loud more than once and to top it all off, the cinematography and art direction is out of this world. I had to pause the movie mid-scene, and come online to write this review just because of one shot where the light goes out and the sky is shown to be lit up with a thousand stars......it's that breathtaking.

Lack of creativity,"""Anything new is bad. Curiosity is bad. Going out at night is bad. Basically, anything fun is bad. Welcome to my world! But this is a story about how all that changed in an instant.""The Croods is one of those animated films that kids will love, but adults will barely find amusing. Kids will pretty much enjoy anything, even co-director Kirk De Micco's previous film Space Chimps. I on the other hand was completely disappointed with this film considering the other co-director involved here was Chris Sanders, who brought us the highly acclaimed How to Train Your Dragon (now that is a sequel I'm really looking forward to). I didn't have a problem with the visuals here, because they were great, but my major issue with this film had to do with the story. The Croods suffers from a completely formulaic narrative where you have the young daughter wanting to go out and experiencing life, while the over protective father doesn't allow it. Last year's Pixar film, Brave, dealt with this very same issue and I personally feel a bit tired of it. These animated films have a history of putting up children against their parents and always giving them the reason. Usually it's the parent that has to change his ways and learn the lesson from their younger child. I understand that this is what is appealing to kids, but pretty much every film targeted towards them is appealing (they won't even hesitate to watch The Smurfs movies again). I am used to these clichéd stories and usually forgive them if the film has clever characters with funny dialogues, but The Croods has neither. I don't remember laughing at any scene, and I don't think any of these characters is really memorable.The story focuses on a family of cavemen whose patriarch, Grug (Nicolas Cage) has kept everyone safe thanks to his extreme rules. He has shielded them from the outside world and kept them inside the cave for most of their lives, only abandoning the cave to collect some food for a few minutes every three or four days. Grug lives with his partner Ugga (Catherine Keener) and her mother Gran (Cloris Leachman). They have two kids: Eep (Emma Stone) and Thunk (Clark Duke), and a young baby. Everyone seems content with Grug's rules, except for Eep who is desperate to explore the outside world. One night after following a strange light out of her cave she runs into a nomad named Guy (Ryan Reynolds) who has discovered how to make fire. Guy is an inventive individual who has managed to survive in the outside world on his own. He warns Eep that the world is coming to an end and that they should head to the high lands. When Grug sees that Eep is missing they immediately go find her and bring her back to the cave, but before they can arrive Guy's predictions come true. Now the entire family will have to embark on a journey with Guy and discover a whole new world while facing the threats in the outdoors.There are several interesting action scenes in The Croods and some beautiful visuals (although nothing as near as beautiful as Pixar's Brave) as they explore and are in awe of this new world. None of the characters here are developed very well and most of the film centers around Grug and Eep. The story does begin to pick up with the introduction of Guy who reminds us of the power of new ideas and the importance of being creative. Unfortunately the film isn't creative with its narrative and that is what left me disappointed. The vocals here were done pretty well with Nicolas Cage, Ryan Reynolds, and Emma Stone standing out mostly because their characters are basically the only ones who have much screen time. The Croods isn't a film the entire family will enjoy, but I am sure the kids will have a blast because it involves outdoor exploration and has plenty of action. I was expecting this film to be a lot funnier, but nothing really stands out.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Awesome!,Some people will never be pleased. Ahem especially grown ups. Its funny cute and brilliantly colorful. Animators get better and better with every film they make and you can feel the passion and love in this film. There is so much tenderness and meaning in this film. The play on a eco modern family (all the way back in the cave people days) is too funny.

Interesting traits from stone age to be used in a great animation movie? They got them all!,"One more masterwork by DreamWorks! I don't know why, but I did not expect too much of this piece. Though, it showed itself a huge good surprise! As I told in the title above, they had many nice ideas about how to use stone age traits to make a great animation movie. The characters are very well developed and I loved their stone-age mannerisms: amazing animation job! Besides that, it has a quite smart screenplay. The general idea may be perceived as a self-help advise not to be afraid and to risk. Though, it it is more than that, or at least it shows a brilliant metaphor for that: humanity only has evolved because human beings overcame their afraid of nature and tried. Screenplay also explores the alpha male struggles, domestication of wildlife, dangers and scarcity faced by the first days of our species. Following the light is also a nice metaphor for knowledge, like the fire of Prometheus. The Noah's moment in the end was also great.

Eventually all his directorial ventures has a co-director and he has co-written with each of them.This movie set in the pre-historic era is about The Croods, the last of cavemen who've survived all the catastrophes just by staying within a cave and how they turn to be the first modern family of a new era. They are a family of six lead by an overprotective dad Grug (Nicholas Cage). We have Eep the daughter who is chunky and one cannot digest the fact that Emma Stone has given the voice for her. One day Eep meets a scrawny boy called Guy (Ryan Renolds) who tells her about the end of the world, which he very fittingly calls ""The End"". The crux of the story happens when the family meets Guy and how he takes them on an exodus to the land of tomorrow.The landscape which The Croods pass by is like Pandora without the fifty shades of blue. The animals in the movie makes one think which weird cross breeding would have created them. An elephantish rat, a mammoth with the skin texture of a giraffe, a bat with pig's face and I let you to imagine the rest. The most adorable creature will be Belt (Chris Sanders) who is Guy's pet, navigator, and belt (Yeah that's how he got the name), you should listen to him saying ""Dan dan daaaah"" which means ""The End"" in his language.Grug's a strong man who's in charge of the safety of the family and at the same time he likes to see his mother-in-law dead. He's the last of the surviving cavemen and who lives to save his clan by keeping themselves away from calamities. Eep the daughter is always fascinated by new stuffs while the entire family believes anything new is dangerous. Guy the hippie is actually a brainy boy who along with his sidekick Belt comes with new ideas at the time of danger. The rest of the cast add to the fun here and there, among them the Gran (Mom-in-law) and Sandy (Younger daughter) are to be specifically mentioned.We all love movies which involves a journey, don't we ? Similarly this is like the coolest disaster movie one would witness with a plethora of scenes to keep you interested. Though the script is sloppy with illogical and clichéd scenes, the comedy saves it from a drag, specially when all the animals close their ears when they couldn't bear the chatter of the cavies passing by the forest, even the subtlest of comedies will leave one chuckling. As an adult if you let your inner child to experience the movie you'll have a fun time lost in the Chug, I name it because it rhymes with Grug (Watch the movie to know about it ;))",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Best Movie ever for ""KIDS""","My daughter and I just love this movie.. I tend to watch all the new animated movies that come out nowadays. It's simply amazing to watch each new advancement with each new movie. The Croods truly was enjoyable to watch, all the details and small touches made it a wonderful show. Just the right amount of humor and seriousness, with a strong love interest. It's everything I was looking for in a movie. The character,Grug himself, voiced with Nicolas Cage makes him seriously a concern father trying to provide for his family, how can we not love Gran trying her best to live another day?

A fun prehistoric animation,"The Croods are a prehistoric family who live in a cave. Grug, the father, teaches his family that the new and unfamiliar is to be feared... along with just about everything else. His daughter Eep is curious though. One night she sneaks out of the cave and meets a boy she hasn't seen before. He is Guy and he tells her how there is going to be a cataclysm and if they are too survive they must head to the distant mountains. When Grug learns of this he just wants to retreat to the cave; however events force them to follow guy. As they journey they travel through new landscapes, meet new dangers and learn not to be afraid of everything.This animation from Dreamworks is a lot of fun. The world it is set in is full of interesting and beautifully rendered creatures and features impressive 3D animation. The story is simple and the threats aren't too scary so it can be enjoyed by all ages. Similarly the gags are aimed at everybody rather than having references that only adults will understand. The characters are fun, have a good interpersonal dynamic and well designed. The cast, which includes Nick Cage, Emma Stone and Ryan Reynolds do a fine job bringing them to life. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of animation, whatever their ages.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Beautifully animated, but obnoxious and manic like a kid on caffine","Easily The Croods best asset is in it's art direction and animation. The creatures are creative and the character designs are unique and memorable. Unfortunately that's where my praise stops as everything the animation is in service of is so fast paced and lacking in any focus it becomes exhausting. Once the movie begins it does not stop, it keeps movie with virtually no rests and that is not a good thing. There are some interesting ideas here, but those are most likely just brief glimpses of what might've been had Aardman been allowed to go with their original concept of this being a buddy comedy between a Luddite and inventor. If you want to see this type of concept done well, just watch Early Man, it's not perfect but at least it doesn't feel the need to pass off constant unrelenting noise as entertainment.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

Nicholas cage was just Nicholas cage. you could totally tell it was him. as for Ryan Reynolds he did a very good job as guy. yes a guy named guy... go figure. this movie definitely deserves its reputation as the animated avatar. my suggestion. you have to see it. its a great time for family.,8.0,Anonymous,Animation

There may even be another movie after the second film I think it watched without boring.Both fun and action at times funny a movie that's almost beautiful enough to cry in some scenes.

Really reminded me of 'THE FLINTSTONES'.,"'THE CROODS': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Blockbuster DreamWorks Animation film about a family of cavemen venturing outside their cave for the first time. It stars the voices of Nicolas Cage, Ryan Reynolds, Emma Stone, Catherine Keener, Clark Duke and Cloris Leachman. It was directed and co-written (with actor John Cleese) by Chris Sanders (who also does a voice in the film) and Kirk De Micco. Sanders is also famous for co-directing such animated blockbusters as 'HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON' and 'LILO & STITCH' (which he also voiced the title character Stitch in). He also co-wrote those films as well as 'THE LION KING', 'ALADDIN', 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST', 'MULAN' and others. This film doesn't quite live up to most others on Sanders' resume but it is a decent animated kids' film.The movie follows a family (the 'Croods') living in the fictional prehistoric time known as the 'Croodaceous' period. The time was populated by a lot of fantastical creatures and a very small amount of humans. The Croods were lead by the father, Grug (Cage), who was obsessed with never letting his family do anything dangerous or try anything new (and kept them mostly hidden in a cave). This drove his teenage daughter Eep (Stone) crazy, who constantly dreamt of adventures. One day Eep does venture outside the cave and meets a very intelligent young man named Guy (Reynolds). The rest of the family goes out looking for her when their cave is destroyed. The Croods then must travel across the land, with Guy as a guide, in search of a new home and safety.The film is colorful and visually pleasant. It's also funny and adventurous at times. All of the cast is more than adequate in the film (especially Cage in the lead). What it really reminded me of was 'THE FLINTSTONES', with Cage playing a character very similar to 'Fred Flintstone'. I grew up on that show so the movie is mildly entertaining to me. If you enjoyed that cartoon you'll probably enjoy this movie as well (and kids will probably love it). It's nothing spectacular but it is decent family entertainment.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/jrx8UNvoGB0",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

MUST see it in 3D!!,"In the last 5 or so years, we've taken our kids to see a lot of 3D animation movies. None of which they really cared for (the 3D part, anyway). So usually when I ask them if they want to see something in 3D or ""regular"" they choose ""regular"". Today happened to be our last day of spring break and they only had one showing of The Croods during the day...which was in 3D. So I figured we'd give it a shot and hope for the best. I am SOOOO glad we did. This is the first time that I honestly feel the 3D really added a LOT to the movie. Generally I just find it to be an annoyance (wearing the glasses and keeping the kids from touching theirs with buttery popcorn fingers) with a few ""oohs"" and ""aahs"" thrown in. But I honestly can't imagine seeing this any way other than in 3D (we'll probably buy it and it just won't be the same at home). There were so many times that my kids and all the ones around us were reaching out to grab things or ducking from things and I'm not gonna lie, I had to stop myself once or twice. I had never seen people react that way before other than Avatar.As far as the movie itself goes, we really enjoyed it. The plot was easy for the kids to follow and kept everyone interested. We laughed through the whole thing and were utterly mesmerized by the colors and the whole experience of this other world on the screen. The scene with the water honestly made me want to jump in through the screen with them. There were also a few times where my eyes were tearing up and I'd look over and my 8 yr old daughter was too (I like when they throw in a little sensitivity). It's a great movie for dads and daughters and I was really kind of sad that we went when my husband was at work. All 3 of my kids (4, 6 & 8) loved it and kept thanking me for taking them to see it. The only other time they were that in love with a movie was Brave. There were maybe 1 or 2 times in the movie that I felt sort of ""meh"" about, but the rest of the movie more than made up for it. I'm actually kind of hoping they make a second one and that's saying something because I usually HATE sequels. All in all, I would highly recommend this movie to families looking for a fun couple of hours.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

A miss fire from my view,"The Croods can be said to have come out a little crude, I felt it was too rough around the edges and the Midas touch of Chris Sanders (which showed up in Lilo & Stich (2002) and he is the man behind the Bolt (2008) story before he left Disney and joined Dreamworks to make the masterpiece How To Train Your Dragon (2010), which he will also be involved in the later sequels of it) is losing its touch after all.It is not that The Croods didn't have the family fun package because it did and it also had the whole family warmth that I expected from an animation targeted at young audience, but the movie was just too primitive, they went overboard with the whole caveman idea, I actually got tired of the stone age, something The Flintstones have not been able to achieve. The movie has many fast paced scenes, a lot of action (adventure) to make you sit up and not be bored, but at the end, it felt weak in the area of emotional sentiment something Pixar has mastered, which makes the characters memorable. The CGI was OK, but the movie also showed lack in the area of the character development, I actually didn't see any reason to like anybody I saw on the screen.The plot is about change and people's failure to accept it. The Croods are a caveman family that has managed to survive the harsh conditions that they live in, only because they believe that to be curious or to desire change is to desire death. But things changed when another Stone Age man passes by their cave, he is more advanced than they are and he knows how to make fire. Now The Croods have a problem, this man tells them it is time to move because where they are, is going to be gone soon as climatic changes are affecting the earth's crust. But The Croods don't want to move, except for one, she happens to have developed feelings for the young genius and propels the family to follow him.The Croods is the first animation film from DreamWorks Animation to be distributed by 20th Century Fox, since the end of their distribution deal with Paramount Pictures in 2012 with Rise of the Guardians.My take on this movie is that, it could have been better but it isn't. The Croods is a family movie nothing more or spectacular I don't see this having an Oscar nomination.www.lagsreviews.com",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
A feel-good family movie.,"Certainly a feel-good movie, The Croods tells the tale of a Cave Family and their struggle to survive the continental drift. What I found most interesting about this animated film is the fact that, while there was a love interest, that was not the focus of the movie. For me that was a selling point. It is refreshing to see a story in which the main focus is a family connection, more specifically, between a father and daughter. Another great selling point is the animal creations, from meat eating bird flock to a multipurpose sloth, each creature and plant is unique and original. I also have to add how cute I found all of the animals, except maybe the ""Piranhakeets"". Those freaked me out. The relationship between Grug and Eep is one that I think most of us can relate to. A protective father and a rebel teenage daughter is nothing new, but when you add a prehistoric set it definitely seems that way. Furthermore, the ideas of shoes and hugs that Guy and Grug come up with bring a dash of comedy to the movie that I found delightful. The aerial shot of the environment are breath taking, particularly in the way they are so colourful and paradisaic. This movie certainly left me wanting more, and I recommend it to anyone who has not yet watched it. If you like animated movies this is a good one.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Simply Amazing,"This movie was fantastic, I bought it to watch with my friends in college and we were all laughing hysterically at the clever jokes throughout the movie.

Refreshing Avatar vs Croods,At first when i read the synopsis on this movie I thought this was just another animation without a great story line with the same old jokes being used again. I was pleasantly surprised when i found out that - From beginning until the end this movie had everything - refreshing comical lines with great humor both for young ones as well as adults watching to the impressive imaginative graphics and ideas. I would like to compare this to be the animated version of Avatar. Definitely one of the best animated movies i have seen for a long time.

The Peter Jackson's Avatar of kids movies in the worst ways possible.,"How can anyone like this pile of uneducated garbage!!! I think people are just too blown away by the animation ( which is this movies only strong point. Seriously, this is Dreamworks' greatest animation since How to Train Your Dragons!) that they don't notice that it is literally a movie done a million times!!! Yes folks, this is the ""paranoid parent doesn't want to let his daughter go/ road trip"" movie. Nicholas Cage is OK in this movie, but all I hear is Nic Cage being NIC CAGE! Emma Stone is also a good actress, but I can't say that this is the best film of her career. That being said, it's not the worst film she has been in either. But I'm getting ahead of myself. The one thing that this movie is is UNGODLY FORGETTABLE!!! I can't remember ONE LINE OF DIALOGUE and the comedy is too much slapstick and not a lot of anything else, that the jokes are just as forgettable as the dialogue. Quite literally, this movie is THE AVATAR OF ANIMATED BOX OFFICE MOVIES. It has good actors that don't do as good in the movie as they should, like Avatar. It's visual style is much more memorable than the actual plot, like Avatar. The story is a mix of clichés, like Avatar! It's just Avatar made for kids! Unless you want to see a movie to riff and make fun of, or if you want to see Avatar 2 before they release it in theaters, I wouldn't touch this movie at all!!!",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Excellent Family Movie!,"I just purchased the movie ""The Croods"" last week for my six year old daughter. She absolutely loved it, and so did I. The story line was fantastic and full of action that kept my daughter and I intrigued and laughing throughout the entire movie. I felt that this movie was casted perfectly. It had a lot of my favorite actors such as Nicolas Cage, Cloris Leechman, and Emma Stone. I think they all did a fabulous job as the characters. I like that this movie captures real-life family aspects. Obviously, it is a make believe setting and story line, but it still felt like the family dealt with every day family issues like the ""stubborn teenage daughter"" and the ""over-protective father."" This movie was definitely fun filled with laughter. It is one of our new family favorites. I would definitely recommend anyone to see this movie. It truly is enjoyable for all ages.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Caveman Vs. Fire - Or - Slapstick Metaphor,"Expectations were relatively high for 'The Croods' knowing that the script was based on a John Cleese story. Sadly, this movie fell short of anything remotely resembling a Monty Python sketch.The story itself was thinly veiled metaphor for humanity's progression from simple cave-folk to the age of enlightened reason. The jokes (if you can call them that) relied heavily on physical comedy and there weren't any gags that haven't been done before.There was a lot of unmet potential in the story to be more of a suspenseful adventure story with a strong female lead. Instead, we're rushed through various fantastic landscapes for reasons that were only vaguely described while the writer beat us over the head with how stubborn and resistant to change the father, Grug was compared to the lively and talented Guy. Never once do we find out where Guy received his knowledge; apparently it all came to him spontaneously including how to make fire.Sure, it's a ""kids movie"" but it's always nice to see a little more substance, especially when a legend like John Cleese has his name attached to the project.The animation was top notch; Dreamworks consistently has better animation (and movies) than Pixar and there's no sign that this will change any time soon. If you have young children then this is a good movie for pure childish entertainment value but noting more than that.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
After ICE AGE now it's time to explore into STONE AGE,"So far the best animation of 2013. After 'Ice Age' now it's time to explore into another world 'Stone Age'. It was the story of a caveman family that is set in the time of the stone age. I never thought the Nicolas Case suit for an animation character, I am surprised, he was the best and his voice perfectly synced with one.According to the movie everything were not logic in the movie and one should not be bothered about it. The species that comes in the movie were fused with each other and kinda worked for the story. The movie was simply enjoyable, I had so much fun, the Crood family was awesome. The story was very simple, it was all about adventurous journey of a family to escape the disaster.You know teenage daughter and her over caring father never compromise for anything in life. In this movie they always fight each others, one of parenting rights and other for the freedom to experience new stuffs. Like most of the story, boy meets girl here too two young people meet but kinda fairly avoided the romance. Of course there will be always one geek brother and a annoying little sister and a disgusting granny and a mother who always listens to her hubby.In those I have seen 2013s animated movies it was the best pick, many are yet to release. A movie can be enjoyed with family and kids. A must see for animation movie fans and I highly recommend it.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Feels like it was written back in the stone age,"""The Croods"" is a 2013 DreamWorks animated film. It is about a stone age family named the Croods as they have to find a new home. Ryan Renolds voices Guy, a forward-thinking caveman who has strange new ideas. There is the typical family drama between the father and daughter. The father, Grug, voiced by Nic Cage, wants his daughter to stick with the old safe ways. The daughter, Eep, voiced by Emma Stone, wants to go out in the world and try new things. What ensues is a very less focused Finding Nemo type theme about knowing when to let you children go out on their own.This film is a bit all over the place. It has both too much going on, when at the same time feeling like nothing is happening. The POV character shifts part way through the story from being about Eep, to being about Grug.Most of the jokes are pretty basic low hanging fruit. A lot of slapstick, a lot of stone age things being used for modern inventions, all very Flintstone-esque stuff. The animation and music all do their job fine, but it is nothing all that special. You may note that's a running theme with this review: ""Nothing special"". None of the characters are annoying, and none of the jokes are awful. It is just a very basic animated movie.What can you say except...ugg.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

Anti-religious Propaganda?,"Not since the very funny Ricky Gervais' very unfunny ""The Invention of Lying"" has a film had such a pervasive anti-religious agenda. Grug keeps his family safe by following the ancient teaching on the cave wall - the doxology if you will. They follow precisely a prescribed set of rituals draw from this dogma which keeps them nourished. However, one day Guy appears and seduces the teenage Eep (it sounds like ""Eve"" in the movie) by bringing her fire. This makes him the light-bringer - the literal definition of Lucifer. Grug's family follows Eep as Guy introduces other forms of formerly forbidden knowledge until they all abandon the old ways in favor of this more secular existence. In keeping of the agenda of the producers, everything works out for them because of these changes. Well, at least that's one way to interpret it. Another is to say this is largely a decent but forgettable popcorn animated movie long on visuals and short on writing much like ""Kung Fu Panda."" Certainly the film has some exciting moments and decent lines but by about the twelfth time someone is chased by a non-extinct large cat, it gets a little monotonousness. Casting choice aimed toward box office so you wind up with off putting and slightly crazed action star Nicolas Cage voicing the put-upon father with a heart of gold. Even in the tender moments you wonder when Grug is going to go all twitchy and spout the tenants of a conspiracy theory or pull out an exotic handgun. In short, atheist activists and Satanists will love the film, people with kids will appreciate that it takes up an hour and half.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Not great but entertaining enough to recommend to parents.,"A good kid movie, but not so good for adults. Again I watched this with my fiancé who loves animated movies and although it had its funny moments, I was bored for most of the movie. The basic moral of the story is to not keep your head in the sand. Traditions are not always good, and education is important else you will become obsolete and it can hurt you in the long run. I found the grandma relationship with the husband to be somewhat funny as was some of the cave dweller behaviors. Aside from that however, I thought the execution was a little bland. If you have kids, this is a good movie though I really wouldn't want my kids to assume that falling in love is how it was portrayed in this movie and others. I really think that animated movies need to stop pushing the idea that liking someone after 2 minutes is somehow ""love."" I see too many people falling into this trap at an adult age and now in my mid 30s I am seeing all those relationships fall apart some in very ugly ways. We really should not encourage this type of behavior... anyway, gripe about absurd love aside, the movie was OK.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Downright AWESOME!,"I actually loved the trailers and couldn't wait to see this movie. Though in the past many trailers have been top notch but the movie just didn't match up. Well in the case of the Croods, the trailers were nice but the movie was just a great, brilliant and amazing feat.The animation quality is brilliant, excellent animation that is enchanting and magical. The story very moving and heartfelt and had some really emotional and moving scenes handled very intelligently. The characters are endearing and you just can't help but love them all, absolutely lovable. This action packed adventure is just an epic and thrilling ride GUARANTEED to keep you (child and adult) at the edge of your seat. Breathtaking visuals and heart racing scenes. An adventure of a lifetime is all i can say. Spectacular and fun. The entire family dynamic of The Croods is so amazingly portrayed and extremely ratable. With educational snippets guaranteed to get kids interested in topics such as plate tectonics and continental shift and drift etc. And many heartwarming and yet smartly handled lessons to be learned along the way. What a great film.Now for the humor. It is brilliant, smart humor that will have you in stitches. I have not laughed that hard in a long long time. I laughed until i cried and no i am not exaggerating. The entire theater was in stitches booming with laughter. It was just great fun. The child in the row ahead of me commented to his mother how he was loving this amazing movie to which his mother replied that she too thought it was awesome! The college kids who came as a group were in hysterics and seemed to enjoy this movie just as much. Even a grandmother who sat next to me couldn't control herself and was enjoying this great family film with the rest of us. To put it plainly, the whole family will love it. It is the perfect family movie: smart, hilarious, sweet and emotional. And whats great is you will enjoy it even if you go on your own. So many individuals came to watch it on their own and they enjoyed it as much as the families did. Usually many comedy movies will have a chuckle here and there but this one had myself and the rest of the audience in fits of uncontrollable laughter from start till finish. One of those films where time just flies by and since you are thoroughly enjoying yourself, you just don't notice the time pass.GREAT WORK DREAMWORKS! They really are stepping it up as of late. ROTG was fantastic and now this film is carrying on the trend of brilliant animated films. Looking forward Dreamworks Studios next endeavor and if this film is anything to go by, i see many more great films ahead from this studio.Though if you are dumbed down and go for films which are historically accurate because you are too lazy to do the research on your own or have no imagination and are incapable of appreciating great fiction, well you can skip it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Chix Chat on Film review: Thinking outside the cave.,"I was excited about seeing The Croods, because my grandchildren are visiting and I figured it would be a nice little treat for them. We decided to try it out in 3-D since the colors looked so vivid in the trailer. This turned out to be a very bad idea, as soon as we placed the glasses on the youngest he started screaming and buried his face in his mom's chest, the older one refused to wear the glasses so he watched the entire movie out of phase. The appearance of the landscape and the exotic animals was striking because the colors were so vivid. The 3-D special effects continue to impress me as they evolve and enhance the movie going experience, there were moments when it seemed that you could reach out and touch what was taking place on screen, which is apparently what frightened the little ones. It was an interesting concept to apply current events to a family that starts out in fear and darkness dwelling in a cave for survival and having a rebellious teenaged daughter shed some light on the fact that it is time for change. I was surprised that the story even played out a road trip replete with, 'are we there yet' so as to show a relatable family. I assumed from the name that the Croods was a play on words and that they would be well, crude. Gold star for Emma (me, but Emma Stone (Eep) can have one too), they were very crude but were also quick studies. This was a very smart story in that when they knew better they did better. There was nothing in the story that was especially original, but the handling of the themes was refreshing, like the overprotective father, the dysfunctional relationship with the mother in law and the coming of age story for Eep (Emma Stone) .The alpha male competitiveness was fun to watch between Grug (Nicholas Cage) and Guy (Ryan Reynolds), who was an advanced thinker and master puppeteer. In all this was a very entertaining film with some clever word plays, there were times that it strayed from the prehistoric age and got a bit too modern like with the umbrellas, but the belt was really cute. It's a good film for both children and adults, however I think the best fit for children is sans the 3-D. I give it a green light.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

The creators have put up a good idea and it teaches us a lesson too no matter how old you are,which is what, I will not spoil for those who have not watched it yet.From of the cute ""owws"" from the girls behind our seats,I have to admin that there were very cute moments in it.Worth watching, 3D would be better.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good solid fun,"Yes, it is formulaic. But, at no point in the movie was I bored. Everyone in the family, from a 6 year old to a 46 year old enjoyed the movie and was entertained. Is it an instant classic, no, but I think is should be getting more attention than is appears to get.Don't bother paying for the 3D. It didn't add much in my opinion. I didn't have a choice (2D wasn't offered at my theater). The kids liked it, I felt it either wasn't noticeable or got in the way.My other complaint is admittedly... sort of silly. The animals in the movie were all fantastical, like the animators were trying to out do each other on who would invent the weirdest creature. I think they should have used real species from the period. Sagan used to call Star Trek a ""missed opportunity"" to show real science, I feel the same way about this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Funny and light way to talk about deep mankind questions,"This movie is more than just entertainment. Don´t be fooled by the worn out caveman theme, or because it´s an animation. This is not The Flintstones or else. It´s a fun and original story that tells more than it appears to tell. 
This movie is about deep questions of mankind, especially how we deal with knowledge, how we learn things, how we resist to change, the role of fear in our survival etc.
There´s a lot of science in it, in a fun and light way. Evolutionary theory, psychology, sociology, even it suggests the origin of football, as they go hunt for an egg. Well, this is an underrated movie, that lost the Oscar award to Frozen.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Modern Stone Age Family Falls Shy of Expectations,"A different take on the ""modern stone age family"". A stay-in-the-safety-of-the-cave family, the last of the cavemen, are forced to abandon familiar surroundings when the end of their world begins (Pangea breaking into continents). I feel this is one of the films that put the majority of the good parts in the trailer. It's not very original, the voice cast is a bit meh, the pacing is so-so, and though it has it's moments, it's really not that fun, or at least not the fun I've come to expect from DreamWorks series of animated family films. One of the good parts are the animals they encounter, often prehistoric hybrids of modern times creatures like the Piranhakeets and Mousephants. Fine Saturday afternoon kiddie fare, but falls short of expectations. 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Fun, well-acted, beautifully animated movie with a nice central message","The Croods was so much more fun than I expected, especially once I realized that the concept of physics was completely thrown aside and characters could easily survive being dropped from incredible heights, having boulders land on them, being chased down by much larger beasts, etc. I was able to just sit back and enjoy the film and its central story.As others have pointed out this movie is a nice change of pace when it comes to character design, especially that of Eep. Rather than going the typical route and designing her with an hourglass figure the designers thought about how these cave people move and emphasized their stocky, muscular build and their upper body strength is reflected in their large torsos and thick arms. I really love the design of Eep, particularly her facial expressions reflecting her curiosity, sense of wonder, and intelligence. Guy was also a wonderful character, very sweet, charming, and funny especially in his interactions with Eep and her father.The voice acting was excellent - each actor very much matched their characters.I also enjoyed the fantastical designs of the creatures, from the multi-colored macaw/sabre-tooth tiger to the little elephant mice.There is a particular point in the movie when the scenery completely changes and it made me sit up and realize the beauty of this particular world. I can't say how realistic any of this world is but it sure is lovely to look at and imagine surviving/living there.As an adult watching this film I felt that some of the jokes were aimed at an older audience, like the running gag about Grug wishing for his mother-in-law to die off. This gag was amusing at first but I feel like they took it a bit too far at one point in the film. Also I didn't like how Eep's brother taught his new ""pet"" to roll over and it rolls right off the cliff and the brother treats it as a joke. I didn't think this was amusing at all but am glad the film took the time to show that the pet survived.All in all, I very much enjoyed The Croods and would gladly rewatch it and consider watching other films/projects within the franchise.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Great Animated Film,"An animated masterpiece, The Croods is a great film and another masterpiece from Dreamworks Animation. The Croods is a family of cavepeople whose eldest daughter, Eep, tires of her father's rules that has kept them alive while their neighbors were either eaten or died from illness. However, one night, seeing a fire, Eep breaks her father's rule and goes out, meeting with Guy, a caveboy who is actually intelligent, and warns her the world is ending. When the family cave is destroyed, The Croods must go the the mountains, with Eep's father, Grug, soon developing a rivalry with Guy, whose inventions and positive attitude soon win over the rest of the family.The movie is nice. The designs of the enviroment is very beatiful, and the characters look well. Also, they get some good stars, like Nicolas Cage as Grug, Ryan Reynolds as Guy, and Emma Stone as Eep, and they do a good job.

Excuse me while I think about being princess carried by Eep.,"At last another stone age animation comes along and of course the theme is the fear of modernity and creative solutions.It's actually highly enjoyable, even relative to its studio as they create a world reminiscent of ours but incredibly new in its fauna, flora and general topology to give us a sense of alienation and wonder comparable to our primeval, but not too primitive family.Seriously, some of the inventiveness with these kooky animals could carry the movie by itself with tons of witty visual gags based on misdirection which almost always work.It's hard not to like Eep (pronounced ""IIP""): not only for the not-so-gentle femdom dynamic she has with their newish-age hostage (held against his will for a large part of the movie I might add) but she embodies a desire for more. The opening narration lays this on a bit thick, it must be said.But though Eep does have enough agency to set the plot in motion and appears to be something of the face of the movie, the real main character of this movie is the father. He has the richest character arc as he tries to do right by his family the only way he knows how but must embrace new kinds of solutions to new problems and actually does in his own way before too long.Not unlike Hotel Transylvania, the essence of the conflict is the father and the suitor butting heads over possession of the female who takes pride in her muscle weight (that was refreshing).It is impressive how with limited characters they were able to make such a rich adventure with the main villain really being the internal demons and the elements themselves.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Some puns doesn't seem to make much sense when it comes to the scenarios and characters. Despite the setting taking place in a pre-historic time period, there isn't really anything new. There is a lot of obnoxious wackiness, which is understandable since it's dealing with cavemen. What I did like is how it sticks to the cavemen nature of the characters, while also blending in modern interaction. And I am not just talking about how the characters speak English. It shows the vicious and animal like nature of the characters back then, while also keeping it family friendly. All the voice actors and actresses is alright, again nothing that stands out but for the most part it seems to fit the characters. Nicholas Cage basically 100% sounds like Nicholas Cage. I give credit for the parts near the end, how it connects certain things together. While also bringing out the emotions, although the emotional elements maybe a bit cliché.

Yabba Dabba Don't,"'The Croods' features some truly dazzling animation that really pops out when watched in high definition. It's just a shame that it's wasted on such a lackluster script. Hackneyed, unfocused, and utterly devoid of laughs, the film shambles from one loud bit of nonsense to the next, hoping it seems to club us into submission like the cavemen who inspired it.With so few characters a lot of pressure falls on the shoulders of the small voice cast, who unfortunately prove unable to do anything with the weak material they're given. There isn't a single standout performance or one moderately likable character here.I would hardly call this the golden age of animation, but there are certainly better options out there than this tepid effort.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Lively, thoughtful crowd-pleaser","A Stone Age family of six, The Croods live in a world where life is a nonstop struggle for survival and where anything new is to be feared and avoided at all cost. Or at least that's what young Eep (Emma Stone) has been taught to believe by her well-meaning but over-protective dad, Grug (Nicholas Cage). But Eep is a naturally bright and curious sort, and when she meets a cute boy, Guy, (Ryan Reynolds) living out on his own who's discovered this new-fangled thing called ""fire,"" she makes it her life's mission to start venturing out a bit more on her own. Guy also offers her a more optimistic view of life and the future than she gets from her scaredy-cat dad who prefers to huddle with his family in a tiny cave safe from the threats outside. But when an earthquake destroys the family's cave, they are all forced to hazard out into the big bad scary world of threats by nature and hungry prehistoric predators.Written and directed by Chris Sanders and Kirk DeMicco, ""The Croods"" is lively and fun and built upon the theme of learning to face one's fears and of finding the courage to move on to bigger and better things in spite of the potential dangers lurking along one's path..In addition to the amusing, nicely differentiated family members, there's the customary bevy of cute and cuddly prehistoric creatures (even the threatening ones are kind of cuddly) to make this a fine, non-threatening look at life in prehistoric times, fit even for the more impressionable kiddies.The computer-generated animation is clean, if not exactly envelope-pushing or spectacular, and it makes up in speed what it lacks in sophistication.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Love love love!! Such a funny family !,"Delightful and hilarious animated adventure that takes you on a prehistoric joyride with a quirky family that will warm your heart.

When her curiosity leads her to meet a resourceful and imaginative young man named Guy, voiced by Ryan Reynolds, their worlds collide, quite literally.From the moment Eep and Guy meet, the chemistry between the characters sparks a whirlwind of adventures and laughs. The contrast between the primitive, animalistic Croods and the innovative, forward-thinking Guy is both comedic and heartwarming.The animation in ""The Croods"" is impressive, transporting you to a visually stunning and imaginative prehistoric world. The landscapes are breathtaking, from lush forests to treacherous terrains, and the creatures are wonderfully bizarre and creatively designed.The humor in the film is top-notch, making ""The Croods"" a laugh-out-loud experience for audiences of all ages. The family dynamics and witty interactions between the characters add a charming layer of authenticity to the story.Beyond the laughs, ""The Croods"" delivers a meaningful message about the importance of embracing change and taking risks to thrive. As Eep's family grapples with leaving their comfort zone and adapting to new challenges, the film conveys a beautiful lesson about the strength of family bonds and the power of stepping into the unknown.The movie's action sequences are thrilling and packed with suspense, keeping you engaged throughout their perilous journey. The combination of humor, heart, and adventure strikes the perfect balance, making ""The Croods"" an all-around crowd-pleaser.In my opinion, ""The Croods"" is a heartwarming and feel-good animated gem that stands the test of time.
