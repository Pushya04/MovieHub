My Ultimate Guilty Pleasure- how do you assign a rating to that?,"This movie is my ultimate guilty pleasure. It's inane, manipulative, has hyperactive cutting, a ton of glaring inaccuracies (pointless to even discuss or debate), and probably 29 other glaring faults. And why in every dramatic slow-mo emo shot are there 3 helicopters flying in unison overhead? What's the point of having 3 helicopters flying really close together? Who cares! It looks cool. If one day I am having a heartfelt talk with my daughter, I hope there are 3 helicopters flying overhead to really 'bring it home' (and Aerosmith performing in the background.)Despite it all, I still love watching this movie. Anytime it is on TV I can watch it 'til the end. Bruce Willis does a great job doing his Bruce Willis 'thing' (smart alecky tough guy), and the supporting cast is really great. Steve Buschemi in particular gets the best lines. An awesome assortment of ragtag castoffs (spitting funny one-liners) must save the world- who would have thunk it?I think Armageddon was actually conceived by suits in a studio office (no really, I read that in a magazine), which is I guess another strike against it. Yet only a bunch of suits could come up with a 'high concept' like this (so high it's basically a parody by itself.) And only a director like Michael Bay could make it. He's far more suited to these types of movies, rather than big historical epics like PEARL HARBOR (which I really, really disliked.)I read somewhere once that this movie is as close as Hollywood gets to pure cinema, in that it is basically completely divorced from reality of any kind. Is that good or bad? I don't know. I do think if you're going to ditch convention and any semblance to reality, you may as well go all the way. It's better than having something that is a confused mess that tries to be different things (Pearl Harbor.) There will be no 'it could really happen!' here.So after all this, believe it or not I am going to give this movie a big fat whopping 8. Why? Because IMO it unabashedly succeeds at what it tries to set out to be, whatever that is. That makes no sense, since I am basically saying by all logical accounts this movie may actually suck, yet I am giving it a 8. But hey I loved this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I'm 38. Today I watched this movie first time,"With horrible movies coming out month after month I searched for a good movie. And I found Armageddon on HBO GO and remembered that I never watched this movie in full. So many years after release, I took the time, headphones, 50 inch tv and some popcorn. Let me tell you one thing - THIS IS ONE FANTASTIC MOVIE. They don't make movies like this anymore. We give oscars to crap today, this was pure pleasure and I'm glad I never wathched it before. I always caught part of it. But today, 22 years later hehe :) man, I miss the old movie making skill.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Incredibly unrealistic, but still a fun 2hrs20min","Steam, wind, sound and gravity on an asteroid flying through space? Yeah the director didn't really think this whole 'space thing' through (or I think he simply didn't care... he was just like: ""Meh, let's just make it fun""). And the movie is pretty fun, if you ignore the obvious inconsistencies and plot holes. Just take it like this: It's a movie of Bruce Willis and his team of misfits attempting to save the world by going to outer-space and blowing up a giant asteroid that's hurtling towards earth. PS. Liv Tyler at 21 y/o was unbelievably beautiful... she's distractingly gorgeous in the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of Those Guilty Pleasures,"After discovering that an asteroid the size of Texas is going to impact Earth in less than a month, NASA recruits a misfit team of deep core drillers to save the planet.The real mystery surrounding this film is how it got released by the Criterion Collection. Both this film and Michael Bay's ""The Rock"" received the Criterion treatment at one time. And while both are very enjoyable films, do they really belong with Criterion? I feel that by merely being released by them, there is an added importance stamped on the film.But as far as guilty pleasures go, this is a fun and entertaining film. I could do without the romance angle, but the idea of blowing up an asteroid before it hits earth (which assumes a lot of questionable science) is just classic science fiction, here given more legitimacy and budget than ever before.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Has all the ingredients of a good action movie...,"...that's exactly what this is: an ACTION movie.  It's not supposed to sweep the Oscars, the acting isn't supposed to be perfect, and it's not supposed to make perfect sense.The story follows a group of oil drillers sent by NASA to stop an asteroid that will strike the world in eighteen days.  The drillers are taught and trained to become astronauts (in a very comedic scene) and then sent to the asteroid to drop the nukes and blow it up.  After that, a whole lot goes wrong.I loved this movie, and I hate how everyone's been calling it 'mindless action'.  It's not mindless, it's actually very dramatic.  The acting is great from pretty much all accounts, even Ben Affleck does a good job.Bruce Willis captures the 'reluctant hero' role, and Liv Tyler does well as his daughter.  Steve Buscemi delivers a great comedic performance as the genius who goes insane once they land on the asteroid.Great, funny, intense, dramatic movie.  8/10.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great cast with tons of energy,"Believe it or not, I managed to escape the 1990s without sitting through Armageddon. I'm notoriously squeamish about ""we're all going to die!"" movies, so the only reason I did sit through it was because it was Bruce Willis's week on Hot Toasty Rag. Thankfully, my mom prepped me for it and told me everything that happened so I wouldn't be too scared or sad. So, if you're squeamish like me, and you want to watch it anyway, just ask your mom how it ends.He must have been busy, or didn't want to seem old enough to have a twenty-year-old daughter, but the leading role Bruce Willis took on seemed tailor-made for Kevin Costner. Bruce held his own and wound up making a certain scene one of the most iconic scenes to come out of the '90s. He plays a gruff, tough oil driller with a soft spot for his daughter, Liv Tyler. Liv, raised around gruff, tough friends of her dad, has fallen in love with one of them, and her dad's not happy about it. Liv and Ben Affleck's romance seems a little unimportant when Bruce and his entire crew are called to NASA to save the world.Sure, I'm not a fan of the premise of the movie-a giant asteroid heading for Earth isn't my idea of a good time-but the cast is so delightful it makes everything worth it. Everyone has tons of energy and brings their own presence to the screen. Bruce had his classic combination of machoism mixed with being a softie on the inside. His fellow drillers-turned-astronauts are an eclectic group impossible to dislike. Steve Buscemi has a weakness for women, and his antics are hilarious and remarkably charming. Will Patton has a broken homelife, and he's given a touching scene the night before the rescue mission to reconcile with his family. Michael Clarke Duncan, Owen Wilson, and Ken Campbell aren't really given anything to do besides rattle off one-liners, but the one-liners are funny, so I don't think anyone will complain. Back at NASA, the head of the program and mission is Billy Bob Thornton, and he always brings a little something special to his roles. Keith David, a head honcho from Washington, brings tension and severity to the plot, and Jason Isaacs plays a scientist with good intentions.When Bruce's group is brought to NASA, they have to go through a mini-boot camp to make sure they're physically able to undergo the mission. It's a very funny sequence, started by William Fichtner, who plays the only certified astronaut on the mission, quipping, ""Talk about the wrong stuff!"" when he sees the odd lineup. Bill has a great, meaty role, and he's completely believable as a disciplined, intelligent patriot who's scared yet confident. Peter Stormare puts on yet another accent, Russian this time, and plays a quirky astronaut who's been stationed in space for too long at the expense of his social skills. There are plenty of comic reliefs in this movie, Peter included, to even out the immense tension of the plot. Even though you'll be worrying about the end of the world, you'll be laughing through your fear.Since this is a Michael Bay movie, you can expect overactive camera angles and tons of special effects. The opening sequence is incredible, even when watching it twenty years later, as a meteor shower destroys New York City. There's a lot to appreciate in this movie, with the push and pull of the characters, everyone's special quirks and motivations, and the Oscar-nominated song, ""I Don't Want to Miss a Thing."" The romance between Liv and Ben is really the only downside; it's supposed to be true love and more powerful than the end of the Earth, but it feels like a summer fling between two teenagers. Liv is given many tearjerker scenes throughout the movie, and since she was only twenty years old during the filming, I decided to cut her some slack. I remember the difficulties of being a young actress and how sometimes the emotions you think are being projected in front of the camera don't end up coming across very well. So, when you watch her scenes and she's supposed to be crying over the danger her boyfriend and father are in, keep her age in mind and be kind.To call yourself a true '90s kid, you'll probably want to rent this movie. You'll probably have a good cry during the credits, but if you like these ""we're all going to die!"" movies, you'll probably enjoy yourself during the process. Go ahead and bring your Kleenexes, and enjoy what this very large cast brings to the screen.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie will not be your friend. Since I counted 66 spinning camera shots and 13 canted angles, as well as 4 scenes with strobelights and 6 scenes with a severe shaky camera, you should be aware that this movie could make you seriously sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, since this is an ""end of the world"" movie, I'd wait until my kids were a little older until they watch it.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Fun, Action-packed movie.","This movie seems to be a movie that many people love to hate.  I don't see why it has such a bad reputation.  It is meant to be an Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi movie, and it definitely lives up to this.  It is what it is. Many people have tried to compare it to Apollo 13, but that's like comparing apples and oranges.  They are entirely different fruit. Apollo 13 is based on a true historical event (Docu-drama), while Armageddon is an Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi movie.  It has plenty of action and adventure, a lot of humor, and a bit of romance.  Is the story realistic? Not hardly, but name ANY Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi movie that is.  That's why they call it Science FICTION... For those who criticize this movie, nothing will change their minds. However, if you HAVEN'T seen Armageddon, take a chance, watch with an open mind and try not to let all these negative reviews spoil your enjoyment of a really fun movie.  Remember, a movie is meant to ENTERTAIN, and Armageddon does just that, if you let it!",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I agree that this film is stupid but I was entertained,"After some silly opening narration by Charlton Heston the story starts. According to this an asteroid the size of Texas is going to hit the Earth in 13 days. If it hits it will destroy the entire planet. (I know I know--just go with it) So NASA (led by a slumming Bily Bob Thornton) hires a group of oil drillers (led by Bruce Willis), trains them how to work in outer space, sets them off to drill a hole in the asteroid, set explosives and get the hell out of there...all in 11 days. Also, before the asteroid hits, meteors are coming down and virtually wiping out major cities like New York and Shanghai.As you can see logic disappears pretty quick in this one. Director Michael Bay has said he makes movies for teenage boys. That's no surprise. There's LOTS of explosions here, lots of masculine men fighting each other and a plot dumbed down so anyone can understand it. There's also a hysterically funny ""love"" story between Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler (their goodbye scene using Animal Crackers has become a classic of bad cinema). Despite all this the movie WAS a huge hit. I saw it in a theatre back in 1998. It was a ridiculously stupid movie but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't entertained. It pounds you into submission with some incredible widescreen imagery, LOUD stereo sound and some truly unbelievable special effects. After a while you ignore the stupid story and just sort of go with it. As for characterizations--well who needs that? All of the actors are playing walking, talking clichés. There's not one person that acts like a normal human being. Liv Tyler tries but the script is stacked against her. Also I LOVE how she's allowed to casually stroll around the top secret NASA facility while her father and boyfriend are on the mission! The acting is as good as it can be. Willis delivers his regular one note performance; Thornton doesn't take this seriously for a moment; Tyler tries; Affleck looks lost and Steve Buscemi, Owen Wilson, Will Patton and Michael Clarke Duncan basically hit their marks and say their lines. So this movie is big, loud, stupid and far too long but it WAS entertaining. Just turn off your mind, sit back and watch things blow up. I give it a 7.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"I don't care if it is shallow, i love it","What did everyone expect when this film was released, i expected exactly what i got, stunning visual effects, good surround sound and plenty of action (and yes i expected the traditional dose of sentiment too)This movie is pure escapism fun, which has its place in my collection, movies like Independence Day and Armageddon are great fun to watch and as a bonus the characters weren't bad the script was reasonable and action was indeed plentiful. There were a great deal of laughs too (mostly intentional) anyone who hasn't seen this but just wants relax and enjoy a good (yet Shallow) action flick then this certainly fits the bill.For pure entertainment value i score it 8/10If this is for you then check out The Core and Independence Day, avoid the Day after Tomorrow and Deep Impact, there not really for action fans.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The Good & Bad Of 'Armageddon',"This could have been super but, as with the case of most modern action films, the action is way overdone. Still, it had its moments.....THE BAD -One word describes a lot of scenes in here: chaos. Things are blown up all over the place, people are shouting everywhere. It gets to be too much, especially in the last hour which gets ludicrous. You practically have a headache when you're finished watching the 150 minutes of mayhem.Half of the disasters that happen to the astronauts were not needed, and many of them come one after the other. It wound up muddling the story. Do today's filmmakers think you have to have something dramatic and loud every two minutes to keep their audiences? And talk about loud.....holy eardrums, Bataman, you could be deaf listening to this movie which includes a lot of loud heavy-metal ""music."" It's too noisy.There are touches of ""Independence Day"" mentality with very unrealistic with a veteran astronaut smuggling a gun on board a ship; the daughter of the one of the astronauts barging into the command center and shoving the center's leader in the middle of a crisis (in reality, she wouldn't be allowed in the room to begin with); and the usual last-second impossible heroics. I mean, sometimes I swear I was watching a movie made specifically for morons. Speaking of stupid, what was that goofy cosmonaut character (Peter Stormare) all about. That's just another example of what I was just talking about - totally unrealistic people. Why does Hollywood like to portray astronauts - some of the classiest, most educated and reserved people in the world - in such a negative light? Just another of its sicknesses, I guess where good is bad and bad is good.THE GOOD - What was great to watch in this film were the special-effects, especially the disaster scenes with the meteors hitting the earth. They were spectacular. A few of the panoramic scenes in here were beautiful, too. (This is a must for widescreen DVD.)There is a good mix of humor in this adventure thriller. That humor makes some of the characters likable, even though they are still unrealistically sleazy heroes. Steve Buscemi had most of the good comedic lines. I liked Billy Bob Thornton as the NASA boss. He's very interesting to watch. Bruce Willis plays his normal macho-hero role. His heroic effort in the end is nicely sentimental. The special-effects, as mentioned earlier, were perhaps the best right in the first 5-10 minutes of the film - a real attention-grabber right off the bat. Actually, the first half of this film is far better than the second half.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Also this was not your 'typical' Bruce Willis action role.  He did a great job in this.  I felt as though it was one of his best performances and fortunately it was in a great movie.Only one person I know enjoyed Deep Impact over this once since it had two comets instead of one.

"Not a masterpiece, but good fun besides","There are things wrong with Armageddon, but I don't think it is a bad movie. In fact I think it more as a guilty pleasure. It is shallow in the character development, the film is much too long by twenty minutes not helped by the sappy love-story subplot and Ben Affleck got on my nerves. With its faults it is entertaining, and I do think it is better than Pearl Harbor, which had amazing spectacle but was bloated and had an awful script. So what makes Armageddon entertaining? Well, the visuals are incredible, and the music is great. I liked the script, clichéd it may be but there was enough tongue-in-cheek for me to be entertained by, and the film realises it's a parody and that it is politically incorrect something those talentless hacks Friedberg and Seltzer should have already learnt by now. The direction is decent, and the acting was good, Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Will Patton and Steve Buschemi coming off best. Overall, no masterpiece by all means, but it is not Michael Bay's worst movie and definitely not the worst movie ever. 7/10 for the entertainment value and the visuals alone.

At least it's honest,"You know, looking at what people here have to say about this movie, I think there are two problems. One, some people have no tolerance for pure entertainment. Not every movie has to explore the depths of humanity, and teach us new things about ourselves. Some of the greatest movies aver hardly do that. On the other hand, there are variances in entertainment. Those who proclaim Armageddon to be the greatest action movie ever are generally those who, last summer, said the same about Con Air, and the year before, said the same about Independence Day.Now, Armageddon is slightly better than the absolute mediocrity and ""one-time-in-the-theater-but-only-with-a-big-screen-and- digital-sound"" kind of summer hit that we usually see, but by two virtues only.The first is its blunt honesty. It promises no plot, no characters, little reason to care, etc. It does promise all the visceral pleasures you can get your fill of, if you're up to it. And on that level, it aims, and hits the target with style. I wouldn't see it more than a couple times, I wouldn't buy it except to test my DVD surround setup, but I do find much of it to be decent escapist fun. And then some of it is also extremely boring.On full-screen VHS with TV sound and the lights on, and the expectation of anymore than a purely technical film experience, it's not worth the time.And one more thing: I, for one, appreciate the extreme care that went into Armageddon. The technical skill required to make it happen were far more impressive than most movies of this type. If the pace made it hard to follow, try paying more attention, because had it not been made as it was, it would have been even more boring. I wish, though, that it lived up to the superiority of The Rock.Oh, and by honest, I'm largely comparing to the shallowness of Deep Impact. This one delivered everything it said it was going to, and didn't try to trick us into thinking it was any more.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Enjoyable back then and enjoyable now...,"Having sat down in 2022 to watch the 1998 action sci-fi movie ""Armageddon"" for the fifth time or so since it was released, I have to say that director Michael Bay's movie continues to be as enjoyable and entertaining today as it was 24 years ago.The storyline in ""Armageddon"", as written by J. J. Abrams, Jonathan Hensleigh and Robert Roy Pool, is rather enjoyable. Sure, it is pretty straight forward stuff, generic and predictable to the core, as it usually is with these end-of-the-world-by-celestrial-bodies-hurling-towards-Earth kind of disaster movies. So you know what you are in for and what you are getting, and the movie's ending is every bit as predictable as you would expect. But it works. Oh yeah, it works.Aside from having a good and enjoyable, albeit a somewhat cheesy and generic, storyline then ""Armageddon"" has a really, really impressive cast ensemble. There are so many great talents and names on the cast list here that it is bordering on being overwhelming. With the likes of Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Ben Affleck, Will Patton, Steve Buscemi, William Fichtner, Owen Wilson, Michael Clarke Duncan, Peter Stormare, Jason Isaacs and Keith David, among many others, then you truly are in for a spectacular cast ensemble. I am not a fan of Ben Affleck in any ways, but I will say that ""Armageddon"" is by far one of his more memorable and better movie performances. It was Peter Stomare that stole the show here for me, with his performance as the aloof Russian astronaut Lev Andropov.Visually ""Armageddon"" is quite good, even 24 years after it was released. And an action sci-fi such as ""Armageddon"" would have failed catastrophically if it didn't have proper special effects. And believe you me, the special effects hold up even today. So thumbs up to the CGI and special effects teams for this achievement.""Armageddon"" is a timeless movie, a classic in its genre, no doubt about it. Campy and cheesy, for sure, but this is entertainment done right.My rating of ""Armageddon"" lands on a well-deserved eight out of ten stars.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Pure Adrenaline Rush !,"Armageddon was my number one favorite film with a bullet, when I was a little boy. It was the most spectacular film I'd ever seen and it still is one of the most spectacular to ever come out. Is it a masterpiece? Yes and no. You can't compare it with mind-enriching pieces of cinematic art like Fight Club or Requiem For A Dream but it does stand out in the, relatively mindless, action genre. It does everything what an action film is required to do and more. And therefore it's an action masterpiece. It's also Michael Bay's best, though Bad Boy is my favorite Bay movie.Armageddon gives you the two-hour adrenaline rush that you wanted when walking into the theater to go see an action flick. The acting and script is definitely extraordinary for an action movie. Okay, it's not excellent but it's better than 75% of all action movies that come out, even to this day. Billy Bob Thornton and Steve Buscemi in particular did a great job and this movie wouldn't have been the same without them.I'm not going to reveal anything about the plot since I don't want to include any spoilers in my comment.

Not Quite The End of The World...,"I'll be the first to tell you, special FX are not what I look for when I am hitting the movies, I love intelligence and acting, story, story, story, good directing at least. But from the opening scenes, 'ARMAGEDDON' explodes into emergency action. This sci-fi comedy-drama was a solid hit!! I have to fully disagree with critics who will praise a horrible movie and then say that a story like this is not bigger than life. This is a blockbuster entertainment giant, with a striking sense of humor, which 'Rockhound' (Bucsemi) provided many laughs, along with the rest of the multi-talented and troubled 'troup' of civilized maniacs. I truly think that the plot of the story is fun to think about, the world needs to be saved by a bunch of motley-ruff necks that can hardly obey the regular laws in their own city and now, they are going to work with the laws of gravity, science and all else to keep the planet from becoming a memory. Every movie mogul wants a block buster that is going to in essence save the world from total oblation and hit the box office with a vengeance. This one does it with he-man style and a wise-crack or two. They all ride together though, Harry Stamper, Grace the young in love daughter of Harry, Charles Chapple er, I mean 'Chick', A.J. also in love with Grace much to Harry's uneasiness, 'Rockhound' who just wants to have girls' who 'just want to have fun' the man who is a sky-scraper if anything else, Jayotis 'Bear' who is strong and a bit on the sensitive side, just to give us equilibrium, when they landed on the surface of the huge rock and he looks up and emotional and exclaims Thank you Jesus! The theater roared! He was right though. Then there is 'Oscar' who is a fun having not so fearless worker, and the comically sarcastic, but easy going Max, all under N.A.S.A Administrator Dan Truman who can't fly anymore. But he gets to watch these birds-of-a-feather, working together. With everyone up and going plus Lev Andropov the Russian Cosmonaut who works hard and gets a little too rowdy! They are able even with the adversity of Col. William Sharp they come together and pull it off and even with the last few moments when Harry Gives his life for A.J. in a very touching moment the story comes together and sets it right, the screw balls have a mature moment and a sobering lesson. But this crew is great!! They all mix together like a great drink. Bruce has the Juice, along with the rest of the motley crew, making this adventure a blast, even by today's standards it still comes across with strength, style, and comedic punch!Recommended for action/adventure sci-fi junkies as well as regular Joe's' like me.

This grows on you,"I remember that after seeing Armageddon for the first time, I went to look it up in IMDb, and I gave it a 6. I didn't flunk it because I had to admit that it was entertaining fun, but at the time I was miffed by the fact that it was a ridiculously, absurdly exaggerated plot, blatantly manipulative and without the faintest shade of seriousness, verisimilitude or believability. And directed like an MTV video, as you would expect from Bay. God forgive me, I even remember saying I preferred Deep Impact!A couple of years later and after seeing it two or three more times, all those things that I saw as defects I now consider as its virtues. Precisely because it dispenses completely with believability and is played continuously and exclusively for kicks, is why I love it so much now. I am amazed at the capacity this film has to grab you and take you in a roller-coaster ride, even if you know perfectly what's going to happen; I clench my fists, I bite my nails, I laugh out loud, I cry; every time I see it. My latest rating for it is a 9; I have some trouble giving it the 10 that is reserved for sublime masterpieces, but who knows, maybe I just need to see it one more time...",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Entertainment to the max!,"I wasn't that pleased with the other disaster flick, Deep Impact, which was released earlier than Armageddon, so I wasn't really expecting it to be all that good. Although it wasn't great, Armageddon entertained me to the max, which made it for me not to enjoy.At the obligatory scientific-military crisis conflab with NASA's director (Billy Bob Thornton) we get a refresher course in extermination events. This particular cosmic uh-oh, Asteroid Dottie, is the size of Texas and will hit planet Earth in 18 days, leaving not even a bacterium alive. Our only hope is for a rock rendezvous mission to drill a hole deep into the sucker and nuke it at the core. Hence the urgent need to locate ""the world's best deep-core driller"". Cue Bruce Willis as Harry Stamper, a rowdy, globe-trotting maverick inspired by famed oil well firefighter Red Adair. Harry graciously agrees to save the world - like ya do - but only if he can take his own team with him. Enter a ragtag bag of roughneck, rambunctious and ex-criminal cowboys who include Harry's calm best buddy (Will Patton), a gigantic muscleman Ving Rhames lookalike (Michael Clarke Duncan), a Zen-babbling young dude Matthew McConaughey lookalike (Owen Wilson), the handsome reckless stud (Ben Affleck) - who's in love with Harry's gorgeous, headstrong daughter (Liv Tyler) - and a wisecracking weirdo genius geologist (it could only be Steve Buscemi).Armageddon gets more exciting, more intense every second, every minute. The actors are all fine, Bruce Willis is great as Harry, Ben Affleck is an excellent supporter and Liv Tyler is beautiful. She is the stand-out of Armageddon, her performance being Oscar-worthy and all The direction was also impressive, especially for a guy I have quite frankly never heard of! The only thing that needs a little work is the screenplay, which seems rushed at times, and silly at others.Armageddon is an entertaining, under-appreciated little gem which deserves praise.I rate Armageddon 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

One good thing....,"There is a glimmer of hope in the event of a real-life Armageddon of an asteroid striking the earth.  Certainly, all life will end on this planet, but it will also TAKE THIS MOVIE WITH IT!!! This ranks (pun intended) as one of the worst movies I have ever seen (1950's monster movies not withstanding).  The acting is sooooo bad in this movie (Who the hell told Liv Tyler she could act???), and Bruce Willis should be completely embarrassed by this flick.  Movies such as these are the reason I save my $7 at the theater, and wait til it comes on HBO.  Of course, a lot of people will say that you can't get the full effect of the movie without seeing it on the big screen.  While that may be true, it's pretty sad that you have to judge a movie simply by special effects and only when they're seen on the big screen.One final note:  When I watch a movie about the ""end of the earth"", I really would like to actually SEE the end of the earth, and not some hokey story about 1 person saving the day at the last minute.  Does EVERY movie HAVE to have a happy ending? In the case of Armageddon, the happy ending was the ending itself!",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
a love it or hate it type of movie,"This is definitely the type of movie you'll either love or hate.I personally love it, I am a Die Hard (lol) Bruce Willis fan.  All characters were supurbly cast.  Busemi as Rock, Affleck as AJ, Tyler as Grace, Thornton as Truman, ect....  All of them seemed to work well together. Their character just fit them. Lots of people didn't like this movie for they believed that it is too far fetched, which isn't true.  One of NASA's theories IS to land on, and drill into a ""global killer"".  And as it is also said in the movie we don't have the budget to look for these things. Amatures are the people that usually find them.  Another thing people over look is the fact that Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer worked with NASA on the factual aspects of the movie. They didn't just make these things up.(all of this is said in the commentaries on the criterion collection) The other thing about this movie is, you have to like science, space and the things that go with it (like me ""aero_nut""). And you have to appreciate the fact, and not be obtuse that this could happen one day, God destroyed the Earth before he could do it again. I really believe that the love story helped this movie make money, (thats what made Titanic #1), Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck made a great couple. The chemistry between them was awesome.  Not to mention this is americans at their best,(with the help of a russian friend, who is perfectly cast as stormare). The love song to this movie is definitely a topper, Dianne Warren has graced so many movies with her songs and this has to be the best so far. Furthermore very few rock bands can sound good with a orchestra, (G-N-R is one) and Aerosmith certainly fit the bill here.  i love this cast  the movie and the soundtrack, but thats just me.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Big Budget Action, Adventure Blockbuster","24 May 2016. Weathering the release of Deep Impact two months earlier, Armageddon relies on its bigger budget, bigger explosions, and bigger intense build-up of non-stop crises, and larger than life predictable entertainment to overcome a slow start to outperform Deep Impact. This big action adventure relies on a scripted pattern of hanging by your seat mini-episodes loaded with exaggerated humor, superhero outcomes, and light-hearted banter, especially from wacked out Steve Buscemi. This action fantasy is almost pure entertainment with the requisite love interest, the human sacrifices, and the frantic mission controller. This movie pushes all the audience buttons, moves at a whithering fast pace, and glorifies the Russian stereotypes to an almost embarrassing degree.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

An awesome movie,"First and foremost, it was great to see Bruce Willis doing something that didn't involve him rolling on the floor, machine guns blazing.I have to agree and disagree with some of the comments posted about this movie.

Rent the movie again, and this time, pay attention. Really folks, what would you do if you had 36 hours to live.  Where would you be?  Most of us don't know the answer to this, and those of us who do, would like to forget.All that aside, I think the special effects in this movie were spectular, and even the side-line characters were interesting.

Save humanity...,"""Armageddon"" is an Action - SciFi movie in which we watch a group of deep-core drillers trying to save the Earth from a huge asteroid. They will work together with NASA in order to succeed on saving Earth and humanity from this asteroid but they both have to hurry.I liked this movie very much because it was very interesting despite its simple plot. The direction which was made by Michael Bay, it was very good and he succeeded on creating a bond between the audience and his main characters, something that made the movie more realistic. The interpretations of both Bruce Willis who played as Harry S. Stamper and Ben Affleck who played as A. J. Frost were very good. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Billy Bob Thornton who played as Dan Truman, Steve Buscemi who played as Rockhound and Liv Tyler who played as Grace Stamper. Lastly, I have to say that ""Armageddon"" is a very interesting movie, full of suspense and action that will keep you in tense through its whole duration.

What's wrong with people?,"When I look at the comments for this movie, I see a few things in common among all the ""critics"" here.

Also, the main characters aren't supposed to be ""astronauts"", this isn't Apollo XIII or whatever, oil drillers going on an asteroid to blow it up, come on, its different. We don't want another boring space movie. The main parts I'll agree with people in bringing this movie's rating down were the drama, and Ben Affleck. The drama in this movie was very misplaced. It was very long, drawn out, and plain boring. I felt no emotion watching it whatsoever, and I wasn't supposed to as this wasn't supposed to be a drama movie in the first place. Then there's Ben Affleck, the king of the drama. WHy was he in this movie? In fact, why is he in any movie? He ruins every movie he's in.

For me, it was the incessant action, the consistent blasts and explosions that wore me down over time.As far as the characters are concerned, Bruce Willis' as Harry garnered the greatest acclaim, and he certainly earned it.

Darn good popcorn movie,"I don't care if it's a popcorn movie by intention. It's still a darn good movie. One that I can watch many times.""The characters are predictable"". Someone took this as a negative, but the reviewer was quite far from proving his point. Well, in case of Rock Hound, you can't really say that, can you? And neither can you in case of Harry Stomper. Would you say that Colonel Willie Sharp was predictable? Or Dan Truman? Not so, sorry.True, the story is a little far fetched. Then again no one remembers ""Deep Impact"", which was more or less about the same event, except written and performed so insignificantly, it felt into oblivion.The jokes. The funny situations. The funny dialogs. ""Gee, lady, I just came here to drill"". ""So did I!"" This movie has the cinematographic equivalent of salt and pepper, and just about right mix of the laughing gas and tear gas.For a long time I didn't know that, but I have been turning into a Michael Bay's fan.

Armageddon A Good But Overlong Action Aventure,"Armageddon is a good but overlong action adventure from director Michael Bay who does show his talent with this movie but the running time of 150 minutes does weight it down a bit. Bay none the less proves to be a skilled filmmaker no matter how good or bad his movies turned out. The talented cast are admirable in their roles including Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thorton, Liv Tyler, Ben Affleck, Will Patton, and Steve Buscemi. Jason Isaacs, Keith David, Peter Storemare, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Owen Wilson in a brief appearance are effective as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. The special effects are state of the art even though you can tell it's CGI. The action sequences are intense but it's the scenes in between and the slow pace at times is what hurt the film the most at least to me. The music seemed to sync very well with what was happening on the screen including the song by Aerosmith and it fit the tone of the film.There was some suspense build up as the giant asteroid in space gets closer and closer to Earth while the heroes desperately try to destroy it in time to save their planet. The ending was touching but I found it to be a little predictable but fortunately the good outweighs the bad in this one. Armageddon isn't a great movie but it's not too bad either if it had been shorter I probably would've enjoyed the film more than I did. Overall despite it's flaws, Armageddon is an overlong but for the most part an entertaining adventure with just enough action, some suspense, thrills, impressive special effects, humor, a little romance, and good performances by the cast who make it worth watching at least once.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A must see.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
As Subtle as a Sledgehammer,"You could apply this same sentiment to director Michael Bay himself, the mastermind behind this seminal blockbuster, but then you'd also have to admit this film makes him something of a pioneer. Let's rewind a bit first.An asteroid « the size of Texas » is on a collision course with Earth, so NASA scrambles its finest to bring a team of drillers to the deadly rock, where they will plant nukes in it and obliterate before it exterminates humanity. You could fly actual space shuttles through the plot-holes in this film - the unlikely sum of six screenwriters' toil - but one of the many things Armageddon pioneered is a relentless style and pace that leaves little time to pause for breath, let alone ponder such things. So the man of the hour is grizzled drilling vet Harry Stamper (Willis, at the peak of his popularity), whose idiosyncratic crew includes son-in-law-to-be A. J. (Affleck in his first mega budget outing) and daughter Grace (Tyler, who can gaze wantonly at a monitor like few actresses before or since).Here we need to pause in wonder at who approved such an awe-inspiring cast. Willis doesn't evoke financial risk, and it is nice to see him invest a character with feeling - one of the very last times he would do so - but the credits are something of a miracle. Billy Bob Thornton as a NASA head honcho, Steve Buscemi as a sex-crazed drilling prodigy (yes, yes, I know...), Jason Isaacs, William Fichtner, Owen Wilson, Keith David... Remember this is a blockbuster from the late 90s. It's just awe-inspiring to watch such talented performers rip into such ludicrous material and twist it around their little fingers like pros, and the film would never have connected half as well with audiences without them. But here the subtle pleasures of life end and we need to examine the very raw meat of this film.Before it was even fashionable to do so, Michael Bay films every scene not just like trailer material, but like a set piece. No moment is too small to get the BIG treatment. He also ramps up the color saturation to something approaching pop art: skins are golden, almost orange, and deep space a frosty teal. You can see where this is going? The only director to have taken this approach any further - almost as a joke it would seem - has been George Miller with Mad Max Fury Road (an infinitely superior film to be sure but similar in its intent to be a purely visceral crowd-pleaser). The music is big and anonymous in equal measure and the pop song needle drops as refined as the rest of the product. Aerosmith's centerpiece « Don't Want to Miss a Thing » made many a desperate listener claw at their eardrums for relief in late 1998, and there is something deliciously sick in hearing Steve Tyler sing over scenes where Ben Affleck is an inch from banging his real-life daughter, particularly in a Disney production. The epilogue is legendary for its bad taste and sappiness... But if you're honest with yourself, you'll probably really enjoy yourself watching this film.Armageddon is big, its stupidity at times overpowering enough to qualify as inspiring. But it does have a personality of its own, and that is definitely something to be treasured.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Wow! What a movie!,"What a treat it is to watch this. For starters, it has a massive amount of character development, which is odd for this genre. I've actually read about people saying this movie forgot about characters and simply went for action. What are you on about. The first hour of the movie is almost pure character development. It's also got some of the best action sequences I've ever seen. Being a massive fan of sci-fi, it's great fun to watch space shuttles mauevering around, dodging debris. Its hunour element is great, actually making some application to genuine wit instead of stupid throw-away one-liners.Seriously, this movie nearly made me cry. Bruce Willis is such a good actor, you can't help but give in to the sadness of the end. It's all a result of the afore-mentioned character development. Trevor Rabins surprisingly emotional score also helps with the emotional quality of this movie. In one word, this movie is HEROIC. Everything about it is about being a hero. So see it, if you haven't already. It's not the most realistic movie of all time, It's no 'Saving Private Ryan', but it is a great movie(What else would you expect from Michael Bay and Jerry Brucheimer). 9/10",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"""A Great Ride""","I could really care less for what Gene Siskel thought of this movie.  I could care less what every other critic seems to say about this movie.  This movie is great, and if you can't see that then you need to open your eyes. With a creative team of Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer you know this movie will be action packed.  But, what I thought was the real selling point of this movie was the emotions that they tried to hit with the audience. When you watch the scene, in which the fallout sirens start, you can see something so human its scary and sad all at the same time, hopelessness. The cast is wonderful, blending old and new.  Bruce Willis plays Harry, the world's best oil driller.  Ben Affleck plays A.J., Harry's aspiring apprentice.  Billy Bob Thorton plays Truman, a NASA operator that relies on Harry to save us all.  Then, there always has to be the leading lady, Liv Tyler, who plays Harry's daughter and A.J.'s girlfriend.  I can agree that the depth in this movie is not what makes Oscar pay attention.  But, to counter that, I don't want to know the story of Harry's life like Roger Eibert may want to.  In a slower film I would, and maybe it wouldn't have been bad, but I DIDN'T NEED IT.  As with every Jerry Bruckheimer film the cinimatography was excellent.  He is the master at moving the camera and slowing the scene down at exactly the right time.  In other words, the camera moves beautifully.  Now, despite what you have heard, this movie has moments of blunt honesty and deep emotions.  The scene in which Grace asks A.J. if he thought that anyone in the world was enjoying a moment such as theirs, and he responds, quote, ""I hope so, otherwise what the hell are we trying to save."" was one of the truest statements made in a recent movie. Then, there is A.J. screaming I love you as he is lifted from Harry back into the shuttle.  The rawness of the emotions are what make them work. This film would have been cheesy if it was these two sitting there on their way back to earth claiming their love and respect for each other.  A true unsung hero of this movie is the character played by Will Patton.  He was seemingly dark but really was sweet.  One other member of the cast that requires mentioning is William Fichtner as Col. Sharp.  He plays the scared, ""I only do what I am told"" fly boy so well.  And, then, the character change he undergoes is all summed up by him realizing that not always are your superiors right.  It's the little moments in this movie that really make it work.  Each of these tiny moments form up to show the own big picture.  And isn't that what life's about?  Our lives are tiny memories put together to form one incredible life.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A relic from a bygone era in disaster cinema,"Before Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckhiemer redefined the summer blockbuster with their gargantuan 'Transformers' and 'Pirates of the Caribbean' franchises, they struck box office gold with 1998's 'Armageddon.' The doomsday disaster pic redefined the global apocalyptic genre and paved the way for many similar films to follow (ignoring the fact that the inferior 'Deep Impact' preceded it by a few months).While 'Armageddon' is filled with many Bay-isms that ratchet up the cheese factor, it's still an American classic. From relying on a rag-tag oil rig crew to save the world to starring one of the biggest action heroes of the 90s and featuring a soundtrack with one of the schlockiest, most overplayed songs of the past few decades, the disaster film is about as hyped up as they come. Despite plenty of plot holes, close calls and off-the-wall scenes, 'Armageddon' is still a fun mission - thanks in large part to an all-star cast (Thornton, Tyler, Affleck, Duncan, Buscemi, Wilson to name a few).Sure, it doesn't hold up well compared to the more sophisticated, slick, modern efforts in this genre nowadays, but it holds a special place in the hearts of many fans of heroic quests to save humanity from the countless unlikely galactic threats out there.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Armageddon,"This starts off quite entertaingly as ""Stamper"" (Bruce Willis) discovers that his daughter ""Grace"" (Liv Tyler) has been having a romance with one of his employees ""AJ"" (Ben Affleck) and so chases him around a drilling establishment taking pot shots at him with a shotgun. Sadly, though, this silliness is soon replaced by a greater one as we discover a great meteor is heading our way and ""Stamper"" and his team might be the only hope for mankind. Egged on by ""Truman"" (Billy Bob Thornton) they must quickly learn to be astronauts, then by way of a Russian space station, head into space to plant a gazillion ton nuclear bomb on the thing so it will split up and harmlessly pass us by. This is probably Willis at the top of his game, lively and mischievous and Affleck was at his most eye-catching, but the rest of this just just fits nicely into the well trodden sphere of sci-fi disaster movie. The visual effects are fine, but the dialogue is pretty pedestrian and the ending has a cheesy sentimentality to it that made my eyes roll. It is far, far too long. We spend at least an hour faffing about on the preamble, establishing the characters and when finally lift off comes, I was not entirely convinced the meteor wasn't welcome. There is quite a fun contribution from cosmonaut ""Andropov"" (Peter Stormare) who knows just how to fix high-spec technology, but otherwise this is all just a rather colourful vehicle for the star that is enjoyable enough, eventually, but really nothing to phone home about.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Excellent Movie,"I have to chuckle when people break this movie down by how 'realistic' it may not be. Was the Poseidon Adventure based on anything that ever did or could occur? No. Was the Towering Inferno true to real life? No. Was Earthquake just exactly like a real earthquake? No. All the disaster films of the 70's were big budget and very entertaining...and so was Armageddon which I compare it to those great films. This is a fantastic, big budget, over the top action film with the same feeling as those 70's films. The cast was excellent and I'm disappointed when a see an actor 'disowning' a film that they star in that was so good.

Kinda exhausting,"""Armageddon"" is not a film, but just a bunch of scenes that almost didn't become disconnected from each other. Nothing that the ""film"" shows is believable or reasonable, and it is difficult to hear of a film production that has abused clichés as much as this one. Not even the good cast could save this work by Michael Bay - after all, there's no point in having good actors and putting them in absurdly boring and unfunny scenes. One of the first memories I have of seeing a film in theaters, and I don't remember details, but I remember the sensations and thoughts in a vague way, which were the same ones I had when I watched Michael Bay films in the cinema, when adult: ""this is boring, I'm tired and I want to leave."" The only good aspects of the film are that Aerosmith song that a lot of people love but are afraid to admit, and that Robot Chicken parody that is one of the only really funny scenes in the show, but that's not even part of the film itself.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The spectacle of the film is sometimes impressive, but not enough to save it from its relentless predictability.Liv Tyler, who plays the daughter of Harry Stamper, offers some relief as a love interest for one of the crew (Ben Affleck).

Simply the best film of 1998 with all the elements of Blockbuster!,"Those who say Armageddon is '99% special effects, 1% story' did not even pay attention to the movie, nor go into it wanting to like it.  The plot that was presented was all that was needed for a disaster movie, plus a few side stories.  An asteroid the size of Texas is headed for earth, and NASA has to employ a few of the worlds best drillers to go up into space, drill, and plant a bomb. What more do you want for an action movie about a disaster?? Armageddon is an emotional thrillride, filled with action, adventure, explosions, Bruce Willis, and most of all heart.  It has a lot of comedic interludes (some a bit silly) but it is very much welcomed in what could have been a depressing movie, like DEEP IMPACT(horrible, horrible movie). We all know what will happen.  But unlike most movies where we know the score ahead of time, Armageddon makes it fun.  Some of Hollywood's most respected actors are put through NASA training, set to cool music by Aerosmith and Trevor Rabin, and sent up to space in order to intercept an oncoming asteroid.  Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler, Billy Bob Thornton, Will Patton, and Steve Buscemi take us for the ride of our lives..... Well, at least the ride of the summer.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Cheerful, cornball heroics are its saving grace","If the gatekeepers of pop culture cool here on the inter-webs are to be believed, Michael Bay's 'Armageddon' is the most despised mega-hit of all-time. However, I'm less and less convinced that all of the vitriol aimed against it is sincere.

And if its nothing more than a bunch of ""jingoistic"" flag waving, why did it make so much money outside of the United States? It doesn't add up.'Armageddon' is corny, it ignores logic and thumbs its nose at the basic laws of physics, but it does so solely to tell a rousing story of cheerful heroics and old fashioned derring-do.

It's not that it's bad - I just don't like being taken for stupid!,"There are far too many high quality reviews on this film for me to make any real impact with my humble views. However... I re-watched Armageddon on TV a few nights ago and now, ten years after it was unleashed, I feel I can take a more pragmatic view.Most of the articulate and intelligent reviews that have already been written cover off the preposterous nature of the science which underpins the woeful script. For example, the varying degrees to which gravity obeys the laws of dramatic tension rather than the laws of physics, the absolute necessity to have some serious Gatlin guns mounted on the drilling vehicles (what were they expecting  annoyed aliens?), the ludicrous notion that NASA would let the moronic men-children anywhere within fifty miles of a shuttle - rather than simply train their own highly disciplined astronauts to operate a drill, the cardboard cut-out Russian cosmonaut whose script direction read ""SHOUTING"" at the beginning of each line. And... nukes with big green countdown read-outs on them, 12-inch diameter drills that make 36-inch diameter holes, Earth shorn of time-zones and the amazing a ability to put on sun-glasses whilst wearing a space-suit helmet. You get the gist, the list is endless.All these and many other inconsistencies, inaccuracies and failures of reason are just about forgivable if the movie delivers what it is meant to, which on some levels it does, I suppose. The thing that really gets me though, and this is the bit that I find pretty unforgivable, is that the makers of the movie assume that I (and you) are morons who will let these issues go without questioning. Maybe for some of the Cletuses and Darlenes out there  well, OK. But the vast majority of us average intelligence movie goers will say, ""Whoa, hold on buddy. Do you expect me to swallow that premise or this notion?"" To which Bay and his ilk say, ""Sure, why not, eat your popcorn."" That's what really irks me. The fact that they had all this money to spend and they used four dollars of it on technical advice for the script. Sheesh.""Space dementia""... really, I ask you.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Armageddon is far better than Deep Impact.,"Though not a great movie since it does go on too long, there's more action, special effects, emotion and characters with personality. They seem to care about what's happening and try and do something about rather than anticipating its arrival. One of the reasons why is because it already opens with a bang (literally) when giant bits of rock in flames attack the city and more danger is scheduled soon. This is sort of like The Abyss except above Earth rather than underwater. Both movies have a crew that are trying to find out how to stop an already hostile situation by using their resources to uncover an unidentified natural disaster before it gets worse.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Not only does this movie have the A list Willis but also an amazing supporting cast with afleck, Duncan, buscemi, Wilson, Patton, and most impressively Billy Bob Thornton who is amazing in this role.

Good entertainment in spite of flaws,"""Armageddon"" is one of those films that you are not supposed to like. Probably because it's more about special effects than an interesting script. So, having said that, I must admit that even though I didn't want to like it I actually did. Sure, I'm not saying that I like it in the same way I like, for instance, Bergman's ""Smiles of a Summer Night"" or Tamahori's ""Once Were Warriors"", but I still like it. It's not a masterpiece, but I think it is great entertainment and sometimes that's exactly what I need, two hours of watching a film that doesn't force me use my brain too much.And Billy Bob Thornton's in it! I actually didn't know that before I saw this film (shame on me, because Billy Bob is one of my favourite actors). And Steve Buscemi was hilarious. Peter Stormare was kind of irritating, he needs to get other parts than the ones he's been doing lately (like a German nihilist in ""The Big Lebowski"" and Velvet in ""8MM""), he was still pretty funny though. Bruce Willis was not very good, I think we're all tired of watching him save the world or a city or whatever. Liv Taylor is not the best actress around, but then her part didn't demand much, so I guess she did alright. Ben Affleck was nothing special. I hardly remember he was in the film at all.Well, good entertainment, at times a lousy script, though, and good performances from at least two people of the cast I'm not ashamed to give this film 5/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Alas, the end of the world was not nigh","While watching this film, I was reminded of the futility of trusting politicians. This moment came when the President of the United States said ""the bible calls this time Armageddon - the end of all things""It's a sad fact, but life is never that kind.When big, bad, balding, butch Bruce looks solemnly into the camera and, with creditable sincerity, delivers the line ""six billion people on the planet, why d'ya call me?"" you know something special is afoot. Lesser men - Lawrence Olivier, maybe, or Alec Guinness - would have cringed at the thought of having to deliver such verbiage without an ironic sneer. Not Bruce. Bruce, like the women of Sunset Strip, is a pro. Either that, or ironic sneers were not required in his contract. Judging by the rest of the film, neither were shame, dignity or self-respect.Were there ever to be an unholy union between Top Gun and Cobra, the cinematic wreckage that would result might resemble Armageddon. It's a testosterone fuelled, guttural paean to trailer park America.In many Hollywood films, for instance, technical jargon is used to pad out a dull script. Armageddon is no exception, except that here the writers clearly couldn't be bothered to find any real jargon and just made stuff up. Zero Barrier for example - what the hell is that? Freedom is ""off the Grid"" I mean pleeease! Jargon this implausible hasn't been heard since the British Government implored junkies not to shared their ""works"". Even taking into account the fact that I was hardly expecting Woody Allen, it's just awful.Special effects wail around the vacuum where the story is supposed to be, looking for something to do, looking for something to affect, looking to go bang. It's not surprising then that, many, many things bang in this film - and I'm not talking about Ben Afleck. Immediately following a distasteful little scene where our Bruce is driving golf balls at people in a Greenpeace boat, and playing it for the hilarious laughs such behaviour obviously deserves, his Oil Rig explodes. Then his test rig at NASA explodes, then the Russian Space Station, then a Space Shuttle, Then a Thermonuclear Device, followed shortly (and mercifully) by himself.Things go bang, then. Good basis for a multi-million dollar film project.But by far and away the most depressing thing about this film is the cast list. Leaving aside the bald one, whose occasional forays into the world of acting we already knew to be liberally interspersed with pap of the highest order, there's Steve Buscemi (not only a good actor, but a very decent director), Billy Bob Thornton, Ben Afleck, Michael Clarke Duncan, Jason Isaacs, Peter Stormare (who somehow manages to steal it, though give it back, I say) - I mean even Owen Wilson. Do none of these people know better? Obviously not.Some will no doubt say that I am being a curmudgeon, and that not all films need to explore the ""depths of humanity"". I agree.Unfortunately, this film does explore the depths of humanity, it just doesn't realise it's doing it. 2/10",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

At the beginning, I notice that all of them wear jeans which have been the mark of American, like the hat of cowboy. The job may be dangerous because of storm ,but they love challenge.Self-reliance is another part I see from American. They tear down the drill cars that take NASA millions of dollar and then rebuild them the way they like. That is one of the reasons they overcome the bad situation in the end. Self-reliance may be the reason why there is no other country join the saving plan except a drunk Russian. Just like a hundred years ago, rugged individualists, like Daniel Boone, Jesse James and Wyatt Earp ,and many other people tried to conquer ""the Wild West"" by themselves.From the start to finish, president to soldiers, no one ever thought about what will happen if they don't win. All I see is ""I can do it! "" ""We can get it!"" ""God bless America"". ""Can-Do"" is the power that change impossible to possible.The most impression of America that I get from the film is equality. In front of risk, we are equal to each other.

The worst thing about the movie is that it managed to make every character extremely annoying and obnoxious, maybe with the exception of Willis and Tyler.  If everyone except Willis died on the mission, I would've been happy; unfortunately, it worked in the opposite way.And one more thing: I couldn't keep a straight face throughout the movie (a mixture of disbelieving laughter and frowns) since they started talking about drilling a hole into the asteroid.  Right.  Then just watching them actually do the drilling, in space, on an asteroid traveling really fast towards the earth is a priceless bit of comedy; unfortunately, the movie was not meant to be a comedy.

Bruce Willis is back on the top!Both thumbs UP!!!   10++/10",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not nearly as bad as the critics would have you believe,"These days it's become fashionable to regard any Michael Bay picture with extreme derision, particularly amongst the critical community. However, upon recently rewatching Bay's 1998 blockbuster ""Armageddon"" I am forced to admit that he has indeed directed a few watchable movies.The story here is fairly preposterous but what do you expect from a big-budget disaster movie? In this case, a meteor that could wipe out all of mankind is hurtling toward earth and no-one seems to know what to do about it. However, before long, NASA scientists decide that humanity's best bet is to send a rag-tag team of misfits into space to blow the meteor apart before it's too late.The movie has a fairly hefty 151 minute runtime but I don't really think that it's entirely justified. There are some parts that feel like contrived diversions meant only to superficially create drama or to contribute to characterization. The movie is also guilty of being somewhat maudlin at times and also a bit too overtly patriotic. Nevertheless, over the long haul, the script holds together well enough to retain your interest without straining credulity beyond the breaking point.One big asset for the movie is the loaded cast. Sure, stars Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck & Liv Tyler have all been better elsewhere but the real meat of the cast is in the supporting players. There are some of the best Hollywood character actors here like Billy Bob Thornton, Steve Buscemi, Michael Clarke Duncan, Will Patton, William Fichtner, Peter Stormare & Keith David. The filmmakers even managed to get Charlton Heston for the opening narration. It'd be difficult not to appreciate a cast like that, no matter what kind of material they've got to work with.On the visual side, Michael Bay's direction is well handled but his penchant for quick cuts is in evidence throughout the film. Sometimes this works well but other times it seems superfluous (though it isn't necessarily distracting). The Oscar-nominated special effects have also held up surprisingly well.Musically, the movie's a bit of a mixed bag. On one hand, there's some classic ZZ Top, Aerosmith & Curtis Mayfield but on the other hand there's some Journey, Jon Bon Jovi and, of course, Aerosmith's schmaltzy Dianne Warren-penned smash ""I Don't Want to Miss a Thing"". Trevor Rabin's score is pretty solid throughout, though.Ultimately, ""Armageddon"" is a worthwhile big budget spectacle. The storytelling may be a bit clumsy but the movie actually has a fair amount going for it. As far as popcorn entertainment goes, you could certainly do a lot worse than this.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Die Hard .... In Space,"Now I love this film for the sum of its parts... Steve Buscemi as Rockhound - a great actor and some of his one liners are excellent. Peter Stormare as the Cosmonaut is damn funny, and many of the actors all add something. Bruce Willis hits a chord with me as a Father, as I was in poor health and possibly leaving my only daughter. Willis had me laughing at the beginning when he tried to shoot Ben Affleck and then I was in tears as he said goodbye to his daughter. Is it 2001 A Space Odyssey, no it is not (but then I think that is highly over-rated) and am I a pretentious critic? No - I will watch a film on its merits and judge it for that. If they had tried to portray this film as a deep and meaningful comment on the human races attitude to our planet, then yes it failed miserably. Personally, I thought it was an ENJOYABLE film bit OTT in places, bit predictable in others but worth watching overall.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Terrible,"I can't say I've seen too many movies more depressing than this, and it's supposed to be a big exhilarating action movie, but it's really not.

Thought-provoking action disaster drama.,"Love him or hate him (I love him!), Michael Bay can be considered the Master of Disaster - and I mean this as a complement! His destruction scenes are incredibly well done (think the Transformers movies, Pearl Harbor, The Rock, 13 Hours, 6 Underground, etc.) The New York meteor shower scenes were fantastic!!The film features great performances from a veteran cast, and the visuals are amazing. As with most of Michael Bay's movies, there's a lot of humor to break the seriousness of any situation. I generally don't approve of this method, but at least in 'Armageddon' it never becomes slapstick or overbearing, although maybe way too many one-liners from Rockhound (Steve Buscemi).The humor ceases almost entirely during the last hour, as the suspense intensifies significantly. 'Armageddon' is a heroic tale of unlikely heroes. The film certainly begs the question: What if? As they remind us in the opening sequence, it happened before, so it could happen again. Yes, I believe it could. Will we be prepared, and what would our solution be? This is a great script and an incredible motion picture!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
FANTASTIC,"I just saw it!!! It's really FANTASTIC!!!! Yes maybe a little to many special effects if you don't like them (but I Do!!) but is what I call a complete movie.

Entertaining and funny,"I do not understand the furor this movie created.  It is far far from the worst scifi I've seen in the past few years.  And I know the science is all wrong - who cares?  If the science actually mattered, the only things we could watch would be documentaries on Discovery and PBS!Armageddon, like most Bruce Willis action movies is funny.  It is very very funny, especially Steve Buscemi.  Rockhound is as funny as any of his off-beat characters in Tarantino or Rodriguez movies.  Peter Stormare is excellent as the space happy Russian cosmonaut.  Bruce Willis is as always, wry and dry.  He has a splendid talent for comedy that isn't always appreciated.I'm not very knowledgeable on special effects, but the asteroid itself becomes a sinister presence in the movie.  While I realize that no asteroid ever seen looked like that vision of hell, I don't care.So, if you want to see a fun scifi, watch Armageddon.  Forget the carping. Enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
they really do not make movies like they used to.,"I have to say im not new to this movie. I love watching it whenever it pops up on TV, but OMG it is a fantastic rollercoaster.These Bruckheimer, Tony Scott and early Michael Bay movies were an absolute blast to watch. Definitely the most entertaining decade of movies after the 80's. Disaster movies like Dante's Peak, Vertical Limit, Deep Impact and even normal blockbusters like Gone in 60 Seconds, Bad Boys. Con Air and The Hunt for Red October helped to define an era in film.The fast and furious movies and newer Bay movies like transformers that keep getting churned out year after year are a terrible representation of movies. Don't turn movies into franchises unless it needs one to tell the story. These older movies are perfect standalone 2+hr movies that i'll gladly keep returning to.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Started Weak Ended Strong,"It took a while to get started, but when it did, it was pretty good. Another good Bruce Willis movie.

The beginning of the movie was dry and some of it pointless. But there are some good relationships between characters and good scenes.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Most Likely the worst film of the 90s.,"Armageddon, directed by hack Michael Bay, is an atrocious piece of wasted celluloid.  Why films like this smash box office records and other better movies suffer at the theater is beyond me.  Basically, the film is about a bunch of oil drillers who get chosen to go into space and save mankind by destroying an asteroid!!  Ben Affleck, as usual, can't act his way out of a paper bag and makes a fool out of himself in the ""animal crackers"" scene. In fact, almost nobody in this film is saved from its horrible wrath. Did anyone read the screenplay?  Does Michael Bay know how to effectively shoot a steady shot?  Is there any film with more shots of the American flag than this one? You will be asking these questions to yourself and many more while watching this pile of trash.  For a real action film see one of these:-Point Blank -Deliverance -Excalibur -Soldier of Orange -Dawn of the Dead .5/4 stars",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great fun film,"An asteroid the size of Texas is detected heading for Earth. It will wipe out all life on the planet if it hits. NASA decides that the only course of action is to plant a nuclear warhead deep into the asteroid to split it in two hoping it will safely pass Earth. They send a team of oil drillers led by Bruce Willis to drill the hole and save the Earth.This is a great disaster movie utilising the directing skills of Michael Bay, a great action movie director and when teamed with producer Jerry Bruckheimer they create some of the best action films around. The effects in this film are incredible with an out of this world storyline and a cast of greats that includes Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler, Owen Wilson, Steve Buscemi, Michael Clarke Duncan, William Fichtner & Will Patton. All great actors and all bring so much to the film, but the greatest performance is by Steve Buscemi who steals every scene he is in playing the character of Rockhound.This is an effects heavy film, but it works. The film is about chaos and destruction and the effects are relentless in the portrayal of the destruction. The spectacle of smaller asteroids crashing down to Earth is amazing to watch. Many people were put off with the effects of chaos and mayhem, but the film wouldn't have worked without it. However this film manages something most sci-fi films fail in. It manages to get you emotionally involved. I know many people that got teary eyed at the end of the film and that is something rare in a sci-fi/action film.This is a big budget blockbuster and it succeeds in every way. If you are a fan of action or sci-fi films then this is truly one not to miss out on. If you feel that with effects less is more, then this may be the wrong film for you.

"Nowadays, ""Armageddon"" functions almost as a parody. It's hyperbolic in its patriotism and hyperactive in its editing, but it still manages to work in many ways","Here is a film that caused a huge stir and, at the same time, was acclaimed by the general public and massacred by a good part of the critics. The cinematographic performance of Armageddon is, even today, something much discussed among friends and/or critics. You will find people who love the production and who hate it with all their might. It's really hard to find someone who stays in the middle ground. Despite all the controversies, everyone agrees on one point: Armageddon ended up marking the 1990s as one of the first disaster films that shook American cinemas at the same time. Since then, many have followed suit. To tell the truth, there were so many copies and similar ideas regarding this theme (the disaster movies) that it is no longer possible to distinguish who influenced and who blatantly copied whom. ""Independence Day"", ""Twister"", ""Space Cowboys"", ""Deep Impact"", ""The Day After Tomorrow"", ""2012"" are just some good examples of films that explore the same type of branch. And, inevitably, they have similar characteristics to each other, whether in the script, in the characterization of the characters or in the number of clichés adopted in the dialogues and beyond.Armageddon tells the story of a group of drillers, who live by drilling to find oil - the best group in the world -, who are called by the US government to rid the world of a threat: a large meteor that has the planet as its route. Earth, putting the lives of everyone here at stake, and it should collide with the planet in a matter of weeks. Allied to this scenario, as could not be missing from a Michael Bay film, we have a couple who live a complicated romance. Harry (Bruce Willis, from The Sixth Sense), the head of the team, is the father of the only woman in the group (Liv Tyler, from The Wonders - The Dream Didn't End), who lives a romance with the clumsiest guy in the group. Punchers (played by Ben Affleck).The film begins with a voiceover by Charlton Heston telling us about the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs. So, we can see the ""65 million years later"". The next scenes show an amateur astronomer observing an object. We come across high-level meetings at the Pentagon and the White House. We see ordinary people whose lives will be forever changed by the events to come. All of this has happened in several feature films before. There is no original idea in the film. ""Armageddon"" reportedly used the services of nine writers. Why did you need one? The dialogue is either screamed or romantic. ""It will explode!"" it's used so many times; one wonders if each writer used it once thinking it was okay.Disaster movies and tragedies of this type always have little vignettes of everyday life. The silliest one in Armageddon involves two Japanese tourists in a taxi in New York. After meteors turn an entire street into a burning wasteland, the woman complains, ""I want to go shopping."" Meanwhile, we went through a romantic subplot involving Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck (The film's original script did not include the romantic subplot between AJ (Ben Affleck) and Grace (Liv Tyler). The writing staff decided to add this story to the film. After the success Titanic (1997) had among younger audiences. )Helicopters arrive to fly Willis to the mainland so he can lead the mission to save humanity, etc., and he insists on using only his own team - especially Affleck, who is ""like a son"". What's up with the cinematographer and Liv Tyler? She's gorgeous, but she's always being photographed lying on her back or with her bra going up. (In this case, Affleck is tickling her belly button with animal crackers.) Tyler is obviously a beneficiary of ""Take Your Daughter to Work Day."" Not only is she on the oil rig, but she also attends training sessions with her dad and boyfriend, sits in Mission Control, and walks the airstrips alongside guys in aluminum suits.The characters in this movie actually say, ""I wanted to say... I'm sorry"", ""We won't leave you behind!"", ""Guys - the clock is ticking!"" and ""It turned into a surrealistic nightmare!"" Steve Buscemi, a crew member diagnosed with ""space dementia"", looks at the surface of the asteroid and adds: ""This place is like Dr. Seuss's worst nightmare."" Quick - which Seuss book is he thinking of? There are scenes in which the bombs are cleared. There's even a classic scene where they're trying to disconnect the timer and have to decide whether to cut the red wire or the blue wire. ""Armageddon"" just forgot that this wasn't a terrorist bomb. It was a standard US military bomb, which could have been defused by a military man who was on the scene specifically because he knew about the bomb... Important special effects explosions - like the asteroid - have muddy details and the movie cuts before we take a look. Good look. The few ""dramatic"" scenes are the good old clichés. And even today the big question still remains: Wasn't it easier to have trained astronauts in drilling than to give drillers a 12-day jet training on how to act in space? The script tries to explain that it should be them because ""nobody else can do the job as well as they can on the planet"", but fails to convince those who demand a minimum of a script.There are passages that clearly could have been avoided, such as the ""animal cracker"", which even became an integral part of the film's original soundtrack. The passage is nothing more than a sequence of previously made clichéd dialogues to be used as a flashback at the end of the film to make the audience emotional. A very ordinary resource, by the way, but it works well with the weakest souls. But the question remains... To what extent should we reveal matters of this level in a film like this? When you watch a children's film, it is clear that you are not so strict with certain aspects when judging the film, after all, they are completely opposite proposals. If those who watched the film expecting to see something that a disaster film of this type has never been able to present, will certainly be frustrated by the experience. In a film like this we must go without preconceptions that we will be able to find the grace of the production and even get emotional in one or another scene, as in a beautiful final sacrifice in favor of the humanity of a certain character.The writing team crafted a perfect blend of refined and raw story, including sci-fi, personal drama, romance, humor and a barrage of unusual additives that take this brand of formula to the max. In this big compact impact, director Michael Bay kicks in all the afterburners with turbo boost. Throughout the film, we notice director Michael Bay's fondness for a restless, ever-moving camera. At the beginning, especially in the first scenes, this director's preference gets annoying, making quick cuts and a camera that keeps turning around the characters. All this hinders the understanding of what you want to convey with the scenes.But over time, Bay reduced the use of this resource, using it only in the most frantic action scenes, and this was well done, giving dynamics to the story. But a very noticeable defect is the director's inability to extract feelings from the actors. In scenes with a greater psychological content, such as the farewell to the astronauts before their trip, what happens on the screen does not convey the emotion that it theoretically should... the film suffered from harsh reviews that largely pointed to Michael Bay's direction. About this, the director stated in 2013, during an interview, that he considers this his worst film. ""I will apologize for Armageddon. We had to make the whole movie in sixteen weeks, it was a huge task. That wasn't fair to the movie. I would redo the entire third act if I could,"" said the filmmaker.The visual effects are masterful for an era that had recently perfected the technology to incredibly realistic levels, since ""Terminator 2"" IN 1991. The scenes directed by visual effects supervisors Pat McClung and Richard Hoover bring an absurd realism to the scenes. Big screen. The scenes of the destruction of New York, the first meteorite shower, are simply fantastic and masterfully conducted. An impeccable job for someone who worked with the technology of the time.Today, ""Armageddon"" functions almost as a parody. It's hyperbolic in its patriotism and hyperactive in its editing, but it still manages to work in many ways. Harry's speech to A. J. in the end it still works even without content. The exploration of American imagery throughout the 20th century at the end, showing the nation celebrating heroes, showcases a visual literacy few other filmmakers have. But more importantly, it's almost frightening how effective Bay has been in transforming the tenor of American action cinema, even for those who claim to hate his movies. It's hard to imagine the basic beats and imagery of movies like those in the Marvel Cinematic Universe without their existence. So, Armageddon has value, in its formal innovation and, despite the crudeness of its core concepts, in showing how well the Hollywood production machine can create a unified vision of ideology for audiences to fully embrace.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
How bad was this movie?,"The acting was horrible. The special effects, while exceptional, dominated the movie. The writing was pathetic, and the dialogue was unbelievable. And the silly little love story between Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck was out of place.But the worst offense of ""Armageddon"" was the total lack of scientific reality. ""The asteroid is the size of Texas,"" says Billy Bob Thornton. Er, that's 800 miles wide! No one in NASA even sees the asteroid until a midday meteor shower wrecks havoc in New York? Suuuuure. NASA hires a drilling team to join the astronauts and trains them in a week? Yeah, right. Someone brings a sidearm on the Space Shuttle with them? Yeah, that's realistic.

When are these Hollywood folks actually going to LISTEN to their science-advisors?,"I'll start by saying that Armageddon really wasn't THAT bad, but its still a typical B-type Hollywood flick with more science-mistakes then I can count.Sure, it started out good, but over time, it all just flatted out into a typical CGI-fest, where the special-effects became more important then the story, and where the director just decided to stop listening to his science advisors (if this movie HAD any) and do things HIS way because they ""look good"" and ""sound good"". With all due respect to Americans, this movie was just typical for America - the big bad cowboy riding out to save the world and whatnot.Well, at least the actors did what they could, Bruce Willis did some wonderful work in bringing life to his character, as always, and so did most of the other actors - but the truth is, not even good acting is going to save this movie from me classifying it as ""B-type"".With all the music, and graphics, and fast sequences, the entire movie looked more like a automobile-commercial then a doomsday movie. The plot is cliche, the graphics big and sparky, and everything just too dang typical.

Interesting,"A pretty good story with a decent cast, this film is pretty entertaining. The acting is pretty good throughout and the story is sort of realistic.

There is one word to explain it,"O.K.  Whether you like it or not, you can't disregard Armageddon.  Some listings list the movie as the 13th box office hit of all times.  However, to be more realistic, we can be sure that it's in the first 30's. Yes.  I accept every bad word told about the movie.  That it's not scientifically appropriate, that the plot has weak points etc.  BUT SO WHAT????  Film making is an art form and you can't question the artist if there are people worth $600 million of box office, willing to see the movie. You can not tell the film maker how to make a movie.  Armageddon was made to attract people's attention and it succeeds in it.  You can't deny that.. However, what makes it so successful?  The answer is, IT'S DIFFERENT!!. The idea that an astroid the size of Texas (although scientifically inaccurate), the idea that ""a bunch of retards that General Kimsey wouldn't trust with a potato gun"" go up to space and save the Earth etc..  I can't count them all up but the movie is really different.  The characters are filled with delicate humor and sarcasm.  Also, the plot involves points that lead to very interesting visuals.  They are sending up two shuttles and each take off at the same time, side by side.  And continue on their journey together until they reach the astroid.  NOW THAT'S SOMETHING.  Think about watching two shuttles taking off and making a journey together.  They recreated the mission room of the NASA space center just because it wasn't cool enough.  Also, who can explain me why there are black lights in the shuttles?  Or, why the colors reflecting from the actors' faces change from red to green then to blue in take-off.  SO WHAT?

Worst movie of the year,"""Armageddon"" is directed with so little faith in its audience that director Michael Bay feels he must cut scenes after they've only lived for brief seconds.

Big Hollywood Roller Coaster,"Well, in retrospect, this was a really big movie. There was no match for it in it's time and now it's classic (at least for me).This action/sci-fi was made under probably the most powerful production/direction in Hollywood today Jerry Bruckheimer / Michael Bay with mega cast on stage --Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler, Billy Bob Thornton and Steve Buscemi. All top actors play their parts well, Thornton and Buscemi truly shine.Soundtrack is flawless to say at least, while Trevor Rabin delivers memorable classical theme and brings the atmosphere to every picture (this is his best so far), Aerosmith, Bon Jovi, Patty Smith and Journey bangs out their biggest hits.Film is overly very well made, flawless cgi (nice tackle to Emmerich's Independence Day). Everything nicely explodes and sounds, some small overtones are seen on the asteroid, like those ""in space sounds"", ""in space fires"", low gravity issues, but hell, if it was all made correctly it wouldn't be such a fun. So stop complaining, film-makers know that there is no sound in empty space, no oxygen to burn fires and much less gravity, yet they do it this way.Big time movie.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Mindless Summer Blockbuser.  But still entertaining.,"Armageddon is the story of a team of oil drillers who end up becoming a space crew that must destroy an asteroid the size of Texas which will destroy the earth. There, I just gave you the whole film synopsis in a nutshell. This is one of those flicks where you just have to sick back and enjoy it. You have to throw some of the things you expect from serious filming to the curve because it is obvious that the directors did the same thing.The film defines what a summer film should be. Mindless and more mindless while making the audience laugh and cry. There is a saying that the majority of the nation's moviegoers go to the movies to get a break from reality. Moviegoers want to be shocked. They want to laugh. To cry. To have their life changed. But I digress. On with the review. We have explosions. Explosions. And in case you missed it the first time, more explosions. There are plenty of laughs, witty lines, and funny situations. And unless you're some stone hearted person, the ending of the film will get a tear or two from you. I thought the montage of Harry Stamper's daughter's life(which is in turn his life in a way) flashing before his eyes before he blows up the asteroid(and gives his life as a result) is one of the most touching moments of film I've ever seen. It always makes me emotional. I highly regret not seeing this film in theaters.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Like you are feeling what the character is feeling and like you looking in on your life. A good movie is one when you forget you in a movie theatre and and you forget you are sitting in uncomfortable seat all that you are aware of is that a character is going through a stressful, happy, painful or confusing time in there life and you are right there going through it with them.

I love this move!,"Your realize after watching the beginning of the movie that this kind of story line has been done before, a LOT. However, the cast, the writing, the director and the music are fantastic. I am a huge fan of action movies. This movie is much more than that. It has lines in it that may not have worked as well with another cast. In fact, I think that with another cast, it would been just another cheezy scifi movie. I, truly, cannot think of anything that I would change about this movie. Even the ending was formulaic, but great. It is another good guys vs bad guys movie, except the bad guy is an asteroid.

Gold-Plated Turd,"Simply awful.  I am astounded that 9% of voters thus far saw fit to grant this piece of drivel a 10.

Armageddon is out of this world!,"Armageddon is a movie filled with action, drama, romance, comedy and suspense, basically the 5 things that you need to create an awesome movie. Oh, by the way did I mention it's got an awesome story, here's the scoop: There's a meteor the size of Texas about to crash into Earth, and it's up to Bruce Willis and his team to drill a hole in the meteor and drop a nuke in the hole. Therefore the nuke will explode and Earth will be safe once again. But, the team runs into a few snags for example Harry (Bruce) doesn't really like A.J. (Ben Affleck), even though A.J. is seeing Harry's daughter (Liv Tyler). So complications do occur, however they agree to do the mission. Will they succeed, well that's up to you to see it. Oh speaking of Liv, did I mention that her dad Steven Tyler along with the rest of Aerosmith perform the smash-hit song, ""I Don't Want To Miss A Thing"" on the soundtrack, great song.

"The ""Anti-Independence Day""","Why was this movie even made? It contained nothing original - not that that's always a bad thing. While Independence Day took every Hollywood action movie cliche & wove it into the movie ride of the summer, Armageddon threw all their tired cliches into a blender & came out with a mess. (The screenplay seems to have suffered the same fate cast member Steve Buscemi did in ""Fargo""). I didn't expect much from this film, and I still was disappointed! I couldn't recommend this movie to anyone, except maybe a 10 year old who had never seen a movie of any kind before!

"Big, dumb Hollywood fun","I'm sure there's no one out there confusing Armageddon with something akin to cinematic excellence but there is a certain charm and enjoyment to be had from Michael Bay's box office shattering film that knows exactly what it is and provides its questionable goodness in spades, as Bruce Willis and his merry band of men set out to space to blow up a rock ""the size of Texas"" and save mankind before it's too late.Described by renowned reviewer Roger Ebert as ""the first 150 minute trailer"" due to the films average scene lasting 1.5 seconds when all is said and done, Bay's epic bout of cringe, heroics and sleazy Steve Buscemi is also a four times Oscar nominated Hollywood event that continues to remain popular to this day with TV repeats and diehard fans not letting anything sully their enjoyment of a film unafraid to be what it is, even if its own director and many of its cast members have virtually disowned a product they would all rather put behind them.Featuring an all star cast that's lead by one of the last fun Bruce Willis lead roles and early career moments from the likes of Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler, Owen Wilson and Michael Clarke Duncan, Bay throws everything into his doomed planet event picture as he wastes little time or worry setting up much of a prelude, getting stuck straight into the action as a shotgun totting Willis does his best work on an oil rig that soon leads to him and his trusty band of men (introduced to NASA in a seriously radicle montage) being trained to become astronauts as their sent to space to drill on an active chunk of space rock hurtling towards our beloved planet.Around every corner of Bay's ride is a moment of cheese, a cliché or a zinger from a group of screenwriters that includes J. J Abrams and Tony Gilroy (such gems as ""your wife's gonna be opening your ketchup bottles the rest of your life"" or ""what's up, Harry? Did NASA find oil on Uranus, man?"" are just a few tantalizing examples) and there's barely a moment of respite from the film the seems to revel in its hyperactivity and lack of sensical decisions and there's absolutely reason to believe that for anyone that doesn't get on board with Armageddon's mission, they're going to find this film on their most hated lists much like Roger Ebert.For everyone else, everyone that is just willing to accept Bay's film for what it is, there's a high chance that Armageddon will be the perfect dosage of big dumb fun, much like most the often derided director's entire filmography that when taken in context, is actually a fairly entertaining and memorable one.Final Say -Pushing subtilty out the window and kicking it along once it hits the ground, Armageddon is big, loud, fast and a whole lot of fun and with a loaded cast who should all know better, Michael Bay's out of world blockbuster is still a good time these many moons on from initial release.3 written requests out of 5.For more reviews check out Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I've Seen Razor Commercials With More Depth,"Looking through the IMDb trivia section I see that Ben Affleck can up with the conclusion that it might be easier training astronauts to be drillers rather than training drillers to be astronauts , but then was told to shut up after pointing this out to the producers . Hey I thought this too and I'm sure that everyone who hated this dumb movie thought the same . When the cleverest person on the set is Ben Affleck you know the movie is heading for disaster . That's just one aspect that's wrong with the script , there's plenty of more like the sketchy and clichéd characters , the scientific blunders and the unrealistic scenario - A bunch of redneck oil drillers attempt to save the earth by travelling to an asteroid , just think about that for a moment and see how the concept quickly collapsesBut it's Michael Bay's directing that's the major problem . It really is amazing and not in a good way with the camera locking on to characters when they're not doing anything , and too many slow motion sequences during undramatic moments , then when the action does start to hot up the camera intercuts between the action scenes far too quickly . This problem of Bay's style isn't as bad as the director's latter PEARL HARBOR ( But could Bay direct a worse film than PEARL HARBOR ? ) but it is very evident here . And seeing as I've criticised the script for it's lack of science much of the problem is down to Bay as much as the screenwriters . What fireballs on an asteroid with no atmosphere ?There are two things that Armageddon deserves credit for1 ) The special effects are very good2) It makes DEEP IMPACT look like a masterpiece in comparisonBut you do get the impression from watching this film Michael Bay would be better suited directing commercials for macho products like razors and aftershave .

Has anyone seen this movie without a chip on their shoulder?,"Sometimes I wonder about the people who watch movies and those who comment on them.  This movie was never meant to be the end-all scientific question/debate/answer on the subject of asteroids.  I find it interesting that many of the people who complain about the movie either find fault in nonexistent problems (cups of coffee falling in space - that was back at NASA!) or they assume things they know nothing about.  The solar system is a big place, and asteroids four times the size of Texas are found at regular intervals much less ""just"" the size of Texas.It's true, this movie jumps around a lot.  But they have a lot of story to cover.  And, i'll say this for the movie, unlike Deep Impact - which is just as cheesy, this movie does keep your attention riveted.  From it's comedy to it's music, to the shifting scenes, to the actors themselves, everything happens right after another.This movie fulfills in some part a fantasy of many people.  Being called to save the world because they know something other people don't.  Sorry to ruin your theories guys, but NASA astronauts don't know everything.  Often they are trained and trained and trained on specific tasks for years - just to eliminate mistakes.  When you've only got eighteen days to train someone to do something important, you want to pick someone who's good enough to handle unforeseen problems that might arise.  Drilling a hole in space isn't like rock collecting, it's something that requires skill and practice.Some science critics apparently haven't watched the movie before they complained about it.  The moon is far more than a thirty minute trip. Truman tells the astronauts good morning.  That means a day has gone by. Gravity, even if it is far less, still works in space.  ""Heavy"" - i.e. massive objects will still ""fall"".  I admit the sounds was extraneous, but who complains about sound in Star Wars?  And for people who argue that NASA would never run a mission like this, think about it.  How many times has NASA had to identify, plan, and execute a mission in 18 days?  How many times has the Earth truly been in danger of existence-threatening events?My only complaint was the scope of the movie.  It tried to do too much while still keeping it exciting to the average viewer.  As a result, scenes are cut until they're only on a shot for a few seconds and then the camera is off to the next scene.  It's hard to believe how much they actually do in such a short time, but its effect is measurable.  This movie just keeps on going.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It's pretty bad.,"Let's forget for a second that a comet wouldn't hardly put a small dent in to an astroid the size of Texas and that the chances of a comet hitting an astroid are rather slim. Also, let's forget that there are no astroids the size of Texas in this solar system. So right off from the start; the movie is too stupid to be taken seriously. Anyone who really understands physics and astronomy will have a good laugh at this movie's expense.Let's move on to all that other stuff in a movie (story, characters, special effects). All of them are poorly done and some of them are at an absurd level of silliness. Yet, you can tell that the director is taking this movie seriously and expects us to.

The plot is simple and compelling: Earth will be destroyed by an asteroid unless Willis and his crew, with some interesting astro & cosmonauts flying the ultra useful and dependable space shuttle(Peter Storer as a whacked out Russian cosmonaut, great), to drill a hole in the asteroid and blast it in two with a hydrogen bomb.Real basic stuff, good action and special effects and it's unpredictable. Eliminate the Ben Affleck - Liv Tyler love angle, she plays the boss's daughter, and the drecky song by Aerosmith, replace it with more action, and the movie would be 2x as good.

This movie isn't trying to be APOLLO 13, or anything like that. It's supposed to be entertaining, which I thought it was. I didn't see DEEP IMPACT yet, so I can not compare the two, but I thought ARMAGEDDON was a great film.An asteroid the size of Texas is heading straight for the planet Earth. When it hits, everything on the planet, even bacteria, will die. NASA, in a desperate attempt to save the planet, calls Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis), an expert driller, and his elite driller group of unlikely heroes (includes Will Patton, Steve Buscemi, Michael Duncan) to go on a mission to drill a hole in the asteroid, place explosives in it and destroy it before it hits Earth. A.J. (Ben Affleck), who is engaged to Harry's daughter Grace (Liv Tyler), struggles to earn his respect. Nothing on the asteroid goes as planned, and the survivors of the team must work together to save the planet.The plot doesn't have realism going for it, but it does have some great entertainment and special effects. This is probably the ultimate summer movie smash! The acting is pretty good too. Bruce Willis, Liv Tyler, Ben Affleck and Billy Bob Thornton all do a terrific job.

Misfits save the world...again,"It started with ""The Dirty Dozen"" and continues to this day: a group of misfits, rejects, outcasts, lowlifes, and undesirables possess a unique skill set required to save humanity from destruction. The situation, as always, elevates the misfits over the mindless bureaucrats who reluctantly have to turn to them.Bruce Willis is Harry Stamper, the world's best oil driller. He is called upon by NASA, in the persona of Billy Bob Thornton (Dan Truman), the red-tape cutter who assembles our heroes. Keith David (Lt. Gen. Kimsey) plays to type as a Colin Powell clone whose orders are to destroy the mission whenever possible, while William Fichtner is Col. Sharp, a bureaucrat at heart who still thinks when necessary. Stamper's crew includes the men from his oil company, an ensemble of Ben Affleck (A.J., his future son-in-law), Michael Clarke Duncan (""Papa Bear,"" a jolly black Giant), Ken Hudson ""Quiznos Baby Bob"" Campbell (Max, a grown up, dumbed down version of Bob), Owen Wilson (Oscar, the space-cadet geologist), Steve Buschemi (""Rockhound,"" and the guy you know your daughter will talk to despite your warnings), and Will Patton (Chick). These men have worked together for years and are like family.The ""armageddon"" project is based on current events, namely the realization that it's only a matter of time before earth is struck yet again, with most life forms not surviving. In the movie, there is 17 days to train the crew, fly them to the asteroid, and have them drill an 800 foot hole, into which a nuclear warhead is detonated, hopefully splitting the asteroid. Along the way, they pick up Peter Stormare (Lev), the Russian space station cosmonaut who gives the mission its international flavor, while reminding us that Russian astronauts are superior to American oil drillers.The cinematography is what makes the film work. The plot plays out very predictably, as most movies of this type do.

Will Michael Bay Ever Change It Up?,"By no means whatsoever was this a good movie but you have to admit, it was never intended to be.

Michael Bay is just one of those directors who puts on a show for the masses. I don't think it's all that different than Roland Emmerich or even James Cameron and Steven Spielberg. Don't get me wrong, Cameron is far more skilled at story telling and at redefining the movie experience but you'll never see Cameron do a Scorsese type movie. Spielberg does the same thing. Heck, he exec produced Transformers which Bay directed. Spielberg just has a unique talent when it comes to almost all kinds of movies. He's not type cast while Bay is pigeonholed.My one complement to the film was the ending.

"Hopefully, this is as ridiculous as this genre will get.","Βay and Bruckheimer have created this film based on what they think the public wants to see, not based on a story or message that they want to convey. In far too many respects, I get the feeling that plot elements, dialogue, or settings are inserted because of their mass appeal, and how they will look in 30-second TV spots. This is to action films what ""Moonraker"" was to the James Bond series: an utter contrivance, in which characters and logic are sacrificed in order to set up an unlikely but visually spectacular situation. Just as Bond was returned to his roots in subsequent films, we can only hope that those responsible for this film realize that they've pushed the envelope (and their luck) far enough. Now that we've narrowly avoided extinction from an incoming Texas-sized cliché, one hopes that the next film from Bruckheimer features a better plot and more intelligence, not a bigger disaster with a dumber redneck hero.

"I did want to close my eyes, I did want to fall asleep","Stumbled across ""Armageddon"" the other night on Foxtel, and with little to do and my brain reasonably empty, decided to rewatch it. When I first saw this at the cinema back in 1998, I remember thinking it was one of the dumbest films ever plus I was completely fed up with the ""natural disaster"" genre that was drowning society. Would time change my perception? ""Armageddon"" deals with the question ""what would happen if a meteor bigger than earth hit earth?"". For some reason the US discovered this threat and decided they alone could come up with the answer. Their solution was to send a bunch of misfits who drill for oil into a spaceship to land on the meteor, drill a huge hole in it, then send a nuclear bomb inside it and blow it up from the inside. Genius.NASA enlists the ""world's best driller"", luckily also American Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis) to come and help select the best drill and a plan to get the bomb into the meteor. Harry thinks it will be easier to use his crew who he's used to working with, rather than professional astronauts and scientists. Reluctantly NASA agrees and starts training the crew for the most important job ever in the world. During and after the tests it's clear the team isn't up to it, but they go anyways. Will this cast of misfits save the world? Take a wild guess.Worth watching for the pure comedy factor, if you can overcome the normal US arrogance and ridiculous storyline. A solid cast, given little to work with, covers a multitude of flaws, most noticeably the crappy Aerosmith theme song. Gets bonus points for Pete Stormare who plays the Russian astronaut.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Best of the Year,"Armageddon was a truly awesome movie, my favorite of the year.  It's Michael Bay's 3rd movie after Bad Boy's and The Rock both of which were two of my favorite movies of all time and this movie definitely makes him my favorite director.  What did I like about the movie? I liked how the characters were pretty much normal people as opposed to experts who had been preparing for something like this their whole life.  I loved the special effects.  In my opinion this movie has is no.3 of all time as far as special effects in a movie (no.1 an 2 goes to Titanic, and Independence Day.  All the actors in the movie did a good job(it's Bruce Willis's best role so far) and Steve Buscemi was hilarious , and is one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood. One seemingly minor thing I greatly enjoyed was the fact that it was a very patriotic movie, yet also was able to show what was going on around the world. Most of the scenes were done well.  The ending (which I won't spoil) is very touching, and there are about three of so scenes of glimpses of what people around the world were doing, and these were done so well(especially the one where the president was making his speech at the same time) they almost made me cry.  People say this movie isn't realistic, but what makes them such experts?  Have they ever been in a situation where an asteroid the size of Texas was going to hit the Earth and wipe out humanity? There could have been some things that weren't campletely probable, but you could say that about 99% of all movies out there. If you havn't seen this movie get off your ass and see it this second!  If you're in the mood to be entertained you probaly will be.Rated PG-13 for disaster violence, profanity, and sensualityRating:95/100t",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It has acouple problems but nothing anyone will loathe,"Back around the late 1990s, Hollywood started becoming obsessed with making movies about the end of the world. Some of which bordered on the edge of unrealistic while others wanted to really scare the crap out of its audience with what sounded and looked like plausible science. Whether it be shifting plate tectonics like Volcano (1997) or the devil himself in End of Days (1999), someone thought up of some way the world would end. For director Michael Bay, his idea was more patriotic, although perhaps a little too self-righteous. Although the plot of the movie is not mentioned to be in accordance with the Mayan calendar, the way it comes across is pretty much ""the end of the world""-ish. What's more surprising is that Michael Bay finds this to be his worst movie. I think he should check his list again.After NASA discovers a gigantic meteor the size of Texas is headed towards Earth, the head of NASA named Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton) orders the recruitment of oil driller Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis) to head up to space to knock the ""global killer"" out of orbit. Stamper accepts but only after the rest of his drilling crew comes with him. The rest of the drilling crew contains AJ Frost (Ben Affleck) who's also dating his daughter Grace (Liv Tyler), Chick (Will Patton), Rockhound (Steve Buscemi), Bear (Michael Clarke Duncan), Max (Ken Campbell) and Oscar (Owen Wilson). The supporting cast also includes William Fichtner, Jessica Steen, Peter Stormare, Keith David and Jason Isaacs. Thankfully, for a cast this huge Michael Bay had some credible writers for this production. Penning the official screenplay for this film was none other than Jonathan Hensleigh (Die Hard: With a Vengeance (1995) and Jumanji (1995)) and a young J.J. Abrams. As a whole, the story is proficient at working with what it has. Most of the characters mentioned prior do have a definitive personality and also portray genuine emotion.Then again, there are some moments that hint at the typical Michael Bay shtick that always feels unnecessary. Being that the movie is 2 and a half-hours long, there definitely could have been some trimming on the sides. Some scenes either had no relevance or meaning to the story and did not further the plot. All they did was emphasize how silly some characters can be written. Most likely the running time could have been cut down to 2 hours. The only other part that wasn't needed was the love subplot going on between AJ and Grace. It felt forced and clichéd. Making matters worse was Liv Tyler's acting ability. She wasn't horrible but she had a very stiff face and in some cases she became quite obnoxious portraying her character. Delightfully, there are enough supporting characters to make-up for her. The most interesting belonged to William Fichtner's role as a space astronaut caught between his code by NASA or what his gut says. His exchanges with Bruce Willis are quite the attention grabber.The most entertaining act of the film (and rightfully so) is the final act. It is there that we see Harry Stamper and his crew work as a real team and seeing that happen and how they handle various situations is an intense ride from beginning to end. This also goes pretty much for the cinematography and special effects. All of which blended in nicely as well. The director of photography for this production was John Schwartzman and for what was depicted on screen, it still holds up today. There are large wide panning shots of landscapes but most of it belongs to the meteor, which does look heavy on CGI. Again though, the special effects are something to admire too. For it's time, it could have looked a lot worse but even today it still looks decent.Musically related, the score was composed by Trevor Rabin. Rabin, who's main forte is in the synthetic aspect of film score, does not deviate from what listeners would normally hear. Much of his music contains the same kind of generic electronic keyboard rhythms and action cues. Surprisingly however, Rabin provides a very memorable and emotional power anthem that acts as the movie's main theme. Although there was no Armageddon 2 (and hopefully never will) the fact that Rabin made such a memorable theme for the movie is commendable. It has a very heroic like tune that makes the jobs being done truly feel a difference is being made. As a recommendation for anyone looking to collect Rabin's score, the best would be to go with the bootleg edition. Most of Rabin's score do not contain more material than 30 or so minutes. But the bootleg for Armageddon (1998) is a little over an hour and a half. It's hard to find film scores with such detail so if you can get a hold of it, I suggest you do.Like other Michael Bay films, it has a few areas that needed trimming with unnecessary scenes that make the movie longer than it needed to be. Plus, Liv Tyler's acting is noticeably irritating on screen. Other than that, Bruce Willis and the rest of the supporting cast work well, the music is recognizable and the third act to this sci-fi nail biter is quite a ride.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"A pretty good movie, until they take off into space.","You've got a disaster movie about an asteroid coming straight to Earth and a possibility of killing all human kind. Than you put Bruce Willis in the starring role and cast a wide collection of colorful supporting characters. With all this, it would be impossible to make a boring movie. In fact, this was beginning to be the best disaster movie since the Poseidan Adventure, but then they took off into space and this movie went all to hell. Bruce Willis basically plays himself as the best oil driller on Earth and is called up to destroy the asteroid heading to the Earth. Of course, Willis needs his crew to get the job done. Ben Affleck is a good young actor, but he needs to choose better roles, because all he does in this movie is place himself as a teen idol stud and not a promising actor. I think Liv Tyler is highly overrated not only in looks, but also abilities. Consider that Tyler was out-acted by Alicia Silverstone in the Aerosmith videos, that is very sad.Thankfully, led by Will Patton and Steve Buscemi, the rest of the crew is wonderful and sets this movie off with a bang during an excellent first half of the movie, showing them training and pulling off non-stop comedy and intelligent dialogue. But like I said before, than they had to take off. As soon as you see space in this film, it takes a huge nose dive. At this point, Billy Bob Thornton gains a big chunk of control in this movie and that isn't good. Thornton did a great job in Sling Blade, but since that he has virtually done a terrible job in anything since and this is no exception. The whole space mission is hobbled through the fact that too much happens with questionable possibilities. Buscemi goes AWOL, but somehow becomes a hero. Than you have to see Willis meet his fatal ending. It really sucks to see Willis die in anything. Plus, was it just me who notices that there space outfits change colors all the time while they're up in space? I don't know what they were thinking when they did the last hour or so of this film, but it seems like there were two directors and screen writers on this film. This movie is headed into history as being a great disaster film and turns into just a fun movie to watch for a while. Bruckheimer has yet to find anything as good as Top Gun still.

""How can you POSSIBLY hate this movie?""Let me count the ways:ONE is for the fact that ""Armageddon"" proposes that it is easier to train a bunch of oil drillers to be astronauts (without a single one failing any test, and with a deadline set by a gigantic asteroid about to knock us out of orbit and send us screaming into the center of the sun) than it is to show a professional space team how to operate a drill.TWO is for the destruction of New York City being practically forgotten after it happens.  You'd expect something like that to at least make the national news in a few seconds but there's no mention of it once we're on the oil rig in the next scene.THREE is for the introduction of Bruce Willis' character.  He's supposed to be the hero.  The audience isn't going to like the hero all that much if, the first time we meet him, he's chasing his daughter's boyfriend with a massive shotgun.  (Well, you wouldn't THINK the audience would like him.)FOUR is for how a single character dies in ""Top Gun"" (the Bruckheimer/Scott movie I actually like) and we're bawling, while the entire population of Paris is wiped out in ""Armageddon"" and it barely raises an eyebrow.FIVE is for how everyone I've met enjoys this movie over ""the Truman Show"", which is like preferring the taste of dog food to Filet Mignon.SIX is for how there's Earth normal gravity in the space station and the asteroid unless the plot requires for it to be less, so Ben Affleck can play Evil Knevil.SEVEN is for how there are Dramatic Sunsets everywhere on Earth at the same time, ignoring time zones and the International Date Line.EIGHT is for the Inevitable Red Wire/Green Wire Bomb Disarming Scene.  First of all, I'm not a detonation expert but I'm pretty sure government issued bombs do not follow this pattern.  Second of all, *ahem* THE GUY TRYING TO DISARM THE BOMB BUILT THE DAMN THING IN THE FIRST PLACE!!! Shouldn't he know how it works?NINE is for the Touching Finale where a character must sacrifice himself so that he can set the bomb off, exploding the asteroid and saving the planet. So why in the heck does he feel it necessary to give a Big Long Soliloquy AT THE LAST MINUTE, THREATENING EVERY SINGLE CREATURE ON THE PLANET WITH AN AGONIZING DEATH, so he can say farewell to his friends?!?TEN is for that damn Aerosmith song.  It's their only number one hit.  Of all their songs, that Dianne Warren penned tripe is the most popular.  I'm going to cry.""Armageddon"" gets a big fat two stars, for the sake of inspiring a good parody on ""Futurama"" once.  I'm grinding my teeth over giving it even that much.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Even Bruce Willis can be good once in a while (Pulp Fiction, 12 Monkeys). But, this whole movie is just a big formulaic, predictable, melodramatic turd. How can a movie that was this expensive to make with a massive special effects budget and all these talented actors be SO utterly boring and just plain bad? It is so very, very BAD. It must be the Michael Bay touch. He has to be the worst American director of his generation. He is to America what Uwe Boll is to Retardland or wherever the hell he comes from. I've got a great idea! An action-horror film directed by Bay and Boll! It would star Steven Seagal and Sandra Bullock with Whoopi Goldberg as the comedic relief!

Underrated Masterpiece,"After a meteorite storm ravages New York City, NASA discovers that an asteroid the size of Texas is speeding toward Earth. With just eighteen days before impact, NASA executive director Dan Truman (BILLY BOB THORNTON) discovers that he has only one viable option -- to drill a hole in the asteroid and then plant and detonate a nuclear bomb hoping that the internal explosion will split the rock into two pieces that will miss Earth. Thus, Truman enlists Harry Stamper (BRUCE WILLIS) and his deep core oil drilling team, known to be the best in the world. Harry's got other problems, however -- most notably trying to keep one of his gung ho workers, A.J. Frost (BEN AFFLECK) ,away from his beautiful adult daughter, Grace (LIV TYLER). Even so, Harry realizes he has to go and save the world and agrees to do what he can. Thus, he and team -- which includes Frost; his best friend, Chick Chapple (WILL PATTON); a squirrelly geologist, Rockhound (STEVE BUSCEMI); big man Max Lennert (KEN CAMPBELL); and an odd assortment of other characters train for their dangerous mission.Blasting off into space aboard two space shuttles, Harry and his team are accompanied by NASA astronauts Colonel Willie Sharp (WILLIAM FICHTNER), co-pilot Jennifer Watts (JESSICA STEEN), and mission specialist Gruber (GRAYSON McCOUCH). There they dock with a Russian space station where cosmonaut Lev Andropov (PETER STORMARE) joins them after a calamitous accident. From that point on, the assembled team races toward the asteroid. Encountering various obstacles and bureaucratic blunders back on Earth, Harry and his team race against time to drill eight hundred feet into the rock, plant the nuke, and blast off before the asteroid plummets into the Earth, completely destroying it in a fiery Armageddon. This is a great film and one of the best that came out this summer with a great mix off action,comedy and drama and much more entertaining than DEEP IMPACT and if you like Michal Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer then you will not be disappointed.

*This* was the highest-grossing film of 1998?!?!?,"Well, they say that when you watch/read science-fiction, you have to leave your disbelief at the door...but this was ridiculous.  Armageddon was one long, continuous, unbelievable scene.  In the opener, a meteor falls from the sky, scoring a direct hit on a large Polynesian man, causing an explosion powerful enough to heave cars into the air, but miraculously leaving unscathed the 10-pound, so-ugly-he's-cute dog with which he'd just been fighting, as well as its owner.  From that scene, I knew my eyes were in for a painful ""oh, you gotta be kidding me"" rolling experience.  And I never did get past the fact that I was asked to believe that NASA could put together a mission to simultaneously send *two* space shuttles out past the moon to blow up an asteroid ""the size of Texas"" with one nuclear warhead (okay...they sent two, but only one was expected to be needed and, in the end, actually used) with only 18 days to work with, from the first moment they even realized they had a problem, to the end of the mission.  Come on...these are the guys who need a couple of years of planning to send one shuttle into earth orbit!  That's why we have four shuttles... so they can be rehearsing three, while one is actually putting on the show.Maybe I would've enjoyed the movie more if it hadn't been so predictable. But, not once in the entire movie did anything surprise me...from the deaths of the peripheral characters, to the time-worn use of countdowns reaching their final seconds before success is achieved.  My God, they even had a ""which wire should I cut to defuse the bomb?"" scene!  I thought we put that to rest in the Lethal Weapon series.  This is supposed to create suspense? The group I was with formed a quick pool to guess what the timer would reach when they finally shut the detonator down (""what do you think?...less than a second left?  2.4 seconds?  more than 5???"").  But was there ever any doubt that they'd defuse it?  No...not really.And I'm not even going to go into the physically-impossible special effects. I'll leave that to the people who went home after the movie and worked out the actual gee-forces that would be involved in the slingshot maneuver around the moon.  I'll just say to any director out there...please...just once in a science-fiction movie, don't let a space ship swoop and dive around asteroids, like some high-tech Piper Cub.  Space shuttles have wings so they can land, once they return to Earth...other than that, they have no use, because there is no air in space!Okay...mama always told me, if you don't have something nice to say, don't say anything.  So, on the plus side for Armageddon was Steve Buscemi's comic relief.  He actually looked like some schmuck who was pulled off the street and asked ""wanna go up into outer space?"" and had the time of his life doing it.  Liv Tyler was cute as the lone female voice in the Boys' Club.  I'm more impressed with her acting every time I see her in a new movie.  I hope she gets a shot at some truly dramatic roles someday soon, to see what she can do with them.  Bruce Willis played the same character he's played in every other successful movie he's ever done, and he does it well.  But, other than those, the other characters were derivative and predictable.I just didn't see what all the fuss was about.  They could've done this as a remake of John Wayne's Hellfighters, saved about a gazillion dollars on useless special effects, and *really* turned a profit.  Or...maybe ""Hellfighters In Space"" was what they were going for in the first place.  If so, they tried a little too hard.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

It does the job it says it will do, the effects are adequate, and the characters are funny.  I strongly advise that you take some aspirin before and after you see it, because this movie is a pounding assault on the senses.  I'm glad I didn't see it in a theater because everyone I talked to said that it was way too loud.  I laughed when I read that Disney executive Joe Roth said that they probably wouldn't have made this movie if they would've known how expensive it was going to cost.  I think what he MEANT to say was that they wouldn't have made it if they knew it was only going to make 200 million dollars in the U.S., because that was probably how much it cost.  No doubt they were expecting a $300+ million super blockbuster like ""Independence Day"" or ""Jurassic Park"".  Poor babies.

A guilty pleasure of mine,"I've always kinda liked this film. Sort of a guilty pleasure of mine. The script is cheesy in parts, but the film makes up for that with thrilling outer space/end-of-the-world drama.NASA has only one chance to blow up an asteroid that threatens all life on Earth. One chance to do it and do it right. We feel for the guys sent on the mission, but at the same time we know that if they can't get the job done, the entire human race will be wiped out.There are parts of the movie that will make you start to tear up. These ordinary men are sent on a dangerous mission to save humanity, and (minor *spoilers*) not all of them come home safely. One particular tragedy is especially sad. But then the film comes back with some uplifting moments as well.There's also plenty of Michael Bay explosions and grand scale destruction.I can understand the complaints people have with this film. I noticed a few myself when watching the movie for the first time in years. Some of the dialogue is cheesy, the romance (particularly the ""animal cracker scene"") doesn't really work, there are too many clock-ticking-down-to-one-second scenarios, and a lot of scenes are overly sentimental (with dramatic slow-motion). I can see these flaws, but the fun and the thrills balance them out for me.(One gripe that I can't agree with is the film's lack of scientific plausibility. No sound in space? No explosions? In a film like this, scientific accuracy is not what's important to me. I don't expect to find realism. The movie is entertaining the way it is.)The cast includes several familiar faces (Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Ben Affleck, Owen Wilson, Michael Clarke Duncan, etc.) and the ensemble is kind of fun. (Though I've never been much of a Liv Tyler fan.)If nothing else, the movie is worth watching for the performances of Steve Buscemi (as a borderline insane maybe-genius) and Peter Stormare (as the crazy Russian cosmonaut). Buscemi is great.While it's not perfect, there's a lot to like in Armageddon. It's a fun ride and a classic ""save the world"" epic. I'd rate the movie about a 6, but I couldn't help but enjoy certain parts enough to bump my final grade to a 7/10.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Zero Barrier,"A big budget movie about comets or asteroids threatening to devastate our dear planet should be able to have strong visuals of outer space and catastrophic events. And in that regard, all such movies have a problem. They exist in a world where Michael Bay has already done his thing. ""Armageddon"" is so visually powerful it is difficult to praise it, because you just can't help but stare at that screen in awe. However, two things deserve criticism in this spectacular picture. One, some symptoms of what would later become known as J. J. Abrams' cinematic light tricks ""Star Trek"" and ""Star Trek into Darkness"" are now easily associated with. Here, thankfully, it isn't a problem yet. Two is just how much is happening on the screen. It's like somebody saw 1998's ""Deep Impact"" and rightfully thought that movie didn't pay enough attention to the visual power, so they made a similar movie, and overcompensated a little. ""Armageddon"" looks brilliant, make no mistake, but it is also over two hours long, and whether you like it or not, there simply is more ""action"" than necessary, and you can get a little tired watching it.Scientifically, this movie is regarded as one of the terribly inaccurate. But jumping to conclusions, no matter how many years after the release, could be a mistake. First, the fact that the team going to space to destroy the huge asteroid consists mostly of oil drillers, not astronauts, is questionable. But is it really a bad idea? There is a huge rock flying our way and it will hit us, and all will die. Nuking it with all we've got will, apparently, fail to stop it. And the solution is to blow it from the inside. For that, it has to be drilled, and then a big bomb will have to be put into that deep hole so it can be remotely triggered. This is life or death for the whole world, so we need the best of the best. And such a drill specialist has been found. Only drilling isn't as simple as one may think, and our hero says he is as good as he is for one reason only, the team he's been working with for a long time now. This does make sense. Of course, going to space is terrible stress for the body and the mind, but these guys are not weak, they've been through a lot, and with some training, they do qualify. Plausible or not, this gets two things done. One, these men are strangers to space exploration, and the audience uses them as the bridge between their reality and the rules of how outer space works. Gravity, temperature, the worst environment imaginable is how one of the drillers themselves, namely Owen Wilson's Oscar chooses to put it. Whether some details are accurate or not, the big picture is crystal clear. And the other thing accomplished here is an entertaining montage of our heroes going through difficult tests to get ready, pressed for time as they are. Imminent disasters or not, Michael Bay in his prime, as director, did know how to handle humor.Apart from the intense and heroic tale the plot has to offer, there are two great details that each play a huge part in the story and can also make you question how this movie can be regarded as one of the most scientifically inaccurate. ""Deep Impact"" does not seem to have the reputation of a dumb movie, and yet, it has nothing like what will be described below. And this can absolutely be spoiler-free. First, the asteroid is coming to us, and at an insane speed. And our heroes are going to face it, they are going away from our planet directly to it, but doesn't it mean they will simply smash into? It does, and that is why they have to approach it from behind. And they will only have one shot at that landing. So, what they will have to do is as follows. The asteroid will be passing by our Moon, and they will fly around the Moon to get maximum velocity possible while at least some of the debris accompanying the huge rock will be temporarily drawn to the Moon by its gravity. They will fly around the Moon and approach the asteroid from behind, they will land on it relatively safely. But will it work? They only got one shot, and the speed will be insane! That is great detail number one. Then, if the nuke is successfully inserted into the rock, there is a time limit. When the charges go off, the big asteroid will be split in two, and if the explosion happens too close to our planet, the pieces will not have enough time to fly sideways, which will bring them both to us, that is why ""Zero Barrier"" exists in the movie. A certain distance from Earth that is absolutely necessary for the planet killer to be blown apart safely. But will it work?",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Heavy on the cheese, but still fun","I'm a sucker for disaster movies. As for ""Armageddon"", I can see why a lot of people dislike Michael Bay films, he pretty much represents the current state of Hollywood big-budget mainstream movies. However, I like to think I'm not a ""film snob"" who automatically hates anything that Michael Bay does just because it is big-budget Hollywood fare. Yes, most of his movies are shallow exercises in corniness; unrealistic, garish, obvious and over the top. The style over substance argument is a valid one. But it is foolish to write off any movie strictly because of where it comes from. And sometimes they turn out to be a lot of fun, and very entertaining. Besides, disaster films just have an inherent corniness built into them, as the all time cheese-fest ""Titanic"" proved (James Cameron gets a free pass, he's still a genius). Truly, since the ""Airport"" and ""Towering Inferno"" movies from the 70's, isn't this really what we should expect from disaster flicks?Probably so, and such is the case with ""Armageddon"", one of the ultimate hokey-but-fun disaster movies ever. I often have to remind myself to judge a movie for what it is, or more to the point what it is meant to be, not for what you want it to be. And using that logic I was able to really enjoy this movie. First of all, you have to admit it's just a fascinating subject. Yes it's been done before (no less than in the same year with ""Deep Impact""), but I can never get enough asteroid/comet stories. They set up the impending doom nicely here and Billy Bob Thornton is excellent as our NASA guide to the end of time. There's very little scientific explanation of the asteroid/comet threat on screen, but they throw us enough bones to get into the story.The problems with ""Armageddon"" lay mostly with the characters. Most of them are kind of annoying. But some of them are very likable (Billy Bob, Bruce, Owen and Will Patton mainly). The special effects may not have been realistic, but they're still great to look at. Lots of corny dialogue, but amazingly there are some genuinely tender moments that pull at the heartstrings as well. The kid with the toy space shuttle, that got me. They didn't really focus much on the social effects of such an event, instead opting to make it an adventure film about dudes landing on a comet. Which is fine, although some of the sequences did drag. And its hard to keep track of all the minor disasters that occur while these guys are trying to stop the big disaster. The biggest problem of all, of course, is the fact that oil-diggers would never replace astronauts on a mission like this. But again, turning part of your brain off is key to appreciating movies like this.""Armageddon"" works because it's fun escapism, that's what it's supposed to be. Not every indie film is a ""gem"", just as not every heavily marketed studio movie is complete crap. Big budget Hollywood still manages to pump out a decent movie now and again. And once in a while a few breakthrough and distinguish themselves from the parade of trash that the idiot studio execs green-light. If you've forgotten this or gotten too ""film school cool"" to remember, go back and watch ""Die Hard"". As for comet movies, if I had to choose, I liked ""Deep Impact"" a little bit more, although it had issues too. Overall, ""Armageddon"", despite its problems, is still worth seeing.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Get an Education, Please!","Science fiction only works if the writer(s), director and producer keep faithful to scientific fact and go off into fantasy where known science ends.  Scenes of space shuttles with no propellent tanks but with burning rocket engines, crackling fires in vacuum of space, drilling tractors armed with 20mm gatling guns.  This is what happens when the writer, director and producer fail to graduate from high school.  This was one of the most absurd films I have seen.  The constant camera movement for the first half of the film was tiresome.  This was an animated comic book for imbeciles.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"For Its Genre, the Perfect Movie","If you don't look too closely, don't think too hard, and let this movie entertain you for what it is, you should enjoy it thoroughly. The only two things I found wrong with this movie are 1) I thought Bill Pullman was supposed to play the president in every disaster movie and 2) it's not southern, it's not midwest, it's definitely not any of the leftover options, in fact he doesn't even use it consistently throughout the entire movie, and I guess it's American of some type, but what the hell is Bruce Willis's accent?Anyway, the fact is, this is a great movie. The pacing is great, it's well balanced, they don't force character development on us yet we still managed to care for the characters, the plot, of course, requires you to suspend your belief in rather large chunks, while the dialogue is a little corny, It's not over the top.All In all, again, For What it's trying to be it certainly I mean so exceeds expectations.

A HUGE downfall for Bruckheimer,"After Enemy of the state and this movie I knew the Bruckheimer happy days were over. After The Rock, Crimson Tide, Top Gun, Bad Boys, B. Hills Cop, Days of thunder, Con Air (I consider it as the last of the Great)and many other great movies he sank into a hole he might never climb out of again. What the hell was this crap. I used to love, no, ADORE the beginning of every Bruckheimer/Simpson movie, you know, the camera over an empty road and suddenly lightning strikes, or now when the camera suddenly turns right into a tree,  because it stood for quality action and entertainment in the best possible way. But after the yoakles, who of course have never been to space, but instead know how to drill deep holes into earth (duuh!)an are so chosen instead of the qualified astronauts, save the world, I lost a great deal of faith in the Bruckheimer/ Bay duo. It was completely lost after Pearl Harbor. Man, Michael Bay really took a nasty turn after Bad Boys an The Rock(both excellent , excellent action movies) The only good thing that came from Bruckheimer after that was CSI-not exactly realistic, but hey, there wouldn't be much of a show if they didn't take over every case they came across. But enough about that. This movie was made for 12 year old's and if you don't believe me, well who's stopping you. Go see it, enjoy the almost 2 and a 1/2 hours of pure idiotism and don't forget to cry at the end like you're supposed to. The middle age man sitting next to me did, I kid you not, and he was the most significant reason why I give this movie 5/10. Hey, if Michael Bay can make adult men cry after this movie( which should definitely be considered as a chick flick, the same as the ever so popular Titanic and Pearl Harbor)he really is a genius.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Armageddon,"Michael Bay watched some Oliver Stone films and decided that Stone kept the camera too static.In a Bay movie, the cameras keep moving, the actors keep moving, sometimes in slow motion. Everything has hyper energy including the American patriotism. Check out how many times the stars and stripes are shown.The story is a spectacle, the words that actors spout are written by a sixth grader.The colour grading is all orange and teal. Ethnic characters are stereotypes. Just watch the opening scene with the black man with a dog. Then the Chinese tourists.There are no actresses in this film, they are babes. So in the oil rig the main character Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis) has his nubile daughter played by Liv Tyler, the only woman in an oil rig. He is shocked that she is sleeping with one of the guys.An asteroid as big as Texas is heading for the planet. It will obliterate all life on Earth, even viruses.The US president does not want to go down in the history books as the man who made the world extinct.So the NASA boffins race against time to send two shuttles to land on the asteroid. Drill a big hole and stuff a bomb inside it. The hope is the asteroid will split into two and miss the planet. It is the reason why NASA wants Harry and his rowdy crew.As inept as this all sounds and I'm sure the science is all wrong. Bay makes a breathtakingly entertaining movie.

Held Back By The Weight Of Its Own Excesses,"The problem with blockbuster films like `Armageddon' is that they want to do everything.  They want heartbreaking romance, pulse-pounding action, gripping drama, slapstick comedy . . . all in the same film.  Trouble is, few films ever succeed in accomplishing this tricky blend of different genres.  `Armageddon' isn't one of them.In a nutshell, `Armageddon' starts out as a disaster epic, with a Texas-sized meteor hurtling towards Earth.  This meteor will obliterate all life on Earth unless a group of oil drillers can somehow fly to the meteor, drill a big hole into the side of the meteor, and blow up the meteor with a sizeable amount of nuclear explosives.  Mixed into this disaster epic is a full-blown romance, comedy, serious, thought-provoking moments, and a smattering of other scenes designed to give `Armageddon' the feel of a true Hollywood epic.  What comes out instead is a true, bloated Hollywood mess.`Armageddon', which at least looks cool and has the superficial sheen of a Hollywood blockbuster, is weighted down by a barely there script and awkward shifts of tone.  It's hard to take a character's impassioned speech about saving the Earth seriously when he's only been cracking jokes about the matter only moments before.  Shifts in mood like this look effortless and natural when they're done right; the shifts between comedy/drama/romance/et cetera in `Armageddon' are labored and forced.The story suffers from major plot holes as well. Forget the logistical impossibilities of `Armageddon'; even simple stuff gets made unbelievably preposterous.   For example, the meteor is the size of Texas . . . but the drillers only have to drill down four hundred feet into the meteor's surface?  Hey, why bother drilling at all, if that's the case? There's a tedious section of the film involving the Mir space station that does nothing but waste film, there's enough crashes and accidents to fill twelve action films, let alone one - `Armageddon' reeks of excess, and suffers because of it.As Harry Stamper, Bruce Willis saves this film from being unwatchable crap. Even if the story's ludicrous, he makes Harry Stamper a quiet, reluctant, slightly believable hero, and more importantly, he makes Stamper somebody an audience can root for.  Willis is good enough to single-handedly pull `Armageddon' out of the trash and make it at least entertaining.  Also good is Michael Duncan Clarke as `Bear' - he comes across as a person, rather than just as a cartoon character, and as such he's someone to root for as well.  Ben Affleck is completely bland and forgettable as A.J. Frost, as is Liv Tyler as Harry Stamper's daughter Grace- considering they're the two romantically linked characters, it makes for a fairly uninteresting romance. If the Harry Stamper character didn't care so much about Grace and A.J., both of those characters would've been a complete waste of screen time.Still, `Armageddon' deserves credit for trying to hit a home run, even if it only wound up with a cheap single.  The movie's still kind of fun, in a mindless, dumb sort of way.  If you're in the mood for a decent, cheesy popcorn flick, rent it, and watch it on a big screen TV with a killer sound system.  But only watch it once, unless you want the plot holes to drive you utterly mad.Grade: B-/C+",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Bad Science Fiction, Great Fiction","This is probably the most emotionally moving movie I've seen since Braveheart.  My brother dragged me to it, and I went back the next night to see it again.If you want to see *science* fiction, ignore this movie.  They seem to have consulted not a single physicist, astronomer, or aerospace engineer in the making of it, so I spent half of my first viewing laughing at the sheer ridiculousity of it.  The rest of the time I cried, making this only the second movie ever to bring tears to my eyes.Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck make an amazing couple.  Bruce Willis is heroic, but not superheroic; his character is more human than most of his action movie characters.  Add in Steve Buscemi and the others, and you have an amazing cast.  The story, and especially the love story between Tyler and Affleck, is well written (once you get past the scientific absurdity of it), and is well played out by the actors.The special effects go without saying, being one of the primary draws of this film.  The score is incredibly well-done, and manipulates the audience's emotions with superb artistry.  The soundtrack, featuring Aerosmith both old and new, seems a bit strange in places, but still contributes to the film's intensity.If you are blessed with the ability of suspension of disbelief, then this will be one of the best movies you see in years.  If, on the other hand, you cannot let yourself sit back and enjoy, you will find this a waste of time and money.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It's a Michael Bay spectacle...so turn off your brain and enjoy.,"""Armageddon"" is a Michael Bay spectacle....which is why I never had any desire to see the thing. But a friend of mine, Angelo, begged me to see it...saying he thought I'd like it. So, as a favor to him, I saw this on DVD tonight. And, as expected, it was huge...with amazing CGI and stunts....and writing which was done by a couple really talented 6 year-olds. Yes...the writing is THAT bad. And, because of that, it falls into the category of a film you watch and enjoy AFTER you turn off your brain.A giant killer meteor is headed to Earth and will wipe out all life on the planet. So, the US government has a plan...to send a bunch of total misfit oil drillers to drill and then detonate nuclear devices to explode the meteor and thus render it harmless. All the rest of the film is filler leading up to this foregone conclusion.To say that the film is ridiculous scientifically is a massive understatement. I could go on and on and on about these aspects of the film. But you can still make or enjoy a film that makes no sense IF the writing is good and the filmmakers are able to make it seem realistic. This didn't happen in this film...mostly because the writing was atrocious. These 'astronauts' are the biggest group of quirky misfits you could imagine...and this totally took me out of the plot. Had they found professional acting folks who were like real human beings and not ridiculous caricatures, then it might have worked....but the whole lot of them were just dumb....terribly written and dumb. I cannot believe that Disney spent THIS MUCH money to make a film but only spent about .00000004% of the budget on writing!!The fact this film won four Oscars doesn't bother me. These were all technical Oscars and the film LOOKS impressive....and I am sure a ton of the huge budget went for this. But what bothers me is that the movie made a ton of money...showing that if you market a film hard enough (and the studio spent more to advertise this than the cost of many films) folks will flock to it like lemmings.Overall, worth seeing for the action sequences....if you can wade through the bad writing that goes along with it. But as one of the cast says in the film, ""Oh god, does it suck up here!"".Oh, and Angelo also recommended ""The Bucket List"", which I saw just before ""Armageddon""....and he's one for two, as ""The Bucket List"" was amazing!

A fun adventure,"In 65 million BC, an asteroid is hurtling towards earth, making a devastating impact. Charlton Heston narrates: ""This is the earth at the time the dinosaurs roamed a lush and fertile planet. A piece of rock just six miles wide changed all that. It struck with the force of 10,000 nuclear weapons. A million tons of dirt and rock hurtles into the atmosphere, creating a suffocating blanket of ash and dust the sun was powerless to penetrate for 1000 years. It happened before. It will happen again. It's only a matter of when.""In the present, the shuttle Atlantis is destroyed in space by a meteor shower. Not knowing what's heading their way, the US upgrades to DEFCON 3. The meteors bombard the north Atlantic, with massive destruction shown in New York.

"Well done movie, but not good storyline","The latest testosterone-saturated blow-'em-up from producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay (The Rock, Bad Boys) continues Hollywood's millennium-fueled fascination with the destruction of our planet. There's no arguing that the successful duo understands what mainstream American audiences want in their blockbuster movies--loads of loud, eye-popping special effects, rapid- fire pacing, and patriotic flag waving. Bay's protagonists--the eight crude, lewd, oversexed (but lovable, of course) oil drillers summoned to save the world from a Texas-sized meteor hurling toward the earth--are not flawless heroes, but common men with whom all can relate. In this huge Western-in-space soap opera, they're American cowboys turned astronauts. Sci-fi buffs will appreciate Bay's fertilizing of technology, even though it's apparent he doesn't understand it as anything more than flashing lights and shiny gadgets. Smartly, the duo also tries to lure the art-house crowd, raiding the local indie acting stable and populating the film with guys like Steve Buscemi, Billy Bob Thornton, Owen Wilson, and Michael Duncan, all adding needed touches of humor and charisma. When Bay applies his sledgehammer aesthetics to the action portions of the film, it's mindless fun; it's only when Armageddon tackles humanity that it becomes truly offensive. Not since Mississippi Burning have racial and cultural stereotypes been substituted for characters so blatantly--African Americans, Japanese, Chinese, Scottish, Samoans, Muslims, French ... if it's not white and American, Bay simplifies it. Or, make that white male America; the film features only three notable females--four if you count the meteor, who's constantly referred to as a ""bitch that needs drilling',"" but she's a hell of a lot more developed and unpredictable than the other women characters combined. Sure, Bay's film creates some tension and contains some visceral moments, but if he can't create any redeemable characters outside of those in space, what's the point of saving the planet?",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
probably the worst movie of the past 10 years,"I used to like some of the Hollywood action blockbusters of the 80s. They had icons such as Arnie and Sly but I think the action movie in the '90s has plummeted to new depths. The worst of these, I believe, was Armageddon.The plot is shamelessly contrived and pulls off the worst cliches as it seeks to excite viewers. The melodrama is so cringingly saccharine and awful that you actually cannot wait for Bruce Willis to disappear from the screen. Liv Tyler, who had acted admirably in several fine independent features directed by such masters as Bernardo Bertolucci and Robert Altman, regrettably decided to jump onto the commercial bandwagon. This movie symbolises the new Hollywood aesthetic of grand special effects and precious little good dialogue or authentic melodrama. That is the norm these days and I begin to wonder if there is a role in Hollywood for screenwriters. It seems as though they just employ hacks and committees to write the facile scripts. The rest they leave to technology. There is not a single piece of grand, heartfelt human emotion in Armageddon. It just feels empty and bland. I can think of only one good aspect of this movie and that involves Liv Tyler's dad who doesn't even make an appearance in the film. Steven Tyler's band Aerosmith provide a theme song for the movie - a ballad that really soars and at least tugs at the heartstrings a little when the end credits come up.I weep for Western civilization if people like this predictable, cumbersome movie. It stands for shallowness, lethargy, and a decline in the human intellect. I would even prefer to watch the eighth Friday the 13th.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"When your ears stop ringing, listen up.","It gets pretty sad when a movie is bad-mouthed because it has bad acting. Don't get me wrong, I hate bad actors, and if you've read my other reviews, you'll see that I talk a lot about crappy actors.  But those are for movies where good acting is required for the situation to be believable. 'Armageddon' is a movie that does not require good acting.  Michael Bay never said that the movie would have Academy Award winning acting in the movie.  He said it would be an action packed thrill ride.And it was.  The movie was very good, because it kept the action going straight to the end.  It didn't matter if the acting sucked.  But I have to be accurate about this movie:  The acting was half-decent.  I mean, whenever I see bad acting, I almost always laugh.  I never once laughed during this movie, except when the script required me to.  The acting is pretty good. Bruce Willis is not my favourite actor, after all, some of his movies have shown his 'bad actor' side.  But he does a decent job in this movie along with the rest of the cast.And finally, I will say this.  The last 10 minutes of the movie disturb me. They are horrifyingly sad!!  The last 10 minutes of 'Titanic', were nothing compared to this.  I swear, I almost cried!!  It was so depressing, I was tight-lipped for the first few minutes after I left the theatre.  That's amazing.  A movie starring Bruce Willis is sadder than 'Titanic'.Although I should tell you:  I'm speaking hypothetically.  I didn't find 'Titanic' sad.  In fact I laughed!  But I know many people cried their eyes out in that movie.  So if I didn't find 'Titanic' sad, and millions of other people did, and then I found 'Armageddon' sad, what does that tell you? That 'Armageddon' is one hell of a sad movie.So if you're one of those 'Go see an action flick, just 'cause it's an action flick' kind of guys, go see this movie.  If you enjoy good acting, decent story and stuff like that, go see this movie.  If you want to cry your eyes out at the end, go see this movie.

An irritating joke with a ridiculous direction,"If you are a rational person, you will go crazy when you watch Armageddon. This movie is way beyond the poetic justice of Science Fiction and sometimes I wonder how the studio approved such a script. I mean we are not talking about a B-movie here, this is a multi-million dollar project that was advertised as the Sci-Fi event of the decade.Apart from the craziness of sending a bunch of unqualified people on a mission to save the world, there is the well known Michael Bay celebration of the US military forces ('The Rock'). There's also a sad statement that the whole planet depends on USA to find a solution in a crisis. You see, this drilling thing is such a sophisticated procedure that all the nerd astronauts of the world are unable to perform, so Bruce Willis' 'American' oil drilling team were asked to save the day.But what's even more irritating than the script, is Michael Bay's direction. He behaves as someone who's just learned all those cool trick shots and tries to show them off through the entire movie. There isn't one static shot in the movie! Literally! When he's zooming in to a character he uses those trademark Spielberg/Rodriguez techniques and he doesn't know where to stop. Those shots should be used in order to emphasize a line or a critical moment, but he does this all the time! The whole thing is like an enormous music video and after some time it becomes really bothersome.Just a few days before Michael Bay's US military trilogy is completed with the official screening of 'Pearl Harbor' I have one thing to ask: How can a cult personality like Steve Buscemi star in Armageddon?",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I, particularly, liked Ben Affleck's performance, especially at the ending.  Seeing Ben Affleck cry made me sob like a little bi***, and I'm not afraid to admit it because it really touched.

Is it enjoyable? Surely, it is a perfect move to take a date with, or to watch at home while texting and chatting. There are few, if any, inside references or loops on the story. The first 10 minutes give you all the character nuances you will need.As for the special effects, they are nice but thankfully they avoid the ""Independence Day-trap"" of killing even a shallow storyline for the sake of showcasing the ability of its visual effects engineers.To sum it up, Armageddon is a typical summer action movie, not much concerned about complexity.

"If you watch Armageddon, only watch it once. If you see it more than that, you'll realize how terrible it really is.","Armageddon definitely sets the record for fooling the most people into thinking it's a good movie. When I first saw it, I was blown away. I loved every second of it! It was exciting, it was spectacularly done, the acting was great, the dialogue was funny, I couldn't think of a single thing wrong with it. Obviously, I bought it on video. Then I watched it at home, and saw for the first time what an awful movie it is.Armageddon manipulates the emotions of the audience like no other disaster movie ever has. The romantic scenes (like those in The Rock) are clumsily and randomly thrown in (this way it will appeal to women, too, and therefore make more money in the box office). The tough guy acting, particularly (and CONSTANTLY) on the part of Bruce Willis as Harry Stamper, the world's best oil driller, was terrible! There were so many scenes in this film that were thrown in for no other reason than to get a meaningless laugh or broaden the target audience that it began to get tiring trying to figure out which ones actually had anything to do with the story itself.Besides all that, there were also horrible discrepancies in the storyline. Early in the film, Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton) describes the effects of the asteroid collision as ""basically the worst parts of the Bible."" Even the name of the film, ""Armageddon,"" is taken straight from the Bible. Given that, you have to wonder why there are so many times when the characters (mostly Stamper and Truman) ask God for help, ask God for just a little more time, pray that ""God be with them."" Why are they asking God for help?! They just finished pointing out that it was God that sent the asteroid! Why WOULD He help? You can see how the hypocrisy of religion even manages to wiggle its way into Hollywood films.The dialogue of the movie also took a lot away from several of the action packed scenes. The phrase ""She's gonna blow!"" is uttered so many times that by the time the scene's climax is reached it has no effect anymore. The predictability of the ending is also a serious disappointment. Furthermore, the logical errors were a little disturbing. For example, there was moderate WIND on the asteroid, as well as clouds of dust and smoke floating calmly around. That's funny, I thought we were in SPACE traveling at 22,000 mph.As a whole, Armageddon is an edge of your seat action thriller, but there wasn't a whole lot of effort put into it beyond special effects and sheer financial purging. It's never boring, but the structural, logical, and storyline problems take away a great deal from what could have been a spectacular disaster film.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Superb,"Let's be serious, there is nothing particularly realistic about this film. For starters, what are the chances that those asteroids would hit downtown Manhattan!  We can be hopeful of course, but more than likely it would be some obscure part of Russia or Nth Canada.  I am straying from the point. This is an all-American, gung-ho film.  The music (Jerry Bruckheimer music is always similar) provides the hero feeling and seeing them in their flight suits makes us all proud. All in all, the performances were good (Bruce Willis the same as always though).  The special fx were fantastic.  But more than anything, for an action flick I found myself rather attached to the characters.  Especially Bear and A.J.  And I was glad to see they both survived.  I also shed a few tears for poor orphaned Grace, left to survive on her own (with a totally gorgeous fiancee). Overall, I think this was a great film.  A mixture of a completely unrealistic storyline, gobsmacking fx, side splitting laughter, sniffly tissue moments and arm-rest gripping tension all contributed to the best film this year. I would see it again and again.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Makes Independence Day seem subtle and nuanced.,"It's hard to believe that a movie about a bunch of oil drillers taking a spaceship to a comet, with the purpose of blowing it up with a nuclear bomb, could be over the top. But, somehow, it is.The origin of this movie has to somehow involve a bar bet. Jerry Bruckheimer must have wagered Michael Bay that he couldn't make the most overblown sensationalized movie ever. Well Jerry, you owe Michael this time, because he did it.If Mr. Bay were to eat like he directs, then he would easily weigh in at 2 tons. There is not a single scene in this movie that doesn't want to be grandiose, not a single line of dialog that wouldn't be improved with the actor taking a giant bite out of a ham sandwich after delivery.I have actually once been, with a few hundred other people, in a life or death situation. You know what not one person did the entire time? Made a funny or irreverent quip. Can you believe that? Now, I know that this is an action movie, and little one liners are a staple of the action genre. Believe it or not, I love them (two of my all time favorite movies are A Boy and His Dog, and Hell Comes to Frogtown), but his movie exhausted even my patience for them.Try and watch this, if for no other reason than to see what happens when hundreds of people take leave of there senses, and collaborate on what so obviously had to seem like a steaming turd from day one.This movie is like Michael Jackson's face.

I think this could have been a very good movie except they fouled it up by putting in a weak plot. Ok, flying into space to plant a nuke on an asteroid to blow it up may be a little far fetched, but not entirely unbelievable, so does the idea of sending up a drilling specialist to oversee the task. But sending up a whole crew of misfits from an oil rig is totally unbelievable. If the world was in so much peril, do you actually think the government would take a gamble of such grand proportions?

jumpy camera + ADD editing = not good,"I always watch a few minutes of this movie whenever its on, trying to understand the ""hatred"" that viewers supposedly have for Michael Bay films. I never do. I can only ever make sense of it by assuming that the masses need objects for communal hate, just as they do for communal love. In this way, Bay has unfortunately become an emblem of tasteless, disposable cinema. So Steven Spielberg = good, Michael Bay = bad. This mindset is what Orwell called the ""gramophone mind"". In principle there is little difference between the aforementioned two; Steven's films are only slightly less empty than those of Bay.On pure filmic grounds there is just one really huge problem that this movie has, and thats the editing style Bay adopts once we're in space. The jazzy, frayed film-cutting is very unpleasant, and, as it turns out, a poor choice. Because ironically, while its intended to pump up the volume, it actually makes the viewer numb and squanders any excitement the action scenes might generate. Such head-pounding montages add up to over an hour of the film. Other problems include an overkill of gay mano-a-mano moments. Liv Tyler is obnoxious. And, this movie essentially has no characterization; most of the characters are meatheads and have interchangeable dialogue.The money-men haven't held back; this is a massive, massive project. Apparently they got access to actual NASA labs and facilities. And Bay has shot it beautifully for the most part. The creepy asteroid is the most surreal and outlandish place we've been to since since the derelict spacecraft in Ridley Scott's 'Alien'. The Armadillo is as awesome as the Nolan Batmobile. I think that, with some reasonable adherence to space science and a leaner, more well-organized screenplay, this could have been a much more balanced movie. Bay's previous 'The Rock' is better, and also has great humor.The current generation of film viewers is a lazy one, having gotten used to relying on Tomatometer percentages rather than individually analyze & evaluate a film's merits & demerits. Armageddon is indeed an out-and-out corporate product, but it has undeniably inventive visuals. Image is the language of cinema, and if Kubrick is the Kafka of film, beginning the transformation of image grammar, then Bay must be kinda like Dickens, the master of conventional storytelling.The detractors of Armageddon are the equals of Jerry Falwell.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Have you ever heard of Evel Knievel?,"Armageddon is a 1998 science fiction disaster film about a group of deep core drillers who are sent into space to stop an asteroid from colliding with Earth.Now this is not a movie for everyone. If you're a stickler for scientific accuracy or plausibility, then you should probably skip this one. But to me it's an awesome flick with so much action, comedy, and drama that it's impossible to not be entertained. Although there are aspects to the story that make no logical sense, it's packed full of exciting moments and characters that keep the fun flowing all the way to the very end. It's got a fantastic All Star cast that does not disappoint with their performances, and I think the film score is great.I've loved this movie ever since it came out. And if you haven't seen it before and can take it for what it is, there's no reason you shouldn't be able to enjoy it.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Overstuffed but serviceable popcorn flick,"If there is one positive thing about Michael Bay and his movies, it's consistency. From his very first film, it was clear what he was about: explosions, hot women and awkward humor. In almost 20 years, nothing has changed and upon watching Armageddon, it seems like this is probably his purest film marketed to the widest audience possible (since R-rated movies are limited to ages 17 and up).The story is about an asteroid which is headed towards earth. NASA recruits a team of deep core drillers to be trained as astronauts, so that they dig a hole in an asteroid where a nuclear bomb will be placed. Along for the ride is one of the most impressive ensemble casts ever, although a lot of them don't really get to do that much. Most of them are also nothing more than caricatures rather than fully developed characters. The best performances come from Bruce Willis as Harry Stamper, the leader of the drilling team, and Billy Bob Thornton as Dan Truman, the NASA guy who recruits Stamper in the first place. There's also Ben Affleck, Steve Buscemi, Liv Tyler and several other recognizable actors who round out the cast.So, what worked? For starters, the filmmaking and cinematography was appropriately epic and restrained, especially compared to the hyper-kinetic style which Bay was to use with the Transformers movies. With the exception of a few intense sequences, one has a sense of place and the action is fairly easy to follow. This film also has impressive visual effects, probably the best that 1998 had to offer. Of particular note are some outer space asteroid sequences and a nicely done destruction of Paris. There was also rather good practical effects and use of miniatures, which was a nice change of pace from today's CGI-obsessed blockbusters.Moving on to where this movie falls short. One would think that with such a great cast that the movie would be outstanding as a result, and you'd only be partially correct. While the film does have a lot of individual moments that are funny, or touching, nothing really coalesces. Instead of fully-formed characters, you mostly have stereotypes and caricatures, which is rather sad for a movie that lasts 150 minutes. There's also a romantic subplot between Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler that could have been completely left out. Of course, then they wouldn't have had an excuse to include one of the sappiest songs that Aerosmith has ever recorded (and whose lead singer, Steven Tyler, is Liv Tyler's father). There was also some pacing issues, namely that the first hour compresses about two weeks of training, and then the remaining 90 minutes takes place over the course of about one or two days. And of course, we get all the standard Michael Bay-isms. There's a ridiculous amount of explosions, misplaced ""humor,"" leery shots of scantily clad women (from one scene in a strip club), upward facing camera angles and lots of slow motion (although not as much as some of his other work).Put together, the various ingredients which make up a Michael Bay movie do, for the most part, work here. It's not deep, and it's not trying to be either. This is popcorn entertainment at it's finest, and for sheer spectacle this is one of the best summer blockbusters ever made. That being said, I usually demand more of my movies and prefer not to have to turn off my brain very often to enjoy a movie. There are lots of people who absolutely love this stuff, but I'm not one of them. I thought it was passable entertainment, and certainly not one of Bay's worst (I'm looking at you, Transformers 2).",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Armageddon:  The perfect mix of story line emotion and breath taking Action,"I have to admit, the first time I saw Armageddon it didn't exactly take my breath away. I'd been running late that day and came in about 15 minutes into the movie.. so already it was hard for me to get into it.But the second time I saw it, not only was I blown away by the special effects but so was my entire family. I noticed much more of the story between Gracie and her daddy and that's what made it so emotional for me at the end, being able to connect with each character, being able to feel the pandemonium of the impending crises... my heart races, my palms are sweaty, and my eyes are filled with tears at that last second Harry had.. beautiful acting, gripping and intelligent story line- you may say it's not believable, but hell- if it came down to this in real life, wouldn't it be great if some of US were this brave?

"starts off great, all downhill from there","Armageddon is your typical Michael Bay movie: Loud, Stupid, shallow, but ultimately very watchable, humorous and spectacular too.When I started watching this movie, I was not disappointed. The introduction on the oil platform was very funny, and Bruce Willis hitting golf balls into a Greenpeace boat was something that made men laugh loudly. The roles were played well, and it was all amusing. The fun lasted, and lasted, right until the moment that the president gave a speech about how America is going to save the world etc, etc, and the all the drilling idiots got onto the rocket.It all went downhill from there. The silly but fun humor was replaced with gung-ho patriotism, the action scenes were stupid and the events became so far-fetched that not even the most beautifully filmed explosions couldsave the movie from drowning in epic retardation. A sad case because the movie started off quite alright, but ended up being a complete train-wreck.I still give it a six because I found it entertaining, but very shallow and silly and with a poor second half. The special effects, the soundtrack and the way it was filmed (Bay's frenetic, constantly moving camera has been appealing since it worked so great in the Rock, and it has never lost its charm since if you ask me) made up a great deal to me (plus, the first 60% of the movie WAS entertaining, so a 6 is to me quite an adequate grade).",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Well that's two hours I'll never get back.....,"My GOD this has to be one of the absolute worse movies I have EVER seen! Michael Bay is at it again with the 'all style and entirely NO substance' approach.  Its just AMAZING to me that so many big names were involved in this movie and its still THIS BAD!  Talk about asinine!  The whole plot is just ludicrous.an asteroid is coming towards Earth to destroy us all..the only people who could save us?  Oil drillers!  Train them until the absolute last possible day before this big rock hits us and send them up there like astronauts so they could dig into it, drop a nuke, get out of there and detonate the bomb.  This is where the person with sense would say, wouldn't the pieces from the explosion still hit Earth anyway?  Hark!  Bay & Co. have the answers to that one...detonate the nuke before you cross this boundary between it and Earth and the pieces should just miss our planet!  Are you KIDDING ME???I still can't believe this trash was even made.  And the fact that it made as much money as it did bewilders me.  There's escapist entertainment, that still somehow makes sense and is somehow logical, and then there's Armageddon, which is just too stupid and ridiculous to even NOT be taken seriously.  I knew what to expect going in, but its one of those things where you don't think it will ever be as bad as you think it would be.  In this case its even WORSE!  Just how in the hell did they manage to do that? Easy.  By having NO script and a load of talentless 'superstars' (i.e. Ben Affleck).  Ben Affleck was one of the most worthless, stupidest characters I've ever witnessed in a movie.  What was his purpose?.... to just mess everything up and be as inept as possible?  The acting was horrible, which doesn't help the fact that the 'script' is pure nonsense.  Everyone just took the idea of the world ending too calmly..giving Bruce Willis & Co (our 'heroes') ample and frequent times to complain and bicker to each other about stupidness.  Uh, we're here to save the world.maybe this isn't a good time?!?!?!  Could SOMEONE have a BIT of sense here?  Oh, there was the self-proclaimed genius, Steve Buscemi (what the hell was HE thinking??) who was the only logical one until he came down with 'space dementia'. WHAT????This is the perfect example of a movie having all the fancy decorations and brand names to cover up its total idiocy.  What really got me was how the surface of this asteroid was as smooth as newly paved streets for everyone to just drive/stroll around so easily.  I can employ my suspension of disbelief but so far, but the Evel Knievel jump made by Affleck on the armadillo was THE LAST STRAW for me!  I said 'two hours' in my summary because that's how much of the 153 minute drivel of a movie I was able to tolerate before almost breaking my sacred player trying to get the rented DVD out of it (how I removed the disc from my player without breaking it is a mystery).  I didn't see the last half hour or so and I truly don't care to know/see what happens.  I have been scarred for life watching this garbage, though I'm still recuperating from the torturous experience.  From now on I now know to stay FAR FAR AWAY from Michael Bay movies..Pearl Harbor, Bad Boys 2, and now Armageddon???  This takes the cake.

"Well-Made, Misunderstood Sci-Fi","On a rating scale of 0 to 100; I gave Armageddon a score of 74.If you are making an explanation of the ingredients that an 100/100 film would need, it is best not to use Armageddon's flavours. But, if you are making an explanation of pure entertainment at it's best, then Armageddon is a great example to use. This film opened up to the world as a major blockbuster with Razzie potential from some critics. However, some movie-goer's, like myself, happened to enjoy this film, and as a shooting star of a moneymaker, Armageddon soars high in the universe.A giant, global-killing asteroid, like the one that killed off the dinosaurs 65 million years ago is 18 days away from hitting the Earth. NASA's been caught with their pants down and needs a new plan to stop the rock. They enlist the help of Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis), an expert deep core driller, to train their astronauts and help them drill into the asteroid and plant a nuclear bomb. But Harry figures the astronauts can't be trained in time and opts to go with his own oil drilling crew.To get the flaws over and done with, Armageddon is sometimes too far-fetched that it becomes a little bit laughable, and Bruce Willis' character, Harry, is the hero. He isn't likeable one bit, unlike Willis' former heroic gun-aimer's and space travelling characters. But those things are quite minor, and great performances from Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck  especially Tyler, as the beautiful and Earthly young girl who sends her two most important men into sport  make up for Willis' half-effort. Also, a star-studded cast supports the three stars, including the never bad Steve Buscemi, giant Michael Clarke Duncan, the calm Owen Wilson and the weirdly watchable William Fichtner. All these actors play their roles well, and each have more faith in the story than some of the other main stars alone. Michael Bay controls his crew well, and he works excellently with the special effects team to create a stunning view of space, and some awesome blasting sounds that will unnerve you.Armageddon is not as bad as you may of heard, and even though it isn't Best Picture material, it is still an excellent form of entertainment, a film that is able to mix romance, thrills and full-on adventure nicely and without struggle.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Important - if very shallow - 1990s disaster flick,"The Bruce Willis Show. That's what you get in Michael Bay's doomsday thriller. Luckily his commanding performance ties together all the ramshackle plot and character elements as a massive asteroid threatens to wipe out mother earth. The explosions, flashing lights, placeholder characterization, and chop suey editing most associated with Bay's work come to full flower in this picture, and like it or not, this may be the most influential modern film: still showing as inspiration in current blockbusters. The plot? Whatever. Huge asteroid comes for earth. Tough guy oil driller Harry Stamper is called to save the world, with his motley crew of fellow roughnecks, while brash apprentice AJ pursues his beautiful daughter, Grace. Dan Truman, the calm under pressure NASA man, played by Billy Bob Thornton attempts to guide them to success.

Pitiful,"One of those annoyingly overblown films that is far more popular than it has a right to be, this syrupy rubbish succeeded in stealing much of the thunder of the superior Deep Impact.Earth is doomed, and only a group of overbearing Yanks can save us. They're a collection of rogues, criminals, perverts and potential psychos, but they can drill holes well so they're our only hope. Cue a collection of hysterical (!) scenes as they're trained to be astronauts, then shot into space to destroy an oncoming asteroid that's the size of Texas.Bay and Bruckheimer are never names that suggest subtlety or good taste, and true to form after an admittedly impressive opener the movie soon descends into a mess of overly plush special effects and saccharine sentimentality, not least when the doomed inhabitants of Earth gather around their most photogenic national monuments to stare sorrowfully at the sky. No cliché is left unused, no opportunity for a heartfelt dialogue is avoided; these people truly have no shame.The impressive cast is not even worth mentioning. They rattle off the dialogue as if it was written ten minutes before the cameras started rolling. Buscemi in particular was wasted, and it's a sad day when a Bruce Willis character is not even the slightest bit appealing.Quick cuts and confusing camera angles shouldn't be allowed to cover what is essentially shoddy filmmaking.

Obnoxious yet enjoyable,"Armageddon is simultaneously enjoyable and obnoxious. First, the plot is basic and nonsensical. It's a fun premise but requires excessive suspensions of disbelief. Also, the characters and dialogue are lowbrow. Entire scenes exist solely for immature jokes. Most of the broad strokes work (especially the bittersweet ending), but the details are clumsy and contrived. For example, it's nice that Armageddon has an emotional core, but that conflicted romance is shallow. Furthermore, once the space adventure begins, the movie gets into a repetitive loop of exhausting crises. Ultimately, the writing got the big picture right, but was erratically executed.Conversely, the technicals save Armageddon. The imagery gets unpleasant in space, but is primarily cinematic. Its sweeping camerawork and stylized lighting energize the drama. The sound and editing are overdone, but they tackle complex montages and action sequences. The production design is disappointing on the asteroid, yet still elaborate. The significant effects include real explosions. The soundtrack has some good jukebox tunes and an iconic anthem. Plus, the cast is impressive, especially in hindsight. Overall, Armageddon has cheap emotions but sturdy craft, making it surprisingly fair entertainment.

Cinematic Armageddon,"I can't say often enough how bad ARMAGEDDON is. Roger Ebert's review is probably the best ever written about this film: he wrote that it's not a movie but a two hour movie trailer. But ARMAGEDDON is the standard to which every ""Big Budget Hollywood Blockbuster"" stinker is set against. Personally, ARMAGEDDON is even worse than Roland Emmerich's GODZILLA (98) and that travesty was HORRENDOUS, so you can imagine how bad ARMAGEDDON is. The whole idea of getting guys who work on a oil rig to help astronauts destroy an incoming asteroid is stunningly brainless. Seriously, who greenlighted this project? This ""movie"" has absolutely nothing. It's probably the most hollow film experience ever put on celluloid. To make things even more enjoyable, it's jaw-droppingly jingoistic, so much so that I wanted the piece of rock to slam into planet earth  and kill the whole human race once and for all.I've never seen so many actors wasted in one single movie. No one gives a semblance of a performance. It's all posing and screaming and in the very embarrassing for everyone concern. The editing is epileptic. The look of the film is like a Budweiser commercial. The science is unacceptably unscientific, even for an escapist movie. Dialogue that made my ears bleed. And the action was silly. The world is about to end and they go party at a strip club where women throw themselves at them. Sure. The space shuttles take forever to land on the asteroid but it only takes them a couple of seconds to leave it. The asteroid pieces always crash into big cities (NY, Paris, Hong Kong...). The never-ending use of slow-motion shots. Machine guns on the rovers. Why?!?! Did they expect to find nasty aliens on the asteroid? Mind-numbingly loud! I can't stress enough how loud ARMAGEDDON is.

Don't expect art house chic,"Armageddon is a typical summer movie.  When I see the ads for the special effects spectaculars, I don't go and expect to see Citizen Kane.  I expect to be entertained, and loudly.  Armageddon certainly fills the loud requirement, and it fills the entertainment quota as well.  Bruce Willis portrays his typical character, a hard nosed guy who sacrifices a lot to get the job done.  It's the same role as John McClain, Willis' character from the Die Hard series.  Steve Buscemi is a treat in this movie, but Liv Tyler was obviously added for eye candy, as her performance was not very convincing.Armageddon is a great film to watch on a seminal level.

Exciting despite major flaws,"I have to admit a strong prejudice against science fiction films that are so scientifically inaccurate and unbelievable that they are embarrassing to those of us who actually like SF. (Note: Star Wars isn't science fiction, it's fantasy, which doesn't have to follow rules). If I were Joseph P. Allen, the NASA consultant, I would die of shame. If you can't spot most or all of the flaws, then you probably don't care.Besides the above, most of the characters were so forgettable that when they died you couldn't remember what they looked like! Many of the scenes on the asteroid looked like what they were: indoor sets under harsh lighting. I could go on but you get the picture. Brainless mind pap.I must admit that despite everything I still enjoyed watching it (!) because of the off-the-top performances and some (but definitely not all) of the special effects.

"My fix of stupid epic action, trailer dialogue, slow-mo and US flags","This film is a much easier experience if you make one thing clear for yourself - Armageddon is too stupid to be a science fiction film. It's a big-budget dumb 90ties action with a relatable action hero and an emotional side character that will tell the audience how they should feel in a particular situation with her facial expressions. It's pretty much Bay's ""The Rock"" scene by scene but in space.It's pure brainless entertainment. At least it was when it was released.Now, in 2020, a new dimension of entertainment opened itself to the thinking viewers - you can observe and study the genesis of the staples and cliches of now big names like Michael Bay and J. J. Abrams.Michael Bay with his tons of epic-slow mo, explosions, women objectification and USA fetish.And J. J.

Better than its box office implies.,"I think this movie was underrated because of the earlier release of Deep Impact.  This one had a superior focus on character, excellent pacing, crisp script and, of course, first-rate special FX.  Yes, it has its weaknesses, but--considering the genre--they're excusable.  This is the first movie in which I've really liked Bruce Willis.  His performance was perfectly understated.  He, like Harrison Ford, always does well with the ""normal guy thrust into abnormal situation,"" and in Armageddon he does it without the over-the-top, cartoonish elements such as we've seen in the ""Die Hard"" films.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Unspeakably awful,"Being an unrelenting non-stop over-the-top explosive melodrama, this movie is one of the worst action flicks ever produced, and utterly unbelievable in every way.

It is nigh unwatchable, and a stain - nay, a blotch - on the careers of everyone involved.The wildly exaggerated attempt at excitement undermines itself, resulting in a movie where you just go ""Come on!"" all the time.

"A horrible, bloated, and hyper movie","This movie was not an action-packed guilty pleasure (Except for the fact that it's enjoyable to goof on).  It was not mindless fun/entertainment. Go see Face/Off for that.  Armageddon is a fractured, over-stylized mess of not much more than spliced rip-offs of music videos and television commercials. If my memory is correct, as the climax neared, the cutting between scenes increased in frequency.  It got to the point when I didn't even know who was dying or who was surviving on the asteroid, and I was too dazed from the strobe-light effect of the MTV/zero attention span cutting to care. Constant movement does not necessarily equal good action, in my opinion. Therefore, I give this movie a 1.  It is truly awful, possibly the worst movie of all time, and what makes it worse is that it made a lot of money, which has resulted in and will result in more bloated offspring to come.

Yes, you read that correctly.Whether someone reads the preceding summary first or sees the trailer first, one thing is 100% apparent: escapism. This movie is flat out impossible and that is obvious to someone who has virtually no knowledge of astronomical physics. But it is good escapism.

Blink and you'll miss it,"Effectively a remake of the 1978 disaster Meteor, but that film reconstituted through the brain of two overwrought p*ss-artists, namely Jerry Bruckheimer  he who would unleash bangs on us for eternity and his top dollar whore, Michael Bay; not so much a director in the classic sense, more a mechanistic film machine with eyes. In fact if Bay hadn't been seen in public it would be easy enough to believe that his name was a synonym for a directing computer developed by Industrial Light & Magic; programmed to replicate the moves of great helmers like Stanley Kubrick and, er, Paul Anderson but lacking the human capacity for feeling that made those men such warm, intimate filmmakers. But Bay is a man and one with the worst directorial style ever known to 110 years of cinema patrons. His technique, if you're interested, involves substituting movement for drama, music video gloss for decent cinematography, incident for story and ciphers for characters. His co-conspirators, his editor and his composer, give their contractual all to ensuring that every one of his synthetically stylish shots are given at least 2 seconds of screen time and each bang, cant and crane-assisted close-up are accompanied by plenty of plastic pathos.""I don't want to close my eyes, I don't want to fall asleep"" sang Aerosmith's Steve Tyler in the hilariously titled tie-in single ""I don't want to miss a thing"" but you did, you did and you did. With an average shot length of just 0.4 seconds, your ability to watch Armageddon is a lottery based on your pattern of blinking. This is deliberate so that having only registered about 45 minutes of screen time in a single sitting, an audience would be forced to watch it several times. This is genius of course but that aside, this confected cacophonic jingoistic man meat has all the real entertainment value of a Vegetarian Sunday lunchwith no wine. NASA gets a lot of free advertising in this one but they'd have come off better if they'd released the Challenger Disaster looped, into cinemas.You can gain some fun from Armageddon though  play the drinking game. Take a shot of something really disgusting every time God is mentioned. You'll be dead about half an hour before the end, meaning you'll miss the climatic funeral scene AND the infamous ""he's got space dementia!"" line.

Multiple Bogeys!,"Armageddon (1998) -Wow! Why did I do that to myself again? Even at the age of 18 when I first saw this film at the cinema I thought that the idea of sending oil riggers to save the planet was a stretch and really quite ridiculous and now upon watching it for only the second time, I can safely say that the best thing about this one was the Aerosmith soundtrack and the main song in particular. Sadly though, I did want to miss the whole thing.Within minutes I remembered how much of a cringe it was to watch this insane farce unfold. I'd actually forgotten how busy it was all the time, because all of the nonsense just didn't stop for the first half an hour at least. There was a lot of shouting and running around and even shooting and the majority of these things were absolutely unnecessary. I might have had more respect for them as a potentially planet saving group if they weren't clearly all such dysfunctional personalities. People that probably all has anti social behaviour bands on their ankles and who wouldn't even be allowed to look at a NASA spaceship.I wouldn't trust one of them to do that job for me and would have sacked them all within the first hour after meeting them. I wrote just the word 'Farcical' in my notes at some point and I couldn't say why and at which time in the film that I was referring to, because it was all so bad.In fact I found it far more believable that 'Howard Wollowitz' from 'The Big Bang Theory' (2007-19) was sent to space than I would ever believe that this mob could be employed to even consult on the mission.Even the action was too shaky on camera and all over the place to enjoy and overall it was way too long.I normally love Bruce Willis and can't stand Billy Bob Thornton, but I have to say that Billy was the better character here and he delivered it better too.The story might have worked better and been more believable if it had been set in a dystopian future and set in space from the start. Something more akin to 'Alien' (1979) or 'Event Horizon' (1997). That way a group of rogue lawbreakers with heart might have been a team that the viewer could get behind, because this whole concept was just too unlikely for a story set in the real world.There was a lot of unnecessary drama and the stupidity and extremes towards the end were absurd. It was trying too hard to be the next great action film by including fights, car chases, guns and stupidity. And my god what a cacophony it all made. A real assault on the senses at times.I will not be subjecting myself to this dire endurance of cinema ever again. Fool me once, shame on you.

"Fun in places, not that dated, try it...","I recently watched this movie again. It had been many years since I last saw it and the wife had never so thought we would revisit it together. Firstly, just try not to overthink it. Yes, the plot makes no sense really, yep, scientifically it is most definitely incorrect and the acting and scripts are not great. It will never be thought of as Oscar winning material. It is though Saturday night easy watching and quite enjoyable and still worth a watch. It has not really dated too much. The film in my opinion is about 45 mins too long. The first half is the most enjoyable as we see the global killer asteroid heading towards earth and we meet the crew who must stop it. Bruce Willis gives a normal Bruce performance, Steve Buscemi is great fun and has the most laughs. Ben Afflecks 'AJ' the supposed hero is actually really annoying. It all actually just gets a bit tiring and boring when they actually get up in space and meet the comet, a fatal flaw in what is primarily a space movie.

Suspend your disbelief - you have to,"Right before the turn of the millennium, all these apocalyptic Armageddon films (Deep Impact, End of Days, even South Park Movie anyone?) were hugely popular. Fascinated by the seemingly impending disaster of the Y2K phenomenon, we moviegoers flocked to the theaters like sheep to see these films, caught up in a monotony of ""End of the World"" scenarios. However, Armageddon somehow stood out compared with the others.Maybe it was the cast. The star filled cast of Willis, Thornton, Affleck, Tyler, Buscemi, and Wilson is a start, but the performances were actually quite good under the circumstances. Harry Stamper (Willis) is believable as a lifelong oil driller. Affleck, not so much, but in the defining role of his career (to that point), he did a good job. Though the scripting of his love for Stamper's daughter (Tyler) is cheesy at best, by the end of the movie there seems to be a real connection between the two. It's not by any means a masterful script, but then nor does it pretend to be. It's a special effects action romp on an imaginary asteroid hurtling towards the earth at (literally) breakneck speed. Forget how corny it seems that the setbacks keep occurring one after another. Forget the mistakes with the actual physics of space - ""Fire in space? How?...There's no air!"" as well as a scene where someone tosses a pipe in the air and it actually comes down (""This asteroid is so big it has its own gravitational pull?"") - Forget all that. If you analyze anything here, it won't work. But then if you analyze the Ninja Turtles, Spider Man, or the X-men, they won't work either. While Armageddon will undoubtedly fall short of the ranks occupied by those comic book/video game (and now film) deities, that doesn't mean it can't be enjoyed, even by those of us who do have, and like to use, our brains. Just sit down, grab some popcorn, suspend your disbelief, and watch the movie. And when it's over, don't discuss it except to give praise to the actors where it is due, talk about the cool effects, or mention the awesome Aerosmith song ""I Don't Wanna Miss a Thing.""

"""Armageddon?"" More Like ArmaGAINING Critics' Approval","If you're looking for an action-packed, emotionally powerful movie that grasps your attention in an instant, Armageddon is the movie for you. This movie exceeded my expectations in nearly every way, through its enriching plot and acting, exceptional directing by Michael Bay, and its core concept of the power of relationships.The movie opens up with action right away, with a meteor shower. It first impacts a space shuttle, and then hits Earth in various locations, causing chaos and fear in people's eyes, as they don't know what is going to happen next. This scene catches people's attention, and is a powerful opening to what the rest of the film has in store. NASA then discovers a Texas-sized asteroid approaching Earth and they have 18 days until it hits. This causes panic in the space station, and everyone bands together to try to find a solution to this massive problem. It's a race against the clock to stop the asteroid before it's too late. They came to the solution of blowing up the asteroid from the inside, with the help of some oil drillers.Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis), an experienced deep sea driller is hired by NASA to essentially save the planet. No pressure, right? He agrees to the task, but insists he brings his own men with him, as it makes him feel more comfortable. One of his men, A.J. (Ben Affleck), is dating his daughter, Grace (Liv Tyler), and this is hard for Stamper to handle, as he is the typical overprotective father. Grace has been travelling with her dad throughout her life, as her mother left the picture. She created a family with the guys onboard, and they treat her as they would their own child. They have a strong bond that no one could take away. Bruce Willis' performance was superb as he portrays a character that is tough, yet vulnerable as he cares about his daughter. He also offers a sarcastic charisma, which helps ease the tension of their life-threatening circumstances. While Bruce Willis' impressive acting is evident in other well known movies like Die Hard and Sixth Sense, where he plays strong characters, he brings a unique depth to the character of Harry Stamper specifically. His powerful performance adds a lot to both the story and the film as a whole.One of the elements that made this movie so powerful was the use of music to create certain moods. Music had the power to increase the intensity of a moment or a scene and evoke emotion from the viewer. This film uses the powerful song, ""I Don't Want to Miss a Thing"" by Aerosmith multiple times. This song helped create a deeper emotional connection to the characters and the relationships that they formed. Michael Bay also implemented strong visual effects to portray space, and action scenes involving explosions. This was crucial to the film, because it made it more authentic and helped create a realistic portrayal of events. Some think that certain scenes seem impractical, as their bomb wouldn't be able to blow up an asteroid of that size. I recognize these complaints, but little details like these don't make or break the movie, as it is a fictional film.A core theme of the film is the power of relationships in one's life. Relationships add to the depth and the power of this film. Harry has a special bond with his men, as he spends nearly everyday working with them. Harry is extremely tough on the outside, and hardly shows how much he cares, but it's there. And he of course has the relationship with his daughter, who is the light of his life, and does anything to make her happy. Grace, in particular was the main reason that he decided to complete this task, in all efforts to make her proud.This movie is a must see, and thoroughly impressed me on all levels: plot, acting, visual effects, and emotional appeal. It also captured the core theme of the importance of well-developed relationships. It grasped my attention from start to end, and never failed to keep me on the edge of my seat. Michael Bay's fantastic directing made this film an entertaining masterpiece, and I recommend it to anyone seeking an action-packed, heartfelt experience.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"An entertaining movie, what it was meant to be...","Of course i've heard all the input as far as this movie goes. Oh it was so bad, it was unrealistic, no real plot, too over the top. Well so what! Bruckheimer and Bay set out to do exactly what they meant to do. That was to make an entertaining, explosive, summer adventure. That's right a popcorn movie. That's exactly what I expect from this duo, and nothing less than that. Not unless it was meant to on their part, other than that I look forward to these kind of pictures (The Rock, Con Air, Pearl Harbor). This is just meant to take us out of our own reality for a moment(2+ hours), and let us enjoy an entertaining piece of work. So what, it's not going to win best picture at The Academy Awards. Do you really think Bay didn't know that when he set out on this project. Of course he did, but the thing I like about his filmmaking is that you can tell that he has a lot of fun doing what he loves doing. And I say keep on trucking. Not a summer goes by that i'm not looking forward to some Bruckheimer, or Michael Bay production. Bring on the explosions...",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What a gigantic crock!  Er...rock...,"In terms of value for budget dollars spent, ""Armageddon"" is the worst movie ever made.  The movie has nothing to say about anything; it is purely an exercise in eye candy.  It is a piece of product without feeling plugged into the machine of feature film distribution.  It is cold and cynical, believing that all the audience wants to see is physics.  Judging from the box office, maybe the powers-that-be that green-lighted this project were right. But what about the movie?  The acting ranges from passable (Willis) to gut-wrenchingly awful (Affleck).  A mannequin named Liv Tyler plays The Beautiful Girl with all the verve and passion of a piece of shrubbery. The story goes that this movie was green-lighted and put into pre-production without even a script; it would be hard to argue after viewing the results.  There are many great screenwriters out there that can't get work, and then here comes this barely-even-written film to add insult to injury.  I had heard that living legend Robert Towne (Academy Award winner for ""Chinatown"") ghost wrote dialogue for a scene or two in this film; imagine how the movie would have been if he had been hired to actually write the SCRIPT instead of just doctoring dialogue.      The movie plays with all the depth of a Levi's or Pepsi ad; it looks like a music video for the movie ""Armageddon"".  Only on a purely visual level does ""Armageddon"" work at all, and even then it is heavy-handed and obvious, with shots screaming out ""look how cool this is!"", subtle as a sledgehammer. Michael Bay, Jerry Bruckheimer and their ilk have perpetrated yet another abomination on the cinema; as if ""The Rock"", ""Con Air"", etc...weren't bad enough, now we have this piece of space debris.  At least product like this keeps the studios going so that worthwhile movies can be still be made.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

My #1 Most Despised Film of All Time,"I absolutely hate Armageddon with every fiber of my being. This is probably not the worst movie ever made, but when considering the budget, the number of big stars, and the shameless over-promotion it is dollar-for-dollar the most despicable.The action is way over the top, it is wholly unrealistic, the characters are not at all interesting, even the special effects can only be marked as sub-par (especially when considering the budget of this film). It's just one lame gag after another. ""Oh my God, I dropped a screw! The entire mission is doomed"" over and over and over again until you find yourself wishing the mission would indeed end in a spectacular fireball just to put the film out of it's own misery!Unlike it's counterpart Deep Impact, these filmmakers don't even bother to showcase the human element of this story, how the potential end of the world effects society or even the characters involved. It's all about the father who feels like a failure; the girl who pines for her loser boyfriend; and the various psychotic episodes of the rest of the characters. Never do we even get the sense that these people care that the world is about to end. It's this lack of caring about humanity that boils out of the screen: the filmmakers didn't even like their audience. This isn't even a case of a good screenplay idea poorly executed (like Deep Impact), but the writers and filmmakers simply didn't bother to make a good film.This film will always sit at the top of my Most Hated List.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Not Bruce Wills worst effort ever (but a close second),"Yes this will turn into a bit of a rant because I can't stand this stinker. But Bruce has actually lent his name to even worse dung in the past with 'Hudson Hawk', but there at least it's possible to laugh at the sheer horror of it all, but Armageddon is so offensive in it's stereotypes that I can't stand to watch.It's been said in other reviews that this is a movie for Independence Day fans and I agree as long as they are prepared for even worse stereotypes and no characters that are lovable. ID has Will Smith & Jeff Goldblum in nice quirky roles with some humanity, but Armageddon has no character depth at all and the 'humour' never gets above the potty level.If either Billy Bob Thornton, Steve Buscemi or Peter Stormare are proud of this then I would be astonished. I even expect better from Michael Bay: the director of such junk as Pearl Harbour & Bad Boys. Why? Well he has done the flawed but OK 'The Island' & the stereotypical but entertaining 'The Rock'.Many modern action flicks are flawed in their portrayals of countries & cultures but stereotypes about Germans & South Africans aside 'Die Hard' & 'Lethal Weapon (2)' still manage to outweigh this with their charm, wit & pace. Armageddon does not.For apocalypse movies see: 'Deep Impact' or even the better than it's rated 'Twister'. If you want action you can pretty much chose anything & it will be better - why not revisit 'The Rock' by Michael Bay. Comedy: Even a Greek tragedy has more humor than this so you can pick anything & it will be better.I've rated about 250 movies on IMDb and my average score is 6.6. This is the only movie I've given a 1 (no I haven't rated 'Hudson Hawk' yet). When I give a score below 3 it has to be a truly bad movie - and this is just about the worst I've seen. If you are like me watch all sci-fi, then by all means live through it, but otherwise avoid it at all cost.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The idea of it is what matters!,"I've read some of the other comments about this movie, and as with other movies that have been released many people have missed the point.  It doesn't matter whether the movie is scientifically correct, or ""entertaining"" for you.  The point of this movie is to GIVE PEOPLE SOMETHING TO LOOK FOR IN THEMSELVES.  All of them had some sort of problem, be it physical, psychological, or social, they all managed to find the part of themselves that was able to work together in harsh conditions and save the world.  The group of people that went up into space to do this mission was the most misfit group of people that basically could be found.  However, in the end, even the two people (A.J. and Harry) that really didn't get along managed to work together and save the world.  So what if it happened to be U.S. astronauts?, so what if the asteroid was the wrong size?, look at the basic point in the movie and judge it for that, not how accurate it is!!! Oh, and just for a little clarification, there can be a fire in space. Think about it, there has to be oxygen on the shuttle, right?, so that's where the combustion fuel is from.

There were great performances all around the cast.

Buscemi and Stormare are a lot better than the rest. The space-flying scenes with everything happening in Tom & Jerry-tempo destroys all the credibility of the fantastic impact scenes in the beginning. Everyone have seen real space-flight on TV and knows that docking in mid-space isn't done in the same manor as parking in front of the mall.

Not sure who gets the prize for the worst actor. Either Bruce Willis for his conceit and smugness or the actress playing his daughter who is a total annoyance throughout. Indeed every actor and actress in the picture is exceedingly irritating. The film makers may think there is something funny about low life people being astronauts, but count me out on that one.Seems to me a lot of money wasted on some half decent special effects; its a pity nobody bothered to make anything else in the film worthwhile as most of the movie is pathetically poor, hence:2/10",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The way an action movie works,"This is great fun escapist entertainment. What really makes it work, and what most professional critics don't seem to get, is the way the movie shows the events and situations without the characters sounding like they're self-consciously trying to deliver textbook dramatic theory. The credit should really go to the various performers for managing to make their characters **chat**!!!Particularly notable is the performances of Steve Buscemi as ""So what, are we getting hazard pay for this?"" Rockhound and Peter Stomare as the whacked-out cosmonaut. They are examples of giving a story personality, and not just playing by the book. Of course Bruce Willis and Billy Bob Thornton as the leads also give their characters real punch and panache too. This is especially evident with the negotiation scene. ""None of them want to pay taxes again ... ever."" Sure, it's escapist fantasy, but the dialog and personality makes it come alive.Even Ben Affleck's gun-ho young heart-throb character is delivered with personality - including the widely-criticised animal cracker scene. It's important to remember that Affleck's character AJ is NOT meant to be a professional impersonator. He's just a deep-sea oil rigger who's casually goofing around with his girl. I think Affleck hits the characterization perfectly. (It certainly plays a lot better, with more personality and humor, than the equivalent heavy-handed sobbing melodrama of the bus-leaving scene in DEEP IMPACT!)Other scenes that shows why this film worked with the general public, and outstripped its competition are the casino and examination scenes. They give insights into the idiosyncrasies and traits of the individual characters, without them sounding as though they're reading their own character descriptions.Sure, this isn't going to qualify any viewer for rocket science, or help make the world a better place to live; but as professional escapist fictional mass entertainment, this really kicks some butt.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Well the special effects were okay, but everything else is so offensively bad that the chance of the effects saving this movie is about as plausible as the plot.I'm sorry but Michael Bay is the anti-christ of cinema. I would have rather watched ""Batman and Robin"" twice than sit through 30 minutes of this piece of junk.You know the scene in Clockwork Orange where they re-educate Alex with drugs, music and those ultra-violent visuals. Well this movie works just as well. I still feel ill thinking about it.It's like that annoying drunk guy at a bar who smells and is yelling bad jokes in your face. The one you would give anything for just for him to shut up, but you can't leave cause you want to see his butt thrown out of the bar, which is bound to happen at any point.This is cinema for the lowest common denominator.And of course you have morons defending it by saying it's not trying to be anything but entertainment; lighten up; this isn't a merchant ivory pic; it's just $8 worth of fun, etc.Great I'm all for simple mindless fun. But you still need plausibility and story and acting so you can believe. If you don't care about the characters then what is the use of showing me one of them sacrificing himself for another. If it had any of these things (even slightly), then it would of be fun.This movie is like some child telling you some improvised story with action figures: ""And then the Tonka truck guys go into space...and then they land on the ass-teroid...and then they drive around it and almost float away...and they have to put a bomb in a hole..wait wait I forgot the part about the drills...they have these big drills...and then the guy cries...and then the bomb goes booooooooosh.

"A propaganda movie i can't help but like!

It's a non stop action flick that puts a few A-listers and some best of the best B-listers in some very interesting situations happening in outer space.Directing and cinematography are music video like, as they always are in a Michael Bay movie, but music makes up for all of it. Aerosmith at it's best. Also, editing is quite good. The entire movie is well crafted and it's so hard not to like it weather you agree or disagree with some of the statements it presents. And writing, no matter how unoriginal it is, really takes the best from dumb science fiction movies and does a good job at putting it all together. Armaggedon is a big pile of overused Hollywood stuff, but the writer did a very good job with it and for that the movie is never boring or irritating in any way. And yeah, like i said, this is one of the biggest American Propaganda films of the last twenty years, but with all it's qualities i just can't help but love it. Even if those qualities are nowhere near to being original or fresh.As for the acting, the actors do quite good with their roles. Yes, even Ben Afleck. But the star of the film is still, as he is in any movie he's ever been in, Bruce Willis. He just looks natural in these bad guy with a heart of gold kind of roles.

"Great disappointment, horrendous movie.","I truly don't know where to start listing all the things that are wrong with this flick. I left the theater with a terrible headache, and feeling totally insulted. Does Michael Bay consider his target audience to be 12 year-old kids with attention deficit disorder? I find no other explanation for the long succession of flops that comprise this movie.The story is weak, the acting is plainly horrendous, the shameless flag-waving is embarrassing, and the many plot-holes make the script look like the surface of the Moon.I especially had a problem with the ""suspension-of-disbelief"" issue. I understand that when you go see an action film, you need to give some credit to the storyline in order to be able to enjoy it. For example, nobody knows how an alien looks like, or even if there are aliens at all, but we see ""ET"" and it does not bother us; this is so because the story is superbly told. Everyone knows that not everyone can survive a major explosion, but if the story makes sense and it's well told, we suspend our disbelief, give the creators some credit, and enjoy the show.In ""Armageddon"" the (poorly developed) characters are surviving excrutiating life-threatening situations every two or three minutes. They always scape in the very last second, and most of the time totally unharmed. How trite! Once or twice is fine, but not every three minutes through the entire movie. It's cartoonish, and does nothing but to kill the magic that makes us enjoy movies: suspension of disbelief. How many explosions can they outrun? How many shots or ridiculously unbelievable situations can they scape without harm? Pleeeeeease! Of course, this is a Michael Bay product, so any attempt to analyze it in a logical way is pointless.I certainly did not enjoy the radical conservative undertones through the movie (blatant bashing of Green Peace, only men take action while the women wait at home and catch the action on the TV screen, etc.), and the constant flag-waving to the point of ridiculous. I'm as patriotic as the next guy, but I don't appreciate flag-waving for the wrong reasons, and this movie has plenty of them! Other nationalities are reduced to plain caricatures of overused stereotypes (I felt like gagging every time they showed muslims praying in-masse, African children running in the jungle and pointing at the sky -like in a Microsoft commercial-, or every time the Russian astronaut from the Mir station opened his mouth -there's so many awful stereotypes one can take in a single movie!).

The only film I can think of that should come with an Ibuprofen and a watch with a purchase of the DVD,"I regard the quality of Michael Bay's Armageddon with great sorrow but regard its enormous box office revenue with an even greater amount of depression. Has the magic of cinema been reduced to utter mindlessness that is devoid of content, meaning, and substance? You could defend the film by saying it's a ""turn your brain off"" film, but what kind of compliment or defense is to that a film? That's like saying it's a requirement to be stupid before watching it in order to enjoy the picture simply on an entertainment level.Armageddon doesn't deserve that defense or any others. It's a terrible picture but in many ways does it embody everything that is wrong with American cinema as a whole. Racism, contrived emotions, overblown instances of peril, noisy, muddled sequences, hammy relationships, stupid characters, and patriotic, flag-waving nonsense thrown in for good measure. You look at a picture like this and wonder why we look like a slew of amateurs in terms of tonality and originality when compared with other world cinemas.The story concerns the fact that an asteroid the size of Texas is on its way to earth, and NASA scientist Dan Truman (Billy-Bob Thornton) has a plan to bury a nuclear device deep inside the asteroid that will break the asteroid into two separate chunks and miss earth. You'd need Bill O'Reilly, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, and a slew of other journalists and astrophysicists to explain that kind of certainty. Desperate to find those that could pull off an operation like this successfully, NASA contacts Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis), one of the best deep-sea oil driller in the world, for advice and assistance in staging the operation. Harry, however, has his own problems like keeping his adult-daughter Grace (Liv Tyler) away from her new boyfriend, who happens to be A.J. Frost (Ben Affleck), one of Harry's younger, more irresponsible drillers.Long-story short, he chooses to accept the mission and takes his crew of utter misfits along with him to assist him in these efforts. Among them is the overly-sensitive and sometimes violent Michael Clarke Duncan, the insane Steve Buscemi, the sophisticated prodigy Owen Wilson, the irresponsible A.J., and others. I don't care how desperate NASA would be in this certain time and I don't care how willing and confident Harry and his crew would be, nobody would send this crew into space under any given circumstance. The thought is truly baffling that the fate of the U.S. essentially rests in a man's crew who can't solve a simple problem without shouting or arguing.But leave logic at the door, since that's what we're supposed to do and look at the film's aesthetics, content, and quality. This is an incredibly boring picture, disgustingly overlong, horrendously underwritten and underdeveloped, and unspeakably redundant. By the umpteenth explosion around the fifty minutes mark, I was ready to wave the white flag. How loud does a popcorn movie have to be before we get the point? How screamingly obvious does every explosion need to be that it had the mass, density, and magnitude to level buildings, burn infrastructures, and send the camera spiraling into a dizzying frenzy? Michael Bay knows how to make every scene into a spectacle, which is why he has garnered praise and criticism. Some can appreciate it craft as a valuable addition into cinema. I see it as an emphasis on fast food filmmaking, or in other words, filmmaking that has the power to make us demand less story-wise but crave everything action-wise. I'd call these films dangerous to the public because it stops the desire and hunger for creativity and encourages settling on the bare fundamentals of film. In a culture already so easily amused by reality TV and sheer stupidity, it is films like Armageddon we need to uniformly ignore.And if it weren't the explosions being the driving-force the film's badness, it's the abundance of music and emotion to manipulate and tell you exactly how you're supposed to react and feel towards every setup in the film. Between the soundtrack of Aerosmith, Bon Jovi, and Journey giving us the exact feeling we're supposed to possess and the incidents that practically flash what mood we're supposed to feel on the screen, Armageddon offers no room even for audience reactions outside of the norm. If you ever wanted to watch a film and want to be in touch with the mood of the film so much so that you don't even want to process the information being shown to you than this is for you.Armageddon, despite featuring one-hundred and fifty minutes of sensory annihilation in the way of sound and visuals, is one of the most boring films I've seen in years. Inert, lackadaisical, overblown, and lacking in creativity and interpretation, it has gone on to be embraced only by those who could stomach such a degrading endeavor. This is the only film I can think of that should come with an Ibuprofen and a watch with a purchase of the DVD.Starring: Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Liv Tyler, Ben Affleck, Steve Buscemi, Michael Clarke Duncan, Will Patton, and Keith David.

This doesn't work on so many levels for so many reasons,"The most amazing similarity between this film and its sister blockbuster ""Deep Impact,"" is the same level of suckiness they register. This one, the hard-core action flick (as opposed to the spring's sentimental ""human"" one) dredges up just as many horrible lines and schmaltzy relationship scenes. Only it rushes them and leaves character development on the fly, which is fine in a film like this. But it had better make up for it in action. There's a lot of intense music, testosterone-fueled scream-offs, quick cuts, and a few explosions: all the earmarks of action. But no action. Not on the scale of worldwide destruction anyway.Like Deep Impact, much of the best destruction was shown in the trailer. A couple of scenes were saved for those willing to put out the price of admission (like the destruction of Paris), but these are few and far between. Here's the perfect opportunity to randomly cut to any point in the world and show its obliteration by any size meteor the creators deem necessary. What a fantastic image. That's what we're here for. It's only used a couple times.Our hunger for worldwide annihilation is expected to be satiated with excruciatingly long ""action"" scenes like a shuttle refueling gone awry. These scenes simply feel like budget buffers and unnecessarily stretch the film to an uncalled for 2 and a half hours.Any astronomers or physicists, hell anyone who passed 6th grade science, should be prepared to feel insulted by the ignorance the script expects you to have. Even if you know absolutely nothing about things like say, gravity, the holes in simple logic are distracting enough to keep you frustrated: Easy access machine guns mounted on the space shuttle's drill machines? (Even though a handgun is under top secret lock and key) There was tons of debris hindering their landing on the meteor; when they take off, because the run time is way too long, it's miraculously gone. At one moment everyone is rushing because there's only 7 minutes of radio contact left. Hours later, once the action sequence has passed, radio contact is fine. With that big of a budget, you'd think they could stick a PA or two on continuity.Speaking of radio contact, why is it that people in space suits can only hear the other people in space suits with whom they're specifically talking only when they're talking to them? Another annoying transmission snafu: there are only a few moments to drop dead time and Bruce Willis (in outer space) has an unimaginative two minute conversation with his daughter (an earthbound Liv Tyler). I guess the 30 second or so delay between transmission and receipt of each line was inconvenient to the story line. And hey, why was there a camera in his suit, but nobody else's?Of course the special effects are decent. They better be for that much money. Few of the applications are creative, these generally involved crashing meteors. The effects used on the surface of the big kahuna meteor are unconvincing and bland. Digital effects look so obvious now, they seem to have reached their limit in simply awing us by existing, now they need creativity and unusual application.Bay does try to infuse some style into the shoot. A few cool angles here and there, and generally nice shot composition. Unfortunately he goes AT&T/British Airways commercial in his montages of all the wholesome cultures around the world uniting in fear and prayer on the eve of Armageddon. At some points the dialogue and character plots are so bad, so pre-fab, one can't help but hope for a sign that this is all tongue-in-cheek. Please, just a pinch of irony. Is this how stupid we've become? Is ID4 really the masterpiece, formula-setting film this movie sets it up to be?The film starts out with some promise. The impromptu meteor shower on New York with a sprinkling of zany characters gives us the hope for a sarcastic, playful Armageddon. But the waterworks and lovey-dovey crap are heaped on soon thereafter. Armageddon may bring on the end of worldwide destruction movies.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
BAMMO!!!!!!!,"Wow, what an EXPLOSIVE movie.  This movie was everything I expected it to be: action packed and plot deprived.  There wasn't a very interesting plot to the movie, as it just tells the story about a bunch of oil drillers trying to save the world.  That's the basic plot in a nutshell, and it is quite far fetched if not utterly stupid.  Armageddon makes up for it's lack of plot with it's explosive special effects and action sequences.  This movie provides large doses of suspense and adrenaline leaving the audience breathless or dizzy.  Some of the scenes happen so fast that it's hard to tell what's going on, and vomiting seems like an inevitability.  If action is your thing, and you really want to see things get blown to hell, this movie is your thing.  You will see New York get pummeled by a barrage of meteorites, and beautiful Paris disintegrate before your eyes.  However, if you're looking for a movie with a decent plot and some interesting characters, look elsewhere.  You'll just sit through the movie wishing you brought aspirin.

The Mountain of Assembly,"The summer of 1998 was mostly unremarkable, with the majority of films failing to impress. The overblown Godzilla was a humongous letdown, as was Armageddon's rival Deep Impact. Armageddon came out champ of the summer season (along with Saving Private Ryan, Lethal Weapon 4, and There's Something About Mary). But none of these films managed to push past $217 million, which would be absolutely unthinkable now, inflation or not.Despite the relatively low box office returns (just a smidgen over $200 million), the marketing machine for Armageddon was in our faces everywhere, and I feared it might burn-out audiences before release. I know I felt a little cynical when I went into the cinema that day, my expectations very low.I've said before that Michael Bay does himself no favors. The man knows how to make a blockbuster, but he's utterly clueless when it comes to making a good film. Armageddon is the only film in his entire resume that I find watchable and entertaining, though he still should have held back some scenes (the notorious animal cracker love scene really should have been dropped).A big boulder of iron ferite hurtles through space, knocking smaller meteors toward Earth (thinking of breaking a frame on a pool table). NASA recruits immature oil driller Harry Tasker and his band of roughnecks to go into space and nuke the comet before it ends all life our little blue planet. With an 18-day countdown it's going to be very, very close.Although it took a total of 18 writers to staple the screenplay together, Armageddon succeeds in almost every area where Deep Impact failed, plus more. The soap opera is kept to a minimum while the action is ramped up, delivering one hair's-breadth escape after another, all to the sound of Trevor Rabin's amazing score, which the life blood of the movie. The huge cast of fine actors, the SFX, and the action would all be significantly inferior without Rabin's soaring tunes, which turn many of the key scenes into wordless music videos of visual storytelling.That's not to say that the acting isn't notable. As a matter of fact, Bruce Willis is surprisingly effective, as is Will Patton, who rarely gets a decent role in mainstream movies. Though, as with Con Air a year before, Steve Buscemi owns every scene he's in (tying with Peter Stormare). Just ignore the horribly miscast Ben Affleck whenever he appears. He's the only real weak link of the movie, to the point where you ought to switch off during his screen-time.As the only truly exciting blockbuster of the 1998 summer season, Armageddon defines a lackluster year, and elevates Michael Bay's classless resume. It's exciting, colorful entertainment, and none-the-worse for it.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Relentless idiocy,"As the first bits of meteoric debris begin to fall on New York, the WTC is still standing, one of the ""bogies"" presciently hits the north tower, a bit lower that the plane did on 9/11, and a later shot shows the peak of the south tower on fire. The ensuing mayhem throughout New York is exquisitely Michael Bay, and what would the multiplex empire be without him? Thanks to screenwriters Hensleigh and Abrams, the entire movie is a witty roller-coaster of shallow nonsense, but who cares. Notably, Bay's heritage is Jewish-Russian (a reminder that ""American"" actually means ""immigrant""), and so the ironies come thick and fast: Hollywood pays his bills but in 1998 Bay was already powerful enough to risk piss-taking, including the touted American values of endurance, valour, national security, amid a stream of acronyms (DC, CIA, FBI, NASA) that lend gravitas to the enterprise. The classic countdowns and tension build-up are handled with a nod to Tim Burton's sacrilegious Mars Attacks in its rampant silliness. Not to mention the round-up of the motley crew to solve the greatest danger to the planet since the event of dinosaur extinction. For the first hour the script is relentlessly hilarious, but whenever the narrative gets semi-serious, it loses some of its mojo. This is also Bay's homage to Americana, larding on every imaginable trope of the US's idea of itself, not least the buddy-buddy macho teamwork. Yes it is crass and formulaic, parading the threadbare ersatz US belief in its wafer-thin democracy, even cliché about the Orient and Europe, yet the result is absurdly heart-warming, despite the distillation of America-first saviour mission not just of the world but of the universe itself. Throw in the docking with a ""clunky"" Russian space-station, and the parody becomes so blatant that it probably eluded most of the multiplex audience, who instead likely saw it as a eulogy to superior American scientific know-how and came out of the theatre feeling smug and rewarded. Midway through the film Bay deftly compensates for the quieter moments with even more wild pyrotechnics. Sure, it drags here and there, but everything points toward the fabled heroics of self-sacrifice, which is widely held to be in the American DNA, even by naturalised migrants. Throw in a festering love equation with an utterly static female (Liv Tyler) and we have the perfect Hollywood formula. Scenes of India, Turkey, Africa, China, a standing ovation for the USA's success of the mission. Watch it again when you're feeling the brunt of human folly in your government's mismanagement of lockdowns and vaccines, evictions and terminated furlough, cronyism and rerouting of public funds. The film is so downright silly it defies classification, but might put your anxieties on hold for its rollicking two-hour+ duration. Bravo, bravissimo.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Great disaster film,"When an amature sky watcher notices a giant rock in space, he contacts NASA. It is discovered that the asteroid is on a direct collision course with Earth, and is large enough to snuff out life as we know it. A plan is hatched to send up a team of deep Earth drillers to lay in a nuclear device and split the asteroid before it gets too close, deflecting the two halves enough to miss us.Once again, for the slow people in the back, it is a disaster film. The science is going to be terrible. If you have not yet figured out that fact from this and any other disaster films, you never will. I feel that the people that watch these and then judge them based upon how bad the science is are the same people that go to a Star Trek movie with a book that gives a breakdown of the Enterprise and get upset when the movie ship and book ship differ. These are meant as fantasy and escapism devices, not science lessons.This is a good film, with a great cast and many amazing one liners.

Michael Bay's Visual Masterpiece,"""Armageddon"" is the work that you remember as a kind of creation from the past, that childhood life that was once a long time ago. The film was released in 1998, and its viewing happened just in adolescence. Then the picture was very impressive thanks to the excellent picture and the huge scope of pathos, which is so characteristic of the works of the famous American director Michael Bay. This adds an excellent story of saving the world, a beautiful melody that is still capable of getting goosebumps, and a voiceover that tells that 65 million years ago an asteroid destroyed the dinosaurs. This has happened before. This will happen now. Apocalyptic parting words and the beginning of the story.However, behind all this spectacular plot and vivid narration lies an interesting story in which the creators masterfully introduce the audience to a large group of people who have literally become a family, working for many years in oil production under the leadership of Harry Stamper. The main role was played by Bruce Willis. The actor is the core of this film, his hero becomes the central character of the whole story when a team of drillers is going to drill a deep hole in an asteroid approaching Earth. Other characters are successfully woven into the presented world. Everyone has their own difficult path behind them, their own charisma. The characters appear alive thanks to a well-written script and excellent acting.From a scientific point of view, the film makes little claim to realism, but that's why it is fiction, in order to present the most unprecedented stories to the audience. And Michael Bay makes his stories very cool, allowing viewers to immerse themselves in a chic visual series. He is a master at this, and ""Armageddon"" shows how atmospheric a picture can be together with an interesting plot. The story of the confrontation between the heroes of Affleck and Willis is not new. The father does not want to accept his daughter's choice. In his opinion, the young guy who was chosen by his daughter is not worthy of a girl. Hence the conflict starts. However, the subsequent events force each of the heroes to open up in a new way and thereby show themselves to be those who are ready to be human, put up with the choice of loved ones and, finally, risk their lives for those whom they were ready to almost kill recently.Michael Bay's film is an enviable project in terms of success. This is a typical popcorn summer blockbuster, which is designed to collect a large box office thanks to a sweeping action, a great picture, great sound and a famous cast. There are good jokes and touching scenes here. But there is a much deeper meaning behind this. The viewer will see an interesting story of the relationship between father and daughter, will be able to trace how each of the main characters will change, understand their loved ones and their choice. And in the end, by the end of the film, when the fate of humanity remains hanging in the balance, each of the characters makes his choice, so the recognition needed by his family, reconciles with everything that is happening.Michael Bay's work, even after almost 25 years, is remembered with warm words. This is a great movie with a strong story, good acting and great picture and sound. Yes. At the same time, the film consists of a lot of cliches in this genre, a lot of illogicalities and inconsistencies, a lot of unclear decisions of the characters, huge scientific mistakes. But when the story of the characters is shown so dramatically, then I, as a spectator, am ready to close my eyes to many shortcomings. After all, the magic of cinema necessarily prevails if the creators are real masters of their craft.10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

At Best A Bad Joke,"Where does one begin with this movie, except to say that it's very bad. Let's begin with some of the more obvious things. First, it's hard to believe that with all of today's available technology an asteroid large enough to destroy the world could be found only 18 days before it hits! But let's assume for a moment that it's true. NASA decides that the only way to stop this from happening is to send people with drilling experience to the asteroid to implant explosives to blow the thing up. Well, maybe, but then we have to take seriously the proposition that the only people in the world who could do this are the rather motley crew assembled. We then have to believe that in less than 18 days (they have to be assembled from all over the world and then they have to fly to the asteroid, which would surely take 2 or 3 days anyway) they can be trained first to deal with space flight and then to actually work on the surface of this asteroid (surely drilling on an asteroid is a little different than drilling on earth?) It kind of makes a mockery of the whole astronaut training program doesn't it? Completely over the top performances from everyone involved make this movie cartoonish. Complete with the requisite love story between Grace and A.J. (Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck) it's really a bad joke, although the last few minutes, which feature Harry's (Bruce Willis) eventual solution to the problem weren't bad. Still, no better than a 2.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
this movie just rocks,"its a complete assault on your senses.  It builds a head of steam early on and doesn't let up for 2 1/2 hours.  Plus Michael Bay knows how to make things look good on screen.  Its a funny, exciting testosterone fest.   All lot of critics panned this movie but they are pleasantly invited to caress certain parts of my anatomy with their tongue.  To me this critics have just forgot what its like to have fun and be entertained at the movies.  This is pure escapism at its finest.  In my opinon this was the second best movie of the year.

A new standard for bad movies,"I've noticed that I've been saying ""well, at least its not as bad as Armageddon"" a lot lately.  This is very possibly the worst movie ever made. Sure, you could argue that some of the MST3K type movies are bad, but you have to remember they were made on a shoe string budget and most a couple decades ago.  This is a multi-million dollar movie with big name actors. Not only that, but the scientific ""facts"" they expect us to believe are insulting.  Not that I can't suspend disbelief but this was pure laziness. Using accurate information/effects would not affect the plot (or the lack there of).  I could go on and on about what is wrong with this movie but the bottom line is there is just no excuse for the poor quality of this movie. I wish I could give it a zero.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
""" It Happen before, it will happen again. It's just a question of when ""","The praise for this film has not dwindled much since it's inception. The movie is perhaps one of the finest films of the past twenty years. The title is "" Armageddon "" which is synonymous with the end of the world. It's appropriate as this film purports to show what would happen if a gigantic size asteroid were to strike the earth. The story concerns the fate of the planet and what the earth's brightest men would do to save it. Concluding the best way to stop the rock in outer space, a brilliant research scientist Dr. Ronald Quincy (Jason Isaacs) devises a plan. The best drillers in the world are recruited to fly into outer space, land on the traveling asteroid, drill 800 feet into it's surface, plant a nuclear bomb and split it in half. The man requested is Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis) and he is told by Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton) the director of NASA that he has been selected to save the planet. Reluctantly, Stamper agrees but insists on taking his own crew which includes Ben Affleck, Will Patton, Steve Buscemi as Rockhound, Owen Wilson and Michael Clarke Duncan as 'Bear.' The special effects in the movie are incredible as is the top notch acting by Peter Stormare as Lev Andropov the Russian Cosmonaut and Keith David as General Kimsey. Overall, the film story is terrific and the major components are deeply emotional, exciting and superb. The result is a major achievement for the movie industry and a well deserved honor as a Classic. ****",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The Biggest Tear Jerker,"In my opinion, this was the better of the two ""end of the world"" movies that was released in 1998. The other movie I'm referring to is Deep Impact. Now while this movie was OK, the plot was definitely not as well done as Armageddon. You never really got to know those characters, and when the astronauts had to crash straight into the comet (which was nothing compared to the Texas-sized asteroid) i could've cared less. I didn't care if Elijah's character saved his wife, or if they all died. But in Armageddon you find yourself falling in love with all the diverse personalities of each character. Harry Stamper with his deep love for his daughter, A.J. Frost with his ""I'll do it my way"" attitude, Oscar Choi with his hilarious comments, Bear with his kindness, Rockhound with his obsession with women. Not to mention the wonderful cast of actors and actresses that played them: Bruce Willis, Liv Tyler, Ben Affleck, Michael Clark Duncan, Steve Buscemi, and of course the amazing talents of Owen Wilson! (if you haven't noticed, Oscar was my favorite character!) And at the end of this movie you find yourself bawling over the great losses, or at least i did.

Armageddon sucked--practically everything,"(1/1/2017 Update for corrections; written as is.)Armageddon is the complete waste of talent, time, money, and effort involved in the making of this utterly preposterous and sensational action movie.It's riddled with clichéd and idiotic plot concepts, lame acting, hokey love story B-plot, endless parodies of countless movies such as 2001, The Right Stuff, and The Abyss.The opening credit sequence was really crap, it's the same ""Genesis"" sequence in Star Trek II - The Wrath of Khan. The excessively edited movie looks like it was trimmed frantically by Edward Scissorhands stoned on cocaine laced with meth and crack.The obnoxious and loud soundtrack gave me a pounding headache. Some certain scenes in Armageddon looked like it was a commercial shoot. The U.S. flag-waving glory while dissing the third-world regions is very cynical and insulting. I won't even elaborate about the utter lack of scientific accuracies that caused the disbelief and totally insulted my intelligence.Overall, Armageddon is another stale and repetitive popcorn movie fare churned out from the BS Hollywood machine to make the quick bucks on purpose. IMDb has proved that there are the total of 9 writers who contributed to this P.O.S. movie, which is a total waste of the writing talents who sacrificed themselves for greed.The question is, will there be more like this? Possibly.Because the domestic audiences with short-attention span and the low I.Q. demands it. Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer should be shot for dumping this execrable and overtly sensational movie on us without warning. All they really care about is that they got us to shell out our hard-earned money, only to endure the excruciatingly bad movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Entertainment, plain and simple.","I know I'll receive some bad comments for this, but Armageddon is my 2nd favorite movie of all time. Just right behind Aliens. And why is that you ask? Because, for 2 and 1/2 hours, I was entertained. I thought Armageddon was funny, emotional, exciting, and inspirational, all rolled up in one big Texas-sized asteroid. I know the technical and factual errors throughout the film are more numerous than anything. But you know what? I don't care. I still thought it was a great film. Better than Deep Impact, and better than what the summer has had to offer so far. As far as the cliches go.....what movie doesn't have cliches? And now as far as the critics go....had this film been made by Miramax or some independent company, directed by Quentin Tarantino or some foreign guy nobody has heard of, shot for less money than what Titanic is still making every weekend, I'm sure the reviews would have been different.Bottom line, the end of the world has never been more fun.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not much to add that hasn't already been said.,"But since I'm here, why not?Two words come to mind: Noisy, Stupid.That's pretty much Armageddon.

This is an outer space version of those movies.Except noisier. And stupider.I did give this a 5/10 however and that's because I like action movies, outer space movies, tough guy movies and even noisy and stupid movies. Hence, the 5/10.This one is just particularly bad. The acting is good and how could you go wrong with this group?! Except Ben Affleck....who sucks.It's also the mind numbing (and now well documented) habit of Michael Bay to quick cut every 1.5 seconds. Headache inducing speeds.Again, it's not because I saw this recently and am comparing to movies that have improved on this cliched mess since.

As if specifically written for Mystery Science Theater 3000.,"When I go to the theater so see a movie, I am usually the epitome of theater etiquette.  I am quiet and thoughtful and considerate of the people around me.  This is consistantly true, with one exception...when I saw ""Armageddon"".  It was as if the producers and writers got together and said, ""hey, let's help out the people at Mystery Science Theater 3000 by making a big-budget version of the type of swill they usually watch.""  As I watched this movie in the theater, the smart-aleck comments rose from my vocal chords with such ease.  It was filled with such an unabashed ineptitude that I felt that I had to respond vocally.  Why was the movie so bad?  Oh, where to begin!  With so many elements to consider...the infamous ""animal cracker love scene""...the meteor growling, not expelling gas or exploding, but growling(!!!)as it passes the camera...the entire ""end of the world as light-hearted comedy"" mentality of the production...I just am inundated with compelling arguments for this to be considered one of the worst films of all time.  However, in defense of the movie, I've never enjoyed such a horrible movie this much.  The rhythm of the scenes is perfect for outside comments. In fact, I bought the movie specifically for the purpose of having parties to make fun of it.  When this element is added, the movie becomes quite delightful.

A Ton Of Fun! Even if it is no good.,"Armageddon is one of the most recognizable films in all of cinema, but not so much well liked. This is very divided, with very few people claiming the whole movie to be a masterpiece. I liked it. I didn't LOVE it, but you know.This is a blockbuster meant to make money. It is evident that millions of dollars were put into this, hence millions are needed for the movie to be any sort of success. Director, Michael Bay does his first and best super-explosive picture. Bay makes many high-powered explosions just for the heck of it. Starring in this is Bruce Willis along with Billy Bob Thornton, Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler and Steve Buscemi, all giving subpar performances with awful dialogue. Luckily, the negatives don't last...long.Armageddon is the twin of Deep Impact. Both are about humans preparing for a massive comet heading toward Earth that will cause extinction. While Deep Impact is more serious and accurate, Armageddon is mostly a mess of it. In nicer terms, this is the fun version. The first hour and some takes place on Earth with the preparation and subplots. Early meteors hit and Bruce Willis is angry that his daughter (Tyler) is seeing a handsome coworker (Affleck). There's huge explosions and violence just for fun. The acting is bad too. Everything (almost) is inaccurate and unrealistic. Deep Impact is far better. Even the background music and Aerosmith songs weren't enough to fully brighten up any scenes. But the take-off scene when they head into space is when the movie gains ground. The visual and sound effects are amazing and the set pieces are awesome too. Sadly, them being in space is way too long. Bay abuses his privilege.

All of course cloaked in director Michael Bay's gleeful insistence on blowing things up with devilish panache. Sure there are some twee moments, sure there is some less than great acting on show, but you know what? It's a disaster picture for Michael Bay's crying out loud sake.

"Action, Traction and Satisfaction within reason.","We didn't see this film in the theater.  They didn't show it in a surround sound room here, and that was a mistake. So, we waited to watch it on DVD, which was released on January 5, 1999.I've always enjoyed Bruce Willis in action films (i.g.Die Hard trilogy), and Ben Affleck has more than caught the attention of my 16-year-old daughter, and he impresses me as an actor with potential. But Bruce fell short of being as much a remembered oil rig expert as John Wayne was in ""Hellfighters"" (1968). And it was refreshing to see Ben Affleck's lines 1000% cleaner than in either ""Chasing Amy"" or ""Good Will Hunting.""Just as in the theatres, we decided to rent ""Deep Impact"" first, then see ""Armageddon.""  Two doomsday films released in the same summer.Although I really enjoyed ""Armageddon"", it was vastly predictable throughout the plot. Even foreshadowing was not subtle enough.  But the occasional verbal and visual references to classic movies (Dr. Strangelove and Pulp Fiction just to name two) tickled my movie buff receptors. And Steve Buscemi continues to be one of my favorite ""independent extras"" with his constant quips and sharp tongue.The story was thin, the emotions were stilted, but the action and effects were involving.  Definitely worth an evening in your home theatre, but not a flick full of content.  The only depth to this story was the 800 feet of rock they had to drill.Overall, this film gets an 8/10, mostly for the casting of the motley crew of oil drillers-turned-astronauts, and the action.  It is, afterall, only a movie.  Escapism, in my opinion, is still a movie's best attribute.

It's not confusion, the effect he describes is exactly why he was a good director!(Bay was misquoted about his critics on the movie: he referred to the ""editing of the third part"")As for the writing I'll say what I say about every writing: it's as good as it channels what the writers wanted to. And this writing does it's job. They didn't want a documentary, they didn't want to make a deep and thoughtful film... They wanted to entertain and ENTERTAINED I WAS!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Just downright awful.,"This has to be one of the worst films made in a long time.  Even by the standards of films of its genre it is awful.  It is unintentionally funny, but you laugh in embarrassment, not amusement.  The actors try their best, but they are outdone by a ludicrously bad script.  It is a technically proficient film but that is about all the good you can say about it.  I found myself in tears laughing at the risibly bad climax, having laughed until I ached throughout this pile of tosh.  Avoid like the plague.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Very entertaining,"Armageddon is one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen. If you are looking for a movie with character development, a good story line, good acting, realism and emotions you probably shouldn't watch this movie.The story is very simple: ""An asteroid the size of Texas is on collision course with Earth. In order to prevent this disaster from happening NASA sends in the best oil-driller on Earth Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis) and his team to drill an hole in the asteroid so they can blow him up from the inside."" It's obvious the movie isn't meant to be a serious one...it's clear the makers wanted purely to entertain the viewer and in that they didn't failed.Armageddon is a non-stop action movie with great special effects that doesn't get boring for a single second mainly because the pace of the movie is very high. Every single character is entertaining in it's own way and pure fun to watch, especially the Steve Buscemi character Rockhound is more then great.I highly recommend this movie to everyone that want to watch a great non-serious entertaining movie. Just sit back, relax and watch the movie.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I can't help it!!! I really enjoy this movie!!!,"Armageddon was the most hated movie by film critics for years. It was the second movie in 1998 about a huge asteroid tumbling towards earth. The other movie was Deep Impact. Considered to be the ""serious"" one of the two movies.There is not much story here. Harry Stamper, an expert oil driller is brought in by NASA to help them with a plan to destroy the asteroid before it hits earth. That's it. A cast of roughnecks as they are called go along with Harry into space to land on the asteroid to drill a hole big enough to get a nuclear bomb far enough to blow up the thing. Armageddon was directed by Michael Bay. And even though this was his 3rd directing gig it was the first of his movies that he showed the most of his directing and editing rapid fire style that he known for. Personally he has taken this to the limits especially in the Transformers movies. It is supposed to be adrenaline pumping action but at times it is so over the top that it is exhausting. Armageddon is like that. Big, loud and exhausting at times. But, it's fun. As much as I agree that this movie is as dumb as anything ever to hot the screen it is just fun. The cast includes Ben Affleck, Billy Bob Thorton, Liv Tyler, Owen Wilson and Steve Buscemi. Among other less known actors. You would say that this movie comes under the ""so bad it's good"" category. Maybe so.Grade: B",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

And then (jumping to the end of this jewel because I don't want to waste any more time with this review), the editing. EDITING? I don't know which was worse, the editing or the worthless script. That wasn't editing. There were so many jumps from one scene to another near the finale, that my head started spinning and I started laughing just so I wouldn't throw up from the over-assault of my visual senses and from the dizziness brought on. I hadn't felt that queasy since having sat through the Blair Witch Project with its incessant camera shaking. I laughed but not all the way to the bank as this sorry cast did. Fact is, this movie actually made me mad when I left the theatre. What a sorry, sorry mess. Yes, I was laughing mad. I would classify this as the best comedy ever and the worst serious movie ever and right on par with another very expensive worthless flick, the Wild Wild West. What absolutely amazes me is the amount of money this stupid travesty brought in. I look back and wonder why the hell there wasn't a class action lawsuit filed against the concocters of this comedic garbage. I have never asked a theatre for my money back.

I don't mind Willis (""Die Hard"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" are two of my all-time faves), but in this one he was so annoying I wished I could reach in the TV screen and punch him out, just like most of the other characters.""Armageddon"" is a testosterone-overloaded special-effect-laden mess, with a horrible screenplay and bad direction. The soundtrack is ok (I'm a big Aerosmith fan), and there were 2 characters who I didn't feel like shooting (Billy Bob Thornton and Liv Tyler's characters were close to normal).Also - I'm Canadian, and I hate these huge American movies (a la ""Independence Day"") that seem to tell the world, ""Without America, you'd all be toast!"" - and throw American flags in our faces while blowing up everything in sight.The thing that gets me is... Thornton won an Oscar in 1996 for writing the screenplay to ""Sling Blade"". Co-star Ben Affleck won an Oscar in 1997 for co-writing ""Good Will Hunting"".

'Space Dementia',"Possibly the silliest movie I've seen in a very, very long time, if not all time.A deliriously over-the-top explosion-fest, unfortunately it simultaneously manages to be really very dull, which is quite the feat. The problem isn't that it's predominantly an action movie, it's not the flexible approach to reality, it's not the preposterous plot, or the daft script, or the cheesy sentimentality. The real problem with this movie is that it's a bloody mess.Whilst individual shots are striking, like a comic book come to life, as a moving picture it quickly falls apart. The ludicrously fast-paced action and the chaotic shoutiness of it all are grating from very early on, and it doesn't get much better, so the thing just drags. There's no emotional connection whatsoever with any of the characters so you neither know nor care who's bought it, it's just another damn explosion to laugh at.Disappointing....",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"an epic arguably flawed by clichés and excessive sentimentality but I think it all fits together to be what it was meant to be; funny, sad, high-octane action","Does the movie feel like it's 2 and a half hours? Sure. But it covers a lot in that time. And it opens with a sheer kickoff, the first 10min is visually unforgettable. After that we get about 50min of exposition and character development, underlined by various emotions, primarily humor in light of the very grave subject matter. After which we get some speeches, sappy scenes and music - the Aerosmith theme of which I unashamedly love - preluding the big moment of venturing into space. Then the real fun begins, it's intense and loud and outrageous; it's very Michael Bay. Is it scientifically accurate? Not wholly. But that's the wonderment of a science FICTION movie. And as a big-budget sci-fi flick that utilizes primarily practical effects in the second half, not to mention under rushed production, it equates to fun, even if it is dumb fun, so I really can't complain. As a rewatch it can be a bit of a struggle in the first half without a remote at handy, but if you're able to skim through then you're bound to enjoy most of it. The characters are a riot, laudably led by Bruce Willis and, in my opinion, Will Patton. Though I know Affleck was the second lead, I have nothing against him but it's just a very generic role. Liv Tyler is too beautiful to comprehend, Michael Clarke Duncan, William Fichtner, Peter Stormare, and - oh, let's see, the whole cast - are excellent. I'll defend this movie against its shockingly low rating anyday. Flawed? Yeah, it's Bay. But c'mon - it delivers as intended.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Cool, action, sci-fi movie.","This movie would have a higher score if it weren't for very anal people who have to downgrade every movie that isn't an Oscar caliber picture.

This movie isn't meant to be serious, it is a nice fun movie where you can just relax and turn your brain off for a bit.  Not all movies have to be deep and make you think...in fact it takes a lot less time and energy to make all those great movies than it does for the summer blockbusters.  If I want to think hard and be challenged, I will read a book thank you very much, movies to me are an escape and should be an enjoyable experience.  This movie was that for me.  The story an asteroid is heading toward earth and the only way to stop it is to drill it and put a nuke in it.  Does this sound like award winning material...no, but it is fun to watch.  The cast is great and they seem to be having fun making this movie as well.  The only scene I could have done without is the animal cracker scene.  That was for the ladies, just like the special effects finale in Deep Impact was for the guys.

"Well, I love it","I could not count just how many times I have seen this film.  Twice in the cinema but several times since on video.  And it just gets better and better.  But let's not get all serious here.  It is not intended to be utterly realistic.  It is supposed to be a fun, fx movie with a plausible plot.  And indeed it is.  The characters are fun - Bruce taking on his usual role of the grumpy, world saving leader, Ben as the gung-ho jock with a soft spot for his employer's daughter, Liv as the daughter with a small but emotionally charged role and of course Steve as the genius idiot.  Although I was reduced to tears in various parts (seriously, I cried like a baby), this film makes me smile and gives me goosebumps beyond belief.  Although I believe it is time to give Brucey baby some new dialogue - (come on, what's with the ""Let's just ask God to take care of our friends"" and ""I have never missed a depth I have aimed for, and by God I'm not going to miss this.  I will make 800 feet, I swear to God I will"" - I thought his performance was first rate as a dad with a conscience.  Overall, I think it beats everything I have ever seen.  Good fun, great fx and good weepy emotion.  And Liv Tyler is amazing - with three heartwrenching scenes in the control room - ""That is my father up there"", ""I don't have anywhere else to go"" and ""That is my family up there so I don't wanna hear we hope so"".

It's so silly to see the cliche, the stereotypes (Ah! those Russians, you know?) the weak plot, the scientific absurdity, those big big Hollywood boom boom boom special effects, that nasty big big boom boom boom sonic sound, the primitive American patriotism.

"All in good fun, but not excellent.","Ever since this film and ""Deep Impact"" came out, I've been unsure as to which I liked better.  I've always been leaning towards Deep Impact, so the other day I watched ""Deep Impact"" and today I watched ""Armageddon"".  I have to say that on the whole, I liked Deep Impact much more.  But that doesn't mean that Armageddon isn't a good movie, in it's own right, Armageddon has some good things going for it.Armageddon is much ""flash-ier"" than Deep Impact and definitely more action-oriented.  You can tell that director Michael Bay went for the ""what looks coolest"" approach, which is fine with me, but sometimes he went a little too far.  Michael Bay also seems to like going for the ""absolute worst case scenario"" / ""get there just in time"" sort of situations.  As I said, Armageddon has some good things going for it.  The story is pretty good, the acting is quite good, there is a great deal of humor, a lot of great lines, and some superb special effects.  Also, this films plays the ""romance chip"" much more than Deep Impact does, so if it's romance you want, then this is the film for you.There are a bunch of superb actors in this film, including Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler, Will Patton, Steve Buscemi, William Fichtner, Owen Wilson, Michael Clarke Duncan, Peter Stormare, Jason Isaacs, Ken Hudson Campbell, and Keith David.  All of the cast did a fantastic job and I really liked their characters!  I thought they were all very unique and quite interesting to watch.  Their interactions were great to watch as well.All in all, I thought this was just a fun, action-packed, humorous, sci-fi story, with a touch of romance.  I wouldn't recommend this to everyone, but it should appeal to a wide variety of people.  Also, don't start watching this film expecting a completely realistic film, because this isn't.  It's just a fun story, with a lot of cool things to look at.  I would say that if you're torn between watching ""Armageddon"" or ""Deep Impact"" and don't plan on watching both films, then go with Deep Impact, but as I can see from the reviews on this site, it seems that everyone disagrees.  Some like Deep Impact more, some like Armageddon more, some (like me) like them both, and some hate them both.  So, I'm not really sure what to tell you.

But you have to turn off far more than usual to watch this film. You have to give up any sense of discovery, or ambiguity, because this film has neither. You have to turn off your brain entirely,  from the pacing, the limp plotlines, to the gut churning photography where a shot more than 10 seconds long that hasn't rotated, spun, zoomed or swept is a chance to let your stomach settle. The characters couldn't utter their lines less convincing ways, the supposedly great special effects were used to support such lousy science it was far more of an affront than in the old days when lousy effects went with lousy science. Every single scene looks like a cliche commercial from some product or another. Why do astronauts have to walk in slow motion? Why do they have to have an explosion of some kind every 10 minutes or less? From exploding oil wells, exploding cars, exploding space shuttles, exploding space stations, exploding astronauts, you get the idea.

Definitely the best comet movie of 1998!,"I have read a few other reviews of this movie, and I have seen the votes casted, and quite frankly, I cannot figure out what is wrong with this movie! It is perfectly directed (Michael Bay), with a great cast including Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thorton, Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler, and a host of others.While Deep Impact worked too much to have a feasible story to it, Armageddon went strictly for the ""AWW"" reaction.  This film is full of eye candy that will catch you from the opening sequence, and keep hold of you all the way to the final explosion.  While it's special effects were definitely fun to watch, the story lacked only in the dialogue.  Thinking that the audience didn't want to be overwhelmed with technical mumbo-jumbo, the writers chose to use ""baby"" terms easier for us to understand.  While this did infact slightly deminish the dialogue, the actors cast to portray the heros did an excellent job relaying the script. Steve Buscemi was great in the comedic role and Michael Clark Duncan was hilariously funny at times as a big, strong, muscle bound man, with a childish weak side to him. The beginning of this movie will have you sitting on the edge of your seat, and by the end, you will definitely have a tear in your eye just creeping down your cheek.

What would have been a more fantastic finish to this movie, just as AJ and Bruce's daughter were walking down the runway after the space shuttle had landed and received its heroic homecoming, would have been for Bruce's smoking space helmet to suddenly appear in the sky, and land on the tarmac and bounce a few times...........",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What a crock!,"""Deep Impact"" was bad enough, but compared to this it's a masterpiece of subtlety and artistry.  I like to be entertained at movies as much as the next guy, and I like action movies too.  But this bombastic, blow-hard insult to one's intelligence is sheer crud from its opening minutes on.  The script is complete drivel, and this is a classic example of piling on the special effects and noise and hoping no one notices how abysmal the writing is.  Bruce Willis has never been more obnoxious, and Liv Tyler gives the year's most insipid performance.  I'd like to give an award to anyone who can relate the plot of this film with any coherence while managing to keep a straight face!",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Leaving On a Jet Plane Lyrics - John DenverOnce again, the world is threatened by Armageddon. A dangerous, it is heading straight for Earth. Our only hope will be to send a team of roughneck drillers to dig a hole big enough to place a bomb and shatter the meteor.This movie is lots of fun on many levels. It is a parody of disaster movies; however, the characters don't know that they are a parody and play it straight. This allows us to have fun without having to listen to a bunch of campy over-the-top one-liners that don't match the movie. It's a father-daughter story, and of all things, the father would have to be Bruce Willis who brings his killer formula to the story and fits his part perfectly. The daughter played by Liv Tyler (before her The Lord of the Rings fame) adds a great catalyst to the story. The rest of the team is rounded off by contemporary actors for which you will recognize immediately.The graphics and action, both explosive and human, will hold you to the end.This movie is worth watching over again so you can see the nuances that were missed the first time through.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"i felt sorry for the rock, to be in a film like this","First of all to a question one commenter wrote, did Owen Wilson die in any other film? yes in the other crap film Anaconda. This is one of those films that Hollywood make for the American audience. They think they are stupid and they will watch any film full of stars and action, explosions and the like. Hollywood don't like their audience to think, and this film in the first twenty minutes proves it. The earth will be demolished in 18 days ( so far so good ), so NASA get Bruce Willis, ( best driller in the world ) to come and help. So, they come and pick up Willis and his daughter, ( played by Liv ) off a drilling platform in the ocean and take them to NASA headquarters. Willis comments on the fact that in 18 hours they have been apologizing to him for the inconvenience. So, lets say it took a couple of days to explain to them the situation, why oh why did the rest of the crew leave the platform?? And how the hell did the role of Ben Affleck, in a couple of days set up his own company and started drilling? If you also notice he has a board with his name printed, and its RUSTY for crying out loud, in a couple of days. Where was he drilling, under acid rain. This is only the start and it was enough for me. I didn't enjoy the film at all. Please Hollywood if you are going to spend all this money on a film, do the decent thing and treat us like adults who understand a little bit.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of the best movies of our time.,"I was extremely impressed with this movie from the first time I saw it. It's disappointing to see that there is only a 5.7 from the viewers.  This movie has all the elements that a movie should...Action, Comedy, Drama, Romance...It's one of the 2 movie's that I've cried over in a long time. They did a great job of casting, I couldn't imagine casting a better Harry, Rockhound, or AJ.  The song, ""Dont Wanna Miss a Thing"" was perfect for the plot of this movie.  This movie is definitely worth the cash to rent or buy it.  I strongly suggest seeing this movie if you haven't already.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I enjoyed it,"What is with all you people being so harsh on this movie? No, it did not have a long and complicated plot, and a lot of the scientific space stuff probably wasn't too realistic (although you'd probably have to be well read and educated in that field to truly judge; otherwise you are being ignorant) but it was an enjoyable movie. And the idea of an asteroid hitting Earth isn't as completely off base as some of you seem to think; if you were listening to the news this year, you'd know that an asteroid (the size of Texas, I should add) has been spotted and may possibly hit earth 30 years from now. Armageddon was not extremely deep and involved but it wasn't shallow either. It pulled at your emotions because you could actually put yourself in the character's place; not in the fact of going out to space, but in dealing with losing a loved one. For all you sour, bitter, ""Armageddon was crap, the acting was terrible, it had no plot,"" etc, just lighten up! Go see Grease 2 --> that'll really give you something to complain about.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
