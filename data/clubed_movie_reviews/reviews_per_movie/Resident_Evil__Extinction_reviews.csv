Post-Apocalyptic fun,"One thing that's for sure is that the ""evil"" of the title is becoming less and less ""residential."" This time around the nasty T-virus has spread all over the whole world and humanity is in grave danger. I guess that's where the ""extinction"" part comes in.Once again we find ourselves not too long after the previous film left off. Humanity is in shambles and ""Extinction"" plays itself like a post-apocalyptic thriller, no pun intended. Alice is evading the evil Umbrella Corporation who needs to conclude some experiments but they can only do it with her blood and clones don't work. While wandering the desert Alice finds out she has mental powers, meets a group of survivors, and happens to be tracked by Umbrella all within what must be one hour. I guess it's not her lucky day. The audience however, providing you're fans of stylized carnage, is in for a little treat. ""Extinction"" not only provides a more interesting plot than the previous film, it also provides much better action and special effects. These effects feature zombies (naturally) but also demonic crows and a nasty mutation at the end. The action scenes are nicely done with somewhat unpredictable approach to who gets munched and who doesn't so tension is there throughout.There are also many absurdities, but they can only be expected in a film like this. For instance, the film is set in a desolate world with supposedly little supplies yet the women look like they put on make up every morning and regularly get a manicure. The GOOD women that is. Alice meets some BAD people in the beginning and these people somehow haven't picked up any of those bathroom supplies and make up kits that are laying around. Those bad people are another thing, they appear in an early scene that demonstrates that Alice can fight and kick ass... seeing that this is the third movie in the series do they really need to make this point again? If they avoided it, then the climatic fight might have been longer and a bit more, you know, climatic. But I guess that wasn't the point of that fight since right after it we are set up for Resident Evil 4.""Extinction"" is enjoyable for what it is, but that's it. --- 6/10Rated R for violence/gore and horror.

Third spectacular and stirring installment of the ¨Resident Evil trilogy¨,"The deadly virus has decimated the world, exception a little zone in Alaska where live people no-infected . Years later , one time Racoon was destroyed , the Umbrella corporation led by ambitious Dr. Isaacs(Iain Glen) continues his weird experiments with the deadly T-virus. But the Zombies spread the epidemic and those exposed to cruel bite suffer a complete transformation turning into meat-eating sickos. Alice(Milla Jovovich)is attempting to survive , and she finds new survivors(Ali Larter, Ashanti along with Oded Fehr and Mike Epps who repeat characters) traveling throughout Nevada desert . They must confront carnivorous crows, hordes of zombies starving of human flesh and an evil corporation chief who creates the most horrifying creatures ever made .The survivor group are surrounded , facing the world destruction by deadly epidemic.This exciting picture contains thrills, chills, action-filled with fierce combats and lots of gore and guts.The horror and action moments are fast moving and compactly realized. The film turns out to be a crossover between 'the nuclear apocalypse of Mad Max 2', the 'George A Romero's Zombies' and genetic experiments from 'Sigourney Wever-Ripley in Alien saga '. Of course, the film takes ideas from former parts as 'Resident evil'(2002, Paul W. Anderson, here also producer and screenwriter) and 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse'(2004,Alexander Witt)resulting to be a nice following. The creepy images of wide range from the genuinely fantastic to the bizarre along with an eerie and amazing frames. It's predictable but we have seen the previous chapters but also its predictability is redeemed in part by the charismatic acting from the action-women, Milla Jovovich and Ali Larter. The flesh-eating mutants appearance deliver the goods, plenty of screams, shocks and tension. The make-up assistants create a truly horrible zombie cannibals. Horrifying and astonishing images about apocalyptic events with deserted and destroyed cities, such as the creepy scenarios in Las Vegas without people, totally uninhabited and covered of sand. Cool,luminous cinematography using steadicam by David Johnson and haunting musical score by Charles Clouser.The motion picture is surprisingly directed with startling visual style by Russell Mulcahy(Razorback,Highlander, Resurrection).",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great Zombie film, Yes - Resident Evil film, No","While this RE3 was a cracking zombie movie, it strayed to far from the original concept and excepted storyline. In my opinion this has rendered the movie pointless in the RE franchise.Let's not forget that Resident Evil owes it popularity to the game series, so I think it's only right that they try and stick to it, even if it's just a little bit. It seems very much like the director wanted to make an updated version of Day of the Dead, if you've seen DOTD you'll see what I mean in the first 5 minutes of RE3.If this were a stand alone movie I would have given it 10/10, but it isn't, they've tried to be too creative and the director has tried to make a different movie. By doing this he's make a cracking zombie film. but a Resident Evil film, I think not.I only hope this isn't the last one, it would be a terrible waste.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Mad Max chapter of the RE franchise,"Directed by Russell Mulcahy of the criminally underseen awesome creature feature Razorback. I've always really loved this chapter. Maybe its because it has that epic Mad Max feel mixed with the telekinesis of Friday the 13th 7 and although it can be a little silly it takes the franchises back to it's scarier roots with homages to the birds and day of the dead. This time around Alice is still on the run from the Umbrella corporation and the world has become a desert wasteland. She stumbles upon some old friends and some newbies like a teen girl named Kmart, the singer Ashanti playing a nurse and a bad ass Ali Larter as Claire Redfield from the games. This one is the goriest of the first three and features some great old fashioned practical effects. The movie is fun, scary and action packed leading up to a bad ass finale and one hell of a cliffhanger.Budget: $45m

Mad Max with Zombies,"This is where the film series started really going downhill.Since the last movie the world has gone through an apocalypse with only a handful of survivors through out Earth. This is explained rather poorly in the dialogue at the beginning of the film.The Earth has become a wasteland and it's up to Alice again to continue the fight against Umbrella.Jill Valentine and the little girl from the second movie are now gone with no explanation, but we do meet up with Carlos again as well as meeting Claire Redfield who is a fan favourite from the video games.At this point I wouldn't even call the series horror anymore. Not that there was much horror to it in the first place. At least the first two movies had several horror elements in it. This does not. Cloning and experiements Yadda Yadda. A sci fi action film sums it up.The movie was ok. But just barely",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Nutshell Review: Resident Evil: Extinction,"With Extinction, the Resident Evil franchise perhaps have made its mark as the most enduring computer game turned movie to date. Most of such movies usually make for cheesy lazy weekend entertainment, little in depth but filled with plenty of set action pieces, which for the most parts are nothing groundbreaking. But what this franchise has to credit for its longevity, is Milla Jovovich.OK, so she has made mostly mediocre movies of late (I sense some fanboys will get me for this, but let me put it straight, I'm a fan of hers too), especially with the lacklustre Ultraviolet, and the really showy .45. If not best remembered for her role as Leeloo in Luc Besson's The Fifth Element (still credited in my books as the ONLY film I watched with having zero prior knowledge on anything about it), then it'll be for her role as Alice, the zombie butt kicking superbeing whose blood holds the key to a reversal of the effects of the T-virus engineered by the evil Umbrella Corporation.The premise here is similar to that of 28 Days/Weeks Later, where the virus is now out of control, and mutates humans into flesh chomping zombies, spreading mayhem worldwide. Human survivors are few and far between, and where we left off from Apocalypse, Alice is now travelling the world alone, seeking refuge and peace, while evading Umbrella's gunsights. It presumably takes place a significant amount of time after the predecessor, given that Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) doesn't return for this, keeping the doors open for either an unlikely spin off, or a revisit into the gap in timeline should Guillory sign on the dotted line.But I guess as Juvovich fans, we don't really care, do we? So long as we get to see our heroine in action, we're satisfied, whether she's causing misery to her opponents from her twin handguns, double Kukri knives or just her incredibly toned limbs, we're rooting for her all the way, dressed in garb personally designed by Juvovich herself, which provides for both form and functionality. The trend of casting pretty women to pair with her continues, with the first movie having Michelle Rodriguez, the second with Guillory, and now, Heroes' Ali Larter and Spencer Locke join the fray. However, they are relegated to more pedestrian roles as compared to previous partners, so don't be expecting much from them, especially for fans of Larter.The story can be no more simpler than Alice serving as a messiah for a small convoy of survivors headed by Larter's Claire, delivering them a message to journey to the promised land in Alaska. But of course the road to Peace and No Infection is plagued by challenges which culminates in a big battle in Las Vegas, where the trailers have teased with the entire city being semi-buried in sand. And like a video game, all levels will lead to their respective Big Boss to do battle with, and Extinction doesn't evade that formula too. Watching Alice grow in power, provides a lot of kick in some of the cool things she can do, enhanced with special effects of course.Don't expect the franchise to slam the door of opportunity shut on itself. By the look of things, we might even see a fourth movie coming up in perhaps two or three years time (the interval between the movies thus far). Expect plenty of blood and gore as our heroes cut through ugly zombies like hot knife through butter, and none other does it more balletic and graceful than Milla Juvovich. You go, girl!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
better than the first two by leaps and bounds,"i thought this was the best of the Resident Evil franchise.the action was more intense,the fight scenes were away more spectacular and i also really liked the music.obviously,it's not original,bearing many similarities to the first two.and it does borrow heavily from other movies.but still,it is an entertaining romp.i think it is much more gory and graphic than the first two.this is just an observation.it didn't really bother me.this is the first resident Evil movie i have seen on the big screen,and if you have a chance to watch it in the theatre,i think it's worth it.it won't win any awards for deep characterizations or storyline,but it really isn't that kind of movie.it knows what it is and doesn't try to be anything else.i think it does what it sets out to do,and that is to entertain.for me,Resident Evil:Extinction is a definite 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Despite looking so, this series is not extinct just yet.","I think Resident Evil: Extinction elevates itself slightly higher than its two predecessors and slightly higher than I thought it would in general. On one hand, it is a series of bizarre and somewhat illogical events that transpire under the scenario of an apocalyptic event's aftermath but on the other, it is a pastiche of 'zombie' films gone by; a crude study of one man's obsession with his research and a somewhat guilty action film. I liked Resident Evil: Extinction a little more than others of its type because it gives us more of a sedate look at the situation rather than a mere exploitation of special effects, attractive heroines and needless gore. Yes, it's true to say that this film has action scenes of a silly nature but they do not seem as stupid as previous Resident Evil films in which the protagonist is able to use kung-fu on dogs and make impossible shots to defeat her foes.The action scenes here are paced better and do not rely on the mere visualisation of actually seeing a Licker monster or Nemeses himself as the reason to keep watching. The enemies here are unspectacular and familiar and all the better for it; we get the feeling this is more of a survival film about the beasts and beings that would actually be out there rather than dumb scenes that try to impress us with a mentality: ""Look, a Licker."" or ""Look, this is what Nemeses would look like in reality."". In the film, there is a scene in which several zombies come charging out of a metal crate. The scene works on the level of realism within the film because the film could so easily have substituted them for a larger, more visually impressive enemy that would've sufficed for the following action scene.I mentioned the word 'realism' in that paragraph, perhaps crazily so. But Resident Evil: Extinction takes time to present its heroes, all of whom travel in a procession of large vehicles, with every day issues that would affect them. Things like 'how much fuel is left? Where is the nearest petrol station?'; 'Where is the next meal coming from?' and 'How can we bed down for the night safely and free from attack?' These sorts of questions were lost in the previous films and are empty from other recent post-apocalyptic horror/sci-fi films like Blade: Trinity. Additionally, when the film does reveal its particularly large scale monster for the film's climax it does so in an effective manner. This is because we have had the monster and the source for the monster presented to us on another plot line. We get a feeling that it may happen within the world of the film unlike when Nemeses popped up in the last film merely because he's had the injection and must now just keep destroying stuff until he meets the hero for the finale fight.Although it takes on the matter of the pacing and the clarity of the action scenes, Resident Evil: Extinction is still guilty of one or two things. The film actually begins in a manner than had me dreading it would be as bad as the previous two. Alice (Jovovich) meets some human survivors but discovers them oddly unfriendly which acts more of a surprise than a dramatic twist. It's a scene in which implied prior victims have been conned, raped and then fed to the dogs; in this case infected dogs and sure enough Alice finds herself in the said situation  a sequence of events that plays out in a daft manner that reminds you of the prior films. It had me thinking 'how do the renegade survivors lock the infected dogs up for next time once they've had their fun?' Then there was the rather careless scene in which Alice falls asleep in the middle of the desert, at night and with the fire still burning  not smart considering the situation. The film is also disappointing in the sense that when the procession of vehicles housing the characters Alice, they are spread evenly in ethnicity and attitude meaning each individual 'type' could be killed off accordingly.But for the best part, Resident Evil: Extinction is a surprisingly enjoyable film with an interesting set-up and I was really quite fond of the story running parallel involving Dr. Isaacs (Glen) and his research in developing the un-dead, albeit a clear reference to Dr. Logan in Day of the Dead. This plot line runs alongside the development of the convoy and the situations they must deal with, the thing I like here is that these people are not world savers; they will not go on a cause and effect fuelled story and make all the un-dead disappear, they are just there to survive and through Alice their goal is to make it to the icy regions of Alaska.The bizarre thing about this latest Resident Evil instalment is just how good it might've been had it cut the action scenes down a little and tidied up the opening twenty or so minutes. It is disappointing that the convoy is made up of a Redneck (who's naturally good at sniping); an Aussie; two African-Americans; a Mexican and a wise-talking white American, all of whom exist for zombie fodder at the end of the day but this film instils me with hope that perhaps the films can be as good as the games  in the games, ammunition was a very sacred thing and the tactic of running from enemies rather than shooting them was a good one. In the films, the producers are gradually realising this and the next film may well surprise a few people in terms of how watchable it actually is.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

A lot better then i expected!,"After the second movie i was ready for this one to be cheap and boring... But this film totally proved me wrong. It contains The plot and suspense the first film had and the action the second film had. Perfect combo!

The film was a pleasant surprise... though there was one setback, There wasn't much time for any info or background on important members of the convoy, all you know is they are there... Your not really given time to hear a little out each one and kind of get each one to have there own amount of screen time due to the lack of time the film was working with, I mean come on...

Deserving and Disturbing Sequel but NOT the Conclusion of a Trilogy,"We saw this at our local hometown theater, Movies on the Parkway in Sevierville, TN. I have to start this by saying that this installment is a bit reminiscent of George A. Romero's 1985 cult classic, ""Day of the Dead,"" in one major plot element. I won't give it away, but if you're a Romero fan, you'll see it for yourself when you view this film.This work is wholly entertaining, whether you are a fan of the games, or not. There are new elements, old friends, and a plethora of great innovations - some of which I've never seen present anywhere, and a few which were reminders of former masterpieces. I would name them, but to do that would spoil these innovations for those of you who have yet to experience them.The acting, direction, and quality were above par, while the style was more that of the action flick with horror elements. The predecessors were horror movies with great action. The suspense, the intrigue, the atmosphere were all horror-oriented. This time, the horror elements were minimized and the action reigned. This is not a bad thing, fans. Without some change like this, the franchise will suffer franchise sickness! As it stands, there is no danger of that happening.All in all? We were totally entertained, enjoyed our movie experience, and were blown away by the wrap-up. See it for yourself to understand what I mean.It rates an 8.9/10 from...the Fiend :.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
This was the downhill turning point for the franchise...,"Well, this third movie in the Paul W.S. Anderson movies, while being entertaining and watchable, marks the point where the franchise started to slope downhill.I will say that the 2007 movie ""Resident Evil: Extinction"" is still entertaining and watchable, sure, it is enjoyable, but it wasn't fully up there alongside with the 2002 ""Resident Evil"" and 2004 ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" movies.The storyline in ""Resident Evil: Extinction"" was good, but writer Paul W.S. Anderson opted to go for a grander and more epic scale, which just didn't really seem all that plausible. I mean, why would the entire world suddenly become a dried up husk and a wasteland? That just made absolutely no sense whatsoever. Sure, it was an interesting thing, but realistically it was just rubbish. And what happened to the girl Angela from the second movie?The 2007 third movie does have a good cast ensemble to portray the various roles and characters, and it was nice to have Milla Jovovich, Oded Fehr, Iain Glen and Mike Epps return to reprise their characters and roles. But the movie also had the likes of Ali Larter and Jason O'Mara on the cast list.Now, I will say that the special effects got upped quite a bit since 2004, and that worked well in favor of the movie. Especially the zombie make-up, prosthetics and effects. Now that was just eye-candy for a zombie fan such as myself. ""Resident Evil: Extinction"" also brought about the Tyrant, as you should be familiar with if you have played the older ""Resident Evil"" games.While ""Resident Evil: Extinction"" wasn't fully as good as the previous two movies, it was still an enjoyable movie. And hey, it is a zombie movie set in Capcom's ""Resident Evil"" universe after all.My rating of ""Resident Evil: Extinction"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Decent action no brains needed for plot,"It's a zombie slasher with minimal backround story. I guess the viewer is just expected to know the franchise by now.

Perfect Popcorn Movie,"Oh my goodness i haven't reviewed a movie in so long on here but after seeing Resident Evil: Extinction and knowing fanboys are gonna give it a bad score i was compelled to completely gush about how completely awesome this third installment was. To recap my opinion i thought the first film was really cool some little thrills, some neat special effects, but Alice was just so cool, i fall in love with bad@$$ heroines like that character with the exception of Halle Berry's Catwoman for obvious reasons lol. The second film only furthered my adrenaline rush with Milla doing all kinds of crazy stunts and that film felt closer to the games also made nemesis look amazing thank god they didn't use CGI. The third movie takes place in the Nevada desert.. well for the most part anyways Alice and a core few of the survivors unfortunately not including Jill *cries* are scrounging the world trying to survive and find food, gas, supplies etc without being eaten by the massive army of zombies that surrounds pretty much the whole world. Milla is amazing once again but this time she takes the reigns from Sigorney Weaver because this time Alice is no sex symbol she's an angry woman on a nonstop rampage not afraid to kill and think twice. The action in this movie is so amazing the change of directors really helped get away from the choppy hand to hand fights in Apocalypse plus this is the director of Highlander here mister Russel Mulchy is no stranger to great action films. There's a lot more scares in this one and a lot more gore and grizzly murder creating entertaining mayhem on the big screen. I love truly epic films like Alfred Hitchcocks work, The Departed, and Requiem For A Dream but i go to the theater to be massively entertained by more than just my bucket of popcorn and Resident Evil: Extinction keeps your eyes on the screen.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Directing, acting, special effects, plot, all came together into a well executed cinematic creation. I was glued to the screen and even jumping out of my seat as surprises awaited every turn. I found no dull moments as each scene was entertaining in its own way.

Nothing original here.,"Firstly, I was pretty sure what I was walking into with this film. At the worst, I expected a sub par action/zombie flick, and that's exactly what you get. Well, almost that good, but not quite.Spoilers ahead?This was a text book example of just how unoriginal the Hollywood horror genre has become. Not only that, this film actually flaunts that fact. It basically plunders most of George Romer's ""Day of the Dead"" (1985) for ideas, sets and story lines, and even finds time to rip an action sequence directly from the ""Dawn of the Dead"" (2004) remake. Fusing all that with the blatant ""Max Max"" approach does not make it original, fellas. Not content with those two obvious rips, the ""filmmakers"" do their worst to nip a bit from ""The Birds"" for a laughable sequence, nick their final monster design from ""From Beyond"" and ""The Swamp Thing"" and kill him off with a method right out of ""The Cube."" Have I missed anything? I'm sure the filmmakers would use the word ""homage"" to no end, but those who don't buy into the Hollywood copy machine would use the word ""insult"" instead.I only have two questions. A) Who green lights this crap? B) How much of the effects budget went to digitally smooth Milla's skin on all her close-ups (it looked ridiculous).Milla did a decent job and the costume design was nice, so a generous 3 out of 10 for me.",,Anonymous,Horror
"if you reeeely like the first two, see it ....otherwise meh","It was entertaining for the most part, very predictable, very cliché.

In fact, I think there's once scene taken word for word from it. (about their need to feed, and survival rate) Also, theirs a scene that rips of Romero's Day Of The Dead so badly, I was waiting for a zombie to say ""Hello Aunt Alicia."" and salute people.Anyways, it was mildly entertaining, I wasn't hoping for much more....I just didn't expect such blatant rip offs.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Right director for this installment!,"Of all movies made of video game franchises, Resident Evil is by it's own right a fairly entertaining series of films. The games have always been a standout amongst others, so why shouldn't the film adaptations.Extinction is by far the best of the three. Mulcahy was the right choice of director for this one. His atmospheric eye and fearless sense of close-ups take you for a 1 1/2 hour ride (that doesn't feel like you wasted your 8 bucks).The attention to detail and finally plot that that resolutes, not to mention the film's tight editing make this an entertaining ride.You finally care about why this event has happened, and most importantly you have characters who seem to care as well.Not a perfect film, but reasonably close.

So much better than Resident Evil Apocalypse!!,"The T-Virus has gone global, and the franchise is now a post-apocalyptic series. Thankfully, everything they did wrong in 'Resident Evil 2: Apocalypse' has been rectified in 'Resident Evil: Extinction'.Everything about this film is so much better than RE2: better characters, better acting, better photography, a much better and more defined plot. The suspense is back. The effective jump scares are back. The film once again has a good score and excellent visuals. Alice is now a full-on superhero, but here she was awesome and I loved it. Carlos (Oded Fehr) is back in a more prominent role, that as one of the film's heroes. L.J. (Mike Epps) - the annoying comic relief character from RE2 is back, as well, but this time in a more serious role with hardly any comic relief. (Wow, they really have learnt from their mistakes.)The pacing is really good and allows for lots of suspense. The action sequences are not as overblown as RE2, much more believable and better executed. The Crows scenes are fantastic, and my favorite scenes in the movie. This film was so good, it's hard to believe its the same writer as RE2 (and RE1, of course, but the first is still the best.)The main issue I had with the film, is the fact that characters turn to zombies almost instantly once bitten, yet some of the main characters last for hours or a day before turning. Why? Regardless, this is a fast-paced, thrilling, action-packed action adventure horror with bite!!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
predictable and dull with one redeeming factor,"Third entry in the series is a dreary, painfully derivative horror-thriller set in the midst of a cataclysmic T-virus pandemic that has plagued most of the known world. With no place to turn and no good options, a motley group of survivors must elude flesh-eating zombies as they make their way across the desolate west hoping to make a new start. Leaden script with a nonexistent plot is redeemed only partially by Jovovich who's unmatched as a scrappy, take-no-prisoners survivor, but beyond that it's just a senseless exercise in violence, special effects, and noise. A perfect addition to the undiscriminating/no-brainer genre. *½",,Anonymous,Horror
"Needs to be extinct, please.","My friend and I have been playing this game forever, and the game has brought us close and friends actually, so we are always stocked for a Resident Evil movie, even after ""Apocalypse"" twisted and messed up the game storyline, but this one ruined the game story at the end, which I'm not ruining.First off, Alice (Milla Jovovich) seems like dang Superwoman now, and that's crap. Her fight sequences are always awesome, but when she's shutdown, no undead attack her, which is odd and that's not all the minor errors in her character which made me mad.Big disappointment for a Resident Evil in ways I must say. Las Vegas isn't an option until halfway in the movie, when the trailer made it seem that's where the whole movie is. Many plot holes in some ways like what happened to characters like Jill, and when did they get gas (don't ask).The movie's not horrible, but certainly not the best.

I don't mind it if you at least throw in a one line monologue somewhere where she says ""I used to be a helicopter pilot."" But the average everyday person running from flesh eating deadites probably wouldn't know how to fly a helicopter.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Awesome!,"Complain about my score, I don't care. This movie was AWESOME!! It didn't exactly scare me, but it gave me the same feeling I got when I played RE1 for the first time. It was fast and the action barely stopped. It actually felt like survival horror.I thoroughly enjoyed Wesker's role in the movie. I was a little worried about how he would fit in. I know, I know, he did nothing but sit in a chair and talk. He did that in RE4, too. From the games I've played, I thought the producers had his character's attitude perfect. It seems to me they are making him the one who is responsible for everything that has been happening. Umbrella Chronicles for the Wii should cover that, though. As soon as I left the theater, I had the urge to go home play RE4.Which, in my opinion, is what a movie should do. Well, maybe not inspire you to play a game, but at least make you want to play the game that the movie is based on.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
entertaining but very average,"Is it good or bad things that always come in threes? It seems that in Hollywood these days, it doesn't really matter. So, after a decent zombie action movie and a terrible zombie/video game movie, we find ourselves with Resident Evil: Extinction.It picks up where 2 left off. The virus has spread, lots of people are mostly dead, and the remains of humanity find themselves travelling the open roads or holed up underground. Think Day of the Dead crossed with Mad Max, and you'll have an idea of the tone the movie's trying to set.The downfall of 2 was that it tried to be too much like the game, and 3 appears to have learnt from these mistakes. While there are lots of cute little nods to the source material, in the form of character names, little piano pieces, and claustrophobic corridors, the movie moves toward the standard zombie formula pretty quickly rather than going with the single character setup, although it does take a while for Milla to find another little gang of survivors and form our ragtag crew of zombie fodder; I guess the writers knew there really wasn't much material to work over in that respect.Meanwhile, there is the same sort of clichéd corporate menace from Umbrella, with their serums and their cloning (yes, cloning, in a zombie movie, obviously a great idea) and their plans to turn the zombies into a free workforce (another stellar plan). It's a subplot quite obviously lifted from Day of the Dead, but it just feels a bit redundant, although I suppose it does give you someone to boo and hiss at when they appear on screen. You know, as if the zombie hordes weren't menace enough. Having said that, some of the zombies look a bit...weak. I understand that there are fewer and fewer people milling about waiting to be eaten, but a lot of them just look thin and plastic, which isn't *really* all that menacing.Otherwise, Extinction features the same general ass-kickery from Milla, big action scenes, and mostly inept support from random stock characters. While Milla knows how to play this role, as do the other returning characters, but pretty much everybody else is just...bad. Check out the hospital scene near the start or the bit where that scientist guy ""domesticates"" a zombie for a host of examples of bad acting; these are definitely not thespians at the top of their game. Oh, and for more amateur points, don't forget that generic nu-metal soundtrack!While it isn't great, or even good, it's okay, providing a reasonable amount of silly cliché-ridden entertainment thanks to its unashamed lifting of material from every zombie movie ever and attempts to come up with new and exciting ideas (clones! zombie birds!), but really it adds nothing new, and will hopefully mark the end of a relatively unsuccessful franchise, despite its somewhat open ending.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Awe-inspiring zombie mayhem,"This is the third installment of the ""Resident Evil"" franchise and is easily the best entry so far. We are told at the beginning that the T-Virus has wiped out humanity almost completely, devastated the ecosystem, and reduced the Earth to a desolate wasteland. Milla Jovavich returns as Alice, whose blood contains the antivirus that can save what is left of mankind. She convinces a group of fellow refugees, who are aimlessly wandering in the Nevada desert, that they should all travel to a rumored disease-free refuge in Alaska. However, the evil Umbrella Corporation has been searching for her and has plans of it's own..This is a genuinely scary, gut-wrenching horror film from beginning to end. The central characters are placed in one terrifying situation after another and at times the tension is almost unbearable. Likewise, the action sequences are incredibly intense, particularly an early encounter between Alice and a pack of undead attack dogs (a series trademark).The film generates an atmosphere of fearful anticipation of the sort that is only found in the best horror movies. There is a decent amount of gore and Alice's skill with knives anchors some fantastic set-piece battle scenes between the survivors and the undead. A special mention ought to also be given to the strikingly imaginative set designs, a case in point being the depiction of a ruined Las Vegas.Where the film shows weakness is in it's liberal, perhaps far too liberal, referencing of earlier classics especially George Romero's ""Day of the Dead"", the ""Road Warrior"", and even Alfred Hitchcock's ""The Birds"". The film stays true to the mythology about the ""Resident Evil"" universe that was established in the preceding films and does not add too much that is really new.That having been said, in terms of generating pure exhilaration and intense fear ""Extinction"" takes the franchise to new levels and is easily one of the very best zombie movies in years. The next chapter in the series has a lot to live up to.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Mad Max meets The Birds,"Resident Evil: Extinction is the third of six entries in the live action series around former security officer Alice who fights her former employer known as Umbrella Corporation. She joins a group of survivors in Utah who plan on traveling to a safe haven in Alaska that hasn't been affected by the deadly T-Virus. However, the group gets caught in a deadly trap in Nevada and must fight against Umbrella Corporation's powerful administrators, security officers and soldiers.The film's biggest flaw is its beginning. While the transition between the first and the second movie was smooth, this movie takes place several months later and only explains rather vaguely what has happened in between. Some important characters of the predecessor have disappeared without any explanations while completely new characters show up without any introductions.Among the new characters, a tough but charming female teenager named K-mart played by a charismatic and quirky Spencer Locke steals the show. Another strong element are the dusty, isolated and hot locations that recall the Mad Max franchise. The film's highlight is when mutated crows attack the survivors which recalls animal horror masterpiece The Birds. The final showdown in Las Vegas is also highly entertaining and has a lot of symbolism as it shows how ephemeral this desert city of steel and class actually is.The plot is even thinner than in the previous movies and this film obviously ends yet again on a cliffhanger. Thanks to interesting characters, fascinating locations and creative special effects, this third entry in the franchise is however a step in the right direction after the painfully average immediate predecessor. Fans of dystopian science-fiction tales should give this franchise in general and this movie in particular a chance.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Jovovich in Tomb Raider and X-men mode against Zombies,"My comment isn't that different from what I wrote under 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse'. Of course the reason why I watch this one is quality time with family and curiosity regarding the 'heroine's quest'. If this one's a hit then there will surely be another sequel.It ain't that different 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' except that this one has a few more famous actors, it takes place in the desert and it's mostly set during daytime. Our 'heroine', next to being a Tomb Raider hotty, also acquires some X-men superpowers. She's fighting zombies again but this time she's accompanied by the talented Ali Larter and the non-talented Ashanti among a few others. You alos get to see a lot of blood and gore which is (un?)intentionally presented in a comic way.This time the zombies are a result of bad makeup as they look a lot tackier than before. The background score is very similar to that of 'Resident Evil'. Also the director tries to pull a little bit of Alfred Hitchcock's 'Birds'. There are several laugh out loud moments (which certainly wasn't the director's intention).Jovovich's acting is alright. She does look very beautiful in deglam. The rest of the actors don't have anything to do. Even the talented Ali Larter is wasted (but maybe there's something for her in part 4).This film has absolutely nothing new to offer as it's full of clichés and predictability. It seems to be leaning more towards one of those mindless forgettable summer blockbusters. Forgettable entertainment.",,Anonymous,Horror
"With some good action scenes and visuals, Resident Evil: Extinction discards interesting ideas and supporting characters in the name of a story that doesn't hold the viewer","With new director (leaves Paul W. Anderson, now just screenwriter, joins Russell Mulcahy), Resident Evil 3: Extinction is still the best of the three. Too bad this means almost nothing. As much as it brings a slightly safer direction in Mulcahy's hands, the new foray into the world of Racoon City remains unflattering to the game that has won millions of fans for years. And the main loss remains the scary weather. If tension was constant in the game, thanks to the excellent construction of the environment, where anything could happen at any time, in Resident Evil 3: The Extinction Mulcahy's option is for cheap scares and - what is even worse - predictable. It is possible to anticipate all the moments in which something will appear on the screen with the objective of making the viewer jump out of their chair, always with the support of the soundtrack, an old tactic that mediocre filmmakers use to mask the inability to build a growing tension that leaves the audience is always nervous.Likewise, the plot developed by Paul W. Anderson makes no sense at all. In fact, to say that it was developed is a compliment. The script presents the film's setting in an efficient way: the idea of an endangered planet is what the film offers best, even if it demands too much of the spectator's good will when asking him to believe that such devastation could occur in just five years old. But the plot stops there. The story doesn't unfold, confining itself to scenes of survivors battling zombies and facing Umbrella's meaningless plot. We basically have two scenarios: the desert and the old Umbrella facilities. The right parts of the film take place at the first juncture, where the rare survivors battle the zombie plague. Unlike the previous one, this one gets fun points, firstly because it doesn't take itself so seriously and also because the characters are not simple puppets with catchphrases. Despite not being a set that excels in depth, at least they cause a stir in the audience, whether because of the real difficulties or the simple instinct of survival.A change of scenery is very welcome. Changing the color palette from dark and bluish tones to drier colors and desert brown tones, the film has a different feel than we've had before. If before we had people fighting the unknown zombie virus and running for their lives, now we have groups of survivors organized and equipped against the monsters that roam the empty streets of the city of sin, Las Vegas. The new coloring of the film conveys a greater sense of dryness and fatigue, which echoes in the costumes, in the panting breath and in the iron shelters built to allow the refugees a night of rest. Upon finding Alice, we discover that there is an infestation-free location that can serve as a final refuge for exhausted survivors of the fight.This third chapter is steeped in movie clichés of the genre (bitten person who hides the wound for fear of dying, macho hero who sacrifices himself for the greater good, egocentric scientist who goes against common sense in favor of his crazy ideas, among many others) and not just the clichés, but there are rules for zombie movies that have been ignored. For example, you don't put zombies out in the open during the day, precisely because it IS NOT terrifying. By opting for this type of action and working on these concepts. By the way, here comes another detail to be mentioned. Anyone who has never seen the previous films may feel that they don't understand anything about Resident Evil 3: The Extinction for not having followed the story until then. A mistake. Even those who know Alice and Umbrella's past will be lost. There are several questions that remain unanswered, such as: if they could see what Alice saw, why didn't they discover her before? What does Project Alice really consist of? Why kill one clone after another? Why the hell does the big boss show up only in dark glasses? That's not counting the silly moments in the extreme, for example, the companion who refuses to tell that he was bitten, bringing to life everyone's scratches, and the bottomless container that releases an army of thousands of zombies.The dramaturgical absurdities are still present, especially in female hair, which remains smooth, vivid and flowing even without shampoo and in a sandy environment. There is almost never a shortage of ammunition and/or food. But these aspects are well scored, making the experience less traumatic, in some points adding charm to the final product. Even these clichés are overshadowed by many references to classic movies, from The Birds, in a good idea of T-Virus contamination, to Planet of the Apes, with a buried Las Vegas. The most obvious comparisons with Mad Max 2: The Hunt Continues can be seen in the clear inspirations in the locations that form the common world of the film that, in short, rescue the ecology discussed in Highlander II: The Resurrection.Unfortunately, you cannot ignore the shallow plot, with holes and that rarely makes sense. Alice now begins to develop telepathic powers in addition to the physical enhancement she had already received in Apocalypse. Her character even gains a messianic aura close to Neo's in The Matrix. The only thing missing is someone to call The Chosen One. With these additions, the series continues to grow in this need to transform Alice into a character who appears to be more than she is, a motto that has been used since the first film. Not to mention the entire plot of clones that emerges as a backstory that permeates the franchise. No longer a movie about zombie infestation and humanity in the face of it, now we have the journey of a ""sci-fi"" heroine who runs away from an evil corporation that intends to take over the world through science, greed and (surprise) money. Which strikes me as a totally flawed plan, since there is no use in dominating a world taken over by zombies.The story gets a lot better when it takes on the B-movie tone. Resident Evil 3 The Extinction is palatable in that it doesn't deceive the viewer by pretending to be a serious movie. As an action movie little sin, the combats are well filmed, the special effects and makeup of the monsters are right - for the first time. Russell Mulcahy, at least, is a more competent director than Paul W. Anderson and makes the film run more fluidly compared to its predecessors. Even though he's small in insisting on scares (as I've already mentioned), the filmmaker knows how to visually explore the idea of the end of the world, using aerial plans to show the desolation of this near future. Still, the action scenes are not exciting, such as Alice's clash with the dogs - in which you can hardly see - and the anticlimactic ending. However, Mulcahy does quite well on occasion, with one particular scene involving zombie birds and a 360-degree shot that's pretty impressive considering the action we've come to expect from this franchise. The camera bringing the characters' faces closer together, giving a greater emotional touch to each one on the screen is also superior.And then the protagonist Mila Jovovich stands out. The actress has been specializing in action films and convinces when physical effort is required. Her performance, on the contrary, remains apathetic, maintaining the inexpressiveness of other works. The same goes for the rest of the cast, which doesn't arouse any sensation in the viewer, either hate or sympathy. The secondary characters that belong to the franchise were very underused and only serve to be saved by Alice and her new superpowers: Claire Redfield, for example, doesn't even remotely remember the redhead who blew up hundreds of undead heads in search of his brother in the game Resident Evil 2 and the traitor Albert Wesker from RE 1 and RE: Code Veronica here have two or three lines, all of them without the slightest importance in the overall plot. As a matter of fact, you only have to be sure that it's them during the end credits, as the script doesn't have the decency to say the characters' last names.In the end, your conclusion remains as open and confused as the others. Something that already seems to have become a signature of the series: finishing the film in the most nonsense and crazy way possible. And that shows how lost the production team seems to be, as so far Resident Evil has shown not to know what it came from. With a few scares here and there, mediocre action scenes and a weak and extremely present science part, it's hard to classify the genre of this tape. A little more self-deprecating humor and less talented actors would make Resident Evil the perfect trash movie. However, he takes himself seriously enough not to be interpreted that way. A victim of its own ambition, Resident Evil: Extinction discards interesting ideas and supporting characters in the name of a story that doesn't hold the viewer. Resident Evil is a popular and beloved series of games that could become much more than a wave of forgettable and unpalatable movies.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Evil Moves to the Desert,"Week three with ""Resident Evil"" continues in the Nevada desert, earth has been overrun, Umbrella corporation is still evil, and Alice still is not sure what to do with the situation at hand. Ooh, and action.Thanks to desert setting, the scorching sun and sand in the boots, this Resident Evil installment does give off Mad Max vibes, as action is also, once again, kicked into gear. Franchise's only self-set high standard is the action, must be, because story is paper thin and moves at a snail's pace, with plot turns happening after 40 minute prediction and anticipation. Movie's dynamic is in moving from one crazy action set to another, and with dry melodrama in the middle, where we have most of the characters from the 2nd sequel. Victor's death though is one of my favorites in the franchise, because you always have to take a tasty puff from a newly lit cigarette before you die like a man. But, the survivors are surviving, Alice joins, and there's yet another underground lab around the corner, and they really need Alice. And Alice needs to kick butt.What's often admirable and always enjoyable, is Milla Jovovich's dedication to the role of indestructible Alice, a role that never really gains depth through 6 movies. Nonetheless, Milla is the ingredient that has helped the franchise, front and back. This third part is also the better example of a zombie genre film, having it slightly more classic-like this time around. Slightly. Over-the-top action and various different, infected beasts are still present. Horror does preside mostly in what we see and hear, and not really in what we feel. A blockbuster with blood, but as substantial as your average, forgettable PG13 action romp of any kind. Natural evolution continues, the cgi has gotten better, make-up effects are more solid, and it's generally aesthetically more polished. I also miss the awesome theme song and the kind of music they had in the first part, some of it sampled here, but even the original score has been made less atmospheric. Or maybe it's just me.I'd say ""Resident Evil: Extinction"" is one of the best in the series, but that is not to conlude its a great movie. A decent one, a fine horror blockbuster with typical flaws. My rating: 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Resident Evil: Beyond Disappointment,"And once again I will start by saying I’m the big fan of the Resident Evil franchise both game and the movie, that is until what I saw in this movie. This is far beyond the most pointless sequel ever and has almost had nothing to do with anything.Synopsis: Even after the nuclear bomb the city in the previous movie, the Umbrella Corp still couldn’t maintain quarantine, this leads to the spread of virus throughout the world. Alice and her friends must now try to survive and help the other in need.The story, the plot, the holes is indescribably bad. There is no plot just people running around in the desert tried to fight zombie, and birds. There is no character development or hardly any situation development from the previous movie except they changed the location. The story also probably riffs off from many different movies that left you absolutely no way of finding it out. The story was just plan bad and there is absolutely nothing to it. Even after they have turned it into the action movie, the action part itself is rather boring, and out of the blue the zombie is much more aggressive this time.The new cast member in this movie doesn’t add anything in this movie even one bit. Only Ali Larter character seem to be walking around organizing this and that (food, petrol, weapon) which most of it nothing to do with anything but added more screen time to the movie.Lastly: I’m tired to writing. This movie is nowhere close to the first two and probably the most distance from the video game.

A genuinely good action movie.,"I gotta say, I was pleasantly surprised, even though I read the book months prior to the movie release. It was significantly better than its prequel. The characters who died were actually likable, so you actually felt sorry when they died. The scenes where people got eaten were also a lot more gritty. Enough to make me cringe, and I was watching Nightmare on Elm Street when I was 2 years old. The action scenes were visually impressive as well. I will never look at a crow the same way again.I loved this movie, but I gotta say, the best part was Iain Glenn. I'm not a fan of him, but he did an absolutely terrific job in this movie.

A Step Up From the Previous Two,"Resident Evil: Extinction (2007)** (out of 4)Third film in the series has the zombie outbreak wiping out the majority of human life across the world. Alice (Milla Jovovich) leads a small group of survivors through the Nevada desert as they try to make it to Alaska where there are reports that no infections have happened. RESIDENT EVIL: EXTINCTION is a step up from the previous two films but like those this one here starts off extremely well but slowly loses its way as it drags on. I thought the story here was actually the best of the three films because it could have made for a very entertaining survival picture. I thought the idea of these people traveling through the desert and heading towards Alaska could have made for a great adventure movie but sadly the screenplay goes off this mark and instead just goes for routine gunfights and zombie attacks. It's a real shame they didn't try to do more with the story that they started because it could have made for something so much better. Instead we just get the same old stuff as one survivor gets eaten after another and in your typical, boring manor. What's worse is that the final thirty-minutes just drag to the point where you'll be nodding off from boredom. It's a real shame that they couldn't have done more with the final act. Still, Jovovich turns in another good performance in the lead, although it's too bad they decided to wrap her up in a thick jacket instead of the skimpy clothing she wore in previous films. The supporting cast is also much better here, which is a plus. The CGI zombies are quite boring and all the fake computer effect gunshot wounds really add up to little.",,Anonymous,Horror
Not much good going on,"Films adapted from video games generally have received flak mainly for their inability to cater to a larger audience than a specified niche among the audience - mainly teenage boys who spend their free time in front of, eh, video games. It's always a case of you either you like it or you don't.Having said that, I enjoyed the first ""Resident Evil"" (I was 17 then) and marginally liked ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" (I was 19): partly because I was someone who has had an on-off affair with role-playing games (RPGs), specifically with the PS2 console; but mostly because I understood that these kind of movies required no life-affirming morales, no intricate plot, no credible science to provide mental calisthenics. Just pure popcorn entertainment and an unabashed sense of escapism for them to work. Considering these aspects, it's not much to ask.But then comes ""Resident Evil: Extinction"", a third-tier installment (apparently the year of thirds hasn't ended yet) that's so painfully unexciting, it's not just comparable to having to watch someone else play the game; it's like having to watch someone play the game using a walkthrough downloaded from some gaming forum. Everything's too perfunctory and the scare factor is conspicuously several notches lower.Here, Milla Jovovich returns as zombie butt-whooping Alice, five years after the first film, when the Umbrella Corporation's T-Virus has escaped Racoon City and has set humankind into the brink of extinction. Together with a band of survivors that includes a sleepwalking cast of Ali Larter, Ashanti, Oded Fehr and, pity, Spencer Locke, they cross the desert to get to Alaska, which may be their final frontier.Writer Paul W.S. Anderson and director Russell Mulcahy doesn't provide the story with any interesting characters and their treatment of the material is so half-hearted you barely feel the plot as it advances from one point to another. Jovovich still provides a solid central figure but her ho-hum action scenes can't make up for an overall lackluster film.But really, when you're a 20-something male and the best thing you can find about a zombie movie is teen actress Spencer Locke, then there's really not much good going on.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Resident Evil Extinction Okay But Still Flawed,"Resident Evil Extinction is okay but still flawed from director Russell Mulcahy who's admirable in making this third film but the lack of character development, more suspense, and a disappointing third act surprise villain are what weighed this one down the most at least to me. The cast for the most part are good in their roles including Milla Jovovich, Ali Larter, Ian Glen, Mike Epps, and Oded Fehr who's part like many others unfortunately is cut kind of short near the end. The rest of the cast including a brief cameo appearance by Ashanti are okay in their small parts but none of them get a chance to shine because they're written out of the movie rather quickly. The action sequences are well executed and paced. The special effects including the zombies and brief appearances by other creatures are impressive. The villain near the end known as The Tyrant who Glen's character turns into looks terrifying and deadly but his anti-climatic showdown with Jovovich near the conclusion is a letdown. The twist at the end was a bit of a surprise and the ending does leave it open for another one but I think three is enough for now. This movie isn't really that bad there are just flaws that weigh it down which could've been improved . Overall Resident Evil Extinction is decent with enough action, bloody deaths, good special effects, some suspense, a little humor, and solid performances by the cast who make this third entry in the trilogy worth watching but it could've been a lot better.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Alice and a few other survivors are driving around the continent just scrounging for fuel, water and food, basically they are just trying to survive. Milla Jovovich is amazing in this movie with some of the best stunts of the series, she is just a rampaging force going up against the entire zombie army.

Resident Evil: Redeemed,"If you're a fan of the games, then you would have probably mildly enjoyed the first two films in the ""Resident Evil"" franchise. Part one found a group of soldiers exploring an underground labyritnth of lab rooms and crawling with the undead, with only a few people making it back to the surface alive. The ""T-Virus"", created by scientists working for the Umbrella Corporation was unleashed into the lab, which started the whole horror.""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" found the ""T-Virus"" making its way to the surface, killing off the residents of Raccoon city, beneath which the Umbrella Corporation had built the secret lab that contained the virus. When it broke out, the Umbrella Corporation blockaded the city, attempting to keep infection within its walls.Where you thought it was over, it turns out the horror had only begun. The T-Virus, which is spread from one person to another through blood contact, has plagued the world and all of the continents have dried up, turning into barren wastelands in ""Resident Evil: Extinction"". Milla Jovovich returns with another strong performance as Alice, who was the main character in the first two films, having survived and then kidnapped and tampered with by Umbrella now. Now she's loose, fighting the undead and trying to stay alive in the Nevada desert. When Alice comes across a convoy making a desperate stand to stay alive, together they join ranks to bring Umbrella down and to find a cure for the virus.Highly unbelievable, Resident Evil manages to be an exciting horror fantasy, and this third installment is the best. The cinematography, writing, and acting are all top notch here. Director Russel Mulcahy makes this entry run smooth, with plenty of gore and scares to keep die hard horror fans interested. Milla Jovovich is still the best, the tough girl who can do anything. It's campy and fun the whole way, but with a rather disappointing climax. The action is absolutely the best here.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Well...Better than the first two installments,"This starts off almost exactly like RE 1 and makes the audience that has seen the first installment think they are having a deja vu which adds a nice touch to the movie since it starts out with a bang. Although repetitious and dull at times, the director did a decent job with this installment well at least slightly better than the first installment and most definitely way better than the second one. Now it clearly shows that they don't give a crap if it relates with the RE video games or not and just want to cash in though, well at least it was somewhat entertaining.The plot this time is mainly about survival as well, a group a survivors including Alice is trying to survive the zombie mayhem while the head researcher in Umbrella Corporation is trying to find the real Alice for his projects. What I didn't like is how it added psychic powers in the game, which it showed in the second movie in the series. It just did not fit in with this type of movie, even if it's mostly sci fi, I didn't like it, this isn't freaking X-Men. I also didn't like the character L.J., he was annoying in the first movie and is more annoying this time around. Basically a pointless character and a pointless character in the second one as well. When it comes to animal zombies, first it was dogs and now they also have crows in this one which is one of the coolest scenes in the movie when a mass amount of zombie crows start attacking the survivors. Watching the zombie crows was much more entertaining than zombie dogs, I mean kung fu and dogs just looks plain stupid. And sometimes it seems like a war movie with zombies, so yeah although the story is really weak it does have some cool scenes and wasn't annoying to watch.

very good!,"The story fits the franchise, the team is more in the center of attention, yet Alice kicks a$$ and gets a solo run in the finale. This is the goriest of the first three movies in the RE film world. The action is very physical and the CGI is evident wherever we get to see bullet holes in zombie bodies. Milla's face has been digitally altered 90% of her face time. I have no clue why they had to make her obviously younger, but maybe it's because of the story is set 5 years after the second movie.Music by Charlie Clouser is perfect with its reversed cymbals making it a signature sound for this film. Tight and dry drums paired with a score that ain't too intrusive.Enjoy!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Utterly horrible,"This is the worst movie I have seen this year. Character development is totally neglected, the plot lacks any twists and could be written by a 12-year-old monkey.This production crew even didn't shun to use totally stereotypical B-movie props like *rolling tumbleweeds* in the desert hahaha! You just can imagine the fans blowing just outside the viewing area...and this was in the opening scene, I still had to sit through the whole movie :( When I got home from seeing this movie, I was so bored that I just checked out a few YouToube videos on my laptop that figured crashing RC airplanes - Yes, it's that bad...",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good enough,"Resident Evil, part 3. The story continues so it would be a good idea to watch the other two as well before seeing this one otherwise some things will be missed. So where are we now? Alice is roaming the Earth, the T-virus has escaped from the laboratory, and survivors are on the run. Oh, and not to forget, Umbrella Corporation is chasing Alice. So, all in all, more of the same.When I was watching this film I was more than once reminded of the Mad Max series and some other post-apocalypse films but not in an entirely bad way. The start of the film is a wee bit slow and there are a few odd bits in there that don't exactly match up with the previous two films, but the complete set is pretty much OK, apart from the slow start.The ending gives a good reason for a part 4 to be made and if it does get made I will be seeing it. This film could have been better, but it was a worthy watch as it is, if you liked the first two that is. Personally I loved the soundtrack, it matches the film very well. Especially the song that plays when the ending credits start.Good enough, 7 out of 10 shooter up games made into film",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Okay as a Road Warrior style post-apocalyptic film...  But a great zombie franchise sequel?  Not so much.,"In the not too distant future, viral weaponry research and development goes all wrong. What follows is an entertaining vision for any fan of zombie pandemic stories or just plain world/human survival style films. The first film in this franchise is decidedly the best with as-believable-as-can-be ideas, nifty effects, a decent (not over-the-top) story. The second and third films, however, move pretty far away from the basic zombie survival story and much further into character-based stories with a focus on splinter/spin-off concepts like wildly comic book/cartoonish science fiction elements. So if you enjoy movies that are based on comic books or video games that will require you to accept a lot of really over-the-top ideas (like superpowers, supernatural powers, CHUD-style mutation, magic, etc.), then you will still enjoy the latter two films since they are not bad on that merit. They're also okay as general apocalyptic survival stories. However, as a fan of the zombie genre, if you were expecting a solid continuation of the basic story of zombie infection from the first film, these sequels will let you down. The Romero-style zombies in these films are really just extras that apparently just needed to be in the background making room for more intense and faster (though much less believable) antagonists. Maybe this is because films like 28 Days/Weeks and Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead have done much to turn the volume down on lumbering old-style zombies and Paul W.S. Anderson felt that he needed to crank up the action factor.In RE3, our heroes finally figure out that moving to near the arctic circle would be a good move (you know, COLD + ZOMBIE = IMMOBILE ZOMBIE), and decide to hoof it to Alaska after learning of a possible isolated colony of survivors there. There are a number of new twists on the infection (you will be thinking of Bud The Zombie and/or Bud The CHUD at a few points), and there will be more Boyle/Snyder style zombie goodness to contend with mixed in with the normal zombie hoards.There were, however, some hold-out thematic elements from the first two films. There are zombie Doberman pinchers, creepy hologram girls with British accents, plenty of zombie-around-the-corner jump-in-your-seat moments, and of course Alice either naked or in hot Road Warrior-style tactical gear. There is the terrible T-Virus infection, and the perfect anti-virus strait out of the X-Files. There are new hints at the answers to old questions, and some new things to think about that still relate to the basic T-Virus. And without a doubt, there's the recurring theme of the evil big corporation (The Umbrella Corp. A.K.A. Halliburton + Merck + United Healthcare) which caused the mess but has managed to out-survive governments and massive population decimation. The moral here? What happens when a capitalistic society allows a private entity to become too powerful? The evil private scientists always plot to rule the world at the expense of the common population.Anyway, I don't go to the theater to see films often, but I try to make it to the big-budget zombie flicks... However, on the merit of being a zombie film, I could have waited for this one to roll to DVD...",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"It's entertaining, and it definitely delivers what we expect from this series, and Anderson... for better or for worse","When a man continually writes scenes in which his fiancée appears naked(if not seen fully nude, save for glimpses which many a teen boy have undoubtedly paused and gone frame by frame to... admire; ah, the wonders of the DVD format), is he ""sharing the wealth"", or is he being a pompous jerk, rubbing her looks in our faces? Mind you, even if that particular fact does not make Anderson a jerk, there can easily be found other reasons to thrust that title of dubious honor upon him... in fact, I'm quite sure there are plenty who use far more explicit and visually descriptive phrases to describe the man. I don't know that I dislike him; it's actually almost funny, what he does. He writes horror that takes place in tight spaces, claustrophobic areas, he has gratuitous gore, he fills his work with loud, noisy rock music, he does action and horror with little respect for proper pacing or character development, his scripts are thin as, ironically, paper, and holed like Swiss cheese that's been attacked with a machine-gun, and last but not least, he insists on surprising his audience, pulling the rug out from underneath them, even though these surprises are at the expense of sense and logic. In spite of all of this, he manages to keep getting work. It's impressive, in an odd kind of way. And people do keep watching his stuff, in spite of how he treats the source material(before this franchise, there was Mortal Kombat, and he's also done Alien Versus Predator, managing to mess up *two* franchises that had good movies between them, well-done games made about them, and, so I hear, comics of, yet again, notably high quality). But I digress. Fear not, patient reader(as I'm sure you must be, for still reading this review), the introduction is over, and I will comment on the title itself, now. First off, Jill and Angie are gone, without even a mention of them. It's not even stated if they're dead or not. However, the very ending of the second film, for any who have watched it, *is* followed up on. The plot starts some time(every time I hear how long, it's a different amount of years) after Apocalypse. There's a different feel to some of it, with the characters much more mobile than in the first two. The script is about as bad as that of the usual Anderson film, but this still manages to be more entertaining and effective(if still not powerful, involving or engaging) because of one thing... the direction. With Witt of the second not in charge, and Anderson only writing, having not directed one of these since the first, it actually manages to rise... above the material? Possibly. It comes off as less obviously flawed than the second, though that may be more a matter of presentation than of content. With Valentine gone, another female known from the games is brought in... namely Claire Redfield. She's portrayed by Ali Larter, who does fine. Jovovich does fine again, albeit being less of a bad-ass than she was when we last saw Alice. She does still kick ass, and she's not the only one. The action varies, but some of it is definitely cool. The camera and editing, with the few exceptions where it confuses the viewer as to what's going on(which really doesn't extend beyond an early and utterly useless scene), really does a good job. Some of the action is really, really cool. In addition to Claire, other characters are brought in, though few do anything. Spencer Locke spends most of her on-screen time screaming or crying, with one of her only lines regaling the tale of how she gained her silly name. Epps stopped being funny at some point in-between the second movie and this one. The violence and gore is surprisingly tame(and there's less nudity and such), both for an R, and for an entry in this series. The make-up, however, is back, helping us viewers put behind us the pitiful excuse for not doing such, that was the presentation of the zombies in Apocalypse. The effects, in general, are quite good. The story borrows a bunch... from the first, in fact. Some bits are almost too close. The film is in a rush, as the others, and wouldn't have been bad off were it longer. The pace is intense. Near the ending, the movie gets too busy setting up a sequel(what comes after extinction? Although, one could have posed the same question just years ago, with ""apocalypse"" being the word), when it should be trying to properly finish of this one. The new monster, for my money, is great. The frights vary, some are jump-scares. All in all, the film isn't bad, and definitely delivers, if you liked the first two. The score has some hints to the main theme of the first, which I personally thought was excellent. I recommend this to any fan of the first two and of Anderson in general, as well as the actors. If you liked either of the first two, I'd say give this one a chance. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Alice and the fight scenes are fantastic.  The rest?  Not so much,"I should make clear the fact that I have yet to see the first and second Resident Evils. The movie trilogy is based off the popular and critically-acclaimed video game series, of which I am a foreigner to also. So, this review is written by someone who has zero knowledge of any previous story lines in the series. Everything I now know about Resident Evil -it's characters, story lines, and everything else- is based off of what I learned watching Extinction.With that being said, I thought Extinction was a very entertaining movie. The story follows Alice (Jovovich), a genetically-enhanced woman as she and a band of other remaining humans try to survive through attacks from millions of zombies. Where did all the zombies come from? In the first Resident Evil, the Umbrella Corporation let loose a deadly virus that infects all people and, once the people are infected, turns them into flesh-craving zombies. The infected aren't just humans though- animals (including crows and dogs) are susceptible to the virus and can thus be infected and changed into dangerous creatures. All this begs the question: who on the decaying Earth can stop the paranoia? Enter Alice, the woman who was genetically altered by the mad scientists of the Umbrella Corp. Alice is essentially a super-human; she can generate force fields and has ridiculous strength. After avoiding all human contact, Alice eventually runs into the group of people who are doing their best to survive but could obviously use some help. With most of their attempts failing and time running out, the group (somehow) learns that Alaska is the only safe zone left on the planet. They can only get there once they pass through Las Vegas (I don't get it either). However, they get sidetracked and end up in some pretty intense fights with the living dead.These fights are sporadic but pick up towards the end of the movie. They are really intense, and the zombies on the receiving ends of the attacks are absolutely destroyed. Blood spurts and flies as bullets pierce heads, arms, limbs, etc. While her crew doesn't add much to the fights, you best believe Alice does her part: she is a complete bad ass slashing through zombies with that piercing stare from her ice-cold blue eyes. Classic lead females Ellen Ripley and The Bride came to mind as I watched Alice. In a recent IMDb.com poll with 21,683 votes, users were asked to vote on which female (Ripley, Alice, or Sarah Conner) they would most want to protect them. Ripley won with 39% of the vote, but second place went to Alice, with 22%. As you can see, I'm not her only fan.You'll notice I'm not talking about the supporting cast. Well, to be honest, there isn't much to say about them: they add little to the story and have very generic roles. They come off more as enhancer talent for Alice.I plan on renting the first two in the series now so I can more thoroughly understand the series. I liked the ideas and the action, and especially the lead heroine. Extinction was rough around the edges, but at it's core was a solid movie which was loads of fun to watch.Good) Jovovich owns the movie as Alice, very intense action sequences Bad) story is all over the map, supporting cast offers little to nothing",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Alice in Zombieland,"In Extinction, the third instalment of the Resident Evil series, the deadly T-Virus has escaped the confines of Raccoon City and contaminated the rest of the world. Zombies now outnumber the living and, as the number of survivors on the planet's surface gradually dwindles, Umbrella Corp experts deep beneath the Nevada desert attempt to perfect an anti-virus.Meanwhile, genetically enhanced zombie-killing babe Project Alice (Milla Jovovich) travels the country searching for other uninfected humans.Sporting the latest in sexy post-apocalyptic desert-wear (which naturally includes stockings and suspenders), the drop-dead-gorgeous, high-kicking, gun slinging, slayer of the undead cuts a swathe through legions of shambling corpses (and zombie crows!), rescuing a rag-tag convoy of demoralised people in the process.Alice convinces their leader, Claire Redfield (Heroes hottie Ali Larter), to lead her convoy to Alaska, where she believes they will be safe from contamination. But first they must head for Las Vegas, where they hope to find enough fuel to last the journey North.Unfortunately, nasty Umbrella Corp scientist Dr. Isaacs, who has been tracking Alice via satellite, has a nasty surprise in store for our heroine and her new pals when they eventually reach Vegas: he's prepared a container full of extremely nasty zombies to greet them!Helmed by hit-and-miss director Russell Mulcahy, and written by the equally unreliable Paul W.S. Anderson, Resident Evil: Extinction could have gone either way. I am pleased to report, however, that the guys were on form with this film, and deliver a hugely enjoyable and visually impressive sci-fi/horror yarn that, despite being rather derivative (Day of the Dead, anyone?) and occasionally a little too silly (Alice's telekinesis), is packed with enough action (great stunts, explosions, crashes), gore (juicy zombie bites, knife attacks, bullets in the head), and scares (yes, I admit that I jumped) to guarantee horror fans a good time.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Jovovich returns in fine ass-kicking form in otherwise relentless entry to the tedious franchise,"RESIDENT EVIL: EXTINCTION (2007) **1/2 Milla Jovovich, Oded Fehr, Ali Larter, Iain Glen, Ashanti, Christopher Egan, Spencer Locke, Matthew Marsden, Linden Ashby, Jason O'Mara, Mike Epps.

Soulless garbage.,"Despite the fact that this movie is based on a video game, in truth nothing works in this film, or whatever you may call ""it"". Why make a movie based on a video game when the storyline and plot works just fine on the small screen? Face it; RE1 and 2 sucked, BIG TIME. The special effects and the setting is great(bombed-out deserted Las Vegas, great idea) but what's the point if there's no solid foundation to work from? The script is filled with so much cheese and plain flat ""acting"" that I cared very little about the characters or the story for that matter. And since when did the main character ever lept up in the air to kick a zombie in the face? I've never played the Resident Evil games(though I plan on doing so since I'm new to the franchise) but for those who did this is a direct contradiction of the games where the focus is on gunplay and puzzle solving. Never once do the characters display any sense of brainpower that the characters in the games did. In the end, they just blow the zombies away in typical B-movie fashion.I'm tired of Hollywood. No really I AM!!! Someone PLEASE end these soulless heaps of garbage before the movie industry as a whole becomes a lost art.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Alice in Monsterland,"I am a huge fan of the video game series; I've played & completed almost every Resident Evil game there is. The first one is one of my most favourite films and the second was also good but not better than the first. After watching the ending of the second I knew that there will be a third instalment but I had no idea how they will continue.To be honest I didn't really like Resident Evil: Extinction when the first time I seen it. My friend wanted to watch it and I watched it again to give him company and then I liked it. Every scene made better sense and was much more entertaining. The movie was set in the Nevada desert and filled with intense special effects and more zombie terror!The story was continued very well from the second one and was very different, intelligent and original. Albert Weskar & Claire Redfield were introduced and they didn't have much to do in the film maybe they will in the fourth part, which will be called Resident Evil: Afterlife and Leon will probably be in it.The zombies look like sand zombies and they are odd but it was a good idea because the whole world is covered with sand. There were a few jumpy moments and you have no idea whenever they can appear. The best scene is when Alice was fighting Isaacs near the end and my friend said that ""He is similar to Tyrant in the first Resident Evil game"" but I don't think so because Tyrant has a claw hand. He was very similar to a monster in Resident Evil: Code Veronica X that has a small head and is able to stretch its arm out and grab you.Overall it is the kind of film that gets better the more times you watch it and is well made for a post-apocalyptic thriller. It was made with a budget of $45 million & grossed the most money out of all three about $147 million worldwide.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the worst films I have ever seen.,"OK is it really called for to use material from 5 different movies?? X-Men 3, Birds, Star Wars, Carrey, and Day of the Dead. For the reviews for this movie so far, how much is the company that made it paying you to say it was good? I have never once walked out of a movie, and I was about to tonight. It was not worth the free ticket I used to see it. The only good thing about this ""movie"" was the action scenes. Personally, I don't know why a woman with the body of a 12 year old boy is trying to be sexy either. It doesn't work. As far as the acting, I've seen better acting in soft core porn movies late at night on the premium channels.

Another one for the ... desert,"As with the second one continuing where the first one left off, this does continue where the second left us. And again it does make sense, to have seen the movies that came before this one. One welcome addition (survivor from part 2) in this one, is Oded F. He really grounds things and his role seems to get expanded (though you never know in a movie like this, now do you?).He was also commenting on part 2, though I haven't listen to any audio commentary for this part (they are entertaining, even if you didn't quite like the movies ... if you liked them you will relish them anyway).

4 out of 5 action rating,"It's rare to find a sequel that puts an original to shame. So you can imagine that it would be almost impossible to find a fourth installment that is better than the first. Well the search is over. Not only does ""Extinction"" beat out the other Resident Evil's in scale of action, it edges them in overall quality as well...not that it matters. If you're watching a zombie movie based on a video game, you probably don't care how deep the plot is. In this installment, Alice continues her search for the mythical, virus-free ""Arcadia."" While flying her plane over a desolate, post-apocalyptic Los Angeles, she decides to land on the roof of a maximum security prison to come to the aid of some survivors. It's hard enough to escape from prison, but how do you pull it off when the prison is surrounded by a zombie army? Loading your shotgun shells with metal coins is a good first step. ""Extinction"" would fit nicely in a list of the Top 20 zombie movies of all. It would also not be out of place on a list of the top 3 video game films of all time.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Talk about pathetic movie,Any true fan of resident evil will have to admit that the directors of these pathetic movies didn't take much consideration of the games. All they had to do was simply go by the games and they could have endless greatness. However like Hollywood does it screws up a good thing. This film was pathetic in my opinion. This story has no substance at all to me. The dialogue is horrific and the actors are horrible. There are so many jacked up parts in this movie. There ends up being some hybrid zombies that are a lot like the ones on 28 days later. They're super quick and very aggressive. If this movie would've been made in the 80's with a pitiful budget then they might be able to get away with it but the fact is the budgets there so why pick up crappy actors. I mean come on they got the dude that played johnny cage in mortal combat. Then you have ashanti with her masterpiece of a dialogue......she was pathetic. All in all this movie is cheesy and down right retarded. The ending.....oh boy the ending. It was so stupid and will make you say...give me a break. This film is not even a renter in my opinion.

Very good action/horror movie,"This was a surprisingly good movie. Definitely the best one out of the three made. I think this film is somewhat under appreciated and under rated. In fact, the more I think about this movie the more I want to see it again, its that kind of movie.It had scary parts along with well done action sequences. Milla Jovovich was really good in it, you can tell she was in great shape for the movie. It was an entertaining movie to watch throughout and never got boring.Nice cinematography in the filming of the desert, and a world that was devastated in the future was presented in a believable way. The evil villain was played well by the actor and was memorable. The story moved at a good pace and made sense in the ""universe"" the movie created. Some good performances by other actors also, the acting all around was better than expected.This is a movie I would consider buying and I don't think that of many movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Better than the last two, but that's not saying much","When it comes to movie monsters, zombies never really appealed to me. They seem to exist more as moving targets in a shooting gallery than actual villains. And let's face it, just about everything you can do in a zombie movie has already been done. Resident Evil: Extinction seems to realize this, and so it doesn't really concentrate on them very much. They're always there, but they don't seem to have much to do with the movie itself. Rather than horror, the film's main source of inspiration seems to be the Road Warrior films, with everyone driving around in souped up vehicles in the desert.Those who have not seen the original Resident Evil or its sequel, Resident Evil: Apocalypse, will likely be lost, as the film jumps right into its story and doesn't look back. Series heroine Alice (Milla Jovovich) is still on the run from the evil scientists of the Umbrella Corporation, who experimented on her and turned her into some kind of super powered fighting machine. While wandering the deserts, searching for other survivors, she happens to find a battered old journal that talks about how there's an area in Alaska that is unaffected by the deadly T-Virus that has wiped out half the human race, and turned the other half into flesh-eating zombies. She joins up with a band of survivors, which include a couple people who accompanied her on her last adventure, and some newcomers such as a teenage girl named K-Mart (Spencer Locke from Monster House), who was given the name because the people she travels with found her outside of a K-Mart store. When I heard this, I couldn't help but think the poor girl is lucky she wasn't found outside of a Hooters restaurant. As Alice and her friends search for enough fuel and supplies for the long journey to Alaska, an evil scientist at Umbrella named Dr. Isaacs (Iain Glen) is secretly tracking Alice, because he believes she has something in her blood that can stop the effects of the virus, and wants to use her for his own evil ends.Now that the film franchise is on its third installment, I think it's pretty safe to say you already know where you stand on Resident Evil: Extinction. Those who liked the last two are certain to find something to like here. The Resident Evil films have always differed from the games that inspired them, in that they are much more action-heavy in tone than genuine horror. The zombies themselves are not really the villains, it is the human scientists of the Umbrella Corporation. The head of Umbrella is a guy named Albert Wesker (Jason O'Mara), who even though he sits in a dark underground room behind a desk all day, he constantly wears sunglasses. This is the kind of movie where we know everything about the person just by looking at them. If they are beautiful, rugged, or with a perfectly toned body, they're the good guys. If they're dressed in lab coats or wear black, they're evil. And if they're dirty and unshaven, they're an extra and most likely expendable during one of the film's many action sequences. The movie is in far too much of a rush to get to where it's going. It gives us just enough exposition and plot to get the story out of the way, then dives head first into a series of action sequences that seem to come one after another.To be fair, some of the sequences are handled quite well, and with a surprising amount of expertise. A lengthy sequence where the human survivors are attacked by hundreds of zombie crows is the closest the movie ever comes to generating suspense. But far too often, Extinction is a laundry list of missed opportunities. There is a scene where the heroes are forced to drive through the ruins of Las Vegas, which is now submerged under sand. The initial glimpse of the submerged city is intriguing, and made me excited about what the filmmakers could be planning with such a unique setting. Unfortunately, all they do is give us more of everything we've already seen. I hate it when a movie teases me with a fascinating image, then does absolutely nothing with it. Aside from a character climbing up a replica of the Eifel Tower from the remains of the Paris-themed hotel/casino, the movie does not use any of its unique setting to its advantage. The battle may as well have taken place in a factory or a parking garage for all this movie cares. The human characters are treated with the same level of indifference. No one gets to say any dialogue that doesn't advance the plot in some way, and relationships between them are hinted at but never really built on.At its best, Resident Evil: Extinction is total in one ear and out the other entertainment. It has a couple action scenes that I sort of admired, but nothing really stood out about it. It doesn't offer any thoughts, it doesn't offend, it's just there. People who go to the movies just to get out of the house are sure to have their needs fulfilled. It manages to kill an hour and a half, and that's about it. Anyone looking for something more should probably look elsewhere. Now that I think about it, people looking for something more probably don't go to movies based on video games in the first place.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
The BEST of the trilogy,"I would have to stay that Resident Evil: Extinction is officially the best out of the entire trilogy. Many factors contributed to this one of them being the storyline.Although the storyline could use some improvement I thought it was a major progress compared to Apocalypse and the first RE film. The movie added more elements such as romance, the loss of a loved one, as well as friendship.The movie takes itself much more seriously than the previous installment and definitely meets your expectations.The visual effects are great and one of the high lights of the movie was the Crow Scene. I would really recommend people seeing this movie in theaters.The actors were well chosen and all acted their parts perfectly. All even down to the minor actors and actresses who did a very good job of acting their part. Milla Jovovich really put a tremendous performance as Alice this time around outdoing her two performances in the last two movies.I really recommend everyone to catch this movie in theatres.

"Russell Mulcahy is back for a fun, but not immortal, movie","I like ""Highlander"" and I like Zombies, so I went to see this movie, even though I didn't saw the previous ones and ain't too aware of the video game (I've played once or twice to one of them, but I'm not fanatic about video-games). In my mind, the movie was a crossover between sword duels with living dead and cheap visual kitch effects. Well, I wasn't disappointed. I'm sure that the desperate high-tech visual touch of the movie will become kitch in no time (let's wait ten years and see how old this movie gets). But what I particularly enjoyed are the absurd fights robbed in a referential package, that pleased the B-movie lover in me.""Extinction"" is surely not an intellectual movie, not even a Tarantino-like post modern film, but the way the movie deals with cinephilic references is quite intriguing. Two examples (but the movie is full of scenes like that) : there's an obvious Hitchcock'homage when infected crows began to attack people as in ""The Bird"". And of course, I especially like the ""Day of the dead"" parody, that you can see through the all movie that confronts a mad scientist with stupid soldiers. Romero's parody culminates in a hilarious scene, where the crazy scientist believed he archived to domesticate one of the dead, but the finally doesn't seem so ready to be a human slave.The visual aspect of the movie is most intriguing part of the film. I don't know about the first ones, but ""Resident Evil"" manage to be a gore movie (with blood and rotten living dead), but also tries to be clean, just like a numeric video game. I think I never saw blood looks so clean on a movie before, and for that, ""Extinction"" is quite unique. It's like a gore movie made for the all family to watch. To sum up, there's funny references, well done action and fight scenes, and a rather unusual visual style that makes ""Resident Evil : Extenction"" a rather funny and pleasant moment.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Must we have a fourth?,"It was obvious to everyone that we were going to see this movie based on the end of the second one, Im not going to spill any spoilers on the plot or there lack of it but we are left wide open for a fourth instalment of this series. In all honesty if you have and respect for the series I would leave it at the second chapter, this movie really doesn't have any proper plot line and I was left feeling rather baffled at what Id just spent the last hour and twenty five minutes doing, my time would have just as well been spent at the toilet through this movie.Other than the key fact of Alice, Umbrella and Zombies this is as much as your going to get in way of a tie to the other movies, you find nothing more out in this than you knew from the second. Granted the action and special effects are sweet, there's a few good scenes that I enjoyed watching but that doesn't make for a good movie.Advice: See what else is running and only see it if your a die hard fan, but even then I think some may leave feeling no value for money.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
The latest remake...of extinction,"The Extinction follows much of the same structure as earlier sequels; the biovirus is out in the wild, zombies everywhere, Umbrella corp. Is the trying to benefit from its disastrous deeds and Alice(Jovovich) is developing overwhelming mutational skills. Comparing to earlier sequels this one is more like the first part, less humorous and action movie style than Apocalypse. Plot is not very convincing, main thrills seems to have been borrowed this time from Mad Max, Aliens, perhaps Hitchcock.Also, characters are indeed very thin as typically in action movies. However, Alice developing her physical and especially psychokinetic powers is very impressive theme (and as becomes evident in the film probably this will be developed in following parts?). All in the film goes on like freight train, much of action, much of horror, nothing much to note, nothing much to complain.Although the film may not be very satisfying itself (as compared to first part), the main theme (extinction) is. Haven't seen a movie, so successfully describing the deserts and hopeless lands after the world wide catastrophe. Extinction very successfully creates the feeling of post Nuclear War world. For that, watching it as an picturesque example of its theme, the film is just perfect. The colors, the deserts, the road movie theme (stolen, of course from Mad Max II), all seems to fit just fine. In that the film saves the day and probably boxed it home too, so hopefully we are too see more sequels (which probably won't be as much of quality(?). One more thing, the music is again quite impressive, a bit of ambient, a bit of metal. There's an interesting remake of White Rabbitt but I don't recognize the band...",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The best one yet,"During the first two 'Resident Evil' films I had a tough time working out exactly why I wasn't enjoying them as much as I could be. It took this third chapter 'Resident Evil: Extinction' to clarify for me exactly what the problem was. The first two did not feel like movies. They felt like a video game - only without the fun of actually playing it. Like watching a friend play while you just sit there I suppose. No fun at all. Now, in this third addition to the series, they've worked out that they're actually making a FILM series here, and the finished product is all the better for it.This one plays out more like a horror film for the most part, compared to the originals which I would classify more as actions. There is still plenty of action in this one, but the overall theme does seem to be to give the audience both a fright and an excess of blood and gore. The zombies in this one were a lot better done than in the first two films as well. Finally they were genuinely menacing and had a cool look about them too.There's a tremendous amount that this film got right. It learnt from the mistakes of the previous films and it made corrections where necessary. Who said sequels can't be better than originals? 'Resident Evil: Extinction' proves that this is certainly not the case.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The best of the resident evil movies.,"The first two resident evil movies weren't the most faithful of game based movies .Resident evil: extinction is no different , but what it lacks in staying true to its source material, it makes up for in being fast and entertaining, if a little superficial.Its by no means perfect- there's more po faced exposition than actual dialogue and despite there being a lot of characters fighting for survival, there's no real character development or any of the sort of drama you'd expect from the scenario this film offers. But then again, maybe asking that of resident evil: extinction is asking for too much. This is this the kind of film where a sexy babe with two blades fights zombies , evil crows and mutant dogs-which is an indication of what you'll get with this.And speaking of sexy babes with blades, millia does her action hero thing brilliantly . As usual she isn't given a huge stretch for her acting muscles, but she kicks ass with conviction - which is a good thing since this film is full of action.And that action is frequent, entertaining and well directed (if a little shaky with the camera work).It doesn't come close to any zombie movie classic i could name, but resident evil: extinction is a competently handled, entertaining and action packed film . Best of the resident evil movies.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Low-quality Hollywood suspense for the masses....,"I normally don't write negative reviews, but having watched the two first Resident Evil movies this must have been one of the biggest disappointments in a long time. To be honest, the franchise is pretty embarrassing overall, but this just about sums up what a crap movie should contain; lack of story, ridiculous ""zombies"" and a worn-out hero that merely plays on her admittedly physical appearance. The acting is awful, the ""professor-turned-super villain/mutated monster"" is laughable and the whole fight in the dessert feels terribly worn out.If RE:Extinction is an indicator of what ""science fiction"" film investors are willing to depart with their capital for, we have a bleak future ahead of us! This is no science fiction, just cheap horror for the masses. I sincerely hope that they discontinue the franchise and turn the ship around quickly.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
This movie doesn't deserve a summary.,"If I wanted to watch 95 minutes of loud noises, I would've went on youtube and watched one of those shock videos over and over again every 10 minutes. At least in the previous movie there was things going on. In this one, they were either sitting on their asses or slowly walking down a hallway, pausing, and getting attacked by a zombie. Seriously, there could've been less of this. Would it've killed them to actually show the zombie sneaking up before them? Or growling a bit before they screeched at the top of their lungs? I sat by a damn speaker, for crying out loud.I mean yeah, it's nice to have a loud, shocking noise every once in a while but this movie relied on it. I couldn't count the amount of these. Someone could die of a heart attack watching this. I'm fifteen and my heart is still beating fast. What happens when a 60 year old has a heart attack? Then they have a lawsuit on their hands. This movie was horrible, and it just goes to show that loud noises don't make a zombie movie good- the actions of the characters and zombies do. By the way, here's a heads up: Don't get excited about seeing huge crowds of zombies.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Extinction Is Coming,"The third installment of the Resident Evil franchise that does not disappoint.Alice continues her journey through the desert environment and meets a convoy with Claire Redfield and Carlos Olivera.Personally, I think the third sequel is even slightly better than the second one, although the second one is not bad at all. This one is slightly better directed and the special effects are slightly better.Milla Jovovich is again excellent in the role of Alice, and Ali Larter did a great job in the role of Claire. Alice continues her fight against the Umbrella Corporation.The film is full of excellent action scenes and brutal battles with monsters. A really fun franchise that can be watched again and again. This is a good example of how this kind of film should be made. Fun, fast and brutal.Iain Glen is brilliant as dr. Isaacs, excellent villain. The film again has a good soundtrack, and the atmosphere is tense and ominous.Another great addition to the Resident Evil franchise that continues the interesting story and is definitely worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The better one out of the first 3,"I've been watching the movies in succession and I can totally say that this was the best one out of the first 3. While the plot is still a bit generic, the action sequences, visual style and pacing are very improved. Alice looked badass and this time around I believed it. Claire thrown in the mix is kind of an ""appeal"" move more than her significance in the movie itself but its still pretty cool. Finally, the foreshadowing is very obvious in almost every scene so that kind of throws the shock effect out of the window. Score: 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Costa Del Zombie,"Sunshine? Sand? Las Vegas? Sounds like the perfect holiday... but not in Resident Evil Extinction! This is the world where ravenous zombies attack in broad daylight.Resident Evil Extinction definitely takes the zombie genre in a new direction, breaking the conventions of the usual films in this category. Gone are the days where zombies roam dark, fog laden roads, where the survivors have only everyday items as weapons, where the zombies are the primary threat...The film uses wide camera angles to show the isolation of the last strand of survivors in this desolate environment. The cinematography is beautiful, from the wide open plains of the Nevada desert to the confined spaces of an Umbrella Corporation facility.The soundtrack follows a similar style from the last two films, with pounding techno-rock numbers that really get the blood pumping and mirror the relentless action that's on screen.Overall, this film follows the style over substance feel that the series has followed since day one however, it's one of those films you can watch with little thought. Pure entertainment! Worth a watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""A cross between the Mad Max Series and Night of the Living Dead""","My summary title is thanks to professional reviewer Philip French and appropriately sums up this flick and my account of it.The opening scene shows the female lead nude in the bath and in the version of the movie I watched on cable has her naked body ""bubbled out"" and when any actor smoked a cigarette there was similar censorship; yet countless scenes of bloody killing with heads and bodies blown to bits are left untouched! This film is part of a series itself but basically the world is infected with a virus, zombies walk the earth, our heroine has supernatural powers,a few ""goodies"" are trying to survive in the desert, there is a mad scientist who is part of an evil underworld etc and whatever. Some clever special effects makes this ""nonsence"" more or less watchable. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

They then said the only other film that looks OK that is on is resident evil extinction i had only seen number 1 and this was the third so i was thinking i would'not understand the movie at all but in actually fact it had a very easy to understand story. Packed full of over the top violence and lots of gore with fantastic acting (particularly by Milla Jovovich). This film is guaranteed to make you jump out of your seat. The film also like the others made you feel very attached to Alice (Milla Jovovich) and the rest of the characters.

Third time is still just about the charm,"Extinction follows a group of survivors of the Raccoon city disaster whom are trying to reach Alaska (which is apparently a decontaminated zone). Along the way they cross paths with Alice (one of the original survivors) whom offers to assist them. Unbeknownst to Alice, she is being surveilled by evil Dr Isaacs whom has his own nefarious plans for Alice...In order to try and be positive I will initially try and focus on some of things that I liked about Extinction; for starters it is an expansion on the previous films and does have interesting elements within the story; at this point in the franchise we have reached the stage where scientists are researching and trying to domesticate the undead. Whilst this is interesting my one criticism with this film is that it isn't explored better (though perhaps this is something that is expanded on later in the franchise).Extinction is more focussed on narrative than its predecessors which may not be to all tastes; the heavier focus on story takes away from the action and fun that was prevalent in the first 2 films which ultimately makes Extinction a slightly less exciting offering than parts 1 and 2.As with the first 2 films many of the cast are disposable fodder, but I was pleased to see that Iain Glen was used better in this film allowing him to put in a solid performance and give the film that little bit of class.Those who favour story over action may enjoy this one slightly more than its predecessors and while I love a good story, for me, the fast-paced entertainment of the first 2 films just edges out the slightly more expansive story on offer here.Extinction is still good, but loses a star or two simply by virtue of it not quite being as entertaining as the first 2 films.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Wow I don't know if I can hate a movie more,"So I just saw it and was severely disappointed after loving the first two movies. This movie is nothing other a mixture of other classic zombie movie plots. I suppose the writers thought that no one watches the ""Night of the Living Dead"" series of movies anymore. This movie is almost the same series of events that took place in the second movie of the Living dead series. And using the chick from the other zombie movies was a lame move there are other actresses that have not done films in the zombie genre. Every time she was in scene I had to remind myself of which movie I was watching since this movie also reminded me of the other movie she was in.I really expected a lot more imagination from the movie. The events and deaths are totally predictable and that pretty much defeats the purpose of an action/horror type movie. I really expected a more interesting ending as well.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Although the film has its flaws, I absolutely love it!","I absolutely love the resident evil films as I have watched them all lots of time, it might be just me who is taken in by Milla Jovovich,Oded Fehr and Ali Larterand acting skills but this has to be one of the best films yet and me being a huge fan of the films thought they wouldn't be able to do a better job. Although the film has its flaws like the new easier killing zombies who can be killed by slashing the through or shooting them in the mid-drift a slight flaw they didn't think through but it is still an outstanding film! The thing I love most about this film is that it doesn't fit into the stereotypical zombie film, like running round a confined space like in the first film or set in the middle of a big city over run by the undead like in the second film instead it is set slap bang in the middle of a desert in the day time only a really good director could make that type of a film scary!

"Human Nature to the Test in ""Resident Evil: Extinction""","The Raccoon City T-virus Outbreak is scary. Its spread in the USA is scarier. Now, global infection is a lot scarier. This is the premise of ""Resident Evil: Extinction"".I like how the Raccoon City residents are now living like the ancient people. They hunt for food, water, and other supplies vital for survival. You'll feel bad for the children in the school bus. Seeing Las Vegas in ruins is fascinating, as it is always alive. During the story course, you'll get confused about the events in a certain Umbrella underground lab. Dr. Isaacs is seen a lot, but his purpose is hidden to the audiences. I like how Alice uses the kukri knives against the zombies, which signify the scarcity of long-range weapons.This is also a horror movie, so expect some characters to die. The death scenes are accompanied with good musical score that I really felt moved by these scenes. A death-related plot twist comes along, and this is very tough to watch. I can't believe it happened. The final scene of this film will make you scratch your head about where Alice's fate is actually going.It's great that ""Resident Evil: Extinction"" has surpassed ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"". This film's ending is a loose thread, which calls for another movie to continue. If the production crew plans to make a series out of the popular video game, then they should have titled the 2002 film as ""Resident Evil: Infection"".This film is amazing, and it deserves to be watched for Halloween.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hope is fading... Or is it?,"Never been much of a fan of the first two films (nor the video games), but this one I thought is somewhat an improvement in that it was entertaining and less showy. Thankyou. However I wouldn't make too much of it, when I still found it to be quite one-note with its plotting and covered with terribly conceived special effects. This one looks cheap, and it kinda shows in many aspects. What it concentrates is on its flashy style to storm up blistering action sequences and lets the expansive camera-work do its trick. The barren locations are well shot and the action is well handled without overplaying it. I wasn't so crazy about the erratic editing of the previous two ""Resident Evil"" films, but this one wasn't so bad and more often suitably focused. Some edgy, gripping and scorching set pieces do standout and the glum tone holds tight, but Paul W. Anderson's choppy story (which seems like a mixture of the first two movies) doesn't skip away from the basic one-tune to have much of a dent. Minimal post-apocalyptic b-grade nonsense with a standard script. The characters are so paper-thin, that they're never really annoy or gain your interest. To make matters worse the climax is pretty much a whimper. The performances are nothing special, and everyone goes by in a forgettable fashion. Well nearly everyone. Milla Jovovich's hell-bent turn is compelling, and Oded Fehr has a likable presence. Ali Larter is simply going throw the motions, and Ashanti is wasted but that's no complaint here. Russell Mulcahy's glossy direction stays snappy, and controlled. He throws in his fair share of cheap thrills, and the bloody make-up f/x are soundly executed. Some visuals do remind you of Romero's vastly superior ""Day of the Dead (1985)"". The soundtrack doesn't lend much of an impact, and the same can be said about the music score. Filled with flaws, but it works as enjoyable brainless fluff that keeps a fast-pace.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Wow.  RE:E was actually watchable...!,"RE:E is entertaining and quirky in the spirit of the first Resident Evil. Having been psychologically scarred for life by ""Ultraviolet,"" I for one was all too wary of placing credence on Milla's name alone as an indicator of a movie's quality. But, fortunately, RE:E comes through. It is decent. Hooray. I think what makes the Resident Evil franchise (the games and the films) successful in general is that it is inventive and interesting. While RE:2 may have had the largest budget of the series, it was bloated, plodding, and artistically threadbare. With RE:E, you have a more refined and engaging film experience without all the overpriced gimmicks. Yes, it could have been more, but, in terms of expectations and actual product, I felt RE:E was rather well done.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Very basic genre film that puts the absolute minimum of effort put into character, story, atmosphere and impact","The survivors of Racoon City have fled but the T-virus has moved quicker than anyone could have predicted and soon the entire world has fallen. Humans are not the only ones infected as all the creatures fall as well, destroying ecosystems and leaving little in their place. A small group of survivors travel across the Nevada desert, surviving one day at a time. This group is rescued by Alice, herself working on a plan to get to Alaska where isolation has supposedly protected an area form the T-virus  if only they can evade the infected to get there. This is not their only problem though, as the Umbrella Corporation is working on a treatment for the virus involving Alice's blood and, having located her, are setting out to capture her dead or alive.Approaching the Resident Evil series of films is a bit like living with an unreformed junkie, which is to say that, when you come home one day and all your stuff has gone then you are probably being naive if you're surprised. So with this third film I already had set my expectations pretty low because it is unfair to expect it to have changed since the other two films. Film three opens up the action into a world destroyed by the T-virus, with small groups of survivors fleeing Racoon City into the desert to live out a Mad Max style existence. It is also unfair to complain about this being ""unrealistic"" but I'm going to do it anyway but I'm going to do it within the context of the film. You see most films are not ""real"" situations but the important thing is to create a world that is convincing within the context of the story that you are telling  when you can't do that you leave the viewer on the outside from the very start.That is what happens here because the development of this world has gone no further than the pitch of ""the world is infected and small groups are surviving"" and it never really rings true. OK, so this is the first problem but if the rest of it works then maybe this won't matter. The next thing is the actual plot which, as before, has the potential in the shadowy masters of the world (a corporation with their own interests at heart) and the dangers of the infected. Sadly the plot again does little with these other than create a simple little event-driven story that allows for lots of gore and running. Again though, playing devil's advocate, that will be what the majority of people have come to the film for  gore and running. But guess what? Yup, I got another problem here.You see for me this film should achieve a lot with very little because I am a really easy target. I get easily scared and gripped by the zombie genre due to my fear of their base desire and unrelenting drive to satisfy that desire  even the Nazi Zombie sub-game in COD5 makes my skin crawl. However with Resident Evil 3 I found myself sitting there totally apathetic throughout. The effects were nice and some of the scenes were well conceived even if they were a bit derivative (the crows has a clear inspiration but is still a good sequence). What is missing though is a sense of real danger, a reason to care about the characters and a genuine sense of horror and fear  not gore, but fear. Without these what we have are bloody action sequences that concentrate on just delivering gore to satisfy those who have come for that and that alone. As such the film does do OK and might work as a Friday night DVD for young men staying in with friends and beer.The cast fit into this because the majority of them know that their roles are just part of genre cliché. Please form an orderly cue: the ethnic tick-boxes, the sexy young women, the one who gets secretly infected, the power-crazed scientist, the sacrificial hero, the non-threatening teen and so on. Jovovich does her usual stuff and prevents herself looking bored even though she has little to work with. Fehr is a rugged and good looking ""hero"". Ashanti is stunning. Larter is feisty. Glen is thoughtfully nuts. Epps is ""comedy"" relief and so on. It is not really an actor's film and it shows in their performances, which tick the genre boxes but nothing more.Resident Evil 3 is not much cop but it does rather depend on your point of view. If you are target audience and happy with the gore being the be all and end all of the film then it will probably do enough to satisfy. For the rest of us though the film is little more than a very basic genre film that ticks the boxes with the absolute minimum of effort put into character, story, atmosphere and impact.",,Anonymous,Horror
Staying on the road was the only way to stay alive,"**SPOILERS** A lot like the 1981 Mel Gibson apocalyptic auctioneer ""Road Warrior"" the movie ""Resident Evil: Extinction"" has to do with an experiment gone wrong; terribly wrong.Having mistakenly released the deadly T-Virus out of their main laboratory in Racoon City the Umbrella Cooperation is now trying to find an antidote to it in order to save the last few uninfected human survivors still left. One of the head honcho's of the UC Dr. Isaacs, Lain Glenn, is secretly experimenting with those infected by the T-Virus in order the make them obedient slaves to their masters, the cooperations, when and if a cure is found to keep, if not eradicate, the T-Virus in check.The key to finding a cure for the T-Virus is the now escaped head of security of the UC Alice, Milla Jouovich. Cloning scores of Alices' by Dr. Isaacs have all failed with them being killed, running through a deadly obstacle course, in trying to find out that their a perfect replication of Alice. It's the real Alice that Dr. Isaacs wants and to find her he'll use every means at his disposal to track her down even if it means going against the orders of his superiors at Umbrella Corps.Alice after a close and deadly encounter with a number of flesh-eating virus infected zombies and mutant wild dogs makes her way to this caravan of human survivors in the Nevada Desert. It was while Alice was out on her own she came across a booklet with transcribe radio transmissions from Alaska. The radio transmissions say that Alaska is the only place on earth that the T-Virus hasn't been able to penetrate. Giving this very vital information to the leader of the desert caravan Clair Redfield, Ali Larter, Alice has her decide to travel up north to finally get away from then tens of thousands of flesh eating zombies that roam the now almost totally deserted, of human beings, United States.Exciting run to daylight by the trucks cars and oil-tanker of the, what seems like, last human survivors of the continental US with tens of thousands of zombies either hot on their tail or in their face. Alice & Clair gets the convoy as far as Las Vegas where it ends up being stuck in five to ten feet of loose and shifting desert sands.Forced to make a stand the caravan survivors are almost wiped out by the rampaging and almost unstoppable zombies thirsting for their flesh since, from the looks of them, they haven't eaten in days. Alice saves the day by getting the few survivors out and then together with Carlos, Oden Fehr, runs the gantlet in smashing into the UC main headquarters and experiment center just outside of Vegas.With the remaining survivors safely put on one of the UC helicopters and out of harms way Alice makes her way into the heart of the experiment center. It's there that she finds out what Dr. Isaacs, who had morphed himself into an outer space alien-like monster, had planned to do to both her as well as himself to, in his own unique and insane way, single-handedly take over the world!The films confusing story is saved by its very effective and heart-stopping action scenes. Alice with her both super 9mm automatics and ferocious looking Gurkha bolo's, machetes, is more then a match for the hundreds of wild and screaming zombies that she has no trouble at all putting away. It's only later when Alice confronts the what seemed to be indestructible Dr. Isaacs, looking like the intergalactic stowaway monster in the movie ""Alien"", that she finds she has her hands full in trying to take him out.***SPOILERS**** It turns out that Alice has a friend that the megalomaniac Dr. Issac had completely overlooked in his attempt to both capture and, after he got what he wanted out of Alice, do her in. That friend not only rescues Alice but together with her help will not only put a stop to the rampaging T-Virus but the, what's left of them, top men of the UC; who's mad and self-serving experiments had created it in the first place.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Decent continuation to the RE series.,"This film I feel goes to extremes in areas, while on one hand it is extremely unlike the resident evil we all know, it is at times more like the games than the first two. Examples, the world has ended more or less and the Zombies have taken over the surface is very unlike the games, but the film is full of things from the games, but used subtly enough so as not to shove it in your face. The whole trapped obstacle course at the beginning screams the games (while the set is different the whole area rigged with deadly traps is very RE) The plot is driven forth by finding documents/notebooks again very RE and the Umbrella Lab looks brilliant, better than anything they designed in the games by far.Now for the plot, it was very simple, but then the film would have suffered from a very detailed plot, what was more important were the characters which were far superior to the previous films, and I suspect it has to do with Russel being appointed Director. Easily Anderson's best writing to date for characters although it's punch scenes seem to be a little less grand than the other films (the laser corridor in re and the nemesis shootout with the STARS in re:a) and the biggest disappointment was there were no monsters in the film apart from the staple Dogs and Zombies, the crows, while cool don't count and the Tyrant is only in it at the end. But that is more to do with budget than the script.The acting was far better in this film, and for once the supporting characters were well enough done for you to care about them or even just get a sense that they are real people in a bad situation. Unlike RE:A in which the main characters were planks and the support characters basically were just warm props.The action scenes were done very well, although at the beginning there is a little of the shot too close cut too fast syndrome but that evens out in the later scenes. The gore was good, not over the top like some rubbish zombie film but not as mild as the other RE films.The ending was a little off kilter, and lacked the big WHAM that Anderson usually ends the RE films with, I think less would have been more for this films ending, when you see it you will know what I mean.POSSIBLE SPOILERThe Tyrant was not too bad, but he didn't really grab me by the balls. I don't care if the Tyrant could still manage to talk a little, as after all he is still in the early stages of mutation but since the dialogue he did have was pretty cheesy and added nothing to the plot or film I think it could have been left out.Over all, I think it is a very good film, and I hope a 4th is in the works and they bring Russel back to direct.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

This Franchise is Beginning to Run Out of Gas,"This installment is ok. It is a shadow of the first two, but it is still fun. Alice is always fun to watch and she really begins to flex her supernatural muscles in this movie. The supporting cast does not have much to do. I think that the story doesn't do much to advance the Resident Evil worldbuilding, but it is still a good movie for fans of the game.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hardly goes anywhere,This one stands out for its post-apocalypse desert setting...... and that's really it. Everything else is just the same old generic action cookie cutter characters we'd expect by now. It doesn't help either that the plot really meanders especially in the middle. This was also probably the last one to have solid effort put into the production design cuz after this it's cinema catastrophes non stop.,4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Easily the best in the Resident Evil series,"This film was surprisingly watchable and I rate it the best in the Resident Evil series. The film carries on from where 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' stopped. The action is better staged and the VFX much better than the previous two films. There are some genuine scares and there's a chilling scene that works well as a homage to Hitchcock's 'The Birds'. Milla Jovovich has very few lines as always, but carries the film with her presence. The story is needlessly complicated and the climactic action sequences a letdown. Still watchable at least on television/DVD.Overall 6/10",,Anonymous,Horror
Could have been so much better,"The world is ravaged by the T-virus destroying nature itself. The world is drying up and the world is a desolate wasteland. Alice (Milla Jovovich) is roaming the world on her own keeping on the move. She battles zombies, bandits, and even crows. On the way, she joins a group of survivors (Ali Larter, Spencer Locke) reuniting with Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr). Meanwhile underground, Dr. Isaacs (Iain Glen) of Umbrella is doing research on clones of Alice.This is the third installment of the Resident Evil franchise. It is a vast improvement over the 2nd movie. The desolate look is superior. I love the post apocalyptic vibe. I wish they concentrated on only Alice on the road instead trying to keep track of the Umbrella storyline. There could be a great zombie road movie only if they allowed it to happen. Instead they keep interrupting it with Umbrella, and ruins any possibility of a fun zombie road trip.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Awesome action!,"The third installment in the resident evil franchise brings more zombie action and even bigger stunts for leading lady Alice. The plot takes place years after the second, which is a good choice, allowing new characters like Clair and K-Mart to be introduced. The storyline is well developed, the characters well acted, and the zombie action suitably amped up. Overall an enjoyable movie!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
more realistic and survivalistic than previous sequels,"I liked this sequel for being more about survival and very real, including its zombies, vehicles, nature. Unlike in previous sequels where there was more dark and indoor space, here we could see the landscape and daylight, and everything from all viewpoints like from air and distance. Also more human parts and less scifi parts. Hope to see next sequel. This movie will never be perfect because there are some too fake looking parts, and lacks more mystery and less action. But for its genre, it is perfect. Also nice that locations and story constantly change with each sequel. Except that, nothing special in comparison with previous sequels.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Objectively these films aren't great, but I can't stop watching!","If you're reading a review of the third instalment in this franchise, I'm going to assume you've seen the others, and if you've seen the first two and enjoyed them, there's absolutely no reason you won't enjoy this one too.I'd say its better than the second, but not quite as good as the first.Resident Evil: Extinction is solid with its story, its characters, and the action. Thankfully, the jarring cuts from the second film are gone (for the most part), making the action much more palatable and exciting.What I think this film does better than any of the others was the visuals. This is the best looking out of the first three films, with some great apocalyptic landscapes and good direction.The thing I really admire about the Resident Evil franchise is that they always leave you wanting more. I'm finding myself binge watching these as I'm intrigued to see where the story goes.An decent film in an enjoyable franchise!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sometimes you might wonder what the heck was that?,"Well first, Resident Evil is a good v-game series. Programmers and game developers made that series to be one of the scariest games ever made. And all that lean on psychological mood of horror, you'll never know what's behind that door.Resident Evil as a movie is... it is... well damn, i don't know! It's not horror, it's not pure action or even average action movie and you'll know after two minutes that Milla ain't gonna die. Or if she dies, she'll resurrect!

There is no story to it, the dialogue is poorly written, there are a few special effects that are descent. You get the idea that Mila's character is very powerful creature, but she only displays these powers two or three times. There are many plot errors in this movie (one day perhaps writers will learn to research what they are writing about as well as settings crew )I hope Mila will be able to survive what these movies may do to her career.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Sadly, it derails into the standard Alice vs Umbrella confrontation. It is well executed and a much better film than its predecessors, it just could have been even better (i.e. Actually good) if they had dared step out of the box with the story.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
More Mad Max with Zombies than Resident Evil,"The word ""extinction"" points to an end, the dying out of a species, the final full stop after a long story, usually coming after a series of disasters that drive home the finality of the situation. And what better way to do that to a movie franchise based on a video game than to totally disregard anything to do with the source material in favour of a clichéd mish mash of other well loved movies. We are in familiar post apocalyptic territory as the events of the previous RESIDENT EVIL APOCALYPSE has led to a global T-Virus outbreak which is implied to have caused lakes and rivers to dry out and the land itself to die, turning the whole continent into a barren desert. Las Vegas is covered to its buildings' rooftops in sand, zombies roam the land, cannibal gangs lie in wait for unsuspecting victims, survivors form convoys to stay alive and on the movie. Good golly, it's MAD MAX all over again and every other post apocalyptic movie ever.Some time has passed since the end of RESIDENT EVIL APOCALYPSE and the virus has spread, slowly killing the world and mutating its population. Alice, now cursed with psychic powers, wanders the desert of central USA searching for survivors. A convenient twist of fate puts her back together with former allies Carlos Olivera and L.J, along with new companion Claire Radfield and her convoy of survivors heading toward the ruins of Las Vegas. Meanwhile, the Umbrella Corporation is desperate to replicate the special powers that manifested in Alice, creating clones and putting them through conditions that replicated the events of the first RESIDENT EVIL movie. Another series of convenient twists put Alicia back on Umbrella's radar and head scientist Dr Issacs will stop at nothing to recapture his lost Super weapon.Ties to the video game are nearly non-existent here as we are throw into a rather generic post apocalyptic wasteland type of tale. The cast does their best with the material they were given but they never go beyond generic archetypes. It is hard to distinctly describe each character only because they are so bland. Newcomer Ali Carter barely resembles Claire Radfield from the video games. This is a major disappointment after how Sienna Miller perfectly portrayed the video games' Jill Valentine in live action. Which brings me to my other pet peeve: where's Jill? Where's the little girl from the previous movie? All this is never explained. Instead we are treated to a half hearted attempt at a character arc with Alice feeling more disconnected with her human feelings thanks to her growing powers. Some form of digital correction seems to have been applied to Milla Jovovich's face, giving this slightly off focus effect. Maybe it was meant to make her seem less human but it just serves to emphasise her lack of emotional range, keeping her stern stare and neutral expression looking even more artificial than usual.What makes up for all these short comings is the amazing production design and the action sequences. The costumes, vehicles and facilities are uniquely crafted and just screams ""badass"". And this movie sports some of the best looking action sequences courtesy of director Russel Mulcahy (of Highlander fame). His wide crane shots and sweeping cinematography make the otherwise generic fight scenes look a lot better than they should.With connection to the games all but severed, we could call this movie ""Alice in Zombie Land"" or ""Fight of the Limping Dead"" instead of ""Resident evil"". It is the best looking entry in the series with the best fight choreography and camera-work but Character development and motivations take a back seat to sweeping action pieces and one too many convenient twists.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than part two but thats faint praise,"The world really didn't need another Resident Evil movie, the previous outings where in no way great, indeed the second installment was for the most part god damn awful. This the third (and please studio execs final) in the series feels dull and very repetitive, the feeling of deja vu is prominent and seeing as the initial parts were pretty poor thats in no way a good thing. Milla Jovovich is the kind of actress who looks great but simply should quit and become a full time model. It's shocking how dodgy her performance is here, all wooden stares and wrist flicking knife action. The character was never sympathetic but Jovovich hasn't managed to inject any 3-D aspects into the character, which considering it's over three pictures is a bad show. I enjoyed some of the action, indeed one particular sequence which a the viewer will revel in, but altogether the director of Highlander brings the same bland tricks and turns we see in every video game movie, however the picture is pretty short ensuring it's game over pretty quick.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great sequel,"How many second sequels can you think of that hold up as well as the original or even the first sequel? RE: EXTINCTION does just that, thanks to a clever plot, fine performances from several seasoned actors plus some eye-popping special effects and set designs. A ragtag group of Raccoon City survivors is trying to find its way to a place of safety, and ends up crossing paths with Alice, who by now is so powerful she can actually control the elements. Meanwhile, the creeps back at the Umbrella Corp. are still after Alice, mainly for her blood. There are fights galore against an endless army of zombies, but the most amazing battle occurs between the survivors and thousands of zombie crows. For those old enough to remember Hitchcock's THE BIRDS, this confrontation plays out like that old classic on steroids. Oded Fehr from THE MUMMY movies and Ali Larter of the FINAL DESTINATION flicks are on hand as leaders of the caravan of survivors. Milla Jovovich is once again on hand as Alice, but there is reason to believe this will be her final performance in that role should yet another sequel get green-lighted. The end is a real kick in the head, by the way. The film has some awesomely gory moments and is not suitable for young children.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Anyway, I've quit after about 2/3 of it and I wish I haven't even started. It is yet another collection of bad horror clichés, preposterous actors and ridiculous stunts. Apparently the only person impressed by all that was the cameraman and maybe the editors, who altogether made it even more unwatchable.P.S. Looking at the number of 10's given to this movie my best guess is that all those miserable extras who played zombies are all registered on IMDb and obviously adore their own ""acting"".",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Substance exhilaration reduced,"Everyone was excited to see how well the third installment of Paul W.S. Anderson's (writer) Resident Evil will flaunt in theater's. I was as well anticipating seeing the movie in theater's as usual but decided to wait for it at original copies or clear, legal ripped movie on the net. Finally watching the film, I wasn't at all intensified with the flicks and twists it presented me for the first thirty minutes. Disappointing, to partially express a view for this, the third installment of Resident Evil wasn't that eye-catching, I guess the plot and acting didn't fit in, the story was quite lame to convince real scenery of an almost extinct post-apocalyptic world. The action scenes were also not that creative, but least to say so Milla Jovovich manage to preserve her character as isthe only gruesome I could acceptably identify were four: zombies ,dead K9s, infected crows and oh the sudden mutation of Dr. Isaac whom he consider himself the future he was always seeking rather than Alice herself. I also felt pity for those untimely sacrifices some characters gone, except for Carlos Oliveraand I knew that he and Alice had ""something"", I was glad but unsatisfied.Least to say so, it was still a considerable Resident Evil film sequel to follow what happened thereafter and apocalyptic disaster. But for me I appreciate the first two installments as more compelling. In this movie, I didn't felt the chills I usually had with the first two ones.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Enough is enough.,"First of all, let me just say that this movie is NOT Resident Evil. This is a different movie that uses the title ""Resident Evil"" in order to attract attention.I am a huge fan of the game. Being so, I went through the ""pain"" of going through the first two movies with the belief that I can finally get to see a REAL Resident Evil Character from the game coming into life. The first Resident Evil was forgivable. It was scary in almost all aspects and it didn't really rely much on those ""half-a-second"" screams where a zombie (or something else) suddenly pops out into the darkness and the music quickly gushes in high volume (this was really exploited poorly in Extinction. Cheap scare practice. Tsk tsk tsk). The second Resident Evil showed promise. It was ""almost"" good but the idea of a horror/thriller movie suddenly shifting into a butt-kicking, zombie-slashing action film is really disappointing and annoying - especially the part where ""Alice"" and ""The Nemesis"" end up doing a fist fight and The Nemesis technically showing emotion (Poor Nemesis. His reputation will forever be tarnished).Eventually, there came a third (and hopefully final) installment - Resident Evil: Extinction. Believe me when I say that the trailer looks better than the movie. The trailer ignited a ""hype"". But the movie really didn't deliver much.Besides the traditional ""half-a-second"" scares, the movie heavily moves in an eccentric manner: First, the characters say their poor lines. Second, they then enter a deserted place - a deserted DARK place. Third, everything seems quiet. Too quiet. Fourth, a ""half-a-second"" scare takes place (usually a zombie appearing suddenly, a rat making some noise, or the wind blowing). Fifth, ACTION! I think this sequence happened at least three times or more within the movie's 90-minute lifespan.As usual, it was Milla Jovovich who saved the movie. Her wide array of action moves was truly a lot of fun (and knowing for a fact that she does her own stunts makes it even more fun). Even though the character Alice never really existed in the games, Milla's portrayal of the character made it seem worth it. And I am not talking about the nude scenes.Poor writing, mediocre script, badly portrayed characters (except Alice), typical horror/action elements and ultra-obvious (okay, not that obvious) CGI effects makes this movie a VERY POOR adaptation. I wonder how the creators of Resident Evil feels.Oh wait. Adaptation? I forgot. This isn't Resident Evil. This is a different movie. The last minutes of the film made it clear that it is different. Being that it is different, I'd recommend to the entire crew that they should have named it ""PROJECT ALICE"" instead. Or ""DESERT WORLD"". Or ""I am a man who got bitten by a zombie and I won't tell anyone so that I can attack the person next to me a few hours later when I become a zombie"".Watch it or not? You're choice. If you're not a fan and have never played the games (or even read or researched about it), then you won't feel a hint of anger and disappointment over the film's writer and director. You'll probably enjoy this - one way or another. BUT if you're a fan of the games and are aware of all game's elements, then do not even bother with this film. My God. Let's all just wish that in the next decade, a TRUE fan of the game will make a movie that will blow the previous installments into oblivion.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""We do love a challenge!""","Resident Evil: Extinction is now the third installation in the series and so far it's the best! I saw this in the theater last night and I can't tell you when the last time was that I was genuinely excited to see scene after scene. I think Resident Evil: Extinction is my favorite in the series so far, it had great action, horrifying scares, and an actual story that could send chills down your spine. Milla is still kicking butt and she is so awesome in this film, not to mention that her telekinetic powers are growing stronger, so she's becoming a much more advanced fighter against the living dead. Resident Evil: Extinction is everything you could hope for: action, horror, a little romance, science fiction, and drama. The story was terrific because who knows how far we are from screwing up and possibly destroying the world? Scary to think about it.Basically the entire world is now a desert, most of the world's population is dead from the virus that is making them into the living dead. Most of the survivors are using the roads for survival and trying to kill as many of these zombies as they can while looking for food, water, and a safe place to live. Alice comes across a group and stays with them to help them out and she's back with Carlos once again. While it seems they are in the clear and safe, it turns out that Alice is being watched by Umbrella and they want her blood to create super zombies with incredible strength. They've been cloning her to see if they can get some close enough to her capability, but when Alice finds out about this, they may wanna rethink their plan.The only thing I regret about getting into the Resident Evil films is now I have to wait for the next sequel! LOL, it's just like a TV series, you can't wait until the next episode because the previous one had such a great ending. Oh, well, I knew what I was getting into. Resident Evil: Extinction is one heck of an awesome film and I highly recommend that you go see it, especially if you've seen the previous two films.

Why Do Zombies Make the Lights Flicker?,"I went to see this with little expectations. It is, after all, Resident Evil. From the trailer, they make it look like there will be some crazy Zombie action in Vegas. No. Don't believe it. Little use is made of Vegas at all. No, that might have made an interesting setting. And since the Resident Evil makers want to stick to their ""We Shall Make Sucky Films"" policy, the majority of the film is set in a sprawling desert, sometimes flowing with sand and sometimes composed entirely of CG.The special effects are decent, but the incredible lack of story. It was like they were holding back every time the script started to get exciting. An hour into the movie I was crushing popcorn on the littered floor to amuse myself.The ending was extremely anti-climactic. You spend the entire movie watching your heroine kick zombies to high heaven and then the final battle was ridiculously lame. Not to mention that somehow, a single zombie managed to paint all the walls with dripping blood. Gallons and gallons of blood were all over every wall. It looked like the scene of a Dick Cheney hunting excursion.I will probably never see this movie again. It definitely wasn't any good, and it wasn't horrible enough to amuse me.

A daily comment from Midget Emma: Resident Evil: Extinction (2007),"A big improvement over Apocalypse. Another Resident Evil movie has hit the world and just like the first two it is average. It is more of the same with little changes. Maybe it is time for the Resident Evil movies to have a big makeover or become extinct.This time we are in the desert and like last time we are following some survivors. Same story basically. They have just added a new zombie, gave Alice new powers and put us in the desert. This doesn't get past much people. I am talking to you Resident evil writers. It feels like someone sat there and said "" It would look cool if we done that"".Some things that really annoy me is the zombies. We see them ripping cars apart but they can't push down an everyday fence. Another thing they pay way to much attention to Alice. Whether your watching her spinning swords around or watching her jump slow motion through the air. It is a waste of time and this movie only goes for an hour and half already.There are some good things. There are some eye catching environments and 1 or 2 jump scares but thats it. It seems the series can't catch up with the good zombie movies. An average movie.Only see this if you have seen the first two.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
All bets are off,"The first movie Resident Evil (2002) was not that bad of a start for being based on the popular games, with the sequel Resident Evil: Apocalypse (2004) it was more similar the third game but was losing its focus on horror survival and focused more on action, which was disappointing; with this third film we have another change in directors, and it is slowly becoming less like the games it is based on. The third film Resident Evil: Extinction (2007) has bland or annoying performances, bad CGI effects and occasional subtle uses of practical effects, a stereotypical bad person that is part of Umbrella, bad action scenes, and quite a few dumb things involved in the plot; plus, the location being North America becoming some kind of desert wasteland because of the T-Virus was just the movie making up what the virus can do, when the virus infecting people and animals on the cellular level was good enough, so having it randomly effect most of the land in North America just felt like some kind of plot device or something they made up to make the movie happen.Once again, Alice is still played fine by Milla Jovovich who needed more in her performance because I did not care about her that much, and I still do not understand the progression from someone who does not know that many things to all knowing action; she knows she is being controlled by Umbrella, so she tries to stay off the grid, but also she puts herself and the other characters in danger despite knowing that. A main character from the games put into this film is Claire Redfield played blandly by Ali Larter, sort of looks like the character from the games but is not given much characterization that explains who she is, why she is here, and why/how she knows the main characters from the previous films; she was introduced out of nowhere, and she does not do much, except trying to save the people she is grouped together with in many difficult situations. Lastly, any other characters are disposable people to get killed off by zombies or mutated people, except for one other character from the earlier film, who does not do that much and gives little to nothing that could make you care about him.The antagonist is this guy Dr. Issacs from Umbrella who is controlling Alice with him seeing her in action learning her new abilities and doing a bad job keeping his distance from her, but also, he does the dumbest thing by trying to domesticate the zombies to do his bidding while also using Alice's blood; there is an antagonist from the games put into this film, he does not do much except lead the Umbrella Corporation, but he was mostly just there to be a tease for the films after this. The action sequences can look over the top with there being cuts that can occasionally make it hard to tell what is currently happening, along with mediocre CGI for the mutated monsters, that makes these unintentionally funny; there are also quite a few times where the editing could have been better, moments that can be stupid in execution, and uses of obvious green screen. Lastly, there can be scenes that make no sense with characters doing the opposite of what they are supposed to be doing, and there needed to be mor of an explanation on why certain scenes happened when they did.The film Resident Evil: Extinction (2007) has bland or annoying performances, bad CGI effects and occasional subtle uses of practical effects, a stereotypical bad person that is part of Umbrella, bad action scenes, and quite a few dumb things involved in the plot; plus, the desert wasteland made the movie feel less like a horror survival movie, and more like an apocalyptic movie. Lastly, I will say that I did not like this third film, it did not feel like a horror survival movie anymore, much like the fifth and sixth installment in the video game series, and it was funny in an entertainingly bad way; if you enjoyed the first film and the second one, you might not like this third film, but as a fan of the games, I would not recommend watching this movie.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Personal Review,"I think , as a Resident Evil fan , that this movie is really the best approach to the franchise. The tension in some scenes are really awesome, the character's searching rooms, finding clues and things, shattered rooms with electric cables hanging , sparkling , i mean , this is Resident Evil! The action is intense, but not stupidly intense as in the 2nd movie, it takes place when it has and not all the time. The constant running for their lives, makes it a really great survival horror movie. Speaking of characters, i think Alice finally evolved to something else, she has power , but she doesn't make an excessive use of it, she's not a super-action-Kong-foo fighter 24H/day anymore. I'm a bit disappointed with Wesker, as a player , i thought he had a different role, i am mostly mad about the fact that his role has not been respected, but this is a movie, glad that they didn't turn him in a good guy ( Nemesis ??). In order to conclude, the movie could've had a different name, with different character's , because it isn't 100% related to the game, except for the names used in it, but it's a great movie, can't wait for a Collector's edition DVD!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fantastic Stuff - but a little short on story ...,"There is nothing that I didn't like about this movie except that it didn't feel like a complete story - more like a small part of a larger story. Outside of that, the visuals were great, the characters were interesting and the action was non-stop.Here's the setup of the Resident Evil movies:Resident Evil: A virus that transforms people into zombies is released in an underground research facility and infects the workers.Resident Evil: Apocalypse: The virus has now escaped and infected the inhabitants of the city above the research facility.Resident Evil: Extinction: The virus has now escaped the city and infected the world.Furthermore, the somewhat amoral corporation (the same one responsible for the virus in the first place) is working on a cure. The key lies in getting the original blood of Milla Jovovich's character ... and the story progresses from there.While the setup sounds interesting, the actual story told is too short. Too much time is spent on human vs. zombie fights. While they are well done, the plot doesn't get time to advance much ... and doesn't.It's too bad, because the visuals effects, characters and pacing are really well done. In fact, the visuals of the decaying desert-like surface juxtaposed with the few high-tech underground facilities left in the world are particularly interesting to watch. All of these aspects deserve a much more significant story.But it is what it is ... and it's still worth watching for anyone who really likes the previous Resident Evil movies.

uh oh,"I'm not too sure what happened with this movie but I don't think it was as good as the first one, and was equally as 'weird' as the 2nd. I do think that this trilogy is an example of what happens when a director takes on a project and another director tries to do a sequel to it.It's the same story with the 2 remakes of The Hills Have Eyes. In that case the guy who did the first apparently backed out of the 2nd one. In the case of Resident Evil, it's pretty much the same story. Paul WS Anderson did a pretty good job of the 1st movie, but the 2nd, directed by someone else, wasn't nearly as entertaining.This one, the 3rd installment, proved to be borderline disaster, especially with some of the dialog, was bad at times, survived only by a few good scenes (death scene near the end with the red lasers). I also noticed that the 3rd one took a few scenes from the original, and I'm not too sure if I liked that.Milla Jovovich looked stunning as normal, but now I am hoping she can talk Paul WS Anderson into coming back for the 4th. I really liked the last death in the movie where the zombie was sliced by the intertwined lasers but that was one of the few bright spots. I really think that to make Resident Evil Degeneration any better, you need the movies' original director, Paul WS Anderson. The other thing I liked about it is the last couple camera shots tell you there is going to be a 4th.I find it hard not to get hooked on the story, though.

"""Mankind faces extinction"" is the tagline for the movie but I was hoping it would say the movie series would face extinction!","I've now watched Resident Evil and Resident Evil: Apocalypse which were both good movies in their own way. Resident Evil: Extinction, however, is the odd one out in the series as this isn't even remotely good. Resident Evil heroine Alice, along with a group of survivors from Raccoon City, attempt to travel across the desert wilderness to Alaska to escape a zombie apocalypse.The story lacks a lot of everything, I could even go so far to say that there is no story at all as it is yet again pretty much the same as its last two movies. It has nothing to do with the games whatsoever so Resident Evil gamers will definitely find this movie disappointing. There were one or two great action sequences which kept you awake such as the fight in Las Vegas and the crows but otherwise it is yet again to impress the younger audience. The last two had something to do with the games but this one didn't, it just threw references at you just to remind you that the movie is Resident Evil such as Claire Redfield, Albert Wesker and the Tyrant from the first Resident Evil game.The acting was above average except for Milla Jovovich who managed to brighten up this dull and boring movie a little. Ali Larter who played Claire Redfield was average as was the rest of the cast. There are so many problems with this movie but one of the main problems is that you couldn't care for the characters at all, not even for Alice. Resident Evil: Extinction has made a silly twist to the story of the movie series and has an even sillier ending. The start of the movie was surprisingly promising but in the end, disappointed. Everything about the movie could have been improved, even the make-up and design for the zombies but the worst case for this is the Tyrant near the end of the movie, it wasn't anywhere near scary or believable.Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not as good as the first two.,"I was very hyped for the release of this film, especially as i enjoyed the first 2 so much, and have played the computer games. Also i like Milla Jovovich a lot easily the best Female Action Superstar around today, she can kick Ar"""". Very sexy and hugely enjoyable for all the boys. She's made a big impact on the action flick scene, and raised expectations for all future flicks, it's gone of the days where action men dominated the movie scene, we now want to see hot chicks with guns, and major cool action stunts and Milla always delivers, you want more and more. This movie does have it's high points and continues the story from the first 2 films, which is good, and often takes you back to the first and second films, the film has evolved from much more than just a zombie horror flick it has become a series like the games, and has been left wide open for a 4th because more needs to be answered, and I'm dying to see what the creators come up with next. And yes we do get a lot of blood, a lot of guns, a lot of zombies with more dogs and crows!!!! it was nice to see the cast from the second film return. I don't have anything that bad to say about it really just didn't quite reach the mark the second did, but still highly enjoyable. It was nice to see Ali Larter from Final Destination, i find she looks a lot like Milla, and before now got them both mixed up. I feel they could've used Ali more, but most likely didn't want to take the shine off Milla, not that you could! these films are her own.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
It's all about Milla...,"Like I already said: It's all about Milla. If you like her, you'll like all three parts of Resident Evil trilogy.First of all, I'm not Resident Evil games fan. I never played any of these games, but I really like the whole Resident Evil movie trilogy. I admit, it's more or less because of good looking and in every scene sexy Milla. The same thing was with Underworld and Kate Beckinsale.Bunch of people say Milla isn't any good as an actress. Well I don't agree with that. She was great in the movies No Good Deed, Dazed and Confused, Dummy (and of course Res. Evil) and is the main reason why so many people watched these movies. I believe that the true reason why so many people don't like her is because she isn't ambitious like, let's say, Brad Pitt, Leonardo di Caprio, Keira Knightley etc. She is, in one hand, synonym for B-movies, but Jason Statham and lot's of other good actors are too. So does that makes them a bad actors? No, it doesn't. They just act in the movies where they know they can be good and that is the main reason why I respect them so much. They don't aim too high, so they never end up short like some other ""great"" actors.So, if you are looking for some movie with good - looking actress, very good action and lot's of fun, I believe you should watch the whole trilogy. Just take the movies for what they really are, relax and enjoy it. Like someone already said, it's a perfect popcorn trilogy.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Even if the movie is only for entertainment purposes, it's still too normal","The background of the movie is quite interesting. I quite like the desert survival wars. I have watched this movie several times. It's quite interesting in a few ways. But that is not enough to make the film have depth. The action characters are quite absurd and goofy. The final fight also happened too quickly and was not interesting. Anyway, this is a movie adapted from a game so maybe I shouldn't have high expectations.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Fresh Start for the Series in a Way,"I believe that RE3 really has many good aspects going for it. I mean this one took the cake, and it showed it's true colors. It developed on little plot lines that were confusing in the 2nd film, it gave us some excellent characters again and it look upon developing the location even more this time by making every extinct: using a deserted area, along with the infected now being zombies, re-animated.The plot is still the same really, the Alice characters is roaming around, gets into trouble, escapes and then finds a group of survivors taking camp in the middle of nowhere. She decides to team up with two characters seen in the previous installment, along with some new characters. I believe this sequel is a tad better than the 2nd film, because the atmosphere of the film I feel is more scarier and creepier.Instead of taking a more modern tone like RE2 did, RE3 goes for a very isolated, deserted, scary feel where the dead become more brutal, the characters must be more smarter and the addition of the crows which was a creepy touch. The music as always was also good and Dr. Isaacs as that creature was pretty insane.I think RE3 is definitely a worthy sequel, and works on many levels. I also found it a tad better than the 2nd film because it's plot lines were less confusing. But it's installment 3, and in RE, it's all about the action-packed violence which is all good fun.I would give this undeniably bloody sequel a 7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Disappointing, But Necessary Viewing For Fans Of The Franchise","I just finished watching this movie on DVD. I am a fan of the Resident Evil franchise and had been delighted with it's quirky take on the horror niche zombie genre. I won't bore the reader with a recap of the plot line. If your reading the comments here, you have an idea of what the franchise is about and where this film is probably going. So, I'll just cut to the chase. Resident Evil: Extinction is a disappointing third film in the Resident Evil franchise. I won't say trilogy, because there is an opening for another installment. So I would say watch this film so that you are up to speed in the inevitable fourth film. Just don't expect the fun of the first Resident Evil.I have to say watching the increasing regression in quality of this franchise has been a disappointment.I remember seeing Mila Jovovich and Paul W.S. Anderson at a Fangoria convention plugging the first Resident Evil to a very bored and jaded audience who had long ago gotten tired of every filmmaker insisting their project was a totally new type of horror film. When I finally got to see the movie in the theater I was pleasantly surprised to see that Resident Evil was indeed a breath of fresh air in the horror genre.What I think went wrong with the franchise is that once the studio executives discovered they had lightening in a bottle with the first Resident Evil, everyone now put their grubby fingers in the creative process and mucked the whole works up. Resident Evil: Extinction probably is the victim of too many film executives trying to put their stamp on this film and here is the result.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Humanity has reached a new low...,"There are statements people can make that instantly tell you everything you need to know about them. When Albert Einstein stated that the simple version of relativity was akin to how quickly time moved in different situations, for example, it told the world they were dealing with an intelligence too great to be easily understood. So when a person tells you that Resident Evil: Extinction is a good film, you instantly know that they are a grade A moron who is best swiftly removed from the gene pool. And it is not like the filmmakers failed to try this time. After the exercise in failure to deliver that the previous sequel turned into, this installment simply had to get better by comparison. The unfortunate downside to this being that a lot of mouth-breathers who have obviously never seen a Romero or Fulci film have the unfortunate habit of confusing ""better"" with ""good"". Websites dedicated to the savoring of bad films will tell you that a film is in trouble when it starts to remind you of better ones. RE:E takes less than four minutes to remind viewers of the substantially better original.By now, we know better than to go to a Resident Evil film expecting anything like good acting or a well-told story. But what separates the first film from its sequels is a little quality called atmosphere. Simply put, the look, the feel, the music, and even some of the performances, were ""right"". Resident Evil took the time to suspend the viewer's disbelief and draw them into its world. The sequels absolutely fail at this deceptively simple step because they take it for granted that the viewer has been drawn in. This becomes painfully obvious when voiceovers describe how the T-virus has somehow dried up the oceans or other such rot. No matter how lethal and easily transmissible a virus can be, one that destroys the environment that it is meant to thrive in is not well-equipped for long-term survival. But since we are meant to accept this virus as being able to instantly adapt to whatever needs the plot requires, we also accept that making sense is not high on the list of priorities the filmmakers have.If only the film having a voice of its own was a higher priority to these filmmakers. As said previously, RE:E wastes no time in reminding the viewers of better films. Aside from the original in the series, RE:E also attempts to steal from not one, not two, but three George Romero films, all from the same series. Say what you will about Day Of The Dead especially, but Day Of The Dead's subplot about attempts to domesticate the zombies made an interesting metaphor for the intolerance human society was and is developing for natural behaviour that does not meet the expected norm. In RE:E, this subplot is handled with such clumsy focus on attempting to move the plot forward by any means necessary that any social commentary is lost in the disbelief at how inept the storytellers seem. The concept of parties raiding old towns for supplies is also about as original as a third-generation fax, but it is done so badly here that it truly makes one appreciate how Land Of The Dead negated questions about what the heroes are going to do when the leftovers run out.And even if RE:E fails to remind one of much better films, the philosophy that less is more completely and utterly backfires. One reason the Resident Evil sequels remind this viewer a lot of Romero's Dead series is because Romero's Dead series allocated sufficient time to explore enough of the characters that their plight and struggles seemed real and compelling. The manner in which the shopping mall environment slowly evolves from a safe paradise to a prison is very palpable due to the acting in Dawn Of The Dead. The real Dawn Of The Dead, I mean. When you see Omar Epps return for another performance in RE:E, all the toning down of the bling bling act in the world cannot help but bring back memories of his performance in the previous film. Which in turn leaves audiences who can read and speak at an adult level wishing to see his character die a gruesome and horrid death. While RE:E is not quite as softcore as its immediate predecessor, its seemingly unending ability to leave the viewer wanting more is a stark contrast to how Dead films can make even the most hardcore viewer wonder if they are perhaps going too far.All this leaves one wondering exactly what Capcom think of how these second-tier studio gatherings have used their property. The first film in the series at least had a freaky sense of atmosphere and some replications of game conventions to tie it to its source material. If you changed the titles of the two sequels and removed all references to the Umbrella corporation, they would be unrecognisable as connected to Capcom's games. Simply put, the Resident Evil title is nothing more than a transparent ploy to fanboys and video game addicts to pay for films that are increasingly poorly-written. If truth in advertising laws were more stringent, they would be required to be titled something along the lines of We Have No Respect For You At All, Videogamers: Just Give Us Your Money. The saddest part of it is that this kind of corporate shill film designed to whip consumers into a money-shedding frenzy is exactly what previous, far superior works such as (the real) Dawn Of The Dead were trying to warn us about.Resident Evil: Extinction is a film so bad that it makes misfires like Day Of The Dead seem like Zwartboek by comparison. It is a two out of ten film in every sense: too bad to be worthwhile, not bad enough to be entertaining. Avoid.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hey I liked it!!,"First off let me say this, ""I really liked the film!"" I have read a quite a few reviews of this film, and some of them were positive a lot of them were negative. Some people were poking holes in the plot of the story, credibility, the acting, the writing, the directing, etc. Let me tell you something you find your favorite critically acclaimed Oscar film.You look at every single possible angle, really put every scene under a microscope you are bound to find mistakes. Also when one does this, does it not take away some of the joy of sitting back and watching a movie?Next I will say is this ""People lighten up; the film does not take itself so seriously why should you? Have you seen other zombie films? I have. Have you ever wonder about the depth of characters? Especially the supporting cast? The answers to these questions should be no. I mean you and I both know they are going to get it. The whole point to going to movies like this is to suspend one's own disbelief and to let your mind be entertained. I mean that is why so many of use read comic books, futuristic novels, about science, space travel,horror etc. Also to people who have said oh it rips of that movie, or that! Here's some food for thought, the writer himself has said that he wanted to pay a tribute to movies like Mad Max that inspired him, but put his own updated twist on it. What's wrong with that?...Nothing! Hell creative play writes have been doing this for a couple hundred years with Shakespeare. Not that I am implying the Anderson is any were near the same league as good old Billy Shakespeare. But if something inspires you, you may want to put your own twist and stamp on it.""

Alice's Fight Continues In This Decent Sequel,"In this 3rd installment of the Resident Evil series, we find that the T-Virus has spread out from Raccoon City at an alarming rate and has infected practically the whole of mankind. Alice continues her fight against the Umbrella Corporation and has now reached the baron deserts of Nevada where she joins up with a small band of survivors. Acting on information that the T-Virus hasn't reached Alaska, they all decide to take a chance and make the distant journey. However, Alice still has the Umbrella Corporation in her sights, so she now has to make a decision on whether to stay with her new friends, or continue her fight against Umbrella.I think it's pretty safe to say the film adaptations of the Resident Evil games have taken on a whole new self perspective as they don't really have anything to do with the game series now. Yes there's the Umbrella Corporation, the T-Virus, the zombies, but that's about it really. That's not a complaint, though - just a mere observation, because this is still a decent film and if you go into it just to watch it for what it's supposed to be, then you shouldn't really be too disappointed.Like the 2nd film, the story obviously isn't the main ingredient and it's the action that keeps it going, but in saying that I did feel that there was more of a developing story than what was in Apocalypse, but not by much. But let's be real here - we don't watch this type of movie for the riveting plot & gripping story lines...we watch them for the action and like I say, the action & visuals that are in the film is good enough to keep you entertained.Another thing I like about this movie is that it does continue the story (even if it is thin). It's not a sequel that has absolutely no bearing on the previous movie(s) and just uses the film name. You can watch it as a stand-alone film, but you'll not really have much idea what's going on so it's best watching the previous movies 1st.Definitely worth a watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
It really is the end of the world.,"Sometimes you can nitpick a movie to death and not really say anything useful. I particularly am distressed when one compares a movie to a book or a video game. A movie may be based on a book or movie, but it stands alone.I watch some movies for intellectual stimulation, some for physical stimulation, some just to have a good laugh, and some just to be entertained without a lot of effort on my part. This movie fits that last motive perfectly.It's sole purpose is to entertain and it did that well. There really wasn't a lot of story here; just enough to frame the battles with the zombies and those freaking birds!

Alice in Zombieland,"Resident Evil: Extinction is number three in the franchise. The world is even more bleak and the infection is hyper-pandemic proportions. Alice (Milla Jovovich) is surviving off the grid and the Umbrella Corporation is still performing clandestine experiments and operations.I just saw a trailer for the latest Resident Evil which prompted me to freshen up on the franchise. I also just saw Kate Beckinsale as Selene in Underworld: Blood Wars and she is a hard act to follow. Alice is nice. She's skilled, strong and a major badass in her own right but Selene is a notch above.Besides the Selene/Alice comparison, I think I'm suffering from zombie fatigue. I've seen countless zombie movies and what... seven seasons of ""The Walking Dead""? I still like the zombie genre but the ""Resident Evil"" zombies are too strong and fast for my liking (not too mention the fact they were climbing structures as well). Besides Alice's new found abilities there was nothing to really distinguish this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Extinction of the series,"POSSIBLE SPOILERSI usually write about films that really stand out to me, good or bad. I wouldn't usually write about big releases as hundreds do that but I had to throw my pennies worth in on this.I like the RE games, not an avid fan but do enjoy them. I've seen the other 2 RE films and whilst disappointed that they turned into just action flicks, take them for what they are. After all, it's Paul WS Anderson who got his mitts on them. Mortal Kombat was fun, RE1 & 2 were fun and kept nice elements from the game. AVP....urgh.All those people saying 'Wow, this was great' or 'Such a roller coaster of action' or 'Best RE film' are missing the point. If this was a stand alone film then maybe, yeah, bit of mindless action to keep you going....but it's not. It's part of a series and it's not stayed within the same vein as the first 2 films. This is why I for one was rather bored as I watched this.Gone are the elements from the first 2 that relate to the games. Gone is any form of character development (I know there wasn't lots in the first 2 but there was some). Gone (and I felt the most important) is the dark element from the first 2. Yes, I do mean as in lighting but more so that sense of hopeless foreboding. After all, these films are zombie films and any good zombie film has that underlying hopelessness as let's face it, a zombie outbreak begins....you're pretty screwed once it's out no matter what you do.Bravo to Mr Anderson for actually wanting to have more daytime settings this time around but it just didn't work.....and what's with the virus making everything baron wasteland? It's dull to look at. there is one city shot near the end and this is what I wanted more of. Where was the harm in continuing the story from where number 2 left off?What we end up with is the makers of the film saying 'you know the premise, we're just going to try and dazzle you with action set pieces and hope you're all in your teens in order not to notice that all we've done is make a poor film but robbed you of the entrance fee'I'm not in my teens and therefore not fooled. They still managed to fail in the action areas for so many reasons.Paul WS Andreson said after the first film he would like to make a trilogy. He should have stuck to that and used this as the opportunity to find a fine balance between the first 2 films to have the series go out on a bang....but he didn't and now we are faced with the prospect of a 4th film.PS To the guy who did the mock up conversation of Paul and the studio...excellent.

"Resident Evil: Extinction is more of the same ,with impressive action sequences","Milla Jovovich reprises her tough-girl-in-sexy-thigh-boots role, and the survivors travel in Mad Max conveys up and down desert highways in search of fuel. Zombie sequel is just as grisly as the first two. Director Russell Mulcahy is revered by genre fans for his work on the original Highlander, he will gain many more followers inside Fangoria circles with this over-the-top splatter fest. The action at times is pretty effective, from an attack by an infected flock of crows, to some brutal fighting in a sand-engulfed Las Vegas. Aussie filmmaker Russell Mulcahy piles on the atmosphere to make up for lack of originality in the script or production design. He also knows which bones to throw zombie movie fans, who relish the methodology of destroying the slow moving freaks.A grimly efficient horror thriller that delivers exactly what the other two entries did: monsters, gore, and a heavily armed Milla Jovovich in boots and garters.Equal parts Mad Max and Day of the Dead, this third and supposedly final entry in the Resident Evil franchise is no less derivative than its predecessors but moves along at a brisk clip.With clever lifts from ""The Birds"" and Cormac McCarthy's bleak ""The Road,"" you have a rare movie that wasn't screened for critics yet is actually worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Still good for a third sequel,"I was quite impressed with this movie since it was the third sequel. It is still actually entertaining and good and the plot moves forward. One negative for me was the ending. It's set up for the next film with several hundred Alice's ready to kick Umbrella's arse. In this movie, it has been years since the T virus infected Raccoon City and it has spread wiping out the population and turning the land into a desert. Alice is traveling by herself avoiding Umbrella's spies. We also find out that Alice has mental powers now. Due to no transportation, she must join up with a caravan and convinces them that they should try to go to Alaska, where infection may not have spread yet. Only problem is they must look for fuel in Vegas.During this time Umbrella has tracked Alice and has a surprise waiting in Vegas. But the evil scientist gets bit in Vegas and injects lots of antivirus and the effects turn out pretty devastating. Alice decides they must get Umbrella's helicopter to get to Alaska and comes up with a plan. The remaining survivors get on the copter while Alice goes underground to take care of Umbrella.One problem I had was how could the zombies climb Eifel Tower yet thousands of them couldn't climb or knock down a wire fence. Also, when alice busts the fence down, she takes her sweet time in going down below. How come the zombies aren't running after her since the fence has a hole in it.The special effects were pretty good and the plot was interesting. It just wasn't a repeat of the previous films. And I liked the opening when I'm like isn't this the first film? And the way the mutant scientist dies after bragging I can't be killed was good.FINAL VERDICT: If you liked the first two, you will want to see this one. And with the ending, they have to make a fourth film.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Ordinary action based movie without anything else to enjoy.IMDb rating is far too high for Resident Evil:Extinction.

better than part 2,"W hat a great opening this flick has, it takes you back to the ending of part 2 and the start of part 1. It picks up exactly when Alice (Milla Jovovich) breaks free of a new experiment being hold on her body but it also takes you back to the original Resident Evil when Alice wakes up in the shower.Finally the effects were much better than Resident Evil, here they went back to real effects and less CGI although CGI is still an important part in Extinction. Also this time things are seen on-screen instead of being done off-camera.I wont go into the story itself because Alice has new abilities and is confronted by...Alice. Further she a loner in a world gone by but when a weird dream happens she has to join another group. Together they're of to destroy the Umbrella company and of to Alaska, were there is no infection.I liked it because I just watched the previous parts otherwise you wont understand all what's going on.

Hotties vs evil corp in zombieland,"In a major character development, Alice eventually learns that she would have an advantage in a zombie crisis if she dressed a little more protectively in the time between the previous movie and this one. She's still wearing a post-apocalyptic garter, but that's okay, there's progress.Jokes aside, the dose of fan service has been toned down considerably and something close to a Mad Max style action movie with a zombie apocalypse has been shot. Still very popcorn movie though.The final boss fight, which they screwed up with CG in the first movie but was relatively not bad in the second movie, is quite anticlimatic in this movie. It comes to an end in a very short time and does not offer much in terms of choreography. But apart from the boss fight, there is the pleasure of watching the action-packed fight of the survivors and a now completely superheroic Alice against zombies.I find it enjoyable that they took the series in a relatively planned manner, moving from the laboratory scale in the first movie to the city scale in the second movie, and moving to the world scale in this movie.As they do in every movie, they didn't forget to figure out where to take the subject in the next movie. The fact that they confidently shoot each film as if it were a series episode, as if the next one will come, makes me feel that there is a solid support behind them, both in terms of audience and production costs, even if the ratings of the film do not seem good.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pretty faces and zombies.,"I must say i wasn't expecting i would rate it a 7. Not after the mindless Apocalypse. Well, RE Extinction does not offer a brilliant storyline or great acting. But presents us with some good twists.REE doesn't look like a movie per se. Actually, after you watch it, you get he sensation it is just a halfway to the fourth RE. It makes you want to watch its sequel right when you finish this one.Lets start with its issues: Too many beautiful people. Thats one of the reasons i liked Walking Dead. Why does all the characters must be pretty? what sense does it make? Is it really gonna attract more viewers? Nop. Pure bullshit. Pretty faces and organized hairs are the last matter in a post apocalyptic world. Its stupid to put it as a priority when choosing actors. So what happens is now we have half of the cast formed by poor actors, at least they're pretty and dress fashionably.Now, the Pros: AMAAAAAAAANZING SOUNDTRACK. I can compare this soundtrack with Transformers. Amazing and really well made sound effects pulls you inside the movie. And this is the best part of the whole thing. I'm really impressed, because its even better than first and second RE.Action scenes were better produced, along with zombies make up, what is probably because of technologies improvement. They have made a highly entertaining zombie action movie, even if it is not a brilliant film, has some power to catch our attention.Good to watch eating something caloric if ur looking for a mind relaxation.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
90 minute advert,"Woeful third instalment in the movie-based-on-the-game series. Plotwise (what little there is) steals shamefully from Romero, especially Day of the Dead. My jaw actually dropped during the training and pacification of the zombie scene - straight from Day! Aside from flimsy plot, average direction (oh how Russell has sunk since his Highlander days) and uninspired acting, the film is actually a 90 minute advert for Sony. To actually try and count the amount of Sony products clearly plugged in the film will not be possible until the DVD release but let's just say, Screen Gems had more than a movie in mind when parent company Sony approved this mess. As if this was not blatant enough, watch for how even in the darkest scenes you can clearly see the names Sony and Viao due to extra lighting on the brand items in shot.

Resident evil: Extinction,"Extinction moves away from the amateurish and dull action of the first two films and instead aims for a more polished, eye-pleasing experience. The one area which has been greatly improved is the make-up: the zombies actually look somewhat frightful compared to the shoe-polish-under-the-eye type in previous entries.The script and storyline is no different though, with it being standard enough to keep your attention. The story was never real resident evil's problem though, but instead the dreadful action scenes which conjured no sense of suspense; that what let down the previous film.The same old characters are back with new arrivals and the story continues to follow Alice as she tries to keep out of umbrella's line of sight. Many fans will be peeved with the switch to action/horror from horror/(dull)action but i think letting the characters do there business while we watch them shoot zombies in a professional style works. The character's themselves are dreary and only tepid enough for us to imagine only spending an hour and half with them, but they do there jobs in making sure the film is at least enjoyable.Overall, an step up from the previous films.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Somewhat better than #2, but my favorite is still the first","None of the Resident Evil films have been great. Part 1 was interesting and caught my attention, part 2 was boring with some nice scenes, but nothing good enough to recommend. Now we have part 3. I would say the third is somewhat better than the second movie, but not as good as the first film.In the finale in the series, mankind is mostly extinct except for a few survivors. Some of the survivors are living in the world and continue to exist by not staying in one area for too long. Other survivors include the last of the Umbrella Corporation which caused the T-virus to escape in the first place. They live underground and continue to plot how to continue living in a world over run by the undead. The Umbrella group's plan is to control the undead and train them in ways that will domesticate them and make them easily controlled, but to hell with the human survivors. This is something I don't understand. Why try to domesticate flesh craving zombies? Why not help the human survivors to extinguish the zombies once and for all and try to start a new world? That's one problem with this movie.Alice (Milla Jovovich in the role for the third time in the series)is the wild card. She wants to wipe out the zombies and help the human survivors, and now she has psionic powers to go with her fighting skills. She can suddenly create forcefields as well, but never seems to use these powers as she should. With her powers, she should be able to rid the world of the zombies, but she instead uses her battling skills with nasty blades and guns to kill them when using her powers would be more effective. I know, she doesn't seem to have good control over the new abilities, but you would think she would be willing to learn. After all, these psionic powers would make it much easier and more effective to deal with the zombie plaque, but then we wouldn't be able to see blood spray as she chops off heads and other limbs. Sigh.The story is not real strong either, and the secondary characters are never really given any depth whatsoever. The action is nice and there are several shocks and surprises along the way, but it is never enough to keep the flow of the almost nonexistent story moving along in an interesting way. The story has something to do with heading to Alaska which may still be free of the zombie plaque. However, it is never given much thought.Overall, Resident Evil Extinction is slightly better than the second film, but it still fails to match the first film. The story is weak and the characters, with the exception of Alice whom we've gotten to know in the two films previously, are also flawed. Of course Ali Larter as Claire, the leader of the band of survivors outside of Alice, offers something interesting to the story, but it is never enough. We wonder how she became this leader, but her story, like so much else in this movie, is never explored. I recommended the first film just barely, but I still cannot recommend this film even though it is slightly better than the second film.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
She's Back and she packs a punch,"As far as this genre goes, Resident Evil: Extinction (2007) earns a straight 10 in my book. Milla Jovavich is back, and her on-screen heroism personified as Alice was turning corners, thwarting sadistic adversaries, and packed a punch like you couldn't believe. She plays the part brilliantly, and I am glad I watched it. If you enjoyed the previous two movies, just let me say, this one won't let you down. I found myself actually trying to keep myself from jumping a few times, as the suspense continued. Yes, in my opinion, this franchise stayed true to excellence, the story continues to progress, and quite interestingly it left me hoping yet for the next part of the story. Great job, cast and crew.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Another Entertaining RE Flick,"At its best, this movie has great style. Watch the first scenes, as the director poses Milla as a piece of angry candy in beautifully framed shots and lovely moments like a sliver of a dress sliced in slow motion, and you can't help but be impressed. The movie doesn't consistently maintain that supermodel-of-the-apocalypse quality, but when it hits it, as in another scene with Milla and a wall of flame, it's stupendous.While the scenes without Milla are never quite as visually striking, it is all pretty exciting, including a transparent rip off of Hitchcock's The Birds.For me, the Resident Evil series represents the best of movies pulled from video games, offering pure escapist fun that is fast paced and never tries to either mock nor run away from the game's sillier aspects. At the same time, the movies all kind of run together for me; they're all good, but they are all pretty forgettable. If you're looking for pure popcorn entertainment you can't go wrong with this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Well made but less scary,"In ""Resident Evil 3 - Extintction"" Alice (Milla Jovovich) returns for more action trying to lead a group of survivors to find a safe place without the infection that almost destroyed mankind on Earth, now a desertic and apocalyptical place to live among zombies. The third part of the Resident Evil series is more light than the other films, less scary, more funny, with great action sequences and the trademark is present all the time, the famous headshots where you can say out loud headshot after a zombie got killed just like in the video games.The movie is very short, everything goes for an hour and a half, the plot is pretty much what I said and there's not only the zombie danger but also a creepy doctor (Iain Glen) that can control Alice in his new experiment supported by some form of government. Meanwhile Alice teams again with Carlos (Oded Fehr) and his friends on their way to Alaska where it is said that the virus haven't reached. Once again what makes the film interesting in the scenes between Alice and Carlos along with the group led by Ali Larter; the fights and shootouts against the zombies, some moments by the annoying doctor. The best part is definitely Carlos last moment, one of the most honorable moments for a character ever, sad but truth.Paul W.S. Anderson wrote and produced this third film and I really wish I could direct it because I didn't find the tension, the scary things that made the first episode more interesting than this one. I'm not saying that Russell Mulcahy is bad director but I felt that this film is meant to be more like an action work than a horror film and we're talking about zombies, frightening creatures supposed to scare. On the other hand the humor was vital to the film, some quotes and moments were really funny which made of ""Resident Evil 3"" a enjoyable film. The movie goes well but not enough to be the greatest of the series. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A genre romp, yes, but one that obviously benefited from more care","The least that can be said for this series is that it knows what it is. The first film in 2002 was troubled with some faults, but was an enjoyable action-horror romp. The first follow-up in 2004 unremittingly leaned even more heavily into the bombast; while it was still a passable, passive good time, its excesses, self-indulgence, and artificiality threatened to overtake the joy of the genre space it played in. It's safe to say that my expectations were low for 2007's 'Extinction,' and it's taken me this long to get around to watching just because I assumed so little of it. If nothing else is true, the opening scene alone illustrates that the saga has freely leapt from pure action-horror to also embracing comic book levels of sci-fi whimsy: protagonist Alice isn't just a fighter and a survivor, she's effectively a superhero. To this add further flavor of the 'Max Max'-style post-apocalyptic wasteland, demonstration of uncaring embellishment (e.g., I love ""In-a-gadda-da-vida,"" but its use in cinema has never not been outright kitschy), and scenes of exposition and plot development that are meaningful but nevertheless feel forced. It's not that this third installment can't still be worthwhile, but at this point it's evident that the franchise has become a creation all its own, for better and for worse.In fairness, we do get everything we want. Blood and gore, special makeup, zombies, horror violence, dark broad themes and big ideas, action sequences, stunts and effects, increasingly higher standards of CGI, and more. Producer and writer Paul W. S. Anderson again hands over directorial duties, this time to Russell Mulcahy, who ably made his mark in the past with other genre flicks - and it's a strong credit to both men, I think, that for all the extraordinary leaps that the screenplay now makes in some capacities, in other ways that are at least as important the new entry is as solid as the first movie, and maybe even better. 'Extinction' still plays with over the top immoderation, but shows more restraint on the prior ethos of first and foremost being ""slick and cool""; in turn, those moments that are meant to be ""slick and cool"" actually, truly are. Borne out primarily through the writing and direction, but aided just as well by all those operating behind the scenes and composer David Johnson, this can also claim earnest tension and disquieting atmosphere, arguably for the first time in the saga. I felt more invested while watching this than I did even with the progenitor.The crew turned in outstanding work, from sets and vehicles to costume design, hair, and makeup. Even the cinematography and editing come across as more measured and careful than was true in the past two pictures. There's no mistaking that the end result is still a total romp with plenty of its own examples of extreme self-gratification and wholehearted balderdash, and to be sure, the more a scene relies on CGI the worse it look (""same as it ever was""). At the same time, those embellishments and other most tawdry elements that first greet us early in the length do not endure as the story advances. Both the action and the horror are more hard-hitting and impactful, striking chords and evoking feelings that 'Resident evil' could not and 'Apocalypse' didn't even try to. Benefiting from more judicious, thoughtful storytelling and film-making, the cast illustrate acting abilities that they did not have the opportunity to show before (in addition, of course, to strutting their stuff as action heroes). For all its faults, and all the reasonable criticism one may lay at the feet of this title, I'm inclined to believe it's the best up to this point of Anderson's reimagination of Capcom's iconic survival horror games.It still falls well short of perfect, or must-see material. Whatever it is you want out of this feature, there remain other places to get it that are more sure-footed, and ultimately more deserving; in terms of finding things to watch, other works have a higher priority. Yet with its swirl of action, horror, and sci-fi, and the obvious substantial skill, intelligence, heart, and care that went into it, 'Extinction' makes an excellent impression easily surpassing its predecessors. Purists may well still walk away unsatisfied, yet for those open to the wild blend of notions this portends, there's real, quantifiable value here. Don't necessarily go out of your way for it, but as far as I'm concerned I'm happy to say that 'Extinction' is an entertaining, engrossing slice of cinema, and it earns my firm, glad recommendation!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Stop being so close-minded and watch it,"I've been expecting this movie for so long and I couldn't believe how excited I was that it was finally the 21st. I was on my quest to purchase the tickets online (to avoid lines at the cinema) when I saw that the rating of this movie on some websites wasn't even 3. I wondered what the hell was happening. I decided to still get the tickets and watch it. The story is pretty much advanced now since the state of the characters and the scenario has changed dramatically. The plot has a strong base and continues to bring pretty good action scenes. There are some scenes that were a little boring and sent my mind somewhere else (which is something I'm absolutely against of) but to the writer's defense are justified because they were moving the story forward, which is every scene's mission. A lot of people has been disappointed, and I guess it relays on the fact that, because this one is the third one, we expect something better than the first two, but basically there's no much of the story than the writer delivered and I'm thankful for it. I enjoyed the movie very much, and although it's not an Oscar-winning, I'll give it an 8. Enjoy!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Resident Evil 3!,"This actually is an average zombie/horror movie but what makes it more interesting is that it has action-packed scenes which are great. I am not saying that this movie is not good but it is just the old trick, the same usual zombie movie. Zombie movies always feature hot women running and gore plus the usual type of story line. Resident Evil is based on the game which I never play. It is one of the few good game adapted although I did not play the game but the story line seems pretty interesting. Let's recount some of the previous movies that are adapted from the games. DOA is one of them and it is fairly okay. Bloodrayne is another and the two movies are trash. This is what I can recall. Let's head back to Resident Evil 3.Some of the pointers:Hot women: Check! It has number of hot women. Milla Jovovich did a pretty good job in carrying out Alice's role. Ali Larter (from the TV show, Heroes) also did a good job in portraying her character Claire. You get to see them fighting or shooting. Brave women.Gore: Check! That is the main target of almost all horror and zombie movies.It has quite a lot of gore and blood considering. It is more bloodier than Resident Evil 2. You get to see the usual gore like zombie biting people and others. It did a good job just not only for gore but the action stunts. That makes it not like most of the zombie movies. It has both the gore and the intense action.Storyline: It is better than Resident Evil 2. It has the simple story line to keep up. The story is Alice resurfaces to protect convoy of the uninfected towards refuge in Alaska. Simple and short. Along the way, you get to see Alice cutting zombies, doing high kicks and others.Overall, it does make a good harmless movie to watch during the weekends. It may not be the best game adapted but it certainly got the guts. You like both action and horror movies, this is for you.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Resident Evil: Extinction might be the most competent instalment, but it's the start of the series' eventual downfall.","Need further clarification? When your source material is primarily focussed on zombies and undead creatures, you should utilise that. The inclusion of and genre shift into science fiction decreases the believability of any situation down to zero. Hear me out. Five years have passed since 'Apocalypse' and the world is undergoing desertification. Alice finds a small convoy of survivors and tags along, unknowingly getting closer to the Umbrella corporation. Alright, so my main problem now is that Alice is overwhelmingly invincible. She discovers new abilities that pretty much turns her into a female telekinetic zombie kicking crow burning badass terminator. Any situation now going forward, I know she'll be just fine...problem is, I no longer fear what happens on screen. The supporting characters are lifeless so any demises that are met are just pretty to look at (in a non-sadistic way). Watching Milla Jovovich growing as an action star still remains this series' best quality. The post-apocalyptic deserted wasteland looked authentic and suited the film's environment well. We finally have ourselves a memorable antagonist, who then turns into one of the video games' greatest bosses, Tyrant. Shame they really didn't execute it well, let's ignore that part for now. Iain Glen as a villain always works, I mean look at 'Lara Croft: Tomb Raider'. The action is well filmed and I especially loved the entire scene involving the infected crows. Probably the most memorable segment of the film. I just wish they stuck with just zombies instead of all this convoluted cloning rubbish which only gets more insanely stupid as the franchise progresses. So yes, technically this film is one of the more competently directed and executed chapters but, again, does suffer from narrative stumbles, expositional flashbacks and a ludicrous pointless science fiction vibe that just doesn't stick well with me.

I do not play video games at all, so was not a fan of the game before the movie. I also think this was just as good as the first two. People in the audience including me applauded at the end.

Bring on No. 4.......,"As I go through the 3rd film in the franchise 3 things have become extremely clear to me.1)The movies have improved after outing specially on the technical aspects like acting, direction special effects etc.2)The sequels always promise more and deliver less.3)The potential is increasingly underutilized.Which means that although technical aspects have improved after every movie, the net rating of every movie has been roughly the same thanks to the last 2 points.I find it hard to believe that even though this is no.3 after I see the end im actually looking forward to the sequel a trend which I've observed in all the 3 films.All this being said lets not forget that this is out and out mod-high budget Action/Horror flick which is obviously more suited to the guys, the element of horror is also increasingly decreasing through each sequel, again a case of not living upto its potential (a post apocalyptic zombie infected planet was perfect for genuine horror moments).If any one expects more than a few great action scenes, good special effects and a few hot chicks from such movies than hes a fool.This movie starts with promise and remains within a band throughout the movie except for the climax where it lets down, for the first time in the franchise. However the absolute end has me even more excited the previous ones for the sequel.Milla looks good in a role she has made her own, like everyone else many of whom a reprising their roles from the earlier films.The acting was good all around, nothing special here and none was expected.Most of the scenes were good, ones that really stood out was the failed rescue attempt and the fight in Vegas.Other than that this movie moved along at a leisurely pace which is really why it should have excelled in the horror department and maybe with some better dialogues, even some scientific mumbo jumbo/delving a bit into the ""pseudo universes"" history would have actually made it more interesting.The soundtrack was good once again and well used.I wonder how much the tobacco lobby (if there is indeed one) contributed to the budget of this film??Despite the fact that i always expect something from this franchise, given its simple no-nonsense approach to entertainment, this is the 3rd film and I always expect at best what i got in the earlier movie (which more than what i expect from most sequels).There is perverse pleasure in seeing things being killed/killing things when there are no strings attached (your doing the people a favour by killing them you see) and zombie movies/video-games have cashed on this for decades.Fans will continue to enjoy this film, while there is something for the first time watchers.People who love to find goofs, plot holes and continuity errors will have field day in this movie. It is advised to stay away from these activities, or only indulge in them in the slightly less interesting parts of the film.If you are a fan you can pay premium rates, otherwise a DVD rental or cheaper rates are recommended.-s OK dialogue almost no horror, delivers much less than it promises, lackluster end, wasted potential, lacks the frantic pace of the earlier movies.+/-s WHAT ELSE DO YOU EXPECT??!!!.+s some really good scenes, once again promises a great sequel, everyone does a good job, technically sound, well used soundtrack.total 6/10 ( i mean you cant really expect more, I would have given it more for meeting expectations but it would have been detrimental.

Resident Evil: Mad Max,"Time and again the recipe American movie revolves around guns, gasoline and military like organisms. It is getting more ridiculous still when the action takes place in a post-apocalyptic desert. They don't have food, water or any future, but they always have plenty of gas and bullets.This part of the series takes bad writing to extinction. Alice has psychic powers and she uses them about three times in the whole movie, four if you count sleepwalking (sleeppsyching? :) ) with only one significant result. Everybody else dies, either stupidly, heroically or semantically (they leave for Alaska which is remote, but still in the States. There is no reason to destroy the world if you can't be patriotic :). Also, the good psychotic doctor also becomes some mutated monster, then dies.Also, being a front girl for a cosmetic company has its downfalls as well: poor Milla looks like she has smooth plastic skin.Bottom line: the first movie was fun, based on the game; the second was a bit stretched, but still entertaining enough; the third is a waste of time.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Resident Evil: Extinction isn't a great movie, but it offers enough entertainment value to warrant a watch.","Resident Evil: Extinction (2007) is a film I recently rewatched with my daughter on Prime. The story picks up after the infected escape Raccoon City. A group of survivors plans to head to Alaska, believing it to be a safe haven. However, their journey across the Midwest, including a stop in Las Vegas, is filled with unknown obstacles. Fortunately, Alice is there to help.Directed by Russell Mulcahy (Highlander), the film stars Milla Jovovich (The Fifth Element), Ali Larter (Final Destination), Oded Fehr (The Mummy), Iain Glen (Game of Thrones), Mike Epps (Friday After Next), and Ashanti (Coach Carter).I appreciated the return of so many characters from the first two films, which added continuity. However, the storyline is thin and straightforward. The heavy use of CGI works well enough, with a clean look and a visually striking depiction of a decayed Las Vegas. The bird attack scene stands out as a series highlight. The acting is solid overall, with Ashanti looking gorgeous and Epps adding humor. While Alice (Jovovich) feels a bit overdone at times, she remains compelling enough to make you want to see what's next.In conclusion, Resident Evil: Extinction isn't a great movie, but it offers enough entertainment value to warrant a watch.

Never thought Post-Apocalyptic Horror with Zombie Birds would be this decent,"Oh yes, I enjoyed ""Resident Evil: Extinction"" quite a bit. I liked the first one, nothing wrong with it really. I was a little bit disappointed with how the second one turned out, on some levels. But this third one really felt to me like it put the whole concept and storyline back on the rails again. As far as that goes, the post-apocalyptic setting - and me being a sucker for it - had even little to do with it. But in general, yes, it did grab a hold of me. For such a setting, it totally had the right look & feel, just like it should. The zombie crows were undeniably cool, whether you liked them or not. A bit sad they only had them featured in one action scene. What I did like about the previous film, was the hint at the ending regarding Milla's character developing telekinetic abilities. I was really satisfied to see a bit more of them in this film. I'm granting ""Extinction"" a whole extra point for the sole reason it managed to entertain me the most out of all three films so far. Unexpectedly, this turned out my favorite so far. Not bad, for a third film. And for once, I don't mind seeing a horror franchise go on, as I have some hopes now for 2010's ""Afterlife"" installment.

Alice in Zombieland 3: Uncharacteristically average.,"This third outing was disappointing because after two successful outings (above average releases) Resident Evil had become for me a sort of ""brand name"" you could trust. My problem with this third installment is that no real care was given to quality of story, characters, and special effects. I wish, for instance, that it had a more suspense and some more surprises; more interesting supporting characters (none of them had any personality folks); and was more visually imaginative.Basically our heroine is now aimlessly wandering the dusty plains on a dusty motorcycle in a dusty coat (reminding me of some heroic western tough guy if you substitute the motorcycle for a horse). The story begins with her waking up naked reminiscent of the previous Resident Evil but she's covered by a white sheet and we don't get to see anything (Damn it to hell!!). Somehow managing to score some rugged, bad-ass girl duds, a motorcycle, and various weaponry, she eventually hooks up with a bus load and truck load of survivors (unzombified) who are looking for other survivors and the promised land, or something. In the mean time some mad scientist who has been trying to find a way to control the zombies discovers that our heroine, the original Alice, is still out there somewhere with the precious T-virus antidote in her blood. So he sets out to snare her so he can bring her back to his lab and have his way with her (Can you blame him?).Finally: This -in my opinion- is an ""average"" flick unlike it's 2 predecessors. I recommend it if you have nothing better to do right now and in need of some mild (standard) zombie entertainment. Before I went to see this movie, I didn't read or listen to any reviews; I just grabbed my wallet and crammed as many nieces and nephews in my car as I could and sped off like a jack rabbit on crack (I do so love kick-ass women, folks). Well I won't be doing that again. I must have blown 80 bucks on that mad, impetuous day (I'm like a 5 yr old when I get excited). -Don't get me wrong, I'm not sorry I saw it. I'm just sorry I rushed when I could have leisurely waited for an invite from someone who was going (and paying) or who rented it or bought the DVD later on. Listen, you might think better of this 3rd Resident Evil than I do. I saw, for instance, that another IMDb reviewer gave it a whopping ""9 stars"".

Resident Evil Goes Mad Max...,"Resident Evil Extinction the third in the series again stars Milla Jovovich and picks up after Apocalypse. This time the action is set in the desert and scenes have more than a passing nod to Mad Max. Russel Mulchay directs, the director of the classic Highlander. His direction here is serviceable and it appears the film was shot on a tight budget. Action scenes range from poor to ok and are shot in such a way that it is hard to tell at times what is going on. We have some recurring characters from the previous film but i feel these were a bit wasted and underdeveloped. There is fun to be had with the film, the evil doctor steals scenes and there are some jumpy moments and the film zips along with a 90 minute runtime. Ultimately though Extinction is merely an ok film and definitely a step down from its predecessors.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Resident Evil jumps the shark,"The first Resident Evil will always be remembered as helping to reignite the 'zombie genre.' Its sequel wasn't as well received (but I liked it, as it was the first zombie film that dealt with the 'middle stage' of an undead outbreak, i.e. not the start of it and not the desolation it eventually causes, but the panic as it slowly takes over).There's no arguing that writer/director Paul W S Anderson had direct a stylish movie, filled with classy action scenes and blazing guns. However, just because something is stylish, doesn't mean it's that good. By the third outing, I was hoping for something a little more than Milla Jovovich just shooting and kicking hordes of zombies (and dogs... always dogs). Unfortunately, that's all this is - one shooting/kicking/knifing zombie scene after the next.What makes it worst is the baddies - they're almost too comically bad to be believable. They all seem to come from the 'Monty Burns School of Villains.' They're so evil, they wear sunglasses indoors and wilfully sacrifice scores of their henchmen without batting an eyelid. They should be in an Austin Powers movie, or something a little more tongue-in-cheek. However, the Resident Evil films are dead serious and the baddies just make me laugh (almost as much as the truckload of zombies which can fit a thousand of them in a simply trailer - watch the Las Vegas scene to see what I'm talking about).Sadly, even with all its flaws, the third Resident Evil film is actually better than its successors - films 4 and 5 are even worse (or as completely identical, making them all just blur into one).Unless you're a die hard fan of the franchise, I'd just stick to films 1 and 2 - either that or you can never have enough of seeing Milla perform one flying roundhouse kick after the next in slow motion.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

endtroducing... Resident Evil,"Well, I just watched RE 3.. and I really have to say the writer (some Paul Anderson, apparently) does deserve credit for taking his profession to a whole new level. Seriously, he achieved something DJ Shadow did for music back in the days: making a whole album/script out of samples, without ever using one bit of content he came up with himself. Just that for a film, this concept somehow doesn't seem to work as well as it did for electronic music. The most obvious ripoff, as others have remarked before me, is of course from Day of the Dead - RE 3 is in fact barely short of qualifying as a remake: cf. the underground base with the zombies around the elevator area, the virtually identical telephone-scene with the ""educated"" zombie and the mad scientist etc., etc. But by no means does it end there. Other ""featured"" movies would include Mad Max, Alien(s), Matrix, X-Men, even The Birds... you name it. Virtually every scene feels like you have seen it somewhere else before, and as usual the originals were somewhat better.To be honest, apart from this, it wasn't that bad. Holes in the plot are frequent, yet not big enough to earnestly distract you, and dialog/acting is not bad enough to ruin the tension. Alongside low expectations, not having any relations to either the series or the game plus having a soft spot for Milla Jovovich (I loved the 5th element when it first came out) certainly helped making this flick quite tolerable for me. All in all, I felt adequately entertained, which after all is about the only reason one would watch an action/horror flick like this. Clearly in the ""If You Got Nothing Else To Do, Might As Well Give It A Try""-category, 4/10 from me.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Mad Max with zombies...,"Yes, this movie to me was very good and action packed. However, I am not a movie critic just an average guy that likes to see loads of head shot action. If I were a movie critic I would probably say it was not very good. I was impressed that they picked up from the last one, as they did not seem to forget plot points I thought they might have from part two. The only thing missing were the little girl survivor from the last movie along with the Jill Valentine character (which made me a bit sad). Still, one could just figure they died along the way so their absence by no means hindered the plot. So what is the plot, the world is overrun by the undead, infected by Umbrella's t-virus. Umbrella still exists, still experimenting for the good of themselves. Survivor's roam the lands, some by themselves...Alice for example, some as tightly knit roving communities on wheels that include a couple of familiar faces from part two, and then there are rednecks, who are idiots that deserve what Alice does to em. Alice meets up with her old friend and the caravan and plot a course towards possible salvation, meanwhile an Umbrella scientist once again locks in on her and needs a blood sample. Yes, this movie has loads of zombies and other nasty creatures and it has lots and lots of action. From an undead crow attack, to a Las Vegas zombie attack to a final showdown in one of Umbrella's hive facilities. This movie was very good and if this is the last one it ends on a good note in my opinion.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Another Apocalyptic Movie,Another franchise of the popular zombie and computer series. A post apocalyptic setting. Acceptable acting. Predictable dialogue. Cheesy special effects.

I've never liked the movies at all but If I was to choose this is the only one I tolerated,Let me start by saying that all these movies were trash from the start.

Not My Favorite Evil,"I love the first two Evil's, full of great action sequences, an intriguing plot and some great scenes and dialog. But after watching this one, I was left feeling a bit flat and disappointed. This was my least favorite and I thought some of the scenes were trying too hard to be like the other two films. Sure, it's better than some movies, but it's the worst and the let down of the series. The fact Jill and Angie's stories are just ignored completely upset me, and I thought some of the scenes jumped too quickly. I hope they make a 4th just to tie up all the loose ends and hopefully they'll get a different director who will be able to take this series back into the right direction.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A very entertaining movie.,"I'm glad there are a lot of people who liked the film. I thought it was a great addition to the trilogy. The action was constant and they continued the story from the last movie well. There were a few plot twists and great action. Isn't that all you expect from these movies.I keep watching people bash this movie and wonder what the expectation was. Did you want a romantic comedy or a huge box office smash. I figured when I walked in to see an action movie with a lot of violence and gore. Guess what I got. The story line was o.k. and the character development was zero but it still was enjoyable.If you want action and violence and an enjoyable movie go see this. If you want a masterpiece go to a film festival and whine about everything there in your non-paid critic environment. Take my word on this, none of these will be the greatest movie you have ever seen, but they can sure entertain you for an hour and a half.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
More of the same but looks better,"The third film in this franchise sees Milla Jovovich return as Alice and essentially portraying very similar acts and stunts. The budget here is noticeable bigger and the sceneries look better as a whole compared to the previous film.The story isn't anything special but it's the gore and effects of the zombies that are mostly present.As a whole Jovovich is in top form as a one-woman show, but it seems like everything else is performed to be a distraction from, some of the best and most interesting scene in the finished film are simply Alice doing what Alice does best. Extinction is more engaging that Apocalypse but delivers essentially more of the stunts.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
A little bit above the line of mediocrity.,"Resident evil 3 starts out mediocre, and from that standpoint I was expecting a good an hour and a half. Sure there was more action and more credible plot than the first two.....but not enough of the actionA fairly interesting storyline.....At least interesting enough to keep my attention. But frankly I was expecting way more violence. Don't misconstrue me here. I did not hate this movie. it's just that I was expecting more and what I got was average.Although this film is not an impressive action film, it had some interesting aspects. To start with it was filled with a brilliant cast. The acting was vital and it has serious actors suitable for their roles. Also the special effects were amazing. Whoever did the makeup for the zombies should be proud.The other thing I liked was the linkage of all the scenes to one another, nowadays movies are made(such as ""The Grudge"" franchise) in such a way where you need to rewind and fast forward in order to grasp the purpose of the scenes. in the contrary in ""Resident Evil:Extinction"" the sequences were highly comprehensible from the very beginning to the end. The scenes weren't filled with junk dialogues.I have said these positive things about this movie. Yet as overrated as it was I was expecting a mind blowing action and a remarkable film that leaves me with nothing to say but ""WOW"". For a third movie in the franchise, extinction is not bad at all. However it doesn't surpass the hype.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
I gotta shotgun,"Whereas it is easy to sympathise with Alien, Terminator, Matrix (etc.) fan boys for feeling shortchanged and insulted as they watched their beloved franchises complete the circle from B-movies masquerading as A-movies to ending up as D-movies, I'll never understand the Resident Evil crowd's objection to these flicks. The original video games were not brain food with lines like ""Jill sandwich"" and ""you, the 'Master of Unlocking'"" delivered by the most stilted voice actors heard since the Zelda CD-I games. Also, considering Romero and Co. have botched the simple concept of the zombie genre, it's fun to just escape into the post-apocalyptic fantasy land where slow moving flesh-eaters 'live' again.It helps that I never enjoyed the entirety of Mad Max, Alien Resurrection, The Matrix, Land of The Dead and any number of other movies this steals from. And that they only chose to steal the good stuff and trim away all the talky bits. So instead of all that cod philosophy horsesh*t and exposition meetings with the Yoda Oracle that bore you to tears, you get Milla Jovovovovavich able to bend time and space until Umbrella turn off her power switch. Simple.The film starts off with a clone Milla biting the dust: 'Evil corporation constantly cloning until they find the perfect specimen' cribbed from Alien 4. Steal from the best, I guess. This was cool. A concept so illogical that it pulls you into the fantasy. Cut to a Mad Max rip off of a truck or bus or whateverdafu*k pimped out in faux-Megaweapon armor dicing the head of a zombie as the kids aboard Dead Reckoning cheer. This was also cool... just because. Some other stuff happens like that annoying comic-relief character from the second movie getting bitten and Milla acting a more likable lead for once. Both very cool. Come to think of it, this movie is perfect at quickly dispensing with secondary characters you had just assumed would become permanent fixtures. ""Mar, I don't like her... oh cool she's enveloped by crows!"" it took him two movies to get there, but Paul Anderson now knows that people don't want to be annoyed by those on screen.Although this movie lacks fundamentals like a fortified mall or a Tenpenny Tower safe zone, a Milla ginger muff shot, and a scene of a drunk sniper in a cowboy hat taking gleeful potshots of ambling zombies fueling every ten-year-old boy's dream lifestyle (they used up all three by the second pic), it does have Super Milla64. An indestructible super badass who's super motorcycle boots drove me to cross dressing with super envy. All the wire work in the climatic super duper zombie showdown in a very sandy Las Vegas elicited the same ""woah!"" from me as when I first saw Ted Theodore Logan bouncing off the pillars wasting regenerating video game enemies with unlimited ammo. And that's kinda the point.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Worth a few hours.,"Now i don't give long rambling reviews on films, i don't drone on about their effects, casting, writing or directing. I could for this film, the effects were great, simple, believable and effective. The casting was meticulous, (specifically the gorgeous Milla Jovovich). Basic writing and decent directing.However i feel the main issue with Resident Evil, is that the plots are becoming rather stale, take this one, Predictable end and action scenes. I will give credit for the opening scenes, they did grab my attention, however i feel the film would of lost my interest if Milla Jovovich wasn't kicking ass in shorts.Basically the film is relying on the simple format that is zombie films, Girls, Guns, Guts and Gore. But this system has made good films in the past and so probably will for Resident Evil.Obviously we can expect another, following the same typical ideas that conclude all Zombie-like films. Hopefully it will have a more interesting plot. I found this film to be worth viewing, but not twice, its good for a spare evening and especially if you've seen the others.Overall, quality, easy on the eyes, action is all anybody wants from a zombie film, and this delivers it perfectly.

"Surprisingly good sequel than improves greatly over ""Resident Evil:Apocalyspe"".","Several years has passed... When the virus spread in Raccoon City, which the city was overrun with Zombies and all sorts of Monsters. It was an huge disaster in the city. But the virus went all over the world and the world changed into one big desert. Which several city in the world like Las Vegas, Nevada is nearly cover in sand. Like Food, Gas and Water is very limited. Alice (Milla Jovovich) is still hiding from the evil Umbrella Corporation and she travels alone to find an safe place. She tries to stay away from her contacts to not endanger her friends or herself. But the last time that Alice was with Umbrella Corporation, they did some experimenting on her. Now Alice has certain power in her that she doesn't quite understand how to use it or embrace it. Alice's friends like Carlos (Oded Fehr) and L.J. (Mike Epps), along with a group of survivors are trying to find an place. Where they could live in peace and without fear. The leader of the group is Claire (Ali Larter), who tries her best to find an haven for the group. While the corrupted scientist Dr. Issacs (Iain Glen), who works for the Umbrella Corporation tries to make the perfect Alice clone and trying to make certain Zombies have a mind of their mind. But Dr. Issacs has other plans for Alice, The Umbrella Corporation and himself.Directed by Russell Mulcahy (Highlander, Resurrection, The Shadow) made an enjoyable Action/Horror/Sci-Fi/Adventure that improves over ""Resident Evil:Apocalyspe"". Which the 2004 sequel was an watchable movie but in the end results... it was an mess, despite an good cast. Now the third film is closer to Paul W.S. Anderson's original picture but Mulcahy does have his own visual style as well. Anderson's screenplay certainly gives visual homages to George Miller's Mad Max Trilogy, Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds, George A. Romero's Day of the Dead, the original Resident Evil movie and more. Although his screenplay is quite flawed but it is clever and exciting at times.DVD has an clean anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an enjoyable commentary track by the director and the producers, four featurettes and deleted scenes. The last and third feature was an major international success. Critics did certainly hated this film but it is fun to watch. But the best thing in the picture is Jovovich, which she's in great shape in the film and there's a few genuine surprises in store for the fans of the ""Resident Evil"" movies. Despite some plot holes in the story, overall ""Resident Evil:Extinction"" is entertaining and it should keep the fans happy. Super 35. (*** ½/*****).",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Easily the best entry in the series.  This should be called: ""Resident Evil: Extinction OR How to fix a franchise after the awful second film!""","Wow. I mean... WOW.How did they do it? How could they make such a comeback after the franchise-killing disaster of a film that was the second movie- ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse.""I'll admit, I'm only a casual fan of the ""Resident Evil"" film franchise. Mainly because it still bothers me how completely it disregards the excellent source material, and instead completely re-writes the story and characters. But I liked the first film fine enough to give the rest of the franchise a shot.I didn't think there was any way to salvage the series after the last film, though. Back in 2007, I was dreading this movie, because ""Apocalypse"" was... well, an apocalyptic mess. So you can imagine my surprise when I walked out of this film saying to myself ""Wow... this was actually better than the last one. In fact, this is probably the best of the three!""And yes, I still firmly believe now in January, 2014 (with five entries released with a sixth on the way) that this is the best of the ""Resident Evil"" film franchise. It's the film that has the most fun action beats, the best use of horror elements, the most interesting directorial choices and probably the most coherent and developed script of the bunch.Sometime after the last film, the T-virus has spread the world over. Affecting not only humans, but plant and animal life, the world has slowly been degenerating, leaving much of it a worn-out, dystopian desert. Alice (Milla Jovovich) has become a wanderer, seeking to survive in the harsh remnants of society. However, after connecting with a convoy lead by Clair Redfield (Ali Larter) that also homes her former allies Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr) and L.J. (Mike Epps), Alice and the group are pulled into a new struggle against not only the zombies who roam the earth, but the remnants of the Umbrella corporation, including the dark plans of Dr. Isaacs (Iain Glenn), one of the scientists who had experimented on Alice in the past.The cast is much stronger in this film than it had been before. Jovovich is once again a pure blast of fun, and a great hero to follow. (Although I will admit, her dark, brooding nature started to wear thin on me at times, after realizing she hasn't changed much during the series) Returning cast members Oded Fehr and Mike Epps are also more grounded and real this time around, and they come off as far more fleshed out than they were in the cartoonish previous film. And new cast members like Ali Larter, Iain Glenn and even Linden Ashby are generally fun and give decent performances.This time, directorial duties are handed over the talented visual artist Russel Mulcahy, best-known as the stylish director behind the original ""Highlander"" (which I consider to be a great film) and the well-directed Alec Baldwin vehicle ""The Shadow."" (A film I admire very much in terms of visuals, though I will admit the script is very standard and underwhelming.) And Mulcahy is able to make himself very much at home, giving us well thought-out action set-pieces that are actually exciting to watch, as well as giving a bit more time to the character development for quiet moments that the first two films lacked. Out of the five films, this was the one I found the most professionally put together.The script by Paul W.S. Anderson (whom directed the first, fourth and fifth films and has written every entry in the series) is surprisingly deliberate and thought-out for Anderson. Not to speak poorly of Anderson (I quite liked his films ""Event Horizon"" and ""Mortal Kombat""), but he is generally a director and writer who seems more interested in visual spectacle and entertainment than storytelling. And there's nothing wrong with that necessarily. But I did find it surprising that he seemed to put much more thought into this entry than any other. And I think it helped a lot. It's a tight, concise script, and it makes for a decent film.The rest of the production is going above and beyond as well. The set design is top-notch. The costumes feel more grounded and realistic, while still maintaining a stylized look. And the effects are great. Particularly the zombie makeup effects, which are an absolute blast. The music is also a step-up from the last film.I was really surprised by how well-made this film is, especially compared with the other entries. It's not a perfect film by far. This is still a dopey series that is about pretty pictures and visuals first and foremost... but by those standards, this is easily the best of the series. It has the best action, the best horror, the best direction, the best effects... it's just... the best of what it is.I give this film a good 7 out of 10. I loved it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Easily the worst of the three,"I must profess to being somewhat a fan of both the first and second RE movies (having watched both several times), so was quite looking forward to the third instalment, especially having read some of the comments by other posters on the site. Unfortunately the film failed to live up to its predecessors in every way. The musical score, right from the start, was poor and largely grated on the nerves, unlike the smooth hypnotic sections from the first two movies. The film had 'b' movie written all over it, the acting was passable at best, the script poor and some of the set pieces laughable (alfred Hitchcock anyone). Its a shame the series has ended (assuming it has) on such a low note.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Resident Evil: Extinction: They are finally doing the games part of the movie and it makes more since now.,"I would just have to say that I am a harsh movie rater cause I know what I like and I think that people might like the samething's that I do when it comes to movies. There is just TOO many reason why I gave this a 10 out of 10. I am not going to be like a lot of people that are doing reviews on this movie and spoil it for you. I can't stand people that do that. But the Bio-Hazards (zombies) look even more real than the first to movies. They look like something that Stephen King or Rob Zombie would have came up with. The way that the 2nd movie ends will make since to you when it gets 15 to 20 minutes in the movie. The only bad part in the movie is the beginning (flashbacks of the first to movies). Milla Jovovich, Oded Fehr, and Mike Epps does a killer (no pun attended) killer job on their roles. They finally put Claire Redfield (Ali Larter)in the movie and she kicked a** also. For the people that played the game Albert Wesker (STARS) is in the movie and they have the right guy to play the role and that is cause the guy is kinda like a a**hole. The main guy (monster) at the end kinda makes Nemises look like a little school girl at church. The only thing that I really don't agree with is the way that it ends. It makes you want more and that is the only downfall to the movie. But pose to the questions on here there will be a 4th movie and it picks up with Clarie, Chris, and Jill (chick from the 2nd movie). In closing I would just like to state..... WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU WAITING FOR, FOR IT TO COME OUT ON DVD!!!!!!!!!! GET YOUR BUTT OFF YOUR COMPUTER AND SEE THIS DANG MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!

Definitely Worth a Watch,"Having escaped from the Umbrella Corporation in the last picture, ""Alice"" (Milla Jovovich) is now on her own and is riding a motorcycle in the middle of a desert wasteland somewhere in the vicinity of Nevada. On a separate journey is ""Carlos Olivera"" (Oded Fehr) and ""L.J."" (Mike Epps) who have joined a caravan of survivors led by a person named ""Claire"" (Ali Larter). The problem that both Alice and the caravan face is that the zombie population has grown on such a large scale that the zombies now inhabit the entire planet. There doesn't seem to be any safe place and so the only solution is to keep on moving. Because of this, and the desolate desert environment, this movie probably captures an apocalyptic scenario better than its predecessor, ""Resident Evil-Apocalypse"". The action is fast-paced and the plot is a slight improvement over the last film. And while Milla Jovovich displays good acting abilities, the addition of attractive newcomers, Spencer Locke (""K-Mart""), Ashanti (""Betty"") and the previously mentioned Ali Larter certainly doesn't hurt this film. All things considered then, I believe this film is slightly better than its predecessor and as good as the original (""Resident Evil""). Definitely worth a watch if you enjoy this series.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

They changed too much stuff that was cool in first and second movies (like the digital Queen and the box Alice was kept in after the crash).

"Less Action, More Survival Horror","That was what i didn't like most about the first two terrible but fun adaptations but the third film Extinction shows a lot of survival horror and combines it with pulse pounding action and the supreme hotness of Milla Jovovich. The best thing about Extinction is that it is as close to the games as Paul WS Anderson is going to get but most of the kudos goes to director Russel Mulachy who clearly has a better understanding of the games and uses a lot of similar game elements to create scary and suspenseful scenes. Of course this is a Paul WS Anderson movie and you can tell by the writing because of the few but noticeable cheesy lines and the complicated and confusing plot but Mulachy makes it seem OK with his vision of Andersons movie. Visually the sets are awesome very desert like very apocalyptic i was totally impressed. The special effects light up the screen and Milla Jovovich steals the show and although she was never in the games she's as bad@$$ as Claire, Jill, or Leon are. As a stand alone movie it's every bit as great a popcorn movie as Spider-Man or Pirates Of The Carribbean cool story lots of action, some funny humor, it's fantastic high budget nonsense at it's most entertaining state. If you didn't like the first two still chance it with this one because it's a much different interpretation more horror, more jump scares, and more gory action packed thrills. Extinction is by far the best out of all three and has the most amazing looking zombies that are pretty hard to one up the only movie i can think of may be 28 Weeks Later but even still the make up gives the zombies a very Hills Have Eyes look which i find very cool. The crows are neat and i'm glad they added them because the whole scene worked well creating intensity and just that kick@$$ environment you want in this kind of movie. In closing i think Resident Evil: Extinction is the best of the series, the best choice for this weekend, and the most entertaining and fulfilling ride of the year of the threequels.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

So so,"OK, just finished this third RE and unfortunately(like the second one) it doesn't come close to the heights of the first. It totally lacks the suspense, eeriness and claustrophobia that made the first one stand out. Yes sure, we get a few jump scenes but that doesn't redeem this movie. What we get is a kind of blend between ""Dawn of the dead(the remake)"", Alfred Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" and a little ""Mad Max"" thrown in for good measure.If we for one moment forget that the first RE exists this stands on it's own as an OK action movie. Not great, not bad but OK. The production value, effects and the little acting there is are good so thankfully it doesn't come across as a b-movie.For me Milla is the main reason it survives from being really bad. She goes about her business as before with new powers á la invisible girl from Fantastic Four. Apparently she had that in the second installment too but it was a while since i saw that one so i don't remember exactly what she did with her powers in that one. The rest of the characters actually don't make any impact more than support as a vehicle to support a second storyline filling out film time. We get a few extra explosions, neck bitings and shootouts thanks to them.To the film moguls : Please stop with more RE sequels, i think you have made enough damage as it is to this franchise.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not as a good as the first two movies, but still a solid good third entry.","Honestly I was a little disappointed with this flick how it turned out to be! Resident Evil and Resident Evil: Apocalypse are my all time favorite films that I love to death, but Extinction is not my favorite Resident Evil film but I still can watch it, I love this film is not as good as the first two films were that were more scary and more darker, this film isn't! It is more an apocalyptic action film in the desert why is the film in a desert when it is all extinction? Is this a game anymore? Directed by Russell Mulcahy and written by Paul W. S. Anderson. Russell Mulcahy directed Highlander 1 and 2 my all time favorite films and he directed a lot of movies. So now Russell Mulcahy want's to make this film Road Warrior meets the zombie film okay cool idea.Plot: Survivors of the Raccoon City catastrophe travel across the Nevada desert, hoping to make it to Alaska. Alice (Milla Jovovich) joins the caravan and their fight against the evil Umbrella Corp.I still think the first two films are superior movies than this one the third one, I do have a lot of problems, again this movie is just not scaryenough to me and I don't think it is a horror movie at all. It is more a sci-fi action movie, it is still better than Afterlife and Retribution that both of the films were a let down. Milla Jovovich is back to kill more zombies in the third chapter of the hit Resident Evil franchise! An action/horror film filled with huge special effects and edge-of-your-seat terror!Then again...I got addicted to this movie and the fantastic Mila Jovovich who seems to be perfect for this role. Don't get me wrong, as a female, I actually like Ali Larter more (she plays a role in this movie too) but I think that Mila Jovovich is perfect for this role. The makers of this trilogy tried to cash in on three separate movies and I actually don't like this. Each party ended somehow with an ""unfinished business"" and I don't like open endings too much. From an action point of view, this movie is a first rate action blockbuster. But I still think Apocalypse perfectly ended the story and we didn't need the third movie or more. They should have stop by this one, after this movie the franchise went down hill.Milla Jovovich is superhuman now so there's no real threat to her. Ali Larter does OK despite being Sarah Connor-esque. Oded Fehr does good also, but lacks much screen time. I like Linden Ashby in this movie he did a decent job acting his character, Ali Larter from Final Destination 1 and 2 is in this movie and she is very sexy and very hot. Oded Fehr and Mike Epps from the second movie both come back for the third ride but they both die in this film I do have that problem!Another problem with the film I have is we see the same opening scene from the first movie just this time Alice is killed, I don't like a copy of that scene looking like Alice is dead in this movie!This movie has a lot of problems that I really don't like, but there are things that I do like:Russell Mulcahy has a good eye for visuals and it shows with how crisp the film looks. It is visually stunning at points and the editing is actually coherent. The zombie action and gore is amped up even more so and it delivers. The zombie bird sequence is actually a nice little spin on zombie attacks and it is the highlight of the movie despite some terrible CGI. Milla Jovovich is still the ass kicking Alice so nothing much else here aside from the usual fetishizing her being in towels. Oded Fehr's role gets cut short, but he's still good as Carlos. Ali Larter was OK, but she reminded me too much of Sarah Connor to take her seriously.Even tough with all those problems this film is not that bad, is definitely not a bad movie, Alice saved survivors that Carlos and L.J. were driving together she saved them from zombie birds that they were attacking them.Alice drives a motorcycle and she kicks ass the scavengers trying to kill and eat her awesome!Overall: 8 out of 10 this film has a lot of problems the first two are still MILES way better than this one, but I will still take this movie over Afterlife and awful horrible Retribution!Resident Evil: Extinction is a 2007 action horror film and the third installment in the Resident Evil film series based on the Capcom survival horror series Resident Evil.8/10 Score: B- Studio: Constantin Film, Davis Films, Impact Pictures Starring: Milla Jovovich, Oded Fehr, Ali Larter, Iain Glen, Ashanti, Mike Epps, Spencer Locke, Linden Ashby, Jason O'Mara Director: Alexander Witt Producers: Paul W.

First film I saw on Blu Ray. Hi-def doesn't make it any better,"If nothing else, this movie will be a landmark in my film viewing life: it was the first movie I ever saw on Blu Ray (a buddy bought a Playstation 3). If not for that, I'm sure it'd be one for the dustbin of my memory. Granted, it's hard to judge fairly when I never saw the first two installments of this based-on-a-video game trilogy, but Resident Evil: Extinction can only barely count as a movie. It's a post-apocalyptic zombie movie where a genetically engineered woman with excellent fighting abilities (model/musician Milla Jovovich  I refuse to acknowledge her as an actress) helps a ragtag band of survivors escape to Alaska, while she herself infiltrates the underground layer of the Umbrella Corporation, which created the virus that zombified the rest of the world. The plot is mostly nonexistent. I kind of like the set and costume designs (sci-fi being every set and costumer designer's favorite gene), and the movie's watchable when it focuses on the scenery. But it's an action movie, and, for God's sake, the action sequences are dull. CGI looks even more fake in high definition.

An Excellent Addition to the Franchise,"Resident Evil: Extinction (2007) is an action-packed, thrilling ride that delivers on all fronts. Directed by Russell Mulcahy and starring Milla Jovovich, the film is the third installment in the popular Resident Evil franchise.What sets Extinction apart from the previous films in the series is its emphasis on spectacle and high-octane action. The film features a number of jaw-dropping set pieces, including a thrilling chase through the Nevada desert and an epic showdown with a swarm of zombie crows. The special effects and practical makeup are top-notch, creating a world that feels both gritty and fantastical.Milla Jovovich delivers a standout performance as Alice, the fierce and determined protagonist who is the heart and soul of the series. Her action scenes are electrifying, and she brings a sense of humanity and depth to a character that could easily have become one-dimensional.The supporting cast is also strong, with Ali Larter and Oded Fehr delivering memorable performances as Alice's allies in the fight against the Umbrella Corporation. The script, while not overly complex, delivers on the promise of the series, with plenty of scares, thrills, and adrenaline-pumping action.Overall, Resident Evil: Extinction is an excellent addition to the franchise, and a must-see for fans of action and horror movies. Its stunning visuals, strong performances, and pulse-pounding action make it a standout film that is sure to entertain even the most jaded of viewers.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Beyond the short snob reviews.,"I recently read into some of the original ran comparisons of the titles. This one is a little more than the original Genre Nazi where the General goes to spend the time at the enemies family house. Or that of the tacking down the armored train for a box of classic cholocate. In a world where it's just better to kill off the current cast for a trade to the normal cast change. It's pretty normal. As per specific requests to the gone gore of the video games this one works out just fine in my opinion. Where the fact that the days are gone and the nights are just impossibly dangerous this title gets that covered. As much as everyone hoped that this would be just a spooky in the grass monsters they don't understand cruel horror. Beyond that it does seem to get under the skin for becoming too long for a regular sick condition. But, I would have also preferred to see more titles come from the distilled Playstation games. I can guess that the only difference was that video game developers definately drink more.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great for those who follow the game!,"When I first saw Resident Evil I thought that they had destroyed a classic , they didn't pay attention to the real game story and the effects and the acting was thin. But after the second movie I thought that they had done their job well, good effects and some of the real game characters like Nemesis made the movie ""watchable"". Now when the third movie was released i was stunned, the effects and acting was better than ever, and the whole thing with Clair Redfield and Carlos etc was amazing, almost every game character was in the movie and they were very much alike the characters in the game. This movie can of course be watch by someone who hasn't played the game, but if you have played it the storyline will be clearer. It's not a 10 because of the end, to quick with out a real solution",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Horrible !,"It is hard to say whether it was better or not, because I haven t seen any other parts of Resident evil. But in general, it was really boring for me. From the beginning it was predictable what will happen and even scenes that should frightened you were horrible. I didn't like graphics as well, in some scenes you could clearly see that it was made by computer. Zombies didn't frighten me at all, they were a little bit funny. The only thing that was good was Milla Jovovich, she is really great actor. There was nothing special about this movie. It is always the same. Music and special effects were simple. If you like sci-fi maybe you will like it, but if not as me, you will just waste time.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
This Movie = No Plot At All,"OK So im a big resident evil fan, love the games, the first movie was sooooo amazing and the 2nd one was OK. So I was super excited for this film, bought a shirt with it on there and everything, I go to the movie, and the beginning Is super good, but then there was no plot through the whole movie, seriously i was laughing throughout the movie. I was so disappointed. You know a movie will bomb when Ashanti gets involved, thats just like busta rhymes in a halloween part 50 comes out to try and make the movie good. It just doesn't happen. The graphics were sooooo bad. When alice cuts straight up through a zombie then waits a second, he moves but the slit stays in the same place, its like a crappy sci-fi original film movie. I was so disappointed. This movie had such a high potential to be amazing, but definitely was one of the worst movies I've ever seen, worse movie in the whole genre. and *SPOILER* when you see the tyrant which is dr.issac's that was just ridiculous, the tyrant cant talk, and he was using the cheesiest dialogue ever. Ill admit that their was one really good part when she talks to the program queen thing in the new hive, when shes like ""your sisters a bitch"" cuz that made it great, but other then that the movie was dull.Sorry if this ruins you wanting to see the movie, but i just don't want people to be disappointed, just stick with the first 2, you'll be happy and just think it ends there.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
"So bad, you can tell they meant it to be.","There are many things that went through my mind after Resident Evil 3: Extinction ended that made me sad. One was, that even though I knew the trailer looked horrible, maybe the movie might be a bit okay... and I was wrong.You know, I had thought I had seen it all... and then I saw the 20 minute fight scene involving ""uniformed karate action zombies"" (I AM NOT LIEING).The CG looks like it came from the deleted scenes from a batch of Dragon Wars meets Dusk till Dawn meets a Sci-fi channel original TV series CG movie.So finally, RE3 really is more of a Land of the Dead meets Day of the Dead spin off, and thus when you combine 2 crappy zombie movies.... you get quite possibly, the worst movie ever.... I give this movie a 3 because of those very few OK moments, but also because I realize that the movie was suppost to be that bad because I fell for it and still handed over my 7 dollars to go and see this monstrosity.

I also love it for its' elements of love, friends and sacrifice. Well, I was pleased with the writers choice of adding characters from the game such as Claire Redfield. Form the 2nd installment, Carlos Oliviera and Nemesis were introduced. I felt that the writers gave every character some say in the movie. Everything was clear and straight-forward.

Completely Lost in the Desert,"The Resident Evil franchise has been limping to the bank for the past decade shelling out increasingly turgid fare to an audience sure to lap it up because...what other video game movies are there The first one (2002) was okay. It was slightly enjoyable but you could tell it was adapted from a video game in that everything that moved was to be shot at. The second Apocalypse (2004) was absolutely dreadful trying hopelessly to add a complex mythology that makes little sense when you think about it.But lets suppose a killer zombie virus concocted by a seemingly omnipresent corporation is released into the populous. Mind you this corporation has a huge personal army, unlimited funds to build massive underground laboratories with complex security grids, track people with satellites and has access to nuclear weapons. And let's suppose our hero, Alice is an ultra-hot cyborg/clone/whatever-the- hell (Milla Jovovich) who wants to take this corporation down. Finally let's suppose the virus was not only released but thrived and quickly took over the globe. Thus we get Resident Evil: Extinction.The film starts with a prologue about how because the T-Virus has infected everyone and everything, most of the terrain in North America has been replaced with arid desert. Now why do we need to know that? All of the action in this installment takes place on the outskirts of Las Vegas, an area already surrounded by desert. With that in mind, that nugget of information seems unnecessary. Speaking of unnecessary; there are a disappointing amount of meatsacks in this film. I say meatsacks because, let's face it, other than Alice, all other characters are zombie food.Now there are a lot of problems with this movie but the one that threw me for a loop the most was the inclusion of Mike Epps who provided ""comic relief"" in Apocalypse and now provides stupidity in Extinction. As with all zombie movies, once you're bitten you're pretty much dead and early on Mike Epps is a dead man. So instead of telling the small band of survivors ""hey I'm chopped liver, pull over, I'll walk from here,"" he keeps his wound secret until he turns at the most dramatically convenient time. Oh and another thing, our heroine has telekinetic abilities? What...when...explain movie! Repeating the word ""T-Virus"" doesn't tell me anything.The movie ends with our heroine finding multiple clones of herself and telling the main villain Wesker (Shawn Roberts) she's gunning for him next, which delightfully sets up the next movie with fans of the series able to access the mythology with finger-banging glee. As for those on the outside; you best just quit while you're ahead.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pure suspense and action,"I was really not expecting that much from this movie - I just expected a followup to the previous ones. Especially since the producers hid the movie from the press, a move I can really not understand now, and since the last movie of Milla Jovovich, Ultraviolet, got horrible press and never was shown in any theater near me at all.But I have to say this movie exceeded my expectations and turned out to be really suspenseful and full of atmosphere, and overall a lot better than the previous one. Milla Jovovich is cooler than ever. The story is a lot more straightforward as well, and the action and fights could have been hardly better. Like all good action movies, it also contained humor, which, in this case, was rather black.It was however a bit sad that you had to know the previous movies to really understand this one and to fully comprehend all story twists, and I missed a bit the link between the last movie and this one.Its a good straightforward action movie, I can only recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Same Old,"I had already ceased to hope that this movie franchise would have a lot to do with the Resident Evil games - of whom they conveniently ""borrowed"" the name to get some easy cash from innocent fans. If you've seen the first two films, then really, there would be no reason for you to believe you'd go into the cinema and relive anything similar to the emotions the games can put you through. But ultimately, it's something else entirely that kills off this film and you can spot it with ease: it's recycled stuff.From Mad Max to Day of the Dead, The Birds, Land of the Dead and several other feature films, Resident Evil: Extinction ""borrows"" extensively. I guess that's bad in itself, but if you consider that originality was the last thing which defined the film series, then it's actually got little to say.This third time around, Alice roams through the US with her nice super-powers in her attempt to ... (this is where you find out for yourselves what her purpose is, for the most I could figure out was ""seek revenge on Umbrella"") in a world which has become completely barren and devoid of life. As a matter of fact, this little bit of info which is delivered to us in a short narration by Milla Jovovich at the beginning of the film - how the virus has somehow sucked the life out of our planet physically - is perhaps one of the most interesting concepts RE 3 has to offer, but unfortunately it's treated as such an insignificant matter that you are bound to ignore it all together. The actual storyline involves a bunch of people traveling through the desert without any real aim except for survival and the ""crazy doctor"" who tries to find a cure and in the process is corrupted by power. There's a lot of fighting, kicking, slashing and shooting going on and it's all reasonably enjoyable, but the lack of purpose to the whole story makes you feel too detached to actually care for anything, even if Milla works quite hard to achieve the contrary.Some effects are cool, some scenes are a bit creepy, some elements actually look like those from the games. But seeing a central character like Albert Wesker introduced into the series as such a moronic persona, that was just appalling. I swear I'd have thought the guy playing Wesker was somehow related to someone related to the producers, because his acting is sooo poor, I just can't bring it into words. Not to mention the fact that the guy in the film bears no resemblance to the guy in the games, but for the name and the sunglasses - I guess in a way that actually makes him symbolic to the film franchise.I guess that if you can ignore him (or don't know the original to begin with) you'll be able to cope with the rest of the film better. It's ultimately a decent slash and dash flick, but the fact that in the end it leaves you with nothing whatsoever is just not enough as far as I'm concerned. To me, this stuff will never be Resident Evil.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

The only good thing is the solid direction,"Resident Evil Extinction is better than Apocalypse, but it still makes me think that why they do that? I mean bad movies? And it is very annoying that in IMDb, there are a lot of good movies whose ratings are less than Extinction, but deserve much more. The opening scene of the movie aims to surprise the audience, but it can't. There are only two good things in this film, the panoramic views and the cinematography, this is a post apocalyptic film, a movie in dust and dirt! The abominable family at the beginnings recall Judge Dredd (or Chronicles of Riddick) and it was exciting. The second and third Resident Evil movies don't focus on the zombie action and zombie horror, there are awful sub stories and characters instead. However, when I saw that the director of Extinction is Russell Mulcahy, I cheered up, because he is a cult director from 80s and 90s, he made some cult B movies like Highlander. However, he disappointed me. However, as said, the movie has a better, solid direction. As said, in terms of direction, this is much better than the second one, but still this is not a well executed and well delivered movie. Returning to the story, the people who hunt zombies for fun from a convoy was cliché (already used by Romero in Land of the Dead) The best part of the movie begins when they arrive at New York. However, zombies's make up effects are awful, there are time-lapse shots which good news for 28 Days Later fans, but bad news for Resident Evil fans! Extinction is an entertaining movie, if all you want is just entertainment. The monster of Extinction is not as ridiculous as Nemesis, but still very uninspiring, terrible looking...

Simply a weak third film in the series.,"I will be honest, this film is not my favorite in the series,
back when this was a new release on DVD in 2008, my buddy brought
his DVD copy over and after seeing it I was let down by it, also I thought
in a sweet nostalgic way it was going to be the end of the story. I was wrong.I was mainly disappointed with it because it doesn't really do
anything different in terms of story, it's just more of the same,
but in a new location this time the Nevada desert. Also it doesn't follow
where the second film leaves off which always bugged me, even to this day. 
I really wanted to see the adventure that took place after the second 
film with the scientist's little girl.The story from this film and the three sequels on word is pretty lazy,
the action scenes are OK but what really lacks is story.
As of today I feel a little better about the film I still think it's weak
but after seeing it more often the film grew on me.The story is honestly confusing because you don't really know
what is going on it's kinda hard to explain without ruining the film.
But the action scenes are alright, luckily it's fast paced enough not to
be boring which it could have easily done.I give it a 5/10. Not the best but watchable. I'm at least glad Afterlife was better.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not very good,"So the ""Resident Evil""-movies have reached the trilogy-mark. Apparently the first movie trilogy based on a video game. I have to question if this is something admirable or not. The first two movies were mediocre at best, and this third installment is no exception.First of all the story (if it matters). The world has been completely destroyed by the virus, almost all humans are zombies and the whole ecosystem has failed because of the virus. Basically the world has been turned into one giant desert. In this wasteland a few human survivors roam, among them Alice (Jovovich). Meanwhile The Umbrella Corporation has continued their research.First of all i can say that this is probably the best-looking of the three movies. The sets are very nice and the world does feel desolate. But mostly the positive comments end there. Like in previous movies, the action scenes are the major problem i have with the movie. I don't understand what's so hard about making decent action scenes. Here we have crappy choreography, boring fights and firefights that look like people are just running around shooting randomly. There is a lot of blood and gore (obviously), but not even that manages to spice things up. I wouldn't go as far as calling the movie boring, but the more quiet moments in the movie are actually the ones that work best. And for an action movie, that's not a very positive remark.What surprises me most about this movie is that they let Russell Mulcahy direct. There are a few directors in the industry that i wonder why people hire, Mulcahy is definitely one of those. Incidentally, so is the even-worse Paul W.S. Anderson. If you look at Mulcahy's track record, there is very little (if anything) to be impressed of. He has churned out almost exclusively crappy movies. And you can also see that in the last few years he's mostly had to settle for directing TV. Why they would hire him for this movie is impossible to understand. But i guess that it's yet another sign that the bar is not raised very high when making a Resident Evil-movie...In the end i found this to be about as enjoyable as the first two movies. That is: not very. It's not utter crap, but it's still light years away from better action movies. The problem nowadays is that there are other zombie-movies being made that are so much better than these. ""28 Days Later"", ""Dawn of the Dead"" and ""28 Weeks Later"" for that matter, have raised the bar for the genre. Resident Evil doesn't even try to catch up. Which is kind of sad. I rate this 3/10.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
The best one in the series,"The first Resident Evil films were good but were Luke warm adaptations for a great computer game franchise by Capcom. However I was glad to say that Resident Evil : Extinction on the other hand offered was a nice way to cap off the saga. Set after the events of the second movie, we find out band of survivors trying to get out of the barren wasteland earth as the T-virus inflection goes global. The film wastes no time just diving into the action and moving along at a quick pace with very little gags and wise cracks as the tempo was upped. There were excellent use of SFX, landscapes (kind of mad max style), and action with gore. One thing that I loved about this movie was that it did not waste time on trying to offer scientific explanations for everything trying to make it sound intelligent as the last 2 movies did not really do a great job of it, this one just stuck to the action. Both Milla Jovoich and Oded Fehr were excellent in this as well as the alter-ego crazy woman from Heroes - although she was Claire Redfield...but to me she will forever be know as the homicidal woman alter-ego woman from heroes and Manfred Powl from Tomb Raider was very cool as umbrella research leader all keeping in touch with the spirit of the computer game. My only complaints were that I wished it had ended a little better and not on what felt like a cliffhanger. I would of also like to have seen a bit on the expansion of Alice whilst she was in the Umberealla facility rather than just an abrupt start I think that just felt a little stupid! To conclude Resident Evil : Extinction stood out on its own as a film as well as ending a saga of a very Luke warm trilogy , worth a check if you have seen both films and are fan of the games but also if your a fan of zombie movies like Dawn or Land of the Dead! Either way this lived past its expectations of being crap and you can check this out feeling entertained and satisfied unlike with Rob Zombie's Halloween.RESIDENT EVIL:EXTINCTION - 8.8 OUT OF 10EXPERIMENTATION...EVOULUTION...EXTINCITION!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

A pointless change of genre,"Global apocalypse is the most nonsensical, appalling, trash decision in this franchise one could ever imagine. Global fall of humanity is a different film trope that is unrelated to Resident Evil, because it deals with different themes and has different goals of character portrayal. A global apocalypse strips away all hope out of characters and forces creators to deal with deep emotional states (The Last of Us games) instead of sense of urgency to escape to safety (Resident Evil games), since there is no safety in this situation. This aspect is done poorly in this film or even not touched at all.Because of this absurd decision this one and all subsequent Resident Evil films have no resemblence to the game franchise, while, on the other hand, forcing some fan service for a quick cash grab by including iconic characters, who represent the game counterparts in name only. All stupid decisions that were made in every subsequent Resident Evil film were tainted by this nonsense.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Apprehensive Then Delighted,"I had the redoubtable pleasure of seeing the premiere with several good friends who were also Resident Evil fans (the films, not necessarily the games). When I first saw Resident Evil and Apocalypse on Sci-Fi, I found myself thinking ""I shouldn't be enjoying this as much as I am."" Nevertheless, something about these movies got to me and I became rather fond of them, even to the point of getting the deluxe DVDs with behind-the-scenes documentaries, etc.For the first 20 minutes, I was nervous about RE3: it was looking a lot like the first two Mad Max movies (not in and of itself a bad thing) and I sincerely believe old Russell has been watching too many Michael Bay films (and Michael should not be allowed to direct again; his MTV- frantic cutting screams ""insecurity"" to me).As the story developed, I remembered what I had such respect for in the first two films: CASTING GOOD (IF NOT WELL-KNOWN) ACTORS. We all learned from the original Alien that a top-notch cast can elevate a genre film into a classic. The script was a deliciously logical extension of the previous plots and the shift to outdoors in bright sunlight worked remarkably well. The writing was never purple and there was just enough character work to rise above a more ""typical"" film of this sort.Truly, the BALANCE achieved in this film was unusual: not too much of anything, not too little, and wonderful surprises for even, I suspect, the most jaded RE fans. It's a clean, gritty-looking (I mean cinematography) piece, spare of superfluous moments; 95 minutes long and precisely to the point in each scene. The battles are truly magnificent, in my opinion: well-choreographed, edited and thought-out. NOTHING ARBITRARY HERE, FOLKS.As William Hurt said all those years ago in The Big Chill, ""Sometimes you just have to let art. . . flow over you."" That, I think, is the key to enjoyment of this movie. Don't bring in baggage or expectations: just let it happen. You will not be disappointed.The only ""flaw"" here is, as with the previous RE adventures, a remarkably mediocre musical score; it's certainly serviceable, but ANYONE could have composed it. I long for a David Arnold wannabe to score films like this. The richness a GREAT score would add is almost incalculable.Excellent cast, excellent writing, excellent fight choreography, just the right amount of the grotesque, just the right amount of beautiful women with large weapons. And one cast member has the single greatest death scene I can remember in a long while; I envy the actor and director for playing it so well, with such subtlety and such theatricality. But go in cold. Just let this piece ""hit"" you. Bring nothing to the party but your active mind. If you can manage that, I venture you'll love it.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Surprisingly watchable,"The main thing preventing this movie from being bad is simple; despite its haunting music and similarities to ""Day of the Dead"", there's little to nothing intended to be scary. As a horror movie it would've sucked.Actually there's little that was actually noteworthy. The positives being some character deaths were actually sad & some things, including Alice not overly using her newfound telekinetic powers, were actually explained - and without treating the audience like idiotic people.The negatives included the primary antagonist being stupidly evil, for example killing his underlings or not trying to rescue them despite actually needing manpower, and pointless references to the first film which gave the impression the writers were low on ideas.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
The desert agrees with her,"Everybody loves Alice (Milla Jovovich). Every time I see her I think she never looked this good. Although from a strictly logical perspective this seems dodgy at best, it's true in a way, since she keeps changing her look and refining her style. None of which helps ""Extinction"", of course. It has its moments, but those are the scenes reprising Alice's stunning entrance from the first movie. ""Extinction"" really feels like the third installment with the ideas running out. They even lifted the subtitle of the ""Jurassic Park"" franchise. It will be especially disappointing to those who have seen the out-of-this-world cinematic trailer. It's not so much that the trailer compresses the movie's best bits. It's more that, in retrospect, the trailer seems like a preview of an entirely different movie. Also, I'm not sold on Alice's outfit, credited to Jovovich's fashion label Jovovich-Hawk. Although it doesn't look bad, it falls way short of the red dress, no pun intended. Also, I have a nagging suspicion there is no other girl in the world who could get away with these rags. The same goes for her haircut. The role of the hard-bodied super-powered trans-human desert doll obviously agrees with her. Get over Alice, I tell myself. It doesn't work.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Extremely fun movie!,"Resident Evil: Extinction is a fantastic follow up of Resident Evil and Resident evil: Apocalypse. Now, I have been quite a fan of the games since I played Resident Evil on the playstation. I watched the movies, think they are fantastic, then I come onto the internet to only find people complaining about how the movies are not like the games. I would only like to point out something: Why would CAPCOM allow the producer's of the movies to make the movies the same as the games? That would just hurt the marketing of their games, and bore the living hell out of the viewers because we've 'been there, done that'. I don't want to see a movie that I already know what is going to happen. Let's face it, if they took that route, then the movie would probably have big plot holes due to cutting down 15 hours of gameplay into a One and a half hour movie, and would not get rated high. The film makers have taken different elements of the Resident Evil games, and combined it with their own, to make a interesting, unique zombie Trilogy.Resident Evil: Extinction is set five years later after the destruction of Racoon City. Unfortunately, the horrid 'T-Virus' did not get contained, and the whole earth has now been overrun by the virus, turning everyone into the living dead. Even most of the world's water has dried up. Claire Redfield (Ali Larter), Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr), L.J (Mike Epps), K-Mart (Spencer Locke) and Nurse Betty (Ashanti) are traveling through the Nevada in a Convoy with other survivor's. Alice (Milla Jovovich) has separated herself from the group to carry out her own personal Vendetta against the evil Dr. Isaac's (Ian Glen) and the Umbrella Corporation. Alice finds the Convoy, and tells Claire about how there is possible survivor's in Alaska, making a new goal for the Convoy.Now the acting for the movie is pretty good. Not great, but good. It is what you would expect from a horror action movie. Some character's give a weak, yet passable job, such as Ashanti, and Spencer Locke. With Milla, its hard to tell. I don't know if her character is just a stiff character, or if Milla is just playing Milla, because all her character's seem to be the same. Either way, Milla work's for me, and does a good job.The action in this movie is great. It is a bit of a combination of the first Resident Evil, and Resident Evil: Apocalypse. Resident Evil one based more on horror, and less action. Resident Evil: Apocalypse got rid of some of the horror, and replaced it with cheesy, yet fun, over the top action. In Extinction, it is a combination of the first and second movie, and work's very well.With the way this movie ends, I pray to god we get a sequel, and it better be as good as this one, if not, better. If there doesn't end up being a sequel, I take my 10 star's down to a 1.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Decent. But they are forgetting one thing....,"I don't know whose's decision it was to change a lot about these films. But in my opinion. I know they should have stopped throwing in characters in the movie. That were not in the original games! I mean. The title of the films are ""Resident Evil"". They ARE supposed to be based on the game series ""Resident Evil"". And when people go to the cinemas to see ""Resident Evil"" they expect to see the game, transformed to a motion picture. I mean the first was a great film. But for the hardcore RES fans. There was no original RES characters! why call the RESIDENT EVIL if your only going to have the MANSION, UMBRELLA, A FEW ZOMBIES, A LICKER AND THE T VIRUS. That have anything to do with the game. I'm an amateur Movie Director. And since I was young, I planned on re-making the RES games to movies. Changing only minuscule details, and staying true to the games. People who watch the RES movies, who have never played the games will know no different. But I can guarantee if they had stayed true to the games. It would have been more entertaining, more action, better characters, and grossed more money. With more followers.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Wafer thin plot but plenty of scares, gun play & big flashy explosions.","Okay, okay, enough of the lowly barely average reviews already. Resident Evil Extinction solidly lives up to the bench mark laid by its two predecessors and in my humble opinion, does it in an action packed, well paced style. These films have never been anything but popcorn laden guiltless fun, with wafer thin plots but plenty of scares, gun play & big flashy explosions. What story there is drives it forward at a nice pace and I never once found myself tapping my foot or thinking when's this going to end! Put simply I totally enjoyed my viewing of R.E3 and if your a fan of the first and second, be sure to check it out. Lets hope the saga continues its solid output in the future!",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Nothing more than Chapter 3.,"As a Horror fan who has learnt of Resident Evil not through the original Capcom game, but through the Hollywood films, I've very much enjoyed the first film, and very much more the second. Extinction, the third title in the Resident Evil anthology, on the other hand, has very little (if at all) cinematic value besides being another chapter in the story.The screenplay is nice and fits right in with the rest of them, but in this case lacks the good plot twists we've learnt to expect after the first two films. The story connects beautifully with the ending of the second film, is a great start for the coming fourth, but not that goo on its own. Not much good or bad can be said about the script.The acting by the cast is good as always, Milla Jovovich and Oded Fehr are a great as they've been before, and Ali Larter (as this film's female addition to Jovovich) isn't another Femme Fatale like in the first two films, but more of a leader. Not much good or bad can be said about the direction and cinematography.All in all, as I've said, besides being a nice conclusion to chapter 2 and a preparation for chapter 4 - chapter 3 isn't much. Definitely my least favorite of the series so far. I very much hope that Afterlife will return to the glory of the first two films.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Countdown To Extinction or Shall We Await The 4th Part?,"I have been waiting for the third part of Resident Evil for so long that the very expectation has somehow overgrown the film itself. We had it all in first two parts  great, sexy, smashing Milla Jovovich; dead men walking; suspense; special effects to the fore; always tense line of plot And what did they offer us in the third and seemingly last part? Milla is still very sexy, she looks great even with her incredibly bad hairdos, she is sporty, strong and she fights like a man. There are dead men aplenty, and there are pools of blood a lot. The film starts not so convincingly and it goes a bit too slow and too repeated some time. But then, when other heroes appear and the action gets very tight, the film gets much better. Mind it, in today's realm of 4-hours monsters, this part with its mere 90 minutes seems a short condensed blast of pure energy. Maybe, there is not so much to think or ponder about, but who cares? After all, Milla is true to the end. She is cool, she may cry, she fights, she has a great physique, and yes, yes, fans of her body, she does appear completely naked couple of times. What else can be dreamed of? Jokes aside, the third part is a good entertainer and it holds your attention all 90 minutes + and you never regret you started watching it. The only question remains  what does the end mean? Will there be the Fourth part? After the Apocalypse and Extinction, should we expect some Retaliation or, maybe, The Last Judgment? I do not know. But if the next part is the same fast and ferocious shot of naked energy (no pun intended), I would vote for that.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Resident Evil: Cinematic Decimation,"I like zombie films. In fact, I love zombie films. So, naturally , when Resident Evil: Extinction came out, I immediately went to the local cinema and watched it. I wasn't expecting anything great -- I had anticipated the unwelcome development of the 'Alice' storyline since watching Resident Evil: Apocalypse -- but I wasn't expecting anything this bad. Here's why this film sucks: 1) The zombies are not at all scary; the make-up and choreography is appalling. 2) The 'Alice' storyline is f*cking ridiculous -- Milla Jovovich has become some sort of superhero (and has had some weird airbrushing effects done to her). 3) The plot has become boring. Not terrible, not some huge abomination... just boring. There's no development or anything. For those of you considering watching this: don't.

Surprisingly better than the first two - for an amateur,"First and foremost: I never played any R.E. game. All I know about the franchise is what I got from the three movies.That being said, I really enjoyed this adrenaline zombie-splattering action movie; away goes the annoying Jill Valentine from RE2, away goes anything resembling the ""Nemesis"" crap from RE2, while things like the Red Queen, the laser-beam corridor, the blood hounds return, and a greater picture of the world is provided. The characters finally have a little more depth to them, they have their doubts, fears and passions; civilians finally stop being automatically saint and it turns out that some are afraid, some are liars and some are wicked.True, automatic guns still have 100+ rounds per clip and ladies still have perfect makeup and flawless skin even when driving through desert and smoking 30 cigarettes a day; but this is an action zombie movie just like Doom-the-Movie or Land-of-the-Dead, and it works well as such.100 minutes well spent.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"""Sticking to the games"" idea... has gone extinct.","now i know that the title of this comment and the rating i gave this film doesn't really go together. as a film based on the popular games (which I'm a fan of) it HARDLY sticks to the games. thats where the title of this comment comes in, but as for the movie itself, looking at it as a stand alone film (looking passed its based on a game) it is a good movie, which is where the 8/10 comes in. despite it being a very good film, it seems as if the creators (of the films) wanted to make a third film so bad, that they didn't want to wait for another RE game (despite RE4) so they just made up their own story (sticking to umbrella and t-virus). T-virus whipes out entire world, convoy traveling across Nevada desert, etc.good-lots of action. crows are finally used. different take on zombies (fast ""crimson heads"" zombies) bad-literally not based on any of the games, no Nevada desert in any of the games. Ali larter was good, but she isn't a Claire redfield. actor who played Wesker-good, but his character of just sitting behind a desk-bad. i wanted to see him in action.Summary: if you are a true RE gamer and are WANTING/EXPECTING this film to cover one of the games, don't expect too much. if you are a fan but is willing to accept they (only) kept the main principles (t-virus, umbrella, zombies) then you will enjoy. in my personal opinion, i think they could have covered RE: Code Veronica instead of, t-virus whipes out entire world plot.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Right in there with Event Horizon,"As a big fan of Milla Jovovich and Resident Evil, I can only thank Ms. Jovovich for making something out of an otherwise boring movie by adding some class to what amounts to a badly written, poorly plotted, and otherwise wasted 95 minutes of yawn-yawn. Oded Fehr, Ali Larter, Iain Glen, Ashanti and others add a semblance of professionalism which is unfortunately overcome by stale lines, silly mid-plots, and missing links. Try hard as they did, their efforts were buried by B-style directing and production but did bring my vote up from a 2 to a 3.Director Russell Mulcahy and Writer Paul W.S. Anderson would do well to remember just what it was that made 1 and 2 stand out amongst all the other Action / Horror / Sci-Fi / Thrillers of the day. If they colude for RE4, I hope they don't ever again depend on cast and crew to rescue their poor work.

I was bored by the pace and only stayed for the end to see if they were saving all their money for some grand finale or battle or monster but the film was just getting worse every minute and I am dead serious about that. The characters were not developed which added to the boredom and the battle scenes didn't impress me, same old fast paced-cut-to-slow motion-head lobbing action with boring gore. This tedious film also has so many rip offs it's unsettling for a film fan; like ripping off great movies such as the Mad Max Series and Hitchcock's Birds to name a few.

The final horror-focused entry of the franchise with high stakes and some great new characters.,"The third movie in the Resident Evil franchise and the beginning slide into outright sci-fi action. Most of this entry focuses on survivors attempting to withstand the dangers of a zombie-filled apocalyptic desert. Unfortunately, umbrella's experiments on Alice have results that sometimes become the focus and begin dragging the franchise further from survival horror. I enjoyed this entry with the addition of Claire Redfield from the games, the return of Carlos Olivera, and the hopelessness of the deadly sun-scorched wasteland continually claiming the lives of the struggling survivors.

Highly impressive sequel effort,"As the T-virus circles the globe, Alive joins a caravan of survivors trekking across the American landscape hoping for salvation against the never-ending hordes of undead and mutants on their trail.Overall this is one of the better efforts for the franchise. One of the better parts here is the rather high-quantity action throughout here which gives this one an incredibly fast pace that makes this one really enjoyable. Some of the big action scenes, like the battle with the mutated dogs in the pit or a later scene in the underground complex are all about giving it some impressive gore while others figure to be more based on spectacle and action. This is mostly covered by the two big scenes in this which really give off plenty to like about it, the assault by the numerous birds on the bus campground and the battle with the zombies at the casino grounds which provide this one with plenty of dynamic and impressive actions as the spectacular image of the birds flying into and swarming the buses before being burned up by the flamethrower while later scenes of the horde of creatures battling in the sand-covered dunes of the casino grounds provides this with a large quantity of action and some decent gore. Likewise, the big mutant scores really well with a rather thrilling and ingenious battle that really makes for a fun battle as the back-and-forth nature of the brawl comes to an appropriate end, dealing nicely with the early scene of the creepy run-through of the house alone which results in one of the creepiest and most surprising twists at the end of this which gives it a rather creepy air to go along with those action scenes. That tends to be its good points and are more than enough to hold off the few flaws. The fact that the film really tends to feature a lot of rather useless scenes to pad time out and hammer home what we already know by in the series. We already know Alice is handy with guns and weaponry, so the tedious scene of her confronting the family in the desert trap makes no sense as to be included beyond the gore, and scenes of the facility testing the attempts to control the virus and mutations is nothing new that we haven't seen already as we know they're devious and underhanded. That's in addition to the rather obvious CGI which pops up here for the scenes of the creatures' appearing en-masse, the more extreme gore scenes and the more spectacular action scenes that are quite obvious in their execution. It's all that really holds this one down.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

In fact, there was really no need to locate it in Vegas at all.Other than that, the movie is OK as far as zombie films go. However the genre has just been done to death in the past five years.

Worst of the franchise,"A pointless sequel that added nothing of worth to the franchise and failed to impress fans of the video games and fans few as there might of been of the original two films sadly the franchise only got worse in the future sequels and were all clearly made as cash grabs for whenever the latest game in the series was coming out.The movie follows Alice (Milla Jovovich) and a group or survivors including Claire Redfield and Carlos from the video game series years after the events of the previous movie the world has ended and is now a baron wasteland devoid of life the survivors now travel as a convoy throughout the Northern US staying on the road to survive scavenging as they go but now food and fuel is running out and the group is low on options and with the Umbrella Cooperation tracking Alice the group needs to decide what to do.Milla Jovovich is excellent as Alice it's just a shame the character isn't very interesting or memorable but you can tell the actors tried there best in a movie with a bad script and little character development or personalitys.There's a couple or decent action sequences thrown in guns blazing zombies being zombies Milla Jovovich doing her acrobatic fighting the zombies are now ""Super Zombies"" That can run and don't immediately just bite you which honestly is just a pointless addition classic zombies are always much more fun.I recommend this movie if your just looking for a half decent action film to watch and zone out with its not worth the effort of popcorn and a night in though.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than the second,"After watching Resident evil Extinction, I was quite satisfied at all of the action scenes that were included in this movie.

I did not like how they made Alice at all. This is suppose to be survival horror! Giving someone special abilities lowers the chance of tension. Example, if you were in a zombie outbreak but had the ability of quick reflexes, mind powers to blow up brains, telepathic, and so on. You wouldn't be as scared as a lone survivor with nothing but his own wits to survive. I'd give it 6.7 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Being a maniac of Resident Evil: Extinction,"The series of ""Resident Evil"" is the most classic movies among many which are also adapted from games. Surprised, in every sequel, the qualities of movie-making are above the average. Every time I watch it, it always can heavily strike terror into me. I think that the acting of the characters, the absorbing plot, and the excellent special effects are surely the causes of it being so popular.In ""Resident Evil: Extinction"", I find it quite astonishing that Alice can exert her mental supernatural power. This is totally different from its original settings. Before it, Alice showed her body strength to fight against the dead-walking all the way. In this 3rd sequel, Alice is not only a woman but already a savior of the whole world. It seems to be something excessively exaggerating to me. I like Alice who defeat all the dead-walking and save the survivors by her own strength, not supernatural power. Despite of something I dislike, I, just like a maniac, still love this movie very much. I really appreciate the bravery of Alice. Not fearing anything, Alice can survive on her own. I really wish to become her someday.I have already seen it many times. I enjoy every scene and the development of the story. After I watch it, I often feel excited and joyful.

I hope this series will become extinct sooner than later!,"I have never cared much about zombie-movies, because virtually every single one of them is utterly boring and as such a total waste of money. These mindless pictures always feature a world of undead creatures, one even uglier than the next, feasting on human flesh and leaving a small army of one-dimensional characters to fight for their lives and the survival of the human race. Mostly: these pitiful movies don't have a happy end and they never contain anything more than a lot of shooting and even more people dying in the most horrifying way. But every now and then: there is a zombie-movie worth watching. Usually director George A. Romero knows how to make a pretty good zombie-movie, but then again: he did in fact invent this subgenre. My favorite zombie-movie to date remains the 2004-remake ""Dawn of the dead"". This film does indeed have great actors in a pretty plausible plot.Whilst the first ""Resident evil"" was a pretty good movie and the second one weak but not terrible, this third instalment manages to ruin it all. It is not good at all! The acting is feeble and its characters are as dull as the stupid script in which they appear. Even the main character Alice became astonishingly dreary and ends up looking like a cheap version of Tomb Raider cyberbabe Lara Croft (whom is far more interesting; by the way).The only spectacular scene is a shameful copy of the classic Hitchcock-film ""The Birds"" and even though they use a lot more birds here, there is still a serious lack of intensity that the 1963-thriller continuously possessed. The big monster at the end is fake and ridiculous-looking and thus nowhere near as frightening as the ones of the first and second movie. It confirms the fact that nearly everything about this horror-movie is one complete failure.In short: Making movies out of videogames is always a bit of a risk, unless you know exactly what you're doing. The people behind this movie never had a clue and that results in an inevitably brainless picture.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Milla Jovovich remains the glue holding everything together,"Resident Evil: Extinction (2007) takes the franchise in a full post-apocalyptic direction, but the execution stumbles along the way. The story has a few interesting ideas, like the cloning subplot, but it lacks depth and struggles to keep engagement. The first act drags on endlessly, the second act picks up slightly, and the climax, while unique in some ways, fails to deliver the punch it needed. It feels like the movie is more focused on style than substance, which might have worked better if the pacing was tighter.The directing and editing are a mess, making the action scenes frustrating to watch. The shaky cam is back, and somehow, it is worse than in Apocalypse, making some moments borderline unwatchable. The overuse of quick cuts doesn't help either, making it feel like the action is happening in pieces rather than flowing naturally. That being said, the cinematography has some cool moments, especially in the desert setting, and the final battle at least tries to be creative.Milla Jovovich remains the glue holding everything together. Even when the plot loses steam, she keeps things somewhat enjoyable with her commanding presence and well-executed fight scenes. The script, unfortunately, does not add much, with weak dialogue and little emotional weight. The soundtrack sticks to the industrial rock vibe, but at this point, it feels like the series is relying on style to cover up a lack of substance. Overall, Extinction has moments that work, but it feels more like an action movie trying to throw in zombies rather than a true continuation of what made the first film engaging.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

The beginning of the downfall for the Resident Evil movies,"Resident Evil: Extinction (2007) is the third movie in the Paul W. S. Anderson franchise and it marks the beginning of the end for this franchise.Positives for Resident Evil: Extinction (2007):
I liked the desert setting for this movie as it feels like Mad Max. Milla Jovovich is still fine as Alice even though she shouldn't be the main character of this franchise. Oded Fehr is still pretty good as Carlos Olivera. I liked the addition of Iain Glen as Dr. Alexander Isaacs. And finally, the crow scene was pretty intense for the most part.Negatives for Resident Evil: Extinction (2007):
This is the first Resident Evil movie to be a step stone movie and set things up for the next movie and that is just bad storytelling. I also find it to be really ridiculous that Earth dried up so fast after the Raccoon City Incident. Alice is still the main character of this franchise when we should be focusing on the actual characters from the games. Ali Larter does not feel or act like Claire Redfield, she's just some woman who has the name of a beloved character from a video game franchise. I can also say the same for Jason O'Mara as Albert Wesker. You have this character named K-Mart and that name can go piss off. I would also like to know where the hell is Jill Valentine because she isn't in this movie. And finally, the Tyrant shows up in the movie and get defeated very easily by Alice.Overall, Resident Evil: Extinction (2007) is another bad adaptation of the Resident Evil games and it will only get worse from this point forward.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Suitably apocalyptic,"I think critics were unfair on this addition, my guess is that they just assumed it's another Resident Evil that will be like the others in their opinion. In actual fact, Extinction is far better than Apocalypse and more exciting than the first film because the story is better developed, the writing is solid and the characters are richly constructed, especially Claire Redfield's convoy who are essentially one big caring family trying to survive. The action is breathtaking too, Alice' powers really come to full effect, and the Las Vegas scene sets an uneasy atmosphere and the whole construction of that set is stunning. The infected crows scene is bloodily glorious, and when Alice uses her powers to deflect the flamethrower it looks incredible and shines bright, just like the Air-Brushing the editors used on Jovovich' face. This is the strongest in the franchise for story and character, and the balance between the two and action is brilliant.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Skip it unless you just want to continue the series.,"Resident Evil: Extinction, like the previous two, is more of an action movie than a zombie movie. Really, the way they pick off zombies is a lot like the way Rambo kills commies. That being said, the action scenes are decent.This movie also gets points for an attempt at originality. I'm talking about the ""zombie birds"" - I've never seen that before. However, it ended up seeming silly, and, more than anything, they just swiped the entire scene's execution from the Hitchcock movie ""The Birds."" The plot was poor and lacking, and they wasted a bunch of time on characters who went nowhere. Out the 90 minutes of this film, you could probably cut an hour and the plot would be completely unaffected.The only reason to see this film is if you've already seen the first two and are curious to see where the story is going. Although, don't expect any fulfilling conclusions because they leave the ending open for another sequel.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

BIG plot-holes and it's pretty rubbish too,"(23%) The first movie was a half-decent throwaway zombie action horror that somehow managed to be less cinematic than the video game it was based on (particularly the vastly improved remake on Gamecube), the second felt like an R rated Power rangers movie and the third (this is the third isn't it?) looks on the outset like the makers are trying something new in a location far removed from the games, and it fails just as much as the very loosely based predecessors did. The story has almost the biggest plot-hole in film history. If the virus has turned most people and animals into zombies and killed almost all the plant life, then how can the bad guys at Umbrella survive? In-fact they not only survive without any problems at all despite Armageddon throughout the planet, but they actually have the resources to clone Milla Jovovich over and over again. Who's funding all this now that Umbrella like almost every business on the planet is now officially defunct because everyone is dead? Do zombies invest in stock markets? Where does all the power/water/food come from for these guys to be so cocksure about everything? It is a B movie so it doesn't matter that much, and it can be enjoyed as a B movie but everything feels like I've seen it all before only done better and the idea of giving Alice superpowers was a real stupid one from the very start.

Not what I excepted for Resident Evil,"I always LOVED the title Resident Evil .. , was a huge fan of the game itself, and when the 1st resident Evil was out .. IT Was Amazing !

I always put it on top of the best movies in that genre .. but this seriously and dramatically changed .. resident evil 2 .. was still nice with very good acting and nice characters .. suspense ending .. nice effects .. and it kept me on edge  zombies taking over the city .. a some balanced gore .. and tense action .. but wasn't still as good as part 1 .., but now with resident Evil Extension I feel like the movie series got out of control .. out of focus and specially not as exciting as before .. , it is going to the direction of heroes or the 4400 in some way ..not a zombie movie anymore !!! I go to see resident evil I except a thriller horror movie With a lot of zombie action  in the traditional way ! , if zombies can think .. well they are not zombies any more .. no ? the movie is not well done .. I guess it got almost 1/2 the budget of resident evil 2 or maybe even less ! , you are not attached to any of the movie characters  you basically don't care who dies and who lives , so where is the gold old zombie suspense .. ? the action parts was not as exciting as we used from resident evil  I basically don't think that will make a resident evil 4 ..not worth it anymore !",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

The worst installment ever..,"Oh my god!! I can't believe that Resident Evil: Extinction (RE:E) was a waste of time! It said that RE:E is actually based on Resident Evil Code: Veronica X (Video Game).I played that game before and I don't think that the movie is actually based by it (i don't know if any of you guys notice the similarity between RE:E and RE Code: Veronica X). But there is some moments of the movie that I don't quite understand. Why is Alice left alone? Where is Jill and Angie (From RE: Apocalypse)? How did they ended up in Nevada Dessert? How did Carlos and L.J ended up with Claire? And why Claire never mentioned her brother, Chris, in the movie? Isn't Chris is a main character in the game? I was really disappointed with this one..i waited 3 years for it! And i wasted RM11 (11 Ringgit Malaysia) to watched it on the cinema..but what I know is that, they are going to do the 4th one in Tokyo..and I don't have a clue who the main character (besides Alice) for the 4th one is..but I'm sure hoping it was Jill Valentine ( to continue her journey)..or even Chris Redfield..or even, the one that I love the most, Leon S. Kennedy.I think, with all the installments, it would be easier if they just make a TV Series for it..because if they want to make the movie version as real as the game version, it would take like around 8 or 10 installments..they haven't introduce Chris Redfield, Leon S. Kennedy, Ada Wong, Barry Burton, Ark Thompson, Bruce McGivern, Kevin Ryman, Mark Wilkins, Cindy Lenox, etc, in the movie yet..What I'm trying to say is, that the 3rd installment was a disaster.

worst Resident Evil so far,"as a fan of the 1st Resident Evil i was seriously disappointed by Resident Evil: Extinction.The acting was cheesy and pretty bad. Milla Jovovich reminded me of her character in the Fifth Element and Joan of Arc - which i really liked. This movie was borderline dumb and stupid. it was dull and boring. whoever did the make up on the zombies did a very poor job as they looked like they wore cheesy 70s masks on their faces. the cinematography was OK as it reminded of old western movies. Ashanti's acting was awful, even Oded Fehr who is usually a good actor was dull and cheesy. i couldn't understand the glossy look on Milla's face also. it seems like they filtered out her wrinkles or imperfections. it seemed they blurred out under eyes, around her mouth, cheeks, and forehead - and in other shots you can see that her face looks a little different with bags under her eyes. had it not been so obvious i wouldn't keep wondering about it.it seemed like the movie was rushed into production because someone felt they had something good, but instead it looked like a movie made by a bunch of amateurs movie makers.the story was flat and boring as was the ending. this movie is for anyone that has absolutely nothing else to watch or is completely enamored with the actors.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Evil resides!,"I confess..I am drawn to B movies like moths to a flame! Despite having missed out on the earlier 2 films of the trilogy, I rented this on a lazy evening and got pretty much what I expected - bonus being some sheer eye candy in the form of the gorgeous Ali Larter and the equally lovely Milla Jovovich! The movie is a pretty straight forward zombies vs humans clash and not many surprises are in store. The familiar boo moments and obligatory gory killings compliment the action set-pieces, at least 2 of which (a vicious crow-attack & an expansive shootout set in a desolate, devastated Las Vegas of the future) are quite impressive. The plot, if you can find one, is a mere excuse to deflect any criticism that might come one's way for having the gall in listing a director/screenwriter for the film and not just an action choreographer! Watch it if you're in the mood to satiate a craving for blood, gore & guts - not if you seek food for thought...",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Erm...,"Resident Evil: Extinction follows on from the previous 2 RE films, although set some years after the events of RE. Apocalypse. The setting is a post-apocalyptic earth inhabited predominately by zombie mutations, with a few human survivors fighting their way through life.The difference with this film from the 2 before it is that it suffers from little plot, being more than slightly rushed towards the end to fit what plot there is into it and stretches far too much of what isn't needed. Each of the films have there own flaws but this one is weighed down by a hefty chunk of exposition and 'story' which is mainly not required i.e. most of the first 45 minutes of the film, which sets the tone to slow and laborious rather than atmospheric or action packed.What action there is though, is good. The monsters are OK (certainly better looking than 'Nemesis' from the last film, who was essentially just a giant cartoon) and the acting is... there. What suffers though, is the plot. More so, the lack of it. Without revealing anything, some parts rely too heavily on the first film for ideas and most of it seems to be giving George A. Romero's ""Day of the Dead"" more than just a nod and wink.All this said, it isn't a bad film. It has a violent charm and some good effects and action and a couple of, albeit predicable, jumpy moments. However, so much could have been done that wasn't, so I see this as a somewhat missed opportunity for what will probably be the last in this series of films.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Basic stuff from the same writer as always,"I have never thought Resident Evil would get better after the first two disappointments, never have I felt that Paul W.S Anderson would write anything actually good and also never have I ever felt that this franchise is worth the money ploughed into it. My point is I still believe in all those things now after seeing the third instalment in the zombie themed horror series that is based on the video game series of the same name (take note this movie feels like a video game through and through). Our story this time takes us to the deserts of Nevada and the roaming zombies have really got quite far across the US of A and they are in their droves, hungry for some of that good old human flesh. Alice of course is back and is still kicking the hell out of everything and Milla Jovovich who plays her is not all that bad, just lost in a wilderness of crap.The plot whisks you down under the ground and then back into barren wasteland, it's the kind of movie that can really annoy you sometimes because it just goes way too fast. One of the interesting things of this movie is the underground facility also in the desert run by Iain Glen's character Dr Sam Isaacs who actually can feel like a good guy at times until nope, he is definitely the villain. The cast is then buffered up with the likes of Ali Larter who seems to have done roles like this before but cannot escape the generic character she is handling and also the drab lines. Oded Fehr is back to reprise his role as Carlos and he again is in the same sticky situation Larter is in, a character completely and utterly generic.Now the style of Resident Evil is easy to see when watching, fast, lot's of zombies (I mean like loads) and also a load of disposable characters to throw away. We now get to see that style not changed by Russell Mulcahy the guy who made ""Highlander"" and he is known for his fast edits, oh what a perfect choice! The thing is though it isn't Mulcahy who I have a problem with, I mean he is not good but it is Anderson who ruins this. Paul Anderson has kept on making these and they have been consistently poor, he directed the first one and with the second I thought ""Oh good that guys gone now"" but I was wrong, because the man writes the movies. The script is so run of the mill it is just silly, I mean you just know what will happen next and it feels like he just didn't want to have any new perspective on an already well trodden zombie movie path.Listen there will be people who can fully enjoy this for what it is, I mean I admit for some I can see them having great fun, look past some more technical points and you could have a blast. For me personally though I am rather more sad than angry because this is a movie series that has had it's chances and could quite easily make a barely OK movie (which in my eyes is totally fine), but they keep on producing the same old and I fear for the future of this series because if it doesn't step up, then it's destined for the bottom of a movie bin in your local store.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Mad Max 4: Zombies,"Oh dear. First they did RE1 a low production value attempt at turning a genius game into an action movie. When compared with the games there was very similarity, but as a movie it was decent, nothing special but watchable, and Jovovich was a good casting choice.Then RE2, which seemed like more of an attempt to be like the game bringing in Nemesis and making better game-plot references, but again low production value, and still not that rich in plot, but the way it ended definitely was intriguing.Then RE3, geez... Why did they decide to do a Mad Max meets Dawn of the dead? Their only moments that even referenced to the older movies (forget the games) were training scenarios, and flashbacks. There is very little dialogue, and less of it that has any importance, there is little plot, only build up plot for things that never happen, and I am sure are build up for the next sequel which will continue from where this leaves off.Instead of going further into plot and atmosphere, and realising what made the games so amazing, they went further into Hollywood action and gave up on plot and atmosphere entirely. I think it's safe to say, you won't be missing much not seeing this or the next movie.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Fun, but stupid.","My expectations for this film were rather high as I stepped into the theater, simply due to one comment in which Milla Jovovich stated that she hated the second film in the series ('which is horrible. Alright, she has my sympathy here....') but promised that this third installment would be ""rad."" 'Alright...she's probably high, but that didn't make the first movie (8/10) that bad....' Let's start with the positives, eh? The action, that comsumes nearly the entire movie, is quite awesome. With wire work that puts the sh*tfest of a movie that the Matrix to shame, and zombie blood galore, it's a joy to watch mindless beasts act as the dummies on which these characters exact their ass-kicking pleasure. The CG, I have to admit, isn't as good once you see it a second time, but still notable. It's certainly beautiful visually, with the Mexican landscape scoping about, the the torn buildings peeking from beneath the sand, though why Vegas is the only city (when I said Mexican landscape, I meant that it was filmed in Mexico, not taking place there.) still remaining is...well, I can't say anything other than it's stupid.The camera-work is interesting. Russel Mulcahy's use constant use of a moving camera makes for something I haven't seen too many times, and it is certainly fun to watch, though I would have preferred Paul Anderson's stillness, which would have made the film generally creepier and more Resident Evil-eque, speaking from a gamer's perspective.Now to the negative: the whole damn story. The zombie infection spread past the...city that was nuked...and sterilized...and (because, y'know, the governmont wouldn't do anything.) spread to the entire U.S....and then it spread oversea, 'cause viruses can do that, and anybody who came to another country from the zombie-ridden US wouldn't be checked for the virus. And now, 5 years later, the world is turned into a desert because of it. Not as a result of neglect, the film states the virus...made the world wither, and die. Right.And the rest of the story, following this, is equally as ridiculous. It has too many inconsistencies to count--the crows haven't thought to feed on infected flesh for HOW long?--and is almost nonextistant.The acting is alright, though far from perfect. The stereotypical characters really don't provide any means of displaying talent, nor does Mulcahy's insistent approach on making everyone seem ""tough."" Ali Larter, in particular, seems off.So, in conclusion, this is an entertaining, extremely fun to watch, and generally cool-looking...extravaganza of stupidity.I recommend it.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
A change of pace,Resident evil: extinction continues our heroes journey. Apparently nuking raccoon city did nothing to stop the spread of the T virus. The umbrella corporation is still experimenting with the virus and our survivors are still trying to survive. For some reason there's a lot of Alice clones. The locations keep changing like star wars. Alice has ESPN and can disabled satellites in space. Every time Alice twirled her knives I can't help but laugh. All the movies RIP off other better movies like the road warrior. Once again human life means nothing especially when the umbrella security forces kill and get killed. The pacing is better than the first two but that's not saying much. It was filmed in Mexico city and the quality is excellent.

Not an adaptation anymore.

I remember fun characters and tension from the jump on the first two, and yet, on this one, there is only exposition (Umbrella), a bit of nothing with a bit of action (Alice) and the presentation of a bunch of new characters that can barely register on your mind.Once it picks up, it's fine, but the Alice's new powers kind of ruin a bit of the fun and tension and the Umbrella scenes were awful.

"Alice, just what the doctor ordered?","Alice along with a group of survivors attempt to travel to Alaska via Las Vegas to escape a zombie apocalypse.I'm not a player of the Resident Evil games, so all the films including this 3rd instalment are non-bias. I'm not a fan of 'super' zombie's, however, I enjoyed this one more than the second.It was good to see zombies in a desert wasteland setting but the film has a cheap look to it in parts. Oded Fehr, Iain Glen and Mike Epps return, Ali Larter is a welcomed new addition as Claire, but the rest of the acting from the supporting cast isn't too wonderful.Milla Jovovich (despite a odd hair-cut) once again is just what the doctor ordered as Alice who develops her 'powers' throughout. There are plenty of tussles, zombie action, killer birds and it has some great ideas, themes and a surprise electrifying closing.Under Russell Mulcahy direction it has it's moments.
