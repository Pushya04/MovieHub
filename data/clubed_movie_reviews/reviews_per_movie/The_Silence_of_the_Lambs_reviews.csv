"Dr.Lecter, I'd like to see you again...","The Silence of the Lambs runs two hours.Anthony Hopkins appears for little more than sixteen minutes, yet during those minutes he hasn't bored you for a second, not even after the tenth or eleventh viewing. Such is the power of his performance, it's absolutely impossible to forget him.His character, Dr.Hannibal""The Cannibal"" Lecter, is a brutal killer with revolting methods and habits, but he's also very intelligent, charismatic and with good taste(you can interpret that as you like).A clichè by now, but who cares? He still is one of the key elements in this wonderful thriller, which sees Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling asking for Lecter's help to catch another killer.The result is a dangerous yet fascinating relationship between the young, unexperienced FBI-agent and the convicted,but basically omnipotent, psychiatrist.He's a step ahead of everyone all the time, and makes sure everyone notices, with his witty, unforgettable one-liners.If there had to be only one reason to worship this movie, then it would have to be the chemistry between the two leading actors.Never before has a non-sexual man/woman connection been more thrilling.Never before has a film's ending been more unsettling and brilliant and left us asking for more.Best watched with a nice Chianti...P.S. dear film-buffs, have the lambs stopped screaming?",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Concerning Comfort Film,"Admittedly, I am not the most well versed when it comes to cinema and more importantly well thought-out and thorough reviews of cinema however I wanted to attempt to talk about The Silence of the Lambs.This is quite possibly one of my most revisited horror films, I find myself returning to it without boredom quite often. Re-watchablity is something I have noticed to be heavily lacking in the horror genre, something I personally equate to the overuse of the jumpscare, which isn't such a terrible thing but the intended effect wears thin by the third viewing.Silence of the Lambs being a more psychological horror does an immensely interesting job in their depiction of ""deranged"" or mentally ill criminals. Obviously Hannibal himself can become quite alluring given his disturbed charisma alongside the dustings of his criminal, cannibal, activities. His interactions with Clarice are superb and I don't get tired of watching their bizarre chemistry. Plus Jodie Foster did an excellent job as an up and coming FBI student, evidently a small fish in a large, male dominated pond.On that note I think the depictions of her relationships with men in the film are rather well executed. I would love to one day do a deeper more insightful reflection on this film and actually take into account story and cinematography, all factors really but I'll leave it here for now.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Absolutely Brilliant.,"Sweeping all five major Academy Awards (""Oscars"" for Best Movie, Director, Actor, Actress, Screenplay) is quite an accomplishment.  Doing it nearly a year after a film was released is a miracle considering the notoriously short attention span of Oscar voters.  It is a powerful example of how great a movie can be when superb writers, directors, actors, and others work at the top of their craft.`Silence of the Lambs' is  the story of a young FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) who is summoned to help find one serial killer called `Buffalo Bill.' by interviewing another.  Foster's performance is absolutely brilliant.  While Anthony Hopkins receives most of the (well-deserved) praise for his chilling portrayal of incarcerated serial killer `Hannibal the Cannibal' Lector', it is Foster's performance that holds the movie together.  The fear she shows just behind her eyes makes Clarice's outward courage all the more interesting and vulnerable.  This is the perfect way to play the part because it explains Lector's interest in Clarice.  Her only bargaining chip in getting Lector's help is to let him `feed' on her innermost secrets and fears in exchange for his brilliant insights into the psychotic mind.  The title of the movie comes from these exchanges and is very poignant.Director Jonathan Demme is masterful.  There is one scene late in the movie that I will not spoil.  It is one of the most simply brilliant scenes ever staged in a movie.  I don't know if all the credit goes to Demme or the writers, but there is a moment in the film where the suspense builds beautifully to a what seems to be a common movie scene.  However, through skillful timing of the direction, the audiences assumptions are used against them and when the truth is revealed (hint: it involves a doorbell) it is shocking and induced a collective gasp from the audience I saw it with at the theatre.  It set the stage for an edge-of-your seat climax.Do not miss this movie.The movie is incredibly suspenseful and an absolute must see.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Rare to experience a dark n twisted thriller aided by top notch performances, tight script n direction.","I first saw this in the early 90s on a vhs and i still remember how two very old ladies were petrified n blabbering about the movie to my dad and one thing which stayed with me after that conversation was the praising of Hopkins acting by the two grumbling old geezers.I revisited it in the early 2k on a dvd which I own and was in awe by Hopkins mesmerizing performance.Revisited it the third time today but this time with my kids as they are 18 now but my wife is still not agreeable.Everything has been said about this first class thriller n there seems to be nothing left but i jus wanna contribute a lil by praising the performance of Hopkins.In the entire movie, it is Hopkins' screen presence n footage which keeps u glued.His character is charismatic but very dangerous that u don't wanna be rude with him.Some scenes are far fetched but like i said it is the mesmerizing performance by Anthony Hopkins which is the highlight.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Story And A Character That You Can't Forget,"I'll never forget my first viewing of this movie at the theater and will always look back fondly on it for one reason: helping me quit smoking cigarettes.I read the book first, was fascinated by it, and couldn't wait for the film to come out. That was the day I picked to quit smoking and I knew this movie would take my mind off that matter. I was expecting an intense movie and I got it. Little did I realize how well-received this film would be and how it propelled Anthony Hopkins to super-stardom.Although entertaining, this is not always a fun movie to watch, especially with the scenes with Ted Levine who plays the killer, ""Buffalo Bill."" ""Bill"" and his kidnapped young woman are sick and profane people, respectively, and their scenes are very unpleasant. This movie is not for the squeamish with those and other scenes involving the infamous Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins). There also is some extreme crudeness in the jail/dungeon where Lecter and other inmates are held.Jodie Foster is excellent as the FBI agent ""Clarice Starling"" and Scott Glenn is low-key and effective as ""Jack Crawford."" A major part of the film is psychological more than violent as Lecter constantly taunts ""Clarice,"" while she tries her best to manipulate him to help with a case. The by-play between the two is a game in itself.Hopkins, however, is the actor people remember best from this movie. His portrayal of the refined-yet-cannibalistic serial killer-doctor is one viewers will never forget. I've enjoyed watching him in the sequels, too. The looks on his face, his fascinating vocabulary with intelligent sarcasm and frankness, never ceases to entertain.""Silence Of The Lambs"" has turned into a modern-day ""classic.""

My friend was right, this is a great movie. It is so well acted, I couldn't even describe. I loved ""Silence of the Lambs"" and would recommend it to anyone. It's creepy and exciting.

Not a single lamb,"Upon watching, I have to say I was quite surprised by the distinct and rather blasé lack of wooly ruminants that the film's title suggested. Despite thoroughly enjoying the film once I realised it was about psychotic serial killers and not cloud shaped mammals, I cannot help but feel as if I was sold a little short by the title.Josie Foster is outstanding as the FBI agent, I did expect her to play a farm hand however, and Anthony Hopkins may well have delivered his best performance ever as the infamous Hannibal Lector, even though I had him pictured as the charismatic and loveable village vet, helping to heal the broken vocal chords of the widower's flock.Film Review: 10/10

In a Class by Itself,"Brilliant Best Picture of 1991 that never gets old.  ""The Silence of the Lambs"" deals with a young FBI cadet (Oscar-winner Jodie Foster) who is sent to interview a captured madman (Oscar-winner Anthony Hopkins in one of the greatest performances ever on the screen) to find out about a serial killer (Ted Levine) who is stripping the skin from his female victims after they die.  The FBI has had no luck with the case and agent Scott Glenn tries to throw a curve-ball to Hopkins by sending Foster.  Hopkins is a former doctor of Levine and holds the clues to capturing the unknown criminal.  Needless to say the film takes many twists and turns, creating a suspenseful thriller that has no equal.  At the heart of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" are the confrontations between Hopkins and Foster.  They play a complicated chess match of words which results in some of the greatest footage ever captured for the cinema.  Hopkins dominates in spite of the fact he has approximately 17 minutes of time in the film.  This is a film that will wrap itself around you and you will likely never be able to shake some of the key elements you have seen in this amazing masterpiece.  5 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A truly remarkable film,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The PitsRookie FBI agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is assigned to get into the mind of notorious incarcerated serial killer Dr Hannibal 'the Cannibal' Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) to get his evaluation on the elusive Buffalo Bill, a serial killer who's been abducting and killing young women. When a prominent senator's daughter is kidnapped, it becomes a race against time to find her before she is killed and all the while Lecter is playing mind-games with Starling as well as any help he can provide...The first of Thomas Harris's Hannibal novels to be adapted for the screen, only to be followed some years later with some very lacklustre (but inevitable!) follow-ups, despite it's age this remains one of the most effective chillers of modern times. Despite the mainstream appeal of the film, the grainy lighting and laid-back budget give it an art-house feel that sets it apart from other such films that were as successful. The film manages some effectively disturbing scenes that make it a not altogether pleasant viewing experience.Performances wise, in a very early role, a young Foster shows her promise for future roles, with a gripping portrayal of naivety and vulnerability here that is very compelling and convincing, even though there are some plausibility problems with someone as junior as her being assigned to do something like that. Hopkins too is brilliant as Lecter, playing a dangerous man behind bars who's ability to get inside your head and see the things you don't want him to see makes him no less dangerous, if not more so, than if he was on the outside. He's certainly received the most acclaim for his role over the years, but in my humble opinion, he's actually over-shadowed (though only slightly!) by Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill, a truly extraordinary psychopath with an unsettling sexuality disorder that is probably one of the nastiest things ever to be seen in such a mainstream film. As supporting FBI agent Crawford, Scott Glenn is impressive but sort of just faded into DTV land after this film.It's easily one of the most popular films ever made, so it's likely a lot of you are familiar with it already, but with reviews on the so-inferior follow-up films Red Dragon and Hannibal, I thought it only right that I'd finally give this first film a mention. Truly remarkable. *****",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the Greatest Thrillers of all Time.,"The Silence of the Lambs is a masterpiece you cannot miss, it's a masterwork of suspense that blends the elements of horror, crime and psychology into one tight and smooth story. It's only the third film in history to win Academy Awards in all the top five categories: Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, and Adapted Screenplay and that imply something about its technical quality as a film. It features expertise level of craftsmanship in all departments of filmmaking, and takes a huge bonus from the exquisite performances put in by its stellar cast. After all these years The Silence of the Lambs remains in a league of its own and is a perfect exemplification of just how great a movie can become when all the right elements come together and work in perfect harmony to form a complete whole.Based on the novel of the same name, Jodie Foster stars as Clarice Starling, a top student at the FBI's training academy. FBI agent Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) wants Clarice to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a genius psychiatrist who is also a violent psychopath, serving life behind bars for various acts of murder and cannibalism. Crawford believes that Lecter may have insight into a case of a serial killer called Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), that murders and skins his victims and that Starling as an attractive young woman, may be just the bait to make him help with the case.The direction by Jonathan Demme is marvelous, as the film introduces its chilling sense of dread and has the audience on the edge of their seats, from the moment Howard Shore's ominous score hits the screen till the end of the film, especially during the climax with a lot of perfectly crafted suspenseful and nail-biting moments. The editing is perfect as the pace is methodical from start to finish, and each and every sequence is relevant to the story. The cinematography by Tak Fujimoto is fantastic as it fully succeeds into creating a very dark and brooding atmosphere that captivates as well as terrorize the audience, while also exhibiting excellent camera work that makes heavy use of close-ups which increase the creepiness and tension along with displaying an optimal color palette and minimal lightning from start to finish, which further enhances the darker ambience the story was aiming for. Moreover, the production design team has done a magnificent work as every set piece is meticulously crafted, richly detailed and very well-lit. The script by Ted Tally, also packs a very well structured and tight plot, every character has a well-defined arc, all the themes are smartly addressed, the attention to detail is quite impressive, and the complete story and narrative are perfect.The performances are incredible. Jodie Foster as Clarice is absolutely brilliant and gives an impeccable performance as a woman who is desperately trying to forget her painful past and yet at the same time tries to prove her worth in a male dominant world. Anthony Hopkins as the genius psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer Hannibal Lecter is the perfect amalgamation of charisma, high intelligence and destructive violence, and gives a bone-chilling and memorable performance that will stand the passage of time as one of the absolute best. The small amount of screen time that Hopkins is given is a definitive testament to his acting capabilities, as with such an elegant and minimal performance, he solidifies himself as one of the most iconic villains of all time. Due to the charisma and electrifying chemistry between the two actors every scene they share becomes an instant classic.In conclusion, the Silence of the Lambs is one of the greatest films ever made and a masterwork of brilliant direction, smart screenplay, splendid camerawork, tight editing, marvelous score and exquisite performances, that cemented the legacy of both Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster by engraving their iconic characters into the annals of cinema. The film absolutely deserves all the accolades and recognition it gets, for both its contributions to cinema and the immense impact it had on pop culture. Jonathan Demme's magnum opus is an outstanding achievement in genre filmmaking that has inspired and influenced countless thrillers since its release, and is not only the quintessential suspense and psychological horror film but also an ingenious observation of humanity's dark and violent nature and a masterpiece that every film lover must see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
It's a classic!,"There is little doubt that the most memorable aspect of The Silence of the Lambs is Anthony Hopkins' incomparable performance as Lecter. Taking over for Brian Cox, who was effective, but not especially memorable, as the good doctor in 1986's Manhunter, Hopkins instantly makes the role his own, capturing and conveying the charismatic essence of pure evil. To his dying day, no matter how many roles he plays in the interim, Hopkins will forever be known for this part. (It is a credit to Hopkins' ability as an actor that this part did not result in stereotyping. His post-Silence career has been greatly varied, with roles as widely diverse as a stodgy butler in Merchant-Ivory's The Remains of the Day and an action hero in The Edge.) I can throw out any number of superlatives, but none of them do justice to this chilling performance, which I labeled as the best acting work of the '90s. Want to feel the icy fingers of terror stroke your heart? Watch this mixture of brilliant eloquence and inhuman cruelty. As portrayed by Hopkins, Hannibal is both a suave, cultured gentleman and an unspeakable fiend. He is gracious and monstrous at the same time. (Hopkins also provided one of the most quotable lines in recent film history with ""I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti"", which was followed by an inimitable slithering slurp.)",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

It lands in the top 100 of several lists at the very least, and remains the only horror film to ever win a Best Picture Academy Award.

Just one word for this movie #masterpiece.,"A psychological crime thriller, fully agree to say it wow on the basis of raw crime scenes of brutal killings and FBI investigation of a psycho killer to catch another!The story is presented simple and not too much complicated by the director and writer i.e. To catch a psychopath killer with the help of another psycho killer who is behind the bars.Although the story is not about too much mind games, it's just of some psycho killings in which the director created some ruthless killing and postmortem scenes which will be very difficult to see if someone fears to see the blood.Technically it is a well-crafted movie where the camera is used very beautifully to capture closeup shots. If we talk about acting performances, every character did a great job.Overall its will be a delight to watch this crime thriller in which viewers will not have to put their mind.

Very Effective Thriller But Ultimately Overrated,"It's impossible to comment on SILENCE OF THE LAMBS as being a mere film . Its release was a watershed in popular culture and has influenced a myriad of imitations that are far too numerous to mention . Much of this success is down to director Jonathan Demme who has made the film so effective by coming up with the strikingly simple idea of filming everything in dim lighting which gives SILENCE a moody and brooding atmosphere that was absent from movies in the previous decade . Ironically enough this is as typical of 90s film making as MANHUNTER was of 80s movies . Howard Shore's score also helps the proceedings and Jodie Foster gives a sublime nuanced performance as vulnerable heroine Clarice Starling . Watch the scenes closely when Clarice is in the company of men , don't you get the feeling she has a phobia about the male of the species . Is she a victim of sexual abuse in her childhood ? A lesbian ? We never find out but Foster's performance is multi layered and it's a pity this aspect is never explored in HANNIBAL which sadly deletes this aspect to ClariceSadly SILENCE was released with a tidal wave of hype which the film doesn't live up to . Who can forget the stories that upon seeing this at the cinema certain audience members wanted armed escorts back to their cars ! I'm sorry but despite being a good thriller it's not that good and I fail to see how people were turned into quivering jellies unable to sleep with the lights off . I'm also afraid to say that much of the awards heaped upon the film aren't that well deserved either . Foster deserved the Oscar as did the film and possibly Demme too but did Ted Tally for his adapted screenplay ? All he seems to have done is to copy the best bits of Harris's novel wholesale into the screenplay without making an effort to improve anything . and i'll probably be accused of sacrilege but the more times I see this film the more times I ask myself how did Hopkins win the Oscar for Best Actor ? I don't even think Hopkins should have qualified for the Best Actor category since the role isn't on screen long enough and his performance is slightly hammy . Hannibal as played by Hopkins resembles something along the lines of a paedophile rather than a serial killer who has maimed , murdered and munched on adults . Despite having some reservations of Brian Cox as Hannibal in MANHUNTER you do believe his burly presence does have the physical strength to overpower his victims , not so HopkinsI know it's very difficult , perhaps even impossible , but the best way to enjoy this movie is to erase from your mind the fact that it's one of only three movies to have picked up the Oscar in all five main categories , the fact that it made headlines about being the most terrifying film committed to celluloid , and the fact that it stands as the 28th best movie ever on this website . It is a very good thriller but one that is ultimately disappointing after hearing of the hype surrounding it",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Some Careless Stitching,"Heaps of praise have been given to this multiple Oscar winner by Critics and Fans alike. It is sometimes disturbing, sometimes terrifying, and sometimes the Characters are engaging. Sometimes.The Film is inconsistent in both style and substance. There are way too many close ups. After a few, the intended uneasiness is lost. Most of the sets are attractively unappealing and does give the sense of a forbidden place.A striking performance from Hopkins but some of his cryptic inclusions using anagrams are uninteresting and at worst confusing and make no or little sense of irony. Jodie Foster seems forcing it, especially when asked to reveal some secret recalling the title of the Book and Movie. There are also some less than brilliantly enticing lectures from Hannibal about coveting and a scribbled note that is laughably sophomoric and we're off to catch the truly creepy Buffalo Bill.Overall it adds up to be less than it seems. Some clever stuff but it is carelessly sewed together and with some tugging starts to unravel. Overrated, but influential, with some disturbing and dank scenes that make this a bumpy, irritating, and not quite completely satisfying ride to the Dark Side.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The story from start to finish is enthralling, and the script is tense and thought-provoking.The Silence of the Lambs is wonderfully acted as well. Jodie Foster is the one who holds the film together and her performance here is one of her most excellent, and I mustn't forget Ted Levine who is very chillingly effective as Buffolo Bill.

The granddaddy of all serial killer flicks,"THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is, quite simply, a breathtaking movie. It's the granddaddy of all serial killer flicks, a film that even the almost-as-good SE7EN can only aspire to, a movie that gets into the mind and soul of a serial killer like few others. It inspired a huge sub-genre of similar movies that came out during the 1990s and 2000s, and it's up there with Hitchcock's PSYCHO as one of the most gripping looks at the subject matter of all time.Where to begin? There's a pitch-perfect Jodie Foster, gradually leading us into the depths of the storyline as the naive FBI agent, and the oft-overlooked Ted Levine who excels as the supremely skin-crawling Buffalo Bill. Of course, the film is dominated by Anthony Hopkins, giving the best and most memorable performance of his career in just 16 minutes of screen time. Hopkins chills you to the bone in this, and Jonathan Demme's direction is a perfect match for his talents.The storyline is engaging, ably mixing the criminal investigation strands with scenes involving the killers themselves. There are gory and monstrous set-pieces which make your flesh crawl while watching, yet it's all rather restrained and intellectual, a surprise given the subject matter.

To me it is really Demme's work here that separates this film from the pack. Anyway you slice it, you must see this monster if you're interested in serial killer films much at all.

Her concerns regarding her background and the flashbacks seemed slight this time around. The wrap up regarding Buffalo Bill character seemed a little convenient here. As for the dialogue it still mostly worked but some of it did come off as trite and while not exactly dated, just ordinary.

Perfectly executed dramatic thriller,"The Silence of the Lambs, having accomplished the rare feat of winning all five of the major Academy Award categories, is a remarkable achievement in filmmaking.  Gruesome, pulpish material was transformed by dedicated participants on all levels of production, and a film that would have failed in the hands of many others wound up becoming a modern masterpiece.  Taut direction and a superb screenplay might be the best arguments for the film's power, but the flashiest are certainly delivered in the bravura performances of Hopkins and Foster.  Their interplay -- and remember, they only share a handful of scenes together -- is nothing short of riveting.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Taut film-making that results in a chilling and influential psychological thriller,"The late Gene Siskel hated ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" thinking of it as being far too gruesome and distasteful and as having zero originality to it. Roger Ebert gave the 3.5 out of 4 stars, saying that he did enjoy the film but that some scenes were lacking, such as the ending.Siskel missed the point. The chill from ""The Silence of the Lambs"" doesn't come from revolutionary originality, which it doesn't have. The chill of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is in how it maximizes fear and suspense in a plot that one could simply describe as ""police on the hunt for a serial killer."" It is here where ""The Silence of the Lambs"" set the bar; it takes a B-movie concept and raises it to the level of a taut A-level thriller.The plot has the FBI on the hunt for a serial killer known as ""Buffalo Bill"" (played by Ted Levine). Stuck, the lead investigator (played by Scott Glenn) wants to get the perspective of another serial killer, to try and see inside the psychotic mind. He recruits the young FBI trainee Clarice Starling (played by Jodie Foster) to talk to the brilliant and cannibalistic psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter (played by Anthony Hopkins). Lecter agrees to help Starling, but only if she will grant him the sadistic pleasure of allowing him to see inside her mind.Even though the plot is about Buffalo Bill, with Lecter only having 16 minutes on screen in a 2-hour movie, Lecter and Starling are way more interesting and end up being the driving force for the film. In many films, an excellent performance by the villain can steal the show away from the hero. (Tim Burton's ""Batman,"" featuring a brilliant performance by Jack Nicholson as The Joker, is a prime example of this.) In ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" we have strong performances by both of the lead actors. Hopkins' Lecter is clearly everybody's favorite character, but Foster's performance as Starling is powerful enough to not get eclipsed by Hopkins.Not getting eclipsed is something of a theme for this film. Our heroine is not trying to be heroic. Starling is strong and courageous and could kick anyone's butt, and yet she comes across as vulnerable. She is a woman in a man's world and everywhere she goes, there is a sense of being dominated. She is 5'3"" in a film where most other characters are over 6' tall. (The camera often skillfully has Starling occupying only the lower half of the frame; seeing so much space above her head makes her look shorter and more vulnerable.) Her black hair (which is different from Foster's natural light brown) makes her appear paler than she really is. Other characters are always hitting on her. She always whispers and is always giving a nervous smile. Even her slight Southern accent gives her a ""country girl"" appeal that helps the audience identify with her. Starling is an FBI agent-in-training and is clearly quite skilled at handling dangerous situations, but she still shares our vulnerabilities. As a result of this, her fears are our fears. This is the true skill of Jodie Foster's performance; she manages to play Starling as a woman of great strength and vulnerability at once.Credit should also go to the film-makers. One strong point is their choice to only be selectively gruesome. This is one key difference between ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and garden-variety serial killer movies. The latter often derive their scares by showing incredibly brutal images and portraying utterly disgusting scenarios. Fear is generated by the audience's own horrified reaction to what is being shown on screen. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" does not give in to that temptation though. It casually shows us several rather gruesome images to get us nervous, but then keeps some of the most disturbing stuff cleverly off-camera. Of course, this serves to only make them scarier; what could be so gruesome that not even this creepy film is willing to show it on camera?I do have criticisms. My main complaint is that Buffalo Bill is a lightweight who left me longing for the much more interesting and menacing Hannibal Lecter. Buffalo Bill is sick, twisted, and downright nauseating, but he also is a coward, who has to resort to trickery and gadgetry to make himself formidable. Lecter, on the other hand, has all the tools he needs right there in his brain. He is the smartest character in the film and he knows it and he loves it. He is so charismatic that he can enter the mind of anyone, no matter how hard they resist. This makes Lecter scary even when he is off-camera. Buffalo Bill is not really all that scary even when he's on camera; he's more just plain gross.The thrill of this movie is psychological. We don't feel thrilled because of cool action sequences or original plot ideas but rather because of the fear that we can relate to and the mind games that Lecter plays. Something of a void is left in scenes in the latter half of the film, where Lecter is absent. (Here, I agree with Ebert.) Nonetheless, Foster's performance makes up for that. Even in the final showdown with Buffalo Bill, the thrill is still there because we feel Starling's fear, even though the audience has not been particularly scared of Buffalo Bill up until now. (Here, I disagree with Ebert, who feels the showdown is lacking.)""The Silence of the Lambs"" is thrilling and chilling. The main villain is a lightweight, but the secondary villain is among the most menacing and evil in cinema history. I think that after we walk away from this film, we somehow are left with the feeling that, at least for those 2 hours, Hannibal Lecter managed to get inside our own minds as well.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Thrilling and Chilling,"I just finished watching The Silence of the Lambs, and wow, it was really good. This movie had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. It's a thriller about an FBI trainee named Clarice Starling who is trying to catch a serial killer named Buffalo Bill. She gets help from another killer, Dr. Hannibal Lecter, who is very smart and really creepy.Jodie Foster, who plays Clarice, did an amazing job. She made me feel like I was right there with her, trying to solve the case. And Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter was just incredible. He was so intense and scary, even though he didn't have a lot of screen time. Every time he was on screen, I couldn't look away.The story itself was really interesting. It wasn't just about catching a killer; it was about getting inside the minds of these characters. The way Clarice and Hannibal talked to each other was so tense and full of suspense. I also liked how the movie showed Clarice's struggles as a woman in a male-dominated field. It made her character even more relatable and strong.The music and cinematography were also on point. The dark and eerie atmosphere added a lot to the creepy vibe of the movie. The scenes in Hannibal's cell were especially well done, making you feel trapped and uncomfortable, just like Clarice.Overall, The Silence of the Lambs is a fantastic movie. It's scary, smart, and keeps you guessing until the very end. If you like thrillers or psychological movies, you should definitely watch it. I can see why it's considered a classic. This movie is going to stick with me for a long time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A Feast of Chills and Charisma,"Directed by Jonathan Demme, The Silence of the Lambs is a film that walks the fine line between fascination and repulsion with all the grace of a serial killer at a masquerade ball. First and foremost, the film's accolades are as numerous as the bones in a crypt - five major Academy Awards to be precise. It's a cinematic experience that's impossible to ignore, much like the eerie whispers of Hannibal Lecter himself.But what truly sets this film apart are the meticulous details. The way it lovingly depicts the art of skinning humans, the delicate ballet of butterfly chrysalises in a room filled with decaying corpses, and the unsettling sight of a severed head submerged in a jar - it's like a gruesome culinary show for the morbidly inclined. All these scenes could both send shivers down the spines and elicit eerie laughter from fans of the horror genre. Who knew that watching someone prepare a meal could be so riveting?And as if that weren't enough, The Silence of the Lambs introduces not just one, but two extraordinarily captivating serial killers! It's a marvel (albeit a macabre one) that Dr. Hannibal Lecter, the cannibalistic genius with a taste for the finer things in life, is portrayed with such malevolence and danger while exuding a magnetic, irresistibly seductive aura. He manages to bewitch not only the main protagonist, the heroic Clarice Starling, but also the audience itself. Hannibal's charm is so potent that it could make you forget that he's one bite away from serving your liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti. But who could resist those fiery, almost crimson eyes and that sinister grin, filled with rows of tiny, tantalizing teeth?In The Silence of the Lambs, horror, charm, and an unsettling sense of allure perform a deadly waltz. It's a captivating dance, much like how Clarice Starling steps through danger with the grace of a deer in a lion's den. This dance seduces you even as it sends shivers down your spine, and makes you question your own sanity for enjoying it, much like relishing a slice of forbidden fruit in the garden of the bizarre.The Silence of the Lambs is a testament to the brilliance of its characters and their complexity. It's a film that plunges you into the darkest recesses of the human psyche while simultaneously drawing you irresistibly closer to the abyss. Enjoy it like it's a gourmet meal; just don't forget to check under your bed for any unexpected dinner guests after watching it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

overhyped 90s movie,It was not bad. Mainly an over hyped.The pacing felt like a distorted quilt.The whole movie was saturated with grainy character development. I was unsure of the direction this movie wanted to take. Felt all over the place.The jail scene and the ending are the only parts worth watching.Main character was subpar. Not bad and not outstanding either. I didn't care for her past. It's the usual only the main character goes through trauma and flash backs as they try to solve a problem.Hopkins did very well but this whole movie is still overrated.

A thrilling must see,"I just saw, for the second or third time, this cinematographic masterpiece, during an « UGC culte » evening, in Paris. The list of the Big Five Academy Award winners is short. There are currently three of them, in nine decades:It Happened One Night (1934),One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975)and ...The Silence of the Lambs (1991). This is not really surprising, this film being excellent, endowed with a script skillfully elaborated byThomas Harris, with an irreproachable casting includingAnthony Hopkins,Jodie FosterandScott Glenn. In addition, the directorJonathan Demmedelivers a work obviously enjoying an admirable preparatory work.Without unduly spoiling the script, if you have not seen it yet, by the greatest fluke: a psychopath known as the Buffalo Bill sows terror in the Middle West by kidnapping and murdering young pulpy women, after partially or completely skinning them. Clarice Starling, a young FBI agent, is in charge of interviewing Hannibal Lecter, a well-known former psychiatrist who has also the characteristic of a truly intelligent psychopath focused on cannibalism. Hannibal Lecter is able to provide Clarice Starling with providential information about Buffalo Bill . But he agrees to help her only in exchange for information about the young woman's private life.

Weirdly enjoyable!,"I believe this film occupies a unique niche and could be classified within a specific genre of its own. It expertly blends various elements of horror, seamlessly incorporating aspects of thriller, psychological, gothic, and crime genres of horror. While the psychological elements are undoubtedly the most dominant, the other themes complement the film in a distinct way that feels just right.I must commend Anthony Hopkins for his portrayal of Hannibal. His performance was nothing short of horrific, adding an eerie and dark undertone to the movie. The surrounding environment subtly reinforces the gothic themes, enhancing the overall atmosphere of the film.Overall, this was a highly enjoyable experience, and I am certain I will rewatch it to unravel more of its mysteries.

Great story,"The Silence of the Lambs runs two hours. Anthony Hopkins appears for little more than sixteen minutes, yet during those minutes he hasn't bored you for a second, not even after the tenth or eleventh viewing. Such is the power of his performance, it's absolutely impossible to forget him. His character, Dr. Hannibal""The Cannibal"" Lecter, is a brutal killer with revolting methods and habits, but he's also very intelligent, charismatic and with good taste(you can interpret that as you like). A clichè by now, but who cares? He still is one of the key elements in this wonderful thriller, which sees Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling asking for Lecter's help to catch another killer. The result is a dangerous yet fascinating relationship between the young, unexperienced FBI-agent and the convicted,but basically omnipotent, psychiatrist. He's a step ahead of everyone all the time, and makes sure everyone notices, with his witty, unforgettable one-liners. If there had to be only one reason to worship this movie, then it would have to be the chemistry between the two leading actors.

Demme's direction was almost flawless and kept the viewer feeling disturbed throughout the film with his use of uncomfortable situations (ie- someone following you in the dark, being stuck in a well, being locked in a room with no way out). What struck me most about this film was the glorification of Hannibal which seemed to portray him as a good guy even while the viewer knows about his murders, cannibalism and mind-manipulating.

Class Act,"With Silence of the Lambs comes some much needed recognition for the horror genre.  It is a first-rate production all around.  It boasts a witty and suspenseful script based on the Thomas Harris novel, full of great lines. It has marvelous direction from Demme.  Demme creates suspense very well throughout and uses some great directorial shots such as the twin frames of Clarice ringing a doorbell and the FBI men breaking into a home.  The two lead actors won oscars for their performances...each deserved.  Foster is very good in her role, but it is Anthony Hopkins that literally lights up the screen with his complex portrayal of a complex serial killer.  Hopkins does the seemingly impossible. He frightens you with his outrageousness and yet illicts some pity/compassion(albeit not a lot) for his situation.  He says his lines with reservedness when needed and brashness when needed.  The rest of the cast is also quite good with Anthony Heald a standout as a unethical, petty doctor in charge of Hopkins.  Of course the story of the other killer is very very chilling as well.

The Silence of the Lambs (1991) Review,"Rewatched February 27th, 2021A favorite of mine for years and a worthy Beat Picture winner at the Oscars, Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins give the performances of their careers. Now whether or not you agree with category placement for Hopkins, which I've for years agreed as leading due to importance to plot but after this viewing I'm actually seeing it more as supporting, his along with Foster's are Oscar deserving performances. Ted Levine is also incredible as Buffalo Bill and was deserving of awards attention but sadly did not. The screenplay by Ted Tally had incredible dialogue especially between Foster and Hopkins and allowed them to showcase their talents. The film would not have been as successful without masterful direction by Jonathan Demme. As far as techs go, editing is top notch. It's no surprise to see that the costume design was completed by 12 times Oscar nominated with 4 wins Colleen Atwood, because her work combined with the production design by Kristi Zea and Karen O'Hara brings magic to the screen captured by the exquisite cinematography of Tak Fujimoto.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Rewatching The Silence of the Lambs, I'm once again struck by why this film remains such a standout. Jonathan Demme's adaptation of Thomas Harris's 1988 novel holds the esteemed honour of being one of only three films to sweep the Big Five Academy Awards. After watching it again, I fully understand why-it's an absolute masterclass in suspense, character, and storytelling.Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins both deliver performances that are nothing short of stellar. Foster's portrayal of Clarice Starling still feels raw, determined, and vulnerable in all the right ways. I'm consistently drawn into her internal struggle as she navigates the grisly world she's thrown into. Hopkins, of course, is unforgettable as Dr Hannibal Lecter. Even knowing what's coming, his chilling yet charming presence still manages to create a satisfying unease. The way he plays with silence and stillness adds so much to the tension.Demme's direction is incredibly tight, balancing character-driven drama with psychological horror. I really appreciate how he uses close-ups and framing to create intimacy and unease, making me feel like I'm part of these tense conversations. The screenplay does a fantastic job of translating Harris's book to the screen with a clear reverence for the source material. It's faithful but never afraid to make smart adjustments to enhance the cinematic experience.I love how the film doesn't rely on cheap scares but instead builds its horror through character and psychology. It's the kind of thriller that stays with you long after the credits roll, and I'm always impressed by how well it holds up over time.The Silence of the Lambs is more than deserving of its accolades. It's a timeless thriller that still feels fresh, with performances and craftsmanship that set the bar for everything that followed. An absolute classic.FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-rayVIDEO: 8.0

Fiction when the Non-fiction is too Raw,"Thomas Harris is my favorite novelist when it comes to bringing his novel to film. Michael Mann's Manhunter was exceptional and William Peterson created a role that would later rule television in CSI. Great casting and effective direction brought this novel to life setting it apart from other serial killer films. Hopkins is great, but this was more an extraordinary role and character, rather than stellar acting. Jodie Foster, who is always good, is just right in her understated performance but again I attribute this to Harris' exception character development.

An overall compelling thriller film,"""Silence of the Lambs"" was released in 1991 and inspired several thriller films, as it has become a classic. However, it also has some graphic violence, so it's not for everyone.I have to say, although I liked the movie, I appreciate the movie ""Seven"" (stylized as ""Se7en"") much more because it was more twisty, even more tense and visually even more stylish and unique. I actually consider ""Seven"" the greatest thriller film ever made and also one of the best movies ever made. But that doesn't mean ""Silence of the Lambs"" is a bad movie! In fact, I find it really outstanding in many ways.Jonathan Demme's direction is brilliant, one of the film's strengths. Another thing that makes the film excellent is the acting of Anthony Hopkins. But the other performances are also good, for example Jodie Foster is also really great in her role of Clarice Starling. The characters are multi-dimensional and interesting.

This must be the most overrated movie in Hollywood history,"This film has a silly premise, a lousy script, an implausibility factor of about +100 and a dreadful performance by Anthony Hopkins.  It's the last point that I'll mention about first:  has a more pretentious, breathy performance ever been seen on film before (outside of the Richard Burton oeuvre)?  As for plausibility:  can you imagine the FBI sending a trainee to interview a serial killer, seeking information about another serial killer on the loose?  That was a major flaw in the (also overrated) novel.  I guess it's easier to write about, or make a movie with, a younger woman who's still apt to get all scared-ified and emotional and who doesn't have those annoying crows-feet.  The script is terrible, too--it tries to present Hannibal Lecter as being some kind of 'psychic vampire'.  Witness Hopkins' expression after Jodie Foster tells him her tale of lamb-napping woe--like a famished person who's just been given a good meal.  Give me a break!  And don't tell me that the FBI couldn't have made a connection between the missing skin pieces on the dead girls' bodies and figured out what the loony-tunes they were chasing was doing.  It takes Jodie Foster's character seeing a dress pattern with darts on it to make the connection.  What a group of dim bulbs.  And they wait until HOW MANY young women are killed before they scratch their heads and say, ""Hmmmm, maybe the killer knew one of the victims!""  How did this stupid waste of celluloid ever garner any critical praise?

"Believe me, you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head","Once upon a crime, Hannibal Lecter was a manipulative psycho-killer compensating for his incarceration by messing with people's minds. Then Hannibal happened and he suddenly turned into a dandy anti-hero... Watching The Silence Of The Lambs again really puts things into perspective. Jonathan Demme's astute adaptation of Thomas Harris' last good book entwines the horror and detective genres to enduringly shocking effect, while Anthony Hopkins' Lecter and Jodie Foster's Starling fizz up an unsettling chemistry that was utterly lacking in the sequel.I haven't seen a movie this perfectly wrapped in a while. I recently re-watched it and it blew me away and it only gets better the more you see it.The performances from everyone are great. Foster sold every scene she was in. But, of course, Hopkins stole every scene he was in and was a powerful anti hero who was scary even when concealed because you know his mind is working at every second. Always planning and he's rarely wrong. His escape was an amazing scene. Levine gives a suitably scary performance but just doesn't stand up to the greatness of Foster and Hopkins.All the characters main characters are deep people are deep people with clear motivations. The police officers are the complete contradiction to this who abuse their power to do what they believe is right, and end up being wrong.

A Potpourr of Vestiges Review: Hannibal - The Cannibal,"Silence of the Lambs is a quintessence of a profound character study and a rare and vivid demonstration of an actor's subtle brilliance and his improvisation in manifestation of a nebulous entity (Lecter), almost single-handedly immortalizing it and in the process elevating himself to a position of unqualified envy and ubiquitous acclaim. In fact, one is likely to suffer, either from inarticulacy or verbosity while describing Anthony Hopkins portrayal of sadistically sophisticated Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Lecter's trademark, his wide open glacial eyes, devoid of any emotion, not only makes him deviously equanimous, but also egregiously peculiar. The fast, slurping-type sound invented by Hopkins that Lecter does, is as fascinating as it is chilling and Lecter's infamous ""Good evening, Clarice"", is as enthralling as it is vicious. Anthony Hopkins's performance is the shortest ever and the most memorable to win an Oscar in the leading category.Hopkins as Lecter, is incontrovertibly and incredibly at the top of his game and it is his brilliance that gets the best out of the other actors, especially Jodie Foster. In fact, it won't be a hyperbole, that Anthony Hopkins's portrayal of cannibalistic Hannibal Lecter in Silence of the Lambs and more so in its sequel, Hannibal (which is my favorite of the series, as the story completely revolves around Lecter, giving him more exposure), is one of the best, the world of cinema has ever seen or offered. In spite of having some of the most gruesomely disturbing and viciously graphic sequences, Silence of the Lambs, is one of the most decorated and enthralling movies of all time. A must watch for avid fans and eclectic viewers.http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
FBI agent-in-training Clarice Starling on assignment enlists the help of confined psychopath and psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter to capture a serial killer he is familiar with.,"""The Silence of the Lambs"" deserves its recognition as a classic and one of only three movies in history to win the ""big 5"" Oscars. The protagonists were brilliantly portrayed. Hopkins very much adds to the story through his creepy performance. His articulate speech and refined southern English accent were jarring as he rarely blinked and calmly expressed his cannibalism. The way Lecter masterfully picked at Starling's insecurities while she tried to get his assistance in finding Buffalo Bill made the character all the more terrifying. Foster, unsurprisingly, is extremely believable as a young woman who wants to prove her worth for her future occupation by tackling the ambitious case. The directing flows smoothly. Great use of extreme close-ups are used to see the actors' emotions and connect with them. The flashbacks were introduced before they seamlessly illustrated the effects Lecter's prodding conversations has on Clarice, making these scenes easy to follow and making Foster's character more of a protagonist. On a side note, I appreciated the conscientious effort made to include a diverse cast in the film, with African- Americans featured prominently in important secondary roles. With that being said, I did feel that the movie was not perfect. The way Clarice finds a lead as to where Buffalo Bill is hiding seemed far- fetched to me. I felt the case could have been further developed before Starling reached the conclusion she arrived to. Moreover, I felt that Buffalo Bill could have used more of a back-story than what is given in order to increase the depth of his character. While some insight is given by Lecter, it is not enough to understand what caused the gender/identity issues that drive Bill to kill. This made his character seem a bit two- dimensional as the antagonist of the film. In contrast, I found Lecter's character rich in depth, as he would be considered a bad guy unless he was helping to find another mentally ill murderer. His character does not hold back his psychopathic ways or complete, self-centered disregard for the well- being of others if it doesn't suit his needs. All in all, this was an incredibly well done film that could probably only be improved if not for time restraints.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Genre Defining Psychological Horror,"The Silence of The Lambs as a novel adaptation and stars Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins plus a strong support cast. This is one of those rare generational movies that has morphed into pop culture and is ubiquitous (and notorious) beyond the boundaries of cinema.Released in 1991, it has to be admitted that it is not as shocking or terrifying as it once was, as we as a generation have become desensitised to the topic of serial killers through mass media exposure. However, even 33 years cannot diminish the power of this movie and most notably the harrowing portrayal of Dr. Hannibal Lecter by Anthony Hopkins.Hopkins is outstanding and terrifying in equal measure as the highly intelligent and psychopathic doctor, playing him as still, cold and calculating which is somehow scarier than some outwardly unhinged maniac. It's a truly superb portrayal of a killer that has since redefined how such a character is portrayed in cinema.Foster, though also superb, is asked to overplay the gender role of being a (young) woman in a male dominated world, and as such is portrayed as weaker than she should be, to reinforce this stereotype (as a highly trained psychologist I'm pretty certain she would not fold so easily upon meeting even such a monster as Dr. Lecter), but this is a minor quibble that is only highlighted through time and changing gender roles in greater society.This is a truly great movie with performances and a story that is clever but not too over the top, combining to make some really special cinema and will make you rethink your meal wine selection choices for many years to come!9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Good, But Overrated","This movie was a MASSIVE letdown. I've heard so many great things about it that I thought I was in for the best movie of my life. It was not.The ONLY thing that kept it afloat was the acting/casting. Hannibal Lector is truly an incredible character (with also the coolest name ever), and Anthony Hopkins absolutely nailed it. He was of course the stand out, but all of the others were fantastic too.With the exception of this, there was nothing else to the movie that really stood out to me. I did, however, find myself confused a few times.Overall, I don't know that l'd recommend it. I have no idea how it became such a classic, but to each their own I guess.

Silence of the Clams,"Sorry, but... I'm with Gene Siskel on this one, though I didn't dislike it as much. It was a rather well acted film, but the glowing reviews made me expect too much... When I sat down in the cinema, I said, 'Scare me.' The movie went along. I said, 'Scare me.' The climax came. 'Scare me.' The movie was about to end. 'Scare me.' And then it was over. I didn't find it scary at all... I mean... Boyz In The Hood should've won the Best Picture Oscar... That one had a heart. This one...

This movie takes a real bite out of you!,"The normal human being's fear of being attacked, bitten open in a violently impersonal manner and then taken in as food is as old as the first human being's shattering witness of such a primordial act. In the thousands of years of human evolution, intelligence has armored [most of us] against predations of that horrible sort. But even more incomprehensible is an attack, for mere hunger's sake, by one human being upon another! When first we see Dr. Hannibal Lecter, his madness is merely the subject of comment, responsible or otherwise. As we view him [uncomfortably] from the safety of a theatre seat, we can only imagine the deep wells of need which forced him to savage his fellow human beings in this manner, and this makes all the more terrible the awful scene in the Memphis courthouse. Into all this walks Clarice Starling, her innocence and anxiety both touching and troubling. She is essentially tricked into taking the assignment to ""interview"" Lecter by her superior, Jack Crawford, who callously deems her expendable. She somehow summons the rural courage of her youth, forged from the furnace of her weary sufferings, and becomes the blank sheet for both Crawford's and Lecter's amusement. As the result of being pulled in opposite directions in the murderous tug-of-war between Lecter and Crawford, Starling is almost totally alone in the film. In spite of her genuine liking for Aredlia Mapp, Starling's isolation is nearly so complete as to be claustrophobic. Director Jonathan Demme's finely-nuanced work here is well served. Her enlightenment takes place primarily in darkness, whether the setting is Lecter's cell in the dungeon, or whether the apotheosis takes place in the demon's lair. There are almost no likeable characters in the film save Starling. This makes it easy to root for her to overcome the furies which have pursued her since her tenth year. Clarice's predatory instincts are to bring a vicious psychopath within the scope of punishment. In sharp contrast, the other main characters in the film are possessed of predatory natures of a baser, more primitive kind, whether it is Dr. Frederick Chilton's need for sex, or Crawford's need for control, or Lecter's need to destroy for pleasure. The music score by Howard Shore is reminiscent, in a eerie way, of Bernard Herrmann's work in Psycho. Shore's opening theme foreshadows the loneliness and desperation of Starling's dual quest, which is to kill both beasts: the one without and the one within.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Masterpiece - Greatest Crime Film Ever Made,"Is it a strange thing to say that this is my favorite serial killer movie of all-time? I guess I could put it more politely and say that it's my favorite ""crime"" film of all-time...that's better right? For whatever reason, especially as a young adult, I had a fascination with crime stories - especially serial killer stories. There's just something inherently fascinating to me about a human who has crossed a sacred line of humanity into great evil. What can we do in the face of it? I know I'm not alone here; the history of cinema and television being filled with crime and murder stories demonstrates many of you are fascinated by it too. So what is it about The Silence of the Lambs that makes it stand out from so many of the other crime stories?

I would like to stay more in the performance of Anthony Hopkins that is really majestic and gives the film more quality.Hopkins gets to the skin of his role and makes you to feel that he is a real psycho killer.Also the direction is perfect by Demme and makes the viewers to be absorbed by the fight of the FBI agent Clarice Starling and Dr. Hannibal Lecter.Jodie Foster fairly wins the Academy Award for Best Actress in Leading Role.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Shocking psychological thriller,"The Silence of The Lambs explores the life and mind of Clarice Starling, a female FBI agent who has a lot of issues to deal with. Somehow by fate, she ends up meeting Hannibal Lector, and they strike up a very unusual relationship. The most interesting parts in the movie deal with the 2 of them just talking.The highlight of the movie is obviously Anthony Hopkins' performance. He's delightfully creepy as Hannibal. The whole suspense of the character is thinking he's about to do something violent, since throughout the movie you only hear stories about the terrible things he's done. When he finally does do something, it really pays off because it's one of the scariest and most memorable parts in the movie.The Silence Of The Lambs appeals to many people. That's because it can be viewed from so many angles, and that's why it's become a part of our pop-culture.

Great Movie,This movie is the greatest psychological thriller. It has all the makes of a great serial killer movie as well as twists and turns on plots. The story was written perfectly and the actors performed their best in their roles. I wouldn't change a thing about it except that I would of like to see a newer rendition to this movie. I love the series and which more would be done with it. In my opinion it's a must watch movie along with the prequels and sequels to this movie.

I would recommend everyone to watch all of his movies especially this one.,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Getting A Good Consultant,"It seems as though there is a serial killer out there who's grabbed the daughter of a United States Senator and this guy has zoomed right to the top of FBI's Most wanted. This man's modus operandi is to keep the victims alive for a while before killing them so they're racing against time to find him. Desperate situations call for desperate measures.The desperate measure is, you want to catch a serial killer, bring in one as a consultant. That's why FBI trainee Jodie Foster goes to visit Anthony Hopkins in prison. Hopkins is not just a killer who eats his victims, he's a brilliant psychologist himself with insights maybe no one else has.Of course his price are some cheap insights into Jodie Foster's soul, thrills he probably got when he was in practice.The Silence of the Lambs in less capable hands could have just been another cheap slasher flick. Instead the leads who walked off with the Academy Awards for Best Actor and Best Actress give riveting performances of a sick twisted psycho and a woman who became the biggest feminist icon since Sigourney Weaver by confronting some demons of her own. It's the best work that Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster have ever done and let's not forget the Oscars won by Director Jonathan Demme and the Picture itself for being the Best in 1991.A couple of players who made their marks on television later on also score well here. Anthony Heald who was Buffy the Vampire Slayer's handler plays the psychiatrist in the institute where Hopkins is incarcerated and who Hopkins makes a fool of and says at the end he's far from done with. Also Ted Levine who is Captain Stottlemeyer on Monk plays the serial killer the FBI is trying to catch. Also look for a good performance by Brooke Smith as Levine's potential victim.The Silence of the Lambs with its taut direction and riveting performances has an appeal far beyond the horror genre.

A great film with slight missteps,"This is a film that has entered the pop culture consciousness on behalf of the supporting character Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins') chilling performance. And if there is really anything that makes this film noteworthy it is his legendary performance.Beyond his performance, there are other reasons to like what this film does. It's very well paced and the dialogue is well done. The characters are mostly logical and smart. The classic thriller trope of ""finding"" new evidence is done tastefully and the investigation that takes place in the film seems mostly believable. The characters are well written with nice depth for the lack of time spent on character development. And finally, the film wraps pretty well into a very nice package. Jodie Foster also does a solid job in the lead role.Unfortunately I must point out some small...missteps that happen throughout the film. This isn't a spoiler: Starling is a member of the FBI academy and not a fully fledged agent yet. I am led to believe that this relationship is more fleshed out in the novel, but as the film presents it, it's hard to say why she would be a prominent investigator on a high profile FBI investigation. Without spoiling the plot of the film, I will also say that she makes somewhat questionable decisions to the end of the film. Furthermore, her deductions, although fine on the surface, seem problematic in that they are quite elementary. It seems like whatever investigators were previously on the case should have checked out the things which Starling ends up investigating. Curious to say the least.All in all, it is a great film that is pulled down by some slight missteps that break the illusion of grandeur for me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
iconic villain,"Trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is recruited right out of Quantico by Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) of the Bureau's Behavioral Science Services. He's investigating serial killer Buffalo Bill who skins his female victims. He's interviewing imprisoned killers but Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) refuses to cooperate. Starling is sent to talk to Lecter.Director Jonathan Demme takes the serial killer genre onto another level. It is brilliantly intense and brutal. It's a solid entry but then there is Hopkins' Lecter. It is an iconic villain for all times. From the moment he first appears, he steals the movie. It's rare that somebody can produce a character that is so original and so memorable. He is so impressive that he actually overshadows the penis-tucked human-skinning lotion-basket transvestite serial killer. Foster is also pretty solid.

"""Never Forget What He Is...""","Reasons this is so good:It has some of the best characters ever created embedded in a storyline that is so famously crisp, and clever that to watch it even after 100 previous viewings is still an absolute delight.It is a film of sheer talent, Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins play each others nemesis yet hide this in a tight net of trust and curiosity over each others character. and I think the unbelievable potency of Hannibal 'the cannibal' Lecter is so strong that to actually merge him into reality is totally feasible.Jonathan Demme also pulls off such fantastic direction, that is shockingly vivid and imaginative, and the atmosphere created with eerie scores in the background and repulsive locations (such as Buffalo Bill's house) is brilliance to a high degree. If you only ever watch one film a year I suggest you watch this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the best horror films,"When hearing about how terrifying Hannibal Lecter is, one would likely be confused after they look up reviews which explain why he works so well. It's really hard to do what Anthony Hopkins did in this film. While most other actors' performances would be likely dismissed as bland and boring, Hopkins nailed his performance so well that he rightfully earned his place amongst the very best movie villains ever put to screen.A serial killer who goes by the name of ""Buffalo Bill"" kidnaps and kills women to skin them and make them into coats. An F.B.I. cadet named Clarice Starling has to confide in a cannibalistic serial killer locked up in prison to help her locate him before he kills someone who he recently captured, Catherine Martin.When the viewer is first introduced to Dr. Hannibal Lecter, Starling is walking down an ominous hallway. She walks past other criminals locked up. The first few she walk by behave as you would expect. One is smiling and saying ""Hi"" to her, and the last one is jumping up at the prison bars. When she gets to the end of the hall, Dr. Hannibal Lecter is standing up and facing her with a blank expression on his face. He is still and motionless. He says ""Good morning"" to her calmly. He seems harmless. As Starling continues to talk to him, the viewer has a minor sense of relief for what the film could've thrown at us, but Hopkins' voice gives the viewer a feeling of deception which makes that sense of relief vanish. This is the first time we're introduced to him, and Lecter is able to unnerve the viewer so much by conveying so little. The great scripting and great acting made him quite a memorable character.Seeing his calmer moments on screen are very memorable. However, it leaves you wondering what he's capable of. Eventually, about 2/3 of the way into the film, the viewer gets to see Lecter pop in one of the most horrifying and memorable horror movie scenes of all time. The scene is so unexpected, and the sheer creativity of it is out-and-out disgusting to even think about. Watching the film a second time, it's frightening to find out what could've happened to Clarice Starling if their calm meetings had played out differently. However, it becomes very apparent that he wouldn't harm her as he grows to value her company. He never threatens her, and he always acts helpful and nice to her. Also, after he finds out how they both share similar childhood wounds, the viewer loses suspicion that he'll do something bad to her. Also, it took me a little while to pinpoint how that was a very effective piece of dialogue which got me to actually identify with Hannibal Lecter.It's a great accomplishment that the film gets us to like Hannibal Lecter. The reason is because he helps Starling locate Buffalo Bill which would also save Catherin Martin from him in the process, and he proves to be very helpful to her throughout the film. Also, the audience senses that he won't hurt her. On top of that, Hopkins performance brings wit and style to the character. The character of Dr. Hannibal Lecter succeeds on so many different levels.There are several scenes from the film which work very well at terrifying the viewer. The scene when ""Buffalo Bill"" kidnaps Catherine Martin is a believable technique which seems like it would work in real life. It shows how after you get too close to ""Buffalo Bill"" for too long, you would reach a point of no return, and by the time you realize that something bad is going to happen, it would already be too late.One of the most memorable kill scenes from horror movies happens near the final 1/3 of the film. I won't spoil it, but it works very well. Earlier in the film, it hinted that something was up after he stole a character's pen. Once you realize what's going to happen, you're left waiting for Lecter to pop as you've waited to see for a long time. The scene is very gory, and the aftermath of it is even more sickening. When you think that the scene's finally over, the film pulls the rug out from under you, and it shows you a creative, yet highly appalling image which likely won't leave your head anytime soon.The scene at the end in Buffalo Bill's was an amazing idea for a climax. It is so suspenseful, and as soon as it starts, you have minimal hope that it will turn out good. Then, director Jonathan Demme adds in one final aspect into the movie to up the tension so high that it's one of the most suspenseful climax's ever for a film. He makes it seem clear that Starling won't go home unless she either gets a miracle or gets badly injured in the process. This scene is terrifying, because of the film's clever manipulation of the visuals and the fact that we've come to really like Starling, and we don't want anything to happen to her.In conclusion, this is definitely a masterpiece, and it's one of the best horror films of all time. Anthony Hopkins' performance was perfect, and this movie should be looked at and studied off of for years to come. Other horror movie directors should study off of Dr. Hannibal Lecter and many actors should definitely try to do what he did. After the viewer witnesses all of the pros that this movie has to offer, it leaves you a brilliant closing scene which lets you go off on a high note.

"It tries to build a crawling sense of dread and menace, but...","Jonathan Demme's ""The Silence Of the Lambs"" is a grisly spook show, and one without any sympathy for its victims (or for the audience, who get a good hammering on the head). Yes, the Oscar-winning performances by Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster have become legendary (and for good reason, they are both intensely focused and driven), but the picture leaves scummy feelings in its wake, as if Demme had suddenly turned carnival barker for the ultimate freak show. FBI trainee Foster, invited into the gruesome investigation of a serial killer, seems to climb the ranks awfully easily, being allowed to do potentially dangerous work on her own as well as going mano a mano with Hopkins' Dr. Hannibal Lecter, an imprisoned cannibal who may hold the key to the crimes. There's chilly art in Demme's presentation--it's a polished piece of work--but I soon tired of the Woman as Hero underlying theme, complete with a who's-in-the-dungeon finale that doesn't work at all, the sacrificing of real human drama for shock value and lots of outlandish violence (such as a mutilated security guard hanging from the top of a prison cell like an angel). The black-humored kicker is that all this perverseness is good for a raunchy thrill, and what better way to arouse a stultified audience than to give us two psychopaths--one who eats his victims, the other who carves up women. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

One of the All-Time Great Thrillers,"Silence of the Lambs, The (1991)**** (out of 4)Intense masterpiece about an FBI trainee (Jodie Foster) who is tracking down a perverted serial killer and must receive help from Dr. Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lector (Anthony Hopkins). THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is a rare example of a film picking up Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress and Best Screenplay. It's a very rare thing for any film to do that but once you see this film it's easy to see why it was such a hit back in the day and why it hasn't lost a bit of its impact in the years since. I've always felt that the film was about as close to flawless as any film could get and it's strongest aspect is the brilliant performances mixed in with some of the greatest characters ever written. The film really is a mechanical workshop for how to build up suspense and beat the viewer over the head each step of the way. I've heard many people say they love the film but felt that it was just too intense for its own good, which I think is almost fair to say. Director Jonathan Demme does a masterful job at building all of this tension up and I really love how they pretty much try to make each and every scene something very creepy. This film has rightfully become legendary over the years and many of the best scenes contain some of the greatest suspense. The early scene where we first see Lector looking out at us. A wonderful sequence where Foster must crawl into a garage not knowing what she's going to find. There's a creepy autopsy sequence. Then, there's the famous scene with Lector inside the ""new"" jail cell and of course the perfect ending. The movie certainly doesn't throw in cheap humor to try and break the tension and instead it just continues to assault the viewer. The violence, while graphic at times, never takes away from what you're viewing and the film is so classy that it never falls into some sort of cheap exploitation flick. The performances really bring the characters to life and the way Foster and Hopkins play against one another has rightfully put them as some of the most memorable of all time. The way the two play their little chess match while trying to gather information from the other perfectly adds to the creepy atmosphere and you really do feel as if you're watching something very special. Scott Glenn is also very effective as Foster's mentor. Ted Levine plays the serial killer and I've always felt that he's the one who most often gets overlooked. There's no question that this film belongs to Hopkins and Foster but Levine is just so terrific in his part of Buffalo Bill that I've always been somewhat shocked that he doesn't get more attention. The tense music score, masterful cinematography and wonderful dark look just adds to what really is the perfect thriller. Since the release of this movie there have been many sequels, rip-offs and countless other films inspired by this one but nothing has come close to the perfection which is this movie. THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is a rare example of a blockbuster actually delivering the goods and it's clearly not only one of the best films of the decade but also one of the greatest ever made.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"eternally scary, and one for the library, definitely","I found this film extremely scary and haunting, even though the actual violence wasn't overpowering by today's standards. In some ways, the suspense and the build-up to scenes is quite ""old school"" and proves that this approach still works. There are has been a lot of analysis why this film is so powerful. One talks about how Hannibal Lecter only appears for a very brief time in the movie, yet others talk about him and build him up, how some of the set pieces refer to our deep psychological fears...in the end, it works well, and I would highly recommend it. I have read critics who say that the killer Clarice is pursuing is too stereotypical, or simplistic. I would beg to differ: I find that that character too is quite scary, though doesn't have the three-dimensional nature of Hannibal Lecter. And what of Clarice? she is brave, and even though it was made in the 90s, I think this film is still one of the first I saw with a woman as lead detective. Full marks to the script, and the book of course, because Clarice is quite fallible, not perfect, and this makes the story more real and unsettling. We're fighting in her corner, as it were, but we're not sure if she will win, unlike other male-dominated movies. And one personal quirk: watch out for Tom Petty's song, ""American Girl"", I found the usage interesting, fun and ironic, and the song has stuck in my head post the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

That she saw a lamb get slaughtered on a farm as a young girl? So what??? 2) Did she REALLY surmise ANYTHING from the ""clues"" he gave. Seems she somewhat randomly stumbles onto his house. 3) Too many closeups; too many plot contrivances. Nearly every scene is a closeup shot. Adds intensity at first, but quickly becomes annoying. That Lechter could uncuff himself from behind with the tip of a pen and overtake the two Keystone cops, not very believable. Less believable that he was ever placed is some makeshift iron box in the middle of a library or gymnasium. 4) She chases him down into his night vision dungeon? C'mon!! OK I get it for the movie's sake...but way too unrealistic. And with all the FBI's resources and knowledge they're somewhere else storming the empty house of a false lead? C'mon.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
doesn't deserve its high reputation,"Despite the impressive credentials this so-called thriller is nothing more than quality exploitation with highbrow pretensions, none of which can patch the many plot holes and jarring improbabilities. The script presents an awkward adaptation of what must have been a much fuller (if equally unpleasant) novel, compressing the material with too many transparent narrative gaps and shortcuts, including some amazing FBI deductions worthy of Sherlock Holmes.The idea of using one psychopath to help catch another is intriguing, but having two serial killers dilutes the impact of the story, especially when it focuses more on cartoon cannibal Anthony Hopkins, already in custody until his illogical, unlikely escape. Nothing much is learned about the other killer-at-large (an apparent reject from a David Lynch freak-show), and the film ends as a typical damsel-in-distress drama with haunted house shock effects.The screenplay is overloaded with bogus psychological significance and padded with irrelevant flashbacks, and the film was shot entirely in blunt, video-format close-ups, with director Jonathan Demme apparently trying to get inside the mind of his characters by simply shoving the camera in their faces. The manhunt is also highlighted by a gratuitous excess of explicit gore, but that doesn't stop it from having a happy ending, for everyone involved, including cannibal/killer Hannibal Lecter.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Are you up for the challenge?,"Very well directed with a heavy and ominous tone that shadows the entire movie. The sound and editing all function in creating and maintaining the film's eerie atmosphere. Reviewing this film, how could one not mention Anthony Hopkins chilling and creepy performance as Dr. Hannibal Lecter. He portrays, without a doubt, one of the best psychotic characters in cinema history. He's so good that at one point, you may start to, dare I say, root for him? The chemistry between Hopkins and Jodie Foster's character is brilliant and the dialogue between them is masterfully crafted. Once you let Hannibal into your mind, you can never get him out.

Great film based on a super book,"I had read this book by Thomas Harris and thought it would make a great movie but was concerned when I heard that Jonathan Demme was making it. How wrong I was though and I was overwhelmingly surprised. It was the first film about a serial killer where it did not rely on strong elements of violence and gore but simply left it to the imagination. Obviously Hopkins and Foster get all the plaudits and rightly so but this is one of the only films that has so many superb minor characters such as Barney, Ardelia Mapp and Bill himself. I urge those who like this movie to watch the making of documentary as it is truly fascinating. A roller-coaster ride of emotions and tension which I enjoy every time I watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Lambs Can Never be Silenced,"If you want a movie to watch in the dark, look no further than The Silence of the Lambs. Jonathan Demme's tense thriller combines excellent actors and a wonderfully adapted screenplay to make, what seems to be one of the best, if not the best, thrillers of all time.The film follows three main stories, those being that of rookie FBI agent, Clarice Starling, the psychopath murderer Buffalo Bill and imprisoned psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter, imprisoned for murder and cannibalism. Clarice is sent to Dr. Lecter to attempt to gain information on Buffalo Bill, because he was a former patient of Hannibal, however all Hannibal is interested in is getting inside Clarice's head. As the film goes on Clarice becomes more deeply involved in the case, right up to the dramatic and excellent climax, as well as Hannibal becoming more deeply involved in Clarice's mind. Meanwhile Buffalo Bill continues his murderous spree, killing and skinning women.This movie is like no other. It combines tenses scenes with a cast like no other. Anthony Hopkins was born to be Hannibal, and why Michelle Pfeiffer was originally suggested for the role of Clarice over Jodie Foster is bizarre, but because Jodie Foster got the role, it doesn't really matter. When it comes to violence this film is very intense. There are some graphically violent scenes, however the worst violence in the film is the mental violence. Hannibal's ability to destroy someone mentally, is incredibly disturbing, and the films motives are pretty full on. However this contributes to the films overall feel of horror, which is why The Silence of the Lambs is one of the most mentally frightening films of all time.Stars: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the best filmed stories,"The acting is of a very high level. Foster put down a good role as Clarice Starling and the supporting cast was very good (think of Buffalo Bill, for example). The star of the show is Anthony Hopkins. The role he put down here is really nothing less than genius. The dude is perfectly cast and is both friendly and polite, and very creepy and smart about it. I think it's an incredibly and fascinating character. Hannibal is for me one of the best psychopaths I've ever seen in a movie.Overall I highly recommend this movie if you love thrillers and detectives because this is definitely one of the best in its category for me. And i think this movie is also in my top 10 films!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Silence of the Lambs, an emotional ride of disbelief and terror","The 1991 suspense thriller, Silence of the Lambs, finds Clarice Starling, actress Jodi Foster, as a student at the FBI academy in Virginia. She's been chosen by her instructor, actor Lawrence Bonney, due to her noticeable keen senses, to visit with Dr. Hannibal Lecter, actor Anthony Hopkins, an incarcerated murderer. The intention is that Starling can use Lecter's insight into the mind of a murderer to find Buffalo Bill, actor Ted Levine, a serial killer whose victims are young girls.The theme of this film is control or power. In the film Clarice Starling is controlled by her drive to succeed as an FBI agent. She also has not found the power to control her memories of her childhood and the screaming of the lambs, which through her dealings with Dr. Lector she realizes. Ironically Dr. Lector himself, through his ability to manipulate minds, is perfectly able to control any and all situations; even through his incarceration has the power to affect others. Buffalo Bill on the other hand believes himself to be a transsexual and had been turned down for sex change surgeries from all major hospitals in the area. Therefore, his only way to express his control was by abducting young girls and murdering them and using their skin to create a woman's body. Ironically enough there is a pattern here. The majority of the power and control struggles are between Clarice and the men throughout her life and the story line, and with Buffalo Bill and his sexuality, and the young girls that he kills.The lighting and the angles used in the basement scene where Agent Starling was in the home of Buffalo Bill attempting to arrest him also aided to the theme of control. Buffalo Bill had shut off the lighting to the basement, leaving Starling unable to see a thing. Consequently, Buffalo Bill had on night goggles and was able to see every move Starling made. A terrified Starling scrambled around the basement, although blinded, searching for Bill. Finally, the simple sound of the trigger of Bill's gun being pulled back was all it took for Starling to locate bill and shoot the deadly shots that ended his terror (Bloch 1960). The overall lighting of the scenes throughout the film also aided to the theme of control. Early on the scenes tend to be more dark and dismal, but it seemed as though as Clarice gained more control, by having increased confidence, more insight, more acknowledgment from Crawford, and more trust from Lector, and got closer to solving the crime, the lighting itself became brighter throughout.The plot of the movie is to find a missing girl in West Virginia and to end serial killer Buffalo Bill's rampage. Special agent Jack Crawford, actor Scott Glenn, chose Cadet Clarice Starling for the task of interviewing a psychotic murderer Dr. Hannibal Lector in hopes that he could aid in the arrest of Buffalo Bill. Throughout the film Starling runs into obstacles and snares that seem to stand in her way, however her drive in solving the crime is stronger than those things standing in her way. One such obstacle is Dr. Frederick Chilton, actor Anthony Heald. Dr. Chilton is, to me, a little squeaky, weasel type character. He is out for self gain only and is trying to use Lector and his knowledge for his own benefit. Ultimately, Dr. Chilton met his doom in the end of the film by none other than Dr. Lector himself. After a botched attempt, at the direction of Jack Crawford, to find the most recent missing girl, Crawford and Starling were not permitted to speak to Lecter further. However that did not stop her from attempting to find and speak to him in attempt to find the killer. Although the male FBI agents had their leads, Starling had her own, and she was the one that ultimately solved the case.I can compare the theme of control and power of this film to that of Alfred Hitchcock's film Psycho. This film also has heavy displays of gender and power. The circumstances that stand out to me most are that of mental illness displayed in both films, the way that Norman Bates and Buffalo Bill have similar conflicts and are somewhat trapped in their roles and act out in a sinister way. There is one particular scene that I recall that immediately brought to mind the comparison of the two films. The scene where they were reviewing pictures of some of Buffalo Bill's victims showed a young girl lying face down, naked. Her eyes were wide open (Bloch 1960), and as they showed a close up of that picture I instantly saw the shower scene where Janet Lee lay on the bathroom floor, eyes wide open, and the shower water running (Bloch, 1960).Overall, I rate this movie very high. The suspense thriller allows the viewer to enter into the minds of Agent Starling, Hannibal Lecter and Buffalo Bill. It exhibits the affects of control and power, be it strong and weak, psychologically stable or unstable, educated or uneducated, male or female. Silence of the Lambs, takes us on an emotional ride of disbelief and terror as we see the story unfold.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"A good piece of cinema, but seemingly overrated beyond oblivion.","I find ""Silence of the Lambs"" to be one of those movies that is hailed by one and all, and yet is underwhelming once watched - definitely good, but still underwhelming. You wonder what the hullabaloo was all about.The settings were cartoonishly murky and dungeon-like, to the point that Lecter's asylum (and at points even Clarice's FBI training centre) looked like Hell itself. I also personally disliked the ""screaming lambs"" scene; it felt unnecessary and dragged, and Jodie Foster's emotional reactions to Hannibal's questions felt absolutely out of place. As if he miraculously healed her of her long nightmare-sufferings in an Osho-esque way.
Overall, the camera work, sound and direction are all great. I especially loved those first-person shots with Hopkins and Clarice. Very claustrophobia-inducing.Coming to the acting, Anthony Hopkins, though mightily entertaining - very often chuckle-inducing with his sly sarcasm - came across as far from real. His performance was in no way what a true psychopath (especially one so well educated) would be like. I honestly did not find the man scary, though I did find his screen-presence charismatic and imposing.
Jodie Foster was excellent , her vulnerability, her subtle pretence in font of Hannibal, everything.
Ted Levine was marvellous - that strange voice, his quirky dialogue and body language - it all added up perfectly. A great example would be the scene where he gives a slight chuckle, and then runs behind a corner, when confronted at his house. Hard to believe this was the same man who played Pacino's subordinate cop in ""Heat"".
Scott Glenn underplays his role so well, that he seems disarmingly real - cool and calm. It's no surprise that Clarice wanted to work for this guy.Conclusion: SOTL is by all means a very a good film, but to be called one of the greatest movies of all time? I don't think so.
It's predecessor ""Manhunter"" (1986) is by all means the superior Hannibal film, and in my humble opinion, much, much more significant a film (and by significant, I mean more worthy of being preserved in archives for times ahead, than ""Silence of the Lambs"") . Sadly, ""Manhunter"", although a cult classic now, has always been criminally under-appreciated and misunderstood (strong emphasis on ""misunderstood"") and has since remained under the shadow of this one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Silence of the Lambs review,Before I saw this movie Star Wars was my favorite film. I don't know if my tastes suddenly matured or what but when I walked out of the theater after seeing this movie for the first time I knew that Luke Skywalker and the gang had been trumped.Anthony Hopkins was superb as Hannibal Lecter. I have never seen anyone in all the years I have been watching movies seen an actor portray intelligent insanity any better. I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. Many times when I go to movies I sometimes think of other things that are related to the movie or not. In this film that did not happen and it was due mostly to the performance of Hopkins. I was thrilled that the film won the Academy Award for that year. I thought the rest of the cast was great to. Jodie Foster is good in anything that she chooses to take on and the casting was perfect for Buffalo Bill. Ted Levine really fit that freaky hick part so well.I thought the pacing of the movie was great to along with the cinematography which added to the suspense a great deal. Awesome direction and execution throughout the whole movie. I would consider this movie to be a must see for everyone interested in the thriller or psychological genres.,9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

'I'm having an old friend for dinner.',"I ate 'The Silence of the Lambs' up the first time I saw it and I've gone back for more who knows how many times. I can clean my plate and watch the whole thing, or just snack on certain scenes and be satiated. It is fine dining.I admit it's a little bizarre, but if I'm in low spirits I sometimes put *this* movie on to cheer myself up, especially if I'm depressed because I've watched some garbage modern movie. The sheer perfection of it never fails to raise me up a little, and the fact that it was made in 1991 gives me hope that the current crop of Hollywood actors and directors isn't unremittingly bad.The scenes between Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster are masterful, they're like the cadenzas to a violin concerto. I've watched those scenes by themselves about twice as often as I've seen the full movie. To see them feeding off each others performances is beautiful, a feast in itself, it doesn't even require fava beans or a nice chianti.But it isn't just Hopkins and Foster. There really isn't a poor performance in the entire film, maybe it's because I'm biased and I've seen it two dozen times but it seems like even the actors in the bit parts are far above average. The bug guys, Miggs, the deputies at the funeral home in Elk River, the chauffeur who ""detests physical labor.""Jonathan Demme's directing is so brilliantly subtle that it's easy to overlook given the gripping story and the incredible acting, but the last time I watched the entire movie I did indeed, ""feel eyes moving over Clarice's body."" I'd read about this before, and undoubtedly processed it subconsciously, but I'd never seen it so starkly. The fact is that throughout the movie men are staring at Jodie Foster, judging her, ordering her around, lusting after her, and finally trying to kill her. This produces an undercurrent of suspense even in scenes that don't necessarily have any other suspenseful elements.Finally, that they managed to do all this and still keep it so realistically lurid is, to me, nothing short of amazing. The pictures of the flayed girls, the bloody fingernail stuck in the wall of the pit, whatever that thing is in the bathtub, it's all so marvelously grotesque you get the feeling that certain too-polite elements of society would love to shun it, but the film is so good that it demands to be watched.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Flawless; An Absolutely Spectacular Treasure,"Immeasurably superior to its disappointing sequel ""Hannibal,"" ""Silence of the Lambs"" must surely rank as one of the absolute greatest thrillers of all time.Given the nature of the movie, there is surprisingly little graphic violence contained in it. The story focuses instead on the complex psychological relationship between FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) and the imprisoned cannibalistic serial killer and ex-psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins.) Both Foster and Hopkins are brilliant. Foster has the larger role, and carries it off well, but Hopkins steals the movie with a frighteningly realistic portrayal of a frightening serial killer. Lecter, approached by the FBI because they believe he might be of assistance in helping identify a current serial killer known as ""Buffalo Bill,"" sees in the FBI's interest an opportunity to escape imprisonment, and plays a series of mind games with Starling (and anyone else who wants to speak to him about the case.)Director Jonathon Demme effectively weaves two stories (the hunt for the serial killer, and the Starling-Lecter relationship) together into a taut thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat. And, in the end, has there ever been a better, funnier and more thoroughly chilling line in any movie than Lecter's closing comment to Clarice: ""I have to go now. I'm having an old friend for dinner.""I can't identify a single weakness in this movie. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
masterpiece,"The film ""The Silence of the Lambs"" has changed a lot, above all, our standards. The audience drastically changed their view of the concept of a good thriller. Balanced center of gravity was found on the graphical violence but also the intellectual and psychological rally, where there was essentially what we are already showing what is sketchy, with the potential to happen. With each repeated viewing, we recognize the key elements behind the facade fascinating serial killer in order to discover a whole range of people of different walks of life, crossed in a single unattractive existence. Almost twenty-two years since first screening, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" remains the definition of thriller of our time. Too bad Jonathan Demme did not direct not nearly as good as this that today is undoubtedly a classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The lambs are unlikely to ever stop screaming.,"Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), a young rookie FBI agent, is enlisted to help in the hunt for a serial killer known as Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine). To aid the investigation she is requested to interview an already incarcerated psychopath, the infamous Dr Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). Cunning and very intelligent, Lecter takes a shine to Starling but will only assist her if she is prepared to let him into her personal make up. As Buffalo Bill kidnaps the daughter of an American senator the clock starts to tick downThe Silence of the Lambs is directed by Jonathan Demme and stars Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, Scott Glenn, and Ted Levine. It is based on the novel of the same name by Thomas Harris. It won the top five Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Actor, Best Director and Best Screenplay. With a production budget of $19 million the film went on to record a staggering Worldwide profit of almost $254 million. Those awards and those figures don't lie, The Silence Of The Lambs is one of the rare occasions where everything came together perfectly.The source novel is in truth brilliant anyway, but how many times have we seen film makers make a hash of good material by either cutting corners, or by trying to be too Hollywood in the telling? Too many is the answer. Jonathan Demme and his team know that not much needs tampering here, their task was to understand Thomas Harris' complex characters and give them narrative strength, which they got courtesy of Ted Tally's brilliant writing. The portrayals of said characters have gone down in history to an extent they barely need me to have an opinion. From the first meeting of Starling and Lecter down in the bowels of the asylum, to the cheeky and unnerving closure, Foster & Hopkins engage and chill respectively, one of the weirdest, yet most tender relationships to have hit the silver screen. Scott Glenn is professional personified as Jack Crawford, while in the wake of Hopkins' classy monster show it gets forgotten just how brilliantly twisted Ted Levine makes Buffalo Bill. Two quality monsters for the price of one movie here, a bargain if ever there was one.For all the plaudits for cast, direction and writing et al, ""Lambs"" climbed to the top echelons of 90s cinema because it also exists as an excellent thriller, even a pant filling horror at times. While it also works very well as a criminal procedure movie. We know who the killer is quite early on in proceedings, but with Lecter tossing out conundrums and the FBI utilising all their tricksy scientific methods, it makes for a fascinating watch. And lest we forget that Demme shows himself to not only be a purveyor of adroit pacing, but quite a dab hand at thrilling set-pieces too-one that would be a spoiler should I mention it, and the other coming during a wonderful double handed twister as the net hopefully closes in on Billy Boy.

The Darker Side of Human Nature Explored Through a Very High-Quality Yet Disturbing Film,"The Silence of the Lambs, based on the Thomas Harris book of the same name, is one of the most disturbing films based on fictional material to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best Director. When you consider that films like ""My Fair Lady"", ""the Sound of Music"", ""Gandhi"", ""the Hurt Locker"", ""Schindler's List"", ""Driving Miss Daisy"", ""Rain Man"", and ""Forrest Gump"" have also earned the Best Picture prize, Lambs stands alone; similarly disturbing films are predominantly historical dramas. The only other Best Picture winners equaling the horror of ""Lambs"" are ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", ""Platoon"", and ""Unforgiven"". But none of these movies ever dealt with not one but two serial-killer sociopaths in a suburban-rural setting.An outstanding horror-suspense film, ""Lambs"" is not for the feint of heart. ""Lambs"" centers around three characters dealing with intense psychological dysfunction. Each character in turn not only reacts to their dysfunction in their own style but is in very different circumstances. Two of the three engage in horrific behavior of extreme violence, succumbing to the darkest side of human behavior as a result of their mental illness and dysfunctional pathology. At the story's beginning, one of them is in an institution for the criminally insane, having had a history of violent and sadistic behavior. The second is on the loose, dispatching young women for reasons yet unknown. The third character deals with her psychological issues by joining the FBI, and her reason d'etre becomes a mission to stop such behavior and rescue potential victims at the hands of psychological killers.If a ""story"" is about the growth and change of a character, then Lambs' narrative is really about Clarice Starling, an FBI trainee who is majoring in the Behavioral Science division which does psychological profiling of criminals, particularly serial killers. Her first real task, or test in a sense, is to psychologically profile the serial killer Hannibal Lecter, nicknamed ""the Cannibal"", played with such a believable yet sadistic sensibility by Anthony Hopkins that make Dracula and Frankenstein's monster seem more like Saturday morning cartoon villains by comparison. Lecter is possibly one of the most fascinating and simultaneously repulsive characters in fiction and film. He is a fusion of an Ivy League liberal arts professor who easily quotes ancient philosophers and the Monster of Venice, an Italian serial killer who dispatched victims, usually women, without a shred of empathy. But Lecter also has a fondness for high culture, displayed by his drawing of the Duomo in Milan. Italy.We learn Lecter had been a university professor of psychology who made it a habit of eating human victims. At story's beginning, he resides at a prison of mentally disturbed criminals where Starling first meets him in person. Also, we learn the FBI is hot on the trail of a strange woman-killer, the second character nicknamed Buffalo Bill by the press. Starling and Lecter form a strange yet compelling bond, not quite true friendship but something more meaningful than mere acquaintance. Part of the story is the evolution of Starling's and Lecter's relationship. A very subtle undertone of sexual flirting is hinted at in some scenes and yet we know that these two worlds could never permanently mesh.Eventually, Starling begins to solicit the help of Lecter to arrest the perpetrator of the horrid acts . We believe it's an accidental interaction at first, but then we learn that the solicitation is the brainchild of the head of the FBI's criminal behavioral division, Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn). Other agents had tried and failed to convince Lecter to assist, so he tries another tact: send a green trainee to Lector without telling her Crawford's real intentions. Buffalo Bill has dispatched five women, but no one at the agency can figure out his motive. With Lecter's help, Starling begins to unravel who Buffalo Bill is from a psychological standpoint as a means of finding out his identity and where he lives. Part of the narrative involves the revealing of both Starling and her target Buffalo Bill, although the most interesting and colorful character, Hannibal Lecter, remains completely enigmatic. The story then pushes into a new direction when a young woman from a prominent family is kidnapped and it is believed she has been abducted by Buffalo Bill. Can Starling extract enough information from Lecter to save the young woman before Buffalo Bill dispatches another innocent victim?One of the first elements that strikes you about Lambs is its foreboding atmosphere with some scenes having a quasi-medieval flavor. When Starling first visits the corridor inside the mental prison which houses Lecter, you feel like you're walking into a medieval dungeon. The stone brick is dirty and damp, and the inmates seem like something right out of Dante's Inferno (Hell). The same is true for Buffalo Bill's hideout, a maze of dark corridors filled with strange objects, like mannequins and costumes. The place where he imprisons his victims rings of something out of the Spanish Inquisition. Themes of raw sexuality permeate the entire story, although there is no love affair between any of the characters. Simultaneously, there are also overtones of objectifying human beings. Dr Chilton, the doctor in charge of Lecter at the hospital, boasts of having his sociopath patient, ""So rare to capture one alive. From a research point of view, Lecter is our most prized asset,"" as if Lecter is a rare object rather than a person. Also, the serial killers objectify their victims as a means of rationalizing their behavior.""The Silence of the Lambs"" is one of the best horror-suspense films of its type with absolutely first-rate acting by the leads and the supports. And one of the most disturbing. But if you're looking for escapist innocent fun, Lambs will have you running under the covers, or at least switching to ""My Fair Lady"". Lecter and Buffalo Bill are the stuff nightmares are made of.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

It is the only horror film to ever win Best Picture, and it made all sorts of money-- staying on top of the box office for like 5 weeks and already having made back its budget in the first. So the data coming in would say that I would probably write a review on how good Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster were, and how this is such a landmark horror film that would rival The Shining as being the best ever. But I'm not going to. I believe this movie has been highly overrated, and if you allow me to explain, perhaps you'll end agreeing with me too.When you think about this movie, the first thing you think of is either fava beans or Hannibal the Cannibal. But the star is Jodie Foster... What's her character's name again? Clarence, Karen, Carly? You know what, doesn't really matter. We'll save Jodie Foster for later because Anthony Hopkins is really what this movie is known for. And there's a lot of good to indeed say. His looking right at the camera as his character is introduced, his improv mocking of Foster's accent, his unblinking eyes and famous lines. Oscar Winner? Sure. It's all there. My criticism will be discussed later when we talk about the director. What I will say, however, is that Ted Levine is vitally underappreciated as Buffalo Bill. First, I'm glad to see Teddy in a role that isn't a sheriff or cop. Buffalo Bill's luring of women and skinning his victims already made him a viable villain, but it's his dancing in front of the mirror that takes the crown and serves as the creepiest thing in the film.Okay, I can't hold back any longer. Gotta talk about how this movie suffers. Over the course of filming, I have no issue with the directing. It's not too special, but it's not bad; the camerawork is a different story. It's inconsistent, sloppy, and moves around too much. It tries creating a style that just doesn't work for the film. The exception is Dr. Lecter's scenes. Everything works there, but it seems like the film basically was built around what happened there. Which brings me to the actual story and the editing. We start with Jodie proving herself in the FBI and toughing it out as a female there. It's brief, and some exposition is quickly thrown in to establish her character because, after all, we have to hurry up and get to Hannibal. Which still doesn't seem totally logical. They go to one of the most dangerous and cunning psychiatrists to help catch the notorious Buffalo Bill, and they send an FBI agent who hasn't even graduated? That doesn't add up for me. Fast forward a scene or 2 and we get introduced to Buffalo Bill. It's a disturbing scene, but now we know who everyone is looking for. So the small amount of film dedicated to detective work really hardly serves any purpose because, after all, let's just get back to Hannibal. However smart the Hannibal scenes may be, they're also predictable. And the music really is more nonchalant than anything, and when you mix it all together, you get a film that really isn't all that scary. It's a cop story with a good, not great, female lead and an unremarkable story, so it all dwindles down to Hannibal. And he's truly a pretty great movie psycho, but surround him in a film that is surrounded around him, and the result is just eh.The climax has predictable moments, but it was leading up to the tense finish I was hoping for the entire film. And then the decisive moment happened and it was so lame. The redeeming part is how the movie ended because despite my criticism from before, I thoroughly enjoyed the ending. So there is that. But if you want an actually scary film with a cool, strong heroine, go watch Alien, Zero Dark Thirty, or just something else.

Silence of the Hams,"Having read both the Prequel (Manhunter) and Silence of the Lambs, I was looking forward to seeing how the transition to the screen went.A while back ""Manhunter"" was released, and although abridged and with a different (but better) ending, I loved it. Particularly Brian Cox as Hannibal Lecter, soft spoken, analytical and very, very calm. However, always an undercurrent of danger and a mere whisper of insanity.Now on to ""Silence of the Lambs"" - Hannibal Lecter has gone from being an all too believable real-life monster to a giggling Hollywood psycho - a veritable troll complete with his own dungeon (alas, no smoking torches) and a set of eyes wide enough to make Marty Feldman blink.Serial murderers such as this, particularly highly intelligent ones, do not prance about revelling in how evil they are, nor do they speak in such ridiculous snidley tones.They appear quite normal - the reason why they managed to get away with what they did for the length of time they did. Occasionally they speak in monotones and look at nothing in particular. Check out interviews of real-life serial killers - you won't find Anthony Hopkins's fairground pastiche there.The story itself rambled, the interplay between the two characters did'nt work - Hopkins possibly due to the material, Foster due to the lack of a believable protagonist. They have thankfully both done far better work than this both before and since.There were some (very few) well designed moments and images but the end was both predictable and dissapointing.Films are supposed to mirror real life, not the expected perceptions of the mainstream. Otherwise, what happens to creativity?Oh dear - we're back in Hollywood again.Dan",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A mostly effective thriller with two excellent acting performances,"Only the third film ever in Academy Award history to sweep the top five awards. Also, the first time a thriller wins a Best Picture Academy Award. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is most famous for Anthony Hopkin's memorable chilling performance as the clever, charming, cultured, well mannered serial killer Dr.Hannibal Lecter. Hannibal Lecter's character is a composite based on several real life serial killers, including Ted Bundy. Jody Foster gives a powerful, intelligent complementary acting performance as the FBI agent trainee recruited to help catch another serial killer, Buffalo Bill, with the help of Lecter.What's most impressive about the film is the pairing of Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster. They both bring intelligence, believability and a strong minded directness. They play exceptionally well off each other: Lecter is intelligent, but obviously crazy, while Starling is very sane, determined and intelligent enough to match wits and will against the evil, charming, well mannered and clever Lecter.Not having seen the film in several years, with a fresh perspective, it came across to me as an unusually creepy, strange psychological film. That's a compliment. We have a rare portrayal of a transvestite serial killer, Buffalo Bill. The film contains two scenes I've never seen before, ever, in any film. The first involves Clairice Starling at the beginning of the film, shortly after she first meets Hannibal Lecter in the insane asylum dungeon. The second scene is near the end of the film and involves a very bizarre disguise used by Hannibal Lecter.Hopkins performance in this film, is my all time movie villain favorite. As a thriller, it works well most of the time, narrative wise. There are a few factual errors. The film is best when both Hopkins and Foster are on screen together. Then it's quite a powerful and gripping psychological drama.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the Greatest Ever.,Dr hannibal lecter is a brilliant psychiatrist as well as a cannibalistic serial killer who eat his victims for the apparent rude behaviour of theirs.Lecter is deeply offended by rudeness and prefers to eat the rude so as to speak.No one at the first glance can say that lecter is a killer because his mannerisms are very calm and collective his thoughts are.Only once he attacks a nurse and bites off some flesh off her face they have to restrain him and put a mask on his face to stop further damage.This seemingly charming individual is incarcerated at a correctional facility and clarice seeks some help from him to find another serial killer.,8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Covet this film, and you will see it everyday...","""Silence of the Lambs"" will never be silenced.  It easily ranks among the best movies of the 90's.  Anthony Hopkins steals the show here, even though he is not the serial killer at large.  He manages to be menacing yet charming at the same time, which is often a quality of our most infamous serial killers.  Jonathan Demme did an excellent job directing this move, and rightfully received an Oscar reward for best director.  He kept everything going at just the right pace and allowed enough time for character study to flavor the film further.  ""Silence of the Lambs"" is loaded with memorable scenes; my favorite one is where Jodie Foster has to feel her way around the dark while the killer (wearing night-vision goggles) just toys with her for a while.  Since ""we covet what we see everyday,"" try not to give in to the temptation of seeing ""Silence of the Lambs"" everyday as there is no telling what might happen then...",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Brilliant thriller,"Finally a deserved Oscar winner from the early 1990s! Among so many best picture mistakes, the Academy got it right in 1992, as Jonathan Demme's borderline-horror masterpiece still manages to terrify and unsettle more than 30 years after being awarded Best Picture.The performances of Hopkins and Foster have become legend, particularly Hopkins as Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lector, who charms and manipulates his way through the film so brilliantly we actually end up rooting for him.Foster's Clarice Starling is an FBI cadet trying to find serial killer Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine, way too convincing as this sick maniac) who is skinning his victims. Only Lecter can help Clarice solve the case, but can she get him to cooperate before Bill kills again? Brilliant thriller 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of The Top Ten Overrated Movies Of All Time,"Silence Of The Lambs is an average movie that has been hyped to classic status. The superb performance by Anthony Hopkins is the only saving grace of this film.  Jodie Foster is terrible as usual, she has to be one of the worst actress of our time.  The biggest problem with the film is the absurd premise that a FBI student (She is not an agent) would be left alone to handle an investigation of this magnitude. Sorry but that just isn't going to happen.  This movie is worth one viewing for Hopkins performance and that's it.  It shouldn't even rate in the top 500 movies of all time.  5.4 on a scale of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

I really feel that more could have been done with this movie than what they did.The main reason people like this film is because its a ""psychological"" thriller, implying that if you dont like this film you are considered dumb.(which is not the case).This is a very overrated film...very overrated but its worth seeing..so you can say ""I have seen silence of the lambs.""

Brilliant! Amazing! The best thriller of the 90's!,"First of all I have to say that ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is the film which inspired all the serial-killer films of the 90's (good ones like ""Se7en"" and silly ones like ""Kiss the Girls""). But ""The Silence of the Lambs"" has many things the other thrillers don't have.In this film we can see two of the best performances ever. Anthony Hopkins is just perfect as Hannibal Lecter, and so is Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling. The dialogues between these two characters are brilliant, and so is the whole screenplay.The film has a great story which explores deeply the main characters. It is not just a serial-killer story, but above all a deep dramatic thriller.""The Silence of the Lambs"" impressed me so much that I've watched it many times.So if you hadn't watched it, take your time and see it.Surely one of the best films ever made.Rating: 10/10I heard that Ridley Scott is about to direct the sequel of ""The Silence of the Lambs"", with Sarah Michelle Gellar as Clarice Starling. Well... I truly love Sarah and she's one of the greatest actresses of her generation. But we see Clarice Starling as Jodie Foster and, you know, many people will compare Sarah's acting with Jodie's.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A work of cinematographic art!,"""The Silence of the Lambs"" is the smartest horror-thriller ever filmed, with a spectacular screenplay based on the novel of the same name written by Thomas Harris, which in turn was based on the American serial killer Edward Theodore ""Ed"" Gein (for the character Jame ""Buffalo Bill"" Gumb) and in the Mexican murderer Alfredo Ballí Treviño (for the character Hannibal Lecter). The script masterfully adapted by Ted Tally plays with suspense, mystery and horror in a way never before matched, touching on subjects of psychology and criminology. The performances of Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins and Ted Levine are superb, leaving their characters as icons of cinema and pop culture around the world. Tak Fujimoto's cinematography is a visual enchantment, the music composed by Howard Shore is an aural delight, and Jonathan Demme's cinematographic direction is a marvel that has no equal. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is the only horror film in history to win an Oscar in the category of Best Film of the Year, being since 1991 a film that became an instant classic. 30 years later, Hannibal Lecter continues to be an icon of horror that makes an impression on audiences. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" the masterpiece of the '90s, unsurpassed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Effective Psychological Horror, Elevated by an Excellent Script and One Supreme Performance","Though he's merely an important supporting player in the plot's bigger picture, Anthony Hopkins completely dominates The Silence of the Lambs as the complex, cultured mass-murderer with a taste for human flesh, the disgraced Doctor Hannibal Lecter. It's a genuinely transcendent performance, the likes of which we're lucky to catch once or twice per decade. Jodie Foster more than pulls her weight in the leading role, a tenacious FBI cadet who endures misogyny and harassment at every stop, but it's Lecter who brings the real sizzle, and their mutually perplexing psych ward interactions transform a rather pedestrian production into something downright hypnotic.Himself a trained psychiatrist, Hannibal has made no effort to disguise his contempt when confronted by the bureau's more highly-accredited shrinks. He's the smartest, most refined man in the room and they all know it, so why pretend otherwise? Lecter clearly stopped following such social niceties years ago. By contrast, he sees something intriguing in the young, ambitious Clarice Starling. Maybe it's her open honesty, her bald naïveté or her willingness to brazenly march straight into the lion's mouth. He senses a not-so-distant trauma in her past and gamely chases it, indulging his professional instincts and savoring the hell it puts her through. For her part, Starling is perfectly willing to play that charade, even if it means plumbing a number of deeply uncomfortable personal depths, to aid the state's pursuit of a different psychopath. Though it's faltering and unsettling, the quid pro quo works for both of them. And for us.I alluded to this earlier, but the nuts and bolts of The Silence of the Lambs really aren't very good. The editing is hammy, the score's worthy of a TV movie and the production values are obviously low. Neither Hopkins nor Foster were the studio's first (or second, or third) choices, but fate, gladly, intervened. With those actors, in those roles, reading from this screenplay, it's bonafide movie magic. Damn near perfection. I'd gladly watch Hannibal and Clarice match wits and decipher puzzles in that clammy prison basement for hours upon hours, and suspect I may do exactly that over the course of the next few decades.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Fantastic!,"This is one fantastic movie. Anthony Hopkins plays the brilliant, all knowing, Dr. Hannibal Lecter who 'helps' in his one unique style(which becomes clearer each time you see the movie), rookie FBI agent Clarice Starling track down 'Buffalo Bill', serial killer. Lecter, the genius that he is, perceives Starlings inner demons and want to know more about her in exchange for information about the serial killer. His line: ""Quid pro quo, Clarice. Quid pro quo. You tell me things, I tell you things"" is my (and my wife's) favorite. Lecter engineers events and makes a daring escape which is gripping to watch. Hopkins portrayal of Lecter has been voted by AFI as the the number 1 villain of all time and deserves it all time.

Even the character of Buffalo Bill is very much creepy but Lekter wins for me. Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal has delivered a stunning performance. Jodie Foster has also done a good job. The psycho-thriller theme is well established throughout the movie. Its creepy in a sense. The movie is nearly perfect in every aspect.

Some new aspects,"When I first saw this film, I was about 14, lying in my bed, watching it in German on TV late at night, with the lights on, and almost falling asleep (probably actually dozing for a couple of minutes now and then). When I was waking up once, noticing Hannibal Lecter on my television screen, looking at me with his alive, clear eyes and speaking to me about screaming lambs, that was surely one of the most exciting moments in my movie-interested life. So it is definitely a good idea to see this at night, with one's concentration wandering away.Now I saw it again (at daylight!), and many other things struck me. The character of Catherine Martin is actually really cool. The snobbish daughter of a famous politician reacts to the terrible things that are done to her in an unusually offensive way - it looks as if she was never giving up.And then did you notice how utterly serious this film is? There is not a single funny scene in it. And this is really great!

Best Novel to Movie  Adaption,"A tight-wound thriller, and sequel to Thomas Harris' 1981 novel Red Dragon (though the movie Red Dragon came almost a decade later on this movie's shoulders), this is quite simply one of the best novel to movie adaptations till date.

Jodie Foster as an FBI trainee plays her role to perfection in finding a serial killer with Hannibal's help. 'Buffalo Bill' played by Ted Levine has also done great job in his portrayal as a psychopath killer whom the FBI is searching for.The plot is simple yet the viewer simply can not escape the tension throughout the movie. There are enough twists and turns to keep the viewer glued to the movie. You wait for Hannibal to come on screen in the same way you wait for dinosaurs to come in the Jurassic Park.

Apprentice Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) works hard to advance her career, as she tries to hide or leave behind her West Virginia roots, which, if some knew, they would automatically classify as backward or trash. White. Upon graduation, she aspires to work in the agency's Behavioral Sciences Unit under the leadership of Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn). While still an apprentice, Crawford asks him to question Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Sir Anthony Hopkins), a psychiatrist imprisoned, until now, for eight years in maximum security isolation for being a serial killer who cannibalized his victims. Clarice is able to realize that the task is to collect Lecter's brains to help them solve another serial murder case, that of someone coined by the media as ""Buffalo Bill"" (Ted Levine), who has so far killed five victims, all located in the eastern US, all young women, slightly overweight (especially around the hips), all who drowned in natural bodies of water, and all who were stripped of large stripes of fur. She also imagines that Crawford chose her, as a woman, in order to trigger some emotional response from Lecter. After speaking with Lecter for the first time, she realizes that everything with him will be a psychological game, and often she will have to read between the very cryptic lines that he provides. She has to decide how long the game will continue, since her request in exchange for talking to him is to expose herself emotionally to him. The case takes a more serious turn when a sixth victim is discovered, from whom they can retrieve a key piece of evidence, if Lecter is being frank about its meaning. A potential seventh victim is high-profile Catherine Martin (Brooke Smith), the daughter of Sen.

One of the great movies compared to the book execllent but....,One of the great movies compared to the book execllent but it needed more info on lector and more backround towards him instead of bufallo bill... if they chose to keep lectar as a minor charecter [ they didnt] then it would be ok not to give to much descriptive details.. it still was a very good movie besides some other atachtments to it .. Another good thing to do was to mainly do some backround on the trial of lectar which was the one that got him in the prison in the first place.. the movie on the other hand was a very good one considering it invovled a cereal killer unlike scream [ the worst thing that i would call a horror film] it had a unique touch to it that made it so popular,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Inferior to ""Se7en"" but a good movie - just overrated!","Hannibal. The very name sparks fear, discomfort, and ultimately recognition. He is one of the most popular screen characters of all time, the incarnation of evil, and yet strangely likable despite his distasteful savoring of human flesh. ""I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice bottle of chianti,"" he tells FBI Agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) after she meets him in a prison, metal bars their only means of separation.Their first conversation and face-to-face interaction is a vital element of the film's narrative; the bars represent Starling's own self-defense; they have wide-open spaces that are easily penetrable. And Hannibal Lecter, a psychologist and cannibal, knows exactly how to reach past her own mental cell bars and crack into her brain, and he does so in the classic scene where she recalls memories from her childhood, of the lamb she tried to save...Agent Starling is on the case of a bizarre serial killer whose victims tend to be young women. Although they are unaware of his motives, it turns out the infamous ""Buffalo Bill"" is using the skin of these unfortunate victims for his own sick pleasure. He's not the sort of person you'd feel comfortable being stuck next to in an otherwise empty elevator.Clarice is smart, a feminine icon of the movies. Her brains are what propel her own investigation into the case while her desire to unearth the truth and succeed past the results of her male counterparts stems from a sort of egotistical dominance. Not many people comment upon Sterling's own sexuality, her almost overly excessive efforts at saving the victims (who happen to be females). Buffalo Bill seems to represent her own image of men: cruel creatures who inflict pain and suffering upon helpless women. Her sole friend, the only man she can rely on for help and inside tidbits, is an outcast upon society -- a metaphor for the repressed homosexuals who are abandoned by their own societies, shunned by those who feel they are not ""normal."" Harris's underlying implications of homosexuality and female dominance in the novel are admittedly stronger than in the film, although the presence of the suggestions is clearly evident under close examination.Or, it could just be about serial killers and FBI agents. You decide.Sure, the movie is famous, but we must ask ourselves whether or not the film's reputation has given it a better face over the year than it has deserved. It is well directed, but never does the film fascinate us as the bold and daring ""Se7en"" did. ""Silence of the Lambs"" is a fine film, but pales in comparison to some of its imitators and fellow genre occupants.The acting and writing is not at fault. Hopkins and Foster are superb. Hopkins received the most critical acclaim, although in 2001 we all realized that Foster was a key to the series as well, when she was unsuccessfully replaced with Julianne Moore in the sequel, ""Hannibal,"" directed by Ridley Scott, which was a total failure and disappointment for the fans of the original and source material, the novels by Thomas Harris, who has reportedly never seen ""Silence of the Lambs"" for fear that it would influence his writing.""Lambs,"" more than any other film in the series, is terribly manipulative, complete with tacky flashbacks that are out of place and all too convenient. That's where the film ultimately fails. The direction by Jonathan Demme is, truth be told, rather poor and borderline mediocre; Demme does not use cinematography to his advantage, does not use darker tones to evoke feelings from the prints as Fincher did with ""Se7en."" It's a great movie with convincing performances and a realistic script packaged in the form of a typical Hollywood thriller -- it might have a good reputation, it might be a good movie, but compared to other classics of the genre, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" just doesn't hold up as much as I had hoped it would after all these years. It's revolutionary, but isn't the masterpiece it used to be.On the plus side there's always that terrific ending to look forward to.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The psychopathology is all wrong.,"I was not impressed with this film, and it's phoney psychiatry. I have some professional experience in working with the criminally insane, in the US and UK. While there are a few staff in the profession who would allow themselves to be manipulated in the way that Clarice Starling does, I cannot conceive any real life situation where so many of her colleagues would allow this situation, known as ""team splitting"", to continue. It is routine behaviour for psychopaths to attempt to team split, as Lekter does, but it is such a standard ploy that it would be recognised in any institution other than the toyland one in the film and quickly dealt with, and I resent the attitude of the storyline in glorifying this behaviour. Trust me people, if you are in this situation, don't allow patients to split you away from your colleagues, you may think they are interested in you but they will get bored with playing with you in the end. When patients are given this power, which they cannot handle, it makes them more scared, and less likely to learn. In his attempt to make Frederick Chilton, the character that should be the good guy, in to the bad guy, either the actor or the director has gone way over the top, to the point where where pathos becomes bathos, and as for Anthony Hopkins, he lost all credibility for me when he announced in a British tabloid that he was sorry for seeming to condone violence in the role he was playing, and then within a few months proceeded to repeat the role in the sequel, ""Hannibal"". That's why I never bothered to see the film until just recently.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"""You Don't Want Hannibal Lecter Inside Your Head""","Demme and his long-time collaborator, Tak Fujimoto, have a crack at turning a weird novel into a movie.  I'm afraid to say that it doesn't work.There are moments when the film seems about to go somewhere interesting, but each time the idea fizzles out.  Clarice's flashback memories are evoked by Lecter's nasty mindgames, but in the end her feelings for her lost father are opened up too pedantically and the chance to do something truly disturbing is lost.  An exquisite dilemma is set up - should Agent Starling flout her orders and training, and subject herself to appalling risks, in order to save the endangered Catherine?  But Lecter decides to pursue other objectives, and the potential is squandered.Intelligence is a fine thing in a film, and it is very satisfying for the viewer to see the clues unravelled in a thriller.  However, cleverness for its own sake, unanchored in the bedrock of character, is a pernicious thing.  Lecter's anagrams ('Hester Mofet') don't come off, partly because they are too remote from the chase itself, and partly because they have to be explained to the audience.  ""We covet what we see every day ..."" - this is hopelessly poor as a clue, and when the agents solve it, I for one am reminded of the TV ""Batman"" episode when the Penguin commits robberies all over Gotham which, when marked on the map, sketch out the shape of his distinctive hat.  It's as far-fetched as that.Doctor Chilton is awful.  He is a cartoon character, outlandishly pompous and unsympathetic.  The prisoner's escape ploy makes me cringe, it is so preposterous - wouldn't the paramedics actually try to examine the supposed facial wounds?  And why are they pumping him full of Ringer's solution without ascertaining that he's losing haemostatic pressure?Admittedly, Clarice's time in Bill's house is psychologically gripping, but this has nothing to do with the film's alleged cleverness.  It is the oldest device of all, to get us to 'know' the girl, so that we make some emotional investment in her, then stick her in an old dark house with the creepy bad guy.  Nothing about that final sequence stands up to even the lightest analysis.  Why doesn't the FBI agent simply call for back-up, and stay put?  Once she locates the victim, isn't her duty to stay with her to protect her?  Once Bill eludes the agent, why doesn't he just escape?  He can't want to kill the agent as part of his compulsion.  She doesn't come close to fitting the victim profile that the film has so laboriously developed for us.  He must know that if he remains at the scene, other agents will arrive soon.Lecter is interesting enough initially, but one has to question the way the film makes a hero of him.  Are psychotic killers imprisoned in cages in large rooms like this?  Are they handcuffed to the bars at mealtime?  And supervised by a team of two no-brainers?  Can they dupe SWAT teams and medical staff with ease, and escape, blood-soaked, from busy cities?  Do we really prefer Lecter to Chilton?  And if we do, should we?  I don't want Hannibal inside my head, not because he is terrifying (which he isn't), but because he is a waste of my time.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Very Terrifying,"This movie had scared the bejebus out of my sister. But I'm mad that I haven't seen this movie a lot sooner than last year when I was 17. I wish I seen this movie when I was like 10, I just loved horror. But then again, this movie isn't a horror movie, it's more of a psychological thriller. This is hands down the most terrifying thriller of all time, I wouldn't recommend than young teenage girls (if you're brave enough) see this movie because it might scare you. But nevertheless, this is a great movie.Swept all five major academy awards for best actor in a lead role, best actress in a lead role, best picture, best screenplay, and best directing.

Good movie to be scared of!,"""The Silence of the Lambs"" is the first movie that won an Academy Award for Best Picture to be widely considered as a horror film and the only the second such film to be nominated in the category, with the second film being ""The Exorcist"", released in 1973.In the film, a young US FBI trainer named Clarice Starling, seeks the advice of the imprisoned Dr. Hannibal Lector to apprehend another serial killer, known only as Buffalo Bill, a.k.a. Jame Gumb, who murders young girls and takes their skin and uses it for something.The acting is amazing and the cast is all top-notch: Oscar-winner Jodie Foster plays Clarice Starling and she is amazing. Oscar-winner Anthony Hopkins did a great job as Hannibal Lecter and boy, is he so amazing in that part. Ted Levine and Scott Glenn are amazing as well, but the rest of the cast is amazing as well.This film is the reason why I put Hannibal Lecter on my Top 10 Favorite Horror Movie Killers list and I think this movie deserved all of the critical acclaim and praise and those five Academy Awards it was nominated for.Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter appears on the AFI 100 Years: Heroes and Villains, Starling appears at #6 Hero and Lecter appears at #1 Villain.The script, music and other production values are all good and amazing and I don't think a single person can hate this film.THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS gets a 10 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
My favorite movie ever.,"It dumbfounds me how I only saw this movie for the first time in May of 2001, when it had been out since very early 1991. They plug the stuffing out of this movie on almost every TV show, especially those running around the time of this movie's release. So finally, I rented it from Blockbuster, expecting good things, because it won 5 Oscars, has Jodie Foster(who has since become my favorite actress and dream wife) in it, and it's notoriety. I got more than I asked for. Jodie Foster plays Clarice Starling to the ""tee-est"" of ""T's"". Young, beautiful, determined, brilliant, vulnerable. Hopkins scares and intrigues me simultaneously, amazing how I would never want to be in the same room as Hannibal Lecter, yet would not mind terribly if he sat down next to me on a park bench. Hopkins calculated every movement, every speech, and basically brought Hannibal Lecter to life in which maybe no other fictional character has been brought to life, made a part of human consciousness. In 2010, he will face Keyzer Soze for the title of the most feared movie villain ever. This and ""Fatal Attraction"" have the distinction of being the only two films to ever scare me, frighten me, seriously unsettle me. I own the movie, am soon getting the DVD, and am sorry ""Hannibal"" was not as good as this. Movie deserved every award it won, and the infamy surrounding it is no accident.

#1 Thriller of our Time!!!,"There should be no questioning why Sir Anthony Hopkins & Jodie Foster won Oscars for their roles in Silence of the Lambs. Hopkins as Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter is terrifyingly superb portraying the fiendish & super-intellectual imprisoned psychiatrist. Hopkins speaks eerily, never blinks, & commands fear from all those near him. Foster as FBI trainee & former farm orphan Clarice Starling gives a very convincing naive, wide-eyed, & reluctantly courageous young woman faced with finding a sadistic ""Buffalo Bill"" serial killer & getting to know the infamous Dr. Lecter. Both actors make you believe in their characters & leave you further engrossed in the movie.SOTL is the story of a manhunt for a serial killer dubbed ""Buffalo Bill"" because he skins his ""humps"" or victims. FBI trainee Starling is summoned by Behavioral Science Dept. guru agent Jack Crawford to make a visit to Baltimore Psych. Hospital & talk to its most famous patient, Dr. Hanibal Lecter. Starling is briefed on the physical procedures used with Lecter by conceited & aloof hospital director Dr. Frederick Chilton, who Lecter despises. After a brief encounter with Lecter, Starling uses the doctor's clues to find a patient of his, also a victim of the serial killer. The decapitated head is that of Benjamin Raspell, who Lecter knows intimately. Lecter gives Starling clues to catching the killer as long as she provides him with very personal information about herself. Starling is warned about Lecter's devious ways but decides to cooperate with him to get more clues. After more victims & a U.S. senator's daughter kidnapped by Buffalo Bill, Starling is on a race against time to save her from certain doom. Starling goes to W. Virginia with Crawford to examine the body of one of Bill's latest victims. Starling discovers a object forced into the girl's throat which happens to be a moth, scientifically known as the Death's Head Moth. After Starling & two entomologists index and identify the pupa, she discovers the moth is a grisly calling card. Starling also finds the same moth pupa in the head of Benjamin Raspell, a former patient of Lecter & lover of Buffalo Bill. With Crawford leading the way & Lecter agreeing to guide her for favors, Starling follows the trail to Memphis, TN., where she meets the Cannibal on last time to pick his remarkable brain for clues. Lecter makes a deal with Memphis authorities & Senator Ruth Martin to assist in identifying Buffalo Bill in exchange for access to books, etc. & an annual trip to Plum Island for a short retreat under S.W.A.T. team surveillance. Starling speaks with Lecter shortly as she is escorted to a plane back home by Chilton & Memphis police. Lecter makes his move by ordering a 2nd meal consisting of extra rare lamb chops in Starling's honor. Lecter upchucks a small metal object behind a screen in order to free himself of handcuffs used by police to enter his make-shift cell. Of course, Lecter escapes confinement by trickery, kills the policemen guarding him, & makes his way out of trouble posing as a wounded cop.Starling stumbles upon a surprised Bill at his home who must either run from or kill the young trainee. Starling prevails by killing Bill, saving the Governor's daughter, & graduates from Quantico at the delight of Agent Crawford. Lecter, now on the loose & following his nemesis Dr. Chilton, licks his chops at the notion of ""having an old friend for dinner"". Lecter slyly walks the streets abroad to surprise Chilton with his usual ""calm sociopathic demeanor.""SOTL will scare you, surprise you, & make you remember Hannibal Lecter for days to come.

"Fear and Pity in ""Silence of the Lambs""","This movie has special meaning for me. It was the first scary movie that I ever saw -- and I wasn't supposed to see it. I was ten years old and performing the role of Patrick Dennis with Shani Wallis in ""Mame"" at The Candlewood Playhouse, when one night in the dorm where all the actors were staying, I convinced some of the older actors to let me watch it with them.I've never been so scared in my life (a close second would be when, at the end of Sarah Connor's quiet and somber monologue that opens Terminator 2: Judgment Day, a cyborg's foot is seen and heard crushing a human skull).Anthony Hopkins' acting throughout the movie is a master class in how to choose one, specific action to punctuate your lines. He does not do much standing there in his cell -- and in fact, at Jodie Foster's best moments, she is as still and specific as he is. It's almost that crisp commitment from both actors more than anything else (the plot in general) that induces both the fear and the pity we experience watching the movie. At the beginning, we fear Dr. Lecter, and we pity Clarice on her task to track down the current criminal Buffalo Bill from interviewing the evasive and experienced psychopath in his cell...but because of the specific and simple acting and a great script, that dynamic certainly shifts, and by the end, our original assumptions are perhaps tossed aside.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

It is true that the afformentioned genre has not been overly exploited, and in view of a collection of films described as having ""a questionable degree of merit"" that is probably a good thing.Jodie Foster is excellent as a trainee FBI agent, but her performance is a little overshadowed by that of Sir Anthony Hopkins in the role of Dr Hannibal ""the Cannibal"" Lector. A lot has been said about Hopkins' portrayal of the cannibalistic serial killer, and as I'm limited for space all that I can say is that after seeing the movie, Lector seems a more believable character than Hopkins himself (that's a compliment by the way).In short, an extremely effective movie, and one that has for many embodied the cinema of the '90s.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

It's 2 hours long but it doesn't feel that way because of how engaging the story and characters are. A huge reason why this film succeeds are the performances. Jodie Foster is absolutely fantastic as Clarice Starling and managed to garner herself an Academy Award for it. However, one person who makes this film really memorable is Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter. With less than 20 minutes of screen time, Hopkins' portrayal of Lecter is phenomenal. His tone, expressions and way of delivering dialogues is very unsettling which makes Lecter one of the creepiest villians to ever exist.Apart from the performances, The Silence of the Lambs is exceptionally well made. Jonathan Demme's direction is terrific. Ted Tally's screenplay is filled with excellent dialogue that fleshes out each character to the fullest. The editing is really good. There isn't a single dull moment and the dark tone is consistent throughout which keeps you on the edge of your seat. Tak Fujimoto's cinematography creates such an eerie atmosphere to the world it's set in and the camerawork is filled with excellent shot choices. Whenever Clarice and Hannibal are together, the use of close-ups is applied effectively as it heightens the intensity of the scene. My only issue is the lighting during the night vision scene at the end but it's a very minor flaw that can be overlooked.The Silence of the Lambs is a 2 hour thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat.

I like how a B movie director struggle against time and budget to make a piece of entertainment.. I liked the first two Jason movies and that first Freddy movie.. they have the suspense of a B horror movie.. they are true B movies.

I don't know exactly what kind of help an investigator would ask for a jailed man.. but it is what the movie is based on.

He doesn't tell everything once, he gives her hints about the serial killer whereabout.. so she gotta come over and over again to him to beg some more hints.. it is stupid, I know, but that is one the most praised movies ever.It is like asking a jailed Freddy Kruger to fight Jason because they can't defeat him.. it is something like that.. if you make a real analysis of that sh*t. And it is not a thriller at all, and has a lot of highly laughable absurd bits.Unfortunately it created a trend people seems to like too much.. the super serial killer movie pretending to be a serious one, not a B movie which it indeed is.",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Will the lambs break their silence?,"""The Silence of the Lambs"" is truly a masterpiece. It's a thriller that requires brains to figure out the twists and turns. It's not a mindless horror movie either; the horror elements are very psychological and tend to be disturbing. Furthermore, the film is almost exactly like the novel of the same name.I really love the characters in the movie because they stayed true to the characters in the book. Jodie Foster played the role of FBI rookie Clarice Starling in a very realistic setting, and Anthony Hopkins played his role as the cannibalistic Hannibal Lecter superbly. Both characters were very convincing, thanks to the powerful performances done by Foster & Hopkins.The cinematography is outstanding. Everything about the background imagery mentioned in the book sprang to life in this film. Some locations look very beautiful, while others are downright creepy.The theme music throughout the movie is good and scary, enough to make your nerves tingle. There are also little scenes where familiar popular songs are featured.To conclude, this is a very rich film and sticks to the book very well. It is just as enjoyable as the novel.I give this film a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Disturbing, to say the least","Silence of the Lambs (1991) C-118 min. D: Jonathan Demme. Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, Scott Glenn, Ted Levine, Anthony Heald. Suspenseful detective yarn about an FBI trainee whose only way to track down a notorious serial killer is to ask for help from another one, the infamous Hannibal `The Cannibal' Lectar. Pretty good mystery/thriller has some disgusting subject matter (even for the TV version, which is what I viewed) but hits home in a bravura finale. RATING: 7 out of 10. Rated R for graphic violence and gore, strong language, adult themes, and disturbing subject matter.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
an overwhelming fascination,"Silence of the lambs is honestly the best movie I've ever seen... I saw it for the first time when I was at the age of 14, I watched it with my mother an I remember, that I was afraid of it after watching... Until now, I saw it for the fifth time and now I get less afraid than fascinated by this movie... Hopkins acts in such a great way, that you feel disgust at Hannibal Lecter on the one hand and an overwhelming fascination on the other hand... In this movie you can find a great tension, cruel stories but also there is this relation between Lecter an Clarice... Lecter is Clarice's enemy and a kind of ""friend"" or ""admirer"" of her at the same time... Silence of the lambs is really a movie you HAVE to see !",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
It rubs the lotion on it's skin or else it gets the hose again,"The silence of the lambs is one of the creepiest ever made. However, I say that in a good way. It is the type of scare that doesn't pop out of the corner, but instead it get's into your head and plays around with you. That is the type of scare that i want to see in a movie. Buffalo Bill is probably one of the most messed up movie characters ever made. It rubs the lotion on it's skin or else it gets the hose again, is the line that I say to my friends and they get creeped out (he also does a ""dance"" in front of his camera). Hannible Lector, played by Anthony Hopkins, is the greatest villain ever in cinema history (it's true because the American Film Istatute named Hannibal the number 1 villain of all time).

"If you haven't seen this movie, it's about time. If you have, there is no need for you to read this review","Once in a while a movie comes along that just blows you away, and this is one of them. The performances - ALL of them - are downright brilliant, from the unsure, yet aggressive Clarice Starling, her controlled superior Agent, the insane Buffalo Bill (by the way one of the more haunting movie villains...he'll come to you in your dreams ;) and, of course, Hannibal Lecter. What can I say about Hannibal - he is the reason why you watch the movie another time. I said Buffalo Bill is haunting. Well, if that is true, Lecter is the stuff that nightmares are made of, and yet, in a strange way, you want to have dinner with him (preferably one that you cooked yourself). A fascinating character that you wish to see more of, and actually have the feeling to see more than you actually do - He has a total on-screen time of about 15 minutes. Fun Fact, I believe that's the shortest on-screen time that ever brought an actor an Academy Award.To sum up the rest, the storyline is compelling, has enough creepy moments to be classified as a horror thriller, and was followed by a bunch of movies that desperately want to be ""the silence of the lambs"", but are not. In my opinion, and I only include this because another reviewer stated the opposite, it is by far superior to ""Se7en"". If you haven't seen this movie, it's about time.

An All Time Great Thriller,"""Silence of the Lambs"" is profound in all aspects; there's a reason it's in a rare class of films that essentially swept the Oscars. The acting in this film is nothing short of spectacular, Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter displayed an all time classic performance as maybe the most profound serial killer ever in cinema. As he aired only a total of 16 minutes in this 2 hour masterpiece, it was Jodie Foster who was the glue with a brilliant performance as a young but courageous FBI trainee summoned to catch one serial killer by interviewing another.

Slaughtering the spring lambs...,"If the hype surrounding this movie wasn't enough (yes, I know I'm late to the party) the entire premise is captivating. I don't know what it is about gruesome murders and dark serial killer psychology, but I am one of those people with a sick fascination. Anthony Hopkins played his role to perfection, especially when paired with the wide-eyed innocence of Jodie Fosters' Clarice; the Oscar nominations were not a mistake.I did fall back on the familiar action of yelling at the screen as characters were kidnapped or revealed personal information to serial killers, but in my book that's a good sign. I was engaged and enraged; how could these women be so seemingly stupid?! How could these security guards be so lax in their jobs?! Why would Clarice venture so far into that house without any kind of back up?! (Speaking of which, I have NEVER been as scared watching a film as I was during that dark basement scene...) All of the outrageous decision making made me fall in love; I am a sucker for wild drama. The story could have continued on and on and I would not have complained. In fact, my only critique is that I would have liked to have spent more time with the characters; gotten to know them on a personal level. This is a film packed full of intrigue, justice, redemption, unfinished business, odd relationships, and Jodie Fosters' amazingly 90's hair.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Anthony Hopkins delivers a staggering and realistic performance as Jodie Foster compliments his 'lead' in every way possible. I can't wait for Red Dragon. Definitely one of the most thoroughly enjoyable films I've ever seen. Since seeing it, I've gotten the moth (from the DVD cover) tattooed on my back. The movie itself enchants me. There's a fine line between genius and insane, Hannibal walks it without stumbling.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Brilliant masterpiece, and utterly unforgettable!","A few years ago I tried to watch The Silence of the Lambs but there were many distractions and I was unable to follow it properly. Having had Red Dragon delivered to me accidentally (my own fault, through not cancelling the order) and thinking it was brilliant, I decided to invest in The Silence of the Lambs. And I am delighted that I did. It is the best psychological horror/thriller I have ever seen, and Anthony Hopkins is undoubtedly one of my favourite actors, especially after seeing his first class performance in this film. He has such presence on-screen, a real intensity, and fantastic chemistry with his co-star Jodie Foster. He completely underplays his character, largely only talking for the majority of the film, yet you cannot help but watch him in awe when he is on the screen. I also found - and I'm sure others did too - that I was unable to hate Hannibal Lecter. Despite what he has done, and seeing what he is capable of, Hopkins's portrayal of him makes you think that somewhere inside him he is capable of feeling, and his developing relationship with Clarice shows this. What also makes The Silence of the Lambs exceptional is it's surprising lack of violence and gore. There is only one scene that some may find disturbing (but it had to be in there somewhere!), but other than that it is the gripping storyline, and the wonderful acting that keeps you glued to the screen. The Silence of the Lambs does not need to rely on the cannibalism issue to interest people, and when you think about it, the film is not really about cannibalism. Hannibal Lecter is a serial killer - oh, and he's got a taste for cannibalism as well. Perhaps the only reason it is remembered so much for this is because - in my opinion - no other film has managed to use this subject in an effective way. There would be nothing entertaining in seeing bloody, gory images of someone cannibalising someone throughout an entire film. A good storyline is needed to make this kind of film work, and that's exactly why it does work - it's brilliant in every way, and I cannot fault it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Great film worthy of its hype but a lot of hidden meaning,"This is a great film that has a lot of hidden meaning. Especially that for women's rights. In the way that Clarice Starling is treated unfairly. This is really a film about overcoming adversity. Their is plenty of scenes which detail this perfectly. One is when she is running with her friend at the FBI compound when a group of males go running by and give them looks of ""What the hell are they doing here."" The way Hannibal Lector will only talk to Clarice a woman mainly I feel because it is a different approach the FBI used. This main fact is covered up by the fact that Lector likes her or has a crush on her. Another is when she is doing training at the FBI compound when they run into the place to secure it Clarice messes up and is told that she is dead and he looks at the guy and says you did great, but to Clarice he says you messed up. The scene of the film which details my point is the scene in which they are at the funeral home in which all the police are meeting and Scott Glenn's character tells the other police officer to come with him into the other room to talk details, this way Clarice can't hear them and then Clarice looks around to see herself surrounded by men. All in which are giving looks of ""What the hell is she doing here."" If you pay attention closely this is repetitive throughout the film. One scene in which Clarice overcomes her ""disadvantage"" which don't get me wrong is not one but detailed in the film this way is when doing an autopsy of the body, Clarice yells at everyone to leave. They listen to her and leave. She actually cracks a smirk in this scene, to almost say to herself ""I did it."" Of course we all know the ending of the film, where the women was right and all the men at the other place were wrong. She overcame her adversity and succeeded over the men and is also shown at the award ceremony at the end where award ceremony says her name first as opposed to the male name next. Scott Glenn's character is a closet sexist. This is a great film once again and deserves all its credit but watch close for these details throughout the whole film. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Story Would Benefit from Minor Adjustments,"Many aspects of this film are masterful. Such as the acting, dialogue, cinematography, interactions between characters, and the characterization of its main antagonist. 1991's ""Silence of the Lambs"" also offers subtle commentary on social class, depicts the prevalence of misogyny in male-dominant careers, and shows how a young, aspiring agent navigates through that.If we hyperfocus on just the overall story itself-it hinges on the idea that that an incarcerated serial killer has information that will lead to the whereabouts of a wanted serial killer. It never quite offers an explanation as to how investigators originally arrived at this conclusion, and I think leaving this fact ambiguous for the sake of this film's scope was simply a mistake.Hannibal Lector is an interesting villain, and I would have liked to know how investigators arrived at the conclusion, for reasons other than a hunch. You cannot just say ""They're both cannibals, therefore are both similarly deranged, therefore must have known each other at some point"", as a means to suspend my disbelief. That's just non sequitur. Minor tweaks would have resulted in a much better story.I still applaud this film for the ideas it had at the time.

Everything with Hopkins is great but otherwise...,"Everyone remembers Anthony Hopkins' delicious take on an epicurean monster and they should since its good enough to hold the whole the movie, near enough...But asides from these startlingly well written little monologues it's remarkable what a bland movie this otherwise is. I have an issue with any narrative that at its centre just follows law enforcement tracking down a killer. It leaves very little room for any meaningful development of either the plot or the characters, no matter what the details of the case, it always treads a familiar path. A big part of a story for me is what motivates the main character but with these kinds of things the answer is ""it's their job"" and Jodie Foster laying on the Saccharine about a bunch of farm animals only strikes me as a contrived way to humanize a basic, taciturn character type.The movie is obsessed with suggesting there is some type of spiritual connection between Hannibal and Clarice, but it is entirely an informed attribute.

Gimme Gimme Shock Treatment..,"Watching The Silence Of The Lambs again some 30 years later, you come to realize it's greatest strength being, is that it is an 'actors piece'. This is what raises the picture up to it's still seminal and legendary status today, whilst the background story, events and supporting cast can seem slightly dated and diluted, due to the sheer number and diabolical content offered by thrillers since its inception.Both lead performers have weathered and survived the years immaculately however and is primarily the root source of why this film still holds up as strongly as it does.Both are exquisite in their creation and to watch.The haunted house finale is a bit wobbly and unreasonable even back in 1990 but probably not enough reason to carp.I don't think, in regards it's honouring, the Academy sweeps the thriller/horror genre under the rug in so far as accolade, more like a case being that films of undeniable excellence such as The Exorcist and this one are just so few and far between.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The silent lamb,"Looking back twenty years later, the focus is no longer on Hannibal and Foster. The relationship between Foster and her mentor really attracted me. The silent lamb is actually the female protagonist herself, and the mentor happens to be the one who suppresses her (there are several psychological hints of male dominance in the film). His hypocrisy is manifested in three aspects: firstly, during the funeral, he avoids telling the female protagonist the case, and then hypocritically explains to her to wash his own white; Secondly, when the female protagonist was searching for clues, she called her supervisor and heard that he had already used special forces to arrest someone. Only then did she realize that the supervisor had not mentioned the progress of the case he had mastered to her and did not trust her opinion at all; Thirdly, at the celebration, the mentor was not proud of her at all, but rather lost interest and left early. These details strengthen the identity of the silent lamb of the female lead. Without Hannibal's appearance, who would have cared about the feeling of 'her', which is also the foundation of the entire film. On her first visit to prison, the ""inmate"" next to her molested her with semen, but who would have thought that Hannibal would kill him the next day, allowing the two of them to rely on her spiritually.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The story is original and never goes stale, all of the characters are interesting, the dialogue between the bright, young Clarice Starling and the maniacal, manipulative Hannibal Lecter is phenomenal. Hannibal Lecter is one of the most terrifying characters in film due to his extreme intelligence and disturbing habits. The camera work in this movie is also outstanding, especially toward the climax of the film, when the florist is ringing the doorbell; that's all I will say as to not give it away, but it throws you for a loop. Who can forget the eery ""Goodbye Horses"" tune with the infamous dance? The climax will have you on the edge of your seat, just waiting to jump.

"Play on your fears, meet the psychopaths !","Directed by Jonathan Demme, based upon the novel by the same name by Thomas Harris (1988), the movie takes us through a journey of psychopath minds: the way they think, the way they justify their crimes (even to themselves), the methods they use, and how the FBI works to catch them. The movie has the seriousness and intensity that has been entirely lacking in horror movies lately. It features two serial killers, one who is an imprisoned criminal, Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), the other one nicknamed as Buffalo Bill by the FBI. Clarice Starling(Jodie Foster), a top student at the FBI's training academy is set upon the assignment of investigating Buffalo Bill, who kills young women and removes the skin from their bodies for purposes not revealed(Spoiler alert!).He is an amateur, has his weaknesses and can be caught, although only someone who has begun to think like him can defeat him. Clarice is advised by her boss Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) to interview ""Hannibal the Cannibal"" Dr.Lecter, to find out any leads to track down Buffalo. Lecter being an interesting character throughout the movie, is a prize-winning psychiatrist turned a killer and cannibal who gently manipulates her mind and plays on her fears. The intimidating intellect of Hopkins' character is also reflected in his abundant wit, which he uses to provoke and torment his jailers and later confuse the forces to get away. He remains an unrepentant killer, almost as dangerous in his cell as he is on the loose. With his cunning facial expressions and amazing telepathic performances, he's the monster as genius, and Hopkins plays him with disturbing authority. Cinematography and screenplay have very well put the seriousness intended by Harris in his novel. A tale of bloody scenes, suspense, deception, manipulation and a masterpiece for those longing to watch horror movies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Great script, extraordinary acting, bit of a subpar directing","Let me preface this review by saying that I just watched the silence of the lambs for the very first time. I've known a few famous quotes like the ones with the Chianti and the very last one with the dinner but didn't know the exact ins and outs of the story.I love a lot of things about this movie. The characters are very human and even though sometimes extreme in their behavior no caricatures. They're realistic through and through and without an agenda or messaging about them.Clarice starling is a great protagonist. Since she's new to all of this we can sympathize easily with her as we experience all of this kind of things for the first time as well. She might lack experience but not the smarts. However, Hannibal Lecter as a character is mesmerizing. He's cunning and cold but very charming and even though it's the stupidest thing to do you start to root for him. Their portrayal by Foster and Hopkins deserve every accolade you give them.Story wise, it's a straightforward detective thriller with some minor twists and turns. But the way it involves the viewer into its secrets letting them trying to piece things together is great, as well.The only negative I've got is concerning the way some things have been directed. Some editing decisions made some scenes feel rushed or choppy. I didn't like some camera angles. All just very minor things that just weren't my taste and I've known from lesser 90s movies that I've grown up with.All in all, a classic worth to be watched for at least the acting of two powerhouses.

Glorification of psychopaths,"This is another movie that glorifies psychopathic behaviour. The bad guy is portrayed as an intelligent, witty, stylish, calculated guy while the investigators are shown as weak-minded, emotional, imprudent persons. One almost feels sorry(or maybe angry) for the FBI guys for being so incompetent. How can the screenplay for such a movie get 5 Oscars? The acting is not that great either, Anthony Hopkins is overplaying his lines while Jodie Foster is barely acting at all. She doesn't seem to change mimic during the whole movie and the whole story with the lambs is just lame. Some psychopaths are known to be good to animals, so saving some lambs doesn't automatically make you a noble and unique person, someone that can make the world a better place.",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Silence of the Lambs: 8/10,"I think it's gotten to the point where most people don't really care about the Academy Awards anymore, because they're not for individual achievements, but for appreciating an actor or a film because it cost a lot of money. But back before those days, when the Oscars meant something, it was a huge honor to win the five major Academy Awards-picture, actor, actress, director, and screenplay. The Silence of the Lambs is the third, and most recent, one to do that. Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins won acting awards, Jonathan Demme won the directing award, and Ted Tally won for best adapted screenplay. Was it deserving for all of those awards? For the most part, more or less.Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins), a serial killer/cannibal who has the identity and the whereabouts of notorious serial killer Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), is being interviewed by rookie FBI agent Clarice Starling (Foster) for information on Bill. But Lecter's more cunning and demented than first glance, and has fun playing with the mind of Starling as she's interviewing him.Since I don't really know what to say about this movie, I'll go my fail-safe way and go over each award it won and why it should have won for that reason. The screenplay, based off of the book by Thomas Harris, has a slow build-up (one that originally turned me off), but as soon as Lecter is introduced, it's paid off. The script takes us inside of the head of Lecter, making him one of the most interesting celluloid characters of the 1990s. The screenplay also doesn't really waste that much time with unimportant characters, although a little more on Jack Crawford would have been nice. But the screenplay is tight and holds together well, throughout the hit-or-miss directing career of Demme.Demme won an Oscar for best directing. I have mixed feelings about this one. On one hand, many scenes in Lambs aren't boring, but not really that exciting or involving. He does have some good style (I love that night-vision scene), and does build up some good suspense as the movie comes to a close. The suspense is laid on thick at the end, and I suppose it makes up for the still entertaining but not thrilling rest of the movie. Demme does set up some mystery, too, as we follow Clarice's adventures. There are also some very disturbing scenes (""It rubs the lotion on the skin or else it gets the hose again!""), which fit in with the tone of most of the movie. Disturbing, yes, but actually impacting? Not really.Both Foster and Hopkins won acting Oscars for leading roles. Foster's character, as I said before, began as being annoying to me, but soon became a person I could tolerate. But was she deserving of an Oscar? A nomination is even a stretch, mainly because of that awful accent of hers. Hopkins was great, but with total screentime being around 16 minutes, he was more of a supporting actor (although, I guess the awards were crooked then. They wanted to give an award to both Jack Palance for City Slickers and Hopkins, but they were both supporting roles). I think we got the gist of Hannibal in those 16 minutes, and Hopkins put in a memorable performance in that time.Lastly, Lambs won best picture. Is it the best picture of 1991? I'm not sure, I haven't seen every film from 1991. But it's a damn good one.My rating: 8/10Rated R for language, violence, and disturbing themes.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The Silence of the Lambs,"This is a brilliant screen adaptation of the Thomas Harris book with a cast impossible to improve upon. Anthony Hopkins plays ""Hannibal Lecter"", a murderous sophisticate with a penchant for eating the evidence and Jodie Foster as the novice FBI agent sent to try and elicit his help in tracking down a killer with a similar modus operandi to our now incarcerated ""Lecter"". The menace with which Hopkins portrays the role is spine-chilling.

Nothing special at all,"Very overrated movie, in my opinion. Not really bad, but nothing special either. I really don't understand what all the fuss is about. The story is only so-so, with a few logical holes. For example, why should one serial killer be able to understand another serial killer better? It really makes no sense to me. The acting is good, but nothing special either. I believe it is only so very popular because it broke one of the last taboos (cannibalism) in a mainstream movie. But that is not enough for a good movie. I admit I am a bit old fashioned about movies; for some things it is better if they are not shown but only hinted at.

The Silence of the Lambs in an incredible movie. I highly recommend it.,"The Silence of the Lambs is one of the greatest horror movies I have ever seen. I absolutely loved it, even when I first saw it at age ten I loved it. Anthony Hopkins is so incredibly intriguing, and without him, Hannibal Lecter wouldn't be anywhere as capturing as I find him to be in the Hannibal Lecter trilogy. Hannibal and Red Dragon are also great. Manhunter I didn't like nearly as much as any of the others because of the not having Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Lecter. Hannibal is my favourite out of any Hannibal Lecter movie or book because it shows him free. That is my main reason. You get to see what the doctor is like without bars in front of him. I recommend The Silence of the Lambs as well as any other Hannibal Lecter movie to anyone that enjoys horror movies, but then again I have been told over and over that I have an obsession with the Hannibal Lecter movies and books.

Beautifully horrific,"I am not familiar with the books upon which this is based and I only really knew about this film due to heavy amounts of praise it has received especially regarding the performance of Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter who is now seen as one of the greatest movie villains of all time. Is this praise justified? Absolutely!Silence of the Lambs is a fantastic film that digs deep into the human mind and it does it's absolute best to leave the viewer unsettled. The cast is fantastic all around with the bulk of praise going to Jodie Foster and of course Anthony Hopkins. Every scene Hannibal is in is mesmerising and every line of dialogue keeps you hooked. His and Jodie's chemistry on-screen is fantastic and each learn more about each other in every conversation. The supporting cast also does an excellent job at selling the drama.The cinematography and soundtrack by Howard Shore really enhances the eerie atmosphere to absurd levels keeping the viewer engaged until the very end. The imagery is truly unsettling but somehow not overbearing to the point of desensitizing the viewer.The script is fantastic and dialogue scenes between characters, especially with Hannibal, are so memorable and iconic and the discussions give a fair amount of food for thought and everything the audience needs to know is delivered efficiently.Overall, this film deserves every praise it gets and while I personally would likely need a long break before I watch it again, it is undeniably a masterpiece in the psychological thriller genre and I would highly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

One of the greatest thrillers of all time,"I read somewhere that Anthony Hopkins has little more than 15 minutes actual screen time in a feature that runs just under two hours. For me, whenever Silence of the Lambs is brought up I instantly think of Dr Hannibal Lecter. This speaks volumes for how much of a powerful and memorable performance he gives as one of the best villains of all time, despite only featuring for around an eighth of the movie. His performance/character is faultless and gives a completely different approach to so many other villains we see in the movies, he is calm, well educated, has an intelligent vocabulary, witty sarcasm and is brutally honest. But on the other hand he is also intriguing, disturbing and very uneasy to watch. The greatest thing about him though is how he is caged off from the world in each of his scenes, like a monster, he isn't accessible and comes across as untouchable. The most baffling thing of all though is that despite Hopkins playing a serial killer cannibal who is criminally deranged, you actually have a strange sense of fondness towards him. At one point I felt myself feeling sorry for him, how is that even possible? Hats off to the creators and Anthony Hopkins for that to give the viewer that feeling, quite the achievement!Jodie Foster gives an incredible performance and this is easily my favourite out of all the roles she has played. She plays a young, trainee detective who is extremely vulnerable and is struggling to deal with the demons of her childhood. Buffalo Bill is a serial killer on the loose and the FBI are running out of time to catch him, Jodie Foster's character is sent to visit Hannibal Lecter to do research into the mind of a serial killer. She visits him in his confined mental institute where he is serving his life sentence. Hannibal Lecter starts to mentor Jodie Foster and the few scenes we get of these two, either on opposite side of reinforced glass are some of the most intense but somehow touching scenes I have experienced.The plot is perfect and stays very grounded, it knows what it wants to be and it stays true to itself throughout. It doesn't get over complicated or take any unnecessary risks, it simply does what it needs to and the actors do the rest with their fantastic characters and script. There is one scene in particular that stays in my mind when thinking of this movie and It is very tense and disturbing but shows us just what we need to see, it isn't overly gory for the sake of it. This is what Silence of the Lambs does so well, it is very graphic yet it doesn't make you want to look away in disgust, instead it connects with you very well.Silence of the Lambs has it all, it has a solid plot, characters with depth and development, incredible acting, tension and a great script. All it needs in my opinion is some more screen time for Hannibal Lector as he really is a faultless villain but then on the other hand the way he is used is subtle and could well be more effective because of this. Silence of the Lambs is one of the greatest thrillers I have seen and it deserves all the awards and accolades it has received over the past 24 years.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Foster, Hopkins, and the film itself are all great","This is another film in which so many aspects of it have been written, critiqued, and analyzed that I seriously wonder why I am even bother writing a review of it. Based on the best-selling novel by Thomas Harris, LAMBS is film that manages to successfully play to both cerebral and visceral senses without slighting one for the other. In other words, those looking for an intelligent psychological thriller will be rewarded with an articulate script and strong performances, while slasher fans will reveal in such genre staples as a transvestite killer who skins bodies. Jonathan Demme's taunt direction ties all the elements together flawlessly, and delivers outstanding performances from his stars.Jodie Foster brings her innate intelligence and charming naiveté to her role of FBI agent Clarice Starling, and she should receive major kudos for portraying her character's strength as stemming from her brain rather than any pumped-up Sigourney Weaver-esquire physical prowess. Anthony Hopkins also delivers a tremendous performance that and belies his relatively brief screen time with immense effectiveness. He is so menacing that it feels like he's everywhere, even though he is only on-screen for roughly one-fourth of the picture. Scott Glenn and Kasi Lemmons are fine, but underused - this is the Foster and Hopkins show all the way! The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences were certainly fans of the film, as SILENCE OF THE LAMBS swept the Academy Awards, deservedly winning Oscars in all five major categories. This was only the third film in history to do so.A perfect motion picture.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Since no one else is ever going to do as good at the role so even trying to do so is a futile effort.Jodie Foster starred as young FBI agent Clarice Starling who goes to the facility that Lecter is being held to interview him to get help find another serial killer, Buffalo Bill.Silence of the Lambs is one of the few movies to win the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director(Jonathan Demme), Best Actor(Hopkins) and Best Actress(Foster).One of the best suspense movies ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Caged Lambs,"Movie adaptations of novels, even pop bestsellers with the imagery masticated for us, are a tricky business to cinematically get right.

Rare birds like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" transcend previous visual understandings, and overpower the written word.You can include this movie with ""Presumed Innocent"" or ""...Cuckoo's Nest"": in each case, the wrong path was chosen.The novel hinges on Lecter's perspective -- here Hopkins plays a mere boogey man. All we get is the cheap device of haunted houses.In the novel, Lecter moves physically and psychologically wherever he wants: in Harris' words, 'as if he chose the distance' from the protagonist/detective. He occupies his own universe of perception, based mostly on sight and smell -- Demme might have really done something by recreating the world sensed by Lecter. Instead, he spends all of his time lovingly gazing into Foster's face.If you want a better construction of a world, stay with ""Manhunter"".",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Jodie Foster is sent to the depths of psychological terror as she interrogates imprisoned serial killer Anthony Hopkins in the hopes that he might lead her to  serial killer at large, Buffalo Bill.","Silence of the Lambs is a well constructed suspense/thriller taking us to depths of the human psyche that are repugnant to the Christian soul.  And while we turn our heads and hide our eyes at grisly demise and naked evil, at the same time we are intrigued by the motivations and actions contained therein.  Jodie Foster plays the role of Clarice Starling with a hardened vulnerability which surfaces in her encounters with Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins).  The first time I watched the movie, I was engrossed in all aspects of it- the disappearance of the senator's daughter, the mystery of Buffalo Bill, and the terrifying aspect of Hannibal Lecter.  But in successive viewings, the part that stands out the most is the interaction of Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins.  It is this interaction that allows this movie to transcend the genre of suspense/ thriller and defines a class unto itself.  Lecter uses his finely tuned manipulative instincts to peel away the layers of Starling revealing the closely guarded motivation for her entire life's work.  He delves beneath her mask of coolness and self sufficiency revealing her inner vulnerability.  And somehow, while revealing the most intimate secrets about herself, she still manages to deceive Lecter and gain the upper hand- if only for awhile.While this interaction is the core of the movie, there is a plot, and it is a very good one.  For what I have outlined thus far could easily be a romance, but the twist is Hannibal Lecter is a serial killer with a very loose sense of morality and Jodie Foster is an FBI agent whose moral code is strict and uncompromising.  And while Lecter is peeling layers from Clarice Starling's walls, he is chilling us with his icy demeanor- describing how he loves to eat human liver and fava beans- and leading Starling on a merry hunt for clues to the name of the elusive Buffalo Bill; who has captured another victim with time ticking away.  In summary, the greatness of Silence of the Lambs lies in its ability to bring the demons of its heroine's past and intertwine them around a complex suspense/mystery, and keep the audience interested the entire time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Silent of the Lamb!,"Entertaining and worth watching once. Great cast but the plot has too many holes.

Kinda boring,"Somewhat an inferior sequel to ""Manhunter,"" we find Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) assigning FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) to interview Lecter about killer Buffalo Bill, who has been kidnapping young women throughout the southern United States.Much like ""Manhunter,"" this movie focuses on the investigator. However, Clarice Starling isn't nearly as interesting as Will Graham. She thinks she's one of the big boys, but hasn't done anything to prove herself and actually shows herself unworthy of that recognition.Anthony Hopkins, replacing Brian Cox, hams up the role of Lecter, taking away a bit of a creepy edge. Jodie Foster proves that accents aren't one of her talents. Scott Glenn is once again great in a small role.The movie unwraps slowly, but without worthy characters, we don't find ourselves interested in what develops. The movie doesn't really pick up until the climatic confrontation.A year after this movie's release, ""Basic Instinct"" was badly received for its perceived homophobic content. However, ""Basic Instinct"" only had a killer that happened to be a lesbian, where ""Silence of the Lambs"" creates an explicit link between the killer's killing and his sexual confusion, definitely making it the more homophobic of the two.It's a good story of a young woman's growth, but it's not compelling or thrilling.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Boring without Hopkins,"This is the first time my opinion vastly diverges from the public one. For me this is just a plain movie, no suspense, no fear, boring at times and just confusing at others. The saving grace is Hopkins which acted amazingly. Foster on the other hand...is just annoying with her accent and general demeanor. She truly was like a lamb when speaking to Lecter which might be intentional but is just annoying. I also get that the shots were filmed in a way to make the space look smaller and more close up to amp up the anxiety but there were so many cuts, close ups etc. that again were annoying. I didn't feel anything during or after the movie which would justify the ""phycological thriller or horror"" title.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A great creepy thriller !,Silence of The Lambs is a real creepy little thriller . In my opinion it's one of the best thrillers ever made . Anthony Hopkins appears in his first and most effective performance as Dr.Hannibal Lecter aka Hannibal The Cannibal . And Jodie Foster plays Clarice Starling the FBI agent in training who hopes to catch a serial killer nicknamed Buffalo Bill with the help of Lecter . Both Hopkins and Foster are great and they truly deserved the Best actor/actress oscars . The rest of the cast is also very good.Director Jonathan Demme puts his money on suspense rather than blood and guts and yet he shows violence in a brutal way when it is called for which is certainly a very good move .Adding to the creepiness is a good score by Howard Shore.,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Hopskins is excellent in one of the best displays of acting talent ever. You look in Hopskins eyes and you can see pure evil, and his taunts are bone chilling.  Hopkins is pure evil, and Hannibal Lecter is a classic villan.  Jodie Foster is great as Clarice Starling the haunted FBI agent interviewing Lecter to find a killer named Buffallo Bill.  Foster is purity taken back by the literate and charming tongue of Hospkins.  This movie is pure genius and if you haven't see it run to your nearest video store now.  For a 5 time Oscar winner that deserved every single award it won.  I can't wait to see Hannibal.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Really good serial killer thriller. One that won't soon be forgotten.,"This movie is one that will live in film history. After garning five Academy Awards, it began many shining careers. Scott Glenn was really good. It was nice to see him as a younger person. The same thing with Anthony Hopkins. He looked much younger (because he is). I especially enjoyed the scenes with Ted Levine who plays Buffalo Bill, the serial madman that Agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is assigned to find. I heard on some documentary and on the IMDb trivia page that Buffalo Bill was a combination of three real life killers. Ed Gein, Bundy and some other guy. I also heard that Jodie Foster was creeped out by the making of this film. Which is probably why she chose not to do the sequel, HANNIBAL. The film creates an eerie and chilling mood all by itself. It lets us know that something this sick and twisted has actually happened. All the performances in this film were great. Just about everyone I know has seen this movie. So, I would assume that if you are reading this review, that you have too. So, I'm not going to recommend that you see it. I'm going to recommend that you see it again. If you want a good scare, see this movie again. Maybe if you haven't seen it in a long time, it will creep back into your memory and scare the hell out of you. Hannibal's escape scene was classic. I'm sure you all remember it. THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS: 5/5.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
An amazing psychological thriller which takes you through all the emotions. A classic.,anyone who has seen this film will probably agree with me that this is probably the best film of the 90's. It has an amazing plot and it adds classic horror with a psychological thriller. I personally think this film started a new era of horror because before it was always mad thick psycho's but this had a super intelligent slightly witty phycho. The biggest move in horror since 'Psycho'.,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"A great film, worth watching.","Now don't get me wrong, I liked the movie a great deal, but I really can't understand why this movie has such a high rating and is so high on the IMDB top 250.  I guess I just can't seem to place what this film has that other films of the same nature don't have.  But, like I said, don't get me wrong, I thought this was an excellent film.Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins were fantastic in their respect roles and really had some great chemistry between their characters.  The supporting cast members, Anthony Heald, Scott Glenn, Ted Levine, and Frankie Faison were very good as well.  Also, the directing of Jonathan Demme was excellent.I thought the story was quite interesting and very well done.  The film is rarely boring and keeps a good pace throughout the film.  But keep in mind that this film is rather graphic in certain scenes.  There is an R rating for a reason.I would definitely recommend this film to anyone that enjoys a good crime-triller or liked the previous Thomas Harris adaptation, ""Manhunter"". Seeing ""Manhunter"" is by no means a prerequisite to this film, but it may be a good idea to see it first and/or the recently released ""Red Dragon"" (a re-make of ""Manhunter"").  If you do get around to seeing this film, I hope you enjoy it.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
definitely deserving of those Oscars...,"I had always been putting off watching ""Silence of the Lambs"". Everyone always said I'd never sleep again (or something along those lines). Granted, they said that about ""Jaws"" and ""Psycho"", too, and I wasn't...completely...freaked out by them. Then a few weeks ago I watched ""Red Dragon"" (what can I say, I'm Norton/Fiennes fan). I thought it was very interesting -- and it caused me to ask myself, yet again, why I haven't seen the original Lecter-a-thon. So I finally watched it, and I am very, very glad I did.I think that it is considered so great, not necessarily because of the writing, but because of the other beautiful aspects of its production. The cutaways added much appreciated suspense (as did the music...and acting, of course), the closeups pulled you closer into each character's world, and, much like ""The Shining"", the filmmakers were able to make the most open spaces seem the most confining and ""scary"".I immediately noticed the difference between ""Lambs"" and its sequel-prequel ""Dragon"", most notably the effort involved. All of the actors WERE their characters, and everything seemed so wrapped up in the environment (in a good way).Although this movie does not make it to my favorites list, I thought it was very good (the quality more than anything), and I recommend it to everyone - well, unless you hate bugs.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Unlikely,"this movie is just implausible... i know movies do not need to always reflect reality to be entertaining or good, but this movie rode the ""realistic"" trump card at the time of its release... i'm sorry if i don't believe the FBI would field an investigation in remotely the same fashion as the one in this movie... hopkins hams up his performance as lecter, and i cannot buy into him for one second...i admit i have a faint bias against jodie foster but i still think this movie is irreparably damaged by the unlikeliness of the story... it's further hamstrung when you consider the BRILLIANT portrayal of lecter (who is not a very realistic character but wow! does cox do a good job bringing him to life) by brian cox in the older and superior manhunter... i think it's a mistake to give lecter the amount of emphasis he gets here, as he should not be the focus of this story...if there is any redemption, it's the fine, almost secondary performance of ted levine... he acts in a manner i might expect from a serial killer, and is at least somewhat interesting... too bad he plays second fiddle to a pointless, distracting and inexplicable main story...when compared this to similar serial killer thriller movies (ie. movies that ground themselves in fiction and twists) this film comes off rather badly to offerings like the bone collector, which is just a good old fashioned yarn...

great suspense flik!!!,"since i first saw ""The Silence of the Lambs"" when i was 12 years old, i have been terrified. This first time i laid eyes on Hannibal Lector questioning Clarice Starling about her unfortunate past, i knew i was hooked. The pure evil he held in his eyes has captivated me since. Jody Foster should now be considered one of he greatest female movie detectives of all time. She provided an excellent view into the life of a struggling student with real skills that was able to overcome her previous experiences. I now consider ""The Silence of the Lambs"", not only my favorite horror/suspense film of all time, but just my flat-out favorite.

The Standard for all Suspense films to follow.,"On my own personal list of greatest films of all time, I rank this one as the 5th.  Sir Anthony Hopkins, one of the greatest actors in history (and a relative of mine..I am Welsh and he is my distant uncle) and can play any role and turn it into an Oscar-worthy performance.  Dr. Hannibal Lecter, the second greatest movie villain of all time next to Lord Darth Vader, was so convincing that he more than deserved the Academy Award.  I am glad that he will reprise the role again. Jodie Foster was so good in her role of Clarice Starling that I am glad that she won the Academy Award.  She should come back for a sequel. More praise should go to Ted Levine.  With the exception of the nude shot, he was incredible as Jame Gumb, a.k.a. Buffalo Bill. I think it was interesting how he kept refering to Catherine Martin as `IT' instead of `SHE' OR `HER'.  Very convincing.  As I said before, a sequel is WAY overdue.

The first film that ever made me puke,"This film is the most bad-ass movie I have ever seen. Everything about it is so good. You have the scene in which Buffalo Bill pretends to be handicapped and the victim is nice enough to try to help him before he knocks her out and checks her bra size or whatever and says in that creepy low pitch voice, ""Mmm, perfect..."" You have the classic escape scene in which one guy gets in in the face with some mace, that was pretty gruesome. You have the scene when Buffalo bill does some hardcore crotch folding action. You have the scene where his victim kidnaps his poodle. This film also has a scene in which I puked in which Jodie Foster is outside the bathroom door and busts in only to find the skinned corpse of a girl in the bathtub that has noticeably been there for years, before the lights go out. I almost passed out when I saw that. That was a true gross-out horror movie moment. This film is truly a suspenseful and perfect film that will be remembered as one of the most twisted serial killer films ever.

Ordinary movie lifted by one extraordinary performance,"For me, this movie was a pretty blah experience. That it managed to grab the top five Academy Awards is a mystery to me; 1991 must have been a truly dismal year for the movies if the Academy chose to honour this rather average offering. I've been really anxious to see the film after I've heard so many good things about it, and as I sat through the first rather unremarkable half-an-hour, I kept saying to myself: ""Ok, it should get brilliant any time soon now... shouldn't it??"" But it didn't. It wasn't involving, it wasn't chilling or scary or compelling in any way. I usually adore Jodie Foster, but here she gave an unremarkable performance and I didn't care for her character one bit. Anthony Hopkins almost saved the movie for me with his truly brilliant turn as Dr Lecter, but I felt that it was a supporting role at best.

Hannibal Lecter's America,"The subtext of Silence of the Lambs is phenomenal considering it is the work of Jonathan Demme.  He is not a creative person, but it is a blessing that this movie lacks any subtle directorial touches.  The focus is on the actors, not the circumstances.  This is evident in Howard Shore's score, a mix of the conventional horror movie and the old school thriller.  It is not particularly pompous, but it doesn't need to be.Jodie Foster attempts to be deep, if it weren't for Demme's camera she would be nothing more than a decoration.  Her accent is just a distraction from her actions, by golly I hated it.Anthony Hopkins is the dominant feature of the entire film.  More than him, it is his character.  Hannibal is certainly one of the 10 deepest characters ever created for film, he has superseded Hopkins himself.  Notice how the camera loves Hannibal and he loves it back.  Hopkins will never be better despite recent efforts to eclipse his role.  Hollywood has tried cashing in on Hannibal Lecter's persona, but never understanding the context enough. Gore doesn't substitute for script.The final parody, of course, is the way Demme presents America as either a victim or something hidden in a closet.  The apparition never gets to see the light of day because it is constantly being snuffed out at night by the forces of evil.  Maybe he was being prophetic in his primitive mind.Given the documentary style of the film, it is interesting how much attention is given to Jame Gumb.  Had he been absent more often, I'm certain it would've helped the suspense, but one must wonder ahead of time where the story is going.  We can guess what Clarice is going to do ahead of time, but what about Hannibal?  That is the fault of the editors, but Silence of the Lambs is certainly better edited than Batman or Empire of the Sun.  It is gruesome, not for titillation in the fashion of Friday the 13th. Rather, it is present for the sense of realism.  Might I add that this is one of the most disturbingly dark movies ever made.Overall, a well-deserving winner of Best Picture (for once I agree with the accursed Academy of fools) that stands out in its genre.  Horror will never be the same.  I would have preferred if Foster didn't have that nagging accent, but that's a small price to pay for a lack of a message in the film. Geometrically superior to its so-called 'sequels'.  4.5 out of 5 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Excellent as high level psychological drama (but the book is better),"All right you guys.  It's simply not appropriate to compare Silence of the Lambs with its 'prequel' Manhunter (Red Dragon). SOTL is a high level psychological drama targeted for the big audiences with top actors--with minimal procedurals. Manhunter is more of a procedural with attempts at psychology and targeted at a different (and smaller) audience with a virtually no-name cast.  Each does its job very well, but its really unfair to compare the 2.  After not getting to play Hannibal the cannibal in SOTL, I am glad to see Brian Cox getting other juicy (albeit smaller) roles, usually as the villain, in other action/suspense movies.  As far as the novels go, Red Dragon is better written, but SOTL has a superior (virtually perfect) ending.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Muting of the Mutton,"This movie is the perfect example of the magic that can happen when you have a great script,superb actors and a director who can make it work.  Unlike its sequal Hannibal, which was too over the top with its movement lacking cohesion, unessary and confusing artsy/fartsy b.s., violence and gore that it left the plot and characters involved weak and under-developed while the prequal-sequal Red-Dragon although a descent piece of work did not go the extra mile to really develop the characters and the story itself was much too ""similar"" to the story-line of Silence to stand out on its own as being anything other than ""what you might expect"". Silence stands on its own as a dramatic and meaningful peice of cinema with a well developed plot and deep charactars that pull you in and take you on a chilling thrill ride.  This is one of those great movies that stick with you and stand the test of time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the best book adaptations in film history and the epitome of a psychological thriller,"With The Silence of the Lambs, Jonathan Demme laid the foundation of all psychological thrillers to come after it and also accomplished a contestant for one of the best book adaptations in film history, as he transformed Thomas Harris's entertaining and thrilling novel of the same name into a visionary, absorbing, and stereotype-defying motion picture that deservedly ranks among the prestigious trio of films to have won the Big Five categories at the Academy Awards. It's one of the very few thrillers (not horror films, as asinine Hollywood likes to classify it) that improves with time, similarly to the Chianti Hannibal Lecter mentions in the essential The Silence of the Lambs quote, as it's neither a whodunit nor a howcatchem, but rather a study of psychopaths' and serial killers' twisted states of mind.For doing so, Demme actually has two at his disposal, though only Anthony Hopkins's shockingly stoic and sophisticated cannibal counts among cinema's unforgettable villains. This film's actual antagonist, Buffalo Bill, is quite fascinating himself and contributes to some outstanding scenes, but gets a disappointingly amateurish exit, one of the very few flaws The Silence of the Lambs has. While I'd not call it a flaw, Jodie Foster as the film's protagonist is a bit overrated in my book, being a relatable and strong heroine that manages to bear up against Hopkins, yet not having overly interesting features herself. The contrary is the case with the film overall, that may not satisfy viewers looking for a good scare, but is a masterful look at human emotions and, if that's not your cup of tea, also a splendid psychological thriller.Another important factor contributing to making The Silence of the Lambs a classic is its visual appearance, most inventive in the parallel montage of a FBI squad kicking in the door of Buffalo Bill's suspected lodging and Clarice, alone, knocking on the door of one of Bill's acquaintances and the showdown, seen through night vision goggles. Because of all this, The Silence of the Lambs can very well be called the epitome of a psychological thriller and is setting the bar for films of this genre until today, more than twenty years since its release.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
has aged poorly,"Silence of the Lambs is one of those films in which a very formidable performance(s) overshadow the flaws and weaknesses in that film. No one questions or doubts the performance by lead actress Jodie Foster or more specifically the outworldly turn by Sir Anthony Hopkins whose Hannibal Lecter is a regular figure in pop culture. First time watching, I was so engrossed by these performances that I couldn't pay much attention to anything else, but after a rewatch, I have some troubles with this film.To start, I'd like to mention that this film has not aged very well. The truth is in nowadays woke Hollywood such a film would never be greenlighted. Considering that this film was made in 1991, I just can't shake the mipression that this film was regressive. Besides that notion, I also didn't particularly like the music utilized in here, I think this film was one of the last thrillers that used a classic orchestral score before moving forward to a more synth/techno based sound that suits much much better for such a film.I also despise the absurd fetishism with pop psychology this film represents. In reality, psycholists don't tend to eat human livers and are not spoiled narcissistics. Psychology is a term we often associate with trying to heal depression, anxiety and personality disorders, not so much about cannibalism and manslaughter.Overall, had not been for the excellence Anthony Hopkins exudes, Silience of the Lambs were already all but forgotten.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Basically garbage,"Well, I had only seen this film once, back in high school, and was quite drunk the first time, so I didn't remember it very well.....so, I thought I'd check it out with its new ""special edition"" release and see what all the hoopla is about.  I mean, it was named Best Picture, it has two excellent lead actors (Foster and Hopkins), and it's gotten nothing but praise and good ratings on the IMDb site, so why not take a look?Here's why:  it was very poorly shot.  The script was a pretty good idea, but very, very predictable and formulaic.  Foster's performance was overstated, and, while the Hopkins role was very well-done, every single other character in the film was VERY poorly played.  The dialogue was ridiculous.Half of the movie was shot without any actual ""acting"" going on; people were just talking to the camera in close-up, and their editing was supposed to make us feel like these people were actually having an exchange of some kind (does anyone think that Foster and Hopkins were ever on the set together, simultaneously, at any point?).The actual villain of the film, ""Buffalo Bill,"" is given no background at all except for a few very unrealistic newspaper clippings, from which we are expected to gather something.  This is the equivalent of countless crappy Lifetime movies establishing past relationships between people by panning past photographs of people standing together, while piano plays in the background.  This guy isn't frightening, menacing, or even suspenseful in the slightest.The largest amount of actual entertainment in the film consists of how all the cops act.  If the rest of the movie weren't so poorly made, I'd like to think that the director was making them so comical and silly on purpose; maybe trying to make a point of some kind.  But, judging from the rest of the film, Demme probably thought he was portraying these people accurately.""Silence of the Lambs"" isn't one of the worst movies ever made, but it is certainly much farther from being one of the best.  All the little details thrown in, the ones that actually let us see just what the director is actually doing with the film, are stupid (like the cat waiting in the window when the girl gets kidnapped----it growls as the van drives off.......ridiculous).  What little action there is in the film is purely by-the-book, industry-standard, average garbage (save for the scene where Hopkins grabs the guard and sucks his face---that was far below average).If you've never seen this movie, but you've seen some other detective/killer/suspense film sometime in the past 20 years, don't bother. It's certainly not up to the level it's touted at.  If you saw the movie once, while in junior high or high school, and you think maybe your film tastes have matured since then, watch it again.  I think you'll see what I mean.I just can't imagine what the people (those that consider themselves to be knowledgeable film critics) were thinking in 1991.  Best Picture.  Doesn't speak well for the other movies released that year.  I wonder.........",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Thriller for Thriller haters,"This film is supposed to be scary, and it is.  The tension throughout is unbelievable.  However, unlike others in the ""thriller"" or ""horror"" genre, the horror is never gratuitous or hard to take.  As such, being a hater of this genre, I only got around to watching this several years after it was made.  Now I wish I had seen it before.Unlike the villains who cut and slash in the standard horror films, we understand that the psychos in this film have motivation.  You actually feel empathy for these people, even the man who doesn't have any - Hannibal Lecter.  You feel sorry that this obviously cultured, intelligent and, yes, dedicated man is trapped not in a prison, but by the fact his brain can't stop him from carrying out the worst things he can imagine.  As such, this film sheds as much light on the criminally insane as any twelve films that could be made about Charles Manson or any of his ilk.  Demme actually tries to understand what makes Hannibal the man he is, and in the end we start to understand as well.Add to this an excellent plot, engaging characters, and ""good guys"" that seem more out of it than the villains and you have a must see movie even for the most squeamish.That being said, I hope the sequel can live up to the original.

In order of increasing odiousness: 1. Catherine, the rich, loudmouthed senator's daughter. Whatta bitch! She would have done better as a capacious frock. 2.

Sir Anthony Hopkins was incredibly chilling in this film and its one of the few films that does send tension and chills through my spine.Both Foster and Hopkins deserved the acting Oscar for their roles- Foster was so perfect as the brilliant but vulnerable Starling. Its a shame that HANNIBAL could not beat this film.It deserves a higher ranking on this list than 26!10/10H xxxxxx,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I adore this movie!,"I adore this movie! Amazing acting, thoughtful plot.""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a chilling masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of traditional horror and thriller genres. Directed by Jonathan Demme and based on the novel by Thomas Harris, the film weaves a gripping narrative that keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end.At the heart of the film is Anthony Hopkins' mesmerizing performance as Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a brilliant yet monstrous psychiatrist imprisoned for his heinous crimes. Hopkins' portrayal is hauntingly compelling, delivering lines with a chilling charisma that lingers long after the credits roll. Jodie Foster shines as Clarice Starling, a young FBI trainee tasked with advising Lecter on how to catch another serial killer, Buffalo Bill, played with unnerving intensity by Ted Levine.The brilliance of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" lies not only in its nail-biting suspense, but also in its exploration of complex psychological themes. It delves deep into the psyches of its characters, especially Lecter and Starling, unraveling their motivations and fears in a cat-and-mouse game that is as intellectual as it is terrifying.Demme's direction is meticulous, creating an atmosphere of dread and unease through skillful cinematography and a haunting score. The movie's pacing is impeccable, building tension with each scene until it reaches a heart-pounding crescendo in the unforgettable climax.Beyond its thrills, The Silence of the Lambs is a thought-provoking exploration of power dynamics, identity, and the darkness that resides within all of us. It challenges viewers to confront their deepest fears while questioning the nature of evil itself.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"""A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti.""","The Silence of the Lambs is about a young FBI agent named Clarice Starling, who is assigned to save a missing woman kidnapped by psychopathic killer with the help of another killer. The Silence of the Lambs is one of the best films of the 90's and the best of 1991 by far. The acting is the main reason why this film should be looked at. Jodie Foster, Ted Levine, and especially, Anthony Hopkins have excellent performances and they make this Oscar winner, a great one to watch. The screenplay written by Ted Tally is excellent and the rich dialogue, gave Anthony Hopkins's 19 minute screen time an Oscar, mainly because of his greatly used dialogue. The directing, cinematography, and soundtrack also made this an enjoyable and fantastic film to watch. I highly recommend it!Quote of the movie: ""A census taker once tried to test me.

Great acting,"The Silence of the Lambs, a chilling masterpiece of suspense, is a cinematic triumph defined by its mesmerizing strengths. Its exceptional acting, notably Jodie Foster's iconic portrayal of Clarice Starling and Anthony Hopkins' bone-chilling performance as Hannibal Lecter, is nothing short of brilliant. The film's cinematography expertly builds tension and dread, immersing the audience in a world of psychological horror. The haunting score and meticulous visuals further contribute to its unsettling atmosphere. While some might find its subject matter disturbing and its pacing occasionally slow, The Silence of the Lambs undoubtedly deserves its 8/10 rating as a gripping and unforgettable exploration of the darkest corners of the human psyche, leaving an indelible mark on the thriller genre.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
good!,"With Silence of the Lambs comes some much needed recognition for the horror genre. It is a first- rate production all around. It boasts a witty and suspenseful script based on the Thomas Harris novel, full of great lines. It has marvelous direction from Demme. Demme creates suspense very well throughout and uses some great directorial shots such as the twin frames of Clarice ringing a doorbell and the FBI men breaking into a home. The two lead actors won Oscars for their performances...each deserved. Foster is very good in her role, but it is Anthony Hopkins that literally lights up the screen with his complex portrayal of a complex serial killer. Hopkins does the seemingly impossible. He frightens you with his outrageousness and yet illicts some pity/compassion(albeit not a lot) for his situation. He says his lines with reservedness when needed and brashness when needed. The rest of the cast is also quite good with Anthony Heald a standout as a unethical, petty doctor in charge of Hopkins. Of course the story of the other killer is very very chilling as well. A quality film in all aspects!",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The story gives a peep into the minds of the hardcore psychopaths.The play of anagrams, the creepy tones and dialogs of Hannibal Lecher are too good to miss.

I rewatched it the other day after watching the one with Julianne Moore as Clarice and forgot how good the silence of the lambs is!

"Already legendary, and deservedly so...","You realize you're in a different sort of thriller when Clarice Starling walks down that corridor, trying to ignore the cat-calls of a cell-block full of lunatics, only to find that the most dangerous inmate on the block is standing calmly in his cell, waiting for her, almost as if he's welcoming her to a cocktail party. Rare is the movie that gets everything right, but ""The Silence of the Lambs"" comes awfully close to providing the perfect example for a modern thriller. It's so disturbing to watch for some people that it's often described as a horror movie, which says more about other films involving serial killing, in my opinion, than it does about this one. We're not used to crime thrillers that actually show killing and its aftermath in gruesome, clinical detail-- ""The Silence of the Lambs"" does. We're not used to films showing us psychopaths of unnerving ferocity-- ""The Silence of the Lambs"" does. Most importantly, we're not used to seeing this kind of story presented in such a matter-of-fact way-- ""The Silence of Lambs"" is never showy in its camera work or its performances.

The best part is definitely the part when Straling is interviewing Lecter, this partis not only scary but very interesting. Buffalo Bill on this film is also scary.

A Few Random Comments,"Not a movie to see before a big dinner or on a bad day. No need to echo main plot points here; instead I'll offer a few random remarks.By now I've got Foster's lovely face and pursed lips memorized thanks to director Demme's succession of close-ups. But then the movie is as much about her coming to grips with her childhood through the lens of maniacs as it is with the sheer horror. Anyway, I hope they paid her triple. The flick comes off as A-grade menace, though I do think it could have been tightened, especially Clarice's endless blast through doors at Bill's voodoo house. Unfortunately, the sheer repetition tends to weaken the in-built suspense. On the other hand, was there ever a scarier lunatic than the self-possessed Lecter (Hopkins); his unblinking stare could awaken an iron statue. No wonder Lecter's listed as an all-time horror figure. Then too, (in passing) Buffalo Bill's donning of murder victims' skin reminds me of the infamous Ed Gein of rural Wisconsin. Back in '57 he tried to bring back his dead Ma by donning skins of graveyard cadavers and his murder victims. He's best known now as inspiration for Hitchcock's Psycho (1959) where lunatic Anthony Perkins tries a similar dead-skin trick to bring back his dead mom. Anyway, Silence remains a classic with many memorable scenes and audible shudders despite the decades.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A thinking person's horror movie!,"An FBI operative seeks the help of a convicted serial killer in the search for one still active.This film features some very good acting. Not great acting, mind you, because the roles don't involve evolving before our eyes. The characters have evolved before they hit the screen.Thomas Harris is one of the cleverest novelists around. He is both a good writer and a clever writer: Plenty of good writers write novels about subjects that don't engage the general public, but are well written and deserve to be read. They write for a small audience and, if they are lucky, sales keep the author fed, sheltered and clothed until the next one comes out.However Harris is also a clever writer in that he chooses the material of cheap thrillers (serial killers - zero points for originality!) and writes about them with the care and attention that is normally reserved for our friends in the former paragraph. The subject is taking him to the top of the ladder - not his care with words.There is something slightly bizarre a-foot here. This is a film based on cheap thrills and tension, which I could live with if the reviewers (of all colours) weren't so precious about it all.This film takes a lot of time and trouble over minor details and yet major plot lines are clearly S-T-U-P-I-D. Actors sit in on FBI lessons to learn technique and procedure then Agent Starling goes and visits Lector ON HER OWN!(Yes isn't it amazing how quickly common-sense - no matter the FBI rule book - is thrown away when it gets in the way of an easy tension device!)There is a lot right with this film and a lot wrong with it too. Thrillers have no other role other than thrill and thrill it does, but I hate the authors coded references that only he and a few PhDs/crime authors can understand. Private jokes are snobbery.(I am glad that IMDb have a trivia section for this movie it answered a lot of my questions. With Harris every ""stray"" phrase has a story behind it.)Killer Lector is a bit like Huggy Bear in Starsky and Hutch. He knows everything about everything and it is a shame he is not the policeman because all serious crime would be solved in five minutes! Yes we have to have some device for throwing these people together (however silly), but how does he know all this info from his well guarded cell. Is he on some private ""serial killer"" bulletin board?(""Hey guys - that woman that was sliced up in to six pieces in Houston -- that was me...."")A lot of people got a lot of enjoyment from this film and I thought it was quite good too, but it is also slightly sick. The subject matter is worthy of our attention, but I am uneasy about it being served up as ""great art"" and given Oscars.This about as much ""great art"" as the musical Grease. Take away the horror movie stunts (or film them in a more benign way) and it would have flopped at the box office.Also to be noted is that this is a ""strong woman"" picture - if Agent Starling was a man most women would have marked it a point or two lower than they have. I hope that isn't read as a sexist observation.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

In addition to Hopkins and Foster, excellent general direction decisions stand out, an adapted script that covers the best parameters of cinematographic suspense including unexpected turns and overwhelming silences.

My Favorite Film Of All Time,"""The Silence Of The Lambs"" is an incredibly gripping psychological thriller that leaves you on the edge of your seat all the time. The film is about a very vulnerable FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) who is sent by her instructor (Scott Glenn) to go and seek out information from a very brilliant and psychotic imprisoned serial killer named Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) on tracking down another serial killer known only as ""Buffalo Bill"" (Ted Levine) who skins his victims. Soon after Starling and Lecters interview Buffalo Bill abducts 25-year old Catherine Martin, the daughter of the US Senator Ruth Martin. Clarice soon after tells Lecter that if he tells them who Buffalo Bill is in time to save Catherine Martin the senator will transfer him to a better prison. The acting in this film is superb, Foster and Hopkins have great chemistry together they also won Oscars for there roles. Ted Levine also gives a phenomenal performance, he plays Jame Gumb perfectly. This film has some of the best scenes ever showed on film. the climax of the film of the film was done perfectly it lasts for about ten minutes and it leaves you on the edge of your seat and biting your nails.

Disturbing and powerful,"Jonathan Demme's masterpiece stands out as one of the greatest films of all time. It is distinguished in every aspect. The direction, the writing, the acting... all superb. It captivates, disturbs, and fascinates the viewer. This is a film that plays on the senses; on fear, on imagination, and on emotions.The director's visual style paints a dark, bleak, yet colorful world that depicts the ugly side of humanity. The story itself is phenomenal. It is intriguing, unsettling, and is told so effectively. The cast is its strongest point. They are what make this film unforgettable. Anthony Hopkins is a powerhouse in this film, dominating the role of Hannibal Lecter, with his leering stare and his creepy demeanor.Yet there's a charm and wit that draws you in. You forget that he's a psychopathic killer. Jodie Foster is incredible. She gives her character so much depth. She disappears in her role with her subtle mixture of strength and vulnerability. Ted Levine deserves more recognition for his role as serial killer Buffalo Bill. He is so disturbing and appalling in this film. He gives a chilling performance.The scenes with Foster and Hopkins are undeniably the strength of this movie. Hopkins picks away at Foster's inner demons, forcing her to open up her troubling past. In exchange, he reveals more and more information on the identity of a notorious serial killer. Foster's desperation does nothing to budge Hopkins from his request, and her vulnerability is more and more present as their scenes progress. They are both remarkable in this movie.I highly recommend this classic if you've never seen it. It hasn't aged at all, in my opinion. The failed attempts at cinema today make this film even stronger today than it was in 1991. It is truly a masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Amazing Movie,"A really great film that everyone should take out the time to watch at some point in their life. We've watched this multiple times in the film program at USC. It's a great film to break down and understand the basic tenets of movie-making and storytelling. One of the best parts of the film, in my opinion, stems from the adept chose of shots. We are brought into the intimate world of Agent Sterling. We not only learn about her past through the perceptions of Lector, but Jonathan Demme, pulls into a world dominated by the sexual nature of men, and it's viewpoint from the eyes of Sterling. Rather than opt for simple wide, medium, and close coverage the director chooses to give us the vantage point of the main character, especially through the copious amounts of POV shots taken throughout the film. This is only heightened when you realize Demme wanted the audience to appreciate the perspective of a woman in an environment where men are prominent and dominant.

""The silence of the lambs"" is the third and last movie up to date to have garnered the four major Oscars: Best picture, best actor (Hopkins), best actress (Foster), and best director (Demme).  The one thing that might make the fact that this movie won these four Oscars all the more exceptional is that contrary to  ""It happened one night"" and ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"" which are a romantic comedy and a heavy drama, ""The silence of the lambs"" is a high-scale horror-movie.FBI agent Clarice Starling (Foster) is assigned to track down a serial killer who calls himself Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine).  The only problem she must confront however is that to catch Buffalo Bill, she must consult with Hannibal ""The cannibal"" Lecter (Hopkins) who is an ex-psychiatrist renowned across the country.

However, Lecter will not cooperate unless Starling lets him in onto some of the details of her private life.Incredibly gripping and frightening, ""The silence of the lambs"" is one of those rare thrillers we see.

The Greatest Of Thrillers,"I felt extremely satisfied and for sure disturbed after my first viewing of this compelling and eerie thriller. This is the pinnacle of dark, disturbing, and smart thrillers. A classic in its own right, some of the most memorable scenes are featured in The Silence of the Lambs, as are some of the quotations. Make no mistake the film is no horror, not really; but it's so creepy, haunting and unforgiving it might as well be one. The film has some wicked camera shots and angles, a great actor to character dynamic, and is purely a masterpiece from start to finish. The writing, acting and directing are, to put it simply, amazing. It is astounding that Sir Anthony Hopkins gets a bit more than 15 minutes of screen time and it is still a mesmerising portrayal of Hannibal Lector. I love Hopkins' portrayal as Hannibal. Much to my surprise watching for the first time only a few years back, the film didn't only revolve around him, but also the serial killer, Buffalo Bill, whose creepy expressions and voice and overall movement/mannerisms and the whole night goggles thing certainly added to the thrills that this engaging, meticulously crafted, horrifying and magnificent thriller leaves you with from the minute it starts. Movies these days suffer from lack of imagination, banality and if they're horror they rely on jump scares and forced shock schlock, again, if they're horrors or close to said genre, or tedious writing to execution or they suffer from lack of good setup into satisfactory payoff.. Or they forget what they're doing or what it hopes to achieve half way through or at its end, or they even suffer from lack of a good narrative in general, which is sad. This doesn't just mean thriller, or horror, but all of film, from action to crime. I think The Silence of the Lambs is a perfectly executed, performed, written film that absolutely achieves legendary status, achieves everything it sets out to do (without trying) and is so utterly and effortlessly captivating. The pacing, camera work, atmosphere, acting, writing, directing and music are all excellent. No weak or tiresome moments or out of place character or writing. I would love to come across a thriller so terrifying as this one, (Well, Seven comes close). I get nervous watching this. I get creeped out. I get panicky and a feeling of claustrophobia or dread. I get the thrills. I get lost in it. I embrace it and I never get bored. I didn't finally see it until just three years back, since then I've seen it at least eight or nine times. If there were just one classic thriller and terrific movie you should see in your lifetime, make it The Silence of the Lambs. I highly recommend it to anybody who loves this genre of film, films in general and loves a good fright and chills every now and then.It rubs the lotion on its skin and does whenever it's told.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

There are many more horror movies WAY better than this. This one is just okay. There are other movies other than those three I mentioned released in 1991 that are way better than the silence of the lambs too but maybe less classy which made them be seen as less Oscar worthy to whoever decided on what Oscars went to who.

"Moral and Ethical Vs Immoral and Unethical characters, or the Silk Worm Vs the Merchant","In The Republic, Plato puts the tale of the ring of Gyges in the mouth of Glaucon, who uses it to make the point that no man is so virtuous that he could resist the temptation of being able to steal at will by the ring's power of invisibility. In contemporary terms, Glaucon argues that morality is a social construction, whose source is the desire to maintain one's reputation for virtue and honesty; when that sanction is removed, moral character would evaporate.What is the screenwriter trying to tell the audience other than another gruesome tale of human nature. The entertainment of the doctor, Hanibal Lecture, must be as equal to the thrills of the audience. Just as the good doctor hears the evils of man baptized by the oath of Hippocrates he is obligated by the oath to remain secret. At least until that oath can be legally dealt, and still due to personal intelligence the details not recorded are his duty to disclose.Almost like a shield that mirrors his own reflection his conscience maintains his own character, but it consumes him. This reminds me of the scene from Superman II as well during the hour of judgment of the State criminals. Where they become imprisoned in a mirror for their crimes. Was it really three different criminals or just one with three personalities of a mute, military general, and women.Just as the beginning of this analysis ancient myth of human nature could play on many aspects. Perhaps the reason for the use of the Deaths Head Moth being placed in the mouth. Or, based on history of film this could be the screen-writers reference to Der Fanger, 1966. A German movie that deals with a butterfly collector who develops a super-ego of power that deteriorates into a psychosis of mania where he begins to collect women.Myths such as the emperors new cloths may play a significant role. Hence the use of women to make a new image that is respectable. The women are used to conceal the hidden emotions of the dual character of cross-gender nature. Thus the suspect makes a physical outer appearance as apparent as his illness inflicts is physical character.Just as a garment is made from silk cloth at the expense of the moth the image of mentally ill must be at equal risk concerning human virtue. As the story is told and what is known about society and human virtue without both the individual is naked to the morals and ethics of the society. Thus as an analogous relationship just as the moth is destroyed for the sake of the merchant because of the separation of Buddist values and economic values the mentally ill individual destroys women when he truly separates from the moral and ethical obligations of society to promote his own individual image.Actor Anthony Hopkins plays a fantastic role as the doctor. His practice at being cold and clever makes him seem the more distant. This is the exact opposite in his role as Ted Brautigan in Hearts in Atlantis. Anthony Hopkins recently became a US citizen from the United Kingdom. His duty to the UK military and theatrical skills have propelled him in his own career that is highly noted by his peers from around the globe. Good job Anthony Hopkins.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Very intense,"This is one truly excellent and outstanding movie. Foster and Hopkins give unforgettable performances and the movie has a great direction. Jonathan Demme created such an intense atmosphere that the movie was very alive. The script was clever, too, and the camerawork was very well done.Overall, this is one of the truly great movies that will never fade.

Dr Hannibal the Cannibal will stays in memory forever,"Its brilliantly made dark psychological thriller which gave one of the most dangerous character of Hollywood cinema - 'Dr. Hannibal Lecter. The movie is a screen adaptation of best selling novel by the same name written by Thomas Harris. Clarice is FBI trainee goes to interview Dr Hannibal the cannibal to solve the puzzling serial killer Buffalo Bill who skins his victims & keeps them in a pit in his basement. The current captive is US senator's daughter & Dr. Hannibal is the only available clue of the case. Its interplay between Clarice & Dr. Hannibal which made it unsettling thrill ride of 2 hours. As he helps to solve Buffalo Bill case, he digs deep into Clarice's hidden psyche. Every technical aspects of the film are just immaculate & gives you thrill feel from the beginning to end. It's waste of words if I say much about the performances since the film swept the Oscars, winning Best Actor (Anthony Hopkins), Best Actress (Jodie Foster), Best Director (Jonathan Demme), Best Picture, & Best Adapted Screenplay (Ted Tally). This is the third film who won Oscars in all 5 major categories; the other two were- 'It happened one night' & 'One flew over cuckoo's nest'. Hopkins won the Best Actor despite being in the film for about 30 minutes, may be the shortest screen appearance for any best actor winner & that itself proves that Anthony Hopkins has delivered his best in it. I have watched 'Red Dragon' & 'Hannibal' made in the same legacy of this one but after watching this today I must say this will remain matchless classic.Ratings-9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Screaming Lambs!!!,"'The Silence of The Lambs' is a great example of how powerful a film can be when the director, writer, actors, cinematographers and the rest of the crew put their best into something. No one associated with the movie thought that it would win so many awards. The intention was to bring Thomas Harris's excellent chiller on screen. Ted Tally's screenplay is terrific as it forms a structured outline and sets a gloomy tone. Moreover the dialogues are scintillating. Demme's stupendous direction is what makes this meticulously crafted thriller one of a kind. The suspense is well built and the Demme carefully peels the layer relying on subtle cues and conspicuous symbolism. For example, the prison really manages to create that claustrophobic feel.'The Silence of The Lambs' is one of the very few thrillers where everything works. The cinematography deserves special mention. The fastidious closeups, long shots and the actors talking to the camera are formidable. The score contributes to the chilling glum atmosphereThe acting by the main cast is splendiferous. In spite of his small screen time, Anthony Hopkins has a very dominating presence and it is no unknown fact that his Hannibal Lecter remains one of the most memorable characters on screen. Jodie Foster is sublime. In a way, her Clarice Starling created the new movie prototype of a female FBI, a trend that was followed by many actresses (notably Gillian Andersen in 'X-Files'). I loved her spontaneous and natural reactions to Hannibal Lecter's remarks in the prison scenes. The eerie sequences between Foster and Hopkins are among the highlights and the conversations in those scenes are morbidly amusing. Ted Levine is frightening. Scott Glenn and Anthony Heald are competent.'The Silence of The Lambs' is one of the most finely crafted films of its genre. It's definitely stood the test of time and it's one that doesn't get dull with repeated viewing. It's a classic.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Canned Corn,"I really wanted to leave the theater several time during the premiere of this cornball turkey, but I stayed till the bitter end. I was not scared; I was not repulsed; I was annoyed. Grand guignol histrionics, laughable dialogue (""fava beans"" indeed), impossible plot holes, and as mismatched a pair of leads as one could imagine, made this a tedious experience. And the idiocy of a main character whose parents named him Hannibal and he just happens to grow up to become a cannibal. Really? Sounds like an idea Chester Gould would have discarded as corny and unbelievable.While Jodie Foster displays no personality at all, Anthony Hopkins gives an outrageously hammy performance that would make Donald Pleasence wince. In fact, Hannibal Lector eats so much scenery in this film, how could he possibly have any room left for people?The reaction to this dog after I saw it was truly amazing - and very depressing.

Not just a movie - an astonishing expierience,"The only movie that can compare to the tension and suspense of this movie, I think, is Jaws. The same elecrifying thrill and fear you feel every time the shark approaches is mirrored by a terrifying monster in this film, one that also eats people - Dr Hannibal Lector. The popularity of this film was such that I knew the plot when  I was ten in 1991, although I only saw it about a month ago. I will usually never watch films that are disgusting, and I didn't really want to watch this. But rather than being a disgusting horror, it turned out to be a psychological thriller of the highest order. The movie is amazing. It presents a gritty, realistic world like that of a documentary, with no typical Hollywood cliches whatsoever. That way we don't know what to expect. The actors are actors first and stars second, and the two central performances are simply superb. Hopkins is so effective in his role, you could easily believe Hannibal Lector really exists. In fact he is so good, he won the Best Actor Oscar for a supporting role.Even better is Jodie Foster, who has surely proven herself now to be one of the best actresses ever. The most convincing performance I have ever seen. Director Demme skillfully uses angles to make her look small and isolated in a world of danger and fear. Better than Psycho. Better than Jaws.

Brilliant and fascinating,"I have to say that The Silence of the Lambs ranks as one of the best thrillers of the decade.Anthony Hopkins portrayal of Hannibal Lecter is nothing short of remarkable.  The first scene where we see him is beautifully done.  His voice is utterly chilling and he seduces you into liking him, a difficult task. Jodie Foster also gives a great performance as Clarice Starling, sent to interview Lecter in the hopes that it will lead to the capture of Buffalo Bill. Their four scenes together are nothing short of magnificent.  The tension that appears is real, and we feel it.     Jonathan Demme is a director whom I have never really admired.  Now, I can say that I do, and this movie is a masterpiece of direction.  Especially the climax.  He also directs the final confrontation scene between Hopkins and Foster very well.  It plays out a perverse parody of a love scene, and there is a lot of sexual tension (especially when he strokes her finger at the end of it).Simply stated, a great movie experience, and worthy of it's place on the AFI list.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Best in class.,"There're plenty of movies out there. Some very good, some even outstanding and some in a league of their own.

What makes this gem so unique is the combination of getting all aspects of movie making perfectly right. Above all, the brilliant acting. Mr Anthony Hopkins gives a haunting, spectacular and award winning performance. His presence once on screen is both fascinating & bone chilling. Probably the best performance by an actor ever - at least my POV. Same for Mrs Jodi Foster. She plays the part of the vulnerable yet driven and charismatic youngster. The interaction and conversations between them is tense, extraordinary. Underlined by the precise camera work, the atmospheric score and a top screenplay. Overall an experience not to be missed.

Lots of the things that happen that were shocking at the time have been done in other places, and more extreme, many times now.The pacing is a lot slower than I recall - but I guess thats true of many 80's and 90's movies.Lecter is still terrifying and played very well.In the 90's I thought Jodie Foster was very good. I have now downgraded that to ""ok"".The whole movie is much more straight forward than I recall.All the above gripes in mind I'm leaving my stars at 8. In the 90's I would have given it a 10.

Are The Lambs Still Crying?,"This is one of those films that sticks with you. The psychological horror of Anthony Hopkin's Hannibal Lecter is like a thick fog that remains in your head, sticking to the corners of your subconscious in a way too few villains have ever managed. It's one of those career-defining roles that, having seen someone so naturally take it on, you cannot imagine anyone else stepping into. Having read Thomas Harris' fantastic novel beforehand, this was one of the biggest selling points to me. As anyone who has read the book(s) can tell you, Hannibal Lecter is an extremely deep and complicated character that demanded an actor capable of both sophisticated mannerisms and a terrible underlying nature of pure evil. The moment Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling meets Hopkins' Lecter, you can see it all in the intense gleam of his eyes.As a best picture winner, this film was righteously recognized for it's strong merits of precise storytelling, incredible lead acting from Hopkins and Foster and a strong supporting cast, and most of all for truly engaging the viewer in it's atmosphere of horror. The little touches round out the fantastic experience, from Lecter's disturbing facial appliance to Clarice's slow unveiling of her troubled past and Lecter's bizarre way of showing his empathy and affection, all the way to Ted Levine's superb portray of the psychologically disturbed Buffalo Bill.A movie that still gets under your skin all these years later, it's a crime if you haven't seen it. A brilliant film from beginning to end is rare enough, but when it also features a character who was destined to be one of horror's iconic faces, it becomes a legend in the making.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Jodie Foster does a magnificent role and it is not a real surprise. but the dialog with the doctor Lecter of young Starling is one of rare moments of pure fascination , like a game of shadows or trip in the mind of viewer. because it is not exactly a film. but a form of experience. not ordinary but so convincing that it dares be an useful lesson about old things in new powerful light.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
An overpriced movie,"I saw the film a couple of times now, and I must say that I enjoyed each time.But give me a break, 5 Oscars? Yes, Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins are outstanding, but the other 3 Oscars are way overpriced. No way it is in the league of One flew over the cuckoo's nest - both movies won 5 Oscars (film, director, script, leading actor and leading actress). It just doesn't compare.So I began to search for a reason, and part can be attributed to the poorer quality of films produced that year. But the most part is the conservative attitude of the Academy itself. JFK was the big winner for me with all it 's thought provoking acting, lighting, filming and script. Other films overlooked are cape fear and the fisher king. Especially now that a lot of us are complaining that both directors (Martin Scorsese and Terry Gilliam) haven't received an Oscar yet.-since my the original writing, Scorsese has won the Oscar for best director, the departed.-And let's not forget the script written by Ted Tally. After reading the book itself I can't help thinking that he copied the book itself with a piece of tracing paper and cut some minor parts out. There is hardly any change made. But maybe this can be attributed to the writer of the book - Thomas Harris. Surely Talley's effort can't justify an Oscar. Incidentally: Ted Tally hasn't written anything that can support this ""big effort"", any guesses why...The Camera style that Jonathan Demme uses doesn't seem to work for me. The straight in the camera that he uses to intensify the situation is just not right, it's just forcing the situation. He uses the same thing in Philadelphia, but to my opinion that film is overrated as well, although not as much as this one.I give it an 7 out of 10.

Good but not great,"Silence of the Lambs is a horror/thriller film most notable for its character of Hannibal Lector a cannibalistic psychopath played by Anthony Hopkins. Jodie Foster is one of my favorite actresses and she seems a little too vulnerable here to be an FBI agent. Anthony Hopkins, surely one of the world's greatest actors, is suitably creepy as psychopathic Dr. Lector, however, I prefer his performance in Magic; his role is much larger in that movie and he does more acting. Jonathan Demme, also one of my favorite directors, does a good job but, once again, I prefer his Married to the Mob (1988) or Harold and Melvin (1980) over this film. Howard Shore's musical score is terrific. As far as violence goes, Silence of the Lambs might have been shocking when it was release but, by today's standards, it is tame. There are no lingering closeups of violence. The CSI TV series shows much more graphic images. I see why this film won Academy Awards, mainly because the competition was not that stiff. Although it's a good film, it does not deserve the high status that is has been accorded.

This movie does add some dramatic scenes and character development to improve on a poorly written novel. This movie's big draws, it would appear, were cannibalism, masogeny, and over-acting. Really great acting is transparent. If you're marvelling at the fantastic acting during the movie, then what you're enjoying is watching someone ""ham it up"" on the screen, not fine acting. The important thing is that the villain didn't have sex with the women, he just murdered them and skinned them, thus avoiding an x rating. And the females that we were aware of that did have sex were properly tortured for their sins. What I really find offensive is that Hannibal the Cannibal is portrayed as a likable monster, even after cutting off the face of an innocent guard in order facilitate his escape. Hannibal's a winner and American's love a winner, regardless of the atrocities he commits in order to achieve his goals.

No actual lambs appear on-screen in this movie,"Beautiful love story about a convicted murderer and an FBI agent. Anthony Hopkins got a lot of critical praise for his portrayal of the convicted murderer.

Another proof that Anthony Hopkins is the best British actor of all time,"Silence of the Lambs is a movie about the madness and the psychic.This is its greatness.I have watched Red Dragon and Hanibal before Silence of the Lambs and i knew that it won't be better than Red Dragon but it will be much better than Hanibal and i was right.This is the oldest movie of the trilogy but it is a sequel of Red Dragon which was released in 2002.Now about Silence of the Lambs.The plot is about an FBI agent who must reveal the secret of Buffalo Bill-crazy psychopath who is doing weird things with his victims.Her name is Clarice Starling.She finds that Dr.Hanibal Lecter can help her with this case.Hanibal is played by Anthony Hopkins and he is the best thing in this movie.Really his greatest performance.The proviso is that he will tell Clarice about Bufallo Bill and his secrets,only if she tells him about her personal live.Her tragedy is that her father has died when she was young.This is about the plot.Very original idea for recreation of the life of an FBI agent fighting against pure and simple Madness.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

One of the scariest movies I've ever seen in my entire life!,"I've seen a lot of horror movies, but the thing I've noticed is that when you watch a horror movie after a few times, it's not that scary anymore. I've probably watched Silence of The Lambs over 20 times, and every time I watch it, I ""jump"", get startled. Anthony Hopkins is a great actor, and I was really happy to see him get Best Actor for this movie, he's brilliant and very freakish-like. Jodie Foster, also a huge congrats on the Best Actor win at the Oscars, brilliant job by her.Here's the story there's a maniac out there by the name of ""Buffalo Bill"" and the FBI sends trainee Clarice Starling (Foster) to interview a psychiatrist named Dr. Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lector (Hopkins). Lector agrees to give Clarice hints about how the Feds will catch ""Bill"" if she tells him stories about her own troubled past.It's an amazing film, the thing that makes this movie different from a lot of other horror films is....this movie barely has any blood or gore. I gave this movie a 10 out of 10 because the acting is brilliant, the characters memorable and the story unforgettable. Wonderful movie recommended to anybody that loves watching horror movies!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Terrifying Journey Into The Heart Of Darkness,"An ominous story with interesting and scary characters.Anthony Hopkins is fascinating in the role of Dr. Hannibal Lecter, definitely an impressive acting performance. The characters are interesting and layered, and the depiction of cause and effect is really interesting, I don't think they would be able to do something like that today.It is interesting that here Hannibal Lecter as a serial killer and one of the villains is really scary precisely because he is unusual, intelligent and easily manipulates people. A great film in which Anthony Hopkins showed that he possesses a talent that few actors have.Buffalo Bill, brilliantly played by Ted Levine, is equally terrifying, but in a different way, a violent psychopath who brutally disfigures his victims.Jodie Foster is excellent as Clarice Starling, an interesting and realistic role. The direction is excellent, full of subtle details, and the cinematography is great. Brilliant acting, tense atmosphere and psychological horror.The depiction of mental illness itself is fascinating, and the actors really went out of their way to portray these characters.

The stuff that nightmares are made of.,"A film that still holds my attention. I watched this cannibal thriller when I was quite young, fortunate enough to watch it in theatres and boy was that one hell-of-a ride. The Silence of the Lambs is indeed, the stuff that nightmares are made of. Thrilling, thought provoking, well-acted, and a master piece from Director Jonathan Demme.Hannibal, I think it's still the number.1 villain of all time. He's slick, yet scary, intelligent to the point that you can't stop talking to him, but pure evil in that he will eat your brains out while smiling at you. I don't think anyone by Anthony Hopkins could have pulled this off. Maybe Mads - but he's great for the new age Hannibal. Anthony has a nuisance that could only be harvest by an actor of his calibre. Matched with the fantastic Jodie Foster - she is an incredible actress and together they breathed life into this film.And let's not forget Buffalo Bill - it puts the lotion in the basket

I have seen many thrillers and I can honestly say that this one is not even in my Top 20. Although I think Hopkins did a terrific job in Lecter's shoes, his 30 minutes on screen just were not enough. This was supposed to be a horror film but I think it barely managed to create the suspense atmosphere and it certainly did not scare me or made me feel uncomfortable at all. Perhaps I expected more since I have been hearing all the fuzz about this movie since I was a little kid.

Silence of the Lambs is an excellent in the thriller genre.,"Silence of Lambs is a crime thriller produced in 1991 by director Jonathan Demme. The screenplay was written by Ted Tally, taken from the novel written by Thomas Harris. Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling, is an FBI cadet who is assigned to interview the psychopathic serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lecter played by Anthony Hopkins. Starling gains the confidence of Lecter, a former psychiatrist turned killer/cannibal, in order to obtain information which may lead them to a serial killer tagged by authorities as ""Buffalo Bill,"" who is killing and skinning women. During the interviews Lecter psychoanalyzes Starling and in turn, he states as ""quid pro quo,"" offers clues which lead her to Buffalo Bill.The theme of this film focuses on plot; good guy trying to catch bad guy. Within this basic theme is an underlying theme of change. This theme is characterized by motifs, or patterns that are repeated. Symbols of metamorphosis are present throughout the story. The killer is trying to turn himself into a woman by sewing together pieces of the women's skins. He places a cocoon, the embodiment of change, in their mouths when disposing of the bodies. When Starling kills ""Bill,"" played by Ted Levine, a twirling picture displays a butterfly that appears to fly as it twirls.Silence of the Lambs has a similar theme to the crime thriller film Se7en, produced in 1995 by director David Fincher. The theme of Se7en also focuses on plot: good guys after bad with an emphasis on human depravity which is symbolized by each murder. Victims are chosen by the sins they commit. Both films delve into the psychological profiles of both the killers and the detectives.The use of color, particularly red, in the film foreshadows dramatic scenes that are relevant to the theme. The first time Starling goes in to see Lecter the lighting at the basement entrance is red and directed from the side giving a sense of foreboding. The room in which Bill performs his sewing contains lots of red objects. When Lecter is on the ambulance gurney (everyone believes it is the police chief), the strap across him is red. When Mr. Crawford, Starling's boss (played by Scott Glenn) is on the plane to Chicago, the lighting in the plane is red; as well as the van when the police stage a delivery.Sound is also used in this film to help in building suspense and highlight theme. The most dramatic use of sound in this film was the doorbell scene. The police are raiding the house in Illinois and ring the doorbell. The buzzer goes off in the basement at Bill's house. At the same time Starling is ringing the doorbell at Bill's door. At first, you are not sure which house Bill is in.The relationship between Starling and Lector is a driving force for the story. The use of color, sound, and motifs emphasizes and builds on the theme, which in turn creates the dramatic and suspenseful effects used in developing the plot of Silence of the Lambs.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Crisp and brilliant,"The Silence of the Lambs (1991) reigns supreme as one of the greatest thriller movies of all time. Jonathan Demme reaches cinematic perfection by combining writing, direction and acting of the highest calibre together to form a classic that blows the usual mediocre thriller out of the water. The film tells the story of young FBI Agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) and her quest to help find the serial killer Buffalo Bill. To find Buffalo Bill, Starling requires the help of Dr Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a brilliant psychiatrist who is imprisoned for his cannibalistic behaviour.The Silence of the Lambs is excellent in all aspects of production and form. The dialogue is crisp, poignant and always essential, resulting in a film that is pulse-racing and highly absorbing. The presence of pretentious or stilted dialogue is negated early on in the movie, Clarice referring to a contrived reference as ""too hokey for Lecter"". Never a dull moment, the Silence of the Lambs is masterfully suspenseful as Hannibal Lecter is always one step ahead; his omnipotence, humour and theatrics providing the audience with a villain that is as charming and likable as he is perturbing. The performances are incredible; Hopkins unforgettable as the cannibalistic Lecter, while Foster is compelling as Clarice Starling, playing the young FBI Agent with understated confidence and assertion. Clarice is created as a feminist character with incredible subtlety; she remains unfazed by the advances and gazes of on looking men throughout the film, focused solely on prevailing in her male dominated field of work and uncovering justice. The chemistry between both of the actors is undeniable, Clarice's freshness and subtlety boding well with Hannibal's abrasive and supercilious behaviour.Twenty years on, time does not appear to have worn upon the Silence of the Lambs, Demme's masterpiece still considered as one of the greatest psychological thrillers of all time. With strong performances, an intense score and a no-nonsense script, The Silence of the Lambs elucidates the seemingly forgotten art of story telling to create a film that is captivating from start to finish, and chillingly lingers in the mind long after it has been viewed.This superb film rates a 10/10 from me. I do wish I could review longer, but I'm having an old friend for dinner...",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Most outstanding!,"Few Hollywood films have managed to actually scare me. This one did, so it deserves my applause. It didn't scare me because suddenly, some monster with a knife pops out of nowhere. It scared me because of the dark, creepy premise the film is based on - an insight into the minds of psychopaths - and faithfully follows from beginning to end.The images of the victims do make you shiver, and as you find out more and more about Buffalo Bill's behavior and killing methods, and Dr. Lecter's craving for human flesh, you shiver when you think that there very well could be people like that on the loose.The acting - incredible. Jodie Foster couldn't have played Clarice Starling better. Clarice, alone and vulnerable, yet so strong and smart. Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter - wow! When you hear Hannibal speak, you can't help but think what a smart man he is and how amazing he is, and yet remember the man could be the physical manifestation of evil itself. A very good mix.And when it's all over, you're left shaking and thinking about the serial killers of the world...This is one of my all-time favorite movies, and if you haven't seen it, pick it up - A thrilling, disturbing look into the mind of serial killers that will leave you stirred no matter how jaded you are, and will leave you in awe of the team's great job.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

I remember that everyone in the whole world thought that the killer was the best ever but he was rubbish and not scary. He even gets caught before the film starts! LOL. How rubbish is that? I think it would have been better if he hadn't been in that prison for all that time and had got out and been killing people at the start. And also if they ditched the other killer because he distracts attention and looks weird..The film is all about two serial killers being chased by a woman FBI woman and how she brings them to justice, but that idea falls apart under its own brevity because one of the killers is caught! That takes away 50% of the tension. The director did a very bad job and almost all of the camera movements are lame.At times during it felt like rubbing mustard on my eyelids. and possibly more bad than that!",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Making movies from stories they don't understand,"It seems to be a favorite hobby for some Christian-minded thinkers with superficial world view to take on books and stories that are written from and only understandable from a specifically non-Christian and anti-psychiatric almost satanic frame of mind.It's as if a Priest pretended to be interested and infatuated with the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche and made a documentary of his philosophy attempting to manifest the nature of good and evil within the philosophy of a philosopher that is famous for tearing down the very idea of good and evil.The main idea in the Hannibal books is supposed to center on the depth of their own human nature that the detectives are forced to face when they confront Hannibal. How justice itself revolves around the concept of murder just like being an adult involves the symbolical need to murder ones parents. (Symbolical murder of the idea of parents is needed for the idea of parents as actual separate people, other adults.) One cannot have a view on justice without a willingness for a symbolical murder of injustice.Where in Clarice Starling do we see this soul of a murderer that is supposed to be depicted in this story? Nowhere. Because the story of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is not included in this movie. If you want the story read the book or watch the older movie ""manhunter"" to catch a similar spirited story made as a movie. If you want to read the bible, read the bible instead of watching a bible-fied version of ""The Silence of the Lambs""...",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Chilling psychological thriller.,"The Silence of the Lambs picks up 5 years after the events of Manhunter. A serial killer is kidnapping and murdering women, and wearing their skin as clothing. When the governor's daughter is kidnapped, an FBI trainee named Clarice Starling is sent to talk to the cannibalistic Dr. Hannibal Lecter so he might shed some of his vast knowledge on the case. This leads to a bizarre relationship where Clarice opens up to Hannibal for information. This is a very good psychological thriller that will live on through the years as a timeless classic.The Silence of the Lambs is superior to it's predecessor because it seems to be made on a larger budget, and it uses some big names. It successfully translates the mood from Thomas Harris' novel to film, so the movie comes off as dark and creepy. The characters are awesome. The cat and mouse conversations between Hannibal and Clarice are immensely interesting. She is shy, and Hannibal forces her to be bold. The serial killer in this movie, Buffalo Bill, is based off of real life killer Ed Gein, and he is extremely disturbing in this movie. Another good thing is that this is a no holds barred movie. It doesn't pull any punches. It shows what it wants, and it makes the movie more realistic.The acting is awesome. Anthony Hopkins does a vastly superior job in the role of Hannibal Lecter than Brian Cox did in Manhunter. He made the character his own, and that's why nobody mentions Brian Cox in the role. Hopkins' portrayal is creepy and memorable. Jodie Foster does a knock out job as Clarice Starling, the shy FBI agent forced to interview Hannibal.Overall, this is an amazing movie, and it definitely deserved the Best Picture Oscar. Anybody that loves a good psychological police drama really needs to rent/buy this movie.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Each time I watch it again, it never fails to get me psyched","Jodie Foster, who played Clarice Starling, a young FBI agent chasing a vicious serial killer, reaches out to Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a noted cannibal and master of psychological manipulation, who is even more dangerous than the killer she's hunting.Clarice Starling had the most significant role in the movie, with the majority of screen time. The way she displayed her excitement, nervousness, and fear always sets you up for the alarming vibes before Dr. Lecter's breakout, and before he deploys his psychological tricks right before your eyes. Not only did she display fear, but she also showed vigilance in front of the nefarious cannibal and followed it with extreme courage when confronting the sick serial killer.Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins), although his scenes in the movie didn't exceed 16 minutes, performed one of the best performances on screen, with well-deserved awards. From the second he appears on the screen, you know you're about to see something out of this world. He seems to enjoy manipulating people and taunting Clarice while she tries her best to get something out of him. Lecter's chilling calmness, intellectual prowess, and dark charisma make him a mesmerizing antagonist. His ability to dissect people's minds and exploit their fears is both terrifying and fascinating, making him one of the most iconic characters in cinematic history.The main plot revolves around the hunt for ""Buffalo Bill,"" a grotesque serial killer who skins his female victims. His horrifying acts create a sense of urgency and dread throughout the film. The portrayal of Buffalo Bill adds another layer of terror, as his psychological instability and gruesome methods are profoundly disturbing. The interactions between Clarice and Lecter provide critical insights that ultimately lead her to Buffalo Bill, culminating in a tense and thrilling showdown.""The Silence of the Lambs"" masterfully intertwines these character arcs with a gripping narrative. The film's exploration of fear, manipulation, and the human psyche keeps the audience on edge from start to finish. The meticulous storytelling and outstanding performances by Foster and Hopkins make it a timeless classic. The chilling atmosphere, combined with the deep psychological themes, ensures that the movie leaves a lasting impact, making it a must-watch for anyone with a penchant for thrillers.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Nothing Short of Spectacular,"Silence of the Lambs is a modern day classic. That is all anyone can say about it. From the day it hit theaters, this was the movie that defined the psycho-serial killer drama. Even more, though, the movie is able to escape the horror genre and explore other themes, which is perhaps the main reason it has garnered as many accolades as it has. In recent cinema, I cannot recall another movie that had won the top five awards at the Oscars (Picture, Director, Screenplay, Actor, and Actress) and all deserved for that matter.The movie still keeps me on the edge of my seat every time I watch it, and believe me, I've watched it numerous times. The best part about it is that I find new things to marvel over every time I watch it and the special features on the DVD version enlighten me to even more exciting new things. This was the role of a lifetime for Jodie Foster. In fact, Foster's portrayal of Starling was a pivotal part of the movie. Her humility and vulnerability contrasting with her strong convictions and go-get-em attitude created the perfectly believable character. Her role as a young FBI agent separated from her male counterparts opens the door for gender analysis as well. Furthermore, the chemistry between Hopkins and Foster was so strong that it created the `Beauty and the Beast' relationship originally intended by author Thomas Harris.It's hard to pinpoint exactly what is so remarkable about Demme's film, other than that it's just a good movie.

Amazing.,"As the years go by, movies become more and more predictable. Great thriller movies slowly but surely become harder to find; the plot is bland, the timeline doesn't add up, the acting isn't on point, etc. However, a classic of the American psychological horror genre never fails to keep us on the edge of our seats. Silence of the lambs is a movie that, unlike some recent horror films, manages to keep a strong plot, well-developed characters and great acting throughout the entire movie.The plot remains strong through the entire 118 minutes of the film with a steady storyline even when this one might seem to sidetrack. Despite the movie often portraying the back-and-forth between Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter, never does it forget the main plot. Even within those deep conversations about Starling's childhood, the movie brilliantly links it to the plot and its true villain. All questions are answered and there is no hole in the plot. When all seems over and the story comes to an end, the movie does a great job at making the audience feel one last thrill, one last intrigue, it makes the viewer wonder what will happen next, and that, even hours after finishing the movie.On a different note, the character of Hannibal Lecter, played by Anthony Hopkins, manages to allure viewers for years with as little as 16 minutes of screen time. Lecter's passivity and high intellect are what have both captivated and terrified the audience for ages by constantly dissecting one's personality and putting them at his mercy. Lecter is a character that is both ruthless and unpredictable, he only ever does as he wishes with little to no regard for the consequences, even the death of a patient: ''Who can say. Best thing for him, really. His therapy was going nowhere''. The character always sticks to his morals instead of having a redemption arc, never did they change his character for him to become a lovable guy, and that's what makes him such a great psychological horror character. In only 16 minutes, Anthony Hopkins managed to create one of the most iconic characters in the psychological horror genre.In the end, Silence of the lambs remains an outstanding horror movie even after 31 years. The plot is strong and steady throughout the entire time and the characters are wonderfully portrayed by talented actors, making the entire movie an inevitable classic in the American psychological horror genre.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I Know I'm Probably In The Minority,"I have often considered this movie (and the performances of Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster) to be over rated. I didn't like it upon release, and I found myself bored when I revisited it several years later.However I recently got in to a debate with a friend when I said Robin Williams should have won the Oscar for ""Fisher King"", and either Susan Surrandon or Geena Davis should have won for ""Thelma & Louise"" over Hopkins and Foster in this movie, and he disagreed strongly suggesting I Rewatch this asap. So here we go.Plot in A Paragraph: Clarice Starling (Foster) a young U.S. FBI trainee, seeks the advice of the imprisoned Dr. Lecter (Hopkins) to apprehend another serial killer, known only as ""Buffalo Bill"".Don't get me wrong, both Hopkins and Foster are very good here, I just find the movie routine and their performances over rated. They do have really good chemistry, but only share four scenes throughout the course of the film, with Hopkins only appearing in about 20-25 minutes of the movie.Scott Glenn and Charles Napier give solid support in smaller roles.""Silence Of The Lambs"" was only the third film, the other two being It Happened One Night and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, to win Academy Awards in all the top five categories: Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, and Adapted Screenplay.

Too pedestrian,"I saw this movie when new, and liked it plenty.  That was years ago, and I've grown considerably.  My interest in Thomas Harris' ""Red Dragon"", and the screenplay I'm working on based on it, prodded me into renting SOTL for repeat viewing. I've always held the Oscars in low regard, but have dropped that regard all together after viewing this nonsense.  The 1,000 word maximum on these posts prevents me from mentioning all the folly I found in the film.  But I'll try....Acting:  In most instances, overwrought.  Hopkins was a good psycho, but a bad Lecter.  The Lecter of the novels was far more sedate in his demeanor, prefering to ""charm"" his opposition, allowing himself access to their psyche.  Sniffing the air for skin cream is highly dubious.  Foster did a good job as a young recruit.  The problem I have with her is has more to do with the story.  Seems a bit too unrealistic.  Will Graham convinced me.  Clarice Starling didn't.  Dr. Chilton was played as a complete idiot.  Typical Hollywood bad good-guy.  Made the viewer biased for Lecter.  WRITER SHORTCUT!  I recognize this as a substitute for compelling writing and acting.  Simply bias the audience toward the main character by surrounding him with easy-to-dis-like characters.  No childish brat like the Chilton portrayed would ever hold a job of such responsibility.   Ted Levine was terrific throughout.  Voice, appearance, contortions, crotch, :  all wonderful.  Most of the supporting players were of TV movie quality. Canned dialog, playing dumb for an assumed dumb audience.  Posh on that, Director. As for direction, too many flubs and gimmicks to mention here.  I'll mention one:  The cat in the window growling as Buffalo Bill drives away with Fat Girl # Whatever. Like any cat is going to react in that fashion.  A cat would not bat a whisker if in the presence of such drama.  Would only move if the master was going to land on it.  Otherwise, no fur ruffled.  What a gimmick that was.The music was typical of Hollywood reality.  Never in my life, when confronted with drama of any intensity, have I heard violins out of nowhere. DIRECTOR SHORTCUT!:  Adding sappy ""music"" to enhance mood.  In most cases, this is to bolster or cover any weaknesses in writing, acting, direction, or all three.  (NOTE: This is certainly not exclusive to this film.  Most Hollywood productions employ this tactic.) The ending of the film was almost good about this.  No music, just Foster in the dark.  ***NO SPOILER***  But the ending could've been better.  Easily.MANHUNTER should have won 15 Oscars, if SOTL could win 5. Sure, it was a bit too 80's in appearance, but far more accurate and convincing.  Better book, too.In summation, too dumbed down.  Booooooo.",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

the suspense of the silence,"after hearing about this movie a lot from my friends, i finally managed to see this film and although i wouldn't say it blew me off but even then it was a great movie-watching experience.every great movie has its 1 strong point that separates it from the others and make that film stand out. it could be the story, the script, the cinematography etc. but for this movie without a doubt it was the acting performances of its lead actors. through 'hannibal lecter', anthony hopkins creates a character that is unforgettable. scott glenn and jodie foster also put in strong performances.the script of the story is based on a book which i haven't read but whenever this sort of a thing happens, you find the script lacking and this happens here too. although you may not feel this but at some points you feel that a little bit more insight could've been useful. one particular situation is easily predictable(may be i have seen it in many movies after that).the cinematography and background score are very good as you expect with any technically good movie. the use of close range shots to showcase lecter is very well done.the direction of this movie is very good with attention played to every bit of detail and sailing the movie off smoothly. a few scenes are absolutely chilling and leave you star-struck with their way of depiction.also i have to say that it is one of the most clever titles that i have heard.in the end i just want to say that this movie is a one that shouldn't be missed for a great performance by anthony hopkins.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"For once, the Academy wasn't entirely inaccurate!","When most novels-- the ones worth reading, at least-- are converted into films, the results are, in most instances, vastly inferior; on rare occasions, the movie adaptations equal or even surpass the creative impact of their written forms._The Silence of the Lambs_ is one such film. Though it is quite different from Thomas Harris' widely revered novel-- and I will refrain from elaborating upon these differences because everyone should, at some point, sit down and read Harris' finest work-- the film is no less an artistic triumph.The strength of _The Silence of the Lambs_ is in the tense interplay between Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling and Sir Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lechter. The rapport between their characters is both riveting and bone-chilling in its intensity, and the thought of lesser actors tackling such scenes is perhaps as frightening as any of this masterful film's horror. Their performances are the driving force behind the film.Jonathan Demme's direction is also first-rate. Though the score is occasionally too obvious and overpowering, his decisions-- from sweeping camera pans to tightly framed close-ups-- are generally wise, and they give the film the uncomfortable atmosphere needed to create the dramatic tension that sustains the viewer's interest through to the movie's unsettling climactic scenes.Easily one of the best films of the 1990s, a decade characterized by extravagance, _The Silence of the Lambs_ is sufficiently daring, while managing a certain restraint within all of its elements-- the intelligently-composed screenplay, Demme's direction, and the ensemble acting-- that allows it to transcend to an artistic level far above most every other film of the past ten years.RATING: 10 out of 10. It's not entirely perfect, but _The Silence of the Lambs_, with its unrivaled intensity and passion, epitomizes the psychological thriller genre. A decade from now, it will be considered a ""canonical"" film with the likes of _Citizen Kane_ and _To Kill a Mockingbird_.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Stupendous Thriller!,"Probably the most gripping thriller I have seen, with lots of delightful touches. Jodie Foster gives arguably her best screen performance, and Anthony Hopkins is brilliant (as nearly always!). The plot is beautifully worked, with a great climax. But, there is a lot more beneath the surface, which brings this film from merely a good thriller to a great film.

"Smart thriller, beautifully character driven","Clarice Starling (Foster) interviews cannibal Dr Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins) in an attempt to track down serial killer Buffalo Bill.No amount of praise that comes into this world will be enough to recognize the brilliance of this picture. Intelligent, quick witted, psychotic, different, shocking, tense and beautifully acted, the list of positives simply continues.The most recognized feature of this film is more than likely Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of the evil Hannibal Lecter. An extremely intelligent man who simply knows everything, he IS the epitome of evil.His smart sophistication and intelligence is brought to the screen in a vivid and shocking manor when dealing with FBI trainee Clarice Starling. The pairing of Jodie Foster (The Accused) and Hopkins (World's fastest Indian) is a thing of art. With Clarice's entry into the crime world and Hannibal's experience, we see a wonderful reflection of life. The past, the present and the future all intellectually driven by Lecter. Ideologies of investigation, nightmares and diagnosis's are all brought to the screen in a shocking manor, brought to an astounding light and credit to the actors who both received Oscars for their acts. Though Hannibal has hardly any screen time he is the stand out figure of the picture and will leave a devastating effect in the viewer's mind that will never be erased.Based on Thomas Harris' novel, this tells the story of Clarice, coming into the FBI world, unaware of anything and still haunted by her past.Unlike many crime films out there, this 1991 Oscar winning picture is beautiful in crafting character but also delivering a knockout issue driven plot, combining the two most important elements of films. This is achieved through some intelligent portrayals, but a grasping realistic direction tactic by Jonathan Demme.The plot is consistent with the dramatic ideology of the serial killer driving the film forward. There are a couple of scenes that are questionable, and a second viewing is usually necessary to capture all the necessary information.Having never read the book myself, I find this to be a shocking tale that the book may either offer so much more, or put a dent on the picture. Either way, the film is a necessity for any film fanatic.Smart and sophisticated, Silence of the Lambs is fast and flowing, beautifully realistic with a great line of characters, and one of the greatest on screen villains in history.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Decent thrillers but too gory,"Decent thrillers but too gory. Demme's direction is remarkable throughout the picture. Watch how he milks every scene, every sequence hyped or taken to incredibly dramatic lengths. Foster's visit to Hannibal Lecter (a cannibal who lives in a maximum security prison), for example, takes us down endless flights of stairs, each level heralded by ominous dialogue, a prison warden even pausing to show Foster a photograph of Lecter's mutilated victims. But importantly, while characters in the film flinch in horror at the image on this photograph, the photograph itself is never actually revealed to Demme's audience. This happens throughout the film: horrors are talked about, emphasised, hyped, our appetite whetted at every turn, but never actually revealed. Here is a film which respects our imagination and treats the macabre with a certain amount of apprehension. Even the film's ending, in which an escaped Hannibal Lectre walks confidently off into the horizon, is the kind of dramatic tease-climax more common in super hero movies. Whilst most horror movies are a series of carefully set up orgasms, ""Silence"" is all anticipation.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Worst actress of all time....,The book is completely boring. The movie is more interesting. Jodie Foster is the worst actress I ever seen. Obviously she never had any lessons. She can't act and more worse she doesn't open her mouth while she speaks - a disaster without compare. People like Jodie Foster would fail ANY real test for actors. But in Hollywood even the worst actors can earn millions of dollars with technically extreme bad acting. A real joke to pair the technically worst speaking actress with one of the technically best speaking actors (Anthony Hopkins) in a movie where the book is even more boring than the movie. The plot is just like the book illogical IN ANY SENSE.,1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Frankly, I was disappointed to learn that there would be a sequel, as I think this film, and its story, stand so well on their own and need no elaboration.

brilliant!! great minds think alike! be ready to enter world of two human monsters.,"A brilliant dark thriller. It shows how evil and dark the human mind can get. Out of all the 5 awards it won Mr.Hopkins deserves it the most, who better to play an evil psychotic genius then him.When Lector talks to her at his cell in museum with camera up close to his face that must be seen in the theater. Some may not reallies that Stariling is also a innocent pretty sparrow, and that Clarcie Starling is the same. We see Lecter as the deadly monster, in two scene's's when Chiltion explains the physical safety measures taken when visiting Lecter. When Crawford quotes""just do your job Clarcie, and never forget what he is."" We also see Lector walk along his cell at the museum following Clarcie as she is being haled away, he walks as if he were a tiger pacing in the cage. The moth was especially nice touch, because on the movie cover on DVD and VHS the moths head has seven naked women that create the moth's creepy skull. The women represent ""Buffalo Bills"" six victims and Kathren the seventh whom he abducts. When Starling dream of her trying to save a lamb its like way she is trying to save Kathren. The movie title is very unique for a dark creepy film. if you don't have a clue about the film and only heard the title you would wonder what kind of movie it is. would horror,dark, thriller come to mind.

Gnaw its way to the Mind Terror,"""Silence of the lambs"" is one of the masterpieces of the last decade. And does it have its reasons. First of all, it's entirely dependant on the terror that gnaws all the way to the mind of the viewer. The decline of the Human Being is magnificently chiseled with one liners that amusingly depict the killers and psychopaths state of mind and approach us carefully into a nature that is deformed, evil and sick of the Man's putrefaction.The main spectacle is drawn between Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins. Both entirely relevant to the movie, they produce a bright contrast and with their performances they nail the feelings right and expose one of the best duels on movie history. This duel, although, is not conventional. Clarice Starling (Foster) will use Hannibal Lecter's (Hopkins) profound knowledge of the criminal mind to capture the infamous Buffalo Bill. But Hopkins will play a game in which their personalities will engage in a retroactive combination, in a ""quid pro quo"" mind spar: she will have to expose her most profound, hidden secrets to Lecter, so he can also dispatch on his pleasure of analyzing the suffering of others. Both of them reveal all of their character's whole personality with their eyes: Foster is in constant pressure, scared but facing the natural Hades with courage and Hopkins shows human emptiness in his eyes, windows to what is a world full of depravations.Ted Levine is truly scary. You get the impression that he is the true Buffalo Bill, twisted and perverse. He shows absolutely no human, recognizable aspect. He is a terrible villain.The movie will straightly envelop you in an obscure labyrinth where the human mind is retorted and rotten, with a depressing score and settings that are grey, murky and never joyful.

There is a remarkable buildup of suspense, particularly at one point towards the end that made my heart race.Perhaps the most amazing accomplishment is that every technical aspect managed to not stick out in an overt way.

One of the best murder mystery thrillers you will ever see,"I first saw Silence when it came out in late 1991. A friend and I saw it, and left the theater stunned. It was the first time I have ever had trouble sleeping after watching a movie, so impactful was the content.Silence is flawless in all aspects. Casting, screenplay/plot, direction, cinematography, and editing are superb. By now, we are all familiar with Dr Lector (Anthony Hopkins), the deranged, brilliant psychologist who does battle with the forces of good, here represented by the FBI's Clarice Starling (Jody Foster. Perhaps her last great role). Hopkin's performance is a tour de force of acting. He uses words like knives to stab at Clarice, exposing her checkered past, extracting information that he stores to dig into her later on. And Clarice, a young FBI agent with strong experience in psychology, is clearly overmatched by Dr Lector. They play a back and forth cat and mouse game that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout.Excellent casting includes the sanitarium head, Dr Chilton (Anthony Heald) who plays this sleazy Head who covets having Dr Lector as his prize while clumsily trying to snag a date with Clarice. Scott Glenn portrays Dr Crawford, Clarice's boss whom she looks up to. He has his own demons he's dealing with that are never fully revealed, and the father-mentor interaction between him and Clarice is palpable. Finally, there's the other evil force, excellently played by Ted Levine.There is a significant amount of killing, and some very viscerally evil scenes that are not for the squeamish. You will be moved, so if you are not good with strong physical scenes, you may want to close your eyes a lot. But you must see this film. The final piece is the editing and directing, which weaves every scene together so it all adds up and makes sense at the end, kind of like in Forest Gump, but with evil intent, not kindness.This film was one of those rare gems that even the Oscars got right by awarding it the triple crown of Oscars - Best picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Actress. It also won best screenplay. If you have not seen this movie, it's a must-see that you should put on your list.

You can't help that there is a monster just waiting to appear from Hopkins. I just couldn't help laughing with amazement. However, one of the biggest breakthroughs of the movie is probably Ted Levine as Jame Gumb (Buffalo Bill), playing the main psychotic serial killer. He has a way of playing the part that you is so mad that it is excellent.Despite this, I don't really understand or believe the stories of people fainting in the cinema at the film's release in 1991.

One of my Top Twenty Ever Movies!,"Over 20 years after I first saw this film I have now decided to put 'pen to paper' so to speak and praise what I think is one of the most gripping murder movies made, with a host of actors from Jodie Foster, Scott Glenn,Anthony Heald, Ted Levine - who was a relative newcomer then - and of course Anthony Hopkins firmly at the top of their game. Everyone knows the story by now of how Clarice Starling(Foster) has not yet passed-out of the FBIs famous academy at Quantico when and where she is under the close supervision of one of its chiefs Jack Crawford(Glenn)and they are on the hunt for a serial-killer 'Buffalo Bill'. They or perhaps SHE seeks the assistance of Dr.Hannibal Lekter, a brilliant but disturbed criminal killer himself and she has intimate talks with him in his cell to garner information she hopes will help find 'Bill' before he kills more innocent young women in his most deranged and brutal way mutilating them. The only criticism I saw throughout the film was the plausibility of the situation Foster finds herself in towards the very end and whether that would be possible? I don't know - I 'm NOT in the FBI and having read the 'Trivia' I think this has been explained.

The perfect psychological thriller,"'The Silence of the Lambs'. This movie literally made cinema's history in the evening of March, 30th, 1992. It was Oscar's night, and Jonathan Demme's thriller went home with all the five major awards - Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role, Best Actress in a Leading Role, Best Director and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, becoming only the third movie is history to ever achieve this accomplishment (the other ones are 1934 Frank Capra's 'It Happened One Night' and 1975 Milos Forman's 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'). And the Academy was perfectly right, as 'The Silence of the Lambs' is easily the best movie of 1991 and one of the best thrillers of all-time. It deserved all the awards it got.'The Silence of the Lambs' is based on one of Thomas Harris' novels about serial-killer Hannibal Lecter. But Lecter only appears in the movie within 13 minutes of runtime. Before that, we are presented to the movie's major plot, that is centered around Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster). Clarice is a young FBI agent that is assigned to the case of Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), a serial killer that skins his victims and then throws them in a river. But in order to gather information for the case, Clarice must talk to Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), the most feared and dangerous serial killer in the world. The story here doesn't have a lot of originality, but the way the movie explains it to the audience is simply amazing. The character development is incredible, the dialogs are outstanding and the montages are breath-taking. I couldn't blink not even for one second, which proves how good the writing is. The first of the five major Oscars was certainly very well-deserved. Thumbs up for Thomas Harris for the novel and for Ted Tally for the excellent adaptation.Now, let's talk about the acting, and there is only one thing to say about it: it couldn't be any better. The whole supporting cast is outstanding, with the exception of Brooke Smith, as one of Buffalo Bill's victims. She was just average, nothing special to it. But the member of the supporting cast that stands out is certainly Ted Levine. He should have been at least Oscar-nominated for his performance as Buffalo Bill, a quite creepy interpretation. Aside from the supporting cast, also composed by Scott Glenn and Anthony Heald, all the attention here goes for the two leading roles. Both Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins are perfect, specially Hopkins. Even though he has only 27 minutes of screen-time, Hopkins managed to deliver one of the most memorable performances of the 1990's decade. All his gestures, that creepy coolness, the tones his voice reaches... it's all perfect for the character. None other actor could have done a better job, another very well-deserved Oscar. The other leading role here goes to Jodie Foster. Of course she is not as great as Anthony Hopkins, but she also delivers a very memorable performance. Her naiveness, the hidden South accent, her desperate struggle to impress her superiors - Clarice Starling and Jodie Foster are only one. Again, a deserved Oscar award - this time for Best Actress.The fourth Oscar award this movie received was Best Director for Jonathan Demme. And the guy really impresses you on his directing work. The movie wouldn't be the same nor it would have the same recognition if it wasn't for him. The places Demme puts the camera are excellent, as he did it for the audience to feel in the skin of Clarice Starling. And in order to do this, Demme makes all the characters look straight into the camera, except for Clarice, that never does this, always looking at another direction. There are also a few scenes (most tracking-shots) designed to be like the the eyes of Clarice. And her childhood memories only increases the audience's approach to Jodie Foster's character. Another deserved Oscar-award.The movie was also Oscar-nominated for Best Sound and Best Editing. The Sound here is nothing out of the ordinary, with nice Sound Effects, but a lousy musical score. Nothing that takes away the movie's accomplishments, tough. As for Best Editing, it should have got the award. Craig McKay's editing work is outstanding, as the audience is fooled to believe in things that turn out to be others. I'm not gonna spoil it here, but you are gonna feel pretty dumb once you find out the tricks McKay used. The cinematography here is also nothing out of the ordinary, such as the other aspects. Nothing that's worth mentioning.Overral, 'The Silence of the Lambs' is the perfect psychological thriller. The fact it won all the five major awards at the Oscars only proves my point, and they were all extremely well-deserved. The writing is amazing, the acting is perfect, and the directing is outstanding. You put that with one of the most memorable performances of the decade by Anthony Hopkins, join with a great editing work, ferocious dialogs and an impressive directing, and you have the best movie of 1991. From all the five major awards, the last one was the most well-deserved: Best Picture.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Stunning and unforgettable cinema,"Now over twenty years old, Silence of the Lambs is still one of the most intriguing films ever made. Ambitiously blurring the lines between the genres of horror, psychological thriller and crime drama, Silence is intense but not overpowering, and complex without ever losing sight of its grand narrative.As with all great films, many components come together to create a masterpiece; excellent screenplay, directing, cinematography and musical score to name but a few. However for me, the acting is what makes Silence the unforgettable experience that it is. Jodie Foster's portrayal of the young and inexperienced FBI agent instructed to investigate the actions of a serial killer is as flawless as acting can be, inspiring many later performances from actresses in similar roles, and providing the audience with a first person narrative to stabilise some of the more horror-centred segments of the film.Anthony Hopkins' performance as Hannibal Lecter is equally magnificent. Despite appearing in less than a quarter of the film. his combination of intensity, calculated calmness and slow-burning character development without ever truly revealing the character's true history or even motivations, the audience is presented with, in my opinion, one of the greatest psychopath film characters of all time, breaking stereotypes of violent and out-of-control villains and creating something far more terrifying.It is the lack of prolonged scenes of graphic violence, blood and torture that give Silence its edge over almost all other horror films. It is unassuming when watched for the first time, and slowly becomes increasingly fascinating, impossible to watch and not become totally immersed into this world which is, after all, the real purpose of fiction.A timeless classic that will never lose its terrifying yet understated charm or relentless quest to redefine chilling and breathtaking cinema, this is a film that the viewer will dwell on long after the credits roll.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Possibly the best film of the 90's?,"Looking back at the 90's,some of the best films I saw in that era were very dark and sinister films that tapped into our fear factor and while compelling us also terrified us.Silence Of The Lambs and Se7en were both mainstream pictures that held aloft a very bleak vision but managed to garner massive public appeal as well as critical acclaim.Lambs will be best remembered for the scintillating performance provided by Anthony Hopkins but there really is a lot more to it than that.The film is alive with evil,it is a sinister and deeply disturbing film that gets under the skin, quite literally, and keeps the tension wound tight until the final act.Jodie Foster is brilliant as Clarice Starling displaying vulnerability and balls in equal measure, the follow up film should have never been made without her.Director Jonathan Demme didn't go on to make a film anywhere near as compelling as this,sure the film is driven by Hopkins' performance but Demme also gets the best out of Ted Levine and Foster as well managing to maintain the tension to tremendous effect throughout.In summary Silence Of The Lambs is a brilliant book to film adaptation that encapsulates everything that was great about the book and builds upon it. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Excellent performances by Anthony & Jodie!,"In my opinion, THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS has excellent performances by Anthony (Hopkins) and Jodie (Foster). I thought that Clarice (Jodie Foster) looked very pretty in all the dressy clothing she wore, especially the dressy outfits she wore when she visited Dr. Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) in jail. This film didn't scare me at all. Well, maybe just a little. Dr. Lecter scared me a little when he attacked the two cops in his cell. There was only one thing that really grossed me out, and that was the killer (Ted Levine) shoving an insect down each victim's throat and then skinning them. That was really disgusting in my opinion. Also, when I noticed that Buffalo Bill had a pierced nipple, I got really uncomfortable, but I still enjoyed the movie.

Clarice is a vulnerable character that pulls off a believable FBI trainee. You believe she has the strength to do the job but are constantly concerned for her safety. Jodie Foster is as always and incredible actor. The scenes with Foster and Hopkins are undeniably the strength of this movie. Hopkins picks away at Foster's inner demons, forcing her to open up her troubling past. In exchange, he reveals more and more information on the identity of a notorious serial killer. Foster's desperation does nothing to budge Hopkins from his request, and her vulnerability is more and more present as their scenes progress. They are both remarkable in this movie.

WYLION - I'd consume this movie with some fava beans and a nice chianti!,"What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said?Is the movie fantastic?

All three of the performances were brilliant in their own right. The young Jodie Foster, 29, brought to the table a very curious and strong character (Clarice Starling). When you usually hear about the performances in this movie you always hear about Anthony Hopkins and Ted Levine. Due to this when it comes to the movie you would think both of these actors blow the young Foster out of the water but this isn't quite how it turned out. Yes, she was slightly overshadowed by the their performances but not enough to the point where Jodie's performance wasn't noticeable. Also the other twos performances were some of the best performances known to date. While Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of Hannibal, The Cannibal, Lecture stole the show from Ted Levine, again it wasn't by much. Both had their moments of making you feel uneasy and even physically cringe in places. Although only small, the only issue I have with this movie is that all other characters were out shined. This is down to their performances just not being good enough to stand up to the three main characters' as named above.

But ""Silence of the Lambs"" is not merely a thrill show.

An awesome,"I think its so hard for a such stars like Anthony Hopkins and Jodie to produce Crime,Thriller movie at this time..Silence of the Lambs is a heart-racing thriller that has arguably one of the most interesting characters in cinema history, Hannibal Lector, a famous psychologist who also has Antisocial Personality Disorder. Hannibal Lector is played by Anthony Hopkins and at the beginning of the movie, he is approached by a young, rising FBI agent, named Clarice Starling, played by Jodie Foster. Clarice has come to interview Hannibal, because she is currently on the hunt for a serial killer, nicknamed Buffalo Bill, who kidnaps young women and skins them in order to make a ""suit"" made out of human skin. Since he is both a psychiatrist and a ruthless killer himself, Hannibal is the perfect person to ask for help to catch Buffalo Bill, and the rest of the movie is devoted to Hannibal's relationship with Clarice as he helps her catch Buffalo Bill and as he toys with her psychologically.Hannibal Lector only appears on screen for 16 minutes and yet, he has such a commanding presence over the entire movie. Before the viewer even meets Hannibal, we hear that he is manipulative, dangerous, a monster, and a cannibal, and yet, when the viewer finally has the opportunity of meeting him, he appears genuine and even caring. However, it soon become evident that this charming persona is only a disguise used to get what he wants, whether that is his freedom or traumatic memories from Clarice's childhood. He has no trouble tricking people into trusting him, and seems to enjoy that he is able to cleverly manipulate people to get what he wants from them. On top of that, he is rude and makes very offensive remarks towards others without any regard to how offensive his comments are. Again, he seems to enjoy being able to offend people so much with the words. Finally, perhaps the most telling of all is his murderous nature. Hannibal enjoys eating people (cleverly nicknamed Hannibal the Cannibal), and had been arrested for serving his dinner guests the liver from a man who he had killed. In one scene, he is seen brutally attacking two guards, biting off one person's cheek and then savagely beating the other to death, and then after the killing of both guards, he begins to sway peacefully to the classical music that had been playing in the background. It was the exact same persona as he saw him standing in his cell when we first meet him, cool, calm, and collected, thus indicating his complete lack of guilt for the serious crime that he had just committed.As I said above, the movie does an excellent job of creating Hannibal Lector, and his behaviors are consistent and similar to the behaviors of people who have Antisocial Personality Disorder. Like most other people with this psychological disorder, Hannibal shows no remorse for hurting others, especially the people who gets in his way, and he is certainly fine with committing murder. He manipulates people to get what he wants and amuses himself by offending and toying around with others, displaying a common symptom of people with Antisocial Personality Disorder, a disregard for other people's rights.Silence of the Lambs would have been an excellent movie if it only had Anthony Hopkins' performance as Hannibal Lector, but it also has a great performance from Jodie Foster and an unbelievably well shot movie. It is definitely worth watching, and it does a good job with showing how creepy and scary a person with Antisocial Personality Disorder can be.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"excellent performances, great writing","Silence of the Lambs is a psychological thriller that positions its most dangerous (and interesting) character in a prison cell for much of the screen time, so his character can be shown through intuitions, subtext, hindsight narrative and general creepiness.That character is Anthony Hopkins as ""Hannibal Lecter"", a cultured psychiatrist imprisoned among psychiatric criminal scum who longs for decent human contact or escape, except he himself has a history of killing people and eating the mutilated parts.All of this is described off-screen, and the film doesn't indulge in unpleasant gore or cheap shock effects - the films main secondary character is Buffalo Bill, a man who applied for gender reassignment, but Lecter explains he was repeatedly denied on basis of his psychological profile. Due to repeated abusive childhood trauma, has become an anonymous, dysfunctional recluse who randomly assaults and kills women. Lecter suggests that his victimhood narrative contributes to his inhumane treatment of others, he drops other details and secrets about the killer but isn't fully cooperative about providing a complete psychological profile of the killer due to the indignity of his life in prison.Clarise Starling is an FBI rookie, chosen for her attractiveness, to get information from Hannibal Lecter on his former patient and contact Buffalo Bill. The reverse-symbolism of having Dr Lecter behind bars whilst Starling is just beyond them is a brilliant bit of staging, as much of the film's subtext is about the gender coding of behaviour, identity and social roles.Its also genuinely scary, but mostly on the level of dialogue and performance, Silence of the Lambs is rightly considered one of the best films of all time in the drama/thriller/psychological horror category, also the police procedural scenes are taut and realistic, or as realistic as you could expect. A second underlying theme of the piece is that the state ultimately protects its own interests, but is unable in the last instance to truly protect the public from crime.There is a 'happy ending' of sorts in the picture, in that Starling, a lone female FBI agent in a predominantly male service, overcomes a male aggressor mentally and physically. An empowering ending that's more of a relief than an actual closure.Silence of the Lambs is brilliant, but also the hubbub surrounding the films release and its subsequent awards greenlit some terrible sequels where this movie's lead, director and screenwriter didn't even contribute. Some audience members aren't aware but this film bares similarities to the previous Thomas Harris adaptation ""Manhunter"", released as a film in 1986. Later films in the ""series"" are a pointless cash-in on the famous character Anthony Hopkins embodies in this film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Take notes,"Every once in a while, a film is released which revives its dead genre. In the early '90s, for the horror/thriller genre, The Silence of the Lambs was that film. After a tribe of awful horror flicks (e.g. 1988's Child's Play) with recycled story lines like serial killers hunting dumb teens, The Silence of the Lambs took the serial killer movie to a new level.The Silence of the Lambs swept the 1991 Academy Awards, becoming only the third film in history - after 1934's It Happened One Night and 1975's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest - to win all five major categories (Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress and Screenplay), and the first horror movie to win Best Picture. This is a tremendous achievement when it was released more than 12 months before, considering the Academy's notoriously short attention span. Each award was well deserved, with Best Director Jonathan Demme both marvellously pulling off the most gripping scenes and never losing sight of the human element of the picture, Best Actor Anthony Hopkins and Best Actress Jodie Foster both delivering unforgettable performances as the dangerously intelligent cannibal serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lecter and the less-than-perfect but strong willed rookie FBI Agent Clarice Starling, and Ted Tally's Best Adapted Screenplay both delivering snappy, quotable dialogue (""Oh, and Senator, one more thing: LOVE your suit!"") and perfectly tapping into the mind of a serial killer.This is the horror film that they all want to be, but almost all of them won't. I've only ever seen one other that is in quite the same league as this, and that is The Sixth Sense (M. Night Shyamalan must have watched TSOTL about 12 times while making that film). This groundbreaking masterpiece of horror is the standard by which all other horror movies are measured, and it is indeed the film that for which Hopkins, Foster and Demme will all be remembered.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Intense, gruesome and complex but a tad overrated horror/thriller.","The film that began the world famous Hannibal Lector character is a very good one indeed. But I don't think that it lives up to the full quantity of its hype. The two leads deserved the Oscars they won back in 1991 but I don't think that the film deserved any more than that.Nonetheless, the quality of acting from these two leads is outstanding. At 28 she was already an accomplished actress so Jodie Foster perfectly captures the role of hesitantly determined detective Clarice Starling. It's hard to believe that the Hannibal Lector part was offered to so many other actors before Anthony Hopkins was rightfully offered the role. He creates one of the most memorable movie characters of the 20th Century and is brilliant for the part.It's a shame that the same can't be said about the rest of the performances. Ted Levine, one of the most overlooked actors in the past 20 years, never receives any conviction in his role, offers us no motive, and is just plain dull in his part. No background is offered to his character and is much inferior to Ralph Fiennes character in the recently made prequel, `Red Dragon'. Scott Glenn soon gave up `the method' after he proved to be a dud. Apparently, he sat in a room for hours everyday listening to the sounds of killers torturing their victims, so he could prepare for the role. Too bad that what we see on screen is something less professional.One thing that the film does succeed in doing is intensifying scenes so as you don't know what will happen next. It gets gratuitously visceral in some scenes to try and be humane, but just looks gruesome and unattractive. While the story is complex and the film ends so as most people will be satisfied, I didn't see much else of `sheer brilliance' about it.Maybe it's just me or maybe this is a needlessly overrated film. But still, `The Silence of the Lambs' is a very good horror/thriller that well outshines its disastrous sequel `Hannibal'. 7.5/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Put the lotion in the basket!!!!!!!,"Silence of the Lambs is probably the best movie of its kind. Its sheer intensity is unmatched. It is a superbly well-written story that involves multiple very dangerous characters, most notorious of which is Dr. Lecter (Hannibal). An FBI agent, Clarice Starling (wonderfully portrayed by Jodie Foster) needs to extract information from a dangerous psychopath Hannibal Lecter (amazingly brought to life by Anthony Hopkins) about a serial killer called Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine).There are so many elements that make Silence Of The Lambs chillingly scary. Buffalo Bill chooses young female victims and skins them. He kidnaps the daughter of a senator which quickly prompts an FBI hunt. Agent Clarice visits Dr. Lecter who is held in a maximum security prison to ask him questions about Buffalo Bill's psychological profile because he was Dr. Lecter's patient many years ago....when Dr. Lecter was a normal human being (if you can call it that).I have always found the idea of a psychologist going insane and becoming a human eating monster very scary. I mean he is supposed to be the expert about human behavior to cure psychological disturbances and he is the most disturbed of all. However, he is equally brilliant. Dr. Lecter's brilliant mind brings depth to his character. Clarice's difficult task of understanding and deciphering the mind of -not one but- two psychopaths creates multi-dimensions.I don't want to say too much about the story and what happens next. But let me say that the movie is full of suspense and literally breath-taking moments. After 20 years, I have not seen any other similar type of movie that I enjoyed as much as I enjoyed Silence of the Lambs. This movie completely changes the serial killer characters in movies and adds depth to them in an unprecedented fashion. Killers in movies like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Friday the 13th, Halloween (the major horror franchises) gave us faceless monsters with no character depth. They wouldn't say a word or even make a sound (this was probably done to disassociate them from regular human beings). Even though this seemed to have worked, Silence of the Lambs' depiction of killer monsters in more elaborate fashion works even better.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A Modern Horror Masterpiece ...,"If there ever was a movie genre that needed constant renovations in order to maintain its appeal, it's certainly Horror, and at this level, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" didn't just reinvent but transcended it.Fear is based on a simple principle : the 'boo' effect. The less we expect something to happen, the most it scares us. ""Psycho"", by featuring a totally demented boy-next-door villain, terrified an audience used to associate horror with vampires and exotic monsters. ""The Exorcist"" pushed the level of realism to a magnificent artistry while ""Jaws"" suggested a mysterious presence, keeping it even more frightening, a device sublimated by the movies ""Alien"" and ""The Shining"". All these movies shared an iconic significance in the evolution of Thriller and more specifically Horror films and it seemed like nothing could surprise a mature audience anymoreThis situation worsened with the consecration of slasher films and their overused cheap-plotted formulas making uncertain recipes out of classic ingredients, notably those introduced by the previous masterpieces : hemoglobin overdose, gruesome over-the-top special effects and various experimentations that pushed the genre down to Z-movies in the worst case, and in the best, B-movies with a cult status. So, a masterpiece built out of a new and fresh material was begging to be made. And cinematic Gods attributed this mission to Jonathan Demme with the classic ""Silence of the Lambs"", the first Horror film to win the Oscar for Best Picture. Finally.""The Silence of the Lambs"" is one of the greatest cinematic achievements of cinema's history. Every single element contributes to create a disturbing and unique atmosphere, and I use very carefully the word 'unique'. I highly doubt anyone was reminded of a villain with the same caliber as Dr. Hannibal -with the chilling rhyming nickname- Lecter, masterfully personified by Anthony Hopkins. I doubt anyone remembers a similar movie where a young, vulnerable and non-Ellen-Ripley looking girl doesn't play the victim, nor the hero's love interest, but the actual heroine. Clarice Starling, as a FBI trainee is played by Jodie Foster, in a performance subtly combining feminine vulnerability and heroic tenacity. And no one would have expected the film to have a binary structure with a classic serial-killer's investigation in one hand, and a subplot involving one of the greatest movie villains of all-time and his interaction with the heroine, on the other.The script is tightly constructed, patiently leading us to assemble each piece of the puzzle until the series of interactions between Clarice and Hannibal approaches a disturbing truth. The relationship between the two leads is even more fascinating because it deepens their personalities and allows us to get more and more in their background : the wounds in Clarice's past, the mystery around Hannibal Lecter, and the roots of evil that inspired the serial killers' acts. And this is where the freshness of the film relies on : its capability to put everything into perspective and invite our perceptions to go beyond the simple 'good vs. evil' dichotomy. The villain are no sharks, no monsters, no possessing demons, they are everyday men, like some Norman Bates with an extra level of savagery and pervert creativity and we try to understand to better fight them, under the pervert irony that the investigation requires a psychopathic mind to arrest another one.Talking about psychopath, the way Hannibal is introduced after the first minutes is impressive and gloomy enough to make us expect the worst and when we finally see him, standing, well-dressed, clean cut, the impact is immediate. Demme's meticulous direction introduces Clarice in a very clever way too, she's basically a girl enduring a lot of stress and hardship while trying to overcome a physically handicapping feminine condition in a world of men. There's one scene where she enters an elevator, surrounded by a group of men whose big sizes emphasize her tininess. Another moment shows her trying to handle a group of officers standing in a room, assessing a minimum of authority. Clarice Starling is endearing and engaging as the heroine driven by a desire of justice and accomplishment, and the trust or fondness developed by both the Agent in Charge, Crawford, played by Scott Glenn, and maybe Hannibal Lecter, himself. After all, the many close-ups on his face during his interrogations and the suavity of his voice suggest a disturbing feel of intimacy between him and Clarice. And as the investigations progresses, the extraordinary portrayal of the real villain of the film, by an underrated Ted Levine, keeps us hooked until the final confrontation.If you noticed, I mentioned every element that generally makes a great movie, writing, acting, directing, the movie was indeed the third, and last to date, to win the five major Academy Awards, after ""It Happened One Night"" and ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"". It had this classic feeling from the day it was released because it combined so many new elements that defined the notion of psychological thriller, before it became a trend. And it's no surprise that the film topped many list from the American Film Institute, #5 of AFI's 100 Thrills, #6 heroine, and good ol' Hannibal as number one movie villain, and he wasn't even the main antagonist in the film, which says as much as his winning the Oscar for less than 20 minutes on-screen, to find a character with the same cinematic aura, I guess we would go back to Vito Corleone.""The Silence of the Lambs"" reinvented the horror genre as the kind of movie that would have made Alfred Hitchcock proud : a scary villain, a sympathetic hero, a script respecting our intelligence, top-notch direction and editing, and for one thing, it didn't even need a twist ending",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A dynamite Hollywood thriller.,"This is deservedly one of the most popular and praised of all the entries in the worn-out ""cop vs. killer"" genre, and represents a career high point for its key participants. It's especially noteworthy that it should have swept the five major Oscars for the year of its release, considering that the Academy wouldn't normally award such acclaim to a thriller with often grim and disturbing content - a tribute to how well crafted it is. Also worthy of a mention is the way that this film put the Behavioural Sciences unit of the FBI on the map - that unit devoted to the study of the most deviant ""human"" beings among us. Director Jonathan Demme shows a great skill for the genre, and with the assistance of a first rate crew creates some eerily effective suspense. Based on the novel by Thomas Harris, it stars Jodie Foster as an eager beaver young FBI trainee who is sent by her superior (Scott Glenn) to interview an imprisoned murderer, the intelligent, cultured psychopath Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), in the hopes that he can lend his insight into the activities of ""Buffalo Bill"" (Ted Levine), a serial killer currently on the loose. Other than a music score by Howard Shore that is a little *too* over the top and manipulative, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" hits all the right notes, telling a story in a taut and convincing manner. The subject matter admittedly is not to every taste - especially when one thinks about what Bills' ultimate plan is. The editing (by Craig McKay), production design (by Kristi Zea), and cinematography (by Tak Fujimoto) are exemplary; among the scariest scenes are Clarices' (Foster) search of a storage space, and the climactic action where agent and maniac are finally face to face (and the sequence leading up to that). Of course, the real meat of the story is the unusual relationship between the charismatic Lecter and the determined Clarice, as he demands she divulge personal information in return for his thoughts on the Buffalo Bill case. Lecter is a truly memorable character, from his choice of entertainment to the way that he gleefully toys with those people that he holds in contempt. Hopkins and Foster are both very effective in these parts, although the contributions of the supporting cast absolutely should not go overlooked. Given the way that Lecter dominates the proceedings, it's important to point out just how extremely creepy Bill is; his performance brought character actor Levine to real prominence. Brooke Smith is very good portraying a would-be victim who actually tries to use her wits and fight back in some way. Also appearing are many other familiar faces: Anthony Heald (as the smarmy jerk in charge of the insane asylum), Diane Baker, Kasi Lemmons, Demme regulars Charles Napier and Tracey Walter, his old mentor Roger Corman (as the director of the FBI), Frankie Faison, Dan Butler, Chris Isaak, and Daniel von Bargen. Even at just under two hours long, this is actually pretty taut in terms of pacing; there's no filler at all, just some very potent entertainment. This was preceded by another Harris adaptation, ""Manhunter"", in which Brian Cox played Lecter, and would be followed by ""Hannibal"" and, after that, ""Red Dragon"", another film version of the source novel for ""Manhunter"". Some people tend to prefer ""Manhunter"" and consider it superior; this viewer merely prefers to think that they each have their own heavy assets. Nine out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Balances its two key story-lines remarkably well; a complex, gripping horror film that is far more cerebral than visceral.","'The Silence Of The Lambs (1991)' balances its two key story-lines remarkably well, allowing them to bounce off and twist around each other until they become one inseparable narrative. The incredibly disciplined way in which the film restrains its two most flamboyant aspects - those being the serial killers Hannibal Lecter and Buffalo Bill - to always maintain the perspective of its rookie FBI protagonist as she navigates her way through her newfound world of silver-tongued devils and elusive monsters is both impressive and necessary in elevating the piece above what could've been simple shock value. The feature is gripping right from its opening moments and always maintains a tight grip on its psychologically complex characters who remain fully rounded no matter on which side of sociopathy - or the law - they sit. Thanks to a mature treatment of its audience, it never feels as though it is pandering or dumbing itself down, rather elevating the viewer to its own level of intelligence. The picture also knows when to pull back on the reigns too, making for an experience far more cerebral than visceral; this is something perhaps unexpected from a thriller where a serial-killing cannibal is, for all intents and purposes, one of the 'good guys'. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

She's a young woman in what is traditionally a man's world, forced to endure the degradation of constantly having ""eyes all over her body"" (and this disquieting metaphor is reinforced later on as we witness Clarice ogled through the lens of night-vision goggles). The motives of her boss and mentor Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) are somewhat dubious, and their final handshake quivers with sexual awkwardness.Hannibal Lecter perceives Clarice's dark past and recognises her strengths. He falls in love with her in a platonic sort of way (not dissimilar to how Sherlock Holmes fell in love with Irene Adler, one of the few people to have outwitted him, in ""A Scandal in Bohemia""). The moment that their fingers touch through the bars of Lecter's cell is a chilling sharing of intimacy.Thomas Harris subsequently elaborated on this relationship in ""Hannibal,"" but that novel (and, to a lesser extent, Ridley Scott's 2001 film adaptation) goes completely off the rails in its final act. Clarice Starling would've been best left alone. (Tellingly, the best parts of 'Hannibal (2001)' were those set in Florence, Italy with Giancarlo Giannini).Finally, nobody ever mentions Ted Levine's perfect performance as Jame Gumb (a.k.a. Buffalo Bill), probably because he's such an repellent character. Lecter is frequently framed in close-up, emphasising Hopkins' mesmerising, unblinking stare, and he speaks eloquently and intelligently. Jame Gumb, conversely, is kept at a distance, often swathed in poor or garish lighting, or framed in such an extreme close- up that his features appear grotesque.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A most unusual treat.,"""The Silence of the Lambs"" will have to go down in history as one of the most ingenious movies of all time. After a string of bizarre murders, FBI agent-in-training Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is hired to interview psychopath Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) to find the perpetrator. In the process, we get to learn some very interesting things about both Starling and Lecter. The main thing is that, despite how vile Lecter is, we can't help but admire him. And I don't mean just because he's helping Clarice; something about the guy, you just gotta love him.In case you're squeamish, I should remind you that this movie contains some very ugly scenes. But don't worry, director Jonathan Demme knows how to handle them. This masterful combination of acting, directing and writing helped ""The Silence of the Lambs"" win the top five Academy Awards, putting it in a league with only ""It Happened One Night"" and ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"". Watching the movie, you will agree that the movie deserved these awards. In fact, you just might want to have an old friend (over) for dinner.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Sir Anthony Hopkins is more suitable for comedy and drama,"Toxic movies that I hate forever I really believe that films like this harm not only the cinema but also our worldThe only strong point that seems to be in this movie is the few silences that Jonathan Demme has managed to capture, but it took too long and it didn't turn out well. Everything in the movie is based on a funny but very serious story.the film does not have script .And it is the only film for which the Academy has become emotional for specific reasons. The set design in the movie is awful. There is neither simplicity nor complexity in it. The story of the movie is full of bugs. The knots of the story are neither real nor fantasy, neither believable nor surreal. A film that is basically a deception. In my opinion, it could have been a more successful movie by switching the roles of Hopkins and Jodie Foster. The pleasure that the story of the movie wants to convey is very confusing and deceptive. Everything suffers from an artificial nostalgia. Not only is it unsuccessful and it never deceives the professional cinema audience, but it is so ridiculous and funny that it is unbelievable at a certain time. A movie that not only the character but also the style is not seen in it. Tasteless and, for example, tasty inserts in the movie do not advance anything. The film remains as interesting as the basic idea.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Oscar Winner? Ha! Ha!,"I saw this one at the cinema and came out wondering what all the fuss was about. It was reasonably entertaining but annoying at the same time. I like Anthony Hopkins as an actor but he was hamming it up as Lecter and made the charcter look cartoonish rather than scary. Jodie Foster gave a good impression of a woman trying to reverse out of a parking space.What surpised me most about this film was that it won several Oscars including best film. It's obvious to me now that the people at the Academy know less about film than most five year olds. Remember when Kramer v Kramer won best film, that was the year Apocalypse Now was released and who can remember the former?I've learned my lesson since then and have avoided Oscar winners such as Titanic and The English Patient. Silence of the Lambs is an above average thriller but no work of art. The plot is also absurd and goes for cheap thrills with the usual gore and when Buffalo Bill gets his kit off you simply have to yawn, it didn't shock me. As for his victim in the pit, somehow you just wish Bill would end it for the poor girl and the suffering audience.In summary!

Hannibal will always be Hannibal...,"""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a movie in which a young FBI agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) tries to get some information from Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) who is a psychopath and used to be a respected psychiatrist, for a psychopathic serial killer who skins his victims. To get these information Clarice Starling has to gain the respect and the trust of Dr.Hannibal Lecter.When I saw this movie I thought that Anthony Hopkins is really not OK in his minds for real and that's because of his perfect interpretation. I also think that Jodie Foster made an also perfect interpretation. Τhese were seen and in the Academy Awards where Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster won the Oscars for Best Actor in a Leading Role and for Best Actress in a Leading Role respectively. Jonathan Demme's work in the direction of this film did not go unnoticed and he also won the Oscar for Best Director.""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a movie that you have to see it, it's a really good Thriller and Crime movie with many good scenes and an exceptional screenplay.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Dr. Lecter will see you know...,"The Silence of the Lambs is one of the rare horror films that convinced much of the American public, and even the Academy Awards, that horror doesn't have to always be about gore, excess violence, and extremism. In fact, horror can stem from many different aspects, one of them being psychological, which is the subgenre that the film caters to. Through use of strong acting and an interesting story, the film manages to explain why it etched itself into the list of greatest American films ever made simply by existing and going what nobody thought its own genre could do.The film stars Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling, who is pulled from her training at an FBI academy by Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn), who works for a unit in behavioral sciences. Jack grants Clarice the honor of meeting one-on-one with former psychiatrist and serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), who is also known for cannibalistic crimes. Lecter's knowledge is requested because of a serial killer nicknamed ""Buffalo Bill"" currently running rampant in the streets, who is highly-publicized and known to skin the corpses of his female victims.Upon arriving at the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, Clarice meets a surprisingly mannered and well-articulate man that is Hannibal Lecter and not the psychotic murderer one would believe. What unravels is a strange relationship between an FBI trainee and an insane mental patient. Starling has to get close to Lecter for his knowledge and insight into the crimes of ""Buffalo Bill,"" but also must refrain from dangerously close connections which could instantly spark something detrimental to her well-being.The first thing to marvel at with this film is how it utilizes its talent, plunging Foster and Hopkins into a story and set of circumstances that need to be well acted in order to be believable and gripping; both veteran talents do not slump here. Foster gives a very solid performance as Clarice, that is mostly successful at avoided the often alienating tropes that result when we focus on cops or undercover investigators for two hours. Then there's Hopkins, in a role he has become known for for good reason. Hopkins instantly clicks here as Lecter, provoking fright and unsettled nerves with viewers. Rather than over-the-top zaniness, Lecter relies on quiet, mannered acting techniques that are all the more frightening because of how out of the ordinary and unexpected they are from a man of his caliber. This leads the viewer to ping-pong back and forth with the idea that Lecter is really a misunderstood victim or an amazingly talented con-artist.Then there's the mounting tension on display here, largely thanks to Jonathan Demme's direction and Ted Tally's screenplay. The film plays like a true detective story, utilizing slowburn and patient tension in order to achieve a great, suspenseful result. These kinds of films hold up because they deliver something new each time one sees them. This being my first time viewing The Silence of the Lambs one gets the idea that even after seeing it, watching it again would be a great experience because it would allow you to pay more attention to the serene details of the film and how the end result came to be.With strong work behind the camera, and equally strong work in front, there's really no shock that The Silence of the Lambs came out the way it did, a strong and capable psychological thriller/horror film that beautifully relies on nuances and mannerisms rather than shock and awe. The fact that the film may have lead some to look at the horror genre with a bit more respect in the short-run would maybe be a stronger statement if horror didn't go south in the long-run. But that's another blog/review for another time.Starring: Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, Scott Glenn, and Ted Levine. Directed by: Jonathan Demme.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the best suspense films of the early 1990's,"Silence of the Lambs is a film that will always be memorable because of 2 things (in my mind)- 1, Hopkins brilliantly mixed type of Socrates meets Dawn of the Dead zombie charicature and 2, an argument will go on like who was the better Darren on Bewitched, Jodie Foster playing Clarice Starling (and version of herself in 10 years Julianne Moore).  I feel that Jodie Foster is very good here as a FBI agent who has to get in the mind of Dr. Lecter (Faba beans and all) to find a killer.  Story latter patterned out in The Cell, which while that was better, this film is a tad better than the sequel by having you sqeam in your seat while getting memorable catch phrases and (dare I say) laughs.

A Chilling Masterpiece,"The Silence of The Lambs is one of my all time favourite movies which surprises me because I am very much not a horror movie fan but I adore this movie it just does everything right not just in terms of a thriller but as a movie as well. Probably the most iconic thing about this movie is the characters and every character has something interesting about them whether it be an unhinged serial killer that has nothing else to lose or a young FBI agent trying to find her way in the world and the latter is what makes Clarice Starling such an excellent protagonist she gives the audience something to relate to in this film and Jodie Foster is absolutely amazing in this film she perfectly captures her characters wit, innocence and fear and is never anything less than convincing. But in the end it was Anthony Hopkins incredible turn as iconic serial killer Hannibal Lector that truly stole this movie. The film takes its time to build up Lecter as an antagonist so that when he isn't on screen were dying for him to return and makes Hopkins performance all the more terrifying. Make no mistake this movie is not for the faint of heart it has a lot of blood, guts and gore but all the violence serves a purpose it allows us to get sucked into this world and know just how much theses characters mean business. While Hannibal Lector is An Antagonist in this film he isn't the main one the main focus of this film is the Hunt for deranged serial killer Buffalo Bill. Not only is the mystery and hunt for him just incredibly interesting to watch but it makes the film an entertaining one its not just a compilation of death scenes it's what gives this movie it's rewatch value along with the scenes where Starling and Lector just talk. We learn so much about these two people in these scenes not just thought exposition but by the way they act towards one and other revealing both of their insecurities.I Can't think of a single person who doesn't at least like this movie it's just so lovable with amazing performances and an excellent main mystery.A+-100%",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Overrated,"It's a really good movie... but to me - it doesn't align with the overall IMDb rating. Don't get me wrong - it is a great movie... the storytelling is good. The acting was great too, in particular - Anthony & Jodie were perfect in their roles.
But the movie did become a little bit boring towards the end and I was willing for it to wrap up. Perhaps because something major happened in the middle portion of the movie, and then after that it quickly went flat. The ending was bland. I've watched it twice now, and I've felt the same both times. I much prefer 'Red Dragon' over this one. I easily gave that a high rating.

"Overrated, intellectualized, ritualized trash heap!","This movie is just a mess from beginning to end. First of all, actors and actresses have a tendency to overact, so writers and directors will always try to throw realism out the window so that they can indulge themselves! While the character of Dr. Lecter is not technically impossible, it is highly unlikely. Sociopaths in real life are much more likely to be low functioning, impulsive, and not very good book learners. So this movie starts off with a bad premise. I'm not a very big fan of Jodie Foster movies to begin with, and her character is very annoying to me. The best part of the entire film is the Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine) scenes. The idea that Lecter would give Starling such highly intellectualized clues is improbable, but I suppose I am being overly critical here. This is still less annoying than Manhunter, but not by much!!",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Mindblowing psycho thriller!!! *spoilers*,"I have seen almost all the major titles in IMDb top 100 but this one stands out on its 17 minutes camera time. All the fans must know what that means, Dr Lecter blows your psyche away with those close face camera shots (superb cinematography, best I have seen), penetrating eyes, unflinching wilfuly crafted dialogs and layer by layer account of psycho analysis of a crime and criminal.I watched this movie last night only and I wasn't able to sleep properly, the intense sequences and the confrontations between lecter and clarice were so dramatic and real, they totally grips your psyche and pulls it deeper and deeper inside the mind of a serial criminal slowly making you believe the thin line dilemma between how criminal a crime could be and the other side of the delusion.Silence of the lambs is mainly about 3 characters, Clarice, Lecter and Bill. Clarice (Foster) is a young FBI agent sent as a curve ball after failed attempts to grill Dr Lecter (Hopkins, hail hopkins, generation after generation will praise thy performance as the greatest screen presence and portrayal of a psychotic cannibal), the motive for which changes gradually in getting Lecter to catch a dreaded serial psychopath killer, lady skinner, Buffalo bill. As the movie progresses, you feel the synchronicity between Clarice and Lecter so amazing, their eyes doing the communication and you reading between the intervention.Especially the escape from prison scene of Dr lecter and initial confrontation of Clarice with Dr Lecter when you get the justification for the title is awesome and mind boggling cinema at its best.My personal favorite: Lecter kills the policemen and then looks up with light focused on his face and his face covered with blood while he tuning his finger to symphony with closed eyes in peace.Kudos Hopkins! 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

This is a story of a young FBI Trainee, for lack of a better term, brought on board and investigation into the kidnapping and murder of women. Agent Starling, played here flawlessly by Jodi Foster, is a psyche major. She is asked to talk to a notorious serial murderer name Hannibal Lecter, or Hannibal the cannibal, played by the Great Hopkins. It is hoped that Lecter can shed some light on who is perpetrating the murders, as his latest kidnapped victim is a senator's daughter.

"A Sick and Twisted, yet smart and satisfying thriller","Films don't usually get as creepy or thrilling as the top-notch, first-class creepy and chilling thriller known as Silence of the Lambs. There is nothing that can take your breath away with so much style and wit like Silence of the Lambs does. You'll need to watch this film in order to understand how thrillers are created and executed.The young and feminine Clarice Starling, who is training to be an F.B.I. agent, must find the whereabouts of a serial killer named Buffalo Bill. The only way possible is interviewing a captured serial killer named Dr. Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter.Hannibal Lecter is perhaps the best movie villain that ever lived. Anthony Hopkins plays his role with perfection, because you will hear Lecter's voice stuck inside your head. ""I ate his liver with fava beans and a nice chianti,"" will re-play in your head over and over. Hopkins deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of the most sinister character on the big screen. Creepy, sinister, devilish, clever and cannibalistic-How much better can it get? If the villain isn't enough to entertain you, then perhaps the hero will.Jodie Foster, also a gem as the role, plays the feminine F.B.I agent in training, Clarice Starling. She is seemed to be well-liked (often flirted with) but insecure and very timid. Starling is very realistic, and shows how timid the human nature can be.At a first viewing, all I could keep my mind on was the prison escape scene. I kept repeated the phrase ""Oh God,"" and kept preparing myself for what was next. During a second viewing I realized the depth of the story line and the genius behind it all.One thing this movie definitely has is atmosphere. The killings, the characters, the dialog, and everything else that leads up to the first appearance of Hannibal Lecter makes the film look so delightfully creepy. Even though Hannibal is silent when we first see him, it is considered one of the creepiest introductions ever made. Of course, we can't forget about this man. Even after the ending, he delivers one last line that sends shivers down our spines.Silence of the Lambs may make you a bit disgusted, yet thrilled and excited.

That was a significant number of years ago, and I thought I would appreciate it more, now that I am learning more about the art of film (and in extension, television) making. And that was precisely the case. With that in mind, I decided to also watch The Silence of the Lambs.I had never seen this movie before, and oh my goodness, is this movie intense. This is the kind of horror I admire. There is barely any jumpscares or wacky visual effects to scare you, this film actually creeps up on you, which is much more terrifying. I especially love how Hannibal Lecter is introduced, which is through the dialogue between other people. Done properly, this technique can provide an effective build-up for a character before he/she is seen on screen.I could spend more time arguing why I think this movie is worth its five Oscars, but the bottom line is that this movie got me hooked. For the entirety of its runtime, this film reminded me why I love film as an art form. What it can do, how it can stick with me, how it can dazzle and amaze me. All I want to add is: Please go see it for yourself.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Best film ever made,"Silence of the lambs is without doubt the best film ever made with the exception of Hannibal.The film puts you on the edge of your seat all the way through and the actors are all brilliant (especially Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins).The book is also fantastic so if you haven't read it then GO BUY IT.And for any women put off because you think its a man's film because of the guns and violence .Don't think that,its totally for both. The plot is totally brilliant,young Clarice starling set in by the FBI to interview a killer.You will be utterly gripped.It is totally enjoyable and is a great film.Plus if you like it you can see the others two films that go with it,Red Dragon and Hannibal.Which are also excellent.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
An Exercise In Creepiness,"Every once in awhile, a film comes along that introduces a character so original that it is impossible to turn away. ""Silence of the Lambs"" is exactly this type of experience.For a basic plot summary, ""Silence of the Lambs"" sees young FBI agent Clarice Starling (Jodi Foster) given her first assignment: interrogate Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lector (Anthony Hopkins), a former psychologist-turned-psychopath. In trying to glean some information from Hannibal about the grizzly ""Buffalo Bill"" murders, Clarice catches the caged madman's sense of gamesmanship and enters into a battle of wits with the thought-provoking Lector.This film primarily works because of the Hannibal Lector character. From out of nowhere, he becomes one of the most iconic villains in cinema history. He's clearly a crazed personality (as evidenced by his cannibalistic tendencies), but at the same time he is utterly brilliant ability to dissect the inner human psyche. His inner battle of wits with Agent Starling is incredibly interesting material that never gets old no matter how many times it is viewed.However, the film is also just an overall general masterpiece in pretty much all areas. The basic plot involving the Buffalo Bill maniac is chilling (especially the heart-pounding ending), the music is also creepily in the background, and the visuals are scary while still managing to be realistic.Simply put, this is one of the greatest suspense thrillers ever made. It created an iconic character, launched the career of Jodi Foster, and carved itself a place in many ""greatest of all- time"" lists. I've viewed it multiple times and it always seems to evoke the same creepy emotions every single time (the mark of a truly chilling viewing experience).",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Good first half, but poor second half.","For the first half I give 4/5 and 2/5 for the second.Jeez, this has to be one of the most undeserving films to sweep the oscars and the most overrated film of all time. Maybe back in the day it would be something groundbreaking, but after having watched so many great films, I don't see anything in this film that makes it deserve so much hype. Hence I find it extremely overrated.The first half is good. It almost convinced me the hype around it is real. But as the second half started, I started getting bored and could not see what's so great about this. It did not seem interesting at all. Even the best scene of the entire film which is the cage scene, it's nothing I've not seen before. I'm fact they are much more intriguing and riveting in newer films. I get why people would've loved it back in the day, but having watched a tonne of films it didn't seem exciting to me.Lot of plot holes in this one. Supposed ""smart"" characters doing dumb things. It is too predictable. The film in itself is entertaining. You're looking forward to what will happen next despite knowing the outcome of the characters' actions. Thus, it's worth a watch. But I repeat, far too overrated imo. I know this word is used a lot, but that's only cuz it's true in this case.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

an eerie and gripping story that you won't soon forget,"A serial killer known by authorities only as ""Buffalo Bill"" is on the loose kidnapping and brutally murdering unsuspecting women across the Midwest. Clarice Starling is a young, astute, but inexperienced FBI agent trainee (with lots of emotional baggage) assigned to work the case after another woman/potential victim goes missing. Starling's only chance to crack the case is to enlist the aid of Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a brilliant and manipulative psychiatrist now imprisoned for cannibalism. Startling, powerfully acted thriller is tough to take at times, but is brilliantly crafted, consistently gripping, and effectively explores the depths of the criminal mind. Not for all tastes, but a formidable and unforgettable addition to the genre that serves as a terrific showing for all those involved. ***½",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Of it's time,"This is a movie that really doesn't live up to today's hype of how classic and wonderful it should be. The cinematography is messy, the plot points are stitched together the same way somebody would sew a rip in a shirt if they forgot their glasses that day. The climax of the movie was predictable, full of jump scares, it didn't make me think it didn't intrigue me. The introduction of Dr. Lecter was very well done but from then on, what happened? Not ""what happened"" like i'm leading you somewhere with this so i mean it rhetorically. Now ""what happened"" in the way that would give the term literally meaning i.e. 'what happened next?' so i mean it in an investigative sense. ""What happened"" as in the bad joke people like to tell when they see baby pictures ""you were such a cute kid- what happened?"". I mean it in the way that your mom meant it when, as a kid, she told your to clean your room and she'll check in 20 minutes and she walks in to what she thinks will be your room being clean or you cleaning but what turns out to be you sitting on the floor distracted by a toy. Hannibal's character started out strong (inconsistent, a little. why would they let you have a pencil in jail? they would not) and when you needed the very core and basis of his character's backstory to come forward and grab you he was on the floor playing with toy trucks. That is not to say Anthony Hopkins performance was the same as his character's writing- not at all. Hopkins is a rare breed when it comes to acting. Everything he does is spectacular- even if he has a disappointing character he will deliver a great performance. I can't say the same about his female counterpart. After this movie, it's been so hard for me to like Jodie Foster. The whole concept of Hannibal falls so flat with this movie but you gotta give credit to the starter of the trends",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Silence is Golden,"Funny how I hadn't seen 'Silence Of The Lambs' ever since it was just finishing it's theatrical run back in 1991. Hopkins, Foster and Demme have gone on to do other things of course, but I recently caught this again on DVD again, and man, this still has a lot of ability to scare you out of your wits. Anthony Hopkins is just wild in his Academy Award winning performance. I find it amazing that I was getting chills up my spine just from watching him play Lecter. This is the best of his Lecter performances, as the other movies (that would be Hannibal and Red Dragon (though they were okay) lack the dramatical oomph so prevalent in this one. One wonders how on earth Hopkins could do this then do something like a light comedy like Spotswood (which is exactly what he did).

One of the best thrillers ever,"In this film, the young and inexperienced FBI Agent Starling will need the help of Hannibal Lecter, a dangerous and manipulative cannibal, to capture a serial killer. Directed by Jonathan Demme, it has screenplay by Ted Tally, and has the participation of Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins. Won five Oscars (Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay; was also nominated for Best Sound and Best Editing).This film needs no introduction and has already become a classic. The Hanibal character is a horror icon and consecrated Hopkins as one of the greatest masters of representation of the late twentieth century. Decidedly, watching this film, we have the notion that all factors combined, in the ideal measure, to make a piece of art that, even so, due to the topic and some more shocking scenes, is not suitable for sensitive people.The script is excellent and works in a masterly manner, without errors or holes. The work of director was essential for the success of the film, along with the performance of the actors themselves. In fact, even the supporting actors in the film were very good in their roles, although the spotlight have been under the heads of Hopkins and Foster. The two actors were brilliant, the way they interact is a drama lesson. The penetrating gaze of Hopkins, and his viperous cynicism, are one of the registered marks of the film. The rest (sets, costumes, photography and soundtrack) is impeccable. It's a great movie, recommended to those who like a suspense story.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Classic,"To me, this is the epitome of movie making: A film that can make you feel sorry for the characters, make you smirk at their quips, make you gasp in horror or revulsion, and hold you in its awe all in two hours.There is a reason this film was given Best Picture (a departure for the Academy); there is a reason Hannibal Lecter was given the honors for greatest cinematic villain; there is a reason that among many, the film is considered to be better than the book its based on. It will do me no good to tell you these reasons, just see the film.Don't bother with the other two Hannibal films, although Red Dragon is mostly worth seeing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

One of the all time definitive serial killer movies,"The Silence of the Lambs surprised everybody by winning all five major Oscars and being only the third film, as well as the last, to achieve this. I say 'surprised' not because it was an unworthy winner, quite the contrary, but because it is only once in a blue moon when the Academy acknowledges any R rated film with any awards such as these.Based pretty closely on the riveting Thomas Harris novel of the same name, this was the second film to feature his character Hannibal Lecter, the first being the Michael Mann thriller Manhunter (1986). Both movies take differing approaches to their broadly similar material but where the earlier film is almost clinically stylised, Lambs is a little more horror-oriented. This extends to Anthony Hopkins performance of refined malevolence as Lecter, which was one that would propel him to super-stardom. From his first appearance in a cell that looks not unlike a medieval dungeon, Hopkins is in his element playing this extremely interesting character in such a way as to maximise all possibilities. He really steals every scene he is in and this is no disrespect to Jodie Foster who is the definite lead, she also puts in an extremely good turn overall but this will always primarily be remembered as being Hopkins movie. That said, much of the overall credit has to go to director Jonathan Demme for putting together a masterfully paced and edited film, while remaining very faithful to the source novel.The story has a top FBI student Clarice Starling assigned to a special case where she is to interview incarcerated cannibalistic serial killer Hannibal Lecter as a way to help identify another murderer at large known as Buffalo Bill. In doing so she is forced to let Lecter into her mind, with all the inherent psychological dangers that presents.The Silence of the Lambs remains a very effective thriller that focuses its attention mostly on the psychological, yet is memorably visceral on occasion too. It's pretty intense in places, with all of the scenes involving Buffalo Bill being extremely creepy indeed. But it's also the various details of the investigation that make a huge impact. Layer upon layer of dark intrigue is slowly and expertly revealed to ultimately construct a dark masterpiece. What gives it its extra level of greatness of course is the script and performances. All-in-all, a justifiably revered and iconic film that still packs a punch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Quintessential Suspense Horror!,"One of the most intense, bone-chilling & edge-of-the-seat experiences I've ever had at movies, The Silence of the Lambs is a masterpiece of suspense, sustained thrills & nail- biting terror that blends the elements of horror, crime & psychology into one tightly packed & smoothly narrated story, features precision level of craftsmanship in all departments of filmmaking, and benefits immensely from exceptional performances turned in by its cast.Based on the novel of the same name, The Silence of the Lambs follows young FBI cadet Clarice Starling who's pulled out from her training and is assigned a new task that requires her to interview the notorious psychiatrist & cannibalistic serial killer Hannibal Lecter for his inputs can provide possible clues that may help them apprehend another serial killer known as ""Buffalo Bill"" who likes to skin his victims. Things get interesting when Lecter takes an interest in Starling's life.Directed by Jonathan Demme, this psychological horror introduces its chilling sense of dread right from the moment Howard Shore's score hits the screen, and it only gets more unsettling from there on. Demme's direction is top-notch for he really understands what this film is supposed to be, and leaves no stone unturned to make it as gripping as possible. Of all the films he's made in his filmmaking career, The Silence of the Lambs remains his finest effort to date and is one cinema he will be remembered for.Ted Tally's screenplay also deserves a mention for the script packs in a tightly structured plot, fleshes out its characters amazingly well and never for once deviates from the main storyline. All the themes are smartly addressed, every character has a well-defined arc, the attention to detail is very impressive, each storytelling element is nailed to perfection and there's just nothing to complain about. Even the technical aspects are executed in a manner that's always in the service of its story & characters.The sets pieces are wonderfully detailed & well-lit. The camera makes heavy use of close- ups which brings a creepiness of its own while the balanced colour tones & minimal lighting further enhances its dark ambiance. Each sequence is relevant to the story, the whole film is methodically paced and each scene sets up the next one in queue. Last but not the least, the background score by Howard Shore consists of tracks that encapsulate the whole story with a tense, foreboding atmosphere which further amplifies the entire experience by a considerable extent.Coming to the performances, The Silence of the Lambs features a terrific ensemble in Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, Scott Glenn & Ted Levine. While Foster delivers her finest work as Clarice Starling, Hopkins' rendition of the brilliant psychiatrist & cannibalistic serial killer Hannibal Lecter is beyond excellence and his spot-on chemistry with Foster turns every single conversation between Lecter & Starling into an instant classic moment. Glenn does well as Jack Crawford and Levine is just as good as Foster or Hopkins even if it often gets overshadowed by their inputs.On an overall scale, The Silence of the Lambs is one of the greatest films ever made and a timeless masterwork of smart direction, taut screenplay, splendid camera-work, tight editing, ominous score & stellar performances that exemplifies just how great a movie can become when all the right ingredients come together & work in harmony to form a complete whole. Absolutely deserving of all its accolades, immortal for its contribution to cinema as well as pop culture, and notorious for bringing on screen arguably the most cunning, charming & feared psychopath, this quintessential suspense horror comes very highly recommended.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Solid Thriller,"The Silence of the Lambs, while imperfect, is a pretty decent thriller. It's a major slow-burn, which is a turn-off for a lot of people, but it's well worth it to stick it through to the end.
The majority of this film involves detective work in an effort to track down a killer by the name of Buffalo Bill before he can kill the latest in a series of young women gone missing that have all been suspected to be him. A young student is thrust into the heart of the action, first interviewing Lecter directly in an effort to get him to talk and then, unwittingly, being in the middle of everything.I have a few issues with this movie. Sure, the last 20 minutes are heart-pounding tension, but the buildup to get there is just a little bit too much. The film is bulky, and because of that it really drags a couple of times throughout. There are moments you just want to skip past to get to ""the good stuff,"" which is never a good look for a film. This very easily could've been condensed to an 85-90-minute film without making it noticeably poorer. The second issue is the fact that no student would ever be given access to such risky and potentially dangerous subject matter. It's just not realistic. This film uses the concept of transsexualism and gender reassignment as a point of shock-based humour, which absolutely doesn't age well today and only serves to paint the film in a disrespectful light by today's standards.Overall, it's a pretty solid film. A great thriller, but a lousy and bloated horror film. With a little bit of the fat trimmed off the meat (no pun intended), this film would be much more comfortable to slip into (pun intended). It's award-winning and it's certainly cemented it's position in cinematic history (rightfully so) but it's just not something I can see myself giving repeat viewings to.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

best horror ever,"This is the best horror movie ever made for several reasons. While the story is terrifying and grizzly, Demme never lets it become schlocky or sensational. He plays is straight, so to speak, never letting the plot become secondary. Perhaps a more... ambitious, director would have added more creepy atmosphere (like David Fincher does with ""Se7en""), but Demme smartly keeps it real, which makes it all the more terrifying. Nothing that happens in this movie couldn't happen in real life (and it does happen). This approach also harnesses the lead performers. He never lets Foster get too melodramatic, and never lets Hopkins become a flat Halloween mask. As frightening as the film is, there is a moral core throughout that neither hides completely nor brow-beats you. I have a bunch of videos and DVD's, but when almost any friend comes over and looks them over, they always want to watch ""Silence of the Lambs."" It's uncanny.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Excellent!,"When I first saw the trailer to this in the theaters, I was instantly interested in it, so I read the book before it's release.  Although movies seldom live up to the respective novels in which their based, this one equals it, but in different ways.  I have to hand it to Ted Tally for his script adaptation; his script keeps the core of the story while stripping away the more complex and unnecessary aspects of the novel and still makes it suspenseful and interesting.  The acting is magnificent, Foster plays Clarice with what looks like such ease, and yet keeps the character complex, smart, strong, and comfortably flawed, and aware of those flaws.  Hopkins is equally brilliant as Lecter: he is everything Clarice is but more charming and unaware he possesses any flaws at all.  One of the things I love about the film is it's simplicity.  The sets and clothes look normal, unimportant, everyday, cheap.  Nothing's flashy or overly ornate looking.  It still holds up very well after 13 years.  Won Oscars for Best Actor, Actress, Adapted Screenplay, Director, and Picture.  Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I've learned to appreciate fava beans!,"Johnathon Demme's The Silence of the Lambs (1991) is perhaps an anomaly - it's not your average slasher horror film or predictable thriller, which have come to dominant the genre. The haunting performances and psychological interaction between the characters, coupled with the presence of a strong female character, makes for an eerie production that brings raw emotion into the thriller genre. The plot is undoubtedly intense and well-written. However, it's not so much the story-line as the performances of the actors that make Silence a must-see. Hopkins' control and almost monotone high-pitched voice takes sadistic lines to a whole new level. His gaze brought shivers down my spine as he delves into Clarice's psyche. But Clarice can hold her own against the former psychiatrist. Foster plays her character as young and innocent, but not to a fault. She uses Clarice's naivety and lack of experience as an advantage to stand up to Lector, which he, in turn, finds admirable.Yes, there are a few gory scenes, but the implied wickedness, the spine-tingling suspense, and the electrifying, terrifying chemistry between the two leads will keep you on the edge of your seat. The actors all did their homework on serial killers and the people who strive to catch them and that effort paid off. The Silence of the Lambs captured the imagination and attention of American moviegoers like few Horror films have. Perhaps this is due in part to the fact that most didn't realize they were watching a Horror film to begin with. I'm sure Chianti sales skyrocketed, perhaps even sales of fava beans.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Masterpiece, My favorite movie of all-time! ( A+ Movie) My Ratings 10/10","The greatest horror thriller ever made. Jonathan Demme's psychological horror thriller The Silence of the Lambs (1991) is a masterclass in creative filmmaking, poignant acting, and striking visual storytelling. Demme directs The Silence of the Lambs with an eye for visual metaphors whether it's FBI agent Clarice Starling, played by the endearing Jodie Foster, standing meekly as a short female FBI student among her tall male co-workers. Demme keeps you gripped by showing you crime evidence photos, realistic corpses of victims, cuts to the killer's activities, and showing consultations with an infamous cannibal doctor. Demme's direction is intriguing with a constant unnerving representation of killers or their victims. You are forced to follow Starling's investigation into the brutal killings of a madman named Buffalo Bill. It's a creative cinema masterpiece as it remains always entertaining and genuinely chilling. Howard Shore's score is unsettling with subtle eerie melodies and soaring scary themes rushing around the gruesome crimes herein. Shore composes memorable music for The Silence of the Lambs that continues to frighten any audience that dares to view this classic movie. Notably, Jodie Foster gives her arguably her greatest performance in The Silence of the Lambs, and she was in Taxi Driver! Foster brings a sincere warmth, sympathetic trauma, inspiring gusto, and engaging intelligence to her role as Clarice Starling. She's an ambitious and cool FBI woman with top ranking in her class and a desire to become a real FBI agent. I love how Foster depicts the investigative process as serious and rational, especially in the face of crazy, seemingly random killings. Foster finds Clarice's earnest approach to communicating with a flesh craving cannibal and brings Clarice a clarity of conscious and morality that is fascinating in every scene. I appreciate Jodie Foster in The Silence of the Lambs more with each viewing of Jonathan Demme's iconic film. Of course, most remember Sir Anthony Hopkins in his groundbreaking performance as serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lecter also known as Hannibal the Cannibal. Hopkins never blinks to throw you off balance in his imposing staring portrayal is simply marvelously creepy. Hopkins boasts a frightening stocky stature and suddenly violent physicality to his Hannibal that makes his Lecter even scarier than Brian Cox's archetypal portrayal back in Michael Mann's Manhunter. Hopkins plays the psychological torture by the doctor's words toying with Clarice to perfection. He is curious and cruel with malicious intent and shocking again and again. Hopkins will never not scare me anytime I see him as Hannibal Lecter. I should mention Scott Glenn is great as the FBI head Jack Crawford. His accidental sexism is beautifully portrayed by the nuanced Glenn. He is steadfast as a lawman, but always belittles Clarice, while encouraging her work. It's an interesting bit of acting and writing for an interesting character. Anthony Heald is so slimy and creepy and the sadistic narcissist Dr. Frederick Chilton. Last, but surely not least, Ted Levine is absolutely terrifying as the serial killer Jame ""Buffalo Bill"" Gumb. His feminine body language, effeminate voice, lithe appearance, brutal physicality, crafty killing, and playful attitude all culminate in the vicious atrocity of Buffalo Bill's character. Levine plays up the fact that Bill thinks he's a transsexual so well that you are fearful of his sudden changes in personality and masculinity. He embodies both masculine and feminine traits, thus creating a nebulous figure in Buffalo Bill. His character can be anyone and that's what makes him so scary. Levine's acting during the ""tuck"" scene as well as while meeting Clarice is just wonderful acting. Ted Levine is more versatile than I feel critics and audiences are willing to give him credit for as Levine is every bit a monstrous and scary as Hopkins' Hannibal. Overall, The Silence of the Lambs demands to be seen and will haunt you forever after witnessing all its glorious filmmaking and stunning crime.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

doing this for collage work. like the film though,"This review will finally cover one of my favourite films of all time, Silence of the Lambs. In this film you follow the story of Clarice Starling (Jodie Forster) on her journey to join the FBI. She will do this by doing the tests required; however she is also trying to catch the evil transgender psychopath Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine). To do this job she has to call in the help of the FBI's most dangerous captive, Dr Hannibal Lecter played by Anthony Hopkins. To find him she allows Dr Lecter to get into her head to allow him to look at the files. The slow pacing mixed with tense scenes allow for a quality which was not scene before and has not really seen since. I love this film so I can be considered bias towards the film, however that bias does have some serious points, the acting is top class from everyone, especially Hopkins, and he adopted the role of a pure psychopath toying with his pray while keeping a civil look about him. Jodie Foster allows for the audience to get behind her and bond with her as a character, allowing for the audience to gain a sense of fear towards the end. The cinematography used throughout the film adds lots of things to the suspense, giving lots of close ups and allowing for the audience to get used to the lighting, music and gives a sense of fear. The lack of music ads to this as well as the music that is used is twisted and makes the listener feel unnerved. Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill works perfectly, he acts weak and fearful however when he is in a scene where he is in control, he is calm and collected, but most of all, cruel. The story is well written coming mostly from the book of the same name by Thomas Harris, winning the Bran Stoker award for best novel. The main point of the film is great, trying to entertain through an air of suspense and with a satisfying payoff. The loyalty to the original source material allows for a built up story with the correct pacing which allows the story to flow. The only flaw I could find is that they changed the ending from the original book; however even that point is asinine as the ending of the film is just as good as the book. My overall opinion? Love the film and the book from cover to cover I rate it a fantastic 5 stars. An all-time classic, definitely worth watching more than once",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Classic,This movie is highly regarded as a classic and has won many awards. I have to agree that it is a classic and it deserved all those awards.. This movie kept me intrigued.

"Outstading Drama with a Thrilling Plot and Superb Performances,","The Silence of the Lambs is a fantastic movie with a very well developed plot and an outstanding cast. It is a pure thriller and likely one of the best ever made, it does not just rely on being creepy, but also on strong performances, which I don't think thrillers do often enough.Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins's performances are absolutely outstanding. Foster is a very likable and believable police officer, and Anthony Hopkins completely becomes his character of Hannibal Lecter. It didn't seem like an easy role to do, but he did it so naturally, with no hesitation.This film won five Academy Awards and is only the third film to win the Big Five, which it completely deserved, it isn't a movie that you would expect to win Best Picture, but I am very happy it did.Dramatic, terrifying at times and without a doubt film gold, I would recommend Silence of the Lambs to anyone looking for a good thriller or drama.A young FBI agent must meet with a psychopathic serial killer in order to catch one who is still on the loose.Best Performance: Anthony Hopkins",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Impeccable well done crime/thriller,"Beautiful Jodie Foster (Clarice) investigates a sinister Buffalo Bill case and legendary Anthony Hopkins as infamous Dr. Hannibal Lector, I love this movie so much! A very meticulous detail oriented crime experience great that it's still quoted often. Silence of the Lamps is written so well that it damn well deserved the 5 Oscars it got! I think it's awesome that my mom squeezed her milk duds when she saw in the theater.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the best!,"""The Silence of the Lambs"" has been one of my favorite movies for quite a while.I actually read the book after I watched it the first time and was astounded at the differences! But then again, my vocabulary isn't too advanced and a lot of the story Thomas Harris created was a blur (the same thing happened after I saw True Grit and read the Charles Portis novel after wards.. Maybe its just a thing I have with seeing the movie first). I'm not saying the book wasn't good, but I'm more of a visual person, so watching the movie a second time was all the more interesting and just as suspenseful.I swear, Anthony Hopkins is the creepiest human being portraying Thomas Harris's Hannibal Lecter. He isn't exactly the main character, for that spot was taken up by Jodie Foster's portrayal of Clarice Starling, but he fascinates just as well. I was more afraid of Hannibal Lecter than the actual problem in the film, Buffalo Bill; that's how fantastic he played his part.After watching this movie about three or four times, I finally decided to buy it on DVD! My dad and I watch it together whenever we want to, now.If you haven't already seen this 1990's classic, I suggest you do!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the Greatest Movies ever Made,"I used to think that this film was just sick. But now I've watched it, I can appreciate how thrilling and brilliant this movie is.If it wasn't for Anthony Hopkins performance as Dr. Hannibal Lector I would have rated this movie 7/10. What a stunning performance, I was amazed by how the role of the psychopathic Hannibal Lector was filled perfectly by Anthony and it couldn't have been done ant better.It is a great storyline based on the novel by Thomas Harris, and I haven't mentioned Jodie Foster's Oscar winning performance as rookie FBI agent Clarice Starling, but let's face it, Jodie Foster's performance is good but it was overwhelmed by Anthony's performance. But still two good Oscar winning performances and good acting from the rest of the cast especially Ted Levine's role as Jame Gump (Buffalo Bill).This legendary movie swept the main five Oscar's which were: Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director and Best Screenplay.The soundtrack of this movie also made the movie what it is. The soundtrack made it more dramatic and dark. As in many scenes the music increased the darkness and pure horror of this legendary thriller.Overall the Silence is one of my all time favorite's, deserved it's five Oscars, amazing acting and of course the best performance I've ever seen by Anthony Hopkins and deserves to be #23 in the top 250. A must watch but I must warn you that it is one of the most thrilling movies ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
This movie is average,"The acting in this movie is excellent from Oscar winners Jodie Foster and Sir Tony as well as Scott Glenn who was great as the FBI guy and the no-name who played the psycho (excellent job portraying an EXTREMELY ILL character) but the movie is flawed.  In reality it won Best Picture because of a severe lack of good movies (seriously, if they decided to make Speed II or Muppets from Outer Space that year, the competition would have been tougher)  The movie's big mistake was totally selling out by having Hannibal Lector escape.  This draws the movie too far away from its central plot making the movie too much about him.  The way I see it, whoever wrote it at first intended Lector to be a deep psychological informant then decided he was too cool to keep under control then decided audiences would prefer him to get out so he damages the story to appease the masses in typical Hollywood fasion, when it would have been much better for him to be locked up the whole time.  Had they stuck to having him in the asylum the whole time, the movie would be a totally psychological thirller as opposed to a cheap ""whats the nutty douche going to do next now that he's escaped"" thriller.  Huge mistake, average movie. **1/2",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

One of the Most Memorable Perfromances of All Time and a Great Film,"Words cannot describe how truly great Sir Anthony Hopkins is in this masterpiece. His Oscar-winning portrayal of Dr. Hannibal Lecter is one of the best performances of all time, and AFI actually listed him as the #1 villain in their top 50 heroes and villains list. There has never been a more creepy, scary, and at the same time, fascinating character before or since The Silence of the Lambs was released. The closest I've seen is Heath Ledger's Joker in The Dark Knight.As great as Hopkins is, let's not forget how the great the film is as a whole. Jodie Foster was outstanding as Agent Starling and she even won an Oscar for Best Actress in a Leading Role for her efforts. The film is also beautifully directed by Jonathan Demme, who also won an Oscar. For those counting, The Silence of the Lambs won five of the biggest Oscars, the other two being Best Picture and Best Writing/Screenplay based on the previously published novel of the same title by Thomas Harris.The Silence of the Lambs is one of the best films of the last 25 years and it is one of those films that any fan of great films must watch at least once in his or her life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Brilliant and hypnotic,"Though my dedication to this film sometimes freaks people out (I've been known to quote it at somewhat inopportune moments), I don't think it's anything to be ashamed of. This film is a brilliant, tightly-plotted masterpiece, a tour de force of masterful acting, absorbing dialogue, and tempo and pacing that is at once highly tense and soothingly mesmerizing. The give-and-take between Starling and Lector has an almost heartbeat-like rhythm, quiet and subtle yet extraordinarily powerful. I don't think it's inappropriate to say that this film doesn't hit any truly false notes. The main reason that my friends often won't watch this film is simply because it scares them too much -- which, I believe, is one of the film's greatest triumphs.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Clarisse, do let me know when lose lambs stop screaming","Arguably the best movie of all time. I understand that the Silence of the Lambs gets a little discredited for being gory and at times horrifying. I have never felt a rush more powerful and exhilarating than when I watched this movie. I've seen it enough where I can now quote it line by line, but the very first time I saw the movie in its entirety, I was stunned. I was blown away. I continue to get that feeling even now when I watch for the 25th time or so. As a whole, it is such a though provoking movie. Think of the plot of Se7en, the Departed, Pulp Fiction, Inception - they all make you think and really understand the movie. To me, Silence of the Lambs does that better than any other film in history. Not to mention how great Jodie Foster as FBI trainee Clarisse Starling and Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Hannibal Lector/Hannibal the Cannibal. When you watch this movie, don't take it for its goryness and horror. You have to take it for its deep meaning. The moth, the biggest symbol of the movie, as Dr. Lector says ""represents change"". As Clarisse hunts down on serial killer Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine - excellent job as well), Dr. Lector is enlisted to help her while his genius lies alone in prison. One for the ages.

Great film.,"I am not the world's biggest Jonathan Demme fan. I have to admit however that The Silence Of The Lambs is a great foray into film-making. Demme's use of close-ups are there to put you in the face of the horror that is serial killing. Hopkins performance is a stand-out one, although I didn't care for Jodie Foster's performance much at all. Foster's southern accent sounded forced and slurry. This film is tight though and at 118 minutes it never seems to be long or drawn out.

"Seen it many times already, but with every rewatch it keeps mesmirizing me time and again","""Silence of the Lambs"" is riveting from beginning to end, made with such excellent craftmanship that it deservedly won multiple oscars and dozens of awards worldwide. You just gotta see it, to believe it...What's the story all about then? Jodie Foster plays a FBI agent in search for a serial killer who rips off the skin of his female victims. And in order to better understand the way this serial killer thinks, Jodie Foster starts interviewing another notorious serial killer in jail, played by the legendary Anthony Hopkins.What makes ""Silence of the Lambs"" so irresistably suspenseful, is it's psychological mindgame played by the locked up serial killer Anthony Hopkins who is playing everybody, with his intellect and wicked """"charm""""...I must have seen it 20 times or more by now and I still get goosebumps at the end. I know exactly what is gonna happen and STILL I am THRILLED TO THE BONE!Any bad? Mind you, this is a SLOWBURNING thriller, nothing much happens in the first hour at all. This is FIRSTMOST a CHARACTER movie, not some blunt action horror flick. If you are not into pyschological slowburning mindgames, you might not immediately understand why this movie has gotten such praise. Just saying...At an personal endnote:I still remember when I saw it first. 30 years ago there was a new cinema in my hometown that featured discounted reruns of popular movies. Only 1 dollar tickets for a movie!!! The weirdest mix of people flocked to that special discount theatre, who wouldnt normally go to the movies.

excellent,"The greatest thing about lambs is that something new is discovered each time you view it. As with all psychological films, it takes multiple views to absorb the full plot and ingest the actual meaning behind the film. The dynamic between Clarice and Hannibal is possibly one of the best acting duos in history, and if you pay attention you can pick up things between the two of them that you miss during the first viewing. Each character has layers and layers to them, they are complex and difficult to understand, which is what makes this movie so incredible. A director wants his movie to be viewed over and over, and if you can;t do that with a film its too simple to be watched. Lams executes this perfectly",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The greatest horror and mystery film ever made!,"I saw this film Saturday night, on A&E, and I have to say, it is a very good film. First off, the film is highly entertaining. This is a film that will please almost everyone. It is a crime thriller, but also very much a psychological horror film. The film surely gives us a classic movie character, Hannibal Lector. The acting in this movie is amazing. I have seen a lot of evil, psychotic characters like Lector before, and always an actor plays it in an evil, maniac sort of way. So when Anthony Hopkins acted this way, I was glad, but also kind of let down(since there are a lot of performances like this). But as the film goes on, we really identify with this character, and it did take a great amount of talent to pull it off. Jodie Foster kind of came as a one-one. Yes, she pulled it off too, like in personal moments that Dr. Lector figured out about her. You can really sense her talent, but sometimes I found her to come off a bit mono-tone. BUT I guess that is how her character was, and she did greatly act all her own to this performance. The man killer, Buffalo Bill, I think Ted Levine also did a great performance, and was underrated. BUT I found the story to be kind of unoriginal at all, yes, there is nothing really primarily wrong with the screenplay, but there were some very choppy scenes, and yes, it was a very good film. In the best horror films ever made of course, but I would have liked more from Dr.Lector and Buffalo Bill...I don't know, i just have that feeling. BUT it was a very well made film, so a solid.... 9/10",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Everything you could possibly look for in cinema!,"To keep up the goody goody cannibal spirit: ""Silence of the Lambs"" is a finger-licking GREAT thriller and one of the most righteous Academy Award winners in the history of cinema. Maybe I'm just saying that because I'm a big fan of nerve-racking thrillers and, let's face it, nerve-racking thrillers hardly ever win any Oscars, but apparently all audiences as well as all critics seem to agree that ""Silence of the Lambs"" is the worthy conquerer of 5 awards in the most eminent categories. The foundations of this cinematic milestone couldn't have been better, of course, with Thomas Harris' intriguing characterizations and basic story-idea (the efficiency was already proved in 1986, with ""Manhunter"") but really a lot of the film's brilliance is added by the Jonathan Demme and his outstanding cast. Despite not having directed a lot of horror/thriller films before this, Demme's knowledge of the genres is impressive and he terrifically manages to bring a constant level of tension without ever resorting to graphic violence or explicit gore. And that's quite an accomplishment because, primarily, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" handles about a sadistic serial killer, who eats his victims, who's recruited to assist in catching another sadistic serial killer, who skins his victims! Young FBI-trainee Clarice Starling is sent to Dr. Hannibal Lector's isolated prison cell to profile the new killer Buffalo Bill. But the highly intelligent and sophisticated Lector is only prepared to reveal clues about Buffalo Bill's modus operandi in exchange for answers to personal questions regarding Clarice's childhood.Apart from being a truly exciting and rather educational serial-killer chase, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" also definitely is a compelling psychological drama-triumph! The 'Quid Pro Quo' conversations between Clarice and Dr. Lector are portrayed like highly competitive duels in which the young FBI agent isn't necessarily the weakest party! These conversations revolve on how determined both of them are willing to go in order to find out what they need to know and, simultaneously, we get to know how vulnerable Clarice actually is. These marvelous sequences appear to be even stronger thanks to the genuinely eerie and cold setting of Hannibal Lector's old, windowless cell. The camera perspectives throughout the whole film, as well as the cinematography in general, are impeccable and often trend-setting! Particularly classic is the ""parallel"" climax, which actually is a ridiculously simple and misleading trick but increases the suspense to an unprecedented high point. And then, of course, there are the acting performances but what praise can I possibly add that hasn't been said before? Anthony Hopkins is in one word hypnotic, Jodie Foster is pragmatic but truly overpowering and Ted Levine is genuinely terrifying as the personification of human complexity!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

No movie ever had me this hooked!!,"The Silence of the Lambs (1991) is a classic psychological suspense brilliant masterpiece well acted and the best thriller ever made.A psychopath known as the Buffalo Bill sows terror in the Middle West by kidnapping and murdering young pulpy women, after partially or completely skinning them. Clarice Starling, a young FBI agent, is in charge of interviewing Hannibal Lecter, a well-known former psychiatrist who has also the characteristic of a truly intelligent psychopath focused on cannibalism.I had never seen this movie before, and oh my goodness, is this movie intense. This is the kind of horror I admire. There is barely any jumpscares or wacky visual effects to scare you, this film actually creeps up on you, which is much more terrifying. I especially love how Hannibal Lecter is introduced, which is through the dialogue between other people. Done properly, this technique can provide an effective build-up for a character before he/she is seen on screen.Jodie Foster is excellent as the FBI agent ""Clarice Starling"" and Scott Glenn is low-key and effective as ""Jack Crawford."" A major part of the film is psychological more than violent as Lecter constantly taunts ""Clarice,"" while she tries her best to manipulate him to help with a case.

A hybrid of genre's that can only be described as perfection,"The1992 Academy Awards was a very specific year in the acknowledgment of great film-making, and all because of one movie, one movie that accomplished something that very few other movies have. Sweeping all five of the major Oscar awards including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress and Best Screenplay, Jonathan Demme's ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a thriller, a horror, a psychological study into the mind of the serial killer, and a very powerful example of what film can turn out to be when actors, writers and directors are all at the top of their game.Clarice Sterling (Jodie Foster) is a young FBI trainee who is pulled out of training and assigned the case of finding a serial killer named Buffalo Bill. She is sent to the mental institute to gain insight on the character by interviewing another serial killer, the notorious Hannibal Lecter, or ""Hannibal the Cannibal"", played by the great Anthony Hopkins. While Hopkin's gave one of the most chilling and disturbing portrayals I have ever seen, it's Foster's performance that keeps this movie rolling. Clarice has a troubled past, full of fear and repressed memory. Hannibal is the monster she is trying to learn from, but he is not going to give her anything without something in return, in this case, access to her deepest, darkest secrets. The relationship between these two figures is tauntingly fascinating. There's a certain poetry involved here and it's so provoking to watch. Some may call this chemistry, but I think it's just two talented actors with and an equally talented director playing their part, and doing one hell of a job.Despite my gratitude for both actor's performances, if I had to choose which one I'd call my favourite, it would have to be Jodie Foster as Clarice Sterling. I fell in love with Foster after I saw this movie. Every time I think of her now I think of those old-fashioned clothes and burgundy shoes. I think of her amazingly delicate portrayal of a woman haunted by her past yet still trying to save the life of a teenage girl. Which reminds me, one thing that was really nice to see was that it wasn't a man trying to save the day for once, it was a woman. Almost every other Ameircan movie I've seen it's always been a man saving the damsel in distress. There was never a time where a woman got to have the acknowledgment or the parade, and I think Johnathen Demme picked up on this fact and expressed it as another theme to the movie. Close to the start of the film when Clarice was on her way to the office for her assignment, she walked into this elevator and she was surrounded by huge blokes, it made her like the smallest thing ever. It was quite funny, and I think it really said something. Clarice was a woman working in a man's world, guys would often chuckle or question at her presence, and occasionally even sexually harass her in mild ways. Witnessing all this it makes you think that there's something to prove here and that it was going to be interesting to find out how it would manifest into a final ending.Jonathan Demme is probably never going to be able to do something like this ever again. It's possibly my most favourite film ever, but if not it's certainly in my top 3. It's perfectly acted, perfectly written, and perfectly directed.

The film goes beyond the typical blood and gore of most horror movies, using dialogue and subjective camera angles to draw the viewer closer to the suspense. When Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is interviewing Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins), the subjective camera angle makes the viewer feel as if they are in Starling's place and staring into the face of a psychopath. This cinematography makes the film feel like it has a first person perspective. The angles and subjective viewpoints also illustrate what it is like for Starling in a male-dominated profession.The theme of The Silence of the Lambs is facing your fear. It faces the fear that Clarice has of the lambs that she hears in her head, the fear she has that she won't be able to save Buffalo Bill's captive, Catherine. There is also the fear that is felt when Lector or Buffalo Bill merely appears on the screen. The theme ultimately climaxes when everything is seen through Bill's night vision lenses and the audience is on the edge of their seats as Clarice may or may not meet her demise.Although Hopkins and Foster are both A-list Hollywood actors, they both have an organic, real world demeanor about them which make the story much more believable because it feels like a real FBI agent is talking to an actual criminal instead of a starlet talking with a playboy. The on location scenes that were used for a majority of the film, according to the documentary that accompanied the film, made the FBI headquarters, the psychiatric facility and even Bill's home feel like actual landmarks in a serial killer's rampage. Nothing makes a movie feel more authentic and real than rough-grain film stock. The color of the film was not too bright, and with the shadows and lighting to keep the mood drab, dull, and depressing the film was able to really develop effectively.The subjective camera angles, dark mood, and lighting set a tone that has made The Silence of the Lambs the great film that it is. Before this film was released horror films used physical suspense to scare the audience but Lambs takes the physical suspense and raises it to new heights by reinforcing it with suspense built simply through the dialogue between Lector and Starling. Many films since this one have tried to add multiple layers of depth in order to make the movie better but more times than not, it just isn't applicable to the film. Fear is something that is always around us but we try our best to avoid it, The Silence of the Lambs takes fear and forces us to examine the worst types of people through an empathetic view. This is what makes it such a great fil",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Still Frightening and Crisp,"Clarice Starling is the perfect name for the protagonist of this film. A starling is a bird, a little bird, that comes in flocks. A single starling by itself is weak, innocent, vulnerable. Clarisse is harder to define, but the long 's' sound makes it sound like a wind blowing through a peaceful field. When I hear the name Clarisse, I think of a rich teenage ingénue in a blue dress leaning dreamily on a white balcony.No, Clarice Starling is not all those things, mostly because she is played by the gritty Jodie Foster, but that is the roll she is cast into at the beginning of the film. She manages to work her way out of her situation as the hunts the serial killer Buffalo Bill, but there is one man who can cast her back into it, one man who can turn her back into a ten-year-old girl and steal away all her personal secrets.Ladies and gentleman, meet the man, the legend, Hannibal Lecter. Even you've never seen this or even heard of this movie, you've heard of Hannibal Lecter. When AFI released its list of the top 50 heroes and the top 50 villains in all of cinema, Hannibal Lecter was number 1 on the villain list. It's telling that Anthony Hopkins received an Oscar for playing this character despite getting limited screen time. Hannibal can strike fear into Clarisse Starling. He can certainly strike fear into you.Humanity is afraid of smart people. Smart people can disrupt the current order of things, breezing by without breaking a sweat. Humanity is afraid of crazy people. Crazy people are unburdened by the moors of society, and have no problem breaking down boundaries. Humanity is afraid of stoic people. Stoic people can stand their ground even when the world around them turns to fire and blood, and so they can gain a leg up on their emotional brethren.Hannibal Lecter is smart, crazy, and stoic. That is a dangerous combination. Smart people are normally not crazy, and even when they are, they usually make an emotional mistake. Crazy people are normally not stoic, and even when they are, they are not smart enough to pull off their schemes. Stoic people are normally not smart, and even when they are, they typically are not crazy enough to disrupt the entire order of things.In many ways, he is the perfect villain. He even has the perfect villain name. Hannibal rhymes with cannibal, of course, but it is also the name of the famous leader of Carthage, who led elephants over the Alps in the Punic wars in an attempt to destroy the Roman Empire. Lecter, meanwhile, sounds conniving, due to both the combination of the 'l' and the 'k' sounds and its resemblance to the world lecher. It also sounds vaguely similar to the word 'specter', fitting considering his slippery, phantasmal nature. This film and the books that inspired it are great examples on how to create character names that vaguely allude to the character's personalities without being too obvious.But Hannibal isn't really the villain, now is he? He's surely not the protagonist, but he's helping Clarice on her quest to catch the real villain of the film, Buffalo Bill, a character who is interesting in his own right, but is overshadowed by Lector and Starling. But in a way, his being in the 'hero's aide' role makes him a lot more unsettling. If he were just the villain, the film would still be great, but it wouldn't be as interesting or complex, and we would lose a lot of the Starling/Lecter interactions, which are the highlights of the film.The ambiguous or outright villainous hero's aide has been done before, but usually the character in question isn't nearly as twisted or nearly as helpful. The character of Lector strikes a deep unease within the audience. His positioning within the story deepens this unease. It is not an unintended side effect that Lector's presence hangs over the story even when he is not directly in it.As of date, this is the last film to ever win the Big Five Oscars- Picture, Actor, Actress, Director, and Screenplay. It was one of the first major films of the 90's, here to signal that the light and vapid 80's had come to an end. Foster and Hopkins both deliver A-class performances, and the writing weaves together with the direction to tell a perfect story. A frightening, towering, superbly entertaining spectacle, this one film you can't bear to miss.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The movie that made history,"Silence of the lambs is the best serial killer movie ever made. Its a film that keeps getting better every time I wach it. The pacing is beyond perfect, it starts slow but as the plot thickens more and more at risk for Clarice Starling and FBI agent played by the amazing Jodie Foster, so much that she have no choice but to the psychotic cannibal killer Hannibal Lecter played by the brilliant Anthony Hopkins for advice to catch a the monster known as Bofalo Bill before many more lives are on her plane. Jodie and Hopkins are incredible as a good FBI agent and a absolutely awful man that kills to eat human flesh, just pure evil. This movie never gets boring and I just got this creepy atmosphere of hopelessnes that just take it to and hole others level. Not a movie for people who don't like darkness, but for the people who likes the black hole off meaningless this movie is the best one on the market. 10 out of 10 stars",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Fantastic!,"This film was absolutely brilliant, the atmosphere it gives out to people was great!! It kept you in suspense and thrills all throughout the film. Jodie Foster did the character of Clarice Starling justice it was refreshing to see a female play such a hard but a chilling part and she definitely done well. Well what can i say about Anthony Hopkins he just was superb he played the part so well in the sense of keeping you intrigued of what he was going to ask or say to Clarice next. Also you could see that Hannibal Lecter loved Clarice in his own way. This film will go down in history as a classic and it will never get old or grow out of date, in my eyes it will always be remembered as absolute 10 out of 10 film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Film Review,"In the movie, Silence of the Lambs, the FBI is trying to catch serial killers and learn how his mind works. The FBI sends a trainee, Agent Clarice Starling, who is played by Jodi Foster, to interview the infamous, Dr. Hannibal Lecter, who is played by Anthony Hopkins. Lecter is a cannibalistic psychiatrist. The FBI's beliefs are it takes one to know one, speaking of Lecter, knowing how the serial killer mind works, in order to catch Buffalo Bill. Buffalo Bill is murdering women across the country. The theme develops as Lecter agrees to help only if Starling will feed his morbid curiosity about her own personal life. The director uses memory flashbacks to illustrate Starling's demons. As Lecter forces her to face her own demons in life, she begins to realize how diabolical Lecter is and how bad evil can be. Lecter gets in her mind, in her thoughts, and the evil is so strong she does not think she can stop it. Along with Lecter getting into Starling's thoughts, she gets into his mind as well. Lecter has a chance to kill her and doesn't and he even calls her in the end to congratulate her on graduating from school to become an FBI agent. Being one of the scariest movies ever put into film Silence of the Lambs, keeps you on the edge of your seat for the duration of the film. Unlike many scary movies there is little gore and shock value instances, there is more of the thought of real evil, things that really go bump in the night. The director, Jonathan Demee, uses several things to keep the viewer interested in the movie, to keep you wandering when something is going to occur. The movie keeps its intensiveness because of the lighting, off camera sound effects, and the design of the sets. Some specific examples start right from the beginning such as the music as Sterling walks to the cell of Lecter is intense making the viewer feel like something is going to happen as she walks. The laughing and yelling of the prisons as she walks away put off a nervous feeling making the viewer feel like they are there. The lighting in the prison is dark and dreary; the brick walls make it seem lonely and cold. There is rust on the heater making it seem unattended to. Lecter's dialogue is very well developed with his eyes so intense, so cold, evil, again keeping your full attention to the movie, making references to the way he ate his victims. The camera angels in close when there are conversations with Hannibal, The lighting is above him to put shadows on his face making him appear more evil. These types of preludes to the way the movie is going to unfold continue throughout the movie, making sure the viewer is on edge, scared, and nervous throughout the duration of the movie like the intense music during the abduction of the women. This movie reminds me a lot of the movie ""Kiss the Girls"" with Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd, in it. The theme is similar as to serial killers abducting woman and a psychologist helping the police find the man who did it. In Kiss the Girls, Ashley Judd is the psychologist and she gets abducted, once she escapes she helps the police with the search, in turn finding another series of abductions further away with a similar signature. Both movies are suspenseful thrillers, although the director in Silence of the Lambs is much more successful in making the movie horrifying than the director of Kiss the Girls. He makes you scared, clenching to your seat, and makes you feel as though you are their.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Masterful thriller,"The first film in the Hannibal Lecter trilogy, one of the only films to win the Big Five of Oscars, generally considered to be one of the best films of all time and Anthony Hopkins's crowning achievement in acting. And that's only scratching the surface.Everything in The Silence of the Lambs is cinema at its finest. The dialogues are crafted with perfection. These are conversation that simply ooze atmosphere and hint at backstories untold. They're also very memorable and quotable. The characters are out of the ordinary in just the right way. The protagonist Clarice Starling is normal enough, except for her past. But it's the villain that has imprinted himself so permanently to our cultural consciousness. This is a man that they would have worshipped as a god in ancient times. A dark genius, who fields both his smarts and his sophistication with razor sharp focus, always with a knowing smile on the corner of his mouth. He makes even the act of cannibalism look cultured.The movie also deserves a nod for its technical qualities. The visuals and the music support the atmosphere and the mood perfectly and you'd never guess it was made with such a small budget. Money well spent indeed.The Silence of the Lambs is a thriller you must see to truly appreciate the genre. It shows that not all thrillers have to aim for hyperrealism to be successful, that there's room for ideas larger than life and that it's the characters that make it scary, not the amount of blood and dead bodies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Solid thriller with incredible performances,"""Silence of the Lambs"" is a great, solid thriller with superb performances by its two leads, Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins.  Yet I was not as thrilled (or as terrified) with it when it came out back in 1991.  I felt that its showering of Oscars and praise was slightly unwarranted.  I just don't think it's anywhere near being the greatest thriller of our day as some gushed.  With Hannibal Lector's story still breathing (in the new release ""Red Dragon""), I think that the first attempt at filming a Thomas Harris novel, Michael Mann's ""Manhunter"", was more suspenseful and interesting than ""Silence"". In all, this is a tight, well-crafted thriller.  Yet I just cannot tell you that it was worthy of being named Best Picture by the Academy...Grade: B",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
What a strong presence by Dr.Hannibal Lecter!,"I couldn't watch the whole film without being disquiet. The camera filmed him brilliantly.

The killer that we admire!,"There are two types of worthy villains: those who are so despicable that we revel in the cold- blooded personality that we look at from the outside looking in, and the one that we want to identify with. That villain can appear socially intelligent, a cunning schemer and, at times, sympathetic. In Hannibal Lecter we get both. All else is a police drama that allows Jodie Foster to star with a dismaying West Virginia accent and a propped up set of credentials that places her in a position to be at the center of it all. For me, although Foster is always interesting to look at, it is Ted Levines' ""Buffalo Bill"" that encases the chilling nature of the film because we get a glimpse of the biggest reason we watch horror films. What drive the evil found in mankind. Levine gives us a chilling and fascinatingly demented killer and we see why he's doing what he's doing. We admire Anthony Hopkins ""Hannibal"" as a brilliant doctor who also happens to be self aware and just as evil.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The best psychological thriller ever!,"'The Silence of the Lambs' is the best psychological thriller ever made. This film has many visual moments of unmatched excellence.  The scene in Hannibal Lecter's cell when he stares at the pen with the hope of sabotaging a part from it to pick his handcuffs.  The camera pans back and fourth between it and the pen.  Brilliant.  Clarice Starling's point of view when she first lays eyes on Lecter.  The double murder of the guards in Hannibal's Memphis cell is probably the most terrifying scene ever filmed. Anthony Hopkins proves that quality and not quantity is the key to a best actor Oscar as his part is extremely small but effective.  Jodie Foster holds her own with him and you believe every second of her performance. Jonathan Demme's direction is superb and he stamps the film with a sure footed sense of style and chilling effectiveness.  And Ted Tally's adaptation of the book by Thomas Harris is entertaining from start to finish without one boring moment in the entire film.

Oh damn this movie is an all time classic masterpiece,"The Silence of the Lambs is a film that has stood the test of time as a classic in both the thriller and horror genres. Its cast, including Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter and Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling, deliver exceptional performances that have cemented their place in the history of cinema. The film is expertly directed by Jonathan Demme, who uses close-ups and leering gazes to create an intimate and uncomfortable atmosphere that puts the viewer in the shoes of the protagonist. The script and direction are efficient in moving the complex story and character arcs forward, ensuring that there are rarely dull moments. The Silence of the Lambs is a perfect example of the crossover between drama, thriller, and horror, with both the viscerally horrific scenes featuring Buffalo Bill and the psychological horror of Lecter's interrogations of Clarice being equally disturbing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I ate his liver.. with some fava beans..,"What a mesmerizing thriller! 
Anthony Hopkins gets around 16 minutes of screen time, but he delivers by creating one of the most iconic movie characters of all time. 
The movie set up is good, but nothing special. It is truly Dr Hannibal Lecter who brings this movie to the level of greatness. The dialogue is fantastic, the acting of Hopkins and Foster is excellent and the dramatic climax in Buffalo Bill's house is excellent as well. 
It is not the most though-provoking, action filled or dramatic movie, but whit it's dark understanding it is captivating and gripping and has an unsettling power.

"Six, twisted and shallow.","I gave this film a 1. It's not quite that bad, but I felt it necessary when I saw the ludicrous fact that it was ranked #20 for all time. That is as astonishing and appalling as the films five wholly undeserved major Academy Awards. To be shocking and unsettling for the purpose of art can be admirable. To be shocking and unsettling for the purpose of creating a lurid freak show is another. This movie never even makes the most cursory attempt to look at what motivates the serial killers it portrays. It just wants to be creepy. Creepy it is, and full of suspense, too. But since when does that earn you a Best Picture Oscar? ""Jurassic Park"" was creepy and full of suspense, in far skillful and artistic ways, yet the suggestion that it was award worthy would have brought guffaws.The performances of Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins are good, but definitely not Oscar worthy. In fact, for Hopkins supporting role to be included as Best Actor is abysmally ridiculous. And for all the hype that has surrounded the character of Hannibal Lecter, he is nothing but a by-the-numbers Hollywood pshycopath.In short, parts of this film are well done (others are not), and unlike most contemporary horror films it's genuinely frightening. But never for one millisecond does it begin to approach a level of depth beyond B-Grade exploitation. Well done schlock is still schlock, and when the Academy gave this film Best Picture, they damaged the dignity of an entire art form.",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Just an Overall Amazing Film,"Every time I watch this film it is an enjoyable watch. It's tense, creepy, and exceedingly well made in virtually every aspect. The performance given by Anthony Hopkins is one of the most iconic of all time. His monologues and all his dialogue are so intriguing and amazingly delivered. He was so creepy and intimidating yet admirable and intelligent in so many ways. I also enjoyed Jodie Foster and Ted Levine in this film.It's honestly quite hard to sum up this film because it really is an experience that needs to be viewed by everyone. This is a film that you need to watch in the dark with good speakers and no interruptions in order to get the full experience it deserves. Honestly, this film is practically a masterpiece and is nearly perfect. It's just very long and methodical. So it's hard to just turn it on and sit down and watch. You gotta be invested.Overall, I think The Silence of the Lambs is an amazing film. The acting, cinematography, and filmmaking are nearly perfect. This film is very deserving of its awards and should truly be viewed by everyone. There are so many creepy shots and the way the camera moves and shows everything with a purpose is just art. This film is amazing. Not necessarily horror. I'd call it a crime/drama/thriller. Don't go into it expected to be super scared. It's creepy and thrilling. Not terrifying. But it will still keep you up at night that's for sure.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
