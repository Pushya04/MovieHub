By Far the Best Scream Sequel,"Scream 2 is by far the best Scream sequel (tbh I won't argue if you say scream 4) and is a very solid entry in the slasher genre. Wes Craven was having a lot of fun with this movie and plays with the pacing and suspense at his heart's desire. The violence is amped up and we get lot of great sequences including the stage scenes, the car, and the infamous film class scene. The script delivers yet again; and the college campus setting for a slasher just works so well for me. Solid acting from Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, and Jamie Kennedy all returning for their roles. Also some familiar faces show up with lesser roles like Timothy Olyphant, Jerry O Connell, and Sarah Michelle Gellar! But at times this movie can feel more like a crime drama and I can't say it's as scary even with a more violent Ghostface. Although this movie lacks in terms of real scares, it still manages to be an above average slasher.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Still fun, but less clever than the original","How do you make a sequel to a horror film whose whole plot was made of in-jokes and film references? Easy: make the follow-up even more in-jokey and self-referential than its predecessor. This formula actually seems to work for Scream 2, at least in the first two acts.The prologue is arguably a masterclass in self-irony: an African-American couple (Omar Epps and Jada Pinkett Smith) go to a movie theater where a new horror film, called Stab, is screening. This flick is based on Gale Weathers' (Courtney Cox) book The Woodsboro Murders, which recounts the events of the first Scream. As the movie begins, Smith's character complains about Stab being a film ""with no black people in it"" (just like Scream was), and, predictably, this leads to the two African-Americans being brutally murdered as the film-within-a-film's prologue (with Heather Graham replacing Drew Barrymore) is shown on the screen, so that the fictional and real deaths occur almost simultaneously. From there on, things take the usual turn: the media go crazy about the killings and once again Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is in the spotlight, as she and her friend Randy (Jamie Kennedy) must protect themselves from the new foe, who is apparently mimicking what happened in the past (an obvious reference to the first film's ""Movies don't create psychos"" line).The main charm of the original Scream was its ability to almost seamlessly combine clever in-jokes and a believable plot. This time around, the in-jokes are the best thing in the movie, while the story, particularly in the overblown conclusion, suffers from merely repeating key scenes from the first film. Now, this might be a satire on the lack of originality in most horror sequels, and it would work if the characters were developed correctly. Sadly, such a thing doesn't happen, with Sidney being reduced to the usual girl who keeps running and screaming (fitting, huh?) and everyone else (including Liev Schreiber, who gets more screen-time in the sequel) playing stereotypes, with the exception of David Arquette, very likable as the nice cop again trying to solve the case, and Kennedy, who has a great time stating the rules to follow in a sequel.Ironically, the movie's funniest scene has a bunch of film students discussing follow-ups that are better than the originals. And while few could have anything bad to say about Aliens, Terminator 2 or The Godfather: Part II, it must be said that Scream 2, while fun and watchable, most certainly doesn't have the same sharpness that made its predecessor an above-average horror film.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A slasher sequel finally done right.,"If you thought that slasher movie sequels could be nothing more than an inferior continuation to the original and provide nothing new or innovative, ""Scream 2"" is here to prove you wrong. The entertaining characters, suspenseful directing and unique kind of meta humor that you loved from the original are back and combined with an exciting new plot, proving that even slasher movie sequels can be great as long as there's enough care and passion put into them.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A pretty good sequel,"In addition to becoming the first major box office hit for Dimension Films, 1996's SCREAM also became the horror film that would set the tone for the other horror films of the late 1990s. It was a phenomenal achievement in the horror genre so of coarse a sequel was just around the corner. The most common rule with movies is that sequels are terrible and while that is normally always true, that isn't the case with SCREAM 2. It should be noted that SCREAM 2 came out just a year after the original SCREAM. Most often when sequels come out a year after their predecessor, they turn out to be pretty bad (CHILD'S PLAY 3 for example). SCREAM 2, while not as good as SCREAM, manages to be an effective and well made sequel that surprisingly is just as clever as the first one and it contains the same kind of great dialogue the first one had as well. It helps that SCREAM 2 has most of the same cast members as the first one too. I think it's safe to say that SCREAM 2 was one of the better sequels of the 1990s. I'm giving it 7/10. Recommended for fans of horror.",,Anonymous,Horror
Pretty good sequel,"The funny thing with 'Scream 2' is that it's not as entertaining and good as 'Scream' but with bad movies like 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' and 'Urban Legend' it's kind of a relieve. Probably the difference here is that Wes Craven is  a director who knows what he is doing.Neve Campbell as Sidney, Courteney Cox as Gale Weathers, David Arquette as Deputy Dewey and Jamie Kennedy as Randy return for this sequel. New possible subjects or suspects are Cici (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Hallie (Elise Neal), Sidney's new boyfriend Derek (Jerry O'Connell), former suspect Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) who was in prison for a year, Mickey (Timothy Olyphant) and reporter Debbie Salt (Laurie Metcalf) who is a big fan of Gale.The movie opens in a theater. The movie 'Stab' is showing for the first time and this movie is based on the book 'The Woodsboro Murders' by Gale Weathers. In 'Scream' Sidney predicted that Tori Spelling would probably play her if they would ever make a movie about those events and in 'Scream 2' we learn she was right. It is one of the many funny little things. Jada Pinkett Smith and Omar Epps are killed during the showing and of course the movie is blamed.From here it is like 'Scream'. The guessing can begin. Again it is a lot of fun, again the movie knows that it must not get too serious, again I was entertained by what I saw. 'Scream' was original and therefore better, more entertaining and more surprising in the way the subject was handled. Still, with all the inside jokes and references this is a lot of fun and a lot better than almost every other movie in the genre.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Worthy Sequel,"'Scream 2' was the sequel to 'Scream', made only a year after its predecessor, it was clearly in high demand.It was a good film overall, it certainly would not be added to the long list of sequels which didn't live up to their previous films - as it is discussed IN the film. Again, the references to movie cliché's and common movie stereotypes and rules is very interesting and can be really funny as you find yourself agreeing with the characters when they discuss films. Wes Craven created a very worthy sequel, the dialogue, as with the first one, was probably the strength of the film. Neve Campbell's role was pretty much the same with no huge development in her character but she performed well and kept her acting up to the same standard as in 'Scream'. The two recurring characters who really out-did themselves in this film were Courtney Cox and David Arquette, both their characters developed substantially in this film and both actors did so very well.The script was well done but was slightly more predictable this time. When it came to who the killer eventually was, you had already worked out this because they had been absent for no apparent reason from the story for over half an hour. However, Craven did add some surprises and there were aspects of the story - both funny and scary - that you did not see coming. There was a lot more violence in this film and the body count is bigger as stated in the trailer, this film is definitely more horror than black comedy but there are some really great scenes featuring both.Overall, 'Scream 2' is not as good as the first one but it is still definitely worth a watch. Don't watch this unless you have watched the first one because you will be lost within the opening minutes of the film.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"More of the same self-relative horror, enjoyably balances mock and slasher film goods","Director Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson re-teamed for this unneeded but entertaining sequel. Also returning is a majority of the original cast (Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, David Arquette, Jamie Kennedy, and Liev Schreiber), where the story picks up two years later with Campbell attending college when a new killer dons the Ghostface mask and stalks her and her college pals. As with the first film, everyone is a suspect and most importantly the film strikes a nice tonal balance of mocking slasher film conventions while also delivering the slasher film goods. Jamie Kennedy's video store clerk, now a film school student, at one point explains the rules for horror sequels, stating ""there are certain rules that one must abide by in order to create a successful sequel. Number one: the body count is always bigger. Number two: the death scenes are always much more elaborate - more blood, more gore - *carnage candy*. And number three: never, ever, under any circumstances, assume the killer is dead."" and ""Scream 2"" delivers on all three of these points. Besides meeting those sequel requirements, Craven is a master of suspense and shock and as with the first film, for a mainstream picture, he does deliver a shockingly rough horror film. Craven actually had to submit eight different cuts to the MPAA before getting an R-rating, so there's no mistaking that this film was from the same guy who made ""The Last House on the Left"" and ""The Hills Have Eyes."" The film is also immensely helped by a strong cast of new characters that include Jada Pinkett, Omar Epps, Sarah Michelle Gellar (interestingly playing a helpless blond character-type, the antithesis of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which she was playing at this same time), Timothy Olyphant, Jerry O'Connell, Laurie Metcalf, Rebecca Gayheart, an unrecognizable Portia de Rossi, and the great David Warner in a small role as a drama teacher. Best of all are the very funny cameos for the movie-within-a-movie ""Stab,"" where Heather Graham plays the Drew Barrymore part form the first film and Tori Spelling & Luke Wilson play Campbell and Skeet Ulrich's parts (an inside joke from the first film where one of Campbell's friends asks her ""If they make a movie about you, who's gonna play you?"" and she answers, ""With my luck, they'd cast Tori Spelling.""). Look fast for a before-he-was-famous Adam Shankman as a Ghost Dancer and Selma Blair has an uncredited appearance (or is heard) as Gellar's friend on the phone. Also, the film was edited by Patrick Lussier, who'd later go on to direct the solid ""My Bloody Valentine"" remake, Nic Cage's ""Drive Angry,"" and was co-writer on under appreciated Terminator sequel ""Terminator Genisys."" My main complaint about the film is that Williamson's script hasn't aged all that well, seeming at bit too clever for itself, reminding me in many ways of the endless Tarantino wannabes of this era, where pop culture references were lazy substitutes for good dialogue, interesting characters, or original stories. Still, while this sequel basically covers the same ground of the first film, it's a strong cast with a talented director making a big budget slasher film, which is not something horror fans are treated to very often. FUN FACT! Robert Rodriguez (""Desperado"" ""Sin City"" ""Machete"") directed scenes of ""Stab"", the movie-within-a-movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Convoluted and silly,"The first Scream was a genre boosting achievement because it did away with the laborious corny crap of the 80s and went for something different and fresh, with it's much needed creativity and cleverness and the result was a mostly entertaining horror.Sadly, and I say sadly, because instead of building on its warmly accepted predecessor, Scream 2 goes back to the silly, unscary methods of the 80s and undoes all the good work done before it. Even though all the favourite characters are back, the awful dialogue and lame kills weigh the movie down terribly. Admittedly, matching or improving on the impressive original would have been a task, but Scream 2 looks like they just wanted to copy off the first and not even attempt to make anything worthy of a sequel.I might be wrong in saying this, but it really looks like a very rushed production, for whatever reason, and seeing that this was released just one year after the first, this would indeed appear to be the case. Which kind of smells like a money hungry crew wanting to further cash in financially, ignoring any notion of honouring the first movie and doing it justice.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Film Planted Firmly in Cheek,"Wes Craven is back again at the helm of Scream 2, his followup to the mega-successful Scream. As sequels go, one could do a lot worse than this film. Sure, it has a pretty silly story trying desperately to cling to the original source material, but it never ever takes the story too terribly serious. How does Craven do this? He laces the film with all kinds of film references and humour directly tied to the film industry and actors involved. Several mentions of ""Friends"" cast members abound whilst having Courtney Cox return in her signature role as Gail Weathers. Craven also brings back the rules to horror films - now horror sequels; these rules are right on mark too(wish we had heard the most important!). In fact my favourite scene in the whole movie is in a classroom where students debate the inferior sequel to the superior original. Excellent examples are given to support one argument that sequels are better: Aliens and Terminator 2, and of course, The Godfather 2. Naturally this small cross section seems great when none of the hundreds of truly bad sequels are mentioned. Purposely I am sure! Is Scream 2 better than Scream? No way. It doesn't have nearly as much punch to it. The opening scene this time takes place in a movie theater, but it is not as powerful as the opening scene with Drew Barrymore in the original. The story is really something unto itself as well...but any kind of examination of plot other than a cursory one would give too much away. Not that that would be any great pity. I did like the acting in this one more. Arquette returns as Dewey affecting some kind of limp and pinched nerve in hand. He does a fairly nice job. Cox is lovely as ever and also is good in her role. Campbell is OK, as is the rest of the cast with Jamie Kennedy again standing out as nerdy movie maven Randy Weeks and, in particular, Liev Screiber doing a wonderful job as Cotton Weary(the man who had been accused of killing Sidney's mama). This sequel has more blood, more deaths, and more jokes. Like the original, I too enjoyed this film for its entertainment value if nothing else.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very bad sequel,"Craven used to be known to make REAL horror movies. Sometimes they were experimentation horror films. But now he has fallen for Hollywood's love of cheap scares and loud, loud, loud soundtracks. This film only has one musical cue that isn't criminally loud noise. But it's music stolen from Hans Zimmer's Broken Arrow soundtrack. A soundtrack I love. This kind of made me annoyed the first, and only, time I saw this (well over 2 years ago).The photography in this film is the worst I have ever seen. Almost everything that isn't in the immediate foreground is blurred and out-of-focus. Horror films offer so many opportunities for creativity in all areas of film production. But as this film is made to appeal to mass audiences the style has to be simple. Even terrible.There is nothing worthwhile about this film and nothing to recommend. The part that I hate most seems to be what most people (for some reason) like the best. A class full of film students discusses if sequels are better than originals. That's it. You seethis IS a sequel, and they talk about sequels. Wow! So what?! That's the irony! And it's not worth a penny. I have never seen a more simpleminded and superficial so-called 'horror' film as bad as this. The fact that it thinks it's so cool just makes it worse. The true horror of this film is the horrifying ignorance to the audience.Watch Urban Legend instead if you want to watch a Campus 'who's the killer?' flick. It's junk but it's better than this.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Scream Again,"WhenKevin Williamson, the screenwriter ofScream (1996)(and Scream 2, andScream 4 (2011)), was working on the film's script, he conceived it as the first part of a trilogy. When Miramax purchased his script, they simultaneously signed a contract for two sequels. The work on Scream 2 began while Scream was still enjoying its highly successful theatrical run.Wes Cravenreturned as the director,Marco Beltrami, as the composer, and all of the surviving characters were to be played by the same actors as in the original movie.In other words, in 1997, in Los Angeles, California and in Atlanta, Georgia you could observe an unusually perfect set of circumstances. Conditions for making a sequel just do not get more auspicious - so why isn't Scream 2 a better film?The strong appeal of Scream was based on, among other factors, its skillful use of 'whodunnit' logic: we are deeply invested into finding out who the killer is, we care about the persons involved, we are trying our best to remember that anyone - save for 'final girl' Sidney Prescott - can be the culprit. With Scream 2, that approach only goes so far. We start on an uneven footing with the characters, some of whom are familiar (the principal cast ofNeve Campbell,David Arquette,Courteney Cox, andJamie Kennedy) and 'safe', while the rest are newly-introduced and comparatively less important. Who'd done it? More like, 'Who cares?'This is not to suggest that Scream 2 is without merit. Neve Campbell delivers a beautiful performance as the lead, andLiev Schreiber- now equipped with lines of dialogue! - provides the most interesting addition to the franchise. His character remains the source of ambiguity within the narrative and its otherwise clear-cut distribution of morals.Scream 2 has also been graced by the fleeting presence ofLuke Wilson(was he more or less famous thanSkeet Ulrichat the time?),Tori Spelling(was her disastrous acting intentional, provided as further satire of slasher films?),Heather Graham(lovely, but noDrew Barrymore), yet-unknownPortia de Rossi, andJada Pinkett Smith. The latter stars in the film's intro, which parallels Barrymore's involvement in the first Scream but, being narratively removed from the rest of the events, does not carry the same impact. The voiced commentary on the involvement of Black characters in horror movies remains a side note.There is less consistency and madness, so a higher body count amounts to little but figures on a blackboard, in a dark lecture theatre, where the characters should find their doom. (They do not. That is disappointing.) Where Scream succeeds in being both a collection of references and an independent story, Scream 2 goes to show that self-awareness is a poor substitute for originality.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not that original but still OK,"This second ""Scream"" isn't nearly as original as the first which was a great and suspenseful take on slasher films. This one has the high school victim in the first film - Sidney - now in college studying film. For 99% of the people who major in this, a slow descent into obscurity and realizing that your life will be spent as an admin or working retail, not as a great director, should be revenge enough for anybody. But obviously our killer(s?) is/are not that patient.The beginning is tight, at the opening of a film called ""stab"", patterned after the murders in ""Scream"", and you just know who the first two victims are going to be, although Craven's direction and the score make it a suspenseful when and where. The ending is good too, and it is different enough from the ending of the first Scream that you do wonder who is up to what, just like in the first. There are some tells though. There are some particularly - at that time - famous players in the film doing bit parts. Why? I'd say, watch and find out. Fortunately, this film was made 22 years ago so you are probably not going to know who was famous then and who is now because of subsequent events unless you are over 50.The worst part is the middle. It is tedious. You've just got some predictable chases and cat-and-mouse games going on, and you feel like it is just there to fill time between the suspenseful beginning and end. Probably worth your time if you run across it, and probably you are not going to enjoy it if you haven't seen the original Scream first.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Scream 2 yells for bigger, better and more elaborate kills but rarely receives them.","Much discussion is made in the film regarding sequels, outlining a standard set of patterns that are common in horror classics. ""Body count is always bigger"". ""Death scenes are much more elaborate"". ""Never, under any circumstances, assume the killer is dead"". For all the irony and meta dialogue that Williamson slaps onto his screenplay, Craven just doesn't deliver fully. Whether that be a loosely designed curveball to keep viewers on edge, or sheer lack of ingenuity, well that's up for debate. Alas, as good as this sequel is, it never truly exhumed the natural intelligence of its predecessor. Two years after the Woodsboro killings, a copycat killer using the same guise as ""Ghostface"" terrorises Sidney's new college.Satirising several clichés found in film sequels is a pivotal element to Williamson's screenplay. Massive discussions over infamous sequels bettering the original, outlining the tendencies found within them and comedically teasing 'Empire Strikes Back' as a planned sequel therefore being discarded from the argument. Relatable to an absurd degree. The type of conversations I have every single day. So, once again, the dialogue was punchy, extremely meta and gives the characters plenty of personality. The cast was something else too. A young Sarah Michelle Gellar and Timothy Olyphant in the same film? It's poetic! Amusingly, I screamed twice in excitement. Playful performances with an adequate amount of returning characters, raising the suspicion level to glorious heights. Craven keeps the tone light throughout, despite being a glorified slasher, retaining the refreshing aura that made the original unique. Naturally, it's not groundbreaking the second time round, but a watchable sequel nonetheless.There are, however, issues. Beltrami's score was obnoxiously overbearing, with a late inclusion of both Elfman and Zimmer. Various character themes drowned out the dialogue, particularly Dewey's, and relinquished any genuine investment towards them. The narrative shifts between Sidney Prescott and Gale ""You Just Got Weathered"" Weathers made it difficult to distinguish who the main character was and inadvertently eliminated most of the suspects from the list. Quicker than usual. The constant shifts between them, whilst balanced, threw the pacing off considerably with the second act containing zero kills. The death sequences themselves, minus the introductory scene which was excellent, were hardly memorable despite Craven trying to set up more extravagant kills. The third act and final reveal were incredibly messy (probably to do with the famous leak that happened), with seemingly most of the budget going towards that Cassandra play. Oh, and the death of a certain character did not sit well with me (and fans clearly...).Still, even with my reservations, it's a decent sequel that could've been flattened by a lack of imagination. But Craven pulls through, only just. Scream 3 will definitely need to scream harder...",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Wonderful sequel that is the perfect bedfellow for the first film.,"I'm just not buying into the bad rating for this film, in 1996 Wes Craven's Scream reinvigorated an ailing genre and got fans back into the horror groove. The love for that film, I feel, tends to skew opinions of the second instalment in what became the Scream foursome, Scream 2 seams perfectly from its starting point to up the daring ante, and plonk tongue even further into its cheek in the process.Sidney Prescott has moved on from the horrendous murders in Woodsboro and is at college getting on with her life, but the peace and hope for a bright future is quickly shattered because the Scream killer is back for more carnage...The film's opening perfectly sets out the tone for the entire picture, we see a cinema full of fake knife wielding youths dressed as the Scream killer, the film they are watching is Stab, the story of the Woodsboro murders. It's a wry commentary moment from Wes Craven, but in truth it's just one of many he makes in the film, the in jokes about sequels never gets tired, and the boo jump scare moments are all there to enjoy. Red Herrings come and go, and all the great characters who survived the first film are back again. Dewey & Gale get fleshed out a bit more, and one time caged innocent (and chief suspect) Cotton Weary is now a major character just begging us to find out if he's hero or villain.This is a sharply scripted piece of work, it knows its aims and delivers what it sets out to do, it benefits from a brilliant sound mix to emphasise the mayhem, and Craven is something of a master in racking up the tension. To laugh and be scared is the order of the day, so sit back and enjoy a film that to me proves that not all sequels suck. Oh the ending does not disappoint at all either I have to say.Scream 2 is a very worthy and enjoyable companion piece to the first film, very much so. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Clever follow-up to Wes Craven's horror franchise,"Wes Craven gained respect of horror fans with his 1996 hit slasher hit Scream, a film that reignited the slasher-horror genre with its originality and self-awareness. The following year, Craven continued the story of the masked killer with this entertaining sequel that continues the story. Neve Campbell reprises her role as Sidney Prescott who is now in college, and is dating a handsome heartthrob named Derek (played by Jerry O'Connell). Jamie Kennedy also reprises his role as Randy Meeks, the film-geek who's remained friends with Sidney after the events from the first movie. This film follows a copycat killer that is on the loose and taking the lives of others on college campus. Sidney must team up with her boyfriend Derek, and Randy, along with Gale and Dewey who also make their return from the first film, to survive against the killer's onslaught.As this film is a sequel, there are quite a bit discussions between characters about sequels and what they are all about. Like this film, these characters are very self-aware of the strategies of surviving against a killer in a horror movie, and the script makes very clear. While this one may not level up the previous film, it still remains as original and thoughtful as the previous film came out to be. It still contains the scares, suspense, and bloodshed by the Ghostface killer, and the wittiness of writer Kevin Williamson's script. It also pays a good homage to classic low-budget slasher horror films from the 80s like Splatter University, Slaughter High, and and Graduation Day. Liev Schreiber makes an interesting appearance as Cotton Weary who was the accused suspect of Sidney's mom's murder in the last, and is released from prison after proved not guilty. Neve Campbell remains good as ever as Sidney, and the rest of the cast including Jamie Kennedy, David Arquette, Courtney Cox, Jerry O'Connell, Timothy Olyphant, and Elise Neal are great as well.Could this movie have done better? Sure. But overall, this movie did not dissappoint me. This movie is one of the few horror movie sequels that manages to level relatively close with its original, and shows while Wes Craven is such an amazing horror director.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not As Amazing As The First, But Still Good.","""Scream 2"" picks up from where ""Scream"" left off, with Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), who is still dealing with memories of the murder spree that she survived in her hometown of Woodsboro during her senior year of high school. But Sidney is off to college now, and things are beginning to look up. She has a good best friend, Hallie (Elise Neal), and a love interest, Derek (Jerry O'Connell). But after a murder that occurred in a cinema (that was incidentally showing a movie based upon the murder spree that Sidney survived), the memories flood back, and another masked killer in the same attire begins to murder those around Sidney - but who is it behind the mask?A follow-up to Wes Craven's 1996 horror hit, ""Scream"", this slasher sequel is a guaranteed good time. Kevin Williamson returns to write the script for this film as well, and crafts a fairly solid story to continue the series with. The opening of this movie (the cleverly-executed cinema murder) was fabulous, and is probably the most memorable thing about this movie. There is some tongue-in-cheek humor to be found as well, but nothing over the top - this film remains fairly serious despite it's poking at the horror genre rules, which is something the original did quite well. I have to give Mr. Craven and Mr. Williamson some credit for their clever handling of these films, because they really are well-done horror movies.Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courteney Cox, and Jamie Kennedy return from the original, all giving good performances. Some new additions to the cast are Jerry O'Connell, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Sarah Michelle Gellar (who starred in ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" the same year), to name a few. The acting is on-par for the most part, and I liked the casting. The atmosphere in this film is much different than the small-town feel the original had, which I personally preferred - then again, you can't have a movie like this take place in the same town for a second time. There are plenty of surprise moments as well (and some clichéd jump-scares), but the conclusion was probably the biggest surprise of all. I never saw it coming, and I don't think most people would because the writing was so well done.Overall, ""Scream 2"" is a worthy sequel to a groundbreaking horror movie. Did I like it better than the first? No way, I prefer the original, but that doesn't mean it was bad at all. It was entertaining, spooky, and had enough twists and turns to keep nearly anyone's interest. ""Scream"" fans will be surely pleased with it. And as far as horror sequels go, this film ranks pretty high. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Scream 2 (1997),"Directed by Wes Craven.

Aside from a few tweaks, no one messed with the formula; sequel delivers pretty much exactly what one might expect, though it lacks the freshness of the original and the scares are milder. Fortunately, the satirical elements are just as keen, and thanks in part to the existence of a movie-within-the-movie (""Stab"") based on the initial killings, there's more opportunity for sneaky meta-commentary, particularly from video store geek Kennedy. Returning characters are given even greater definition here, but there are precious few standouts among the ""fresh meat"" (O'Connell's dutiful boyfriend is particularly bland).

A Classic's sequel,"Well this in a way is a typical sequel and in a way it is not. You have all the original cast here which is I must say a must in a sequel. You really shouldn't do that kind of stuff they did in for instance Chucky or so, keep the cast if the names are the same, all else is bull and most of the audience won't like it. Also don't change a good formula!!!! (this goes out to them suckers who want to make Scream 4 without the original cast (or even dare to think about it)). If you want to do it do it with them or NOT and if you do, please Neve, Courteney, David and Wes only when the script is great, no ONLY when it RULES and do not do it for money when your career is in a dip like van Damme did with Universal Sodier 2. I mean look at lousy horror sequels: Hellraiser 2 and 4, Chucky 3, Nightmare on Elm Street 5 and A new Nightmare (sorry Wes).This is I must admit not the second time I watched this one, for I was preparing to see Scream 3 really soon afterwards, so I wanted to see Scream 1 and Scream 2 before, so I could get back in to everything that happened. I already knew, of course, who the killer was and this review (as to the whodunnit) looks at the film as if I first saw it.Another good thing here is that all the cast looks grown up, I mean between Scream and Scream 2 there is only one year, but you feel as if many years have gone by (just as the story suggests).This one may be not as original as the first one, but it still is funny, exciting, surprising (you never know who is/are the killer(s)) and well acted. For the psycho killer(s) I must say he/she/they was/were great, you really believed he/she /they were totally flipped and you bought it. Neve Campbell really has grown in acting and is yet much more believable and so are David Arquette and Courteney Cox, whose characters are deepened out.NOW I want to spend a few lines on the great Neve Campbell, I thought she will be great (as in a successful actress) when I saw The Craft, Scream, Scream 2, but I must revise this now, she chooses to stay and make low budget films, that are not so heavily supported by the studios and so tend to make little money. But I must say that it is a good choice as long as the movies are as good as Wild Things or Simba's Pride.The best thing here though is the direction, Wes Craven made this one much more theatrical than the first one, and there are two scenes I LUV especially, the opening scene and the rehearsal scene. They are great and combine effects, music and events perfectly. Also there are some great spoofs. Now I bet you wonder why this does not get a 10, I presume, well I felt that some things should not have been done in the film, like that scene when Cox and Arquette go see some footage. Also I didn't like the new camera dude that much, played by Duane Martin, for I thought his 'frightened' character was too overdone. Also I found the ending not very good, it was mere average. The end of Scream was much and much better, so it come that this film does not get a 10.Still: rent, watch and enjoy8 out of 10Note: this review has been amended to remove some sexist comments I included at the time.

Who's the suspect now?,Scream 2 is the worst of the franchise but still is by no means a bad movie its main problem is it follows the first movies story a little too much making it a little to predictable with its plot and making the who done it aspect of the movie easily guessed by a casual observer other than that the movie has a great cast who are at there best in every scene and we get some interesting kills with some decent gore I'd give this movie a watch but don't expect the best Scream movie going in.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Scream 2 (8/10),"The genius of Scream 2 is the callbacks and homage it pays to former horror sequels and to the original Scream. Scream is iconic for its self-reflection, its placement in the horror genre, and the rules, which horror movies abide by. My own set of rules to a great sequel differ than the film. The rules are simple but are sadly not achieved as often as they should be. First, continuity, have a story that follows the events from the original or just limit the plot holes and have it be logical. Scream 2 passes the first rule with a big check-mark. Second, bring back major players, which Scream 2 exceeded at by starring Neve Campbell (Sidney), David Arquette (Dewey), Courteney Cox (Gale), Jamie Kennedy (Randy), and Liev Schreiber (Cotton). The third and final rule is a trickier concept to handle by filmmakers, which is maintaining the same atmosphere that made the original fantastic but to steer the story in a new direction. Wes Craven fulfilled all these rules, especially the third by preserving the character's personality, comedic moments, music theme, film style, and general mood and feeling of the film. Craven also connects the dots perfectly beginning to end on killer identity and motive and concluding with a satisfying ending. For all the reasons above, if I was in a film class and had to name a sequel that surpassed its original, one that would definitely come to mind is Scream 2.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Cool, fast and scary, but a notch down from the first","If you followed Wes Craven's ""Scream"" intently, there's no denying you'll be craving for more of the originality and unpredictability that made it such a hit. And although ""Scream 2"" is down a notch on that scale, it still hits the mark quite effectively and turns out as a fast, slick and brutal sequel that is high above your average slasher fare.Sydney(Neve Campbell, a little better acting here) is the likable, sweet heroine from the first story, in which her boyfriend and a friend were terrorizing high school students because of Sydney's dark past, which is dwelled upon in all three ""Scream"" films. She has moved on to a remote Ohio college, where she is now studying to be an actress. Paranoid and traumatized, Sydney is thrown back into the nightmare when scary murders begin plaguing the peaceful campus. One by one, her friends begin to get picked off by the angry killer in the ""ghost face"" suit that has made these movies a landmark in horror history.A bit clichéd and a bit less predictable, this ""Scream"" is still a worthy horror film and stands on its own, whereas most sequels fail miserably. David Arquette and Courteney Cox (from ""Friends"" and previous ""Scream"" fame) get thrown in the mix as well, reprising their hilarious roles and on screen romance as an ambitious cop and a bitchy reporter who survived but are stalked once more alongside Sydney.Kevin Williamson and Wes Craven conjure up another awesome scarefest and the deaths are relentless and creative up to the satisfying conclusion. As aforementioned, it's all not as tense or dark as the first. But it gets points for taking on a more serious tone and keeping the murderer well shadowed until the surprising unveiling. Good acting from the supporting cast and all around good editing make Scream 2 a hit. Great bloody and humorous fun.Unique and scary, 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Cashing On Success Of First Movie.,"Just a sequel. Watchable but not memorable. Again there is a lot of 'fake' blood. Poor dialogue. Almost no plot except for some serial killer running around some college. Watch it if your are bored, or curious after watching the first movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Zzzzzzzzzzzz...,"The saddest thing to see happen to a great movie is to see a lousy sequel. The first 'Scream' movie was great.  I loved it mostly because the whole time I was watching it I was guessing who the killer was and when I found out, I was saying, 'See, I guessed it was him near the beginning!'  But the sequel... I mean I was guessing, but there were so many to guess from it got boring.  The number of suspects went down as the body count went up.  And then when I found out who the killer was, it was someone that I didn't even care about.  My friend said to me, 'Ha, you never guessed him!'  How was I supposed to.  But this sequel just didn't do what the first one did.  It wasn't any fun to watch.  It relied too much on dead bodies and 'boo' shots to be any good. 'Boo' shots are when the killer jumps out, says 'Boo' and runs away.  I think Wes Craven should stop now before it's too late.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Self-aware cult classic is not that good in 2023,"I might be living under a rock, and not willing to dig in too deep, but I feel like Scream started as a joke and became a cult classic. Scream 2 takes it to the next level by adding self-awareness to the plot.You can't take the Scream franchise too seriously. These movies are a mix of a movie that tries to be serious and a movie that tries to be funny. In the end, Scream 2 is sort of neither of those options.The plot is alright, but, as characters quote, Scream 2 is Scream 1 with more killing, more violence. In the end, we feel we go full circle with Sidney's life.By the way, Neve Campbell, although a fine actress, I don't know --- I can't stand her glaze over everything when she is afraid.Other than that, not a good classic to recommend. Watch only if you are a die-hard movie fan.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
It's scream time,"The movie as it is, is pretty decent. I might have given it only a 6/10 (which is also good), but there is one moment in here, that really shocked me. Something that I guess people who have seen the original (and I am assuming you have in my review), will not see coming (unless they have read about it or someone told them).We have the survivors back and we also have the winning team back from part 1. Craven and Williamson do a pretty good job to continue the story (while not being as sharp as in the first one). While the first one ended with a pretty great climax (so simple and yet so genius), this one cannot top that. But it doesn't have to top it (especially with the great moment happening prior to that), it just has to entertain us. And that it does ...",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good but not like the first,"I liked the film and it had some good scenes but ultimately didn't live up to the first film that set a bar. Had some good characters particularly Gail Weathers and Randy, it was kind of 90s goofy when you rewatch it but I liked it non the less.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Still the Best Scream Sequel,"Scream 2 is the Best Sequel of the franchise the new one is weak and disappointing compared to this one. The Filmmakers made everything right with this one. Scream 2 has a good pacing a great Opening Scene in the Cinema (which is something new in a Horror-Teen Slasher) The Characters are well written and there is lot of suspense,and the soundtrack is terrific and the 90s Vibe is so cool and It give us the same thrills from the First one. Scream 2 is a very strong and satisfying sequel, sadly they never made a really good Scream Film after this one, part 3, 4 and 5 was just above-average to mediocre.I miss the 90s.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Incredibly surpassing sequel,"After the Scream phenomenon, it was only natural that a sequel was in the works. While most slasher sequels tend to be a let down and not live up to their first by having a ridiculous premise or not having the needed characters, Scream 2 is entirely different. This sequel was excellent, and lived up to the first Scream perfectly, when I did not think it would on first viewing. I mean, I was expecting it to be good, but not as good as it was. It's premise was wonderful, and the characters are amazing, because it has all the characters, that aren't already victims, from the first and more that are just as fun. All in all, it was a joyous outcome.Scream 2 is not afraid to kill off whoever it wants to, like the one before and after it, even though that one does not have as many fans as the first two. It has some new twists, and the execution style is just as professional and cunning as the first. It keeps you totally entertained and the performances are just as fun. While of course it is not as good as the original, it is pretty close, I must say, and that of course is an accomplishment in itself.After the events of Woodsboro, California, Sidney and Randy soon realize that a killer is on the loose again, this time at the college they are attending in Ohio. Dewey arrives on the campus to once again protect Sidney, and she and Dewey have an unwelcome reunion with Gale. How pleasant, we have all our old friends back, and the cast pulls out all the stops with their characters like they did in the first. It's still gritty and bloody, and it's also loaded with lots of nice material matter. I do not understand why it is not as appreciated as it is, regarding the rating mostly. Scream fans and horror lovers were all pleased with this movie when it came out, so I have heard, and I was as well.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"It Wasn't Horrible, It Has It's Moment, But For The Most Part Scream 2 Is Just An Underwhelming Sequel","Scream 2 opens with another good terrifying opening sequence take place in the movie theater, and after that Scream 2 wasn't a horrible movie, it has it's moments, but for the most part underwhelming, the story wasn't as engaging as the previous one, it didn't have to be 2 hours, there is more cheesy moment, though it did kept me guessing throughout the film until the very last, once it reveal i ain't gonna lie to you even though i did not see it coming, it's not really that shocking and i don't think it deliveredly continue that well, but at least i still can't guess it and i'm still into it for that, that's probably the most positive thing about Scream 2, Neve Campbell and the rest of the returning cast was ok, not really buying David Arquette that much in this one though he's not terrible, again it still have it's moment, a moment where they get me scared more than the previous one, there isn't much of a stupidness in it, overall like i mention in the beginning, it wasn't horrible, it has it's moment, but for the most part Scream 2 is just an underwhelming sequel.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Don't Watch w/o Seeing ""Scream"" First","""Scream"" reinvigorated the slasher movie, a narrow genre to begin with, and one that I thought exhausted.  It's sequel, ""Scream 2"" is very similar to its predecessor in substance and style. Strong character development, clever dialogue, large dollops of humor, and of course lots of scares marks this as way above average. Unfortunately, ""Scream 2"" has two significant difficulties for viewers. One is that it's almost a mirror image of ""Scream"". Instead of high school, it's set at a college, but the characters, and set-ups are almost identical. You don't have to see both movies, one is enough. The second problem is that if you haven't seen ""Scream"", ""Scream 2"" won't make a lot of sense. The plot follows the survivors of ""Scream"" to college, where, of course, the carnage begins anew. There are tons of backwards references that don't stand-alone very well, and as for the who-dunnit aspects of the movie's conclusion, knowledge of the original ""Scream"" is an absolute necessity.  Therefore, only rent ""Scream 2"" if you've also seen ""Scream"" and want more of the same. It's exactly what you'll get.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Only underwhelming because it's not up to the standard of the first,"I'm convinced the biggest problem with Scream 2 is that it is a Scream movie. Don't get me wrong, it would never work without having the connection to the original film. There are so many plot points tied to that movie, and the entire meta commentary of the movie is about horror movie sequels. However, it simply can't measure up to the brilliance of that story. There are good moments in this story, though, and it still works as a murder mystery which is my favorite element of the Scream films. They aren't traditional slasher stories, but they are straight up whodunits. Even though I had seen the movie once in the theater, I didn't remember it well on this rewatch, so the ending still had some surprises. It was a little cheesy and the performances in the climax were over-the-top to an extreme, but at least I could enjoy the twist again.The story in this one doesn't move as smoothly as it did in the first film, and I can feel some of the clunky parts. Also, one of my favorite aspects of Scream is how they genuinely cast suspicion on multiple people and they all feel like real possibilities until they wind up dead. But in Scream 2 the red herrings are fairly obvious and never strike me as actual suspects. I'll also mention that I can't stand the fact that one of the returning characters winds up dead. Pretty much any other person that returned could have gone and I would have tolerated it, but I liked that one person and what they added to the films. The kills in this movie are a tad underwhelming, particularly since they implied the kills needed to be more elaborate and bloody. All of this sounds like I was really down on Scream 2, but I actually enjoyed it to some degree and find it better than most other slasher films. It just can't meet the standard set by its predecessor, no matter how hard it tries.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than the original,"Dare me to say it? ...THIS MOVIE WAS BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL!Ha! There goes my ""useful comment"" rating!Not many movies beat their originals, especially in the horror genre. However, Scream 2 proved them wrong.Sidney has gone to college and moved on with her life after the events of Scream. However, the murders and famous ""ghostface killer"" have followed too.Sidney, Dewey, Gale, Randy, and Cotton all return from the first film. But we also get an interesting new group of people: Hallie, Derek, Mickey, Cici, and Debbie the reporter, who is actually more annoying than Gale.We also have a higher body count, more gore, more interesting kills, and a much better ending (in my opinion).I recommend this to fans of the original movie. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A good sequel.,This movie was good but I don't think it was as good as the first one. The creepy atmosphere is lost in this one. Though the acting is pretty good and there are some pretty intense moments.This movie follows Sidney Prescott two years after the she escapes the murderous boyfriend in the first one. Someone has dawned the ghost face costume and is trying to copycat the killers murders. Sidney is once again the main target of the ghost face fury.This movie was not bad at all.

Flawles but yet enjoyable horror slasher sequel flick,"Scream 2 is flawless but enjoyable sequel it is not better than the first one but much way better than part 4. Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson does return for this sequel but still I enjoy the third one much way more. The second sequel was good little different mixed with action and humor, but it wasn't that scary to me. It is really a step down from the first film. I have a lot of problems with this film.The bad: The writer Kevin Williamson copied the first film why would they copy the first film? I don't get it. The film looks like the same as the first movie, first the name of the town was Windsor like in the first movie Woodsboro: Then the victims were killed whit the same names and surnames the same emo from the first killer. Than was a copy killer on the loose and than they were like two killers just one wants to get away, the other wants to get caught. Deputy Sheriff David Arquette as Dewey Riley did do nothing in this movie and he was useless in this film! He was complaining, yelling and did do nothing, he was slashed but yet again he survived, how did he survive? or why is he in this movie is yet beyond me. Kevin Williamson wrote his character dull and awful. Marco Beltrami copied and stole the theme music score from Hans Zimmer music score for Broken Arrow (1996) John Woo film. The humor I didn't like in here and I didn't like they were talking about Stab fictional movie in this film that was based on Scream film. Jada Pinkett Smith was in the beginning in this film and she was terrible. Most of the characters in this film are awful.The good: I love the ghostface killer in this movie and he doesn't use so much scary movies questions like in the first movie, he simply kills fast his victims. I love Neve Campbell as Sidney Prescott she was lovely, such a sole survivor, such a bad-ass even more sexy than in the first film. Her ass was sexy, man o man she was hot! I fall in love with her, I did enjoy her performance as Sidney. I enjoy Courteney Cox as Gale Weathers this time she had a different hair cut but she was still good in her performance as a nosy tabloid reporter. The most hero I enjoy in this movie is Liev Schreiber as Cotton Weary he is awesome!!! A true real hero he is excellent! I really did enjoy the plot twist and his character. Sarah Michelle Gellar as Casey ""Cici"" Cooper is in here she is really good and Timothy Olyphant as Mickey from Live Free or Die Hard is in here! The cast work really well.8/10 It is a good slasher horror movie and a good sequel to the first one I still watch this films, I like this film and the trilogy. I like the song ""She Said by Collective Soul excellent song. My third favorite film in the series but still a good one, doesn't deserve the hate.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

The follow-up to the sleeper hit Scream continues the satire lampooning the tropes of slasher sequels,"Some time after the events of the Woodsboro Massacre, survivors Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) and Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy) are now attending Windsor College right as a new slasher film Stab based on Gale Weathers' (Courtney Cox) book ""The Woodsboro Murders"" is hitting cinemas. With the release of the film the murders soon begin again following the murder of two Windsor students at preview screening of Stab with the realization that a copycat killer is staging a follow-up to the Woodsboro Massacre.Following the success of the first Scream, Miramax, director Wes Craven, and writer Kevin Williamson moved ahead on a sequel based on the outlines Williamson had submitted along with the first Scream screenplay. The movie was filmed on a very rushed six month production schedule (albeit given a budget $10 million higher than its predecessor) with the tight shoot further complicated when a draft of the script was leaked onto the internet revealing the killer's identity and much of the intended plot. As a result rewrites were undertaken while the film was shooting with script pages often finished and delivered on the day of shooting. Upon it's release one year after the first film, Scream 2 experienced the same critical success as the first one (with several critics claiming it to be better than the original) and the film saw a rise in box office gross as well making $170 million worldwide against a $24 million budget with $100 million of the gross coming from the United States alone. Scream 2 does a good job of continuing the themes and ideas present in the original even if the sequel doesn't quite pack the same punch in my opinion.The movie does solid work bringing back the surviving characters from the original with Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, David Arquette, and Jamie Kennedy still good in their respective roles with a good sense of growth and development from their experience in the prior film carried over. The movie also features some new characters of varying degrees of quality with Live Schrieber's Cotton Weary given great expansion on his unspoken appearance in the first film as the man wrongfully imprisoned for the murder of Sidney's mother who has now become a colleague of Gale's and made lucrative deals on the media circuit. We also get a number of other new characters such as Jerry O'Connell's Derek (sidney's new boyfriend) or Timothy Olyphant's Mickey and while we have more characters to fill out the body count, they're not as memorable as the original line-up with fewer scenes dedicated to establishing their characters. They're all played just fine as you can tell from the actors involved, but the scenes of them having conversations about the tropes and conventions of the genre seem slightly more downplayed this time around which you could argue is the point since that's often a direction slasher franchises take to get to what sells the film to their audience, but while the mixture of satire and horror is still there it's not as balanced as it was previously. I think this brings us to a major crack in the film's foundation with how the film handles the character of Randy Meeks, and without going into spoilers how they deal with that character is a decision that I personally feel dealt a significant blow to this series which would carry over to Scream 3 (though there were other factors at play there) and with how the movie handles that character it feels like it loses a core element of its satirical edge.Scream 2 delivers on the same strengths as its predecessor with a nice mixture of humor and horror and the way the film embraces and pokes fun at the conventions of slasher sequels is mostly successful even if certain decisions don't quite land with the same impact we saw in the first film. But despite not escaping its predecessor's shadow it comes pretty close to meeting the same level.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A strong, knowing sequel","Wes Craven is of course a legend to horror fans for his work on films like Nightmare on Elm Street and The Hills Have Eyes. He was the perfect man to make Scream, a post modern homage and comedy of slasher films but also a good slasher on its own. Writer Kevin Williamson originally wanted to make Scream a trilogy, so getting Wes Craven was a sensible decision to keep the series going.A year after the events of Scream a film has been about it, ""Stab"". During a preview screening two university students (Omar Epps and Jada Pinkett) are murdered in a crowded cinema. The media descend on the university which the hero from the first film, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is studying at. And it all seem like it was going well for Sidney who seem to get her life back on track. But the survivors of the first film become the targets of the new ghost face killer as the body court starts to raise.Like the first film there is sharp dialogue throughout, there is insight about horror genre and theories about whether violence in film influence violence in real life (I personally think that rubbish because if you got violence tendencies you don't need a film to influence you) and it both a commentary on the genre and social attitudes. Even if Scream and Scream 2 were made as straight forward slasher films they would seen be better then most because the character are more likable and believable then in most slashers, making you care for characters if something happens to them. I also really like Craven's way of shooting chases with the way the camera follows the action of someone being chased in a easy to follow yet tense way. Paul Greengrass should take note that a scene can be tense without the need of shaky cam preventing the audience working out what's happening.The acting is decent enough. Courtney Cox's character Gail Weathers grows to be a little more softer and likable with more tender scenes. Campbell is very solid as the lead, forced back into a situation she thought she would never face again. But after going through all this twice I would have thought she would be psychological scarred for life. Elise Neal and Pinkett basically play typical sassy black women, especially Pinkett who is also a woman with an axe to grind about women's and African American's rights. Jerry O'Connell who plays Sidney's boyfriend is made out to be a decent bloke if a bit of a preppy. I personally thought that Liev Schreiber was a bit of a weak link because I really did not buy into performance and his looked like he was on autopilot.Scream 2 is also filled with subplots, one of them being the three other survivors believing one of them is the killer and they go on the search to find out who it really is and one able Cotton (Schreiber) wanting to get Sidney to agree to an interview about how her evidence got him arrested for her mother's murder and so he could put his side of the story out to the media. There were well handled and did not distract from main plot which a fast paced affair. The scene on the university court yard was an additional tense when characters try and find Ghostface.The film starts off being very similar to the first film, a 10 minute prologue, the police and media going crazy, the debate of film and Sidney punching Gail, it is still different from the first and not just a repeat of Scream. For the most part Scream 2 still plays on horror clichés like two characters arguing a case about whether to run or check to see if the killer is dead and have a valid argument. But sometimes Scream 2 does fall into the cliché trap like a cop having a chance to kill Ghostface or the characters splitting up when Ghostface is around. But it still a strong, entertaining knowing horror film.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than the first!,"I really enjoyed SCREAM because I thought it was a very original horror movie. I liked SCREAM 2 for the same reason. The story line is pretty much the same as in SCREAM, but I thought the acting, characters, and death scenes were all better.Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) has gone off to college to become and actress. Now that she has left her past behind her, she is doing better. She has a new best friend/roommate named Hallie (Elise Neal), a new boyfriend and a new life. But when somebody starts killing people in the same style of the killer, Sidney finds out that her past has come back to haunt her. Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber), old prime suspect proven innocent of the murder of Sidney's mom from SCREAM, returns to try and get publicity for his part in all of this. Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy) returns as the movie expert and Dewey Riley (David Arquette) and Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox) return to try and protect Sidney.The plot is pretty much the same as SCREAM, but instead of poking fun of horror movies, they poke fun at sequels. When the college students argue about whether sequels can be better than the original, it's priceless.The acting is even better in this movie than in SCREAM. Neve Campbell does her usual teriffic job. David Arquette and Courtney Cox are even better in SCREAM 2 than they are in SCREAM. Sarah Michelle Gellar and Jada Pinkett are the equivilant of Drew Barrymore in SCREAM. They both do fair jobs, especially Sarah. Liev Schreiber and Jamie Kennedy do great jobs, and Roger L. Jackson returns at the bitchin' phone voice. (By the way, in a movie full of the biggest teenage stars of today, Joshua Jackson has a good cameo.)The character development is even better in SCREAM. You will, once again, find yourself screaming at the characters to run and get away. Sidney and Gale are just as cool as they were in the first one. Dewey and Randy are both extremely better characters in this one than in SCREAM. In SCREAM, Randy was annoying and an almost pointless character. In SCREAM 2, he's my favorite. The addition of Cotton Weary in this movie is suberb.I thought SCREAM 2 was better than SCREAM. Most people will think it is just as good or almost as good as SCREAM. If you didn't like SCREAM, don't bother watching SCREAM 2. But if you, like me, enjoyed SCREAM, this is a must-see.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

A more than worthy sequel,"I really enjoyed this movie. It's fun, funny, suspenseful and awesome all at once. It once again has a great musical score with some returning themes. There are a bunch of great new additions to the cast, especially Timothy Olyphant and Liev Schreiber (who had a tiny role in the original). They manage to come up with another intriguing story that builds on the lore of the original and is definitely unpredictable.I once again love the discussions about movies, with some of the discussion outside of the horror genre. It feels just like the original, which is a huge compliment. It's not as good as the OG, but it's a more than worthy sequel. (about 4 viewings, 3/15/2021, 1/9/2022, 3/4/2023)",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

It does the job but is a bit underwhelming,"Scream 2 is definitely an enjoyable sequel and there's lots of fun to be had here, however I was left slightly disappointed.My big frustration with this film is that I think there was a better and more imaginative story to tell, but they missed the mark. This is essentially just a run through of the greatest hits from the first movie. There's little that's new here to enjoy.The final reveal wasn't as satisfying or fun as in the first film, and it was glaringly obvious who the killer was from very early on.It does have its moments though. The meta references, such as students discussing how sequels suck in their film class (unfortunate foreshadowing?), were brilliant, more of that would have been nice. The chase scenes and murders were well done, but very similar to the first film.Everything about this is fine. They haven't let the franchise down with this entry in the slightest. It's still fun, still entertaining, still relatively scary. But it pales in comparison to the original.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Does Better Than Most Horror Sequels Tend To,"Lacking the freshness of the original but still retaining its gleeful thrills & sharp satire, Scream 2 features most of the ingredients that made its predecessor an instant classic while packing few surprises of its own to deliver as a worthy follow-up, if not a better one. Parodying & embracing all the genre elements like before while also serving as a fascinating takedown on the clichés of film sequels, it is a welcome addition to the saga.Directed by Wes Craven (A Nightmare on Elm Street & Scream), the story continues the journey of the Woodsboro massacre survivors and opens with an impressive prologue that sets the plot into motion. However, it fails to replicate the tight narrative structure & cinematic ingenuity that the first film had and also feels rushed in its handling of both reprising & new characters, which in turn makes its finale not as rewarding as the last time.Compared to the first film, this one has a slightly more campy tone to it and character interplay is also missing that gripping flair. Nevertheless, the interest in the proceedings isn't lost, for the violent killings keep surfacing regularly. Performances from the returning cast is solid as before but their roles needed more fine tuning. And while there are hints of brilliance scattered all over the picture, they hardly come together to form a unified whole.Overall, Scream 2 is a competently crafted & consistently thrilling sequel that does better than most horror sequels tend to and is going to leave most viewers amused & entertained, if not as dazzled & delighted as before. The film may not match the creative quality of the original but it does many things right, packs more savage kills & body counts, and makes for a fun, incisive & enjoyable slasher that delivers the goods in sufficiently satisfying doses.",,Anonymous,Horror
Sequel references gives franchise some new life,"Two years after the first movie. Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) has written a book about the murders and it's been popularized in the movie Stab. A new Ghostface rises up to start killing again at a showing of Stab. Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) is out of prison with the help of Gale. Gale is too happy to soak up all the publicity. Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) and Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy) are students at Windsor College. Derek (Jerry O'Connell) is Sidney's new boyfriend. Dewey Riley (David Arquette) comes out to protect Sidney. There is a whole new cast of characters ready for the killing and ready to be suspects.Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson have return to the self-referencing franchise. Being a sequel, there are a lot of referencing to sequels and what that usually entails. It gives the franchise a new reason to continue. The returning cast is a capable crew. I do have a minor problem with the new additions. They all end up as either cannon fodder or the killers. It would be much more surprising if one of the new people survives.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A good sequel which parodies sequels,"To be honest, let me say first that though Scream 2 is a common sequel, I like it because it makes fun of itself. Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson bring in some new characters like Sidney's new boyfriend Derek Feldman (well played by Jerry O'Connell) but also some already known characters get a bigger part this time. The best example is Cotton Weary (very believable played by Liev Schreiber), but also Randy Meeks (again cool performance of Jamie Kennedy) can be seen again.Of course there some other new characters too but the you will soon recognize that the focus lies on Sidney, Dewey and Gale (Neve Campell, David Arquette and Courtney Cox).I don't think it makes any sense watching it without having seen the first part cause there are many references to it.In the very beginning of the movie Wes Craven also makes fun of or rather accuses the behaviour of the fans of splatter-movies. They are personated as violence-seeking almost mad crowd who can't wait to see some people getting slaughtered. A very shocking way how they are presented and it may be exaggerated but not that unrealistic. It makes you thoughtfully, but of course you don't have to deal with it and an also just enjoy the movie.My résumé is that if you like Scream you'll also like this one, although the only thing that has been approved is the hairstyle of Courtney Cox.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
A sequel that lives up to the original,"I have always loved scream and believe that it is one of the greatest movies i will watch for a while.Scream 2 is another death in the beginning and guess throughout, while others have died there are more people around Sidney this time which leaves even more suspects for Sid and us to suspect and wonder just how save she really is.I found the acting on this one to be well above average and i can't really fault anyone's acting and i have to admit that i really do like Sarah Michelle gellar and i found her to be an amazing little actress in this one as well.The plot hasn't run thin even though there isn't the largest revelations in the world, there certainly is a few twists which result in one hell of a movie somehow linking itself to the first scream ever so well without just delving into the roots to make a stupid cop-out sequel just for money.The death scenes aren't the largest amount of blood you will ever see but it does have more than the first one so you have been warned, of course this film tries to pull on heart strings so depending on who you take a liking to you might just find yourself upset with the result of your favourite cause i know i was.Overall, this film is a great sequel that can't be ignored so ignore the low star rating, watch it yourself and i'm sure you'll find yourself pleasantly surprised that you have.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great Sequel,"Two years after the first series of murders, a new psychopath dons the Ghostface costume and a new string of killings begins.This is one of those rare sequels that has just as strong a plot and writing as the original. Sure, in some ways it may not be as great (can you ever beat the first installment?) but its inclusion of ""sequel rules"" and the introduction of the ""Stab"" franchise? Quite clever.We also get a dramatic increase in star names, which is really saying something with the list of big names in the first. Some are not so great... you know, Jerry O'Connell has never had a good role. Ever. But on the flip side, Luke Wilson nails it in his cameo.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Not as good as the first, but worthy","The original Scream was a classic, so this sequel had a lot to live up to. And it was a worthy sequel on the most part. Though it didn't entirely succeed, the story is less fresh and less original, it is not as efficiently paced and the killer's reveal was predictable. However, the production values are of high quality, the music is still haunting and the sound still unsettling, there are still the funny lines, the genuine scares, the credible direction from Wes Craven and the return of the iconic GhostFace. The acting is still good too. So overall, a worthy sequel, just not quite the instant classic the first was. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Another Teen Slasher Movie, it's ok.","I'm not a fan of the teen-slasher genre, or horror in it's entirety for that matter, that's probably why it's taken me nearly 5 years to finally sit down and watch this sequel.I have to admit that I wasn't really a huge fan of the original ""Scream"", well, it was ok, but I didn't think it was anything great.  So, I had pretty low expectations of this film and on top of that, I've had a number of friends say that this is the worst in the series.  Needless to say, my expectations had hit rock-bottom!After seeing the film, I must say that I thought it was pretty good.  I don't know where I'd put this film compared to the first one, probably about the same likability for me.  I thought this film had a lot of good things going for it, I thought the story was pretty good and really kept you guessing.  I also REALLY liked the comedy in this film, David Arquette and Jamie Kennedy crack me up!  The only major complaint I have about this film is that they killed my favorite character in the series!  I won't give it away for those of you that haven't seen it, but the choices are pretty limited, there were only 5 or so actors that were in both ""Scream"" and ""Scream 2"" (and only one of them dies in part 2, so when you see the film you'll know who I'm talking about).The acting was pretty good in this film, I really enjoyed the cast in this film.  There were a lot of familiar faces and a lot of cameos: Tori Spelling, Heather Graham, Sarah Michelle Gellar, David Warner, Wes Craven, Joshua Jackson, Portia de Rossi, Omar Epps, and perhaps some others that I missed.  The core cast was really good as well: Courteney Cox, David Arquette, Neve Campbell, Jerry O'Connell, Liev Schreiber and everyone else. Great cast!I guess if you're into teen-slasher films and liked the first ""Scream"" film, then you should definitely check this out.  I can't promise you'll like it as much as the first film, as most of my friends didn't, but you never know. Well, if you do see the film, I hope you enjoy it.

"""Scream 2"" overcomes some obstacles to end up a respectable sequel and counterpart.","Wes Craven's ""Scream"" was such a smashing success that a sequel was quickly rushed into production, and in 1997, ""Scream 2"" was born. Re-uniting Craven and screenwriter Kevin Williamson, the film also saw the return of its surviving stars as well as the now-iconic Ghostface killer, who, for obvious reasons, carries an alternate identity than that of the killer(s) in the first film. Stalking Sidney and her friends at college, the film centers around the damaged character and the paranoia that continues to cripple her life. As Deputy Dewey puts it: ""You probably already know him...or her...or them. They're probably already in your life. They get off on that.""The film can't help but feel redundant when compared to its predecessor, especially when it comes to its surprise finish. That's not to say the film is a complete re-hash though. Thankfully, it still puts your expectations through the loops and keeps you on the edge of your seat with some nail-biting suspense and gruesome blood-shed. In fact, when you compare it to other like-minded films of the time (see: ""Scream"" rip-offs), it's downright nasty and fun at the same time! The college campus setting also helps change things up a bit, and with so many horror sequels ripe for the picking, ""Scream 2"" is to horror sequels what ""Scream"" was to horror movies in general. It ups the ante, raises your expectations and (for the most part) meets them.The direction by Craven seems a little more confident this go-round, which is unfortunate since Williamson's script gives its characters clunky and awkward dialogue to spit, which severely drags down the film. The first one was whip-smart, but this one's a little milder. The tone of the flick and the overall plot is just-right; it's in the little things that bog the flick down. Even still, its flaws are minor, and it's got another great, talented cast, some of whom meet unfortunate and grisly demises. Keep an eye out for wacky Aunt Jackie from ""Roseanne"" herself, Laurie Metcalf, in a seemingly minor but memorable role.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Scream 2 had to be one of the most anticipated films of 1997. And when it was finally released, you weren't disappointed.","Picking up two years after the original, we find young Sydney in college, with her friend Randy (Jamie Kennedy, the horror movie buff) and some new friends she's picked up along the way (including Jerry O'Connell as her new boyfriend). Reporter Gail Weathers (Courtney Cox) is also back. Seems she's written a book about Sydney and her life, and it's been turned into a movie called Stab! At the premiere of Stab! a couple of people are killed, and everyone thinks its all starting over again. To the aid of young Sydney comes Dewey (David Arquette) who has seen better days. Soon people all over campus are being killed by someone in a Scream mask. Who is it this time? Everyone's a suspect, and everyone seems to have a motive. The only real difference between Scream 2 and the original is now you're sort of ready for the twists and turns. Director Wes Craven and screenwriter Kevin Williamson still serve up horror clichés, then shoot them down, but it's not as unexpected as before. But that doesn't mean the movie isn't as fun as the first. You still can't guess who the killer is until they decide to tell you (although I was a little disappointed in the ending). And the movie does slow down a little in the middle. Just before sitting down to watch Scream 2 I watched a copy of the original that had Craven and Williamson talking about the movie as it was happening. They mentioned that one of the producers told them they needed to kill someone off in the middle (turned out to be the principal) because you couldn't have a horror film where no one died for half an hour, and I wish they had done something like that here. The movie is still filled with pop-culture references (how many movies can mention Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon and the fact that The Empire Strikes back wasn't a sequel but a continuation of a trilogy?)The main reason the original was fun was because it didn't assume that the audience is stupid, and just want a lot of blood and guts. Williamson knows that today's horror fans are more sophisticated, and expect a movie that makes sense. I enjoyed the movie a lot, and probably will go see it again. In the movie Randy at one point said, sequels suck. With this one, he was wrong. Here's looking to Scream 3.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Wes Craven does it again,"The Plot line = 2 years after the horrific events in Woodsbrough Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) attempts to try and move on with her life by attending college along with fellow survivor Randy (Jamie Kennedy) but yet again there's another killer whose after Sidney's blood, after two college students are murdered while attending the premiere of ""Stab"" which is based on the events of the first movie and after that Sidney starts experiencing deja vu when the killer starts stalking her and taunting and as the body count begins to get higher and higher Sidney realises she's next can she survive again or will she end up dead.Scream 2 is everything a sequel should be more gore and a higher body count and plus yet again a long list of suspects. To be honest this was one the sequels I was looking forward too and gladly it didn't disappoint me. It still managed to keep the intensity and humour the first one did, the first Scream was like a tribute to 80's slashers and was quite frankly much better than them all and Scream 2 is a tribute to the 80's college slashers and again better than all of them put together.The characters themselves really made the movie as well the ones who came back are the lovely level headed Sidney (Neve Campbell) back, my fave Randy (Jamie Kennedy) the horror movie film buff who sadly doesn't get enough screen time, Dewey (David Arguette) the lovable silly policeman and the bitchy but sexy Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) who all come back but will they survive this time. We also get a host of new characters such as Dereck (Jerry O' Connell) Sidney's new boyfriend and possible suspect remember the first one could history be repeating itself, Mickey (Timothy Olyphant) the freaky Tarantino film student, Hallie (Elise Neal) Sidney's roommate and new best friend, Cotton Weary (Liev Shreiber) who appeared briefly in part one who got accused of killing Sidney's mother but was wrongly accused and could may well be out for revenge and lets not forget fellow scream queen Buffy er no sorry I meant Sarah Michelle Gellar looking gorgeous as ever in her few short lived minutes as one of the victims.The kills in this movie are cool, the suspense is there We also get lots of cameos (you spot them), a great phone conversation between Randy (Kennedy) and the killer and even a few nods Friday The 13th's way. But overall, this sequel rocks.The acting Neve Campbell is brill as always, David Arquette is lovable, Jamie Kennedy didn't get enough screen time, Courteney Cox is even sexier and bitchier in this one and gets yet another slap from Sidney. Jerry O' Connell did fine although a bit dull but still likable, Timothy Olyphant has great hair and has fun, Elise Neal was OK but not very interesting, Liev Shreiber to be honest I found that there was really no need to fetch his character back because he didn't bring anything new or exciting to the movie, Sarah Michelle Gellar is stunning as always, Laurie Metcalf truly shines although not until towards the end, Jada Pinkett well I was surprised to see her in this but does fine as one of the first victims and Omar Epps is cool but gets killed way too fast.All in all Craven does well again, injecting the suspense scenes with lots of tension, the film is definitely a worthy follow up and well and truly has it's moments and also I loved the cheesy twist ending.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

A horror sequel that lives up to the original,"Two years have passed since the events in 'Scream' and a film, titled 'Stab', which recounts those events has been released. Two people are murdered at a screening in the town of Windsor... perhaps it is no coincidence that Sidney Prescott, the young woman at the centre of the first film is now attending Windsor College. Inevitably the media, including Gale Weathers, descend on the town and Sidney finds herself the centre of attention again. Also arriving in Windsor are Deputy Dwight ""Dewey"" Riley and Cotton Weary, a man who'd spent a year in jail after Sidney's accusation that he'd killed her mother. Once again a killer wearing the distinctive 'Ghostface' mask starts killing people close to Sidney. As the death toll mounts the finger of suspicion points at various people; including Cotton and Sydney's new boyfriend.In the first 'Scream' film much was made of the killers following genre rules. This is followed up with discussions of rules for sequels and arguments over whether a sequel can ever match the original... I think this one might even if it inevitably lacks the original's shocking opening. Instead we get the most self-referential opening I can think of with characters watching a shot-for-shot remake of the original, with different cast obviously... this turned out to be a great hook as it reminded the viewer of that film and them propelled them into the sequel. As one would expect there are plenty of fairly gruesome deaths and lots of tension. The central cast are solid; most notably Neve Campbell and Courteney Cox who are great as Sidney and Gale. The identity of the killer isn't too obvious; I'll admit I was convinced it was somebody who turned out to be innocent. Overall I'd say that if you enjoyed the original you should check this out as it is as good and has plenty to add to the story; if you've yet to watch the original you should definitely watch it first.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Wes Craven returns to ""attack"" the clichés of teen and horror films, but this time more gently, giving the film an apparently more serious focus. Nevertheless, and despite the film really looks serious and keen to cause fear, its too funny for it and the victims are still too despicable for us to have empathy for them. Only Sidney (Neve Campbell) deserves sympathy, as seems to be the character psychologically more complex and mature.

Sidney's friends are being picked-off one-by-one and she in a fight for life.For me, Scream 2 isn't as good as Scream, but for a film that was rushed into production and had the difficult task of following a modern horror phenomenon, it's really a decent film. I'll give a lot of the credit to the director, Wes Craven, and a talented group of actors. Craven was a real pro. The fact that he was able to take this bloated script and turn it into something watchable is almost a miracle. He does an excellent job creating tension and atmosphere with several of the kills. I'm probably most impressed with Randy's death scene given that it takes place in broad daylight in a crowded common area. Nicely done. As for the acting, it's a strong cast for a film like this. Campbell is joined by actors like Liev Schreiber, Timothy Olyphant, Jamie Kennedy, Courteney Cox, Jerry O'Connell, and Laurie Metcalf - all more than capable. Very nice. You know, if it weren't for an overload of self-referential nonsense, a 2+ hour runtime in desperate need of editing, and the ridiculous opening movie theater sequence, I could easily see rating Scream 2 much higher.

A lifeless corpse of a hardly breathing franchise,"Though the film isn't dull in EVERY aspect, Scream 2 feels like the stereotypical horror sequel cash grab it knows it is, only at times worse. By being self aware, many believe the Scream franchise to be a smart retelling of what would happen in real life, but really, as smart as this concept could be, it seems held back by its own hypocritical antics, and this film is especially no exception. Filled with stereotypes and cliches galore, the film feels like one eye roll after another, and eventually you just give up on believing it will truly make any impact, or for that matter, any sense at all. The actors give it their best shot, but with a screenplay that seems to stubborn to life the veil on what it could be, it hardly gives them any grace for it. The film is shot well, but as obvious as it is, looking good and being good are two very different things, especially when it comes to film. In the end, Scream 2 is a vapid bland sequel that is exactly what people would expect it to be, and nothing more. It may not be entirely predictable, but most of the time it is certainly not enjoyable.

As Good a Sequel as There Ever Could Be,"Where Kevin Williamson's screenplay drew upon the rules of slasher movies as an inspiration for a teen killer in ""Scream"", his script for the sequel in turn recognizes the rules and traditions of popular horror sequels and references itself constantly as being aware of this status.""Scream 2"" isn't as well put together as the first but director Wes Craven manages to make a pretty scary and intriguing horror romp out of Williamson's script, cleverly mixing scares and in-joke humor together to rush out a sequel to one of the greatest teen horror satires ever. There are real moments of terror in the story, which finds Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) once again dealing with a psycho slasher in a ghost mask who is stalking her and her close friends in a pleasant Ohio college town. Courteney Cox reprises her role as reporter Gale Weathers, who turned out to be an unexpected hero in ""Scream"" and returns to gain more fame, capitalizing on the murders taking place at Sidney's school. David Arquette also returns as the funny Deputy Dewey and his scenes with Gale are some of the best comic moments in the film. The cast is better in this sequel, and besides the main trio of Campbell, Cox and Arquette, Jamie Kennedy returns as movie buff Randy, and you've also got appearances by Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jada Pinkett Smith, Jerry O'Connell, and even the always delightful Laurie Metcalfe (of ""Roseanne"" fame) in a hilarious cameo role as an aspiring reporter.Where the film is overlong, it proves itself to be an ultimately entertaining and clever retread of the first. ""Scream 2"" still takes the time to establish its characters and environment before people start getting picked off by the killer. Wes Craven has an eye for scary chase scenes and these are the highlight of the film. Among these are a jolting car chase, a clever revamp of the opening from the first film set in a sorority house, and even a surprise moment of horror in a crowded movie theater at the premiere of ""Stab"", ironically, a film within a film gimmick based on the events of the first film. It's touches like this that keep ""Scream 2"" above routine slasher material, but not for long.

okay sequel,"well I'm quite fond of the scream franchise, i will say scream 2 would be second rate out of the trilogy. it shows all the cast of the original reprising their roles, the character I'm most fond of is Courtney cox's(Gail weathers). the story is a bit weak towards the original and the scares are not as good as the first. but it is enjoyable to watch. i like the way they cast Sarah Michelle gellar in the film but not the way they killed her off, i think she is good in horror films. it is bloodier than the first, the good part of the story i like is when the trio find out when the firsts killers mother is the killer in this and the tense finale. my actually favorite scene in the film is when dooy and Gail meet up again for the first time in the film and the music playing compliments it, all in all the film is okay,if it was more scary and more like the original,the story is good but the scare factor should be better. its good but not great.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"As good, if not, better than its predecessor","*** out of (****)Just a year later, and the gang's back. Director Craven and screenwriter Williamson are back for a second round. And this time, it's with good intentions. Necessary? I perhaps not, but effective? Certainly. The body count's increasing, and the games are back and better than ever.What separates ""Scream 2"" from the other lackluster sequels is how true it stays to its source material, while bringing something new to the table. In my opinion, while ""Scream"" was unpredictable, this film is definitely more surprising in terms of the whodunit premise. There are tons of twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my seat.Not to mention the performances are still strong. The characters have matured and are evolving in their roles, which is always welcome. The script... what can I say? The one liners pack the same hard punch, and the lines are delivered greatly. As for the suspense, there's definitely more where that came from. ""Scream 2"" doesn't skimp on the goods.Also, remember the iconic 12-minute opening in ""Scream"". Yeah well, ""Scream 2""'s is just as great. Without spoiling too much, the setting's at a movie theatre, and boy does it not disappoint.Anything else? While this is one neat production, I thought the film was bloodier, but not gorier. ""Scream"", in terms of deaths, is stronger, whereas ""Scream 2"" consists of mostly just stabs and ounces of that red stuff.""Scream 2"" is another home run for Craven. The film might closely resemblance ""Scream"" (maybe a little TOO closely), but it offers just a little something special for the beloved fans. ""Scream 2"" is as good, if not, better than its predecessor.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Slightly better than the original,"I am very surprised at the three star rating on here. Rotten Tomatoes (a website that's not a fan of sequels) gave this a (slightly) better rating than the first (Scream: 78%, Scream 2: 81%, it's not much but still.) This is a sequel that won't disappoint, it's still very clever, and a tad better than the original. The characters, new ones and survivors, are well acted and likable. The scares and chase scenes are very effective, and I'm sure you will find yourself at the edge of your seat in many scenes, and you're gonna jump a lot too. The script is pretty great also. The twist (and the rest of the film too) pack many surprises. So, if you haven't seen Scream 2, and are a fan of the first Scream, I recommend this movie to you. 8.8/10 (P.S. don't look at the IMDb page for Scream 3 if you haven't seen this one, it will (obviously) tell you who survives this movie)",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Typical sequel but still good enough all.,"To be fair, as far as slasher movies go, this is still one of the better ones to watch out there. When compared to the first ""Scream"" movie it isn't nearly as good but when judged on its own, it's a quite good and enjoyable genre movie.There are more than a few reasons why this movie is inferior to its predecessor, that got released only a year before this movie did. First and foremost, it is because it's all not as fresh anymore of course as the first movie still was. The first movie redefined the genre and really brought the slasher genre back again. What does this sequel do? More of the same really, only worse and less original.So the story is definitely less fresh and less original this time, which also makes the movie a bit ineffective at times. I still like the beginning of this movie very much and probably more than the the opening sequence of the first original movie but after that the movie runs out of steam and good ideas pretty fast. It doesn't always manage to build up its tension well, which is probably because it's too self aware of its self as well. The first movie more or less poked fun at the genre and all of its rules but this one takes itself even less serious. This really goes at the expense of all of its tension.The movie also definitely starts to loose it more toward its end. It's final 20 minutes or so just aren't much good or interesting as a climax, mostly because the killer(s) gets revealed after that point but its identity and motivation aren't exactly being the most convincing or cleverly written and very forgettable to be honest. I had seen this movie in the past, even more than once I believe but I really didn't membered who the killer(s) was in this movie.But like mentioned before, as a genre movie this still remains a perfectly good and watchable one. It's a whodunit slasher, with plenty of good characters and also still some good killings. Ghostface also remains a perfect evil killer for this type of movie and it of course doesn't matter who the killer behind the mask is really for the Ghostface killer to simply keep doing his thing.It's also quite amazing to see how many great well known actors appeared in Scream movies, before their big breakthrough as well known stars. That goes for this movie more than any other one out of the series perhaps. Liev Schreiber's role gets really expanded this time and the movie also stars newcomers Timothy Olyphant and Jerry O'Connell, among many others.But what's also a strength of these movies is that it manages to keep most of its crew but also cast together for all of its movies. Basically everyone that survived the first movie returns in this one and play an important role once more. I guess it's not entirely necessary but it still is what makes the series consistently fun and also makes it distinct itself from other long running horror movie series.Don't expect the first movie and you'll still have a good time with this one.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Once was enough,"I must be the only person who simply didn't enjoy the Scream trilogy. At school, everyone raved about how great and scary it was, yet when I finally saw it, I almost cried when I realized that I had spent five bucks on it to rent it.The plot is basically the same as the first one with nothing new or inventive. If Scream had been made with no sequels, I would have no complaints, but the whole thing seems like Dawson's Creek with murders.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Nutshell Review: Scream 2,"Given the success of the original Scream, it is inevitable that there would be a sequel, bringing back cast members from the first movie who survived the massacre (Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courteney Cox), and adding new popular faces that would add to the body count, like the underutilized Sarah Michelle Gellar.In case you've forgotten the iconic beginnings of this franchise, it is again reprised with a movie within a movie, as Gail Weather's (Cox) successful book about the incident has been turned into a movie called Stab, starring Heather Graham in Drew Barrymore's role, and David Schwimmer (not seen though) and Tori Spelling in the roles of Arquette's and Campbell's respectively. It's an incredibly cheesy beginning, which stayed true to the way the original was played out, and guest stars Jada Pinkett Smith too.With the original Scream poking fun at slasher flicks in general, this sequel pokes fun at, you'd guess it, sequels. A new copycat serial killer is in town and stalking Sidney (Campbell) and the surviving gang has to race against time to try and find out who this sicko might be. Could it be a copycat down to the last detail such that Sidney's new boyfriend, an alpha-male jock, is involved? Or one of the surviving cast from the first film? Or how about the innocently accused Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) who's released from prison, and wanting to get back at Sidney for putting him in jail? The gore factor definitely has been reduced (or was it because I was watching a Code 3 version?) and relies on the usual soundtrack crescendos to pull in the screams (put intended)? And speaking of the soundtrack, there were moments were Broken Arrow's was used liberally throughout. The in-jokes and numerous references which made the first Scream a darling, were sadly missed in the sequel.The ending again is a twist when the killer is revealed. Though like all predictable villains, a long extended monologue always seemed to be the order of the day. Guess that's just the way the genre goes. Like what was mentioned, there are only a few sequels which surpass their originals, and sadly, Scream 2 is not one of them.Code 3 DVD was a barebones version, nothing special included, which is a pity.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Aliens was better than Alien. That's all I have to say.,"When 'Scream 2' came out, now more than a decade ago, I loved it. In fact, it landed on my top 10 superior (or equal to) sequels to the originals. Now, watching the trilogy complete, it's not as good as I remembered it. Sure it has a lot of good points: Courtney and Neve look great! The tongue-in-cheek sequel jokes/statements are great. I always love Olyphant, Pinkett, Jackson and Gellar. And they really up'd the ante on making the now-familiar ""whodunit"" storyline a little more mysterious. Unfortunately, the bad way outweighs the good. Though, I loved the creativity, dialogue and theme to the opening, it was just plain way too drawn out and pointless to the remainder of the movie. (I see how they matched the first movie's intro, but at least that was more scary and interesting, overall.) The rest of the movie follows suit – it's way longer than it needed to be, so much could've been cut. And the coincidences/plot holes were pretty thick. It's years later, they've made a movie(-within a movie, 'Stab') which apparently sparks another blood bath for anyone who hangs out with the survivors from part one. I don't want to sound too harsh; I enjoyed this feature, it has a lot of creativity to it and it's worth watching. It has some intense scenes – my favorite is the courtyard search, but coincidentally it saddens me that my favorite character is off'd during this scene. I can't spoil too much, but the closing (another long and drawn out scene) had me rolling my eyes. As did that horrible 'Top Gun' homage. I am not at all a fan of Jerry O'Connell and definitively not one of the worst actors: Liev Schreiber, and he didn't do much to change that here. Still worth a view.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

But it is still worth picking up but not that gory as the original one. What was nice is that all characters were back with their original thespians and that did add something towards the belief in the story.Another success it became and the franchise was started.

It was indeed better then part 1,"Yes, it's true that original movies, like part 1 of any movie or series is claimed to be the ""best"", just because it kicked off everything.Well if that's so true?

Is it better then part 1, much much better. Non-stop action and killing. Story was good and had twists. The first 1, was more like an 80's slasher flick. It really didn't have much of a moral, it did have you wanting to ask more questions.This movie did have a huge cast of names, that a big now. Omar Epps, Jada Pinkett Smith, just to name a few. But sorry to dissappoint, but Elise Neal stole some of the movie, from Neve Campbell. She was much prettier and had personality, not ""dim-wittedness"".If someone would like non-stop action horror with a good story and the least amount of ""yawns"" and slow-downs in a movie, watch this.

"An idea worthy as a sequel, an execution that almost measures up","After Scream respectfully made fun of the slasher sub-genre, this sequel was done. In addition to more satire and clever jabs at the films, from the very first scene, this also has some material on sequels in the genre. An obvious choice, yes, but why not? Such would not have worked in the first film, for self-explanatory reasons, and while it may not all be of quite as high quality as that of the film preceding this, there are still points made. The plot is fairly good, but the reveal at the end is just not as effective as the one of the first(which, going by the Trivia, can be attributed to the original script leaking... thanks, guys, *now* will ya just let them make the movies in peace?). There are suspenseful and tense scenes in this, as well, and, as the sequel rules dictate(and as is said out loud within the film), this is bigger than the first. There's more blood and gore(though I'm not sure the death scenes are necessarily better than, or even match, the ones of the original). The characters are reasonably well-done, if the new ones aren't as interesting as those of the first. At least one character of the first gets more of a role. This picks up nicely from the first(not *right* where it left off), and should definitely not be watched prior to watching the first. If you have, however, watched Scream and want more of the same, this'll do nicely. It isn't quite as good, but it is worth watching. Score, music and sound is well-done. This has some good scares, too. I recommend this to any fan of the first, horror and/or respectful parodies of said genre, specifically earlier-mentioned sub-genre. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

More Funny Than Scary,"I tend to think of Scream 2 as a comedy. The first Scream, obviously, was a by-the-books horror film that worked, because it knew its own tricks, but fell into them anyway. Very post-modern. But Scream 2, in my opinion, is more of a comedy. The opening scene at the movie theatre is a hilarious send-up of the weird phenomenon that the original film became. The movie satirizes Hollywood and the media, showing how truly ridiculous it can be when the press latches on to a particular tragic story, blowing it out of proportion until it becomes less about the people involved and more about the very fact that it even happened. I, for one, loved many of the little in-jokes (""it was my head on Jennifer Aniston's body""). Granted, we'll have to explain them to our kids when they catch it on USA twenty years from now, but no one ever said it was timeless. And yes, the ending is weird and forced (though i do love the line, ""bob dole on the witness stand, IN MY DEFENSE"") and lacks the surprise of the original.

"Like Most Sequels, Nowhere Near the First","For some reason, Scream 2 seems like a movie that was forced to be made just because of the huge success of the first's original formula, that is, to overtly reveal the cheap tricks of the horror movie.  It doesn't seem fresh, has a thin storyline, contrived characters, plays like a rehash, and concludes with an ending that seems patched on and is completely unsatisfying.Scream 2 starts up with a fantastic shocker of a scene, where a murder takes place in a movie theater showing the film ""Stab,"" a spinoff of the events in Woodsboro in the first Scream film.  It's a terrific opening, as we see that Neve Campbell is now in college and is unnerved by the killing, suspecting it could be the 'sequel' she was warned about in the first installment.While the movie may start with a fantastic, twisted scene, it's all downhill from there.  The survivors from Scream are back, and their familiarity helps bolster the sometimes slow, plodding scenes.  There's also much more gore here, but while Scream used it sporadically, Scream 2 certainly seems to rely on it to shock its viewers rather than the clever, manipulative scripting of the first.  The device of revealing the horror movie convention doesn't seem as fresh anymore; instead it seems like a cheap convention itself.Not to say there aren't some scenes in Scream 2 that aren't wonderfully shot by Wes Craven, including a thrilling (if not too short) car chase, a frenzied search for a cell phone, and a poignant death.  But it's ending is much too farfetched and strikes the viewer much like the killer strikes with his knife: completely out of nowhere, without warning.Scream is by far the superior of the trilogy, feeling much more inventive than this sequel.  When a film student in the movies remarks that ""the sequel destroyed the genre,"" you can't help but feel it's true at the end of this movie.

"Lesser sequel, but at least they knew it and laughed about it.","The undeniable best sequence in this film – as well as in all three ""Scream"" films, for that matter – involves the geeky horror connoisseur character Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy) fanatically venting about his favorite, albeit cliché-laden genre. As this is a rapidly produced sequel to an unexpectedly successful horror blockbuster, Randy – with the help of an entire movie class - vividly rants how sequels never match up against the ingenuity and intellect of their predecessors. That scene alone is pretty clever already, in fact, because it feels as if director Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson want to safeguard themselves against delivering a potentially inferior product. ""Scream 2"" isn't a bad film, especially not in comparison with the majority of horror junk that was coming out in the aftermath of the original ""Scream"", but indeed no match for the first. The screenplay actually does faithfully feature all the sequel clichés, like a higher death toll (particularly near the end, it seems like everybody must die) and a bloodier make-up effects. The film is also overlong and tries to be a little too clever in all its 90's pop-culture observations. Good aspects, however, include the successful change of location from a typical small town towards a university campus. Both settings are typical 80's horror fare settings. The survivors of the original film have obviously grown in their roles and the production managed to attract some interesting fresh new faces for the principal roles (like Timothy Olyphant, Jerry O'Connell and Sarah Michelle Gellar) as well as some cool cameos (like David Warner, Heather Graham and Luke Wilson). The plot of the sequel is as simplistic and rudimentary as that of the original. Sidney Prescott and her friend Randy are trying to carry on with their lives two years after the Woodsboro murders. When a young couple gets killed during the premiere of ""Stab"" – a horror flick based on the Woodsboro murders – it quickly becomes clear there's a copycat killer after Sidney.

The best part of the series convinces with more focus on the best characters and a sinister atmosphere,"After a rather superficial first part, the second movie of the Scream series has been a step forward. The scarface killer is more intelligent, more brutal and more mysterious and a couple of surprises keep you hanging on until the end of the movie. The second part also focuses more on some of the stronger characters of the first part such as the intriguing and wrongfully suspected Cotton Weary, the journalist Gale Weathers that shows some unknown emotional sides beyond her facades of a seemingly egoist personality and the police deputy Dewey Riley that turns out to be much more clever and courageous than it seemed in the first part where he got completely dumped.On a negative side, the opening scene in the cinema shows already the main fan base of the first movie and one realizes that the main concept didn't change as the movie desperately tries to parody its predecessor, to include some stereotypical citations of classic horror movies and to introduce some new stupid teenage characters. The final conclusion to this movie is even more stupid as the ending of the first part and somewhat lacks of originality. That means that you still have to switch your brain off and look over details concerning annoying characters, horrible dialogues or lacks of originality in the script.Overall, this movie has still more suspense than the first part, concentrates on better actors and has a higher degree of dark atmosphere. It's a gripping flick that concentrates as much on the entertaining and humorous side of the movie as on the mystery and horror factor. I would say that this movie is easily the best part of the series until now but it can't mess with the classics of the suspense or horror genre.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Worst movie ever,"The original Scream was a good movie. It wasn't exactly the artistic highlight of the century, but it was good entertainment and it stands as one of the best scary movies of the 90's.After seeing Scream, I looked forward to see the sequel. I'd heard bad rumors about it, but I actually didn't care. It turned out to be the biggest disappointment I've ever had (when it comes to films, anyway). I don't know if it was because of the bad directing, because of all the stupid clichés or just because the film and its story was generally boring, but I thought it was the worst film I'd ever seen. And I still do.I can accept the scary movies that are made just to make money (what isn't?), I can accept most of these movies' lack of quality, but I can not accept Scream 2. It was just too bad. My rating: 1/10. The worst movie ever.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Just wanted to give a nice, little review, that's all","NOT! I am here to trash all over ""Scream 2"" and the myriad of movies just like it. (Please note that ""Scream"" part one is still a good movie if you can try to forget the awfulness of sequels like this and tons of rip-offs, and their sequels, too!) Alright, first of all: The writing was pretty stale by this entry because ""Scream"" part one was so big that within a year or so this self-referentiality stuff was already devoid of its once clever flair. (And, just to make the fact known, there were many self-referential horror movies done before ""Scream"", meaning Wes Craven really did nothing new.) Next: The one really fun character left from part one was Jamie Kennedy's character, the video geek that all of us horror-obsessed video geeks could relate to. He gets offed halfway through the movie after making one of the only clever jokes in this entire mess. I'm sure Craven did this to be unpredictable and shock audiences by depicting the death of a character they cared about. Why didn't that stuck-up, ""capitalist-with-a-heart-of-gold"" character of Courtney Cox's get offed? I guess Craven couldn't please everybody, but it was a pretty bad idea no matter how many critics said he was being ""hip and smart"". Reason number three comin' up: The ending was not a stunning surprise like in the first film. It seemed almost as if Craven tacked on some lackluster footage at the last minute (which is pretty believable when you consider the fact that he wrote a few different endings to this). Yes, this is just another ""Friday the 13th"" sequel, except without the gore and sleazy nudity that kept those films from being totally dull. So the next time someone who praises crap like this out the wazoo is about to trash on a much better low-budget film, remember that the budget is not what makes a movie good. Just as Jello from the Dead Kennedys criticized the MTV ""culture"" in that band's classic song ""MTV Get Off the Air"", what are you people? Accountants or movie fans?",,Anonymous,Horror
"The sequel is also the darkest movie of all, critically questioning the consequences of horror and popularizing a myth (apparently) unintentionally","It's been two years and the murders in Woodsboro have been translated onto the movie screen. Gale Wheaters (Courtney Cox) managed to achieve the media positioning she wanted and is the author of The Killers of Woodsboro book, transported to film as The Stab. Sidney Prescott is now a sad and lonely college student (Neve Campbell), but she will need to reinvent herself: the media is on her trail due to the movie theater murders, mainly because the murdered girl is named Maureen Evans (Jada Pinket Smith, who by the way, stars in an excellent opening scene), the same name as his mother. To make matters worse, Cotton Weaver (Liev Schrieber) is on the loose, participates in media programs and wants to make his innocence an advertising theme. Dewey (David Arquette), upon being informed of the crimes, sets off to meet Sidney. He, Gale, Sidney and Randy (Jamie Kennedy) must fight for survival.The prologue to Scream 2 is promising: it is set in the popular debut of the film inspired by the events of Scream (1996), or rather, based on the series of murders that took place in the small town of Woodboro, California. In line for the session, a black couple discuss racial inequality in horror cinema just before being brutally murdered by a new Ghostface. The sequence ends with one of the victims agonizing between the screen and the darkroom audience - where many are costumed as the masked killer. The ironic, self-referential and very symbolic introduction makes clear everything that will come next, a sharp and refined sequence that owes nothing to its original. In addition to aiming his gaze at himself, Scream 2 directs his perspective towards his viewers, their expectations and frustrations with genre cinema. Williamson has composed his script with so many layers - from satire to parody, through social and intellectual criticism - in a narrative that is fun and uneconomical in blood or suspense.Williamson's script doesn't have the same originality as the first one, but he manages to address and satirize many issues involving the genre. If in the first film, the focus was around the clichés and convenient situations of the genre, in the second the focus is on the question: ""Could a sequel be better than the original?"". In one of the most interesting scenes of the direction, Randy is discussing this same question with the other students in film class. The fan-loved character claims that no sequel is better than the original even with other students citing such successful sequels as ""Terminator 2"", ""Aliens"" and ""The Godfather - Part 2"" (film which Randy claims to be "" An exception among Oscar winners""). The truth is that there is no shortage of examples of good and bad sequels. And the main success of the script for ""Scream 2"" is knowing how to handle it in an exceptional way. Other discussions are addressed, such as whether violence in a movie can influence someone in real life, but none is as well explored as the one mentioned above. The script also plays with the famous rules of horror movie sequences, according to Randy they are: the number of deaths is always higher than in the first film, the death scenes are much more elaborate and with more blood, the survivors from the original massacre are the prime targets of the new assassin and it should never be assumed that the assassin is dead. Another tip would be said by Randy, but he was interrupted by Dewey.Kevin Williamson also tried to include in the script a few more interesting characters: Hallie (Elise Neal), Mickey (Timothy Olyphant) and Derek (Jerry O'Connel), Sidney's new boyfriend. Marco Beltrami returns to sign the sound work, along with editor Patrick Lussier, a professional who accompanied Wes Craven during the films of the saga. Who also returns and prints a student atmosphere, but stylized, is the director of photography Peter Deming. The scenic space, the depth of field (especially in the scenes in more closed places) and the creative role of the camera are the important technical highlights for conducting this very dynamic narrative.Scream 2 relies on the hooks left by the first film to elaborate its plot. The metalanguage exercise remains intact, since this sequence uses the rules imposed by its gender, in order to create something new, in other words, original. While in the first film, the killer brought his fascination for horror movies when elaborating the murders, in Scream 2, the ""Ghostface"" attacks again, but here he intends to continue what was left by the killer(s) of the previous film, therefore, the deaths here are premeditated according to the gaps that were left by the events of the first feature.Sociologically speaking, this second chapter explores very hard-hitting issues in relation to the media and television news that squeeze blood into daily programs. We know there is a need for information, but violence has become even more a spectacle these days, and the director and screenwriter, as if they were predicting the future, bet on addressing this trivialization of violence. Gale plays this role very well and the dialogues with his new cameraman border on sensational. Sarcastic, ironic and shameless: all the reporter initially wants is to be awarded and to get her ""scoops"" in her reports.Wes Craven gets the steering right again, managing to create tense and thought-provoking scenes, such as the scene of the phone calls in the park or the murder scene that takes place in the Omega Beta Zeta brotherhood. But the scene Craven's direction hits the hardest is where Dewey and Gale are trying to figure out who the killer is by filming Gale's cameraman, Joel, in a large, completely empty space. The tension in this sequence is capable of leaving many viewers glued to their seats, appearing among one of the best scenes in the entire franchise. The opening scene, while inferior to the original, is also striking and well thought out without a repeat of horror movie trivia or killer mind games.The director reframes the common codes of sequences in a direction that proves best when stripped of affectation or exaggeration. It's in economics that the filmmaker excels: its climax has all the grandeur of a Greek tragedy, but it's sequences like the one with Sidney and her friend in the police car that impress. The time Craven devotes to building the suspense is meticulously planned, which guarantees a better result when your intention is to shock with the excess of blood and viscera or electrify in moments of cat-and-mouse chase, or more directly, Ghostface and its victims. Marco Beltrami's soundtrack is highlighted once again, but here it fights for prominence with other pieces created by Hans Zimmer and Danny Elman.This time, the characters gain further development and the spectator cares about many of them, great merit of which goes to their performance. Neve Campbell is performing even better than the first movie delivering a Sidney who is strong but also terrified of her enemy's return. In one of the best scenes of the movie Sidney is doing a play where she plays the figure of Greek mythology Cassandra and Craven plays very well with the paranoia that the character feels every second. The actress demonstrates a versatility for impressive drama and suspense, unfortunately unexplored in the upcoming two installments of the franchise. This time around, Courteney Cox's indiscreet reporter and David Arquette's blind detective gain more prominence and better dialogue, which overwhelm the rest of the cast destined to undeveloped characters and closer to the archetypes that the film itself tries to subvert.Williamson's script ends up failing in parts, where the characters end up making unwise decisions and choosing the worst places to hide. The assassin's revelation was not surprising either, it may be something already expected by some, with the motive of the killing not being so well developed. The pair of assassins and their reasons are the most preposterous and improbable, but efficient in the mythology of the film when considering the debauchery to which the Scream saga is disposed. Mrs. Loomis even has a convincing motive. Revenge, after all, Sidney killed his son, but Mickey's is pretty clueless. In fact, she doesn't even have a real motive.However, the second film's biggest flaw lies in the fact that it was architected in a year, and with that, inevitably, some edges remained meaningless, limiting the capabilities that this sequel could reach. Certain characters are little explored by the film, and, unlike the first one, here they seem out of place in terms of their position in the events. To quote, the identity of a certain character as the ""Ghostface"" seemed completely blurred, serving more as a scheme programmed by the script to adhere to some function of the subject. Due to this flaw, and other mistakes in its narrative rhythm (which sometimes becomes monotonous, something that did not happen in the first one), Scream 2 becomes a smaller shadow of its predecessor. But, although this happens, what we have here is still a delicious work to be followed, which also earns points for managing not to spoil the merits conquered by its predecessor (something very common in sequels). The sequel to the original is also the darkest movie of all, critically questioning the consequences of horror and popularizing a myth (apparently) unintentionally. This is an achievement of the beautiful partnership between Williamson and Craven, something that resulted in a franchise that, even if today is not so appreciated for its cinematographic attributes, is certainly loved by the brand that has carved out a generation.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

More of the Same,"Scream 2 is unique in the sense that it offers more of the exact same thing from the original, but it manages to pull it off slightly better.Granted, that's not to say it's a good film.We open up in a theater for the premiere of the tackiest film-within-a-film that's perhaps ever been committed to screen: a theatrical adaptation of the murders that occurred in the first film, based on the book written by the local reporter that involved herself in the original film. Of course, because it's a horror movie, we're gonna hand out masks of the killer to everyone in the audience so they can wear them and pretend to stalk around the theater killing the audience members, and it's all fun and games... until it's not.The opening for this film is the best thing it's got going for itself, because the rest of the film is just more of the same. It has a lot of the same cast from the original (a commendable achievement), including Neve Campbell's Sidney Prescott, who finds herself once again getting strange phone calls from a voiceboxed serial killer. It's a continuation of the same character-study kind of work that was done in the first one, expanding upon Sidney's badassery but not really justifying its own existence.You've got Jerry O'Connell (of Stand By Me fame) in perhaps the most awkward musical number in a horror film of all time, and even the great Laurie Metcalf (fresh off Roseanne at the time) couldn't save this film.It expands upon the relationship between the reporter, Gail, and the police officer Dewey, which really isn't interesting at all and provides nothing to the plot but filler material.Just like the first one, this film is way too long and they're trying to do far too much with it. It would've been a satisfactory experience at 80-90 minutes with most of the subplots either cut entirely or edited down to practically nothing and with the focus almost exclusively on the slasher element.This film is just a rehash of the original, trying to take what Wes did for the genre with the original and take it a step further. As is often the case with films like this, it takes everything two steps back. However, this film manages to have at least a couple entertaining scenes scattered throughout the boring and ass-numbingly long runtime.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A few shocks but lacked a good mystery,"Some sequels require you to see the original movie before you really understand what the sequel is all about.  Well, I saw Scream about a year ago, and I still didn't follow some of Scream 2.This movie (like the original) did not live up to its name.  It didn't make me scream.  Yes there were scares, and I found myself at times shouting ""Don't do it!"" to these stupid college girls who seem to lack common sense in the face of impending death.Despite the plot being obviously focused for screams and laughs only and nothing more intelligent, this film did have me gripped.  But I still believe Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson need to learn an important lesson.  The more credible the story, the more frightening it's going to be.As with the original, the end of the movie was a let-down.  Revealing the identity of the serial killers in a classic ""I'm now going to explain exactly why I've been killing everybody"" scenario smothers the atmosphere so carefully crafted.  Whatever happened to mystery and suspense?",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Many people believe that Scream 2 is better than the first. On the other hand, I believe that this is a great sequel, but I didn't enjoy it as much as the first.In this film, history repeats itself.

All the people in the cinema are wearing ghost-face costumes perfect cover for ghost-face eh?

Even worse the second time around.,"""Scream 2"" is a movie that asks you to believe another serial killer has targeted young Sidney Prescott (survivor of the first film, and now a college student). If this weren't enough to swallow, her high school friend and fellow survivor from the first film, Randy, conveniently goes to the same university. And wouldn't you know it, along come the other remaining survivors, so now everyone can play along in another round of the same old game. How convenient, eh? Once again, the killer is able to accomplish many things by seemingly pure, blind luck (only in the movies). The opening of the film is a laughable exercise of a series of implausible events that lead to the first deaths in the movie, kick-starting an entire series of conveniences for the killer to do his work aided as if by the gods of Hollywood themselves. Characters manage to get into situations that would only happen in the movies, and the killer is presented with opportunities to chase our poor survivors down school corridors and alleys, all making great scenes that belong right in a movie, yet ironically the characters are self-aware of all the clichés even when they are a part of them.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Meta Horror: The Sequel (in which it is freaking great),"Okay, so if Scream was a commentary on horror movies playing around with the tropes then Scream 2 is a commentary on sequels. What feels so great about this movie is that it doesn't take itself too seriously, it knows it's stupid and it revels in it. It's nice that most of the core cast (except for the ones that were killed in the last movie) are back and they all play their roles well... however I was kind of surprised how they say in one scene that the typical horror movie sequels have more elaborate and gory scenes than the first ones but in this one the kills aren't very scary or elaborate, I feel like the first one in that aspect is scarier than the sequel. In this sense it feels more like a comedy accented thriller, but alas it is still scary, kinda.I love the humour, it is somehow more accentuated here than in the first movie and it's so funny how it even has some 4th wall breaking moments referencing to actors current movies or the show jobs that they're in which is so funny. They all did a good job, there's no super high brow acting or anything like that, it's just fun! I guess David Arquette does a standout job as Dewey but he's always charming lol!Either way, if you have seen the first one then you should absolutely see this one!

"Not quite as good as the original, but possibly funnier...","(*** out of *****)This sequel is even more of an homage to late-70s and early-80s slashers than the first one.  It borrows generously from such college-campus-killer classics as ""Black Christmas,"" ""He Knows You're Alone"" (the opening scene) and ""Final Exam"" (the hazing scene) as well as the original ""Friday the 13th.""  This is not quite as good as the first, and parts of it are a bit tedious (for example, anyone else notice how the killer(s) is always getting his ass kicked by Neve Campbell, but then seems to have no trouble taking on TWO burly police detectives?), but it still has enough clever twists, amusing dialogue and suspenseful set pieces to make it enjoyable.  I love how this movie even satirizes itself by having the movie-within-a-movie storyline (""Stab,"" with Tori Spelling, Luke Wilson, and Heather Graham!)  Along with Campbell, Courtney Cox, David Arquette, Liev Schreiber, and Jamie Kennedy (from the first film), we get new victims Jerry O'Connell, Jada Pinkett Smith, and `Buffy,' herself, Sarah Michelle Geller.  Rebecca Gayheart and Portia de Rossi are also pretty funny as airhead sorority girls, but Arquette and Kennedy are the two funniest ones to watch this time around (there scene together in the diner is the comic-highlight of the film.)HIGHLIGHT:  Well, either the above-mentioned diner scene or the scene where Campbell and her friend (Elise Neal) have to squeeze past the unconscious body of the killer from the back seat of a wrecked police car.",,Anonymous,Horror
Two years later...,"Honestly, I enjoyed Scream 2 even more than the original. The returning characters felt much more at home in the story, and their development added depth to the overall plot. The sequel carried forward the humor, tension, and self-awareness of the first film but executed it with a more refined approach.One of the standout aspects was the heightened sense of mystery. Even though there weren't a vast number of suspects, the story kept me guessing until the big reveal. The red herrings were well-placed, making it harder to pinpoint the killer's identity compared to the first movie.The relationships also felt more natural and fleshed out. The romance was integrated seamlessly without overshadowing the core tension, and the characters' dynamics had a stronger emotional resonance. Each person's reaction to the events unfolding around them felt more grounded, which made their survival - or demise - hit harder emotionally.What really elevated this film for me was how it expanded on the themes of the original while still keeping things fresh. The meta-commentary about horror movie sequels was clever without being too heavy-handed, blending smoothly into the story.Overall, Scream 2 managed to up the stakes while retaining the essence that made the first movie iconic. It's a well-crafted continuation that proves sequels can be just as, if not more, engaging than their predecessors.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

My favorite of the three films.,"Two years has passed... the infamous murders at Woodsboro has turned into a movie. Since the novel is written by reporter Gale Wheaters (Courtney Cox). Two college students (Jada Pinkett Smith and Omar Epps) were killed in a sneak peak of a horror movie called ""Stab"", which is based on Wheaters' book. Now Sidney (Neve Campbell), Randy (Jamie Kennedy), Dewey (David Arquette), Gale and Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) find themselves in danger. This killer certainly wants something from Sidney, so she's also putting her boyfriend (Jerry O'Connell) and her two friends (Timothy Olyphant & Elise Neal) in deep trouble as well.Directed by Wes Craven (The Hills Have Eyes, The Last House on the Left, Shocker) made an truly enjoyable sequel to ""Scream"" that is even more entertaining and funnier than the original. The script by Kevin Williamson (Cursed, Teaching Miss Tingle) certainly made some truly fun writing about the rules of a sequel. This was just as a blockbusters as the original was. Some film critics (For example the late Gene Siskel) felt the sequel was much better. There's an amusing film within the film, which those scenes are directed (uncredited) by Robert Rodriguez (Spy Kids Trilogy, Grindhouse, The Faculty).The Original DVD has an sharp non-anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD includes Cast & Crew information and the original theatrical trailer. The only flaw in the sequel is the conclusion, which is a bit too much. ""Scream 2"" has many funny moments as well for suspenseful moments. A good cast certainly helps.

Exception to the Sequel Rule,"In one early scene, Randy claims that sequels are inherently inferior. The characters then list several examples of sequels that have matched and possibly surpassed the original. And Scream 2 ranks among them.Scream 1 was great. I gave it a wonderful review. But somehow, Scream 2 managed to do it all better. The suspense is greater, the kills gorier, the laughs funnier, and cast better.With Scream 1 having been made into a movie within the movie, Sydney and the other survivors are all trying to move on with her and Randy in college finding new friends and loves. They're reunited when the killings begin again as someone sets out to make a sequel. A new setting means new rules with some twists and turns along the way.Just as before, we have no idea who the killer(s) is until the final act. We get the same kind of false leads and misdirect, such as people being gone at Ghostface's appearances and wearing the same boots as the killer. Once the identity(ies) is revealed, it's great to go back and see how the person(s) manipulated events without the mask. SPOILER Mickey's motivation works well within the movie. Ms. Loomis' also works well, but I don't like that they never really built her up. She comes out of nowhere with little basis before the finale. END SPOILERThe cast are all wonderful. Neve Campbell shows a great progression in her character, and of the four movies this is the one I think she's sexiest in. Cox, Arquette, and Kennedy all return as wonderful as before. O'Connell, Gellar, Schreiber, and Neal are great in new, or at least expanded, roles. None of them are merely copies from the first movie. Though it's Kennedy and Olyphant steal every scene they're in, much like Randy and Stu did in the first. Their dialog together is great, especially as they keep referring to various sequels. At least none of them look quite as ""evil"" as Billy did.Of course, being a horror movie it's the scares that are really matters. The suspense is built up much better than the first. The scene where Sydney must escape the cop car is probably the most suspenseful in the entire series, maybe in the genre. The movie also plays on the fact that audiences know the standards set by the original.Scream 2 is definitely on par with the original, and in my opinion the best of the series. This is definitely a must-see for fans of the original and of horror. There's really nothing to disappoint here. It may share the same general story as the original, but like Terminator 2 it adds enough to be its own experience.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not Bad,"Well, Randy, you were right. This sequel definitely did not exceed the expectations of the first Scream. I did like the plot twist with Debbie Salt revealing herself to be Billy's mom. Once again, Neve Campbell does an excellent job portraying her role as Sidney Prescott and Jamie Kennedy as the movie geek yet comical, Randy Meeks. But, I was very disappointed about the fact that they killed off Randy was the biggest mistake. I thought the trilogy would have been much better if they let him live and get Sid and kill off either Gale or Dewey. Plus the dialogue was not too great and Mickey's motive was just plain stupid. Overall I'd give this a 6-6.5/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Highly glossy, highly trashy","Scream 2 is a poor movie, honestly!.  I must admit I wasnt a big fan of the first one, and I didnt expect too much of the second.  You would think that all the ""SMART"" pretty young things, who spout off all the way through the film their knowledge of horror movies, would simply leave town for couple of weeks until the murderer was captured.  The Killer in the Scream series must be the biggest joke going, for all the amazing things he does like chasing down police cars and killing two armed cops, you would think that he would be able to chase someone through a house without clumsily tripping up over everything and anything.  Scary, my arse. I spent the best part of eight years in the states, and I never met anyone as irritating and as annoying there as the college kids in this movie, I was practically shouting for the killer as he bumped off this annoying lot.Here are are few questions that have been floating around my mind since subjecting myself to Scream 2:Is Dewey related to Michael Myers? You can stab him 1500 times and he still survives at the end.Why does the killer always turn into some third-rate comedian when unmasked? and then really emphasise the word ""F**k"" when speaking.Why does Wes Craven never have a likeable character in any of his movies?Is there any overweight or normal looking people at Sydney's College?WHAT the hell was that terrible, terrible music all about that came on whenever Dewey & Gale were in the same scene.And finally...... Why does everyone hero worship Kevin Williamson and why is his name above anyone elses on the movie posters?.  The best thing he ever wrote was the first season of Dawson's Creek (I wont take that away from him).Scream 3, No Thank you Messrs. Craven & Williamson",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Well, Randy, you were right!...","It's true -- a sequel is never as good as the original. And since the original wasn't that great...This movie DID have a few good moments (ie. Jerry O'Connell's song and dance routine), but basically it was the same as ""Scream"" -- two hours spent hoping and praying that Sidney Prescott would get it. This girl is like the kiss of death! Everyone who hangs out with her gets killed. The end of this movie (although slow and repetitive, and TOTALLY ripped off of ""Popcorn"") was infinitely better than the end of the first one, for the sole reason that one of the killers actually had an interesting motive.A request to Craven and Williamson regarding ""Scream 3"" -- please, kill off Sidney Prescott.

Okay - 3/5,"I really liked Scream 1. And I do like Scream 2.There's a lot to like here. Neve Campbell actually does better in this one than Part 1. Her acting is slightly better and the character feels a lot more mature. Gale Weathers gets a TON of development and it's really nice to see her go from one of my least favorite characters to somehow you can really cheer for at the end. They went that route with the first Scream but didn't really quite get there. It's quite impressive when you consider that Scream 2 had more a ways to go.However, the biggest problem is that the film shelves a lot of terror for character development and plot. The plot is a bit more well-rounded than the first. The characters are deeper and generally more likable. But it definitely shelves it's scares for characters. The first film managed to balance scares and substance. The ratio was more scares to substance, but this one is mostly substance over scares. Unfortunately, this film somewhat fails to balance the elements. It feels less like a horror film and more like a pretty good college flick.Not bad though. I had a blast watching it, even if I was bored during the second act.Also that twist came from left field. I don't want to talk about it but geez it was stupid",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Drop off,"I must say this film isn't as good as the first (if that's saying anything) but it is much better than part 3.  I already knew it was better than part 3, but when I first saw this I was conflicted about whether or not this film was better than the first.  Then I realized it waa almost equal in scares and laughs and surprises.  But the first was actually more original (even though it was inspired greatly by many other movies).  Actually though, that doesn't stop anyone from seeing this movie.  I still recommend this film to teens looking for a few laughs and plenty of scares in the Craven tradition.

The music by Marco Beltrami is fantastic.

Nothing Special But Not Too Bad!,"The original Scream movie is the best in my opinion. When Scream came out it was a shot in the arm for the horror genre which was slowly dying a painful death.

Everyone is a suspect in this film. No-one is above suspicion. And just like the original Scream there are plenty of red herrings along the way.Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, David Arquette and Liev Schreiber reprise their roles from the original film. Could one of them be the killer? Could it be someone who wasn't in the original film? Is it a man? Is it a woman?

The killer killed the movie,"""Scream 2"" could have been a good horror film with its fairly good cast, but unfortunately, it violates an important law of horror movies:  the killer(s) and the slayings have to be distinctive, interesting, and inspire terror from the audience!  If killing is the business of the killer(s) in ""Scream 2,"" then somebody had better file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Except for toying with Sarah Michelle Gellar over the phone a little, the killer(s) in this movie just stabs and runs.  How terrifying...Ironically, when ""Scream 2"" has an in-class discussion about sequels being inferior films, it ends up referring to itself.  The Friday the 13th series often get maligned as mindless slasher films, but at least Jason killed some of his victims in unusual ways, such as swinging one of them against a tree like an axe or smashing & electrocuting another one by smashing a TV set on his head.  If the killer(s) of ""Scream 2"" would employ methods of murder like those, then it could be deemed as a worthy sequel to the original.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Didn't ruin the legacy of its predecessor!,"I had a more or less similar experience compared to the original. The second part did not ruin the legacy of its predecessor, like most of the sequels often do. It rather capitalized on the popularity and appeal of the first film and expanded the world further.At least these newer additions (the characters and the plot) did not come across as superficial; somehow they seemed organic and came to be substantive on the whole.Having said that, I still consider the first entry to be marginally better, mainly because it was technically more fluent from a screenplay point of view.Every buildup, leading up to each kill, possessed more palpable tension and carried a certain sense of dread and intimidation.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Scream all over again, only bigger and bloodier","I thought Scream 2 wasn't really a bad movie, but It did remind of the original (and better) Scream a little bit too much, making it VERY predictable, plus I definitely think they should have killed off a lot more key characters.But the overall setting is good, the acting is 'okey' and the murders are definitely the highlight of this film, few and far apart, but the kills were more graphic and gory then the first! You get all your stabbings, head stabbings, head impalings, slashed throat and bullet wounds.Nice job! This one might just also have one of the coolest and suspenseful chase scenes EVER involving the character of Gale.Watch it for the gore, but don't expect a slasher classic like the first.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Sequels suck!""","Or so says one of the characters early on in Scream 2, which is followed by a short discussion about sequels that might just be better than the original. Is Scream 2 one of them? Definitely not. The first Scream film worked well because it played with the rules of the slasherflick (although it is far less original in this than you might think, as Wes Craven's own New Nightmare did pretty much the same thing) without subverting them and because it brought a much needed energy back into the genre. I don't think Scream is a true horror classic (I didn't think it was very scary), but it's still great fun. Scream 2 aimes for pretty much the same thing. It's another postmodern slasher where the characters know the rules of the genre and where the filmmakers play around with them.Sometimes, it still works. The whole sequel-discussion will please anyone with a casual interest in film, the cameos by Heather Graham and Tori Spelling (as Neve Campbell's character in the movie-within-the-movie based on the events in Scream) are cleverly inserted into the film and there's even a hint the filmmakers are trying to confound the audience' expectations (one slashing is an example in particular). It's not as though Kevin Williamson's film-literate script is a complete waste of time. But apart from these clever flourishes, there's very little here. Sure, he throws in 'subtexts' like the media's obsession with violence and, more notably and bravely, the whole relationship between violence in media (and film in particular) and in real-life. But as it doesn't do a lot with its subtexts, so what you're left with is your usual barrage of killings and a whodunnit storyline. And a lot of it isn't nearly as sharp as Scream. The dialogue has its moments, but the character interplay is as shallow as possible and there's an awful scene where Neve Campbell has to dodge a real knife among fake ones in a stage play. It's the type of hugely theatrical scene that doesn't work at all in this type of film. Apart from that, the conclusion to the whole whodunnit isn't nearly as satisfying as Scream's.What makes it worse is the rushed execution. Wes Craven is a gifted horror director and not a gifted stylist and Scream 2 brings out the worst in him. The entire film is shot in a dull, predictable fashion and at times it almost looks (cinematographically, anyway) random. Worse even is the handling of the typical horror film staples. The shocks are telegraphed early but don't work because of clumsy editing (the first 'shock' is a case in point). The gore level is very low (actually, apart from the sound effects there is nearly no real gore) and it doesn't have any atmosphere. Craven is talented, but here he's clearly rushed his work in order to release before the genre dies again.And that's the whole film's problem, it feels too rushed. Which is also noticeable in the music, where they use part of the Broken Arrow soundtrack as Dewey's theme (or is this a VERY misguided popculture reference?). I really think with (a lot) more polishing Scream 2 could have a competent, enjoyable romp, but as is, it's only occasionally entertaining.Rating: 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Not so bad,"Scream 2 (1997) slashes its way back into the horror scene with a gleeful and self-aware vengeance. The acting is a blood-soaked ballet of suspense, with Neve Campbell reprising her role as the ultimate survivor, and the supporting cast delivering thrills and chills in spades. The film editing is a well-crafted maze of scares, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats. The strength lies in its ability to cleverly deconstruct the conventions of its genre while still delivering genuine frights. The weakness might be a touch of predictability inherent in the genre, but it's a forgivable sin considering the film's commitment to keeping us guessing. The music is a haunting crescendo that punctuates the tension, and the cinematography captures the visceral fear lurking around every corner. With a 7/10 rating, Scream 2 is a slashing good time that not only pays homage to the slasher classics but also carves its own place in the pantheon of horror cinema.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Blame the Media!,"Scream was a cutting-edge film, the first horror movie in which the characters had seen other horror movies, knew all the conventions, and didn't make the barefaced boo-boos without letting us know that's what they were. In Scream 2, the characters have seen a movie about the first killings, and are caught once again in a slasher fantasy. Like all sequels, this one is a see-through endeavor to cash in on the original, but, naturally, it knows it is, and features its own educated discourse on sequels. The finding is that a mere handful of sequels have been as good as the originals; the characters particularly like Aliens and The Godfather Part II. As for Scream 2, it's, well, about as good as the original. Both movies use a narrative contraption for making the audience flinch and gasp and grasp their pillows. The shocks this time come from a mad slasher in an oddly unsettling Halloween ghost mask, who ambushes a slew of college freshmen who lived through the initial murders. The killer is also concerned with such hangers-on as a TV newsman and a physically and emotionally wounded former deputy sheriff.Kevin Williamson's basis this time is that violence is swiftly rendered into commercial ritual by the media: Because he is doing that very thing in Scream 2, there are paradoxes within paradoxes here. The movie is so expressive about what it's doing, in fact, that you can't knock it on that basis because it gets there first. Do movies prompt people to commit violent acts? Scream 2 seemed to think so, or is that a mocking position, to make the movie more effective? Have movies like this, by enlightening its audience to the traditions and ridiculous banalities of horror films, pacified their violence and make them less apt to be persuaded by the violence? Now there's an interesting thought.The movie's brilliant beginning sequence involves a theatrical premiere of Stab, a movie based on the killings in the first film, and at the screening two audience members are, well, see for yourself. Soon the slasher has moved to a neighboring campus, where survivors including Sidney Prescott are students, and the wounded Deputy Riley has found a job as a security guard. Also loitering is TV newswoman Gale Weathers, who---this is priceless satire---covered the first murders and wrote a best-seller about them that became ""Stab"" and has thus influenced the new murders. Also brooding around is Cotton, accused by Gale in the first film but found innocent, and now urging a second helping of his 15 minutes of fame. There is no way to predict the identity of the killer, and everyone who acts leery is (almost) certain to be innocent.The Williamson screenplay employs the horror scaffold as a rocket platform for considerable parody. I'd like to have seen him work on a more serious film. When Courteney Cox, playing the TV newswoman, is asked about her nude photos on the Internet, she replies, ""It was just my head. It was Jennifer Aniston's body."" And a killer says he wants to be caught, because he's already determined his plan of action: ""The movies made me do it,"" he'll proclaim, and he plans to have Bob Dole as a witness for the defense. ""I'll get Cochran!"" he boasts. ""The Christian Coalition will pay for my defense!"" Wes Craven was made to direct the Scream films. One of the most productive of horror filmmakers, he made The Hills Have Eyes and the Nightmare on Elm Street movies, and was already headed in the same metatextual trajectory as Williamson when he wrote and directed Wes Craven's New Nightmare in 1994, which took his own series' blurring of reality and nightmares to a new extreme, Freddy crossing over to attack the filmmakers in the ""real"" world. There's a difference here in the Scream movies where an all-new slasher killer causes the post-modern irony to be more disguised, and what might be the most ironic thing about these ever more ironic movies is that it resuscitated the entire genre. Spawning countless imitations, the joke is on them!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Cow Manure,"Scream(1996) proved to be the major undoing of the Hollywood Horror film and Scream 2(1997) continues the trend of overrated and overbearing horror features in the USA.  This proves that most filmmakers in American today are clueless when it comes to making great horror films.  Scream 2(1997) begins on a good note but degenerates into a 2 hour repeat of the first film.  The opening scene in the movie theatre is a good homage to Lamberto Bava'a Demons(1985).  The acting overall is as lousy as the first film.  The movies of Dario Argento and Mario Bava may have had their share of flaws, but overall they almost always delievered something magnificent.The first two Scream movies would have been wise to spent less time having the murderers behaving like failed stand up comics and more time making them into scary figures.  Neve Campbell gives the only decent performance of the feature.  Its a pity that she has to again run from her attacker until she is put in a corner.  The success of Kevin Williamson as a Horror Screenwriter must be a sign of the times.  I do not believe that he would have the same success in the late 1960's to mid 1980's because people had higher standards for horror films then.Wes Craven has shown with his involvement in the Scream trilogy that he's a has been filmmaker.  At least movie makers like Dario Argento, George A. Romero, and David Cronenberg have not sold themselves out.  Scream 2(1997) plays its homage to the college theme slasher flicks of the early to mid 1980's.  It also rips off great Italian Giallos such as Torso(1973), Deep Red(1975), and Tenebre(1982).  If Tenebre's final fifteen minutes were breathtaking then the final fifteen minutes of Scream 2(1997) were horendous.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Just as entertaining as the original, but maybe slightly better","After moving to college to remove herself from her past, a woman and her friends find themselves the target of a copycat killer intending to seek revenge for her previous activities and must stop the hooded-figure's rampage.A fairly worthy sequel, and one that actually has a fair deal going on with it that makes it superior to the original. One of the better elements here is the film's rather emphasized use of suspense after the complete and utter dropping of comedy that ruined the original, which allows those scenes to be all the better. With the frantic scramble around campus to find the intended killer using only the cell-phone usage on campus to identify the caller, the killer appearing amongst a horde of similarly-costumed individuals in a play to a merely breathless escape from an incapacitated police car with the killer in the front seat and no other way out but over them is just a few of the truly spectacular sequences pulled off here that makes this one a lot more creepy and chilling than the original. Also on strong support is a nice body count that supplies some nice gore, some truly clever and original turns in the storyline that not only expand the original as well but provide enough to keep you guessing at this one, and when added together with some fine stalking scenes and excellent use of a school campus to set up some scares, it's got a lot to love. What isn't impressive is the killer's motive, which is an absolute travesty and a complete joke as to its inclusion, it just reeks of trying to be relevant to the times and offers nothing but ridicule, but otherwise this is a solid and utterly enjoyable entry.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Don't Expect the First,"Good things: At no point did this movie feel dumb or forced. The plot was very good and the acting was good as well. I enjoyed Gale and Dewey's expanding storyline as well as learning more about Sidney's past with Cotton. The actors I liked in particular were Jamie Kennedy, reprising his role of Randy with much enthusiasm and just plain good acting, and the acting of the killer/killers (I won't reveal who), was just as good as the first installment. The movie was again very satirical, like a Scream movie should be. Also, I cannot stress this enough, the character development is phenomenal. There are two deaths in particular in the movie where I definitely felt something. Not necessarily because the deaths were brutal (which they were) but because I actually felt something for the characters.Things that were lacking: It was supposed to be more violent and gory, but I don't feel that it was. At times the chase scenes with the killer got kind of boring, in my opinion. I felt the suspense was a little different, and the movie itself didn't feel like a classic horror movie like the first and it didn't feel like the first movie either. But I guess we shouldn't expect it to. As a fan of the first one, the second one might be a little disappointing but is still definitely worth a watch as an entry to this fantastic franchise.I won't give this an 8 because I don't feel that it's quite an 8.

Highly Entertaining Sequel,"Scream 2 (1997)*** (out of 4)Two years after the events in the previous film, a movie named ""Stab"", based on those events, is about to be released and sure enough Sidney (Neve Campbell) and her friends find themselves being stalked by a new ghost face killer. SCREAM worked so well because it knew it was a horror movie, knew the clichés and knew how to have fun with it. There's no question this sequel was made to cash-in on the success of the first film but thankfully screenwriter Kevin Williamson also knows this and keeps the fun going. There's a terrific sequence early in the film where some film students discuss the good and bad to sequels and we've got Randy (Jamie Kennedy) giving us the rules to survive a sequel. This all adds up to a winning film even if it falls somewhat short of the original. Williamson's screenplay certain makes the mystery deeper and adds some higher quality death scenes but perhaps one of the most interesting aspects doesn't get covered as funny as it could have been. I think the movie would have been better had they toned down some of the culture references and instead took a closer look at violence in movies and how it might relate to violence in the real world. This is touch on briefly and even is motivation for one of the killers. Those who were old enough to remember when this film was in the theater will remember some copycat killers of the first film so it's clear that both the screenwriter and director are stating their opinion that you can't blame movies. It's just too bad this wasn't explored a little bit more. As with the first film, the cast hit all the right marks with Campbell perfect as the victim and and we also get fine performances from Liev Schreiber and Kennedy. Sarah Michelle Gellar makes a cameo appearance but it's David Arquette and Courteney Cox who easily steal the film as Dewey and Gale Weathers. The two of them had remarkable chemistry in the film film and that carries over here as their playful banter just adds to the fun. The death scenes here are more violent than in the first film but they'll all well handled by Craven who certainly hasn't forgotten how to stage a scene. The highlight of the film is a sequence where Sidney and her friend are trapped in the back of a police car with the killer in the front seat passed out. The two girls have to try and crawl over him to freedom and this here is Craven at his very best as he milks the scene for every inch of suspense. I think the identity of the killer isn't as good as in the first film because there doesn't seem to be much intent on the ""mystery"" being a big aspect here. Of course they don't want you to figure out but when the killer or killers are finally revealed you realize there wasn't much rhyme or reason and that they could have picked anyone. While SCREAM 2 isn't a masterpiece it is rare as sequels usually aren't that good. This certainly isn't as good as the original but it's a good way to continue the story.",,Anonymous,Horror
"""By definition alone, sequels are inferior films!""","FILM: 7.5/10.Scream 2 arrived on the scene only a year after its predecessor, following the great commercial and critical success of the first film. While it doesn't quite reach the same lofty heights as its predecessor, it manages to be one of the better horror sequels out there.This time, the film continues to build on the story of the original, keeping the audience guessing about the identity of the new Ghostface killer. The concept remains sharp, and the film's dialogue is a high point, filled with wit and self-awareness. Director Wes Craven knows when to embrace the cheeky side of the genre, and that's part of the fun.The melodrama sometimes veers into cheesy territory, and the storyline occasionally relies on convenient twists. However, Craven's adept direction keeps the film engaging.One of the highlights of Scream 2 is the expanded cast. Jamie Kennedy's return as Randy is a treat, and newcomers like Timothy Olyphant deliver solid performances. The chemistry among the returning and new cast members is palpable, which adds to the film's charm. Once again, David Arquette's Dewey is the highlight.The addition of Stab, the film within a film, adds an extra layer of satire and self-awareness to the story. While it may be cheesy, Robert Rodriguez's work on these scenes is effective. It's a nod to the audience's familiarity with the horror genre and the original Scream.Scream 2 is a worthy sequel, a rarity in the horror genre. While it might not surpass the original, it successfully maintains the essence of what made Scream so fresh and enjoyable. It's a horror film that doesn't take itself too seriously, making it an entertaining and clever follow-up.FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-rayVIDEO: 9/10.Native 4K presentation, Detail level: Excellent, Colour reproduction: Excellent, Level accuracy: Excellent, Encode: Excellent, Master condition: GoodAUDIO: 9/10.DTS-HD MA 5.1 audio, Dialogue reproduction: Excellent, Soundtrack & effects clarity: Excellent, Dynamics: Good, Surround sound presentation: Excellent, LFE content: ExcellentMOOFIEMETER: 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Scream 2"" (1997) - A Worthy Sequel with Sharp Wit","""Scream 2,"" released just a year after the original in 1997, is a sequel that defies the odds by living up to its predecessor's high standards. Directed by Wes Craven and written by Kevin Williamson, the film continues the story of Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), who now finds herself in college, trying to move on from the horrors of Woodsboro. However, the past catches up with her as a new Ghostface killer emerges, targeting Sidney and her friends once again.One of the strengths of ""Scream 2"" is its awareness of the perils of sequels. The film openly discusses the ""rules"" of sequels, often with a humorous and critical eye, while still delivering the suspense and thrills that made the first film a success. The meta-commentary remains sharp, with the film delving into the notion that sequels are often bigger, bloodier, and more intense, which ""Scream 2"" certainly delivers.Neve Campbell once again excels as Sidney, bringing depth to a character who is now more cautious and traumatized but still resilient. Courteney Cox and David Arquette return as Gale Weathers and Dewey Riley, respectively, providing continuity and further developing their characters. The dynamic between these three leads continues to be a highlight of the series.The film's ensemble cast also includes new faces like Timothy Olyphant, Jerry O'Connell, and Sarah Michelle Gellar, all of whom contribute to the film's tension and body count. The plot is more complex, with multiple red herrings and twists that keep the audience guessing until the final reveal, which, while not as shocking as the first film's, is still effective.""Scream 2"" does suffer from a few pacing issues and moments where it feels like it's trying a bit too hard to outdo the original. However, it successfully maintains the suspense and self-referential humor that made ""Scream"" such a hit, making it a worthy and entertaining sequel that honors the original while exploring new ground.Overall, ""Scream 2"" is a strong continuation of the franchise, delivering more scares, more laughs, and more clever commentary on the horror genre. It's a rare sequel that not only matches but, in some ways, enhances the experience of the original.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Scream 2: neither worse nor better than Scream,"Scream 2: neither worse nor better than Scream
Directed by Wes Craven, with the cast of actors Neve Campbell (Sidney), Courtney Cox (Gale), David Arquette (Dewey) and Liev Schreiber (Cotton). They all participated playing the same characters in the first film.Scream (1996) sequel, conceived and also directed by Wes Craven.It's more of the same in relation to the first film, because the core of the script is the same. This sequence makes fun of the first Scream and other successful horror films of the 1980s, such as, in line to enter the cinema, which premiered Stab, based on the events that occurred in the first film, a black couple engages in dialogue , when Maureen (Jada Pinkett Smith) says that horror film has the same characteristics, with white women being attacked and murdered by a mentally disturbed serial killer, that there was never a black character victimized by this killer.As in the first film, there are many references to Hollywood hits, but not just from the horror genre. There is a debate in a film class whose theme was movie sequences that were blockbusters. The question was whether there was any better sequel than the one that spawned it. Several answers, most, in my view, pertinent. Among those mentioned are Aliens, Terminator 2, and best of all, The Godfather 2.Scream 2 also offers hints/spoilers for scenes that take place throughout the film itself. In a dialogue between Dewey and Randy (Jamie Kennedy) there are hints about the identity of the serial killer, which will only be revealed in the final scenes.For me, this sequel is on the same level as the first film, no better, no worse.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Not bad yet not favourite Scream movie,"Quite a popular horror movie sequel, better than Scream 3 but not as great as Scream 4. Obviously gets the bronze medal in my ranking of Scream movie franchise.Shouldn't have that godawful cafeteria scene nobody asked for or wanted , might not want to give details of who Ghostface killers were in this one, yet first one revealed is totally one of the worst Ghostface killer, ridiculous motive in blaming movies want to get caught and go to trial, seriously?!! The other one, and genuine killer, more reasonable even might have only killed Randy as he insulted Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.And this movie got some poor character choices of whatever call it, like when Sidney escapes the police car by crawling over Ghostface, whilst unconscious, instead of ample opportunity to unmask or choke him out. Quite a tense moment like holding your breath waiting for jump scare, still poor character decision.Cast: like I mentioned pretty Neve Campbell and Courteney Cox, David Arquette/Dewey (screw him!), additions of Timothy Olyphant as Mickey, Laurie Metcalf as straight up crazy lady, and as had Matthew Lillard (Shaggy) in previous movie, in this one there's Sarah Michelle Gellar (Daphne Blake) not much long screen time.At least Neve Campbell and Courteney Cox both look attractively beautiful in this movie. Sidney giving looks of trust issues when boyfriend Derek was injured, even useless Dewey throwing suspicion of his courageous act. Speaking of which, why killed off Randy instead of Dewey?!!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Not so different,"This movie is very similar to the original.I think the cliches used in the past one, and how they make fun of it, and doing the same in this one is very repetitive. The story takes a long time to be exciting, only in the second part of the film you feel the fear of the protagonists, although the story feels a bit forced, it convinces. There are not many new things in this sequel, there are even fewer gory scenes and fewer funny moments.The movie doesn't quite manage to be on the level of the original, but it does have decent and entertaining parts.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Ehhhhn. . .,"Well, I thought the first movie was great, but this one falls quite short of the mark.  Although this installment of the tragic life of Sydney Prescott has its moments (such as the great allusions to Greek literature), it has a relatively weak story.  Basically a dilapidated repeat of the first script, the movie relies on gore and ""startle shots"" rather than plot and suspense, two characteristics which made the original Scream stand out from other horror movies.  For instance, the killers (I won't reveal them here) end up being extremely minor and undeveloped characters whom the audience has not suspected at all in the first place.  In a good ""whodunit,"" the person watching should at first suspect the killer, and then be manipulated into dismissing this thought as too obvious.  The person should then flail about wildly suspecting everyone until the real killer is revealed, completely shocking them.  Instead, Scream 2 simply sells itself with more gore and throws in the most predictable killer.  For the killer's partner, Scream 2 chooses to nearly introduce an entirely new character.  Now, how is the audience supposed to suspect, be nervous about, and therefore terrified of a character they do not know in the first place?  With rumors of a third Scream surfacing, my advice to Wes Craven is this:  Quit while you are ahead, or rather, not too extremely far behind.",,Anonymous,Horror
not a worthy sequel but not a bad film,"Scream 2 is an odd film to say the least, it in no way lives up to the first film but is not a completely terrible film. After watching this film recently (having not seen it in several years) I was left feeling confused about the movie.Having Sid at college is a great settling for a slasher film, it has creepy corridors, college parties, loads of suspects and much more elements that could be used, but the film doesn't seem to utilises them well enough.The film didn't have the same sort of scares that the first film included, the scare scenes in this film just don't feel as they did in the first. The movie also fails on doing what made the first film so brilliant which was the nod to previous slashers and horror movies, it became less of a parody and more of the many films the original Scream was poking fun at.However saying all this the film still has its up sides, there are some great scenes within the film and some of them are quite remember able. I personally felt that in some of the cool scenes there is much room for improvement and that they could of done so much with them. It does have its moments and there is one scene that is sort of moving in its own way but not much more then that.Scream 2 is good if your looking to put something on with a couple of mates thats fun and has its jumpy moments as well but thats all it is while the first one was fun to watch with friends but was really cleaver.In conclusion Scream 2 isn't the best of Scream films but it includes some great moments and as always unpredictable Killer/Killers.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pretty good sequel,"The funny thing with 'Scream 2' is that it's not as entertaining and good as 'Scream' but with bad movies like 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' and 'Urban Legend' it's kind of a relieve. Probably the difference here is that Wes Craven is a director who knows what he is doing.Neve Campbell as Sidney, Courteney Cox as Gale Weathers, David Arquette as Deputy Dewey and Jamie Kennedy as Randy return for this sequel. New possible subjects or suspects are Cici (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Hallie (Elise Neal), Sidney's new boyfriend Derek (Jerry O'Connell), former suspect Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) who was in prison for a year, Mickey (Timothy Olyphant) and reporter Debbie Salt (Laurie Metcalf) who is a big fan of Gale.The movie opens in a theater. The movie 'Stab' is showing for the first time and this movie is based on the book 'The Woodsboro Murders' by Gale Weathers. In 'Scream' Sidney predicted that Tori Spelling would probably play her if they would ever make a movie about those events and in 'Scream 2' we learn she was right. It is one of the many funny little things. Jada Pinkett Smith and Omar Epps are killed during the showing and of course the movie is blamed.From here it is like 'Scream'. The guessing can begin. Again it is a lot of fun, again the movie knows that it must not get too serious, again I was entertained by what I saw. 'Scream' was original and therefore better, more entertaining and more surprising in the way the subject was handled. Still, with all the inside jokes and references this is a lot of fun and a lot better than almost every other movie in the genre.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Pastiche & Parody That's Just As Classic As The Original.,"With an absolute allstar 90's cast...Wes Craven's follow up to his original classic is a very solid sequel.All the survivors from the first film are back for this installment: Neve Campbell as Sidney; Courtney Cox as Gail Weathers; David Arquette as Deputy Dewey; Jamie Kennedy as horror buff Randy Meeks; and even Liev Schreiber as Cotton Weary, the original suspect in the murder of Sidney's mother.With new members of the cast including Sarah Michelle Geller as Cici; Jerry O'Connell as Derek. And Laurie Metcalfe as Debbie Salt.Alongside guest appearances from Omar Epps; Jada Pinkett(-Smith); Timothy Olyphant; Rebecca Gayheart; Joshua Jackson; Tori Spelling; and Luke Wilson.After Gail Weathers writes a book about the case, a film is made, which garners itself a cult following.And inspires an era of copycat killers, to take over where the previous killers had failed.The fact that there is a film about the film within the film, reveals to us, as viewers, that the whole thing is going to have a self reflexive element.Allowing it to play upon itself as a sequel.Craven adds some depth to this by including commentary about the obsessive nature of toxic fandom, and the influence of media violence on real life...a couple of debates that were playing themselves out at the time.On top of this. He also makes a load of references to popular tv shows of the era, like Friends and Saved By The Bell...whose fans might be drawn to this film, for obvious reasons.As well as slasher films in which college students are targeted.He also cleverly incorporates modern technology (of the time) into the storyline...with cell phones and intranet instant messaging used to facilitate jump scares (I counted seven jump scare attempts, by the way).But the real brilliance of the Scream films is derived from the fact that they are both a pastiche- with Craven being a student of the master of mystery, Argento, himself- and a parody, at the same time.Not only of slasher films in general, but also of themselves.Which explains the cheese factor they include...as they aren't meant to be consumed in a completely serious manner.Craven really does a good job of emulating Argento in this film, seeming to have taken particular influence from The Bird With The Crystal Plumage- where one killer is veiled, while the other killer is really quite obvious.Obfuscating the answer to the mystery with the fact that there is actually a set of killers, rather than a lone murderer.As far as sequels go...this one is really quite excellent.Having garnered a reputation as being just as classic as the original.A really solid job by Craven, as always.6.5 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Incredible sequel,"This is a rarity--a sequel that doesn't suck! This takes place a few years after ""Scream"". Sidney (Neve Campbell) is in college still recovering from virtually all her friends being killed years before. Then a movie called ""Stab"" opens that is a fictional account of what happened. Then the murders start happening again centered around Sidney. GREAT sequel with a wonderful script, mostly great acting and plenty of action. The body count has been upped, the killings are more brutal and bloody and this film is very scary. There is humor of course but it takes a back seat to horror. Well-directed by Wes Craven too.There's only two problems. One is David Arquette. He's TERRIBLE in his role. He appears drugged out. The second is the killer seems to magically teleport himself to where his victims are. This happens at least three times in the course of the film! Still, if you're a horror film like me, you learn how to totally suspend your disbelief and go with it. A fast, funny and bloody sequel. Avoid ""Scream 3"" at all costs.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Part 2 of more screams and slashing.,"This is the sequel to one of the definite slasher movies, where two years after the events of ""Scream,"" Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) and Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy) are trying to get on with their lives and are students at Windsor College. When Gale Weathers' (Courteney Cox) novel ""The Woodsboro Murders"" turned into the film, ""Stab,"" of series of killings occur and GhostFace returns. Soon, the stalking, phone calls and screams occur again.Filmed in a college setting, the actors did provide another believable and serious performance, providing enough drama and suspense to make the horror film watchable and tense. Scary scenes with the killer chasing the victims left and right and the victims hiding and trying to escape from the unseen killer will send chills down your spine and cover your ears to prevent you from being creeped out at those jumping-out-at-you moments, which are more in abundance than in the previous film; the part where Sidney creeps up to the car to see if the unmoving GhostFace character is dead or alive.With these teen-flick types of horror movies, it has its fair share of corny and lame moments. Sarah Michelle Gellar is my favorite actor, though, in the movie and she took on a role similar to that of Drew Barrymorre in the previous film, engaging, suspenseful and memorable. But, her cynical and determined attitude give the plot more excitement. Overall, not a bad horror sequel.Grade B-",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

A disappointing sequel,"The problem with this film is that after the original that showed up some of the cliches in horror films, this seems to be trying to invent its own.

The first killing in the original was very well executed, and convincing, but in this, the first killing is poorly executed and unconvincing, although the idea behind it is quite good.This film is probably worth watching, but does not have the spark of originality that the original had.

Scream Louder The Second Time,"Wes Craven is back with Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, David Arquette and Jamie Kennedy for the sequel of slasher spoof 'Scream'. This time the film pokes fun at the slasher sequels where the twists and turns are more absurd and silly and with more deathcounts. The team does a successful job and just like in the first movie the element of suspense and humour is fused together very well. The new cast includes Omar Epps, Jada Pinkett Smith, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Liev Schreiber (who did have a smaller role in the first movie), Jerry O'Connell, Timothy Olifant, Laurie Metcalf, Marisol Nichols, Portia de Rossi and Rebecca Gayheart and they contribute well. The latter two are particularly hilarious as they parody sorority sluts. Now I won't reveal which ones get butchered and which ones survive for that is best left to the viewer but Craven and his team have succeeded yet again in parodying the subgenre. Some may argue that it is less clever compared to the first but that's the point because sequels usually are sillier than their predecessors and the final revelation here is hilarious. On the technical side, music is effectively used and the camera-work does its trick. The sets are also quite impressive, particularly in the theatre scene.It's silly alright but thankfully not as far-fetched as in the fourth movie. Let's see what the third one has in store.",,Anonymous,Horror

it didn't come to me as a horror movie,
we can see the consequences of the events of the first film,
what happened to the characters after the traumatic event and etc ...

Worthy Successor,"Do you know what I realized while watching the franchise? I hadn't watched a single horror movie that ""Scream"" is making fun of... okay, now that I think about it, maybe there is one - ""Halloween""... fine, maybe there's another one - ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" (but it was so long time ago that it's almost doesn't count), but that's it. Maybe, just maybe, if I had been an active viewer of this genre in the 80s-early 90s, I would appreciate ""Scream's"" approach much more (not to say I didn't appreciate the approach - I appreciated it but there's always room for more). The funny thing is, even though ""Scream"" was making fun of movies released BEFORE its own release (duh), you would think all the tropes and cliches would simply dissappear from at least the majority of top-tier horror movies released afterward, but considering the fact I was familiar with all the cliches the franchise was mocking, while not having watched a lot of horrors from that era, means I recognized the cliches because they are STILL present in much newer movies, released AFTER the original ""Scream"". This, in turn, suggests that no one really learned anything.Okay, back to the movie. ""Scream 2"" is as good as the original - it truly felt like an organic continutation of the story and definitely didn't feel like a forced one.

"""Gail Weathers reporting!""","I think I like this one just as much as the first. It still has that tongue in cheek humour and doesn't take itself very seriously at all and you still start off with no idea who the killer is and actually, I could only remember part of the ending, so I still managed to be surprised.What I think is good about this one is that once again we are faced with a list of people that could be the serial killer/s (After all, there was two last time, why not three of four this time, or is it in her head, is she dreaming, is it a real ghost?).
There are the ones returning from the original film- Sidney, who could have lost the plot after her trauma and become a psycho? Gail, who might be trying to get her book to the bestsellers list? Randy, who might be trying to prove a point about horror movies and their sequels? And Officer Dewie, who may have decided that he's sick of having the piss taken out of him?
Add to that a new Cameraman, Policeman, College Professor, Buffy The Vampire Slayer News Reporters, The Fat Kid from Stand By Me, Ellen's Girlfriend and her eyebrows, College Friends, Sidney's absent father or dead mother, who could still come back from the grave? And you are spoilt for choice and let's not forget of course, Cotton Weary, who has just been released from prison and would probably have a little grudge against Sid for putting him there.Once again, it is fast paced and witty.

Not as clever as it thinks it is,"With the original murders now made into a best selling book and film, someone on campus begins to kill in the same way as before. As Sidney's (Campbell) friends begin to die off suspicion seems to point to all those round her.I didn't really like the first Scream - I thought it was clever but that it revelled in it's own cruelty. Here the same problems exist. This wants to be a teen slasher movie but also be clever and look down it's nose at other slashers. It starts with the movie within a movie and uses that to make jokes out of all the things that were thrown at it first time round - causing real life violence, having no black people etc and of course it gets to discuss the rules for horror sequels and make fun of those. My problem with this is that it wants to laugh at slasher movies but also do the very things it's laughing at. This may be good once but twice and the joke wears thin, also when it is dealing with real-life issues rather than film 'rules' it is harder to swallow and misses the mark.For example Jada Pinkett derides the film Stab for being ""a white film"" and having ""no black people"" etc, just like the first Scream. But you get the feeling that this joke is a sore spot because now we have several black leads in the film even when a group of white sorority girls are onscreen they will contain a token black character. The colour shouldn't be an issue, but by pointing it out and then ensuring that Scream 2 has plenty it makes you think all the black actors are there jut to make up a quota. It's the same in other areas - the opening murders in the cinema are meant to make us look at this crowd enjoying on-screen murder watch as Pinkett is killed. We're supposed to see how macabre it is that the audience loves the onscreen violence and then see how abhorrent Pinkett's terror-filled gruesome death is.....but then we (the audience) sit and get entertained by the violence and killing that follows. I do feel that the film can't have it both ways - say ""look at this isn't it terrible"" and proceed to do just what it was making fun of.If horror is your thing then this is quite good. It has plenty of scares and jumps but it is just too cruel to be entertaining - it seems to not take fun from the excitement or the horror but from the sheer cruelty of the murders. It's not as scary as the first and most of the time you know what's going to happen - which is why the film ups the gore and cruelty of the killings - to give us something new and interesting. Outside of this the plot is funny at times but it isn't as self-referential as before. The best bits involve in-jokes among the cast such as Cox's character responding to nude internet pictures of her by saying it was just her head put onto Jennifer Anniston's body. But for the most part the mystery plot is silly and you do just sit and watch good-looking teens get picked off for 2 hours. The eventual twist is stupid - as one of the characters says ""Wow! What a twist! bet you didn't see that coming!"" Well, no - but only because the twist is so unpredictable that it's stupid. The film spends so much time making all the characters look suspicious and putting EVERYONE in a situation where they could be the killer, only to then go and do that!The original cast all return with the addition of several black faces to even it up (Pinkett, Epps, Elise Neal and others) and a few famous TV faces (Buffy's Gellar, Ally McBeal's Portia de Rossi, Laurie Metcalf) all do well as the killer's victims. The film appears to be more carefree about killing it's main cast but bottles it at the end and makes sure it's got enough left over for a sequel. David Arquette and his wife have the most fun but other leads such as Gellar and Campbell just run around screaming with not much else to do until they die or confront the killer. Sad that the most beautiful woman in this only lasts 5 minutes (Pinkett) before being dispatched, Omar Epps deserved more than he got as well - but I guess the film isn't quite as equal opps as it would like to think.Overall a horror movie that replaces scares with cruelty and insults us all by making us think that we can figure it all out before screwing us with an ending that comes out of nowhere. The cast were not shown the ending until the end of shooting but I feel that if they had they wouldn't have been able to rehearse with a straight face.",,Anonymous,Horror
All you needed was just a little bit more meta and you had a masterpiece,"By continuing a meta franchise this movie falls a bit flat on its own ideas and overall concept.

Scream 2 is decently a horror sequel, something that feels inferior to its original lightening in a bottle, but it really didn´t have to be.2 years after the murders that haunted a small town and especially Sidney Prescott, a new copycat killer is out for blood, once again dawning the Ghostface mask.What this movie does well is the chemistry between characters and the overall acting is great. It´s fun to see these characters again and it carries over how much we cared for them in the original movie. This is the strong suite of the movie, creating actual tension for some of your favourite characters to die.The movies social commentary moments and overall commenting in the horror movie genre is not as strong here and it feels like the self-awareness of the original movie isn´t as strong here. The only thing the movie seems to acknowledge is all the bad aspects of a sequel and all the tropes of a horror sequel, but actually calling them bad and when you then lean into that, you are not being clever, you are making a not fun movie. This movie runs way too long. We have too many characters set up and to kill so the movie uses most of its runtime to not really do much.Another aspect I feel like the movie fails at is the twist ending it´s borrowing from its predecessor. The villain isn´t that much of a twist, more than it is just surprising who it is. Trying to double down like this is just not working that well for the movie.But what I see here is a movie full of potential. Instead of just briefly talking about sequels the movie should have made it its identity. This should have been a movie about someone trying to make a real life Scream sequel which is kind of what it wants to do to begin with but kind of trails away from. Stick with that and you have an actually interesting movie! But the movies idea and concept is still fun overall.Scream 2 will never be the original Scream (1996) but it was never supposed to be that. This movie is good but is frustrating on so many levels because it could have been on par with the original. This is just a fun slasher movie and that´s about it.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The same as the original?,"scream 2 is very very much like the original which i suppose is what they were trying to do, to carry on from the first movie's success. Without giving anything away the people who get killed and the people who do the killing are very predictable as is the whole movie.It was not that bad though , i just hope they dont make a scream 3 because they have just about exhausted the story line. 6 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Almost just as good as the first until the final twist,"The first hour and half are only slightly worse than the first movie, but the final act of this movie is considerably worse than the great twist in the first movie.

"""Scream 2""- Despite lacking that lightning-in-a-bottle freshness captured flawlessly by the original, this stellar sequel is another win!  A fantastic riff on horror sequels!","It's odd how some films in retrospect were clearly ahead of their time. While the original ""Scream"" is undeniably a classic of both its time and the horror genre as a whole, it's hard not to notice that its stellar first sequel ""Scream 2"" doesn't command nearly the same level of respect with audiences despite garnering similar critical acclaim. And I do think that in a way, it's because ""Scream 2"" was ahead of its time.How so? It championed and furthered many elements introduced in the original, and fully realizes the potential of some of the elements introduced by its predecessor. Most notable- ""Scream 2"" is one of the most delightfully ""meta"" mainstream films I've seen but it was released about a decade before the whole ""meta"" concept became a ""thing"" that audiences recognized. While today, you can throw a rock and hit something that could be construed (or misconstrued) as ""meta"" not so much back in the 90's. I know a lot of people who saw ""Scream 2"" and its larger focus on meta back in the day as the film just being ""confusing"" or ""sillier"" or ""weird."" Yes, the first film had a lot of meta elements, but it wasn't until this sequel that director Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson really went to town and had fun with it.And I think that it went right over a lot of audience's heads when it came out. But especially looking back now, it's easier to see just why this second go is almost as good as the original, and how this stronger focus on self-aware meta storytelling was a great direction to go. Hell, I think it could be argued it even exceeds the original in some ways.The film's opening perfectly establishes this hyper-meta tonality when we start at a public screening of ""Stab""- a movie- within-the-movie, based loosely on the events of the original film. It's at this premier that a new ""Ghostface"" emerges, and takes out a couple film-goers in an opening kill that in my opinion matches the shocking iconic start of the original.Sidney Prescott is now attending college with friend and fellow- survivor Randy, and upon hearing of the new murders, they immediately become suspicious and go on-guard. After being re- united with Dewey and Gale and helping introduce the audience to the newcomer characters, it becomes another fight-for-survival as the new ""Ghostface"" targets our returning heroes, seemingly in an attempt to make a ""real-life sequel"" to the events of the original film.Like the original, the heart of this follow-up is writer Kevin Williamson's wonderful screenplay. As mentioned above, Williamson dives into full-blown ""meta"" territory here, raising the stakes, the laughs and the scares to new level, but always grounded in a self-aware fashion. He also makes the wise choice of giving the returning characters just enough moments of serious character development without bogging down the fast-pacing or feeling out of place. It's one of the most solid scripts for a horror sequel I think has ever been written. And if one pays attention, you can even see Williamson subtly planting the seeds for future sequels and where it may take the story, though done with a sense of class that doesn't just make it feel like sequel-baiting. (It's just a shame the Williamson-less ""Scream 3"" didn't pay off on these concepts) I do believe that on the whole, the writing for this film is cleverer and wittier than the original.Craven of course returns, and just as in the original, his classy sense of visual storytelling and direction helps convey the themes, ideas and of course the gags and scares in expert fashion. With the film going as self-aware as it did, I think that in less capable hands, it could have ventured into cartoonish territory. Thankfully, Craven and his confidence in the material keep it from going there, so it's still a blast of fun and has a good sense of tonal continuity with the original.This film also solidifies that the series cast is just wonderful. Neve Campbell is a revelation in this film and brings more life and pathos to her character. Other returning players such as Jamie Kennedy are a ton of fun. Courtney Cox and David Arquette once again steal the show. And newcomers like Jerry O'Connell and Sarah Michelle Gellar fit right in. The best new addition, however, is definitely Liev Schreiber as Cotton Weary, the man Sidney originally suspected of killing her mother before learning this wasn't the case in the original film. Schreiber is a blast as a sort-of sniveling man who is trying to cash-in on his media infamy by forcing Sidney into interviews with him for the news in a hope to gain a bit of fame. It's a very fun part, and Schreiber plays it very well.However, unlike the original... there are some flaws. And they're what's keeping this just shy of getting a perfect 10. And those flaws almost entirely pertain to the script, as despite the level of cleverness and wit displayed by Williamson's writing, it's got some issues. Most notably that it seems Williamson painted himself into a corner more than once, leading to a few awkward scenes where instead of creatively subverting audience expectations like he did in the original... he relied on the horror cliche's and tropes he spent the entire last film lampooning. (A scene inside of a car involving a knocked-out ""Ghostface"" is a prime example.)These moments are just too contrary to the other, much better written scenes to ignore, so I have to knock off a point.However, despite these problems, ""Scream 2"" is another winner. It's furiously entertaining, wickedly creative and simultaneously humorous and horrifying.A near-perfect 9 out of 10, and a fine example of a sequel-done- right!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Come on its not that bad,Now we all know that its not as great as the classic first. But this movie is a lot better than most people say. In my opinion I thought that this movie had almost as many great scares and laughs as the first. At some points it drags on a little but for the most part it proves to be very entertaining. More great performances from Campbell and Kennedy. Like all the other slasher movies each sequel is a little harder to believe that another killer wants the same person dead for a whole other reason but once you get past that this movie will give you a great ride. Once again Wes Craven brings you a movie that full of thrills and laughs. In my opinion its definitely worth spending a few bucks on if you liked the first one.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror

cinematography masterpiece but full of flaws,Scream 2 is definitely a lot of people's highlights for the scream franchise as it features a somewhat interesting new set of teenage characters loveable adults from the original and a compelling story similar to the original.What makes Scream 2 just so much more interesting than the original is its beauty in keeping the viewer thinking. Its amazing work at sound queues and cinematography leads you to think things that may or may not be true. It's the classic trick on the viewer that causes you into thinking something is what it isn't and Scream 2 executes this perfectly. I really didn't expect what happened next most of the time and that's what's done amazingly.Though the movie is amazing at being a horror film it also feels like something else. The movie gets to a point where the horror aspect of it is completely gone and simply guns and action are the only way they proceed within the story.Although the characters were joking about the sequels always needing more violent and interesting deaths Scream 2 didn't shout unique. Most of the slasher aspects in the film are stock standard compared to most slashers.Overall Scream 2 is a decent sequel and deserves praise for doing the franchise justice though it doesn't hold up to the original perfectly.,6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Not as good as the first, but still good","Not the best Scream movie, but not the worst. I think we all should give it a chance, a real chance. It might not be ,,cinema,, but it s still an iconic franchise that inspired the upcoming horror- comedy movies and not only.There were many references about the first movie used in the sequel of Scream and I was pretty impressed by them, so when they did or said something that some people would call it ,, a clishé,, , it did in fact have a meaning behind it. Anyway, Scream 2 is not as good as the first movie from the franchise. One thing that I found it pretty surprising it s that I felt like in this movie we didn t get the chance to see Ghostface that much and also, in fact, he didn t have that many victims.

the proof - sequels suck,"well, maybe it wasn't that bad. but compared to part 1, the original 'scream' it seems quite lame. part 1 had brilliant characters and really brilliant actors (matthew lillard, rose mcgowan,..) so in part 2 there's just something missing. besides with all the well-known actors who appear in scream 2 you'll just go - 'hey that's the buffy actress' and 'there's the guy from dawson's creek' and so on.. you know, somewhat ruins the movie. at least, with me. still, i'd give it 5 out of 10 stars.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Oedipus not the king.,"Still fun: it was never going to live up to the original, but its remarkable how shoddy this sequel is.  The comedy is minimised in favour of excessive violence, which, because the script avoids building up character, has, ironically, less impact than the original.  The early dispatch of Sarah Michelle Gellar without giving her anything to do is criminal, while Neve Campbell's inexpressivity is almost Franjuesque.  The amusingly pretentious references to Greek theatre add to the spirit of play and do give force to the film's best scene, when Gail watches Dewey (as Oedipus) being attacked.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Good Follow Up to a Modern Classic,"I first watched this film when it came on VHS. I enjoyed the original and was excited that they made a sequel. It didn't hurt the previous was one of my favorite films at the time. Something that I appreciated was that they also brought back a lot of characters as well. This is one that I've seen quite a few times throughout the years. There was a long stretch where I hadn't. I did see this with an ex-girlfriend and some of my friends. Jaime didn't know if she had seen this so we watched together.Synopsis: taking place two years after the first series of murders as Sydney (Neve Campbell) acclimates to college life, someone dons the Ghostface costume begins a new string of killings.This sequel is quite interesting in that it takes the meta feel to the next level. The events for the first film have been made into a movie. A sneak peek is being shown at a theater by a college. We follow a couple, Maureen (Jada Pinkett Smith) and Phil (Omar Epps), as they go, even though she doesn't like horror films. Phil seems to love them. I like that Maureen gives her reasons to hate them which are valid to an extent. Black people don't normal survive long and woman aren't portrayed the best either. Being a bit more seasoned, I don't fully believe these now, but it isn't completely wrong. This couple is murdered, which gives an interesting look at the horror audience that the theater goers think it is a publicity stunt. They are cheering for the deaths on screen and for the death that is happening before them. It takes them time to realize it is real. Going back to the meta, it is ironic that Maureen's fears become true as well.We then shift over to Sydney in her dorm. We see that she gets a lot of prank calls. It appears they're getting worse with the film coming out. Hallie (Elise Neal) is her roommate and is concerned, to the point of seeing if they need to change their number again. When they hear about the murders, Sydney seeks out her friend, Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy), who is in film class. It there is that we get an intriguing debate about sequels with Cici (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Mickey (Timothy Olyphant) and an unnamed character played by Joshua Jackson. What sparked it is the idea of blaming the movie for what happened at the theater.The killer then stalks Sydney and there is a pattern to the murders that involves the events from the first. Sydney starts to wonder who it could be. There are possible suspects all around her like her new boyfriend, Derek (Jerry O'Connell), or the man she thought killed her mother, Cotton Weary (Live Schreiber). Randy even considers people like her new roommate as potential suspect. Things don't get easier when Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox), Debbie Salt (Laurie Metcalf) and other reporters hound her. Dewey Riley (David Arquette) is also there to try to help her.That is where I'll leave my recap and introducing our characters. Where I'll start is that I find this as an interesting continuation of the meta-aspects and expanding how sequels change the rules that the previous established. As a horror film fan, some of the things Randy said are spot on. They normally are bloodier, higher body counts and expand on the story that was set forth in the previous film. At least the good ones do. We get that here. There is a reveal that I won't spoil for those that might not have seen it. I did find this to be a little bit unbelievable though. It was good that Sydney points this out, but I do believe they were on the screen together at one point, so I don't get how it doesn't happen earlier. It could be a plot-hole, but after this viewing, I'm not sure I can hold it against the movie.On the other side though, I love what the reason that these killings are happening. There is an excuse that plays off what the previous film was trying to refute, but it was also something that was prominent in the news. Heck, we still see it at times as a defense. Personally, I disagree with the argument, but the killer doesn't even believe it outside of an excuse. It also is interesting that they want to go to trial for their 20 minutes of fame. This is even more relevant today as I think that is partially the reason for a lot of mass killings we see.Shifting away I'd say that this is paced well, much like the previous one. The running time is again close to two hours, but it doesn't feel like it. The mystery was good, even though I didn't care for one of the reveals. For deepening the story of the franchise, I do like it as it adds another level. It isn't all that believable that no one would notice who the person was. The other one though was good. I do like how the film ends as it is fitting. I'd even say here that the cinematography was good. This was well shot.Moving then over to the acting, I thought was solid. Campbell is great in her role. This adds another dimension to her as she was a survivor from the last film. She doesn't know what to do or who to trust, but she is stronger from what she's already endured. I like what she does for the ending as well. Neal is fine as her new best friend. Schreiber is good in his minor role that he has. I thought that was creative to bring him back and then build on it. Kennedy is great again as he is me in my friend's group and I love his knowledge of the genre. It is good to have Cox and Arquette back as their characters growth that is good. I also want to shout-out the cameos by Gellar, Olyphant, Jackson, O'Connell, Rebecca Gayheart, Lewis Arquette, Portia de Rossi and Marisol Nichols. I'd say the acting was good across the board.Then the last things to go into would be with the other filmmaking aspects. I'd say that the effects looked good once again. They went practical again and it looks real enough. Since this is a slasher, they stick to kills mostly done by a knife. I'm fine with that as it is the iconic weapon for Ghostface. As for the soundtrack it lack a bit in comparison to what the original did. I do like some of the selections. They bring back one of the songs from the first film that I thought fit in well were used. I don't want you to think this hurts the movie. It just isn't as iconic for me.In conclusion, even though this one takes a step back, I think this is still good. I'm not the biggest fan of one of the reveals to this film, but I like how it adds to the story. As a sequel, I do think it builds on what the original did which is what I want. The pacing as well as the effects of this film are solid. The acting is good. I don't have issues with the soundtrack, it just didn't stick out as much. Overall, I'd also say this is solid and if you like the first one, then give this a watch. Its meta nature makes it self-aware and good for people who are fans of the genre as well as those who might not be as much.My Rating: 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Decent follow-up; on a par with the original,"Two years have passed by since the original killers donned the infamous Ghostface masks. Due to the notoriety of these killers, a film called Stab has been released which is based on the killings from the original film. Unfortunately the release of the film coincides with a copycat killer whom begins another murder spree...Inevitably, Scream 2 is going to lack the freshness of the first film (and even the concept of a person deciding to commit murders after being influenced by a film is not really a new idea either). That being said, Scream 2 is still a fairly decent offering...The reason it works is that you still have the same fun in trying to work out who or whom is doing the killings. I also thought that the pacing was better in this film (it got going much quicker and it had a little bit of claustrophobia about which made many of the scenes feel quite tense).Although I liked this film and the first film I'm loathed to rate either film much higher than a 6; the simple reason for this is that a loony going round chasing someone with a knife is not particularly scary to me (there's always a chance that the victim will get away and/or get the better of such a killer). I prefer psychological horror or horror where there is more of a sense of hopelessness for the victim's (Nightmare on Elm Street is a good example; a killer who kills you while you sleep; everyone needs to sleep which made that film have a hopeless feel about it).Still for what it is though, Scream is still a good film (though I would class it more as entertaining than scary. But if that's the point then fair enough). The acting is pretty good here (it seemed slightly better here than in the first film) and as I've already said it moves pretty fast and is never boring.If you liked the first film then you're gonna enjoy this sequel so it is something that I would recommend.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Right Place Wrong Time,"Continuing on with the ""Scream"" series, ahead of the fifth film out later this month, ""Scream 2"" which was released less than a year after the original, and in trying circumstances, is way more successful that it has any right to be.Having moved to college, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is preparing for the release of ""Stab"" a film based on Gale Weathers' (Courtney Cox) book about the original crime. When two of her classmates are murdered at a sneak preview, it becomes clear that someone else is donning the iconic mask and terrorising the campus. With Deputy Dewey (David Arquette) and Weathers herself now back in Prescott's location could the killer have ties to the original case or is notoriety prize enough.I was surprised as to how much the sequel holds up. Aside from the returning cast from the original, there are a host of young-looking talent in this one, Timothy Olyphant, Jada Pinkett Smith, Omar Epps, Sarah Michelle Gellar & Jerry O'Connell. Not to mention, Tori Spelling, Luke Wilson and Heather Graham who show up in the 'oh so meta' scenes from ""Stab"" that we see.They find a sensible way to draw the characters back into each other's circle and the plot makes sense. I think the reveal of who the killers are is better than the proposed one that was in the leaked script, personally, but to each their own. I think it's another witty script from Kevin Williamson, with oblique references to other horror films and even to this one itself as being a sequel.Admittedly, this one stretches some of the bound of credibility more than the previous one. The murderer is at times both hilariously clumsy and unrealistically lucky. The opening murder, for example, requires them to drive a knife through a thick wooden bathroom stall, and also hit the head of a victim that they can't see.It's not as iconic as it's predecessor, but still is a worthy follow up.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Looks like it mis... No no no a worthy sequel,"Scream 2 opens up pretty neat by mocking through american slasher celebration culture which is done beautifully. Parody scenes of part 1 was the best part of the movie. Although it is not as intense as scream 1, this one succeeds with its much violent gory second half and the plot twists which make it a worthy sequel. Neve Campell's acting performance is worth a watch, the way she nails the life of such a depressed women deserves applause. Courtney Cox too does her part of the media vixen yet again neat and clean. The out of the box style climax setting, video room scene extra add to the tension builder part of the movie and makes the second half more engaging than its first half.The only con of the movie is that, the first half could not impress as compared to its previous movie.

Ugggh,"I saw this movie the day it came out because a bunch of my friends asked me to go and I wasn't doing anything. I wish I had been. I wasn't a big fan of the original, and this one has made me lose almost all faith in horror/slasher movies altogether.I would probably blame it on realism. As with most horror movies, the killers don't follow any known psychcological profile of a serial killer. And something that bothers me moreso is the way that it is referred to as a copycat killer, when that is not what it actually is, although it appears that way at the beginning.It had some good puns in it, but those couldn't help fix the rest of it. I chose to not go to a party once because I found out that they were going to be watching this movie there. I can't stand it.

Well, maybe it was the killer's trick, though. But how do I know?The ending where Sidney and the killer were dueling was my favorite part. What Sidney did was so awesome. This girl really can act fast and unerring even when in a tough situation. Too bad, the scene where Gale rose up after being shot gave me a weird face. What made it worst is when the killer also did the same exact thing. Too cliché. Thank God he did nothing but made an odd movement.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Scream 2 (1997),"70/100. Apparently Scream didn't get the message from earlier slasher movies that the sequel is supposed to be bad to average. What I really like about Scream 2 is that it doesn't try and be all that different and they for all intensive purposes cop to that fact in the movie by referencing it consistently even playing reenacted scenes from the previous years film. As if that point wasn't already shoved down our throats we are constantly reminded by multiple characters that sequels always are inferior. Why such the high grade? Because not only is the story just as scary and funny, but its characterization may even be superior. By the end of the film Courtney Cox as Gale Weathers is not the same person she was at all in first Scream, and you really feel for Sidney understanding her inner demons and reluctance of trust toward her college boyfriend after her fling with her psychopathic high school sweetheart. It was fun to see more than one character from a previous slasher film especially since I enjoyed all of the characters previously. One of the few teen slice and dice movies where you actually really pull for your favorite characters to come out alive. Liev Screiber is fantastic in an expanded role as the hard luck former lover of Mrs. Prescott looking to cash in on his misfortune of being wrongly accused for her death as detailed in the first Scream. Kevin Williamson writes his crass dialogue beautifully which really made me wonder why more characters haven't been fleshed out similarly before. I was a big fan of the opening which I felt was even better than the slightly over-the-top intro with Drew Barrymore. Although the final showdown was somewhat of a let down, scenes such as having to crawl past the killer to escape the pinned police car and Sarah Michelle Gellar's frightening encounter with Ghost face certainly gave off enough thrills. Admittedly not as good as the first, Scream 2 in my mind very well might be the best slasher sequel made to date.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Make the stupidity stop.,"Okay I enjoyed Scream.  It kept me guessing and it wasn't as bad as I expected it to be.  Now from a long distance perspective Scream 2 wasn't too bad.  I mean her boyfriend in this one is hot and the scene with him on the cross and her going through some serious doubts was well done I thought.  A for effort. You knew the ""but"" part was coming.  Scream 2 was okay but...COME ON!!!  I give full pardons to those characters who have not been in Scream 1 and have not been...heretofore...chased by a raving psychopath with a knife.  Think about this seriously folks.  It's school time and you've just gotten rid of...barely... a murderous duo who slashed half of your friends and acquaintances.  What is you summer activity most likely going to be?  That's right boys and girls...martial arts training and marksmanship training.  You would also be carrying around...IF NOTHING ELSE FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.. a can of mace. Okay those thoughts aside.  Say maybe these characters are not going to let the violence of society turn them hard and coarse. Fair enough I can respect the pacifist's viewpoint.  But for god's sake it starts happening again and you just casually hang around.  A danger to you friends and significant others?  No my friends you would get a car...check all the trunks back seats etc.  Get in your car and drive.  Where?  Who cares somewhere else where your friends are not going to get hurt.  I mean she essentially was the cause of both her roommate's and her boyfriend's murder.  Sigh.  Just had to get that off my chest.  I'll probably watch Scream 3 if it comes out too. hoping against hope that one of the characters picks up a gun before the end when it's basically pointless.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Scream 2,"At the premiere of the film 'Stab' which recreates what happened in 'Scream' every other person in the audience is dressed as 'Ghost Face' giving the real killer an opportunity to strike. What follows is the coming together of most of the characters from the 1st film to try an avoid being filleted by the new killer and subject to horror sequel rules.It was never going to be as good as the original, which was liked so much because if it's originality.

A competent sequel,"As a sequel, Scream 2 feels a little rushed, or maybe like the filmmakers weren't quite as passionate this time around. I imagine you'd feel the burnout, having to make another movie in a series just one year after the first, so I think it's a good sign that Scream 3 was a 2001 release (though based on my limited knowledge of the series, that one's apparently not as good as the first two).The meta-commentary continues, and I feel like it would've been decent for its time... though today, it's nothing amazing. Plenty of talk about sequels, movie violence relating to real-world violence, and events repeating. It gets the job done, and it's kind of fun, though not amazing. At least it's a mostly entertaining watch, albeit slightly overlong at two hours.And at the end of the day, Scream 2 is still better than 90% of slasher movies out there. Any slasher movie that's at least decent is arguably worth celebrating.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great sequel,"The returning cast members from Scream are as entertaining as they were in the first, whilst the new faces do a great job. The writing is still sharp (amazingly, considering the rewrites they had to do 'on the fly' after a script-leak), and the film-within-a-film is a great idea. Plus, there are more kills - with even more blood - than in the original. I gave the first one 8/10 - this gets 8.5.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
a bit overrated,"It's just not as strong as the first film. Whether it's the characters or the overly long runtime that dilutes things, it's become a bit overrated and time has not been kind to it. It also feels disjointed at times, with some plots going absolutely nowhere.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
It all but admits that it's terrible,"This is emblematic of why I don't really like what the whole ""guess who's the killer"" genre has become. It's become purely about misleading the audience and making them unable to see what's coming. That's a plus for many people, obviously, but it actively prevents the film from being about anything, from the narrative actively pursuing any ideas. It also separates the final act from the rest of the film since none of what comes before the it informs the actions of the finale. It ends up being a frustrating viewing experience at best, helped none at all by some very, very questionable narrative choices that ends in simple ridiculousness.Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) has made it to college two years after the events of the first film. She gets prank calls from people imitating the voice of Ghostface, all of which she takes in stride by using caller ID. The calls are increasing recently because the film, Stab, based on the book written by Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) about the events in Woodsboro, California, has come out. The film actually starts with a preview screening of Stab where two college students are murdered by a new Ghostface where the film introduces its meta elements much earlier than in the previous film. The reason for this is that the movie needs time between the introduction of the idea and the actual fulfillment of the idea in the finale for us to completely forget about it, not that the introduction has any real establishing effect on the film's antagonist.Because of the deaths of the two students and the release of the movie, a media circus has descended on the university, led by Gale Weathers with Dewey (David Arquette), Gale's former and embittered lover as well as former deputy of Woodsboro, in order to provide support to Sidney in this potential time of need.The first major sign that something was wrong with this film, though, comes with the death of Cici (Sarah Michelle Gellar), a sorority sister in the house that Sidney is potentially rushing (absolutely nothing comes of the idea of Sidney joining a group of vapid young women other than providing the film cannon fodder). The thing is that the deaths at the beginning of the film act as that sort of Drew Barrymore opening by using two movie stars (Omar Epps and Jada Pinkett) who get killed off early (complete with dialogue from Pinkett about the unfair ""rules"" around black characters in slasher films that the movie then proceeds to...completely fulfill), and then we get Sarah Michelle Gellar going through pretty much the same scene as Barrymore had gone through, only ending with a stunt rather than a dummy hanging from a tree. It feeds into the simplistic idea about sequels spoken about in a film class between Randy (Jamie Kennedy) and Mickey (Timothy Olyphant) about how sequels are always bigger and never as good.The killings continue in expected fashion, and that's another frustrating thing about the film. For a franchise that started with this concept of being rule-breaking, it settled into its own convention very quickly. The film was put into production a mere six months after the release of the first one and released almost exactly a year after that first release. It was rushed to take advantage of the sudden popularity of the potential franchise, and that didn't allow for Kevin Williamson or Wes Craven to take any time to find anything interesting to do. The dictates were, apparently, from the studio to simply make it again. Instead of, perhaps, taking the franchise into a new sub-genre of horror (imagine Randy's part if his experience in a slasher movie prevented him from recognizing that they're now in a cosmic horror film) or even going so far into subverting the rules of the genre that absolutely everyone dies and we never even figure out the identity of the killer. Instead, it's just the same thing again.Attacks escalate to the point where the police put Sidney under constant watch and suspicion gets pointed at Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber), the man Sidney had helped put in jail for a year under the suspicion of the rape and murder of her mother. As things get heated at the school, Sidney and her roommate Hallie (Elise Neal) get taken in a police car, but then Ghostface shows up at a red light, instantly kills the policeman driving. The following sequence is supposed to be tense, but it's so ridiculous that it was the point where I went from wary about the film to outright hostile to it. The policeman, instead of just shooting, gives a verbal warning even after Ghostface has killed his partner, which gives Ghostface enough time to run him down and crash the car. Ghostface gets knocked out, the policeman killed, and Sidney and Hallie remain alive in the backseat but unable to get out from their own doors, necessitating them peel back the black mesh that separates the front from the back and then climbing over the unconscious Ghostface to get out of the car. They do this twice. There's supposed tension around them trying to pull Ghostface's mask off, but they never even do it, and once out they instantly start to run away, giving him time to wake up and get away. No, just no. This was beyond stupid and designed to simply extend the film. It was a situation that Williamson had written the characters into and had no idea how to believably get them out of it without ""ruining"" the villain's reveal later. It fails miserably, and I ended up against the movie from that point on.The final reveal is the kind of ridiculous extended dialogue scene with people screaming, explaining, and threatening, all while, because the film had made every effort to make it impossible to guess the killer, the audience is supposed to be going, ""I did not see that coming."" After it was done, I went back to the one moment in the movie where there might have been information given on the real killer's identity early, and it's so short with no information actually given that the only way to use it in support of any theory before the reveal is the idea that we don't actually know what was said, so in terms of red herrings, it was the least obvious red herring in the film, so it must be the right one. There's no character support, just a quarter of a line of dialogue that gets cut off.I really disliked this film. The meta stuff does worse than nothing, it actually points out the failings of the film. The emotional center of the first film, Sidney, has been watered down to nothing because the film isn't about her but about tricking the audience. There was always a somewhat uncomfortable balance between the meta elements in the first film and its emotional core, but it made it work in the end there. Here, the meta elements don't work, there is no emotional core, and the whole thing is simply an unconvincing magic trick. In other words, it's kind of exactly what one should expect from the sequel to an unexpected surprise hit rushed to production to hit a release date.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good Suspense Trilogy II,"A continuation of the first movie, you do not need to have seen the original but it would help to setup the finer points of the relationships of the characters.Things start when a movie about the happenings of the first film is released in the theaters.

Durring a party scene at a ""martini mixer"", Mathew Lillard is in the background. Blonde hair, glasses. Apparently he and Neve were dating. Some guys get all the luck.)

The law of diminishing returns,"The original Scream had an immeasurable impact on the future of cinema. It spearheaded the concept of the meta horror film while still managing to be effectively scary in it's own right. It launched the teen horror boom of the early aughts while simultaneously making the paint-by-numbers slasher feel passé. For all it's accolades, it also painted itself into a corner in terms of where it could go with it's sequels.The story was simplistic by design, leaving room for the characters to critique the tropes of the genre as they were playing out. Once the novelty of this wears off though, what you're left with is a pretty predictable murder tale, with probably the least intimidating monster in the history of cinema. It goes through the motions of picking off co-eds in the exact style it once satirized, and once you've seen one, you've seen them all. Even though it was built to critique the slasher films of the 80s/90s, Scream is more of a Giallo in nature, as the plot mostly concerns itself with finding the identity of a masked killer, without any supernatural implications. As such, it also falls for the traps of that genre, and who-dun-it stories in general, with obvious red herrings and a totally random final reveal.One new element that Scream 2 brings to the table is the existence of the Stab movies within it's universe. Having a Scream-like movie exist within Scream is exactly the meta hall of mirrors the franchise was built for and nearly gives this film a reason for existing.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

You don't put people in danger by handing out killer's masks, making it way too easy for actual murders and/or dangerous activity to take place. Don't get me wrong, I love Wes Craven and re-watching 90s flicks, but the only thing making this film tolerable is Gale's character and Deputy Dewy.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"'Scream 2' ends up a fun, bloody and silly slasher...","Scream 2 It has been two years since the tragic events at Woodsboro. Sidney Prescott and Randy Meeks are trying to get on with their lives, and are currently both students at Windsor College. Cotton Weary is out of prison, and is trying to cash in on his unfortunate incarceration. Gale Weathers has written a bestseller, ""The Woodsboro Murders,"" which has been turned into the film, ""Stab,"" starring Tori Spelling as Sidney. As the film's play date approaches, the cycle of death begins anew. Dewey Riley immediately flies out of Woodsboro to try to protect Sidney, his ""surrogate sister.""

Nowhere near as clever as it thinks it is,"I think the notion that anything of any real interest is going to happen in this film can be set aside right during the opening sequence. The film is entirely focused on setting up a clever gag where Jada Pinkett is killed during a screening of ""Stab"" ... but the idea that anyone would adapt Courteney Cox's bit of true crime journalism as a cheap slasher film is just absurd, as is the idea that the audience would be hooting and hollering for this movie that nobody has ever seen before.My issue with the film is that it reproduces discreet things that the original film had ... phone calls, dudes with knives running around in costume, horror movie cliché jokes ... but doesn't really work them into a meaningful or plausible plot. It gestures at doing this. At one point we discover that the murders are following the same pattern as the original film, suggesting that the characters could do actual detective work and save the next victim and/or catch the killer. But the movie immediately discards this idea, and no future murders follow any pattern at all.I don't think it's anything like an awful film, but it's a film deeply in love with a perceived cleverness that isn't really there.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Stab 2,Scream 2 is a solid sequel to the original. It's the movie that really embraces the Scream brand and creates the fan base for the entire franchise to come.

Even louder than the first,"I know the rule of movies; sequels can NEVER be better than the originals. But in Scream's case this rule is broken. Scream 2 is not only better than the original film but it's also got a better group to back the original leads Sidney, Dewey, and Gale up. Jerry O'Connell, Jamie Kennedy, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Timothy Olyphant, and Marisol Nichols all take part in this great sequel and whether their roles are short or long, they are appreciated.Scream did however mess with one thing in it's years; the self aware aspect. It works in this film, and it's good because the film, like I said, knows when to be scary and knows when to be witty. The sad thing is Scream did so well that now it makes other horror films like newer installments of Friday the 13th and I Know What You Did Last Summer feel like they need to be self aware to be good. Not the case.Scream has the right writing and direction to accomplish such a goal. The characters know they are in a real life sequel. Wes Craven knew what he wanted to do and screenwriter Kevin Williamson knew how to be good with references without going too overboard. Nowadays this concept is beyond overused and is now becoming a tiresome and dreary old form of comedy/horror. Only Scream could accomplish it correctly.Scream 2 is relatively the same thing as it's predecessor. Only now the lead characters have all seen a film called Stab which is the movie version of the murders they were involved with. Sort of like Scream is a movie about itself. Following? Well, same formula here. The characters know every horror movie cliché and instead of making the usual mistakes, they come up with ways to do their own mistakes.I like the cast a lot more in the sequel. We get Jerry O'Connell, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Rebecca Gayheart, Timothy Olyphant, Omar, Epps, and even Marisol Nichols has a brief cameo. The cast is perfect. A great addition to a worthy sequel. Normally I don't like sequels more than the originals. But Scream 2 manages to accomplish a bit more than the first.The question at this point is how much more steam does the Scream series have? We have a third film that came out in 2000, and a fourth film in the series, released in 2011. Is Scream going to run itself down? Or will prove worthy of so many sequels and show that you can't ever scream too much?

Huge dissapointment.,"56/100Scream 2 had a ton to prove. Firstly, knowing that both the director and writer of the first Scream were coming back, I was expecting that parody-esque sense the franchise is known for but, at the same time, the willingness to risk a potential storyline or narrative to give the whodunnit aspect of it more protagonism. That's what I admired from Scream. This time around, what I feared at some bits of this movie's predecessor are more evident than ever here. The fun of it went a bit too far.It might not be bad enough to give it a 56/100 but, once I knew the charm of the first Scream was long gone, I couldn't look at it differently.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not bad for a sequel,"Yes, the first 'Scream' movie basically reinvented the tired 'slasher' genre and it's still being imitated to this day. I dare say that not even the producers dreamed it would be as popular as it was. Yet it was. Therefore a sequel was almost guaranteed.The greatest thing about 'Scream' was how 'self aware' it was, constantly parodying its own genre. Therefore, the imaginatively-titled 'Scream 2' had a lot to live up to. Did it? The film itself answers the question. Knowing it's a sequel, one of the characters states that by definition a 'sequel is an inferior product.' I guess he has a case (although the other characters disagree with him!). 'Scream 2' may not be as original as the original (surprise, eh?), but it carries on nicely in the same vain.Neve Campbell (and the remaining survivors of the first encounter) all return (which is nice and not always common in horror sequels) for this outing where, once again, they're mercilessly stalked by a masked killer. Yes, the plot is pretty simple – as was the original and so many slasher flicks before it – but it works, again. The fact is that there's so many awful slasher/horror films infesting the bargain DVD buckets that this sequel almost seems like a masterpiece in its own right.Once again there are plenty of 'red herrings' in terms of characters who may or may not be the killer and I doubt anyone will really guess who's behind the mask until it's too late. Neve Campbell is great to root for as the heroine, but David Arquette does tend to steal the show in terms of sheer lovability! It's witty, it's gory and it's fun. If you liked the first, you should enjoy the second and if you like slasher/horror films in general, you should also get something out of this. Yes, like the character 'Randy' says, it may be an inferior product, but don't let that put you off. And don't think too deeply about plot points – but then if you're a fan of the genre you probably do that anyway when it comes to slasher flicks.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Wes and Williamson do it again.,"Wrongly imprisoned and almost executed for the murder of town bike Maureen Prescott, Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) could be forgiven for being a little bitter towards young Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), whose false testimony resulted in his incarceration. But is the recently released Weary responsible for the spate of copycat killings taking place at Sidney's college? With so many candidates for campus maniac to choose from, it's anyone's guess...Scream 2 is definitely a case of 'more of the same', but when 'the same' is of such a high calibre, this really isn't much of an an issue: the film is still an absolute blast and a worthy successor to the brilliant original.This time around, writer Kevin Williamson abides by most of the rules of the horror sequel, as defined by the film's very own movie nerd Randy: the body count is bigger and the death scenes are more elaborate, and definitely messier. Fortunately, Williamson doesn't stick to the notion that sequels have to be inferior: the superbly constructed script, masterful direction from Wes Craven and great performances from an excellent cast (several of whom reprise their roles from the first film) ensure that Scream 2 works like a charm, providing fans with another satisfying dose of fear laced with laughter.In addition to the expected scenes of stalk and slash, the well executed jump scares, and the usual quota of red herrings, there are in-jokes aplenty for film buffs to spot, and umpteen 'guest' stars who pop up in blink-and-you'll-miss-'em bit parts (familiar faces include Heather Graham, Tori Spelling, Luke Wilson, Portia de Rossi, and Jada Pinkett, plus Sarah Michelle Gellar, Rebecca Gayheart and Joshua Jackson, who would subsequently appear in Scream-alike slashers I Know What You Did Last Summer and Urban Legend).If you loved the first Scream, then the chances are you'll have loads of fun with this one too.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

The only things about it that made me uneasy, like the first one, were some of the blood and gore. Other than that, I enjoyed it very much. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone involved in this film did an outstanding job. In conclusion, to all you horror film lovers that have not seen this very clever and hip horror sequel you'll love which will leave you feeling good, I highly recommend it!

A sequel thats as good as the 1st!!!! a thrill ride,"Brilliant, twisted, gory, fun, crazy,terrifying, clever, and nonstop thrills!!

"Fun, but the craft isn't there compared to the first","Everything interesting about this, such as the meta component people seeing a movie about the first movie and violence in cinema-something incredibly prevalent when it came out, you couldn't throw a rock at a PTA meeting and not hit a crusader worried about video games and movies corrupting children-ends up completely undermined and unexplored.It devolves too far into campiness and ends up being fun, but ironically unimaginative, considering the characters themselves bloviate about the unoriginality of sequels many times. I guess it's a self fulfilling prophecy. But when it isn't digressing there are some undeniably fun moments.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Lacks the screams but still a highly enjoyable thriller,"Sidney Prescott (Campbell) is traumatized when a film of her deadly experiences is released, and soon a killer replicating the movie starts killing her friends.In the sequel to the hugely popular Scream comes an equally enjoyable horror flick that presents mystery and intrigue right up until the well choreographed if slightly exaggerated climax.The characters who were not assassinated in the first film return with a bang in this picture, most notably Neve Campbell's Sidney who is trying to move on after her gruesome showdown with her boyfriend and psycho partner 2 years previously. But a gruesome murder spree at a local cinema at a screening of 'Stab' soon has suspicions raised as once more the Ghost mask is present.This now infamous murderer starts handpicking victims one by one and the way this story is told, there is no apparent reason and pattern to these killings, which generates a wonderful sense of mystery. In a sense this sequel is like a good crime novel. An obvious target, a couple of red herrings, gruesome murders and a gasping realization come the final part. In a way it's a shame to find out the identity of said killer as the mystery and unfathomable story is so well told you almost don't want to know. Sadly however every film has an end and with this comes a shocking realization and exciting final battle.Neve Campbell once more excels as the lead, being quietly aggressive and opinionated without being too squeamish in her paranoia. David Arquette receives a more inquisitive role in this sequel which takes into account his more vulnerable personality as Dewy with Courtney Cox as great and present as the annoying reporter.Wes Craven's approach to this sequel is, as Randy so eloquently puts it, have more deaths which are more elaborate and gory as the film's predecessor. Initially this statement seems to be tried and tested trivia but when the film gets into the latter stages we see the point as the deaths get hotter and heavier as the pace rounds to tension.With Scream the surprise and shock of the murderer kept the tempo at razor edge as clues and hints mislead us right until the jaw dropping finale, not to forget that there were a few jumpy moments in and amongst the gripping chases. With this sequel there are very few jump scenes and the conceptual genre of horror is left purely down to the gruesome killings. In a sense this is a more adept movie concentrating on the story rather than going for full out jumps. Whether you like jumping behind the sofa or be engaged physiologically remains irrelevant once the pace starts. There are nervous scenes but this doesn't generate the fear factor you may want from a horror film.Is this better than the original? No, purely because the first hit was so surprising and had the jumps and the tension, it made a complete horror. Do not be discouraged as where this may lack the freak-out factor; it is fast and highly enjoyable.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

It appears there's another masked serial murderer on the lose. Characters come and go, and get knifed up. Etc. etc.I thought it was okay. Nothing really new.

Probably the Best in the Series,"Scream was a phenomenon and a sequel seemed inevitable. Unlike most slashers franchises, however, it seems that the Scream franchise has something new to say. While the first film was a commentary on horror fandom, Scream 2 mostly ditches that in favor of the celebrity of murderers, copycats, revenge, and the expectations of a Hollywood sequel.Never does Scream 2 feel cloying and cutesy and, in fact, I'd say it has more guts than its predecessor. The film loves subverting expectations at every turn, kills off beloved characters with malicious glee, keeps our leads in constant danger, and actually manages to continue developing the survivors from the first film. In most sequels, if a surviving character returns, they're rendered more or less catatonic (Halloween II) or they're killed off in the opening minutes of the film.Wes Craven proves once again that he's a master of suspense with a few genuinely nail biting sequences that might just be the best of his career.Don't be fooled - Scream 2 is way better than you'd ever imagine it would be and well worthy of your time.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

"...2, the ""Back For More"" movie.","...And the audience was desperate for a sequel! Yep, the inevitable was near, so near it was a only a single year after the original ""Scream"" that we saw a continuation of the Wes Craven movie that spawned a huge following. This film did nothing more than take the first film to a new and alleged stereotypical setting that would be ground zero for another slasher story. I can say, however, that this film was, in event, actually better than its procedure. I guess most sequels sometimes feel more intriguing than the originals, but only to an extent. The feeling is usually only a left-over sentiment from the original winning a fans heart. In ""Scream 2"", there is both, a sentiment, and excitement that runs along the entire film. Better yet, the first film may as well not even exist, seeing as Kevin Williamson made quite sure that any pre-requisite films need not apply this time around. You hear so much about the first one, why even bother watching? All you get is twice the gore, twice the cheese, and all that goofy Williamson dialog, fit with cheap so-called innovation.This time, we have a new movie opening up appropriately titled 'Stab'. A hot'n'happening college couple are out on a date to inspect it, or rather, he is, she should be back in the dorm studying. At any rate, trouble ensues when the culture-oriented colleagues become the hot topic of the following morning news.Yes, a second killer is here, and Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) cannot help but feel that somehow, it is all her fault. If this is incorrect, than Campbell gives off the wrong signals all throughout the film. Anyway, the public media creates a frenzy at a nice little college where Campbell and Kennedy from the first, now reside. Guess who else in back...Gale Weathers! Yes, the convenient 'Stab' franchise is based on none other, than the ""Scream"" original caper itself! How Very! (or not!). David Arguette also comes back as the laid-back, humble cop Dewey. We get to see more of Kennedys' rambling about supposed pop- culture sequels such as ""Aliens"" . We also receive information about slasher movies located at a college campus. We learn of ""House On Sorority Row"", ""The Dorm that Dripped Blood"", even a little bit about ""Showgirls"". How fun! In any case, blood baths return, as well as more predictability and that 'lingo' issue Williamson had with the first one.Arquette, Campbell, and Cox are well on target, keeping their characters up to par with the original formality they began with. Kennedys ""Randy"" is more intellectual, and given the treatment of a saint...and for what? All he does is sit side and give his own commentary about sequels and trilogies. How original...right! Perhaps if he was not such a film geek before... Other cast members are fun to watch. Jerry O'Connel, Timothy Olephant, and Rebecca Gayheart are nice and steady. A real joker about this, is the disgustingly goofy way that Sarah Michelle Gellar has a bit part as a typical sorority girl on campus. Please...it was enough in ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" also written by Williamson, but I remember finding out she was in this after ""Summer"" and thinking it was pretty ridiculous. There is, however, a performance that stands out major from the rest of the cast, and the award for best actor/actress in this installment goes to Laurie Metcalf, for a great comeback into film, as well as all the little manifestations she creates.The writing is slightly better than the original, and obviously so, as the first one was the starting point for all this madness and violence. The issue of extreme language and convenient movie knowledge still present, only this time, we have a full classroom of film studies, where everyone is just like Kennedys' ""Randy"". Williamson is too enthralled to slow the pace, and thusly the story is quick and sharp, if sometimes repetitive and lacking. I suppose it is likely that Williamson reached a certain status of narcissism with the success of the first film. It is all too fake by the end. Some of the dialog is just as hammy as Thanksgiving dinner. Albeit entertaining.Wes Craven gives his usual storytelling in genius fashion, but the impact on pop-culture is still all to shocking to believe. We still have the same direction as the first, with no real end of the tunnel. New back stories and twists may come off as new direction for the story,but for the most part, it just says the same old thing over and over again. Maybe by ""Scream 3""...",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very good horror sequel,"While its not as good as the original, ""Scream 2"" is for the most part a very entertaining horror-comedy. Director Wes Craven, writer Kevin Williamson, and stars Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, and David Arquette came back for this sequel. This time Campbell's character Sidney Prescott is away at college when murders start happening again. Cox (as Gale Weathers) and Arquette (as Dewey) arrive at the campus to find out what's going on and to try to find the killer (since the cops are no good in these movies). ""Scream 2"" isn't as good as the original because it's a little slow-moving at times which wasn't the case with the first film. Still, I was entertained for the most part, and the supporting cast of new actors do a good job. The only other actors to return from the original are Jamie Kennedy as nerdy Randy (the horror movie expert) and Liev Schreiber as Cotton Weary, the man Campbell had put in jail for the murder of her mother but found out at the end of the first movie that he was innocent (Schreiber's part in the first movie was very brief; here he has a major supporting role). New cast members include Sarah Michelle Gellar (TV's ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer""), Jerry O'Connell (TV's ""Sliders""), Jada Pinkett (Mrs. Will Smith), and Laurie Metcalf (TV's ""Roseanne""). ""Scream 2"" is violent like the original and also like the first film has a sharp sense of humor. Worth a look.*** (out of four)",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Almost as great as the first,"Like Aliens and T2, Scream 2 is one of the only sequels as great as the original. Picking up after the events of the original Sidney is off at college with Randy and some new friends when the murders start up again. Like the original the film is a slasher whodunit as we along the characters try and figure out who it is as it marches towards its thrilling conclusion. Like any great sequel of which there is few it expands the universe and fleshes out the characters even more. There is one emotionally devastating scene concerning Dewey and Gale that may be the best of the series. Craven refreshingly adapts the material bringing new life to the genre. The movie is comedic but also suspenseful, scary and surprising. When the mystery finally unfolds it's not only shocking but so well constructed you can't help but be awed by the complex methodology that went it to it courtesy of its amazing creators master Wes Craven and my idol Kevin Williamson and the strong cast that pull it off. Speaking of performances everything is upped a notch. Neve Campbell is electrifying as Sidney giving her a u pique strength and relatable vulnerability. Courtney Cox really has a journey in this film as Gale and David Arquette is again wonderfully and layered as Dewey. As for the newbies Timothy Olyphant, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Laurie Metcalf and Liev Schreiber offer solid support. This entry has a bit more to say about the mechanics of the genre and is even a bit more involved than it's predecessor but the sheer magnetism of the first is never fully met. As it stands it's still one hell of an amazing movie.Budget: $24m

as history repeats itself...,"""Scream 2"" pulls off the seemingly impossible task of outdoing the original. With the murders in her hometown now behind her, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is now in college. Only the murders aren't over; someone is coming after her and in the process, pulling off murders as they appear in sequels. The rules are: the body count is always higher, and the death scenes are more elaborate. And I gotta say, I didn't see that ending coming.I should warn you that there is a scene in this movie that will probably make you jump. You'll know it when you see it (or more accurately, when you jump). Campbell does a great job, as do Courtney Cox, David Arquette, Jamie Kennedy, Liev Schreiber, and the rest of the cast. And of course, Wes Craven affirms his status as one of America's great directors.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
An Average Sequel,"After the success of the original Scream film, this sequel was greenlit very quickly and I have now watched Scream 2 and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees Sidney move to College in order to get away from the killings of the past, but she gets dragged back in when a copycat killer bursts onto the scene.Main Character
Neve Campbell reprises her role as Sidney and I think she does an okay job here. There is no denying she keeps the essence of the character from the first film alive and there isn't any doubt that she does enough to keep the character interesting. But I don't know, I didn't feel there was as much intensity here and that she kind of just went through the motions at times and I didn't care as much here as I did in the previous film.Supporting Characters
David Arquette and Courteney Cox are back in there roles as Dewey and Gale and they are once again fun to watch. There is an argument that the characters haven't developed that much since the original but I can't help but enjoy there chemistry together. Liev Schrieber plays a role here and it is funny seeing how young he is here but he does a decent job. His character is a bit all over the place and feels a bit disconnected but I think he was fine. I have some issues like the first film with some of the overacting, even by talented actors and it just takes me out of the film and shows its age.Story
The story has some merit, it is interesting seeing a copycat killer and I couldn't work out who the killer was for quite a while which surprised me. But the film overreaches for me and I found the final reveal itself to be a bit lacking. I also don't think the characters felt the drastic repercussions from the original film as much as they should have done.Script
The script is okay and once again I like how this film attempts to deconstruct horror films and sequels in general. But there just isn't as much to this script as there was in the previous film and it mostly feels like a bunch of rehashed moments.Style
The film has some fun action and horror scenes. Credit has to go to the stunt people who are in the ghostface costume as they throw themselves around to make the action and horror seem even more intense. But the film doesn't hit the heights of its previous film and the film is a bit longer then it really needs to be.Overall
Overall, Scream 2 is an average sequel that rehashes most of the plot points from the original film but slightly worse. Unless you are a big horror fan then you can give this one a miss.Rating - 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Whats your favorite scary movie? Again,"It still brings out the generic slasher flick elements in a taunting manner and sort of makes a joke out of them. Or at least makes references to those horror movies. Which I found to be one of the key factors of why the ""Scream"" franchise to be popular. At least it was the factor that I enjoyed in the first ""Scream"" movie with it's horror movie rules and such. And was one of the reason why it stood out from being just another generic slasher flick. However this time it's less clever from the previous movie, not that the previous ""Scream"" was all that clever and this time it's way more silly. Like one of the quote from this movie ""sequels suck"" ""they are inferior films"" I wouldn't say this movie sucked, but it's inferior to the first ""Scream"". But I really liked how this makes references to the first ""Scream"" movie, it's the most intriguing part of this movie. And although it's inferior, it's still a satisfying sequel. There is more body counts this time around, but that doesn't necessarily a good thing for slasher flicks all the time. This film although puts more emphasis on who's the killer aspect, but it just isn't that engaging for the audience. What I found really absurd about this movie is how, although the scenarios for the killer is coincidental it always goes according to the way the killer wants it to. Decent sequel but just wasn't as sharp as the first ""Scream"".

Better than the first part!,"Well, ""Scream 2"" is much better than the first part.

"As good, if not better than the first.","'Scream 2' is as good if not better than the original. Some won't agree but it is bursting with originality, suspense and shocks.It is far more self referential and extremely clever - looking at if violent films can influence viewers to commit violent crimes, analysis of the media, the effects of the first on the surviving characters.Okay, I'll admit the opening scene and the killer revelations don't match up to the first 'Scream' but could they ever? The film is still packed with tense scenes. The scenes of Gale in the sound recording studio and Sidney and Hallie trapped in the car are pure tension.The film manages to stay fresh despite this being Ghostface's second outing and I hope it stays this way for the third and final installment.The film is totally enjoyable. It is one of my favourite ever films and definitely my favourite ever sequel. Kevin Williamson is a modern day writing genius and Wes Craven gives the film a good pace and times the shocks just right.In closing,the film is witty, clever, scary, jumpy, gory and the characters are likeable.

And why should this scare me?,"Granted, when I rented the film I had very low expectations. I found out that I didn't think the film sucked, but I had many problems with it. First of all, the killer/killers is/are so easy to spot that it's almost embarrassing. Again, the musical score is utter and total crap. And also it's not nearly as funny as the original. I thought the funniest scene was in the ""movie in the movie"" when Tori Spelling is going to take a shower and we get a shot of the shower knob with water streaming down EXACTLY like the one in ""Psycho""! That, and that they for some reason play the theme from John Woo's ""Broken Arrow"" every time David Arquette enters. Other than that, it relies on stringers instead of atmosphere and suspense, which is truly despicable. It's well shot and edited, and pretty well acted, but that's about it. Above all, the film is too predictable and too stupid to be scary, and that's not a good thing for a horror film. It's not bad, it's and allright film, just not something particularly memorable.

Scream 2,"So, moving along two years from the first carnage, ""Sidney"" (Neve Campbell) has moved into the Omega Beta Zeta frat house and is getting on with the her life. Well, that is what she hopes anyway but after a few minutes of this derivative and unimaginative sequel, we are back to square one when she learns on television that the grim reaper is back taking out fans at a sneak preview of ""Stab!"" - a film based on her first terrifying experiences. Then her friends start to drop, one by one - slasher style. Can she and reporter ""Gale Wethers"" (Courteney Cox) stay alive long enough to find out just who - or whom - is behind these ghastly crimes? I'm sorry, but this is just a straight and pretty shameless rip off of the first film. It's entirely devoid of menace or originality and the concluding twenty minutes are borderline farce. Wes Craven has a magic touch when it comes to gory action-horror films, but here he left it on the bathroom floor. This is just poor and repetitive and despite a competent cast just left me yawning after twenty minutes. Two hours is simply ninety minutes too long.

A solid sequel...,"I really enjoyed the first Scream film, in fact I'd go so far as to rate it as a modern horror classic, so I was hoping that this film would be all that it's forerunner was, and would be another thrilling, knowing, well structured horror chiller...and for the most part it achieves this, although that said it definitely lacks some of the originality and class of the original.Scream 2 has it's share of tense scenes and well paced scares, and is again helmed with edgy style by Wes Craven, but similar to a discussion by actors David Arquette and Jamie Kennedy in the film, it fails to be bigger, badder and scarier than the first film, despite it's best efforts to deliver to the contrary.Perhaps it's just a case of the original working so well that this fails to match up in comparison, as it's still definitely one of the best chillers to come out in quite some time, (and far superior to most modern efforts) and it does have a good twist ending that works well...although it must be said it isn't as convincing as the original films twist was, but there's just something about Scream 2 that feels slightly by the numbers.Then again maybe it's down to the fact that this film was made so soon after the original, or that almost no matter what this film tries it can't match the freshness and originality that the first one had going for it. Or maybe it's the fact that the first film basically came out of nowhere to impress while this one has a stylish parentage to live up to that brings about the feeling that it isn't as satisfying as it should be, but whatever it is that feeling of ""almost, but not quite"" definitely comes into play.The acting for the most part is well done, with Neve Campbell once again providing a very solid lead, ably supported by the likes of returning players Courteney Cox, Jamie Kennedy, Liev Schreiber and new faces Sarah Michelle Gellar, Timothy Olyphant, Jada Pinkett, Omar Epps, Elise Neal and Heather Graham all fun in their various roles. However it's not all acting joy as Jerry O'Connell and David Arquette both seem to sleep through their roles, while Laurie Metcalf goes a little too far over the top in her role to be totally convincing. But even so there aren't any real embarrassments performance wise here to speak of, and for the most part everyone works quite well in their respective roles.As mentioned above Wes Craven does another very classy job of directing here, and while at times Kevin Williamson's script seems to be trying a little too hard, for the most part it's well written and paced, as is the film that it's based on.Maybe I'm being too critical, as the film based on it's own merits is still a darn good watch, but I just couldn't shake that ever so slight feeling of disappointment. Still that said Scream 2 is a very enjoyable horror film, and just so long as you don't go in expecting it to be all the original was you should have a pretty good time here.One man's opinion. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"A good sequel, but not to outshine the original (what sequel does?)","""Scream 2"" is pretty good when compared to the original, which many sequels aren't, but like the man says, sequels are by definition inferior films, so at least this one wasn't THAT inferior. In this film, a series of copycat murders are happening around Sydney Prescott (Neve Campbell) and the new killer starts coming after her and the other Woodsboro survivors. One thing I missed while watching this was the occasional laugh from the first one. This one had a couple of good lines, but ""Scream"" was definitely funnier, making fun of its own kind of movie. The funniest part in either film still remains as the moment in ""Scream"" when the killer is coming up behind Randy (JAMIE Kennedy) as he watches ""Halloween"" and says ""Jamie, look behind you!"" (referring to Jamie Lee Curtis). The acting in this film is not quite as good as it was in the original, but wasn't bad. Dewey (David Arquette) had a couple of moments of overdoing it, but not too many. The main problem with the film was the 'who's the killer' mystery.  There are more suspects to deal with, and the filmmakers seemed worried that if the killer's character is developed too much before revealing that they are the killer, then people will figure it out prematurely. As a result, when the killer is revealed, perhaps you didn't see it coming, but you aren't really shocked that this person could be a killer because you don't really know much of anything about them. One thing you start to learn during the movie is that just because someone was involved in the first ordeal, it doesn't mean that they aren't a possible suspect now, nor does it necessarily mean they aren't a potential victim.  Depending on how suspicious you are of people, there are countless numbers of suspects in the film, and to a really on-guard person, just about anyone in the movie is a suspect, which makes it really hard to identify the killer.  There was one thing I didn't like about the movie, and one character was murdered who I still think should have survived. I really can't see from here how they are planning to make ""Scream 3"" after this film seemed to burn the bridge to another sequel. It isn't necessary, seeing as how the same characters (mainly Sidney) have gone through the same type of ordeal twice, which is just on the edge of plausibility.  Maybe it's just so they can call it a ""trilogy"", but it really wouldn't be, because there really is a difference between a trilogy and a film with two sequels. In general, one sequel is enough and maybe pushing it, and a second sequel is almost always too far.  ""Scream 2"" is still scary, and may even be as scary as the first, although the opening scene of ""Scream"" is still the scariest of it all. This sequel doesn't make the same mistake many sequels to good films make, which is abandoning suspense altogether when it is too busy going all out with what it may have held back on in the first film, which in this case would have been as much gruesome death as possible. While it does have this extra gore (obviously it's going to -- this is a horror movie, after all) it still manages to have the same suspense that made the first one terrifying. If you loved the first film, you'll probably like this one too. This is still a good movie, but the first one, as always, was the best.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not as scary but twice as funny,"Scream 2 was flawed from the beginning. The release of this film so close to it's original was warning enough that this film would not be as good. The movie process can be a quick one but the process of making a GOOD movie is a little longer. With that said though Scream 2 is still pretty darn good.With the release of Stab, a film depicting the events of Woodsboro, copycat murders soon begin and so does a media invasion on the university that valiant Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is attending. The usual run from the killer scenes are there as is the who dunnit mystery of the original but has varying degrees of success with both. Scream 2 isn't as scary as it's predecesor instead replacing the horror with bitchy banter between Sidney and Gale Weathers (Cox in her returning role) and never ending pop culture references which do get tiresome with no suspence until at least 3/4 of the way through the movie (besides the opening scene).The cast isn't up to the caliber of the original either with the returning characters simply going through the motions. Neve seems bored, Kennedy's oddly reserved as Randy and David Arquette is back sporting a limp which he concentrates on more than his acting. Cox on the other hand is sensational. She's twice as bitchy and even colder second time round. As for the new recruits. They are as bland as the returning ones with a few exceptions. Pinkett betters Drew Barrymore's infamous opening scene, with her pro black attitude at the premiere of the white dominated film, Stab. Olyphant is also good as the ""freaky Tarantino film student"" as is Laurie Metcalf as a rival reporter.This film has high expectations to live up to and while it's a great film in it's own right, as a Scream sequel, it doesn't even rank. Grade - B+",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Funfilled and clever, but a couple mistakes.","When I first saw Scream 2 I thought that it was way better than the first one. Then when I saw it a couple more times, I noticed the problems of the movie. Although the script is as fresh with its characters and dialogue, some scenes in the movie are very predictable. It wasn't scary at all. The main killer at the end was stupid, I admit that. I loved the first killer that you found out about, as well as his/her motive. But then the movie introduced the partner, who turned out to be the main killer. It was really stupid. They cast the wrong person for it, and it just didn't work in many respects.Now, with the problems out of the way, I can tell you about the good things about the movie. I absolutely loved the whole idea of Stab in this movie. It created something totally different in the new movie world. For those of you who have not seen the movie, Stab is a movie-within a-movie based on the events in the first Scream. Tori Spelling plays Sidney, David Schwimmer plays Dewey, etc... It was very clever. It was also just as funny as the first one, and I was roaring with laughter during the scene when Dewey sees Gale and has a little talk about her book. Jamie Kennedy was in the spotlight for most of the film, and he did just as good a performance as Randy as he did in the first one. The whole cast of new people fit the Scream team very well, especially Jerry O'Connell, Sid's new boyfriend away at college.So, all in all, the movie was very good despite its weak ending and its sometimes predictable storyline. I used to think it was the best Scream, but the more I think about it, the more it's the worst one. It still is very good, though, and is a worthwhile and worthy follow-up to the greatest horror movie of the 1990's.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Up to par with the original,"This is one of those sequels that is just as good as the first.  Nothing was lost in the transition.  Supposedly there was a different first draft of the script that had a different killer, but I don't see how it could've compared to this.  Don't get me wrong, the first one is by far better, but this one is also good.  The only problem I had with part 2 is the whole part about the copycat killer.  I would've made for a better plot if that angle were carried throughout the film.  And once again, the opening fifteen minutes are extremely gratifying.  Too bad Mr. Williamson didn't stay around for the third installment.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great Sequel To A Great Movie, But Not As Good","Scream 2, directed by horror-master Wes Craven, is purely taking a stab at sequels. Scream was aimed at horror in general. It would reference movies like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween, Prom Night and Friday the 13th. It also stated the famous lines AKA. the 'Three Rules' of a horror movie. Scream 2 as I said before, is aimed at horror sequels and yet again, it has it 'Rules To A Sequel.' The plot is almost identical to the first Scream. Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is a student at Windsor College. She has a new group of friends and is adjusting perfectly. That is until two college students are murdered at the opening night of 'Stab,' a movie based on the events at Woodsborro. Now the cast get killed in more bloody ways.David Arquette returns as ex-deputy Dewey, Courtney Cox returns as reporter Gail Weathers and Jamie Kennedy returns as Randy Meeks. The new cast consists of Sarah Michelle Gellar as Cici Cooper, Jerry O' Connell as Derek and Timothy Oliphant as Mickey.Scream 2 is a very good sequel, very rare these days, but isn't as good as the original.The acting is once again great. With outstanding performances by Arquette, Cox and Campbell. The script is once again great and the score still chilling. The film is bloodier than Scream with more deaths, as the rules have stated.

Im ready for 3,"Wes Craven's ""Scream"" (1996) was a revolutionary horror movie in which the characters had seen other horror movies, knew all the cliches, and tried not to make mistakes. In ""Scream 2,"" the characters have seen a movie based on the first killings and are trapped in a slasher nightmare. The movie ""Scream 2"" is an example of how violence is quickly translated into marketable form by the media. It is so articulate about what it is doing that it is difficult to criticize it on those grounds. Do movies cause people to act violently? ""Scream 2"" seems to think so--or is that an ironic stance, to make the movie scarier? Will a movie like this, by educating its audience to the conventions and silly cliches of horror films, defuse the violence and make them less likely to be influenced? Now there's an intriguing notion. The success of the original Scream took everyone by surprise, earning over $100 million during its six month release window. A sequel was inevitable, and nearly the entire creative team has returned for Scream 2, including director Wes Craven, screenwriter Kevin Williamson, and actors Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, David Arquette, Jamie Kennedy, and Liev Schreiber. The body count in Scream 2 is higher than the original, but there is less gore. Craven has remembered that scares are more important than graphic displays of human insides and bodily fluids. The film also features a gallery of legitimate characters rather than cardboard cut-out stereotypes, making it easier to care about them. Craven and Williamson are having a lot of fun with Scream 2, and the movie is enjoyable, if a little overlong. The resolution to the obligatory ""whodunit?"" is less of a letdown than it could be, and offers a wink and nod at past unmasking scenes. However, the overall concept of a hip, self-referential slasher film has been played out, and if the film makers don't come up with something radical, we could end up with a classic case of sequel overkill. The field of potential victims in Scream is well-populated, with Cece (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Derek (Jerry O'Connell), a local newswoman (Laurie Metcalf), Gale's new cameraman (Duane Martin), a British drama teacher (David Warner), and several sorority sisters and would-be sorority sisters (Portia De Rossi, Rebecca Gayheart, Elise Neal, Marisol Nichols). Ultimately, there are lots of attractive corpses. Arquette and Cox are allowed to develop their characters, and the warming romance doesn't undercut their geniality or careerism too much. However, the sequel is hamstrung by not giving you what you liked last time. The movie has a trainspottery charm, with a sinister guest appearance from David Warner, Sarah Michelle Gellar's perky showing as the smart-mouthed blonde who gets on the killer's list, characters who are worried because their equivalents in the first film were gutted, and the gathering of all the survivors on stage in the finale for a student drama bloodbath.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

A shocking surprise of a movie,"Now I absolutely loved the first Scream movie and I must admit I was dreading the thought of a sequel (and many more to come but that's for later), so I jumped into this movie with absolutely no hope. Boy was I wrong.The first parts of the movie seemed visibly worse and I already had my expectations lowered but as the movie progressed I slowly realized that... it's good?One thing that has definitely improved, and I mean really improved is the acting. I had some moments where I could really feel the emotions of the characters, something that only happened with one character in the original movie towards the end of the movie, but I have to say I almost shed tears at one point.Now the main antagonist I would say I've definitely enjoyed less in general than the one in the original Scream movie... However, this one felt more impactful, more desperate, more... insane.But the one thing that truly surprised me was the evolution of the protagonist. Feels like a completely different character, someone who ACTUALLY experienced multiple murders and someone determined to stop the killer.Overall, I don't know if it's just because my expectations were low, or because it's almost 2am, but I really enjoyed this movie, and now I will start dreading the 3rd one.Yours faithfully,

Even more twisted than the first one.,The story starts off with two people standing in line to see the movie which is basically the novelisation of the book that Gail Weathers wrote. The story moves on to Sidney Prescott (played by Neve Cambell) who gets a call identical to the one she gets in the first Scream.

"highly enjoyable, albeit flawed sequel; not as enjoyable characters but still a humorous, bloody slasher","A fun, violent sequel to its predecessor, this one levels up on the blood and gore seemingly at the expense of entertaining characters, realism, and the parodying of itself. That said, it still doesn't take things too-too seriously, with a self-aware discussion of sequel's early on, and Jamie Kennedy's funny dissection of what makes sequels, well, sequels. Core characters from the original are back at it and just as effectively, if not more so, particularly in Courteney Cox's case. Neve Campbell was also more emotive, and vicious, especially at the end. Timothy Olyphant was definitely a favorite, but sort of overshadowed the other side characters throughout. Lapses in reality such as moving great distances so quickly and quietly were laughable this time around, and the immortality of some people just has to be accepted at this point in the series.

One Sharp Spoof,"In order to fully understand/enjoy a movie like scream 2 you must understand its intentions.  Kevin Williamson was a truly avid fan of cheesy 80's horror, with its cliches and vague hints.  Williamson's intention with this movie was, like in Scream, a mix of these cliches and few but clever clues about who the real killer(s) is. For someone like myself who has, to some extent unfortunately, seen many of these films this film was a delight. I don't know a greater movie going experience than to sit with close,intelligent friends and try not only to guess the ending but things such as timing (which Wes Craven adds his talents) and to revel in joy when those around see your dorky 'skills'.

Deliciously Scary But Not As Tasteful As Scream 1,"Well, well, well, Poor Sidney, she has had a hard life. Almost Sending an innocent man to the chair, being Attacked more than once, her mother being murdered and here she is again, having another bad day. Scream 1 was amazing, everything was unexpected but this one (although I loved it), still lost the sharpness and quality of its predecessor. In Scream 2,there are many suspects and although i want to say the who the killer is, I think you should go out and find out (if you haven't seen it). I bought Scream 1 and I have many other horror films but Scream 1 is still my favourite, but I will still go out and buy this film as if you have No.1, you have to own them all.

The Definition Of A Sequel Done Completely Right,"Having seen neither the first or third Scream's in all 14 years of my life it seems weird to most folks that I've started from the middle of the series. However with a little back story help from my Mother I can honestly say that Scream 2 out-does the original in every aspect. It's scarier, bloodier and more tense and clever.As always the star-studded cast delivers a great performance and the final unmasking of the killer is done excellently.The characters are quite likable as well, with great script-work and interesting chemistry thrown in.All in all it's a great film and fans of the original certainly won't be disappointed. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
WOW,"What can I say - Scream 2 is probably the best film I've seen in my life.  I loved the original, but this is just magnificent.The Acting is outstanding, especially Courteney Cox and Sarah Michelle Gellar (even if it was only for two scenes).In this movie you really feel deeply about the returning characters because they lived through the first movie, but now someone wants to make a sequel.Scream 2 is way, way funnier, much, much gorier and very, very exciting. (especially : The cop car scene, CiCi's phone ordeal, Stab : The Movie (very original) and just about the whole film)But like all movies, it has to have a flaw (2 infact)1 : It could focus more on the smaller characters like Halli, CiCi, Mickie, Randy and Joel and 2 : The killers sucked !!! It was virtually impossible to figure out the surprise killer, as it is practically a brand new character.But don't get me wrong, Scream 2 is still my favourite film of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Best scary movie ever made!,"This is my absolute favourit scary movie! I love it! This on is the most intense one in the Scream series. It is really exciting and very scary from time to time.

Does anybody like sequels?,"OKay, I must admit i was quite reluctant to go and see Scream 2.I thought that it was going to be another sequel that ruined the first movie.But i found out that it was not one of those movies that used the success of the first movie to make a sequel.I found out that the writer, Kevin Williamson, had the story already in his head when he was writing the original.It makes me quite angry when people say that it ruined the first movie because it was really good.Same Characters; New exciting story (goes along with old story); New, Fun Characters; New, mysterious location.A must see movie for all of the horror lovers!!My rating is a definite 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Slightly better than the first,"Scream 2 is slightly better than the first scream, I did enjoy the first movie, but I enjoyed this one more. Neve Campbell and Courtney Cox are still just as good as they were in the first movie, their characters haven't changed all that much. You know they say that sequels to movies, especially to scary movies, are usually pretty horrible, but that's just not the case with this film, you get the feeling that they actually tried and put some effort into this one and didn't just phone in another cheesy slasher romp. Some of the scares are the traditional jump scares and usuals that everyone is used to, but they are still pretty fresh and they work. The acting is good and I enjoyed the performances. The gore factor isn't as much present as it was in the first one, but it's still very much there, so just be aware that that's there, in case you're someone who gets squeamish easily or just hates seeing blood. The plot is what you would expect, but with a few twists and turns that you probably won't see coming, at least I didn't, but maybe you're more attentive than I am lol. I personally really enjoyed those plot twists, I thought they were clever and well done. The writing is pretty average for this kind of film, it's similar to the first. Oh and you also get to see some of Sarah Michelle Gellar, she racked up the horror in '97 (I know what you did last summer). 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Cotton Returns!!!,"What made this movie so good was that Cotton Weary had a major part in this film.

I give this movie ***1/2.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not as good as the first, but I liked it!","""Scream 2"" was not as good as the original ""Scream"". Scream 2 was not that bad, but I enjoyed it. The one thing I enjoy about the Scream movies is that, the killer can actually get hurt. In most slasher films, you can't even scratch the killer without him stabbing you, or cutting of your head. In the Scream movies the killer will get hurt if you hit him. He will fall if you push him. He will hurt if you cut him. At least these movies are realistic. I mostly enjoy all of the Scream movies, this one wasn't perfect, but I still enjoy it. The film is very good, but not perfect. I still enjoy this film, even if there are some things about it that I don't like. I'm going to watch ""Scream 3"" today, so I hope I enjoy it like I enjoy most of the Screams. Overall, I like this movie, and it is very enjoyable. I give it a 9 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
You thought this was the end?!,"Scream 2. You thought this was the end?! An extremely tense and intriguing continuation of the cult horror film, which leaves viewers in a constant state of anxious excitement. Director Wes Craven skillfully brings vivid nightmares and brutal murders to life on screen, making us care for each character. Screenwriter Kevin Williamson continues to play with our expectations, revealing new secrets and plot twists. Strong performances from Neve Campbell and David Arquette once again give the film realism and emotional depth. While some of the scenes may be a little minor, ""Scream 2"" still brings us into the world of horror and nerve-wracking tension. This is a film that continues to amaze with its poignancy and intensity.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great characters and suspenseful action,"Scream 2 is truly an interesting slasher flick which effectively creates sympathy for it's characters. The characters in this movie are not only smart, but they actually care for each other.  There are problems though. The movie seems to loose track of where and how the killer gets where he is. They put them in most places at once or gives them very little time to get there from where they were earlier. And how does the killer get everyone's phone number? And how does he jam a door so no one else can escape yet he escapes when he needs to? I was kinda hoping  this movie would answer some of these questions. But I like how they give the killer personality. HE's not dull but scarier than most killers and more interesting than Michael Myers in halloween: H20.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Honestly... It's better than the 1st film,"Even though this could not exist without the foundation of the 1st movie I think this surpasses it in almost every way. The kills are better, bloodier and gorier. The way in which they give the ""Scream"" treatment to the 1st scream movie is quite simply hysterical and had me entertained throughout as well as the characters who by this time have definitely grown into their roles a bit. I think people have overrated the 1st one to the point they think it's a legendary, great film but I thought it was just okay and horror is my favorite genre (my personal favorite horror films: Pieces, Ebola Syndrome, Cannibal Holocaust, Seeding of a Ghost, Halloween 1&2, The Thing). This is where the series really grabbed my interest.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

What the...  ?,"Are you people retarded or just plain stupid?  ""No likable characters"", ""no suspense"", ""poor performance by Neve Campbell""...  What the hell are you people on?  This is by far THE best horror sequel of all time.  Much more solid than ever before, the horror genre reached it's peak with this film's release.  Someone here wrote that the killers were not significant to the story....  Hum, did you even WATCH the movie, or did you just scan through it?  The killers here were even more relevant than in the first one. Granted, it couldn't have happened without the first one, but darn...  Also someone wrote that there is one death every five minutes.  Were you drunk when you watched the movie?  After the first ten minutes, there's not a death scene in over an hour.  I loved the first one, and to try to top it was a little too much to ask for.  But this movie gave one heck of a fight to try to do it, and I personally think it did in fact top it.  The person who wrote that Wes Craven never has likable characters...  You need to get those arrows out of your ass.  Johnny Depp and Heather Langenkamp from ""Nightmare on Elm Street""?  Julie in ""Wes Craven's New Nightmare""?  Angela Bassett in ""Vampire in Brooklyn""?  And ALL the characters in ""Scream"" and ""Scream 2""?  Even the bitchy ones were rendered entertaining.  I was left literally with my mouth wide open while reading your comments.  You trash brilliant movies like this, and praise such idiotic, trashy and terrible films like ""The Waterboy"", ""Big Daddy"" and other complete and utter s***. I can't wait for ""Scr3am"", because they say it's more mature than the two others, which is just what this series needs; one more excellent entry to make this the best horror series in history.  Praise Wes Craven, Kevin Williamson, Neve Campbell, and everybody else attached to either films.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Sequel That Slashes Expectations,"Scream 2 proves that sequels don't have to suck. Wes Craven came back and brought the heat AGAIN, delivering a follow-up that's not just scary but smart, witty, and straight-up fun. It's rare that a slasher sequel pulls off what Scream 2 does, and it deserves all the praise for keeping us guessing and on the edge of our seats.Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is back and even more of a boss. She's dealing with the trauma of the first movie, trying to live her college life, and boom-Ghostface shows up to ruin everything. The tension is ramped up, and Sidney's character development is top-tier. She's stronger, smarter, and totally ready to face whatever comes her way.David Arquette as Dewey and Courteney Cox as Gale Weathers are just as fun to watch as ever. Their chemistry and bickering never get old, and Gale's sharp wit is still one of the best parts of the movie. Plus, their characters go through real development, making you care about what happens to them even more.The kills in Scream 2? Iconic. The movie theater scene in the opening is wild-it literally kicks off the movie with a bang. And throughout the film, the suspense is turned up a notch, making you second-guess everyone's motives. The meta-humor is back, too, with hilarious and clever references to sequels and horror movie rules, but Scream 2 does it without feeling repetitive.The supporting cast is loaded with great performances, including a young Sarah Michelle Gellar and Jerry O'Connell. They all bring something fresh to the mix, but the focus stays on the OG crew, which is what fans want. The ""who's the killer"" mystery is even trickier this time, and the final reveal? Let's just say it's as satisfying as the original.The reason it's getting a 9/10 from me and not a perfect score is because some parts lean a little heavy into the sequel clichés (even though that's kinda the point), but the overall execution is too good to knock it down too much.Bottom line-Scream 2 is one of the best horror sequels out there. It delivers more thrills, more laughs, and more Ghostface without ever feeling like a cash grab. It's a killer follow-up in every way. 9/10-because it's slasher perfection.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

It was okay.,"I thought that ""Scream 2"" had some good points and some bad points.  Some parts were better than the original ""Scream"" and some were not.  I cannot say that I liked this film better or worse than the first one, but I can define some of the points I liked and disliked.First of all, I liked that this movie had more of a plot to it.  The original just kind of went along without much of a story, but the killer(s) in this movie actually had a real motive.   It was not as graphic as the original ""Scream.""I did not like this movie because it was not as scary as the first.  It tried to copy some of the original scares, but everybody was used to them already.  They tried to make the beginning better, but it did not have as much of an effect on people.All in all, I liked this movie.  If you were a fan of the first movie, and even if you were not, I recommend renting it.  You should see the first movie first, because it goes back and the mystery has to do with the original killings.  Most people did not like it as well, but I still recommend renting it.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Almost as good as the first ""Scream""","I am a huge fan of the first ""Scream"" film - I've watched it more times than I can count in the short 25 years that I've been alive on this cruel earth. However, I never remember having particularly fond feelings toward its sequel; because of that, I decided to give it a rewatch to see if my feelings have changed. Lo and behold, I found my timbers shivered as I began to enjoy this movie almost as much as the first.If there's one thing Wes Craven knew how to direct, it was tension filled death sequences, and that holds true in this sequel. From the very first stabbing that takes place in a movie theatre to the very last, Craven kept me on the edge of my seat, making me not quite sure how, when, or where, someone would bite the dust. Keeping the tradition of brutality alive, Ghostface is as merciless as ever - he stabs through walls, striking with exact precision; he throws people off buildings after first toying with them and slicing their body open; he stabs people multiple times, clearly relishing in the bloodshed. Ghostface is a killer with a bloodlust, and Craven's patented tension building techniques have a tendency to amplify the intensity of the action and the fright-level of the scares. And if you find yourself having a bit of a bloodlust as well, your thirst will certainly be quenched here.The thing that elevates ""Scream 2"" past typical slashers, however, is really its cast of characters. Virtually everyone who survived the happenings of the previous film is back, and all of them have grown through their trauma, becoming stronger, more serious characters as a result. Neve Campbell is gorgeous as ever in her role as Sidney Prescott - more than that, though, is the way her character has progressed from the first ""Scream"" to this one. No longer the shaky, timid, scared girl she was, Sidney is now a stronger, more confident woman who isn't afraid to stand up to Ghostface. Dewey, portrayed by David Arquette, also displays noticeable change, as he isn't the bumbling, overly polite deputy he was previously. Courteney Cox and Jamie Kennedy also return, both with engaging performances and plenty to contribute.And really, what sets ""Scream 2"" apart is not only the characters but the people who are playing them. The acting in this movie is seriously better than it has any right to be for a slasher flick. Everyone plays their parts to perfection, not letting even an ounce of cheese seep into their performance. Craven seemingly realizes that audiences become more engaged when characters act believable, and so his direction of the actors certainly makes a noticeable difference.When it comes to what ""Scream 2"" gets wrong, the only real disappointment for me is the way it handles the reveal of who Ghostface is. Not that it isn't surprising, but I felt a little underwhelmed, especially when compared to the maniacal gratuitous punch that the reveal in the first ""Scream"" had. That said, it doesn't take away from the fact that 85% of this movie is on par with the original, proving that sometimes the sequel doesn't have to suck.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"While lacking the spark of the original, Scream 2 still feels worthy enough as a continuation of the franchise","After the success of the original, the sequel entered development as quickly as possible. A year later, Scream 2 came out in theaters and turned a profit despite competition with James Cameron's blockbuster Titanic and while not as well received as the original, it's considered by many to be one of the best horror sequels as time went by.A lot of time had passed since the events of Woodsboro, California, but a killer is on the loose once again only this time at a college in Ohio. Sidney, Randy, Dewey and the other college students including Cotton played by Liev Schreiber are being attacked and they must find out who the actual killer is before they'll end up being killed.Scream 2 managed to be quite as good as the first although the original is still the best. However, before I can give this some praise there are some problems that brought the film down. First of all, the story is hit and miss. On a positive note, it does a nice job expanding on certain aspects of the first including having Billy Loomis's mother appear and it still managed to have some funny comedy and some scary chills that the original film offered. Also I like it's social commentary on sequels. Unfortunately, everything else is just a retread of the original with the killer reveal being not as fresh this time around. Even the pacing's not that good. Don't get me wrong. I liked the beginning and the climax of the film despite being somewhat predictable and cliched as it does bring some intensity when Sidney fights against Billy Loomis's mother and Mickey. Unfortunately, it's not very brisk enough and kind of dragged the film for a while.That being said, everything else is still good. The acting, much like the original, is very good from all involved as Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courtney Cox, and others including Liev Schreiber, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Laurie Metcalf, Jada Pinkett Smith give some very good performances as well. The characters are still likeable and even the new additions despite having limited screen time are still interesting enough. The direction is really neat, the cinematography is well spent and Marco Beltrami's score, much like the original, suited the atmosphere, suspense, and tone really well.Overall, while Scream 2 lacks the spark and retreads the first film, it's still a worthy enough sequel. Check it out and you won't regret it.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Worthy Sequel,"Scream 2 lives up to the original and delivers just what we want. The blood spills everywhere, the question of who it is remains intact yet again.

Sydney is really to fight again, and she gets the chance. Gale's new cameraman is a black dude who knows that brothers never survive so he books it. Cotton, the man Sydney accused of killing her mother, pops up. He wants to get his innocence spread around with a TV special. And then there's good ol' Ghostface, with his mean calls and enlongated mask. Good times.

Top Slasher Flick,"Well I was blown away by this brilliant Slasher flick, I had just seen Know What You Did Last Summer the week before and I thought what has happened to slasher films but SCREAM 2 is the best slasher flim I have ever seen.  In 20 years time people are going to be talking about how good it still is much like how the original Halloween, Friday The 13th and A Nighmare On Elm Street are still good.  Scream was very good that film, in Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson re-created the slasher ganre and in fine style but Scream 2 took the next step to the hall of fame of slasher movies.  The story line of the second one is so much better than the original it is not funny.  With Kevin Williamson now starting work on the 3rd Scream to finish his and Wes Craven's involved in creating the next great slasher movies.  Of course even though Wes and Kevin will not be involved in making a 4,5 or 6, I think we know that Mirmax will not stop at just 3 Scream's but Mirmax will have to go on and create 6 or 7 of them.  If the 3rd one is half as good as Scream 2 it will be a great film.  Everyone go and see Scream 2 Now.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Loved it when I was a kid, today it's okay.","Scream 1 and 3 are more enjoyable than this seqiel to me, mostly because there's not too many memorable scenes except for a couple deaths and the intro...my biggest complaint is why does the Sorority take Sidneys boyfriend and torture him then party? It's absolutely weird, aren't those girls supposedly good girls? I don't know. Not too interested to know why they had the whole sorority kidnap party thing...Besides that, Jerry O'Connell and Neve Campbell have no connection or chemistry it seems like...BAD couple choice! overall this film is still better than ALOT of the late 90s horror films. Not a bad film at all.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Much Much better than Scream,"I mean don't get me wrong, I loved Scream but Scream 2 had a much better plot line, and much better acting. In Scream they spoofed the horror and it wasn't scary yet it was funny. In Scream 2 they made a horror movie, not a comedy. I thought it was not as gory and it had more scares, and thrills than Scream did.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not bad.,"The first one was brilliant but its material is easy to repeat and it's originality runs out quickly. Given that, this was as good a sequel as they could have made, although the media references stopped about halfway through. Great performances from the survivors (Courteney Cox and Jamie Kennedy, especially) and the newcomers (Elise Neal and Jerry O'Connell are very charming).

Great sequel!,"At the time of it's release a lot people I know didn't like it at all. I have no idea why either. The lines are funny, the cast good and it even has it's scary moments. I have no idea why they did part 3 without Kevin Williamson doing the screen-play. His scripts made the movies clever, funny and down to earth. Plus the cast in part 3 is laughable compared to the telented cast in 1 and 2. I mean in this one you got David Arquette ""in no doubt his best role"", Neve Campbell ""in possibly her best role as well"", Courtney Coxx, Liev Shrieber, Jamie Kennedy, Jada Pinkett Smith, Timothy Olyphant ""Go!"", Jerry O'Connell, Omar Epps and Sarah Michelle Gellar.

Almost Lives Up To The Original,"'Scream 2' almost lived up to the original. The only reason it does not is because of the killers and the lame motive at the end. Apart from that minor flaw, 'Scream 2' is fantastic.It has just as much suspense but the film doesn't trap you like the first one did. It had as much, maybe even more gore than the original. Plus, more killings can't be too bad. Craven does a good job at the directing and Williamson does well with the script, making it hip and interesting.If you liked the original 'Scream' then you should check the sequel out...you probably wont be disappointed.Scream 2: 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Great movie. How many horror movies can say that about their sequels?,"This was a cool follow-up to the scary Scream. It tells about the survivers from the first movie. It has Sidney being stalked again by a different psycho while she's at college. It has great action sequences and some really good scares but, of course, it's not as good as the first. The end of the first was better than this but the end will have you on the edge of your seat also. It's really hard to guess who is stalking  Sidney because you really wouldn't know even if you went down the whole list of the cast. It's someone that isn't even the person you wouldn't think. It has a really good plot and great acting and it's really good because most horror sequels suck so much. It's fun and at the same time frightful. Scream 2: B+",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Its time to ""Scream"" for a second time!","Although i did really enjoy ""Scream 2"" i feel that it didn't have the same spark as the first one. The surviving cast Members return, Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, David Arquette and Jamie Kennedy, as well as being joined by new people Jade Pinkett (smith), Sarah Michelle 'Buffy' Gellar, Jerry O Connel and Elise Neal. The film starts with another Scary opener and its with Jada Pinkett and her boyfriend waiting to see ""Stab"", its a movie based on the murders that happened in Woodsboro a year earlier, but not much to their knowledge their life will be a scary movie in the movie theatre, In the film ""Stab"" they are watching Heather Graham is re acting Drew Barrymores performance as Casey Becker. Jada is playing Maureen Evans a bright young Women and hates scary movies. after her boyfriend is killed hes after her but the audience think thats its a funny stunt, but it turns out not to be funny at all when she dies in front of 200 people. When than see a familiar face Sidney Prescott, shes now at college with her new best friend Hallie played by Elise Neal and now Sid discovers its happening all over again. We than get introduced to Sidneys new Boyfriend Derek played by Jerry O Connel and too Woodsboro survivors Dewey and Randy. suddenly out of no where Courtney Cox is back as Gail Weathers and she brought along Cotten Weary because she wants Sidney to talk about what happened the year before, Sid is not happy and walks away. The next scene is about a young blonde Girl named Casey ""CICI"" Cooper played by the ever sexy Sarah Michelle Gellar. She is alone because shes waiting to pick up her drunk Friends from a party. She is talking to her Friend on the phone when someone is beeping in, its the killer and she starts being harassed just like Casey Becker in ""Scream"", Gellar was outstanding in this movie as every other thing she does but I'm a huge fan of her work and everything that she does (Buffy, i know what you did last summer) and i was pleased that she was in this movie. after the killer adds her to his death list, he is after Sidney and she is attacked at a party while everyone has gone to investigate the murder of Cici. than her boyfriend goes after the killer and is than put up as a suspect. basically Mrs Loomis has come after Sidney because she killed Billy and she has a student helping her with the murders. with help from Gail and Cotten, everything turns out to be fine! plus the Killer is killing people with similar names to the original victims which gives the film a brilliant twist. although this wasn't as good, it still is one of my favs!three cheers for: Neve Campbell- Always brilliant in these films! Sarah Michelle Gellar- shes amazing in everything that she does and I'm her biggest fan plus shes HOT in this film Courtney Cox- proved once again that she can play other roles and not be Monica all the time.David Arquette was AWFUL! i don't know why they don't kill him off, he is a terrible actor and the the way he ""Walks"" because of his stab wound from the last movie makes him look even worse of an actor.anyway like i said 9/10! its worth seeing over and over again!amazing camera work from Wes Craven, he truly is the suspense master!!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Wes Craven has done it again!,"You have to admit, Wes Craven is one of the best writers of all time, with his ""Nightmare on Elm street"" and ""Friday the 13th"" you just need to admit, Wes has got it all.

Wes has always done something great, but this is definitely, 1 of his great movies, 2 thumbs up!!!!!!! Its got thrills, horror, humor and fun., Scream 2 is #1! Scream 2 is a Must see film!!!!! Good Job Wes! The movie opens in a theater. The movie 'Stab' is showing for the first time and this movie is based on the book 'The Woodsboro Murders' by Gale Weathers. In 'Scream' Sidney predicted that Tori Spelling would probably play her if they would ever make a movie about those events and in 'Scream 2' we learn she was right.

The Best Horror Movie I've Seen,"`The Craven for Terror' Scream2: rated R, 2 hours and 2 minutesAs stated in the movie by actor Timothy Olyphant (Mickey), `History repeats itself.' Scream1 and 2 each have certain elements and scenes that are rest assured not coincidentally almost exactly alike. For instance, Dewey, Gale, and Sydney are your typical Scream heroes, (or at least it looks as though they are). A question asked during both movies is `Did the boyfriend do it?' You've got to be a certified genius to figure out who the killer is in this murder mystery, because in short, everyone's a suspect!The sensational teenage cast plays a big role in bringing Scream2 to its full potential. Jada Pinkett, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jerry O' Connell, Liev Schreiber, David Arquette, Courtney Cox, Tori Spelling, and of course, Neve Campbell are what make up this phenomenal cast of Gen. X's. The scenes are gripping as each one takes you on a trip through terror lane, using each important character as your tour guide for the intense adventure.Though the movie is exceedingly interesting, it is obviously not the most realistic movie. Everything revolves around killings, and key word, possible killings. Even so, Scream2 isn't so far from reality (okay, it is, but Craven did his best anyway); the outrageous parts were done to look as believable as possible.As many more people were killed in the sequel than were in the previous movie, (remember, all second flicks have twice the mayhem), which has proved that the more murdered, the merrier. Characters were literally torn apart, and the audiences liked it, despite how gruesome it may sound, it definitely caught their attention, and it certainly caught mine!Scream2, directed by Wes Craven, also starring Elise Neal, has earned it's A in the ever lasting genre of horror movies.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Top quality sequel,"The first movie raised the bar on teen slasher horror movies and this one doesn't disappoint either (although I am surprised by its relative low rating score).It picks up two years after the first where the teenage survivors are at university, Cotton Weary is out of prison proven innocent, Gail Weathers is trying to interview Sid and Cotton about the past and then more killings begin. The film quickly reverts back to the formula that did so well in the first film with a bait and switch who done it. Along the way it pokes fun at the horror genre in clever dialogue without watering down the horrors. It also gives itself plenty of opportunity for famous cameos (see how many you can spot).All in all a top quality sequel and probably where it should have ended.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A 'Good' Sequel,"An entertaining movie, but not as strong as the original. The plot closely followed the original, but the twists were more predictable this time. The movie within a movie concept did not speak to me very well, and this would set a negative trend for the rest of the franchise. The meta dialogue was slightly overused, the reason being it was less subtle. The story progression was good, although I would have liked to see more kill scenes during the film. The theme of this movie is likely revenge and tying up loose ends. I think the killers in this movie had clear motives, and it did not stray too far from the original Scream. The acting and dialogue were more sloppy than in the original, but still good. I was not impressed with the cinematography and background of the film; it felt more cramped than the first movie. There were opportunities to expand the set, but the directors chose not to use them. The soundtrack was good; a few moments where I noticed it more than I would have liked to, but it was still good. Overall, this was a good movie with a story to tell but stood much shorter than the original.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

It has a fun setting, an incredible cast, so many quotable lines, and insightful meta commentary on sequels.

Let's talk about media!,"Scream 2 is a more refined, even if less powerful movie in comparison with the first smashing one. It goes deeper into the debate about the importance of media communication, but obviously it is very far from the various films of the genre (i.e. Network). It is symbolic in most of its features, as strongly demonstrated by the real killer, who is, or seems to be a journalist. Craven and Williamson also underline how media, and not violent movies, can bring young generation to psychic disease. It is not a case that Gale Weathers renounces to her scoop for Linus (it is symbolic, not sentimental). Wonderful, of course the scene in the studios where, behind a glass, Gale meets Linus' hand. It a love declaration for cinema and everything that deals with it!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Rules for a Horror Sequel,"""Scream 2"" is an exception to Jamie Kennedy's Randy's quip that ""sequels suck."" Later, this film-theory student explains the rules of sequels. Although he specifies that they're the rules for horror films, and we may assume specifically slasher ones, there's really only one rule, and it applies to sequels regardless of genre. Neither, as Randy says, are they by definition inferior. These follow-ups are by definition more--more of, or from, the original. It could be higher body counts, more elaborate death scenes, new locations and characters, more of anything and many things. As here, it could mean even more meta-ness. The first ""Scream"" (1996) relied on acknowledging itself as a movie and thereby relishing in or subverting genre expectations by way of referencing other slasher flicks. I think ""Psycho"" (1960) and ""Halloween"" (1978) were particularly important in this regard. Indeed, we get more such references here, but Kevin Williamson, Wes Craven and company seem to have realized that wouldn't quite work again as the principle root of the reflexivity. Instead, the focal point becomes the first ""Scream."" More of it.Indeed, there are two such films now, the real ""Scream"" and the film-within-the-film, ""Stab."" The latter even stars the very actress that Neve Campbell's Sidney remarked in the first film that she feared would play her in a movie, Tori Spelling. Amusingly, other recognizable real actors star in ""Stab,"" Heather Graham in the Drew Barrymore part and Luke Wilson as the killer boyfriend. There's considerable young talent in the outer film, as well, especially from TV shows. Buffy the Vampire Slayer gets a Drew Barrymore-like scene, the likes of Dawson's friend Pacey may be spotted attending the film theory class, Roseanne's sister is a reporter, and Sidney is dating that ""Sliders"" guy this time around. The franchise seems to have been quite adept at using this pool of boob-tube talent, as of course Campbell came from ""Party of Five,"" Courtney Cox from ""Friends"" (there's a good Jennifer Aniston joke in the movie, too, by the way), and whatever else whomever else was in.The opening scene sets the entire tone again, as Barrymore's phone conversation about liking scary movies did the first go around. There's also a concerted effort to appeal to a broader audience with a more diverse cast that includes some African Americans. Thus, Jada Pinkett and Omar Epps attending the premiere of ""Stab"" and mocking the whiteness of it--meaning that of the first ""Scream."" The first kills also address the very real controversy over such titles as ""Scream"" inspiring real-life copycats. This is how the following film class discussion begins, too. I'm not quite sure if this is gutsy, clever self-awareness, a rebuke of the controversy, or a mere thumbing of the nose--probably all four. I do know this was before the Columbine massacre and that after that the same studio, Miramax, locked up at least one violent teen flick that I saw recently, ""O"" (2001).Aside from the randomness of a sorority girl murder, I also like how this opening sets the tone of the killer--or, is it killers again, or is the whodunnit aspect just a silly plot device not worth much consideration (methinks it the latter)--targeting the characters who attempt to decipher the movie. Besides Epps and Pinkett's characters, this is basically just the foursome returning from the first film, but there's a reason they were the survivors. In essence, they answered the slasher trivia game correctly that Barrymore's victim failed.That's the heroine subverting the genre expectations of the virginal goody-two-shoes, Sidney. The film buff Randy explaining the genre. Cox's Gale Weathers, TV tabloid journalist and author of the book that's turned into the movie ""Stab."" She's the in-film author of the first ""Scream,"" in addition to directing its cameraman and even taking the camera into her own hands. And, the Barney Fife deputy (David Arquette) there for the perfunctory whodunnit angle. Sidney had already inherited her centrality in this conflict from her mother, whereas the other three were mere bystanders who got caught up in the last plot. Their newfound sharing of this becoming central characters instead of just sideline interpreters of the plot is especially apt as Ghostface comes to represent cinema, the monster-as-movie. That wasn't the case last time; there, if anything, he was a movie being made, but now the monster is the movie.Much of the rest of the reflexivity is derived from this notion. Sidney isn't just the star and the source of the star in the inner film, she's also a drama major starring in the play-within-the-play, which reflects the outer narrative of her as the prophesizing Cassandra of Troy and of a repeat of the Woodsboro murders. Gale isn't just narrating the story or a part of it, but also a surrogate spectator--going to the tapes and watching Ghostface through the window of the sound-recording booth. The killings, or attempted ones, take place at a movie theatre, a TV van, a projection room, the sound and editing rooms, through windows and on the stage. Masked madmen don't get more theatrical than that, or their victims more cinematically literate, for that matter.Aside from pushing postmodernism to its limits, I still don't think the characters compelling beyond that. The romance between Gale and the deputy Dewey is built up more, but otherwise, and for a picture that's nominally so much about grief and trauma, I don't recall Dewey's late sister, gruesomely slain last time, being mentioned once here. Just goes to show, however, that movies aren't really about life; they're about themselves--movies about movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hell freezes over; I liked a sequel,"One comment I read said that they didn't like sequels, but who does.  Well, SOMEBODY must like them, otherwise Hollywood wouldn't keep on churning the bloody things out!!!  With rare exceptions, I am not one of them, and so I was surprised to like this film, which I saw instead of THE RAINMAKER that night.  It's just as funny and surprising, and almost as scary, as the original.  Some have complained about who the killers were, and sure, logic wise, it's a bit creaky, but in the sense that this is an homage to horror films (slasher films in particular), it makes perfect sense.

this should've been the last,"After the huge success with the best horror of all time, Scream, Wes Craven comes back with the sequel: Scream 2. Unlike most of the sequels, this one does not suck. Actually it's a very good movie. But not as good as the original. 2 years after the events in the first film, the terror starts again for Sidney. A killer copycats the murders from Woodsboro, exactly in the week of the premiere of Stab, movie made after the events in the first part.Scream 2 does a very good job with the story and the action scenes: very well done and some of them very tensed. Still the phone-terror used in the first part is not that developed and scary. Except for this element, Wes keeps everything that goes well in the original. Including the very clever dialogue that worked so good in Scream.After a surprising success (nobody expected Scream 2 to be a good movie, after the fabulous first part), Wes Craven should've stopped while he was on top. But he didn't. He chose more money in stead of being the undisputed God of horror films.

Killer Sequel!,"I thought Scream was a masterpiece, so, naturally, I wanted to see Scream 2 and I expected it to be just as good. Although it was far from a masterpiece, Scream 2 is just as much fun as the first movie.It's two yeas after the gruesome Woodsboro murders and Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is enjoying a new life, a new boyfriend and new friends as a student at heavenly Windsor College. But that was before the opening night of 'Stab', the movie account of the horrific slayings at Woodsboro, based on the best-selling book written by Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox). Now a 'copycat killer' is one the rampage and wants Sidney dead, again. As the body count rises the pressure becomes unbearable. No one is safe, and everyone is a suspect.The great performers return from the first film - Neve Campbell is brilliant as Sidney, and Jamie Kennedy reprises his role as geek Randy perfect and David Arquette and Courteney Cox, who where rudely underused in the original, deserve credit for their more-developed characteristics. Wes Craven returns to the director's seat again, and he puts lots of effort into this killer sequel.

This film was definately scarier and more jumpy than the first film perhaps because I saw this in the cinema and saw the original on video.  However I still reckon the first one was better.

Almost as good as its predecessor.,"Shockingly, 'Scream 2 (1997)' isn't actually much worse than its predecessor. In fact, to phrase it more positively, it's almost just as good. Its story follows on in a natural way and its characters are as compelling as ever. Wes Craven's shrewd direction combines with Kevin Williamson's witty script to deliver an experience that's as self-aware and subversive as you'd expect. It's a really entertaining time throughout, with gripping whodunnit elements that constantly keep you on your toes. It falls down just a tad in its finale, as a couple of its reveals feel a tad 'cheap' (though, thankfully, they aren't cheats), but the affair remains enjoyable right up until its credits roll. It's filled with superbly crafted scare sequences, finely tuned sequel satirisation and, of course, several ear-piercing screams. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
