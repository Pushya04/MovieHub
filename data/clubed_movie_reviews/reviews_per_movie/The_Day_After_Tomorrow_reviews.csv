"Spectacular special effects, uneven film","The Day After Tomorrow is not a bad movie by all means. In fact, it's an uneven but decent film. The film does start off absolutely brilliantly, with a wonderful idea for a story and truly spectacular special effects. As a matter of fact, the whole film is well worth watching for the special effects alone. The acting is not too bad; Jake Gyllanhaal is rather bland, but Dennis Quaid is a superb lead. Plus Emmy Rosum looks positively radiant and Ian Holm is as reliable as ever. The direction from Roland Emmerich was surprisingly good, there have been times when I have found his direction too murky and unfocused, but no it was above decent here.However, the second half isn't as impressive. Whereas the first half is very like a typical disaster movie, the second half for me as it focused on the rescue mission felt more of a thriller. The screenplay in general could have done with more precision and focus too, there is good interplay sometimes but on the whole I found the screenplay and some of the characters underdeveloped. My main problem though with The Day After Tomorrow was the pace, for my liking it was too leisurely and too stodgy.All in all, uneven it is but it is a decent disaster movie. The first half I can watch again and again, but the second half for me was a bit of a letdown. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of the last great disaster flicks,"Roland Emmerich's The Day After Tomorrow is one of those textbook disaster flicks where every recognizable element is in full swing: determined scientist, sure of his curveball theories that no one else buys, saddled with a dysfunctional family and a clock that's quickly ticking down towards some looming cataclysm, in this case severely bat tempered weather. It's cliche after cliche, but this is one of the ones that works, and I have a theory why. These days it seems like the formula for the disaster film is pretty dead, or at least doesn't carry the same magic it did throughout the 90's and early 00's.Stuff like San Andreas, 2012, Geostorm (shudder) just feel dead on arrival, and instead we go back and revisit things like Armageddon, Independence Day, and for me, ones like this. There's a quality, a feel for time and place that got lost somewhere along the way as time passed in Hollywood, and this is one of the last few that serve as a milestone as to where that happened. The first half or so is cracking stuff, followed by a slightly underwhelming final act. Dennis Quaid is the scientist who gets all in a huff about an extreme weather front that's apparently barrelling towards the east coast, threatening to give the whole region one wet day in the park. There's an exaggerated halfwit Vice President (Kenneth Welsh) who scoffs at him, an excitable veteran professor (Bilbo Baggins) who eagerly supports him, and an estranged family right in the storm's crosshairs who he must rescue. The special effects are neat when the maelstrom slams into New York like a battering ram, pushing over buildings with walls of water and chucking hurricanes all about the place. Quaid's wife (Sela Ward) and wayward son (Jake Gyllenhaal) are of course stuck in this mess, as he races to find out what's causing it, and how to escape. The initial scenes where it arrives are big screen magic, especially when Gyllenhaal's girlfriend (Emmy Rossum) is chased down main street by a raging typhoon and barely scapes into a building, a breathless showcase moment for the film. The second half where the storm levels off isn't as engaging, despite attempts to throw in extra excitement, such as wolves, which I still can't quite figure out the origin of, despite watching the film a few times now. Holed up inside a library, it's a long waiting game in the cold dark where the writing and character development is spread a bit thin for the time they have to kill, but what can you expect here. Should have thrown in a T Tex or some ice dragons to distract us from sparse scripting. Still, the film gets that initial buildup deliciously right, the nervous windup to all out chaos, the editing between different characters and where they are when the monsoon shows up, and enough panicky surviving to make us thankful for that cozy couch and home theatre system all the more. One of the last of the finest, in terms the genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Plea For Kyoto,"I'm certainly in no position to comment on the science put forth in this film. When I was going to school, I remember being taught in science class that the Ice Age was a gradual process that took place over thousands of years and then it took thousands again to reverse it. Of course we didn't have man around using all the planet's resources for industry.But scientist Dennis Quaid says that the Ice Age will dawn upon man again and soon. But it happens a whole lot sooner than even he predicts and the nations of the world pay for it.The first half of the film is Quaid's struggle in vain to persuade our government, particularly a Vice President played by Kenneth Welsh who bears no accidental resemblance to Dick Chaney of the folly of its environmental policy.When doomsday strikes, the action shifts to Quaid trekking to New York to rescue his son Jake Gyllenhaal who is trapped in the New York Public Library with other kids from an Academic Bowl they were participating in.IF the science is open to speculation, the special effects are spectacular. Personally the sight of that freighter sailing up a flooded 42nd Street is something to behold. And the whiz kids who survive prove to be pretty resourceful.The Day After Tomorrow is Hollywood's appeal for the USA to sign and obey the Kyoto Accords. Hollywood has taken up worse causes.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Clichéd, illogical, unscientific but the first hour really delivers even if the second hour is like the 1970's never happened","After years of warning about global warning, Jack Hall is horrified to find all his predictions coming true much faster than he could have imagined. Hail stones the size of footballs decimate cities, typhoons destroy Los Angeles and New York becomes flooded. As the big freeze crosses the northern hemisphere, a small group of survivors try to fend off the cold as the world prepares for a dramatic change in the world order.This film may be a modern blockbuster but in almost everyway it is a 1970's disaster movie where an event happens after some build up and we then spend the rest of the film watching the survivors trying to, well, survive. In that regard the film carries all the usual problems that the genre carries but happily benefits from the fact that the effects are much better than 1970's movies could manage. For this reason the first hour is great  it has dramatic pace, is involving and looks fantastic even if we have seen it before in different variations (how many times has New York been destroyed now?). However after the sheer global terror is pretty much finished we suddenly become much more small scale and the film looses much of it's impact and it's pace. After the initial danger has passed the film uses illogical and silly plot devices to put the survivors at risk  a cold eye of a storm, blood infections, creeping ice and wolves are among the problems. While this is OK on a genre level it doesn't compare to the first hour and it gets a little dull and plodding at times.The clichés are all present and correct: the politicians, the upright scientists, the sacrifice, the daring rescues and so on. It's fair to say that if you are looking for more than a basic script then you will be looking in the wrong place here. All this film does is to provide spectacle and moments of dramatic action  if you want to think about it then you will only hurt your enjoyment of the action. The film tries to deliver an environmental message but in a way this film will not help the environmental movement because it is too exaggerated to be taken seriously (like the idea of Celtic and Man Utd reaching the Champions League final  during this season? Please!), however it does include several surprisingly barbed attacks on the US administration (could the VP look any more like Cheney?). Just a shame that the film message is delivered with all the subtlety that Segal showed when he did something similar in his environmental action film On Deadly Ground.The script doesn't really create characters either and it means we don't care that much about what happens to them in the final hour (countless millions are dead for goodness sake!). The dialogue in the first hour is nicely gruff and scientific and very genre but the second hour is more human and the lines aren't suited for that  not even in the hands of an impressive number of good actors. I like Quaid and he is a good lead here, he gets the good scientific stuff and only is lumbered with the rather silly notion of walking to New York from Washington. Gyllenhaal must have upset legions of cult fan boys by appearing in a big budget movie but he does OK with the role (despite looking too old to be in school). The rest of the cast are fairly mixed but, as with the genre, they are just filled even if some are good. Welsh is good even if he was cast for his similarity to Dick Cheney, Holm adds a small bit of dignity in his role as well as being supported by the very fine actor Lester in a minor role. Faces like Sanders, Mihok and a few others don't really matter as they are merely victims waiting for their turn to be used for dramatic effect.Overall the first hour of this film is good on a blockbuster level, but it blows it's wad too early (don't ya hate it when that happens?!) and is left with a second hour that is right out of the 1970's with all the weaknesses that that entails. Generally I enjoyed the film because I was just expecting a big noisy movie to pass a few hours  bad script, no characters and lots of clichés? Why would I be surprised by that? It's par for the course and you should not watch this if you know these aspects will annoy you. As it is, it's an average film but one that is noisy and spectacular enough to pass muster in the summer blockbuster stakes.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Excellent catastrophe movie by the great director Roland Emmerich,"The film deals about ice melting of the Arctic created by global weather change of the hole ozone. The movie is impressive , New York's flood is overwhelming .The plot summary centers in Dennis Quaid a climatologist who predicts disaster and he goes to looking for his son Jake Gyllenheal to New York staying all the way freezing cool fighting against amount dangers because middle United States are frozen. The F.X. of computer generator are first rate , better than the classics 7o and 80 :""earthquake"", ""Inferno towering"" and likeness to ""Volcano"" or ""Armaguedon"". Thrilling screenplay dispenses absurd excitement as well as spectacular scenes and lots of action . This is a fast-paced, stylized disaster-spectacle film . Cinematography and musical score by Harald Kloser are breathtaking .Direction by Roland Emmerich is fitting as in all spectacle film that he makes . Roland Emmerich estimated that at least 1000 digital artists worked on the film . The motion picture was well realized by Roland Emmerich . Roland made his feature length film in 1984 : ¨The Noah's ark principle¨ , he subsequently made ¨Joey¨ . In 1997 wrote, directed, and produced the critically acclaimed ""Moon 44"" . Filmmaker Roland Emmerich quickly understood the freedom and malleability that direct in USA presents and has gone about creating some incredibly interesting genre fare in ¨Universal Soldier¨, his first American movie in which displayed an acute understanding of the action genre . Roland ulteriorly directed 1994 Stargate , 1996 Independence Day , 1998 Godzilla , 2000 The Patriot , 2004 The day after tomorrow , 2008 : 10.000 , 2011 Anonymous and his last movie 2013 White House Down .Rating : 7/10 , above average.

An enjoyable 'Disaster' Film with some nice set pieces,"This Film harkens back to the old 70's Disaster flicks - taking situations and just magnifying them 1000 fold for entertainment sake. Yes, the Science here is questionable (apart from the effects of the currents being disrupted!) - it is all in the service of a storyline. The weather systems across the entire Planet are thrown into chaos by 'climate change' and it is up to Paleo-climatologist Dennis Quaid to convince all that the unthinkable is going to happen - while at the same time trying to re-bond with his estranged son - Jake Gyllenhal. All of this is hardly new but this Film does it with great dash and with a few great set pieces - the inundation of New York is superbly done and the characters are allowed to develop in quite a natural way. Unlike many of Emmerich's film (which I find overblown) this one he approaches in a more serious manner - the opening shots of Antarctica set the scene extremely well and the accompanying score by Harold Kloser is actually very haunting. All in all, an enjoyable film with some very nice performances.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel okay.","""The Day After Tomorrow"" is a disaster movie, but it isn't a disastrous one. But if Roland Emmerich really thought he was making a movie with a message, he didn't quite succeed - to be honest, Emmerich is to serious film-making as Naomi Wolf is to recommending ""Voluptuous"" magazine. The fact that the movie begins with the Twentieth Century Fox logo under stormy skies doesn't make it any more significant.Well-intentioned it may be, but the movie's plot takes second place to the imagery - the opening credits over an icy landscape, the massive weather systems over the planet, colossal hailstones pelting down on Tokyo, snowstorms over India, tidal waves - and the numerous effects houses make it an eye candy feast, especially for people with a grudge against the Big Apple (kudos to Industrial Light and Magic, Digital Domain and all the less renowned FX companies involved). So on that level, it works; the music by Harald Kloser and Thomas Wanker is also a bonus, being more restrained and serious in its support than is usually the way with Emmerich movies.And then there's the script - it has a whole load of characters but doesn't do much with any of them. Example: Climatologist Dennis Quaid's relationship with son Jake Gyllenhaal doesn't seem to be as estranged as it's intended to be, and similarly the friendship Quaid has with a longtime colleague gets about as much emphasis as the crush his younger colleague has on fellow scientist Tamlyn Tomita (and the movie pays for it later on in a sequence shamelessly ripped off from ""Vertical Limit,"" which has little of the emotional resonance it should). In fact, all the human elements - Gyllenhaal's repressed feelings for classmate Emmy Rossum, his doctor mother Sela Ward's problems with a young patient, etc - all of them are underdeveloped or just plain undeveloped, and some moments practically scream ""Contrived Climax Ahoy!""Those moments are there because ""The Day After Tomorrow"" doesn't have an enemy as a natural outgrowth of its story; the elements aren't really villainous as they have no concept of right or wrong, and the closest thing to a villain here is the current administration in the White House, so Emmerich and co-writer Jeffrey Nachmanoff have to impose a tangible enemy (why else are those wolves there?) on the proceedings. This does help things from getting totally boring in the second half, though it's still pretty watchable even then - but if some more thought had been put into the screenplay, like exploring the characters or developing the promising ideas therein (like Americans fleeing to Mexico, or further looks at the Government side), it would have carried more weight and made the movie into more than an improvement on ""Godzilla.""As it is, it's a competently done if implausible attention-holder that wants to be more; that it actually had the potential to be more makes it a bit of a disappointment, but at least it's a watchable one.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Extreme Weather Horror: A Realistic View of Nature's Threats,"Ancient meteorologist Jack Hall warned of massive disasters due to global warming. His research became a reality, and in a few months, extreme weather events would hit New York, Los Angeles, Tokyo, and London.Personally, I was fascinated by the film's overwhelming visual beauty. The scene where New York freezes and the moment when a massive tsunami engulfs the city are particularly stunning. The frozen image of the Statue of Liberty truly symbolizes the end of humanity and is a real horror. I was amazed at how realistic the threat of nature was.While watching the movie, I often wondered what I would do if I were in this situation. If an ice age hits the Earth, would I be able to survive? When I think about this, I get a lot of buzz in my mind.The message of the movie that resonated most with me was that ""The ability to judge and choose the right information is important."" With so much information today, it's hard to know what's really right. The characters are forced to make choices in difficult circumstances, and they show us the importance of continuing to improve ourselves.Throughout the film, there are thrilling developments, powerful visuals, and deep messages. The content makes you think even after watching it, and it reminds you of the knowledge and experience you'll need in the coming age.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Come on people.,"How many times do I need to read other's reviews on disaster films before I remember most people on here writing these think they are actual film critics? It is a disaster movie. Yes, the science is terrible. Yes the coincidences are fantastical. If you watch these for ground breaking stories with rich plots, or for an Oscar worthy performance by one of the actors, then you are watching these for the wrong damn reasons.
This movie shows a future where due to the rise in global temperatures, a modern ice age is triggered. How it is ushered in is by these violent, giant hurricane-like storms that cause flash freezing, and bring in a myriad of disasters with them. These include tsunamis and blizzards that drop so many feet of snow that people are walking level with the signs on the interstate that you would normally drive under. It also tries to throw in a lot of relatable human elements, such as the struggle of a man that is an absentee parent because of his job, trying to connect with his son, a lonely boy dying of cancer, and just the human death that this kind of disaster would bring.
Do not watch this for the science, though I do feel that they had the causation of another ice age correct. Do not watch this for deep plot. Watch this for the enjoyable ride on which it takes you.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Fair As A Summer Blockbuster But Still Flawed,"If I ever get a job as a screen writing guru I shall tell my students that under no circumstances should they write an environmental thriller . Films with a message that we're destroying the planet do not make good cinematic ventures . NO BLADE OF GRASS is annoyingly sententious but is still compelling due to John Christopher's source novel . SOYLENT GREEN is poignant but much of that's down to it being Edward G Robinson's last movie . Do I need to mention Steven Segall and his pathetic attempts to entertain while educating us and failing at both ? I don't think I doThe problem with THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is that its trying to do two things at once . Both entertain the audience and get them to think about global environmental disaster . One can't help thinking that if there wasn't so much debate about climate change then the producers would have made a much simpler movie . Unfortunately by taking the film so seriously a critical audience are able to recognise the scientific implausibilities along with the stupidity of the characters . Of course there's little wrong with having stupid characters in films because many genres like horror rely on this to further plots , but even so you can't help noticing a lack of internal logicAnother problem is that the film does feel a bit too epic in its scope . We're shown events happening in The South Pole , India , North America and Scotland . Personally I would have preferred a much more intimate film with less locations and characters . This is the strength of the 1970s disaster movie where the characters are drawn up early in to the film so the audience can clearly cheer the hero whilst booing the villainI rated THE DAY AFTER Tomorrow six out of ten which means I didn't think it was a bad film .

"Not Awful, But Badly Flawed","The build up to this disaster film is somehow far better than the aftermath. We are introduced to the main characters, told about their quirks, special talents, etc. and the scene is setup nicely for a damn enjoyable film.

It quite simply becomes boring to watch and although the acting among the survivors is talented and believable it doesn't stop you thinking there should be more to enjoy. As usual for the genre, some of the science is flawed, and although this is often forgivable, the failure to keep the audience entertained, only makes them think about these flaws all the more.Ultimately 'The Day After Tomorrow' peaks too soon, and rather then build to a climax, it's over way before we are satisfied.6/10 should have been way better",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""Always something to eat in the garbage!""","What an annoying movie! The Day After Tomorrow is filled with every disaster movie cliché in the book. Why does there have to be a child with cancer who is too ill to move as the impending doom threatens? Why is it necessary to have people fall in love during the middle of a crisis? Why should we care about characters that are only on screen for a few minutes before they die? Why does the homeless guy know more about what's going on than most anyone else? Why did the parents in the movie have to be estranged, only to resolve their differences as the disaster strikes? Why does the Dick Cheney look-alike Vice-President, the most prominent government official, have to be such a narrow minded character? If you've seen on disaster movie, you've no doubt run into a few of these examples of the lack of originality found in The Day After Tomorrow. Most every event and character reaction to those events can be predicted with incredible accuracy.On top of the clichés, plot points are handled in such heavy-handed fashion. Director Roland Emmerich will suddenly show scenes and events that are totally unrelated to anything that is going on. You just know the minute you discover that the wolves have escaped from the zoo that they'll inevitably come back to create an even more dangerous situation for the people in the movie. Why else would the scene of a couple of zookeepers discovering the empty cages be included in the movie? And you know the minute that one of the characters gets hurt trying to save someone that her injury will come back to haunt her. Why else would we get a quick glimpse of her bleeding underwater? As a viewer, you're literally beat over the head with these plot points in an incredibly ham-fisted manner. As I said earlier, it's all so annoying.I suppose that if you're into CGI you might find a thing or two to enjoy. The special effects are, for the most part, well done. But the special effects completely dominate everything else. It's CGI overload. Why even bother with actors? The actors don't act in The Day After Tomorrow. They spend their time reacting to special effects that were generated long after they were finished with the movie. Once again, it's annoying.Finally, did anyone ever think for a moment that the people trapped in the library were in any real danger? If you thought for a second that Jake Gyllenhaal or Emmy Rossum's characters were in any real danger, you've apparently never seen a movie before. Why should I care about these two character (or anyone else for that matter) when you can spot who's going to live and who's going to die 10 minutes into the movie? For the last time, it's annoying.I'll stop here as there are really so many other annoying facets of the movie I could cover that I could write pages. I haven't scratched the surface.

I'm gonna head to the bathroom and take a Day After Tomorrow,"Do you like a good old-fashioned action-packed Summer movie with a good story and scientific accuracy? Welp, you best keep on looking because you won't find those ingredients in ""The Day After Tomorrow.""This is one of those movies where the entertainment value is in how much you can make fun of it. And believe me, Stephanie, Mr. Shade, and I poked fun at the movie for the entire two hours. What else can you do with a movie this ridiculous? I'll admit the special effects are really good. The problem is that they're used up in the first half of the movie. I was expecting a full 2 hours of action and chaos, but they got all that out of the way and the rest of the movie focuses on the characters and their attempts to survive.How cheesy is this movie? Let me count the ways...1) Gyllenhaal supposedly fails his math class because on his final exam he only wrote the answers. He did all the work in his head, you see. That's just how much of a genius he is. So he and Quaid determine the teacher just failed him because he's jealous. Um, when I was in school I had to show my work. Sorry to be the bad guy here, but it's easy to see why the teacher might be suspicious. But this is a final exam, so wouldn't this issue have been addressed earlier? Sigh. I thought for sure later in the movie Gyllenhaal was gonna save the world but he was gonna figure it out in his head so the movie wouldn't have to explain to us how he did it. Thankfully, the movie didn't get quite that extreme.2) This movie leads us to believe that a tornado warning cannot be issued until turning on the news and checking the weather report.3) You gotta love the overdramatic delivery of dialogue: ""Looks like a hurricane."" *dramatic pause* ""Only hurricanes DON'T FORM OVER LAND!""4) The temperature supposedly starts to drop 10 degrees per minute. Riiiiiiiight. So within an hour the temperature would be 600 degrees below zero? And as the temperature starts dropping, we see everything freezing. Particularly ridiculous is when Gyllenhaal and his buddies are in a library and we see the floor freezing and chasing after them. They manage to jump in a room and close the door JUST IN TIME! For some reason the door magically shields them from the cold. Whatever.5) Quaid and his friends are able to survive walking in sub-zero temperatures with little more than parkas and gloves. And they have these tents that apparently have magical warming powers because once in the tents they're able to take off their gloves and hats and not be cold at all!I could go on, but I think you get it. Ohhh, and what was the point of Quaid walking all the way from D.C. to New York just to find his son? He knew his son was holed up in the library, and he didn't show up with a rescue squad or anything to take him home. Oh yeah, he made a promise. Mr. Shade leaned over to me and said, ""If I ever promise you that I'll meet you at the movie theater and the whole world freezes over, then don't expect me to be there."" Fair enough. It was obviously supposed to add an emotional element to the story, but it did nothing for me. Quaid should've just waited and taken a helicopter to New York after the storm died down. It would've been better than risking his and his partners' lives.I could write a thesis on the absurdity of the science used in the movie, but I won't bore you. There are plenty of articles by climatologists you can read that state how the events in the movie are impossible, especially a glaciation of this magnitude occurring in three days and catching the ENTIRE WORLD by surprise. Folks, Memphis weathermen interrupt my regularly scheduled programming whenever a drop of rain is registered, so you better believe they'd be on top of this.Let me just add that this movie is based on the book, ""The Coming Global Superstorm"" by Art Bell and Whitley Strieber. Strieber wrote another book called ""Communion,"" in which he claims he was told of the Earth's upcoming apocalypse by aliens. If that's who you wanna get your science from then go ahead. I hope you'll excuse me while I point and laugh at you.I feel sorry for fringe groups who are actually using this movie to tout their political agenda. Saying this is a movie people should watch to prepare for a possible global warming catastrophe is about as legitimate as saying people should watch ""Dawn of the Dead"" to prepare for what would happen if zombies attacked. I'd say they're on equal ground in regard to scientific accuracy. But I doubt too many moviegoers are gonna take this seriously.There's so much more to make fun of, but I'm gonna stop myself. I was extremely disappointed in the movie, so there's a good chance you will be also. This is the type of movie that shows a weatherman get hit by a huge billboard during the middle of the storm, and the only emotion it prompts is laughter. You've been warned.""The Day After Tomorrow"" is the kind of movie that might have scared me when I was 6 years old and uneducated. Now I can't help but laugh at the absurdity of it all. But hey, if you like movies with overwrought dialogue, a lame attempt at a love story, a severe lack of tension, no emotional pull (other than laughter), less believability than ""Independence Day,"" and one of the most anticlimactic endings I've ever seen in a Summer blockbuster, then this is the movie for you.Now if y'all will excuse me, I'm gonna head to the bathroom and take a Day After Tomorrow.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Roland Emmerich gives us a ludicrous take on Global Warming using familiar disaster movie tropes which depending on your mindset will meet your demands.,"NOAA paleoclimatologist, Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid), is researching the trapping of greenhouse gas in the Larsen Ice Shelf in Antarctica when the shelf begins to break off. At an intergovernmental conference on Global Warming in New Dehli, Hall presents his findings and warns of potential catastrophic climate shifts, but is met with skepticism from prominent political leaders especially Vice President of the United States, Raymond Becker (Kenneth Welsh), whose concerns lie more with the economy. Meanwhile Jack's estranged son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) travels to Manhattan for an academic decathlon along with his friends Laura (Emmy Rossum) and Brian (Arjay Smith) only to wind up stranded as the Climate Shift happens faster than Jack predicted leading to the trio becoming trapped in New York by flooding and rapidly dropping temperatures. As superstorms begin around the globe, the government must figure out how to evacuate their citizens while Jack travels to Manhattan to rescue his son.Released in the Summer of 2004, The Day After Tomorrow was something of a comeback for director Roland Emmerich after the mediocre, but financially successful, results of Godzilla and the critically ""better than average"" reviews for The Patriot but with more ""cooled"" box office not even appearing in the top 10 for that year. Opening at Number 2 behind Box Office Juggernaut Shrek 2 with $85 million over the memorial day weekend and earning $544 million worldwide, The Day After Tomorrow gained the distinction of being the highest grossing film to not open #1 at the U. S. Box Office util Inside Out in 2015. Inspired by Whitley Strieber's book, The Coming Global Superstorm, the movie's special effects were very extensive for the time featuring 416 visual effects shots with nine VFX houses and 1,000 effects artists to bring them to life. The movie received mixed reviews from critics and was derided by both climate scientists for its inaccuracy as well as climate deniers (many funded by fossil fuel companies) for pushing a ""myth"" (which it isn't), but regardless of where you fall on the spectrum The Day After Tomorrow is simply the well intentioned, but ludicrous and crazy, efforts of this generation's Irwin Allen equivalent.As with the disaster film's of 70s the movie is an ecercise in all the cliches and tropes we've seen in the ""disaster epic"" since Airport in 1970. Like William Holden's skyscraper builder in The Towering Inferno or Murray Hamilton's greedy corrupt mayor from Jaws, Kenneth Welsh as U. S. Vice President Raymond Becker (who bears a more than passing resemblance to Dick Cheney) is yet another in a long line of loud mouthed idiots driven by hubris and willful ignorance only to be forced to eat crow when they're inaction leads to the money shots of the movie. And of course to counterbalance the movie we have our protagonist Jack Hall played by Dennis Quaid who's basically to Kenneth Walsh what Paul Newman and Roy Scheider were to Holden and Hamilton, our rugged action hero who, like Cassandra, knew the dangers but was ignored, but unlike Cassandra was able to do something about it (to an extent anyway). Needless to say like those cheesy Irwin Allen epics the science is beyond inaccurate basically taking the points of Global Warming and boiling them down to the most simplistic point possible and putting those points on fast forward to justify the carnage and destruction that sells great in the international market. One standout sequence is definitely in the climax where our characters have to outrun a temperature drop (which makes for a pretty silly albeit enjoyable visual). For the time the effects still look pretty decent, even if I'm more nostalgic for earlier disaster films or contemporary smaller scale disaster films that utilize practical effects and models with more limited CGI.The Day After Tomorrow is pure formula from a director who's known for high budget low substance excess. If you're not on board with Roland Emmerich's ""master of disaster"" nonsense then this won't be the film to change your mind on that point. If however you're looking for a well-paced disaster flick that gives you solid leads and impressive visuals, here it is.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of the better apocalyptic features out there!,"The visual effects are stunning. For a film that will soon celebrate its twentieth anniversary they don't feel dated at all, which is surprising. Yet that was kind of obvious given that it was coming from none other than Mr. Emmerich.In addition to the aforementioned technical mastery, the storytelling has been outstanding. The way this gloomy, apocalyptic theme has been treated and presented to us is gripping to say the very least.Notwithstanding the fact that the script here outright refuses to expound or speak longer on the central issue of climate change, choosing instead to focus on this father-son dynamic, which in my frank opinion prevents the story from truly blossoming.Other than that, it's a powerful illustration of all the conceivable risks and challenges associated with such apocalyptic tragedies, and that is truly alarming.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Overcritizited,"I am aware of some critizing opinions about this movie. I realize a lot of scientistic facts are disorted even I am not the climate specialist.

Fun fact for me is that Jake Gyllenhall (I have no idea how to spell his surname haha) played 17 years old teeneger white he had 24 white shoooting. Even of this fact, cast was reliable for me and I kept my fingers crossed for the future face of the characters. I have no doubts special effects was really good. I know some green screen was too obvious for our eyes, but it did not disturb me from watching.

The end is nigh,"The Day After Tomorrow, released in 2004 and starring Dennis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhaal is a natural disaster apocalypse film from the director of Independence Day; Roland Emmerich.This CGI packed action adventure gives the audience everything they could hope for and much more. The lead roles played by Quaid and Gyllenhaal are superbly acted, especially when Quaid's character must choose to trek through the fast approaching ice age to save his son (Gyllenhaal) at any cost.The story is immaculately written and portrayed on screen, delivering a message that will stick with you long after watching this film.When given the choice between more recent apocalyptic film 2012 and The Day After Tomorrow, I would pick the latter every single time. They are both excellent films, but The Day After Tomorrow brings a sense of realism and believability with both it's scenario and story line. I came away from watching The Day After Tomorrow actually scared that something of a similar nature could very well happen.This isn't just another ""Inconvenient Truth"" styled documentary film, but a fictional story based on events that could possibly happen.The Day After Tomorrow is a film definitely worth watching!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Smoke and mirrors, all flash and no substance","THE DAY AFTER TOMORROWAspect ratio: 2.39:1Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTSUtterly routine blockbuster, loosely based on scientific predictions of disastrous climate changes due to global warming, in which the Gulf Stream is essentially 'shut off', triggering a series of freak weather conditions (giant hailstones in Japan, tornadoes in Los Angeles, tidal waves in New York, etc.) which culminate in a new Ice Age. Dennis Quaid is the obsessive climatologist who struggles to convince sceptical authorities of the impending catastrophe, and who is forced to rescue his son (Jake Gyllenhaal) after the boy becomes stranded in Manhattan following torrential floods and the subsequent Big Freeze. Industrial Light & Magic unleashes a wealth of attention-grabbing visual effects during the film's impressive opening stretch, effectively sidelining the crudely drawn characters and half-baked melodramatics, but the superficial script (by Jeffrey Nachmanoff and director Roland Emmerich) fails to sustain the initial momentum, and the second half becomes bogged down in Quaid's ho-hum rescue mission.To be fair, the movie DOES contain a number of awe-inspiring sequences (the massive wave which rises from the ocean to engulf New York; the view from space as three colossal storms circle the entire northern hemisphere of the earth; a trawler floating serenely down a flooded Fifth Avenue), and a couple of satirical jabs are surprisingly potent (most notably, the mass exodus of American citizens INTO Mexico!), but the movie amounts to little more than smoke and mirrors, all flash and no substance.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A classic of our time,"I watched this movie numerous times. 11 years ago or today, I still consider it a breathtaking masterpiece which devours you by the abyss of thoughts.This movie is a great call to action built on tense and terrific atmosphere of a man facing the nature. There's not a lot of truly good movies about natural disasters and so, but ""The Day After Tomorrow"" is definitely one of them.Every time I watch this movie I have the same jitters, same fear of what we could do to nature and what the nature could do to us. Same feelings for 11 years! I've changed my mind about countless movies since then, but not about this one - this one has risen in my eyes even more.The script is great, nice dialogues, acting is top-noch too. The movie was over-exaggerated? Well, who cares? We're always exaggerating things. Mainly to make them look more epic and just be more. And, of course, to make them more MEMORABLE, to leave an impression on you. Guess why? To break down the wall between the movie and the viewer, so then the viewer would return to his own reality and actually THINK about the problems that were brought up to them.

The United States of Mexico,"It was refreshing to see how Americans were denied entry into Mexico because of the sheer numbers of refugees trying to enter the country legally, or otherwise. The fact that Mexico closed their borders so Americans couldn't get there was quite sobering, when actually, it's just the opposite. The fact that our government went there to try to normalize the things up north and that our neighbors to the south opened their arms and their country to make us get back on our feet is something that Hollywood, or for that matter, the powers that be, will never think of contemplating.As far as ""The Day After Tomorrow"", directed by Ronald Emmerich, it presents a situation that calls for preventive measures from our country and all industrialized nations in order to avoid the apocalypse the film presents. The idea of a storm, so huge as this one, serves as a warning to prevent it at all costs.Mr. Emmerich has given us a film that is entertaining and poses a lot of questions about the way we humans do things here on earth. Dennis Quaid, is good portraying the desperate father that risks his own life trying to look for his son, trapped in New York's public library. Jake Gyllenhaal, doesn't have his usual intensity in the role of the son. Emmy Rossum, Ian Holm, Tamlyn Tomita, Sela Ward, and the others in the cast do whatever they can to convey the dire conditions they have to battle.""The Day After Tomorrow"" is film that is a warning of what we are doing to the environment and the possible consequences.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Crappy plot, hokey dialogue; great special effects (which is really all I expected)...","""The Day After Tomorrow"" has been promoted as a potentially true story. Filmmaker Roland Emmerich has tried to attract huge box office returns by claiming that scientists have predicted something similar to the events depicted in this film really could happen. I very much doubt it.The film's theory is rather thin, which may explain why it is simultaneously confusing. A scientist (played by Dennis Quaid) foresees a global disaster involving polar ice caps. His theory is that the earth's natural cycle of heat will be disrupted, resulting in the ""next ice age."" Of course, as New York City and Los Angeles are destroyed, and the United Kingdom is frozen solid, it is considered that mankind is being destroyed. Really? What about areas south of the US, such as Africa, Australia, and New Zealand?Emmerich doesn't deal with any other countries than the US and UK, which will serve as fuel for those who claim the United States is ignorant when it comes to other countries. But regardless, we are supposed to believe that the next ice age is occurring. Temperatures drop at rapid paces. Tidal waves roar across cities, destroying everything and everyone in their path. Tornadoes demolish large buildings and blow debris into cars and humans as they grow larger. While this happens, Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) is trapped in Manhattan's public library. His father (Quaid) tells him to stay put, and that he'll come get him. There are some fine action sequences prior to the rescue, such as when Sam finds himself trapped in a large vessel with a pack of wolves that have escaped from a zoo (don't ask). Great special effects and tense sequences are ultimately what make silly scenes like this so fun.Emmerich is notorious for his big-budget disaster flicks such as the colossal ""Independence Day"" and equally gargantuan ""Godzilla."" Neither of those two movies worked for me. ""Independence Day"" was rather stupid and ""Godzilla"" was both stupid and inept; a totally joyless B-monster movie homage complete with a multi-million dollar budget and famous stars. If ""Godzilla"" was an homage to those cheesy cult monster flicks, then ""The Day After Tomorrow"" is Emmerich's ode to the disaster flicks of the 1950s and '60s, when the Cold War had just begun to settle, and when novels such as ""Alas, Babylon"" depicted vivid images of a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Indeed, ""Day"" contains all the fundamental elements of a B-movie, but happens to boast one of the largest budgets in cinema history as a counter to this summary.Emmerich's best film, so far, has been the one in which he abandoned disastrous activities for a touching story in ""The Patriot,"" which starred Mel Gibson, and which I highly recommend despite its historical inaccuracies. However, ""The Day After Tomorrow"" also comes with a recommendation (albeit a half-hearted one) because it has one vital ingredient that Emmerich's other disaster movies sorely lacked: A sense of fun and bouncy spirit.Yes, ""The Day After Tomorrow,"" while admittedly stupid, is also a very fun movie with some of -- if not the -- best CGI sequences I have ever seen. Many people might argue that the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy boasted superior visual effects, but I beg to differ. Here, we see New York City demolished before our very eyes. Tidal waves pour across Manhattan -- most of them seemed so real that even my very cynical perception failed to trace them.""Day"" represents a breakthrough in computer generated images -- I had a hard time spotting quite a number of them in this film. I am usually rather anti-CGI. I consider it to be a generally sloppy way of film-making for directors too lazy to put effort into making more realistic stunt sequences for their films. But here, one of the only reasons I can recommend the movie in the first place is because of its CGI. The New York City sequence (roughly ten minutes long) is worth the admission price alone.The acting is fairly impressive. Quaid does his best with the dialogue he is given. Gyllenhaal (who frequently demanded dialogue re-writes on the set of the film) makes his character likable and a relatable hero. The movie is not great by any means but the performances are far better than those in ""Independence Day.""On the downside, Emmerich's film is so blatantly liberal that it almost ruins some of the fun. The President of the United States bears an uncanny resemblance to Al Gore. He is depicted as the ""good guy."" When he dies, the Vice President takes over. He is the ""bad guy"" who ignores the warnings of scientists and is responsible for the deaths of millions. Towards the end of the film (without ruining all of it) he apologizes to America for being ignorant and declares that we have been stealing from Mother Earth too long, and should have been more careful with our resources, yadda yadda. I feel like I've seen this movie before. And I feel like I've seen this same sort of speech before. Could it be from ""Independence Day""? Maybe. Either way, ""The Day After Tomorrow"" has some of the best special effects I've ever seen. And that is really all I expected from this movie, and I was surprised to find a fair amount of humor, fun, and tense scenes that I really didn't expect at all. I think Emmerich is finally learning how to make a good disaster movie -- hopefully his next will be as good as this.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A really good disaster film and worth the watch!,"Now before you judge me for my 8/10 rating you gotta understand that you can't judge this film for its wacky science and all. It's a disaster film and none of them ever abide by science or the laws of physics and all. It's story and characters are pretty good and straightforward and the acting. Dennis Quaid is a good lead, Jake Gyllenhaal is alright, Emily Rossum is good, Ian Holm is always great to see etc. The story is straightforward and I won't spoil that but it flows well and makes sense mostly but I'll get to that in a bit. The effects are very good and still hold up almost 20 years later! That alone makes it worth a watch.The only downsides to the film that I don't like are that 1) they cut out some good deleted scenes that would help build up things more and show more chaos around the world. And beyond what they cut I wish there was more to see how the whole world was effected. 2) the first half of the film is very strong. The build up and the unfolding disaster and how things get worse and how everyone reacts and the phony science babble, I love it! But the second half is a tad underwhelming in comparison and turns into a rescue film. It's not bad but it weighs the film down and I wish it was more about the various disasters and climate change instead of all that time spent on the rescue.Overall a fantastic disaster film and one enjoy watching on a rainy spring or summer day.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A bit half-baked, but I liked it","End of the world movies these days seem to be dime-a-dozen, like Die Hard-esquire action flicks were years ago, and like PG-13 horror remakes sadly seem to be these days. This is another one of them, a prolific, epic film that tries as hard as it can to be intelligent and gripping. It wants to impress you with knowledge, special effects, and a very moving, risky, adventurous plot. But is it worth all that if your plot turns out half baked and unfinished? That's the deal with The Day After Tomorrow---there are the pieces of a really great thriller/action/post-apocalyptic film here, but nobody bothered to put them together.For instance, a plot involving our main character's wife and a young disabled boy whom she treats in the hospital where she works. This would've likely been a pretty good plot element, and it was touching from what little we saw, but nobody bothered to expand on it and make it an actual part of the story. It was just a tidbit on the side, barely even an element of the plot at all. The romance elements as well were there, just not expanded upon enough. In fact, most of the characters in general weren't as fleshed out as they could've been. Expanding upon their rather shallow exteriors could've made for a world-class movie, but alas that was not to be. The ending as well, felt very hollow, like they just had to end it to meet a deadline. It wasn't a bad ending, but it could've been so much more. And thus, we're left with a movie that feels like they didn't work as hard as they could've. This is a movie that tried to fit in elements from adventure films, a bit of romance, and of course some current world issues into one film, which apparently was too short to house all of it. All of these things just crush the film with their weight. Expanding the running length with a more fleshed out plot and characters would've benefited this, but it's entertaining nonetheless.It's not without it's merits, though, for this is still worthy of an 8/10. This is a movie with big money behind it, and of course all of the visuals are stunning, beautiful, yet absolutely devastating and terrible, chaotic. All of the special effects here were orchestrated perfectly, and thus this is a film best viewed on a large screen with surround-sound speakers. Tidal waves, tornadoes, snowstorms, and more, all in their whole, destructive forms. That's the best thing about this one, I'd say, the special effects. Too bad they sacrificed plot elements for it.

And as it seems, Mr. Emmerich seems to like the Disaster idea, as his new movie choice shows -> 2012!

The controversy over this movie is utterly stupid,"First of all, here's a clue: IT'S A BLOCKBUSTER, BIG-BUDGET Hollywood MOVIE!!! The guy who directed this did the same for Independence Day, for crying out loud, and while that was a great movie, it wasn't exactly great because of its riveting, realistic plot. I actually read the book based on this film, and considered it to be a nice roller coaster ride, and little more, though it did cause me to think a little bit. That being said, here are a few salient points that need to be considered:Regardless of your belief/disbelief in the theory of global warming, there are other reasons to look for alternative fuels:1) There are finite reserves of oil in the world. Eventually, it's gonna run out.2) Most of the OPEC nations treat their people worse than many of us treat stray animals, and their people don't like us.3) By being dependent on oil, we face the problem and risk of being too dependent on a few other nations, and what happens if they shut off the oil?Look in your history books. It was called the OPEC embargo, and it caused both rampant inflation and massive job losses.4) Burning fossil fuels aren't exactly going to make the air more breathable. If you don't believe me, go to LA on a bad smog day.If the environmental lobby would focus on these points instead of esoteric scientific data that the average person neither knows about nor could understand, they'd be a lot more successful. But regardless of all of this, it's a movie. It's entertainment. If you like it, fine. If you don't, fine. Everyone has different tastes in everything, and that's one of the things that keep are society interesting. Just don't give me your inane, boring prattle about how this supports or contradicts your world view, because that's really not at all what this movie is about. As for me, I'll grab the gallon bucket of popcorn and a nice, large soda, sit back, and enjoy the show, and advise those of you interested in seeing the movie to do the same.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Sometime next week,"Roland Emmerich may have scored huge with ID4, but the film was crippled by gung-ho flag-waving and a reluctance to explore the dark nature of the story. I think that Emmerich is a far better director than writer, but even though he once more pens the screenplay here he wisely opts to make it a much more serious film. Where he once destroyed the Big Apple and the Big Orange with fire, now he does it with water, but no one's laughing. And Will Smith isn't in it.Dennis Quaid (brother of ID4's hero) stars as a climatologist who predicts that a new ice age will freeze Planet Earth within the next few hundred years. An enormous chunk of the Larsen Ice Shelf in Antarctica breaks off and melts into the Atlantic, shutting down the gulf stream. Hurricanes form all over the world, with twisters and storms ripping though major cities. A flood submerges New York, trapping Jake Gyllenhaal and his classmates in the New York Public library. With nowhere to go they wait it out as dad Quaid promises to rescue them.There's no winning this time round. Everyone is a loser as the world goes into a deep freeze, covering most of America and Europe in a hundred feet of snow. But this film is about the journey, and the destination, not the end result. There are some clichés and a little bit of humor, but they're all subdued and do not annoy as much as they did in ID4. The only disappointment is Harald Kloser's bland, uninteresting score with is a far cry from the sorrowful, romantic themes from Armageddon by Trevor Rabin, an approach which really could have worked here.While it ain't no masterpiece, it's one of Emmerich's better movies and, despite the exaggerated portrayal of climate change, will last for the ages, unlike it's alien invasion older brother.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Oh! The Weather Outside Is Frightful...,"I really enjoyed this film by director Roland Emmerich a great deal. It is a fast-paced, exciting, suspenseful film filled with wonderful images, great CGI effects, plausible acting, and even a coherent script. How realistic is it? I hope not at all, but the director made the film so that it seems very real and like something that MIGHT happen. The story revolves around some major climatic shifts that cause the entire Northern hemisphere to become Artic tundra. New York City is devastated as are other major cities all over Europe. Dennis Quaid gives a good performance as a climatologist that predicted some of these events. We see things through his perspective and that of his son for much of the movie. The acting in general is good in this film. I particularly liked Ian Holm's role as the British meteorologist stuck in the middle of nowhere while these changes advanced. Much of the credit for the film's success must go to Emmerich. This is easily one of his best films. He keeps his viewer on the edge of his/her seat through the entire film. Action is the film's primary objective, but Emmerich also uses a lot of humanity in what his character's motivations are, and I for one, enjoyed seeing that side of humanity rather than what I probably would see under similar circumstances. As a previous viewer noted, this is a great popcorn movie!",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Day after the Lie,"The Day after the LieReview by Mr.TThe Day after Tomorrow is a Science-Fiction movie about the effect of global warming within an IceAge and some other extreme weather conditions. Besides there are a little group of young people arrested in a library and fighting for there lives. One Group member is the Son from Jack Hall the discoverer of the big disaster and Jack started a rescue mission.The movie was directed by Roland Emmerich and released worldwide in 2004.I will review four aspects: -At first the plot -Secondly the actors -Thirdly the camera movement -Fourth the musicThe Plot is shaped by Roland Emmerichs Style for example he love the big Show far away from the reality and mixed with some emotion. The dubious Story of the Movie could never happen like this and with this fact in your mind you can detect a lot of unrealistic points. For example there is only one Person (Jack Hall) who can warn the world , the world falls in a new IceAge within a month and the whole East coast of America got hit by a giant tide. These three points are only some of a lot. Nevertheless the Story is unpretentious and I got this feeling because the scenes are predictable but its a interesting presentation of an oversubscribed disaster imagination.The actors are boring and low they can not transport the action and drama from the special effects around them out of the Screen. Because of that i got the feeling that this is ""Acting"" like a Job they have to do without passion.The camera is filming on a high level there are a lot of beautiful scenes created by the best Virtual Artists in the world. The pictures are more addicting my emotions than every acting from the actors. I have nothing to crisis on the camera.The Same with the Music its such a good orchestra and created an important scenery in the background. The Music have a more important role than the actors in the Movie because I can watch the movie in a unfamiliar Language an got the interesting feeling of the Music which is pointed in the scenes very good.All in All the Movie is good for action and Roland Emmerich fans but as expected The story is flat and predictable as well as unrealistic.5 of 10 Points(School Project by JT)",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Stood the test of time,"The main argument for those who do not like this movie is that its not scientifically accurate. Is Nolan's Interstellar scientifically accurate? Is Kubrick's 2001 accurate? Even the most accurate Sci-fi, Contact, is not that accurate.This is not a documentary, but even if it was, some people still do not ""believe"" in climate change, others don't believe humans are causing it. Scientists have been saying this since the 70s, but false ""belief"" is the cancer of human civilisation. So, this movie was trying to exaggerate the impact of climate change in the hope this idea can eventually penetrate some thick skulls.Surprise, surprise, a good portion of what is in this movie (the sever hurricanes, flooding and winter vortex) has been happening in the past 15 years since its release, albeit a lot slower. Who knows, maybe the rest will occur in the future.I go back to watch this movie every few months. There are scenes that feel just nice, like that fire in the library or the camping in the frozen kitchen, and for the most part it is quite entertaining. I admit there is some redundant storylines like that ill boy, but hey, nothing is perfect.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Take It For What It Is,"The Day After Tomorrow is a global warming Earth disaster movie. A it does pretty much what it set out to do: have a lot of big special effects scenes, have a basic plot, and some dialogue that will advance the film from scene to scene.Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) is a paleoclimatologist who warns world leaders about the dangers of global warming. He is laughed off by many, but Jack believes that it will be the next generation that pays for it never his own. However, sooner than he predicted extreme weather events pop up all over the world and the another ice age looms.The film then takes the turn of Hall going to save his son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) who gets stuck in New York with Laura Chapman (Emmy Rossum) on a school trip.This is pretty much the movie in a nut shell. And this doesn't ruin it because when you go into it you get exactly what you're expecting. It succeeds for most part on the big special effects scenes, it succeeds in having a basic plot that does enough to keep you watching, and it succeeds in having dialogue that you can tolerate that will bring you to the next scene without cringing, for the most part.The Day After Tomorrow isn't going after Oscar Nominations, it's just there to give you an entertaining watch. If you decide to turn on this movie take it for what it is, a popcorn flick.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Great disaster film that's stood the test of time,"This movie has stood the test of time, and in my opinion, is one of the best disaster movies out there. With climate change swooping down on us, some of these scenes feel too close to home and make for compelling viewing.The visual effects are still mesmerizing, especially in the hurricane and tsunami scenes. I've seen a lot of comments about the plot, and the 2nd half being dull, but no matter how many times I've seen this I still find myself at the edge of my seat with enough action to keep me hooked.Dennis Quaid is the star of this; he's so convincing as the distracted father, trying to repair the relationship with his son. His mission to rescue him is truly rewarding.Side note; I LOVE the sound effects during the 'eye of the storm' scene. Just amazing.Enjoy the ride and don't take this too seriously. It is still miles better than recent CGI-obsessed disaster movies, but also a vast improvement on the old 90s cheese.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of My Childhood Favorite Movie,"I remember watching this movie when I was young and really like it. Now I still enjoyed watching this movie. I do like how it's about a series of disaster that happen in current places and it leading up to a new ice age. The actual story is the weakest part of the movie because it's a bunch of plotlines combine all together. This include a group of friends trying to survival the disaster, the father mission to go save his son, and other plotlines that ended pretty quickly. The movie feels unfocused with a bunch of things that happen in the movie and doesn't have development towards the characters. And there's a couple of illogical moments in the movie, But the highlight of the movie are the disaster scenes. The movie have great special effects on how they made the disaster scenes and still holds up really well. It's also makes the scenes really suspenseful and terrifying to be in the same situation as the characters in the movie. I really like how the characters do their best to survive against the disaster and are pretty smart. The movie contains different types of disaster like hail, tornado, tsunami, and blizzard that cause things to freeze.As for the acting, I found the acting to be pretty good and the actors did a good job.Overall I still really like this movie a lot.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
68 Weeks,"Godzilla has long been interpreted as a metaphor for the atomic bomb. 'The Day Before Tomorrow' atones for the exploitation of destruction for its own that characterises the disaster movie by addressing the 'unsexy' subject of the consequences of global warming (although Fox has the cheek to inset plugs for Fox News and Sky TV).The demon king is personified by Kenneth Welsh as a Vice President who bears a suspicious resemblance to his real life template (although you'd never have caught Dick Cheney admitting he'd ever been wrong, as he eventually does here); the film's makers plainly couldn't stomach an accurate representation of George W. Bush.The film took a lot of flack for the speed with which calamity struck (it's barely been on for a minute before a polar expedition is disrupted by cracks in the ice, soon followed by the money shot of the Statue of Liberty hit by a tidal wave), but has sadly been vindicated by the horror stories you find in practically every paper you've read in the twenty years since it originally hit the screens.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It was (mostly) not that bad!,"I always like Jake Gyllenhaal in every movie that he is in and I must say that this movie felt like it was ahead of its time and I couldn't believe that it was made 18 years ago when I watched it. I don't know if it was the camera, the acting, or what. It must've been the first world-weather-disaster-apocalyptic movie of its type and there were certain parts that I found to be pretty entertaining! Some things were a bit over the top though and life-saving events in the movie constantly happened just in the nick of time which got to be tiresome, and I felt like they were a bit too unbelievable to be occurring (even more than the storms and rapidly cooling temperatures!). Other than that, I'd say that anyone who enjoys this genre will have a pretty good time!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The day before yesterday I thought I wanted to see this,"It's all been said. This movie was as big a letdown, if not bigger than the Matrix sequels. This movie was an insult to the intelligence of anyone with an education beyond 8th grade. Nice to see the minorities represented. Hispanic janitor, intelligent Asian woman, homeless African American. Not to mention the stereotypical librarian. Jake Gyllenhaal was awesome in Donnie Darko so I figured if he was in this that it had to be at least decent. Sneaky bastard Jake! I don't know how he managed to do decent acting using the horrible script and the vomit inducing acting that took place all around him. Kudos to Jake for managing to keep his head above water in this one, despite the constant dragging of everyone around him. He obviously couldn't carry the movie but he made a valiant effort it would seem. I'm ashamed of how naive I was to think that this thing wasn't going to be as cheesy and corny as it was. I've seen few movies this chocked full of both. Even if you take it at a base level and look at this totally for the brainless entertainment factor, again, unless you're an ignorant moron, your intelligence is going to be offended. The action sequences, people managing to run several yards, up flights of stairs from a 14 story wall of water had me squirming to run out of the theater, in hopes that I might salvage the rest of my evening. Need I mention the emotional insult? Next to no character development, half assed at best. Unless you're extremely shallow, you're going to gag on the convenient store, prepackaged, freeze dried, preservative filled, single serving emotional scenes.

"Today, Tomorrow, Who cares?","OK... first off, let me say that I am a devout disaster movie fan. I have a number of disaster DVD's in my collection which range from subtle messages (The China Syndrome) to the slam, whish BANG (Towering Inferno). So, usually going into a disaster movie, I know not to expect too much because the genre, at many times seems to kill itself by it's subject matter. Case in point, The Day After Tomorrow.When I saw the previews, I knew I had to see it. So, I went out on it's first day of release and saw it and I have to say that I was totally dissapointed in this movie. I concluded that Mr. Emmerich has either watched too many or not enough disaster movies in his time. The movie was filled with evey cliche' (I need to find my son, whom I need to spend more time with, NOW that I'm faced with the fact that he may be dead), every stupid villian (the MEAN vice president), the token special effects that override every other thing in the movie (twisters in LA!), and most of all , the citizens of the United States, being cast as the dumbest, spoiled, inconsiderate people on the face of this earth. (Because obviously, the president knows everything.)Anyway, let me sum it up, as someone else has commented, this film could have been so much more... I would have felt great about the movie if I could have walked out of it feeling scared as hell that this could actually happen. I would have felt good if the destruction of the world (because we all live in New York and LA) could have been spread out in more than the first 30 minutes of the movie, and I would have felt OK if everyone in this movie wasn't so gosh darn stupid (because obviously, if  a twister touched down in our backyards, we would try and videotape it from 30 feet away while our house is being torn down.)I'll probably buy the DVD when it comes out at christmas time and when I hear Dennis Quaid in the behind the scenes documentary on the disc (AND IT BETTER HAVE ONE) say ""Roland really knew how to write a smart, thrilling disaster movie"" or.. ""this film really shows what could happen with the way that we are destroying our world"" I will laugh out loud, while riding down the street in my H2 and in the same sentence complain about how much I'm paying to keep it filled up, because it's my duty as an American!.......

"Great visuals, and that's it.","If one were going to choose the poster child of disaster movie clichés, they would need to look no further than The Day After Tomorrow. This film is almost the culmination of every disaster movie set before it. There's the protagonist, a scientist (Dennis Quaid) who is always right, the ignorant politician who is always wrong, the obnoxious media reporters (one of which who has an almost comical death involving a billboard), and the supporting members of the protagonist's group, one of which will surely die. Finally, there is the estranged family member who the protagonist will inevitably make up with in the end. Overshadowing all of this is the antagonist disaster, in this case being a runaway climate that manages to go completely out of control in about a week's time.The special effects of The Day After Tomorrow are incredibly well done. The global storms that terrorize the Northern Hemisphere throughout the movie look and feel massive providing a sense of horrified awe whenever you see them. Unfortunately, the visuals cannot make up for the unoriginal dialog and characters. Do not watch it expecting to be blown away by the acting, but if you are looking for something exciting to kill an hour and a half on a week night, this is the movie for you.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A thrilling dive into climate catastrophe,"""The Day After Tomorrow"" is a gripping disaster film that explores the catastrophic effects of global climate change. Directed by Roland Emmerich, the movie follows climatologist Jack Hall, played by Dennis Quaid, as he races against time to save his son Sam, portrayed by Jake Gyllenhaal, and the world from an unprecedented superstorm.The film excels in its visual effects, creating breathtaking and terrifying scenes of natural disasters, from massive tornadoes to colossal tidal waves and sudden ice ages. These sequences are not only visually stunning but also serve as a stark reminder of the potential consequences of ignoring climate change.The narrative is engaging, balancing personal stories of survival and familial bonds with the larger-scale environmental crisis. Quaid and Gyllenhaal deliver compelling performances, adding emotional depth to the high-stakes action.While ""The Day After Tomorrow"" offers thrilling entertainment and a poignant message, it occasionally falls into the trap of scientific exaggeration and clichéd dialogue.

"Despite Science, Disaster Movie Has A Lot of Heart","30 May 2004. Spectacular effects along with good characters and smart script regardless of the science. Finally, a movie comes along that has the excitement and thrills of disaster of disasters along with a strong characters and a good relational development that is usually lacking in most disaster movies. Usually the stereotypical Airport or Earthquake movie is mostly bypassed in this movie except for the poor and downtrodden and a dog. But people die...sometimes unexpectedly...but realistically and poignantly.The fusion of a good story along with a fantastic backdrop makes for a definitely superior kind of movie.

There is a spattering of humor in the right places to ease the tension, but unlike most movies it is done with tact and is never over the top - mostly real, informal humor.

"Ridiculous Story, But Fun To Watch","I was leery of a heavy propaganda piece on ""global warming,"" but I still saw this and found that, yeah that's what it was but it was really more of just a straight adventure story than anything else.....and not a bad one, at that. The first 50 minutes of this two-hour film have the ""fun parts"" where the special-effects dominate. We see all kinds of radical weather disasters that are extremely dramatic and entertaining to watch, even if they don't make a bit of sense.After the blizzard and sub-zero, unlivable weather conditions arrive the movie settles down to a young romance and survival story with Jake Gyllenhaal, Emily Rossum and other people trapped in a library in New York City and Jake's father, played by Dennis Quaid, walking all the way from Philadelphia to rescue him. Yes, it's very, very far-fetched - the whole thing - but it's a fun adventure story with nice people. It's especially refreshing to see Hollywood portray a father as being so loving and selfless. The romance wasn't overdone and the young people were not profane and/or annoying, as so often is the case.Except for the over-exaggerated and extremely erroneous scare tactics of this movie, and a ridiculous portrayal of the Vice Preseint of the United States, the movie works strictly as an entertaining fantasy-adventure story.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Nature is no respecter of feelings...,"... or for that matter, relationships; nor it seems, logic! This isn't meant to be as harsh a criticism as it possibly sounds. The shortcomings in logic are most easily dismissed - the movie was meant to be nothing more than an impressive CGI spectacle, so the fact that resorting to the 'fantastical' is sometimes too easy for the makers to resist should come as no surprise. Ordinarily though, I'd find myself a little peeved when a movie also prefers to skimp on the verisimilitude of emotional drama. Strangely enough, however, this time that didn't harm my goodwill toward TDAT.With such a shortened timescale as the film (again) erroneously presents, emotions may well be condensed and virtual strangers could easily find themselves compelled to behave as if they'd known each other their whole lives - in the context of events, these four days ARE their entire lives!My only real complaints were that I felt the relationship between father and son wasn't really established well enough for it to later become the emotional fulcrum of the picture. This isn't a slight upon the performances of Quaid and Gyllenhaal, for they are fine - but if it's decided that mere human oiks are going to be secondary to dwelling on destruction wreaked by the elements, then don't try to manipulate our sympathies for them by the end of the disaster! Similarly, the characters alternately get a little corny/triumphalist at the denouement; something I found hard to stomach given that footage which stems from mankind's ignorance is lingered over lovingly by Emmerich regardless. Still, who expected Hollywood to have a sound ecological conscience? Not me, and despite the contradictions between ""this could really happen!"" versus severe artistic license to make it more entertaining, this still remains a decent enough time.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

When The States Freeze Over,"This is perhaps one of the most unintentionally funny, illogical, ridiculous, pretentious and trashiest piece of crap to emerge as a Hollywood blockbuster. 'The Day After Tomorrow' pretends to be the ultimate disaster movie but instead ends up being one of the ultimate disastrous movies. Roland Emmerich seems to have stolen an elementary schoolkid's story that he had to present as homework. The plot and characters are terribly clichéd. His direction is pretty amateurish and obviously people would go and watch it for the special effects (which aren't so bad). Of course there are some hilarious sequences, such as the state forgiving Mexico's debt in exchange that they allow American refugees to seek refuge. Poor Europe (America's current rival) is already under ice and Asia (America's current 'enemy') and Africa (whom America does not give a damn about) too experiences the same fate. The performances are equally bad. Dennis Quaid, Jake Gyllenhaal, Emmy Rossum and the rest of the cast act as though they are playing with little children. Sela Ward is the only one who gives a suitably restrained performance (as long as she's not crying on screen). Basically, this is just another one of those films that shows how America equals the world and it's all that matters and that needs saving. Forget the rest of the world. So okay, it's just a movie but it only entertained me at the cost of being a hypocritical piece of garbage.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A brave attempt, but it falters with the story and other basic film principals","The Day After Tomorrow is a rather entertaining film which combines good CGI and character development and mixes them up into a film containing elements of a rather delicate subject; namely global warming.Unfortunately, the CGI and character development is all that this film has going for it when it comes to the basic principals of good film-making. The whole 'moral message' about the global warming and stoppage of environment destroying is made very obvious, very early on. This is rammed into our faces with some very disorientating montage sequences, very early on in the film with various natural disasters occurring through out the world. From the beginning, we are immediately shown some of the flaws this film has. It moves from one thing to the next at a confused pacing and annoying things like this crop up at various intervals.The early montage scenes, as I've mentioned, are very sudden. There is no real build up to these scenes; it's just random hail in Japan amongst other things in other places. Here, a bit of character build up would have worked so that we can sympathise with the people going through hell thanks to the weather, but there isn't any so we don't really care that much and this detracts from the experience. Another thing is the editing, which is sloppy. I can understand shaky camera work in a moment of panic and chaos but only if it's from someone's point of view. In this scene, it's just blurred and too chaotic to even notice/care what the hell is happening. Some patience and some build up would have worked.Another thing is that the initial disaster of the tornados around L.A happens a little too early on for me. The film makers were probably a little eager to show off the CGI, but they had the chance to do that with the earlier scenes, of which they could have executed a little better. Here, it seems L.A. is eliminated and just brushed aside for the rest of the film in an odd message from the director consisting of: 'Right, here's the shock and awe of the weather in this film. Something as big as L.A. is gone so forget about it'. We don't find out what happens in the aftermath and in the end, the whole attack probably didn't even need to happen to advance the film; as I said - it was merely a show off.During the bulk of a film, especially a thriller like this one, you need some suspense or build up. In The Day After Tomorrow, there isn't any. One half of the characters in the film are attempting a rescue mission, the other half are staying in the same place for the entire film. That's not going to work. The only real fight the hero(s) have is the chase on the large boat against the wolves which floats into the city, in fact the wolves, in their brief appearance, are actually more of a match for the hero(s) and are more 'frightening' than the weather is.So, you get the idea that this film is rather slow in the middle and after a good beginning (bar the ridiculous early montages) it falters further and further before stumbling over the finish line with a bit of a silly ending. The character development is good but with the un-thrilling middle this film has, that's all the characters CAN do: talk. One good thing that this has through out is the CGI. Right from the beginning, the opening track shot of the ice glazier leaves you guessing whether or not it's actually real! and this momentum and consistent superior CGI is maintained through out, rivalling that of other releases of around this film's time that contain CGI, so at least it's good to end on a positive note.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The film presents all the desire to be politically correct and respect the moral values of societies. A strong message with great visual effects and lot of enterteining,"The Day After Tomorrow is pure entertainment. Final point, end of discussion. Anyone who decides to venture into this work by director Roland Emmerich should know exactly what to expect. This is not the place to look for big dramas, ecstatic performances, ingenious scripts, deep and intense meanings. What's on offer here is nothing more than stunning special effects, which in turn deliver high-impact scenes executed to perfection. And the best thing is that this film is not intended to be anything more than that.After utilizing aliens and a giant ""radioactive"" lizard to destroy New York and other American cities, Emmerich this time adopted man-made environmental changes as an excuse to create his usual apocalypse. The curious thing is that, according to several scientists, most of the phenomena seen throughout the film are plausible, although they could never occur in such a short period of time (but if we were willing to accept the possibility of Earth being attacked by aliens who use our satellites as timers, why wouldn't we accept this ""creative freedom"" of The Day After Tomorrow?). So, after following the explanations of the paleo climatologist played by Dennis Quaid, we are bombarded with a long and impressive sequence in which the filmmaker destroys Los Angeles with tornadoes that make those seen in Twister look like breezes - in addition, of course, to the special attention devoted to his favorite victim, New York, which is flooded, covered in snow and later frozen. And, of course, Emmerich recreates the famous shot in which we see a wave of destruction advancing through the corridor formed by the city's buildings (with the difference that, instead of fire, we have water).The Day After Tomorrow tells the story of Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid), a paleo climatologist dedicated to investigating the changes in our planet's climate over the millennia. He and his team stumble upon bewildering findings that do not impress their fellow scientists, with the exception of renowned professor Terry Rapson (Ian Holm). The two exchange information and come to a startling conclusion: in the next 100 years the Earth will go through a new ice age and its northern hemisphere will freeze, resulting in a series of catastrophes. Turns out Jack was wrong. The time scale should not be measured in centuries, but in hours! His attempts to alert the government, to save as many people as possible, come to nothing. As he sees his country being ravaged by hurricanes, tornadoes, snowstorms, earthquakes, tidal waves and whatever else angry mother nature has on her menu of doom, Jack must try to save his son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal), isolated with his friends. In a blasted and frozen New York.The plot shows the revolt of nature against the abuses and mistreatment that man has committed in recent decades. Global warming has caused an upheaval in the climate and our planet will enter a new Ice Age. It doesn't really matter how. It is important, yes, to see again how Emmerich treats the theme: a world hecatomb seen through the prism of some groups of characters united by family ties and/or love and friendship. Just like Independence Day. Dennis Quaid's character in this second film is practically the same as Jeff Goldblum's in the first. Remember the dog jumping out of the fire at the last moment in Independence Day? They did the same thing, with the good guy saving the girl from a giant wave, in the middle of New York. Bobeou, it's on the same street! There's even the President of the United States in the middle of the whole story. It is also classic the situation of the specialist in the subject that alerts the local authority (in this case, the vice president of the USA), that in turn ends up not taking the necessary measures, either by political whim or by incompetence. All disaster movies have it. Remember Shark? And the attack on the World Trade Center? Then...The film carefully builds on the tension that precedes the final blow: the shots that show thousands of birds soaring through the skies of New York are impressive, as is the one that shows the formation of a tornado. But the most interesting moments of the projection are those that show, in an ironic way, the desperation of the Americans stopped by the Mexican police as they try to cross the border towards the South. In fact, the script (written by Emmerich and Jeffrey Nachmanoff) deserves credit for its relevant criticism of the Bush administration's (lack of) environmental policy at the time of its launch in 2004, including the US president's decision to withdraw the country from the important Treaty of Kyoto.Unfortunately, The Day After Tomorrow becomes fragile when it changes its focus of attention, when it practically ignores the collective tragedy represented by the 'new Ice Age' and dedicates itself to the individual problems of its characters. Now, considering that billions of people have just frozen to death, who cares about Jake Gyllenhaal's crush on Emmy Rossum? And why should we be concerned about the foolish journey undertaken by Quaid, who decides to travel from Washington to New York to find his son (risking the lives of two more colleagues), even though he knows it won't make the slightest difference, since he'll never arrive in time to rescue him? (The trip becomes even more stupid when we discover that if he only waited two or three days, the guy could go by helicopter.)The viewer is told, for example, that a summit meeting to discuss global warming is dealt with randomly and superficially. That both an internationally famous meteorologist (Dennis Quaid) and the US vice president (Kenneth Welsh) discuss climate change on Earth as if they were on a regular television show. The extreme cold seems to have frozen all the characters' brains. Emmerich, who also writes the film, purports to depict a civilization of perfect idiots, or his conception of the characters is that they don't give them any form of shelter for intelligence. Jack, Sam, Laura, Jason and Lucy - the only ones who seem to have survived in New York - are trapped in the public library as if they were in the house of some reality show. The relationship between them is ridiculous and they are able to burn all the books in the place to keep warm, but not a chair, not a simple table leg.The succession of clichés and some of the heaviest nonsense ever heard about the consequences of global warming - which is the theme of the film - scares more than the arrival of a new ice age. Little pieces of humor sprinkled over the film - Americans trying to flee illegally to Mexico, the President of the Republic addressing the nation via the Weather Channel, the US forgiving Third World debt in recognition of shelter given to refugees - are just as subtle as the text of some humorous program.Most propaganda films bet on extreme arguments and exaggeration in order to convince viewers that their cause is just: just watch American and German productions of the genre during World War II to see this fact. And, with a little benevolence, we can classify The Day After Tomorrow as a propaganda film not exactly political, but environmentalist. And, in this case, its narrative fragility means little in the face of the good cause it represents. Besides, it's always fun to see (on movie screens) giant waves covering a metropolis, isn't it? For all those who like catastrophe cinema, The Day After Tomorrow is a full plate, as long as you don't run the risk of having indigestion with all this desire to be politically correct and respect the moral values of societies. A film with such a strong message deserved better than an American disaster film.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
'I think we are on the verge of a major climate shift!',"Though this film was made in 2004 and too few people realized the implications of Writer/Director Roland Emmerich's sci-fi fantasy as being in many ways a call to attention of the ignoring of the global climate due to our interference with the natural aspects of this planet, watching it again in 2013, with the backlashes of the hideous hurricanes and ice storms and the tsunamis and the drought and the hottest year on record being 2012, hopefully will provide a bit more serious look at the concept THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW offers. Yes, it is exaggerated for impact and the visual effects tend to take over the personal stories that lie so closely under the surface, but watch it and think. This is where we likely are headed - or something very like it.Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) is a Paleoclimatologist stationed in the Antarctica where he finds that a sheet of ice the size of Rhode Island has sheared off. 'Our climate is fragile. At the rate we're polluting the environment and burning fossil fuels, the ice caps will soon disappear.' Concurrently the planet is witnessing severe weather changes - and Jack's son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) is in New York with friend Laura (Emmy Rossum) and others when enduring an endless rainstorm they witness a massive tidal wave in addition to freezing cold temperatures that could possibly kill them. In the background is Sam's physician mother (Sela Ward) who brings a sense of personal agony to the realization that the world is heading for a next Ice Age. From there the story is a matter of Jack's swearing to save his son trapped in the Library in New York and warning the President (Perry Blake) to take his head out of the sand and realize that the extermination of the human race is possible if evacuations South are not begun. How it ends is predictable and makes the film too shallow, but the message is strong and one we must all heed.The special effects are extraordinarily fine and the cast delivers the sub-stories with skill. Yes, it can be viewed as corny and overblown and a bit on the sanguine side, but the point of the film is well worth our serious attention. Just reflect on the events of the past year and the few years before that and try to deny that we are indeed harming our environment and future.Grady Harp",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Overplayed, inaccurate and ridiculous - an instant hit","You know what you're getting with a film like The Day After Tomorrow: after Earth enters an instant Ice Age ""loosely based on climate change"" through an unanticipated global storm (you read that correctly), one paleoclimatologist attempts to traverse the US to try and find his son. Weather-related events then ensue across the world, ranging from gangs of tornadoes tearing up cities to feral wolf packs roaming New York (you read that correctly as well).Strangely, the cast for this story takes fewer liberties than the storyline: Jake Gyllenhaal and Dennis Quaid feature as the father-son duo and are the main focus of the film. However, you would be forgiven for forgetting their involvement in the movie, given the scale of events unfolding. The CGI'd environmental events just about passed the test at the time upon release, but given the 15-year gap since then, some of the larger catastrophes look slightly worse for wear (see ""Statue of Liberty survives 93m high tsunami"" for details). Realistically, there's not much more to see here than random events and a few misplaced romance scenes.It is important not to take this film seriously in any way, otherwise you risk becoming part of the demographic that hates this film for precisely the wrong reasons. The Day After Tomorrow is good because its bad - its merit is through forcing the most ridiculous environmental catastrophes all into one film, under the impression that everyone is at risk. Some people (worryingly so) use this film as an example not to ignore global warming; whilst their intentions are true, I don't really think this can be classed as a piece of literary merit.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Implausible, trite, and a waste of time...","The movie was a major disappointment for several reasons. The pseudo science it was based on was ludicrous, and the thinly veiled political propaganda that ran throughout this film made it painful to watch. The story line was pitifully trite, and the cast of stock characters only made the film more banal. Great special effects and multiple crisis situations were not enough to save this movie from what it was... a pathetic waste of time.When I watch a movie, I don't want to know where it's going after the first five minutes. I don't want to be able to predict characters' lines or actions before they happen. I want a movie that keeps me thinking, and continuously surprises me as it unfolds. The only thing I thought about while watching this movie was, ""When is it going to end?"" The only thing that surprised me was that people actually paid money to go see it at the theater. (I got my DVD copy of it in a bargain discount 2-pack with the cartoon, ""Ice Age"". Hmm, maybe that says something about the movie.)One of the movie's many inaccuracies that I can address with some authority was the scene where three RAF helicopters crashed on their way to rescue the British Royal Family at Balmoral Castle in Scotland. Okay, I'll buy the bit that their fuel lines froze up, killing their engines. However, that would not have stopped the choppers' rotors from spinning. Helicopter pilots sent to rescue the Queen of England and her family would have to have been some of the best in the RAF. It is extremely hard to believe that these pilots and co-pilots would not have known how to autorotate their whirlybirds to a safe landing after their engines died. (I have over 1,000 hours of flight time at the controls of four different helicopters in years gone by, and have done countless autorotations. This is not a difficult thing to do. Even student pilots have no problem performing this basic maneuver.) However, this terribly flawed movie shows all three helicopters spiraling out of control until they impact the ground.I guess I no longer have to warn people about wasting their money to go see it at the theater. It's long gone. However, if you're looking to add it to your DVD collection, wait until you find it in a bargain discount 2-pack for under $10.00. Don't load it into your DVD player until late at night, when you're having trouble getting to sleep.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Guilty pleasure,"I have to overrate this movie because I love it. But not in a ""so bad it's good"" kind of way. I think it's just really pleasant to watch. It's not really a good movie, but it's not awful either. Yes, a lot about it is silly. But it has great atmosphere and it looks amazing. I mean the shot of the Statue of Liberty covered in ice and snow? Come on.The worst parts are A) The ""happy ending"", when probably most of mankind has just been wiped out. ""Mr. President, we have great news! Ten people survived in New York!"" That's the worst scene of the movie by far.And B) Them not really explaining why Jack has to go to New York. Couldn't he have contacted the government right after talking to his son on the phone? Was it about bringing food or medicine? They never really tell you. Also didn't he say people must stay inside to survive?Rating this movie 7/10 is ridiculous but I have to give it a pass because it feels like one long lazy rainy Sunday afternoon.

Why did they burn books in a building full of wooden furniture?,"Aside from the poor science, writing, acting, plot, etc., the single most baffling thing in this piece of trash was the burning of books. If you're in a metal box surrounded by books fine burn 'em. But there was furniture and fixtures and doors that would burn much better then books. They would burn hotter, longer, and more efficiently then books. So anyways watch this crap if you want to see some nasty fake storms. That's about all this film has to offer. On a side note though, seeing a fake Cheney having nature slap him in the face with devastation was nice. And the fake Bush being so insecure and weak willed that he couldn't make a decision without his VP explicitly instructing him on the ""correct"" course made me giggle.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Day After Tomorrow - A Dangerous Piece of Environmental Hysteria,"Roland Emmerich's The Day After Tomorrow' presumes that if the ocean convection current that cycles warm water north from the Equator to the North Atlantic, where it cools and gets cycled back down to the Equator, gets `broken', Northern Europe will no longer be receiving warmth transferred from the Equator and will fall into a new Ice Age. This also means that the Equator will heat up, since it won't be receiving cooler water cycled down from the North.This, thankfully, is a big load -- at least as depicted in this film. Don't get me wrong; Global Warming is a very serious issue that requires further research on how it can be more efficiently controlled. I'm not remotely enough of an educated environmentalist to argue the issue vigorously with someone who is, but what little I do know, reinforced with a hefty dollop of gut feeling, strongly suggests to me that it's the right course. Hey, at least I am willing to admit my relative ignorance. Most environmental groups on the other hand are sadly and grossly misinformed about environmental science and, since they also simultaneously carry many other, stupid agendas (like antiglobalization), the last thing they want to do is bring science to the table, simply because it will upset their carefully constructed propagandized house of cards. The environmental movement is simply chocked full of nuts, some of which were undoubtedly behind the disaster that is The Day After Tomorrow.' I fear this film will hurt the cause far more than it will help.This leads to an obvious question: Is Emmerich (who got the chief writing credit here) one of these nuts, or was he simply looking for another cheap excuse to satisfy his New York City destruction fetish? Or did one of his story advisors deliberately feed him misinformation?With most popcorn flicks I might be inclined to just shut up about the science and take the movie on its own terms, as long as it adheres to whatever narrative and physical rules established up front, but this is supposed to be a serious environmental disaster film, a caveat to all us polluters and exploiters of Mother Nature. That the earth is warming up is no longer in doubt. Everyone at this point (even the greenhouse `skeptics' of the 90's) agree that there is a definite warming trend. But the scenario presented by Emmerich is based on theories that have been debunked long ago, depicted so very ludicrously they could almost serve as parody.Hell, this film does for the environmentalists what The Life of David Gale' did for death penalty abolitionists. Sanctimonious political hooey, all of it. And what rebuttal does the movie present? A pseudo-Dick Cheney babbling about the fragility of the American economy. Oh, and Americans illegally immigrating into Mexico. Ho-ho.This isn't supposed to be Ferngully' after all. THAT's why I'm looking for some logic and an at least rudimentary scientific basis.THAT's why I get angry when Jake Gyllenhaal doesn't loose his hand to frostbite after being outside on the ship with no glove.THAT's why I get angry when our protagonists can outrun a freeze during which the temperature drops ten degrees a second.THAT's why I get angry when an entire Ice Age comes and goes in four days.THAT's why I get angry when the cancer kid has to wait for an ambulance even though he's really only on oxygen.THAT's why I get angry when it never occurs to anyone in the library to burn the wooden furniture instead of valuable, historically significant booksTHAT's why I get angry when it never occurs to the trekkers that left the library to simply enter another building when the storm gets really bad.Of course I didn't initially consider The Day After Tomorrow' to be some sort of scientifically-based anti-pollution story. I mean, I sure didn't read any Lord of the Rings' reviews that stated `This film is a poorly-veiled commentary on the modern use of magic rings in military operations, damn it to hell.' Having seen The Day After Tomorrow,' though, it does seem true that Emmerich is torn between wanting to save America and wanting to level New York. And that Jack Hall fellow, the one I believe was the hero, with the son, he did have a fairly unsubtle speech to make: `Whether we survive depends on whether human beings can learn from our mistakes. What say you, my son?'Donnie Darko: `I survived, thanks to the books at my local library!'Ok, just as a thought experiment let's assume that this indeed was merely supposed to be a stupid blockbuster and see if it succeeds on that level. For instance, let us compare this film to the ultimate twister epic (because both had tornados in it), a little independent film by the name of Twister, starring that very wooden actor, Will Paxton. Or Bill Patton. No matter. While I never was a big fan of Twister', at least it built tension -- much like a good orgasm -- liberally spreading progressively bigger-getting tornadoes all the way through its taut narrative. The Day After Tomorrow,' however, blows it's wad far too early and then timidly asks the audience to cuddle for the next hour and a half. It's a classic case of premature tornado ejaculation.Now if the tornados had faces like that of the Master Control Program from Tron' and spoke in deep, falsetto voices before devouring L.A., that would be a different story.Hell, at least that volcano in Volcano' was one hell of a huge volcano, if you catch my drift. Also, I like to say `volcano'. Volcano. Sorry, I'll stop now.Volcano.I don't say this often, but screw Emmerich. Screw Emmerich up his sanctimonious, political, German arse. The guy should have stuck with bad Van Damme cyborg movies or German homoerotic low-budget rape/prison dramas of the future. That's what he's good at, people.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The storyline was well-written and well-explained, even though it was simple and easy to understand. The characters were interesting and likeable, but they weren't well-developed.

Would You Do A Neanderthal? The Question of the Ice Age,"The Day After Tomorrow is a well done action thriller where the world seems to fall at the hands of mother nature. Is it all the fault of the bad climates or do humans have something to do with it all? You will have to watch and see. Apart from the almost unreal consequences that rapidly seem to unfold during the course of the film, there are the usual parallel love stories and funny side characters that seem to have some say in the overall outcome of the story and other small nuances that make the audience laugh, or at the very lease, just smile. Would I have gone to see this in the theatres? No. In fact, I don't think it was in the theatres for very long, probably one of those summer flop films that survive for just entertainment. I do however think that there are some important messages that the US administration has to say at the end of the movie  almost touching, in fact. Aside from its oddly James Bond type title, be aware that the action is more real and the science more Bond-like. Be prepared to say ""that's just not true, and wouldn't happen.""

"It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine","In this laughable attempt at a global disaster movie, Dennis Quaid plays Jack Hall, a government paleoclimatologist researching the cause of the previous Ice Age in Antarctica when the entire Larsen B ice shelf decides to take a walk. He warns the United Nations that global warming is causing the icecaps to melt, which will ultimately result in a massive disruption of the Northern Hemisphere's moderate climate and a new Ice Age. Asked when this will occur, he opines, ""Maybe a hundred years, maybe a thousand."" Turns out he was about a hundred years off: the next day, the British Isles are at the centre of a massive storm system drawing supercooled air from the upper atmosphere, and all the Brits are Individually Quick Frozen. On the other side of the world, massive tornadoes unexpectedly destroy Los Angeles.Meanwhile, Hall's son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) and two friends are in New York City for an academic competition where, unbeknownst to them since the geniuses don't turn on the news, the next superstorm is forming right above their heads. A massive tidal wave strands them in the public library. After the newly formed Lake Manhattan freezes over, the majority of the library refugees decide to take their chances outside. Sam, his classmates, and about half a dozen others take shelter in a reading room and burn the books to keep warm, resulting in a pointless argument about censorship. (They couldn't have just burned Danielle Steel instead of Nietzsche? Better yet, how about the wooden furniture?) In the meantime, back in Washington, Hall learns that Sam is still alive in the Big Apsicle and, drawing on his experience in arctic climates, mounts an expedition with his two co-workers to rescue him.To call the science in The Day After Tomorrow ""implausible"" would be an understatement. Willful suspension of disbelief is simply impossible. Apparently Emmerich, wanting to sound a warning about the dangers of global warning, was aware that superstorms simply could not form in such a short time, yet decided to accelerate the action anyway for entertainment value. Put another way, he tried to make a serious point with a deliberately stupid plot. (Good plan.)Meanwhile, the human story is equally wretched, with the characters one-dimensional and the situations manipulative. Hall's wife, a doctor, elects to stay behind after everyone else at her hospital evacuates, so she can take care of the cute little bald boy with leukemia whose parents are missing. (Feel that tugging in your chest? It's Emmerich pulling on your heartstrings.) While walking to New York in a blizzard, tied together for safety, one of Hall's buddies falls through the skylight of a buried shopping mall. He cuts the rope, plummeting to his death, to save the others. (""Nooooooo!!!!"")On the other hand, the CGI (supplied by major effects houses such as ILM, Dream Quest, and Digital Domain, amongst others) is breathtaking for the most part, except for some rather obvious CG wolves.When you see ""Written by Roland Emmerich"" and ""Suggested by the book The Coming Global Superstorm by Art Bell and Whitley Streiber"" in the credits, you know you're not going to see a Nova documentary. Art Bell never saw a bit of crank science he didn't like. Once upon a time Emmerich wrote a wonderful movie called Stargate, but since then his screen writing talent has devolved into movies that are long on eye candy and short on intelligence, such as Independence Day and Godzilla. Emmerich appears to be in competition with Michael Bay (Armageddon, Pearl Harbor) to see who can produce the loudest, stupidest blockbuster before he dies. Thanks to The Day After Tomorrow, Emmerich takes a solid lead.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly","The Good; The special effects duh. Min blowing and bigger than Elvis. Whole lot of fun and if it wasn't for them this movie would be crap(er). Characters have a whole lot of potential if you completely ignore Dennis Quaid and there are some humorous moments in there. It's visually engaging and not too taxing on the ole noggin. I enjoyed the ending especially the fact that the so called first world now rely on the third world. So petty much an entertaining film HOWEVER.......The Bad; Great plot, story lines, sh*t* script. I mean REALLY! With some of the lines in that film I would sit there and just *cringe*. I understand that Emmerich or whoever worked on the script had less money to spend on writers and obviously more to spend on CGI but Oh.My.God!There also seems to be an obsession with the word 'cataclysmic'in this film again blame humiliating script. I mean why not try OTHER WORDS but I suppose the usage of the word cataclysmic over and over again was to attempt to make the plot 'seem' smarter. Somehow they failed that. But wait there's more crap...the science! Or lack thereof! What the hell are they talking about?! Some serious research should have been done into this and then maybe we wouldn't all be dying in the cinema aisles of shame.Plus the characters aren't given enough of a chance to develop and you get the feeling that Sam Hall doesn't really care for his mother and there is no explanation for why Jack Hall's character doesn't freeze to death. Does he only live through his magical powers as a lacklustre climatologist?The Ugly; I guess the wolves?.....oh no Dennis Quaid's facial expressions. He has all of three expressions; annoyed, really annoyed and constipated.All in all it's good to watch if you ignore the stale script and even staler acting. Some characters are interesting but of course since the world of Roland Emmerich revolves around the Hall family we don't find out much about the other folk in the film like the billions that died instead there is more attention paid again to the Hall family and extra girl played by Rossum. God forbid Emmy Rossum should get septicaemia and almost die screw those others out there (literally) freezing to death and let's just focus on her and her weird American accent. *Sigh* Despite this there ARE some memorable moments and it has truly excellent CGI. I would still recommend watching it because, despite it's many failings it *is* an entertaining movie. I gave it a rating of 8 purely because of Jake Gyllenhaal and the CGI. There I've said it. Watch it with suspended disbelief or when drunk. That way you can ignore certain Rhode Island wide plot holes. Enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Why didn't they burn the wooden furniture that was everywhere instead????

It terrifies me. It's so unsettling to think of the people in power ignoring the signs, because of ""costs"" and to think that my niece or nephews kids won't have a world to live in. The cost is life and it will be massive. This film shows only a Hollywood slice of what could happen and none of us are ready for it. If I'm honest, I keep forgetting how terrifying these type of films are. I felt nauseous for days after watching '2012', I don't watch the news because what I see scares me, so why do I put myself through this? It's a good film, that's why and I like good films, it does take a toll though.
This one gives slightly more hope than '2012' and isn't quite as forceful in its scare tactics, which is better for me. It also helps that it has a better cast including my favourite Jake and neck down Quaid.Global warming isn't a joke and it's not going away and it's sad that 16 years after this film was made we still need people like Greta to stand up for the whole planet. I'm sad to say that I stand with her mostly in spirit only and I wish I did more to help the situation.

Sure, there are plot holes galore and the scientific data is not completely plausible, but this was meant to entertain popcorn audiences on a grand level of spectacular special effects and stunts, and it succeeds brilliantly on that level, greatly aided by a pulsating background score that accentuates the shocks and a soundtrack that gives all the visuals an extra punch.My chief complaint, if we must insist on logic, is the fact that we have to accept the idea that a scientist would decide that he must walk to New York from Philadelphia at the height of the most drastic weather the world has ever known. This is where the script really requires the viewer to forget reason and concentrate on the stormy weather and chillingly spectacular photography.Clearly, this is meant to be nothing more than spellbinding entertainment for the masses, not a serious treatment of global warming despite such pretensions. Enjoy the awesome effects and forget logic. The viewer has to realize it's all in the realm of impossibility anyway--so stop nitpicking every little scientific point and enjoy what is meant to be riveting entertainment.The performances are all competent enough, nothing deep required. Dennis Quaid, Emmy Rossum, Sela Ward and Jake Gyllenhaal bring some humanity to the proceedings and make us believe in their dire predicaments. The understated romance between Rossum and Gyllenhaal is nicely handled. And speaking of the cinematography, the opening shot under the credits is one of the most visually stunning achievements in the whole film.Sit back and enjoy the thrill ride!!

To Kyoto Convention on Climate Change With Love,"Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) is a climatologist, who advises the American government about the problems of the greenhouse effect and global warming, but is not listened by the authorities. While his son Sam Hall (Jake Gyllenhaal) is in a competition with his school friends in New York, the north hemisphere has a sudden climate change, with huge hurricanes, tornadoes and waves and Manhattan is flooded, beginning a new Ice Age. Jack tries to save the life of his son. 'The Day After Tomorrow' recalls those type of movies very common in the 70's related to catastrophes. The difference is the very impressive state-of-art special effects. The storyline is very shallow, but the theme, which has been discussed for years in the Kyoto Convention, and the special-effects make this movie a worthwhile entertainment. This high-budget movie is not a film of characters, but visual and sound effects. The DVD has many Extras, but I have not watched them yet.

A good disaster movie(!),"Very few of these has come out for a while. A solid, good, disaster flick. Good use of CGI(Unlike Armageddon. Ugh.) and a good story, even if it's a bit unrealistic(Unlike Deep Impact. Ugh again). I usually laugh a bit at normal disaster flicks like Perfect Storm and the likes. This movie had me entertained but not laughing at it.Jake Gyllenhaal shows about 5% of his capacity(watch Jarhead and Donnie Darko) but it's OK. Acting is pretty general in this movie, no real stinkers or real stars. Again, no big deal. It's a disaster movie.The plot: Ice Age is abound and Dennis Quaid has to save his son from a frozen New York. There's even a nice Karl Rove-ish vice president in there not caring. Me like.The effects are, as I've said, very good. It's chilling to see a giant wave hit NY, especially after the recent disasters... Anyway, it's hard to elaborate on this movie.

"Recommended to teenagers uninterested in renting ""The Poseidon Adventure"" or ""Earthquake""","Hollywood keeps recycling its old, semi-forgotten titles--and when the beleaguered producers run out of those, they simply recycle the clichés therein. This doomsday thriller seems patched together with scenes from old Irwin Allen movies (although, granted, it's better than several of Allen's hackneyed yarns). The special effects are the star as the Northern hemisphere is headed for a new Ice Age; that doesn't seem to really bother scientist Dennis Quaid, who just wants to find his son (a resourceful lad who manages to find a working pay-phone in New York City's downtown library). The director is a hack who sets up the same momentum in every lazy circumstance: panic situation, near-peril, rescue, reward.

Why leave the Penthouse?,"1. Someone explain the rationale of ever setting foot outside the NY Penthouse?

The cancer victim had out sympathy--but it should have been pointed out that as bad as it is for a kid to have cancer, it's worse to be a kid with cancer during an ensuing ice age.

A visual treat... nothing else.,"Movies like ""The Day After Tomorrow"" always have certain goals to fulfill. There are few films that set goals in every strata of cinema and fulfill them. Films like ""Day after Tomorrow"" do not set goals in all strata, the primary objective of them is to provide the cinema-goers the maximum visual treat. All others are just to hold up a story to make it into a film. So this film is filled with unscientific plot, childish story lines, cheap clichés and laughable script. I wouldn't be surprised if it had worse acting performances. They were lucky to get decent actors like Quaid, Gylenhaal or Rossum.What I mean to say is, watching this film in a big screen theatre with good sound is indeed a treat. There are a number of scenes where the audience applauded heartily. Once again, one can't help praising the marvel of modern computerized special effects after this film. That was the film's primary objective and it passed that exam with distinction.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Though I would've liked it more,"The Day After Tomorrow - It's big, it's loud, it's expensive, it's interesting... but is it truly any good? When I first saw the promo's of this film, I instantly loved it, claiming it would be not only a summer blockbuster but a possible instant classic as well. Although Emmerich made some crappy films over the years (Godzilla comes to mind), he's still a director with a good eye for incredible action scenes. Independence Day and even the cheap Moon 44 are proof of that. Plus, in The Day After Tomorrow, he had a chance of working with young talents (Jake Gyllenhaal truly is a good actor), as well as perhaps the best actor around (Ian Holm). Although it's too bad the latter doesn't really appear on screen as much as I wanted.So, expectations were high. But, although The Day After Tomorrow doesn't fail on all accounts, I must say I was a tad disappointed in the outcome. In the beginning of the movie, it takes too many too well known steps (politicians not believing the scientists, etc.), and too soon you're feeling like: alright, get on with it.When it does get on (the weather horror, that is), it all looks amazing, but the movie then is seriously damaged by some family/love stories that just won't work. Gyllenhaal and Rossum don't have any chemistry going on and when Quaid is coming out to get his son things just are getting silly.One last thought about the ending: I can understand how many people dislike it, but it's somehow a bold statement by Emmerich to make it end like that, so I'm not gonna bash him for that.In short: phenomenal effects, interesting ideas, but the movie is a bit spoiled by relationships which just won't work. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

It even explains and shows loyal friendships. It shows us the politics that are happening behind the curtain. And again, the graphics! For a film that was made in 2004 i loved the graphics.

"Great, realistic and one of the best movies of 2004","I had high expectations 2 years ago when the trailers of the movies which were a lot and looked really promising and scary. I have always considered Emmerich as an average director who is given high budget projects and he directs them in not a bad way, but people can't see what he is good at and that's why he remains an average director. Kinda Michael Bay probably. High budget, amazing special effects, entertaining, kinda optimistic and so on. This is the reason movies like Independence Day and Godzilla are rated low and are examples of bad movies although I like both of them a lot.Now about The Day After Tomorrow - I consider it as Emmerich's best movie. It's nicely directed, it's realistic and authentic which makes it scary it some ways and a little distant from the other light summer blockbusters and 2004 had many, many summer blockbusters.The special effects were incredible which is not that much of a surprise since many people talk about how The Day After Tomorrow depends on these action/destruction special effects scene. Nah, I don't think so, but I love special effects and this time they are special and make the movie realistic. I don't remember which guy from the crew said that, but it sounded very true:""If we hadn't hurry finish the movie, we would have been making a documentary"". The end of the world topic is nicely stressed although we finally have some personal views for the nightmare.The soundtrack is great and I loved some themes, especially the one from the documentary of the movie. It's a sad theme about how many people die due to the the beginning of another glacial age.The acting is OK for such a movie. The story is not that personal, but considering that in Independence Day, the president was one of the characters, it is personal indeed. A father and son drama and characters not related with our main characters who personally I cared for, like the sick kid and the female doctor.Overall The Day After Tomorrow is a great movie and although 2004 wasn't that much of a great movie year, it was something I would watch again, something that entertained me, something that amazed me at that period and it used to be a very favorite movie of mine 20 months ago, but I watched many, many classics since then and I changed my opinion. It was a good period and I will always remember some of my very first favorite movies even if they are not included in my top 10 of all time anymore. Just a good memory. And I wish Emmerich luck with his new project which promises to be something the fans would like to see and if they like it, they will start having respect for Emmerich which is going to be a progress in his career although his career has never been and it will never be something special.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Tomorrow May Never Come, as you'll regret the lost two hours of this crap fest","I'm going to break this down piece by piece as I recall my experience with this film from last night.Opening Credits: Could barely read them as they were horribly concocted, however, they did bring my only smile of the night to me when I saw Tamlyn Tamita's name warped across the bottom of the screen. Go Laurel Takashima!Eventually, the first unrealistic event happens, a large chunk of the arctic shelf breaks off, amazingly down the middle of our hero's camp, and only a 4 or 5 feet wide crack is created through there.You know, scratch it, I don't want to recount this movie. Let me just fill you in on what it is.It's a rehash of Emmerich's tried and true destroy stuff disaster movies, and he even destroys the same round tower building in LA again, just like in ID4. Unlike ID4, there are no redeeming performances by Will Smith to make this movie bearable.You will love this movie, however, if you think the U.S. is evil, believe our climate is very fragile, believe that 3rd world nations have it right and we will grovel before them, and believe that it is better to wipe out half the world to have cleaner air.Emmerich also seems to think that North America only has 2 cities worth caring about being destroyed, NY and LA.A horrendous 1 out of 10, and 2 hours of your life you will never reclaim.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A Great Ride!,"Much has been made of the scientific impossibility of the very premise of this movie: climate change happens incrementally, not suddenly as it's portrayed here. Point made, I suppose, but those who make this criticism forget the basic point involved in making a movie: you want to entertain the viewers. While this may be scientifically inaccurate, it's an amazing ride. (And, for those concerned with the inaccuracy of sudden climate change, it's worth noting that the scientists portrayed in this movie also conceded that this shouldn't be happening this fast. That was part of the mystery to it all.) From start to finish, this film has everything a good movie needs: action, real suspense, good if not spectacular performances and absolutely amazing special effects. I thought the movie weakened a bit in the second half, as the focus shifted away from the mystery involved in the climate change and took on a fairly predictable rescue format. It also came across as a bit preachy at times; with barely disguised shots at governments about the failure to really take action on global warming. (Did I also detect a shot at the Bush administration? Perry King and Kenneth Welsh as the President and Vice President respectively bore something of a physical resemblance - I thought - to Bush/Cheney, and in this movie it was rather clear that the Vice President was calling the shots.) The movie could have been cut a bit in the last 45 minutes or so. In particular, the wolf scene on the ship struck me as unnecessary and somewhat tedious.Still, this was an entertaining movie that kept going all the way through, even if it was slowing down just a bit by the end. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Egregiously Clichéd. Horrid Screenplay. Mediocre Acting. Thinly Veiled Politics.,"Wow. That was my first word to my friend with whom I saw this movie as soon as I stepped from the theatre.Wow because, to be honest I could barely believe that this movie made it past Hollywood quality control (not that it's been known to be all that efficient anyway).There are 2 reasons I actually felt mental anguish watching this movie, and 1 marginally redeeming quality. To start with the latter observation, I have to give them credit for putting together some quality special effects. All of the disaster sequences were excellently done, and at no point did I feel that it was too computerized or lacked visual believability. It could be worth the watch just for the effects.Now, on to the two big critiques... (and let me emphasize big).1) Screenplay, Acting & Story.Quite possibly the most painfully clichéd screenplay I have ever seen. Not to mention that it was not really written in English, but rather ""Kindergarten"". I mean, we don't go to big budget movies like this to feel inspired by philosophical dialogue, but come on, you can at least do better than this. I actually felt pained watching some of the scenes (especially those melodramatic ones from Dennis Quaid going after Jake Gyllenhaal in NY...) and I know I wasn't the only one. I had never heard so many groans so frequently in a theatre before. Furthermore, the wafer-thin plot about the ""distanced father"" who realizes his mistake of not paying enough attention to his son on account of being too committed to his job, etc etc etc is so overused and boring it does nothing but detract from the rest of the movie.The acting was mediocre, but don't get me wrong, I like Jake Gyllenhaal and Dennis Quaid... it's just that there isn't much they could have done with this crap.2) The ""Message"".Now, let me preface this by saying that I realize this is ""just a movie"", but still, it is a movie that is meant to have a highly political message.... and the way they pass off this supposedly wise message ensures that this movie goes down in my books as one of the worst I have ever endured. OK, global warming is a controversial issue, and there opposing opinions, and this is just one of them, fine. But, I felt that the whole time the makers of this movie were just trying to stuff every conceivable facet of social justice down my throat at every possible opportunity. It wasn't just global warming, it was third world debt relief, anti-statism, the rich-poor divide.... etc etc etc. Regardless of my personal view on climate change (I think it's a complicated issue, and I did my degree in evolutionary genetics and had all the opposing and supporting arguments driven into my head, so I am not just some left or right clone on the matter...) I couldn't help but feel somewhat violated by the constant presence of such an over-arching political agenda - almost as though the director felt I was an idiot and would buy these messages as profound or substantiated. Probably the worst was the new President's speech at the end when he starts talking about Americans ""reaching out"" to their 3rd world guests, and that whole line where he basically says ""We used to think we could burn fossil fuels with reckless abandon. We were wrong. I was wrong.""... I almost choked on the cheese. Another was the ""classic"" scene with the homeless man showing the rich-kid how to stuff newspapers in his shirt for warmth... how touching...and transparent. I mean, couldn't you guys have just stuck to the one message (global climate change), rather than trying so obviously hard to force every other possible social justice issue in? In some ways this movie may as well have been a propaganda film for the Green Party and/or Comintern. And for those that would respond to me by saying ""it's just a movie"", yes, it is, but so is ""Triumph of the Will"", and I believe this movie comes close to deserving the same skeptical treatment we give to that, otherwise well-done, film.And also, before anyone accuses me of being a ""Bush-Clone"" or ""right-winger"" or some nonsense, let me point out that I would have equally scornful words to say about a movie that promoted the opposite agenda in such a ridiculous way.On a side note...I can't imagine how anyone who is actually concerned about Global Warming or these other issues could really feel this helped their cause... if anything it presented the case in such an amateur and dumbed-down way that it actually takes away credibility from the issue.So, overall, I conclude by saying this: Great effects, decent disaster scenes, but clichéd to the point of physical discomfort, inexcusably bad screenplay, and, worst of all, intolerably riddled with thinly veiled (if at all) political messages that are forced down your throat at all opportunities (appropriate or not).",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Too much Hollywood in the second half, but still something to see","I always like to go and see Roland Emmerich films, that's real popcorn cinema to me. Since I liked the preview too, I was surely going to see it.This film shows how the northern hemisphere gets thrown into a new ice age, thanks to global warming, that will melt most of the north pole's ice, which in turn will make the gulf stream stop. Chaotic weather, with tornadoes by the dozen, huge storms and temperature dropping by a hundred degrees in the centre of the three continent-wide storms destroy our civilization. The southern half of the US of A have to run for shelter in Mexico (where it's just snowing, nothing else), and the northern states just have to sit it out. Same in Europe and in Asia, which gets barely mentioned (apart from a few seconds in Scotland). That's the first half of the film. I really liked that a lot! Great effects, and it all sounds not so wrong. There was plenty of stunning scenes, and a good tempo.The second half of the film then simply became like so many other catastrophe films. The one scientist who was warning of what will happen, is in Washington DC, and his sun is stuck in New York, sitting the winter storm out in the central library. Daddy has to go and rescue him. Certainly he will make it.As usual with Emmerich (good for his wallet), the end was a bit too much Hollywood, too happy end, but okay. I just wish it would have been him finding his son and that group and them setting out (still on snow-shoes) to go to Mexico or wherever. End scene them disappearing into the snowy landscape. Full Stop. But no, certainly the good US army had to fly in with their good helicopters to save the good people, and hundreds if not thousands of other good people that suddenly appeared on the rooftops of the skyscrapers of NYC. Where did they survive? No one knows. Why did they not set out to go to the south, like the majority of the library group? No one knows. Did they have the same knowledge as the remaining group in the library, being warned by the ONE scientist who understood what's happening about leaving? Definitely not.I give the first part 9 and the second part 5 out of 10 = 7 overall points!",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Scientifically Grounded But with Exaggerated Timing,"Watching 'The Day After Tomorrow,' I realized that the events depicted in the film are actually based on real scientific principles. Concepts like the weakening of the North Atlantic Current, glacial melt, and extreme weather events are important topics in climate science and are still being discussed today. However, the idea that these events could unfold within a matter of days is certainly an exaggeration.That being said, the film made me think. It tries to deliver an important message about the impacts of climate change while also providing a thrilling, visually stunning adventure. Scenes like the massive waves flooding New York are truly impressive and stay with you long after the movie ends.Of course, if you're someone who wants strict scientific accuracy, the timing in this film might be a bit hard to swallow. But I saw the film as more of a warning. Climate change is real and its effects can be significant, just not as dramatically fast as the movie portrays. In the end, 'The Day After Tomorrow' offered me both an exciting adventure and a meaningful message to ponder.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"A solid, entertaining disaster movie","The Day After Tomorrow is a workmanlike disaster movie that takes its premise seriously but not so much so that it fails as the light entertainment it is meant to be.   DAT doesn't so much avoid the cliches of the genre as uses them intelligently. Director Roland Emmerich captures the good, old fashioned fun of cinematic catastrophe while avoiding the melodramatics that mar movies like The Towering Inferno and The Poseidon Adventure.The movie opens with a large chunk of the Antarctic ice cap falling into the ocean.  Scientist Jack Hall witnesses the event and, with the help of a computer model designed to study ancient weather patterns, predicts that global warming is going to cause a new ice age.  In fact it soon becomes clear that the climate reversals that Hall thought would take a century or more are occurring at a vastly accelerated rate.  Within days the Northern Hemisphere is beset by biblical disasters and glaciers begin galloping southward.  It is at this point Hall heads off for frozen New York to save his estranged son. Critics have sneered at this, citing ersatz family drama as a disaster movie cliche.  The critics would have been right if situations like these were used for campy histrionics.  Instead DAT makes a smart choice. Rather than have the cast emote frantically the movie leaves the theatrics to the CGI technicians.  As a result the quiet tragedies the characters face stand out in relief against the cacophony of disaster that surrounds them.Dennis Quaid shines as Hall, the heroic scientist and absentee father. His intensity and utter seriousness keep the role from being consumed by its own cliches. Ian Holm is his usual memorable self as a doomed Scottish meteorologist and Kenneth Welsh gives his wrong headed US Vice President more depth than called for.  Jake Gyllenhaal and Emmy Rossum are fine as the endangered son and his love interest.  Together they avoid what could have been sappy pitfalls and managed to inject a little humor into their predicament.DAT fulfills its apocalyptic premise by giving you all manner of spectacular destruction.  Tornados, blizzards and tidal waves rip across the screen with all the wild abandon one could wish for.  Is it all convincingly real? Nope. Not at all.  In DAT they have to ravish the whole Northern Hemisphere on essentially the same budget that powered just one hurricane in Twister. Exacting realism just isn't in the cards. So, instead of quality, the movie goes for imaginative quantity. You are treated to the sight of three twisters tearing the heart out of Los Angeles, a wall of water cleansing the dirty streets of New York, a tanker floating down Broadway and the Statue of Liberty waist deep in a snow drift.The Day After Tomorrow has become a lighting rod for undeserved criticism, most of it lambasting it for having the audacity to be a disaster movie. This is something like cursing the sky for being blue.  So be warned, if you don't like disaster flicks DAT won't change your mind.  You might even think twice about spending eight dollars to see it. But it is worth matinee prices to experience the spectacle on a wide screen.  If it sounds like I'm damning this movie with faint praise I'm really not.  DAD is an enjoyable movie that does its job well. If disaster is what you are in the mood for you cannot go wrong, just don't expect it to shatter your senses.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

And the Weather for This Week....This Can't Be Right.,"Disaster epic that reminds you of films that became box office smashes in the 1970s. ""The Day After Tomorrow"" is fair for the genre, but ultimately its landmark special effects, haunting score, outstanding sound and surprisingly impressive cinematography is not enough to overcome cardboard-styled characters and a screenplay that really does nothing new or innovative. Climatologist Dennis Quaid believes that problems with global warming that have been ignored over the years will become real factors in possibly killing the human race in 1,000 or possibly only 100 years. Naturally his pleas to international delegates fall on deaf ears (most notably from U.S. vice president Kenneth Welsh). Of course we all know immediately that Quaid's predictions will come true and come true very quickly. Soon a whole host of characters get involved in destruction around the world as Los Angeles experiences killer twisters, D.C. falls to heavy snowfall and chilling temperatures (in the -100s Fahrenheit) while New York literally sinks due to heavy floods and future Ice Age-type elements. Quaid's son (Jake Gyllenhall), his love interest (Emmy Rossum), their group of high school academic competition players and a whole host of others (homeless man Glenn Plummer in particular) get stuck in the city's library. The test is to stay alive by staying warm. The entire country does its best to get as far south as possible (even going so far as to invade Mexico) to overcome the natural disasters. Quaid's wife (doctor Sela Ward) gets stuck in D.C. looking after a young cancer patient, while scientist Ian Holm and others become stranded in Europe. And through it all Quaid, assistants Dash Mihok and Jay O. Sanders go against convention to save Gyllenhall and others who may potentially survive the elements in New York City. ""The Day After Tomorrow"" is pretty good with its tone (admittedly there are some thought-provoking and scary possibilities presented here), but the movie turns to old cliches and tiring screenplay techniques to add to its length. The human aspect is the real minus (this is of course a very huge problem) as so many good things get overshadowed by the most important aspects of the cinema being near non-existent (direction, characterization and screenplay). 2.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A thought-provoking movie,"One day, climate scholars, Jack Hall finds a big crevice in the South Pole and tries to inform a vice-president about that and tells that the cause of the problem is global warming.Moreover,he tells that by melting of ice, a direction of an ocean current was changed and it causes a change of a current of air. As a result, those change brought about the start of the ice age. However a vice-president ignored his warning and didn't take action, so an extraordinary natural phenomenon happens and survival of human beings including Jack and his son, Sam, starts.This movie is a thought-provoking movie and good for many people to think about the environment.

Entertaining enough to keep me satisfied.,"Over the years we've certainly seen our share of natural disaster movies - some excellent (think 'Armageddon', 'Dante's Peak', 'Twister'), some excruciatingly bad (think '2012' and 'GeoStorm'). 'The Day after Tomorrow' falls in the good category - not excellent, not bad, and certainly better than bad.The characters are cliched. The storms and disasters are bigger than realistically possible, and sensational. The events are highly improbable. And there's that darn obligatory Hollywood love interest - why, just why must it be in almost every movie? There's no place for a newfound love story in this movie. If you want to add romance, have it between a couple that's been married or going out for some time. Not the ""oh, I just realized I'm in love"" scenario...pfff!Off course there are the usual credibility issues. People make it out of situations that's just impossible for them to do so. I guess sensationalism outweighs reality in Hollywood. The film even gets over-sentimental at times. Despite this, though, 'The Day after Tomorrow' is an exciting adventure thriller. It poses the 'what if' scenario and I suppose one shouldn't take it too seriously or try to analyze the facts. This is for entertainment purpose only, and in that regard it succeeds. The visual effects are good and the disaster scenes are very well made. Watch it for what it is and you will be entertained. I enjoyed it.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Highly entertaining first-half let down by dull second-half.,"Director Roland Emmerich of Independence Day and the shoddy Godzilla Remake fame brings us probably the least accurate but best looking global warming warning to date.

Most of Britain under ice? Tornados in Hollywood? It's a tad stretched but for what it's worth the first 40 minutes of The Day After Tomorrow are sheep brilliance dabbling into emotion and not being afraid to dazzle with its monuments effects.It's a crying shame then that once those 40 minutes are up the film revels its dull serious side. Jumping from unconvincing problem to unconvincing problem back upped by the ultimately charisma drained Dennis Quaid and a forgivably forgettable performance form Jake Gyllenhal makes The Day After Tomorrow a very mixed bag.Directed by Roland Emmerich, this mega-budget, special-effects-laden epic revolves around the onset of an international series of crises brought on by the long-term results of the greenhouse effect.At the eye of the storm is paleoclimatologist (a professor dedicated to the study of weather patterns throughout the ages) Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid), who voluntarily takes on the preservation of the world in voluntarily takes on the preservation of the world in the dawn of the next ice age and all the disaster that comes along with it -- violent hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, tidal waves, massive floods, etc.Hall must also contact his son, Sam (Jake Gyllenhal), who was in the middle of an academic competition in New York City when the chaos begun. In addition to facing the largest-scale onslaught of natural catastrophes in the history of humankind, Jack, in his journey north, must contend with the masses fleeing south in an attempt to resettle in a warmer climate. The Day After Tomorrow also features Emma Rossum, Sela Ward, and Joe Cobden. All of whom do a respectable job at providing the often much needed support.Director Roland Emmerich has had his ups and he has had his downs. Anybody's whose read my 10,000 BC review will know what I mean by downs and what with that terrible Godzilla remake still leaving a mark its odd how the director of the critically acclaimed Independence Day can sink to such a low quality. With The Day After Tomorrow despite its flaws it does enter the group marked the Directors best what with this and Independence Day being his only real success.My Final Verdict? If only this movie were 40 minutes long then maybe the ending wouldn't be so darn dull. Even still this is entertaining viewing that should not be missed but never should be taken seriously. Global Warming truly isn't such a problem.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
With some over the top scene's and cliché dialogue i still enjoyed it,"This is most likely Emmerich's best film so far. The plot and science may be a bit ""off"" but that doesn't take away from the fact that it's an enjoyable film. Disaster films aren't Pulp Fiction or The Godfather, in fact every disaster movie ever created is never rated high.Jake Gyllenhall gives a great performance as does Dennis Quaid. It is always important to have strong Actors to tackle on serious drama films. I doubt this film would've been enjoyable with Zac Efron and Jim Carey as the son/ father duo. Jake is now a true power house of an Actor, and Dennis has been for a while. The rest of the ensemble does a fantastic job as well.The story is by far the weakest link in the movie. While i'm not referring to the whole global warming, i'm actually talking about the decisions that the Characters have to make in the film and the consequences that follows. The Science too, but that can be forgiven with the all time favorite three words ""Suspense of disbelief""The CGI in the film was great. Arguable better then most films that had a bigger budget that were released the same year or later, The whole disasters were pretty cool. the atmosphere that the film builds does put you on edge and you do feel part of the story,which is awesome.Like i said before, this is an enjoyable film, with great cast and great CGI with the only few downsides being some story plot holes.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I love this movie,"Not sure why it has such a low rating. It's incredibly entertaining and, let's be honest at this point, it's more like a documentary. I'm a big fan of apocalyptic dystopian movies and I've watched it at least 20 times by now. The graphics and imagery of the extreme weather are pretty great and the movie on the whole I would consider a horror movie.There's just something about it, in its horror, that's comforting.

The Chill Got Me,"In short, this film is about a national emergency, like many other Roland Emmerich films. What makes this one different is that it entertains the concept of the world going through another ice age - the day after tomorrow.While many critics and professionals concerned with national emergencies and meteorology denounced the possibly of this film ever being reality, it still makes for an interesting story.Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) is a climatologist, who, along with help of Terry Rapson (Ian Holm) discovers that the climate is changing at a rapid rate due to the shifting currents in the Atlantic Ocean. As the thermometer begins its plummet, Jack races to try and rescue his teenage son (Jake Glyllenhaal-a.k.a.: Donnie Darko) and a group of friends to safety.I do have to say that one scene with a bunch of CG (computer-generated) wolves is pretty lame, although intended to be suspenseful. Dennis and Jake play a good father/son team and all the other acting is well done. I was especially enthralled with Emmy Rossum. She reminds me of a young Mia Sara.I see her acting career going a long way! Sela Ward adds a few heartfelt moments (why isn't she in more movies?). What was most entertaining/laughable was as I was watching this film, myself and a bunch of friends started to feel cold. By the end of the movie, we all felt freezing!

That statement destroys Climate Activist messages. If there was a cataclysmic climate event thousands of years before the industrial age and before humans began polluting the environment, how can you point to man as being either the cause or cure for the next Climate Event????

"Roland Emmerich makes up for ""Independence Day"" and ""Godzilla"".","Knowing that ""The Day After Tomorrow"" is directed by the same guy behind Hollywood garbage such as ""Independence Day"" and ""Godzilla"", a person would likely assume this movie to be the same. In fact, this one is much different. Portraying global warming unleashing an ice age across the northern hemisphere, the movie should be a warning to us (especially after Hurricane Katrina).When the movie came out, there was some controversy about the vice president looking very similar to Dick Cheney. I wish to assert that it's appropriate for him to resemble the Bush administration, given the way that the Bush administration pursues policies increasing global warming.All in all, this is a popcorn movie - and (hopefully) improbable - but definitely worth seeing.

Below Average Disaster Movie,"Some interesting scenes, but mostly this apocalyptic mess fails as an entertaining movie.Seventies disaster movies meet global warming. As you can expect, this is a movie where contrived rescue missions and horrible acting meet relentless demographic scanning.Almost all the Black characters in here are geeks, Emmy Rossum (""Mystic River"") continually has this crazy eyed expression, Jake Gyllenhaal's ""cute"" acting is getting boring really quickly and is strictly aimed at teen-aged girls, and the Dennis Quaid/Harrison Ford role is a little too ""heroic"" and unthinking at the same time.To top it all off, two regulars from the ""24"" TV series are in there, AND the lead character is called ""Jack"".The plot devices come on heavy and strong. You cringe, every time someone suggests ""let's take the plane"" or ""let's take the train"". Of course Jack's son is in Manhattan. Of course Jack will try and walk there, even though we have just seen seasoned RAF pilots turn into popsicles in the blink of an eye. You cringe when Emmy Rossum risks her life to retrieve a passport, even though a 100 foot wall of water is raging toward her. She survives by walking up a flight of stairs, of course, otherwise the love interest would have disappeared from the story. And what would a movie about the next ice age be without a love interest.Like so many movies, this one started off as a good idea, and the movie was sort of organized around that idea. As a result, no one managed to stop and think about a plot.Recommended only if you are a hardcore disaster movie fan and want to be able to say ""I have seen them all"".",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

There are very dramatic moments in the film which do justice to the people who deliver the lines.The major problem being the pseudo-science presented as likely possibility has ruined an otherwise fun film. It comes off as very preachy towards the viewers who paid just to see the special effects.

"The Day After Tomorrow ends the world better than most natural disaster films, with an experienced disaster director and a grounded premise.","Roland Emmerich, the master of disaster, created one of the quintessential apocalyptic natural disaster films with The Day After Tomorrow. Floods, tsunamis, hail, suddenly dropping temperatures, and more all make their way into the perils of this film. The movie follows Dennis Quaid's climatologist as he warns the world of a quickly returning ice age. Once the global freeze catches humanity unprepared, survivors struggle against the impossible temperatures to find shelter and hope. The film sets itself apart with its cinematography featuring the expansive frozen wastelands and iconic monuments captured in ice. Performances are solid with a cast like Quaid, Gyllenhaal, and Rossum. The story is simple, which works for a disaster survival flick. The Day After Tomorrow is special compared to other big-budget catastrophe events because it is a little more grounded compared to some of the more outrageous films of Emmerich's more recent filmography, like Moonfall or 2012 but still benefits from a director that excels at destroying historic landmarks on the big screen.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

God help us all!,"Not that we might face another ice age at some time, but that this truly awful film could take so much at the box office.I knew this was a disaster movie before I saw it and so did not expect too much. Disaster movies are more about shock/thrill factor than anything else, but most of them in the past have been, at least somewhat, believable. What I did not expect was to watch a film where everything but special effects was dis-regarded. It would appear that the old saying about what makes a good movie has changed. Instead of script, script and script.. It is now special effects, special effects and CGI.And it gets worse..Even when the movie is not using special effects and relies on the plot or characters to make a point it fails miserably through lack of thought and plausibility. The best example of this (and only one of many implausible plot points) is the book burning scene(s). Forget if you will, for a moment, the philosophical issues and think about the practical issues involved:We need to keep warm : OK let's find something to burn in the fire : Hey look! Loads of books, they should burn well.Ahem, look around you.What are books stored on? Yes, that's right, bookshelves : What are bookshelves made of? Very good, you're getting the idea now. Now the final question, and this is the real tester: What burns longer, better and gives off more heat, paper or wood? And while you are trying to resolve that little problem in your head, look around you. What do you see? A library that is full of tables and chairs. The walls are panelled with what?Our forlorn heroes could not work this out. And we were told earlier in the movie that one of these heroes is so intelligent that he is smarter than the teacher that had the audacity to flunk him. The same high IQ possessing hero that had the intelligence to chat on the phone while he stood in a rising flood of icy cold water that was to be his doom in seconds flat.Oh well, enough said.

A Pretty Good Movie Based On An Outlandish Scenario,"After viewing ""Independence Day,"" which was brought to you by the same directors, I was expecting a total piece of crap, and as I don't believe most of the claims coming from the ""global warming"" crowd, I was pleasantly surprised to find that ""The Day After Tomorrow"" was a fairly well-crafted movie. The cinematography and the effects were quite good, the writing not bad, and the acting reasonably convincing, with an emotional ending that was better than might be expected. Of course, the premise is strictly science fiction, and not very good science fiction, so for people to take this story seriously is absurd. Frankly, I still don't get how ""global warming"" is supposed to trigger an ice age, but I have yet to figure out how sketchy and contradictory data regarding an alleged slight increase in ocean temperature can be plugged into flawed computer models of a climate we barely understand, extrapolated for a century, and then somehow used to ""prove"" the hypothesis of ""global warming."" I also don't understand how apparent regional warming automatically indicates ""global warming,"" or how a bunch of hurricanes one year are a direct result of it, while almost no hurricanes the next year is simply ignored. That several ""peer reviewed"" scientific journals seem to accept this research and routinely suppress all evidence and opinion to the contrary is another matter altogether. I can accept that the increase in human population, coupled with expanded industrialization in Asia and the Third World is going to have some negative environmental effects, but not enough to produce any significant ""global warming."" After all, CO2 is not the primary greenhouse gas. Water vapor is, and that is produced naturally. Further, we are in an interglacial period, the last ice age having occurred about 11,000 years ago and the next one expected in a few thousand more years. Finally, the earth's temperature has varied considerably over geologic time. It has been cooler than it is now and much warmer, too. I just can't buy this ""global warming"" crap and I have yet to hear any convincing arguments to the contrary by anyone whose opinion I respect. A far more pressing question, biologically speaking, is how soon we are going to reach the carrying capacity of the biosphere to support human life. In this regard, there are many ways that nature could work to substantially reduce the human population, ""global warming"" being one of the least likely. A series of pandemics or droughts followed by mass starvation are but two examples.Unfortunately, that ""global warming"" advocates continue to push this sort of fantasy is one reason why the environmental movement is given so little credibility by too many people these days. Guys like Rush Limbaugh, who may understand politics and economics fairly well but who is a total boob when it comes to Biology, gets away with calling serious intellectuals ""environmentalist whackos"" and nobody is able to refute his ignorant bigotry effectively. When so many other people seriously believe the outlandish claims made in movies such as this one, it is no wonder.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Worst movie I've seen in a VERY long time,"Well, this is the sort of garbage you get to sit through when you go to visit your parents for Christmas and they rent a movie, coming home with something that was recommended to them by the video store clerk. ""It has a lot of special effects"" being the precise quote.First off, it's an utterly run of the mill disaster flick. Every cliché known to modern man is piled on here. The main actor walks 40 miles through the blizzard of the century to save his kid, in a couple of days. His wife is a doctor who is willing to face certain death, just so she can be there with her little cancer patient. His son is so brilliant that his calculus teacher flunked him for excessive brilliance (It's more than a bit obvious that the people who wrote this never made it past 7th grade math). In the end, guess what? All the main characters survive. After causing the death of his buddies by making them go on this ludicrous trek, dad arrives to save his son, who doesn't need saving at all. They hug and dad announces that they'll spend more time together, you know, playing catch and stuff. Mom successfully finds an ambulance to drive hundreds of miles through 15 foot deep snow, and her little cancer patient survives, opening his eyes as the happy theme music swells in the background. For the love of god, this thing just sucks.There are enough subplots to fill an extra large chamber pot, all of them sappy and idiotic and totally unbelievable.The special effects are pretty lousy as well. Although the scene of New York getting hit with a massive tsunami looks okay in spots, it looks pretty bad in other spots. Most of the other special effects just scream COMPUTER GENERATED EFFECTS!!! There's even a pack of wolves running around that are obviously CGI.As far as the science behind this ""very serious"" global warming propaganda piece from your left-wing liberal folks in Hollywood, well, there's really no sarcastic put-down that even comes close to summing up the idiocy of it all. As someone else said, it's like the aliens from Independence Day came back, this time armed with a big freeze ray. It makes one wonder - if the people who are running around yelling ""the sky is falling"" are really this utterly imbecilic when it comes to science, well, my god, why are we listening to this tripe?I would recommend this movie only to people who say things like ""I loved the new Star Wars trilogy.

You could really believe he was a paleoclimatologist, as well as a devoted father. Dennis' acting is so natural, he makes it look easy. Jake Gyllenhaal was perfect as his son, showing the typical emotions of a teenager, unsure of himself at first and then starting to take control of the situation, proving to be as capable as his father. Emmy Rossum was very credible as Jake's girlfriend and Sela Ward was just right as Jake's mom. Ian Holm was the elderly Scottish scientist, keeping a stiff upper lip while the weather was going haywire.

A Cheesy Climate Catastrophe,"""The Day After Tomorrow"" comes across as a film that's hard to take seriously. Its portrayal of an environmental apocalypse, fueled by exaggerated global warming effects, borders on the far-fetched, and the CGI does little to bolster its credibility. The science behind the plot is tenuous, making it difficult to immerse oneself in the narrative fully.Despite these shortcomings, Jake Gyllenhaal's presence in the film is a saving grace. His ability to bring life to his characters adds a layer of enjoyment to an otherwise over-the-top storyline. This film feels like one of those low-budget productions perpetually airing on cable TV - always available, yet seldom chosen for viewing.The premise of the movie is straightforward yet dramatic: global warming triggers a series of catastrophic events, leading to flash floods, enormous hail storms, and unprecedentedly rapid drops in temperature. It falls into the category of 'what if' disaster films, but the 'if' in this case is exceptionally large. The narrative is simple and somewhat predictable, playing out like a dramatized warning about climate change.In conclusion, while ""The Day After Tomorrow"" isn't a cinematic masterpiece, it doesn't entirely feel like a waste of time either. It's a film that can be enjoyed for what it is - a somewhat cheesy, speculative take on a climate-induced apocalypse, buoyed by a strong performance from Jake Gyllenhaal.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Visual Trip down clichéd lane,"To be perfectly honest the two things that first went through my head after seeing this movie and was allowed to think again is that director Roland Emmerich must really hold a grudge against New York, being that this is, I believe, 3rd movie destroying the city (previous ones being Independence Day and Godzilla) and the other is that he really enjoys bringing broken families together again as hes done that in several of the movies that he has written/directed. Now as for Day After Tomorrow, the best advice that i can give a person is to go out to dinner, have a big meal, a few drinks, then come see it. Now that you have been able to suspend any rational thought and just focus on the special effects you will at least fool yourself into thinking that you are seeing a good, suspenseful movie even if its not the case. The acting was clichéd, the story clichéd, but the special effects were truly remarkable and honestly i would recommend seeing it on a big screen just to truly experience it.its a fun/campy movie with very cool special effects but weighed down by so many clichés (many of which he helped establish) that it makes it a bit harder to sit back and just enjoy.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

It is really a terrible movie. However, it is one of those films you can watch again and again as the action begins almost immediately. You don't have to sit through a lot of talk or unnecessary explanations.

In 2008, I saw two other movies from Emmerich, which were ""The Patriot"" and ""10,000 BC"", and couldn't say much positive about either of those. Before finally watching ""The Day After Tomorrow"" (which came in between those other two), I knew it wasn't generally regarded as a masterpiece, but then I found that it wasn't so bad.Jack Hall is a paleoclimatologist who is in Antarctica with two colleagues, drilling ice cores, when a chunk of ice the size of Rhode Island breaks off! After this expedition, he speaks at a United Nations conference about this evidence of global warming, and how it could lead to an ice age in around 100 to 1000 years if pollution continues, but his theory is dismissed. However, after this, significant drops in temperature are soon discovered in different parts of the world, and more than one weather-related disaster takes place! It turns out that Jack's theory was correct, only it is happening a LOT sooner than he imagined! The paleoclimatologist's son, Sam, has gone to New York with some friends to participate in a scholastic competition. He finds himself stuck in the city as it floods and then freezes over! Risking his life, Jack bravely sets out with two colleagues to try and get to New York to rescue his son!This film begins with the Antarctic expedition, and this part can be a little shaky, but it does get pretty exciting when the ice breaks. There are some fairly dull parts of the film, and while I watched it, it sometimes felt like I had seen it before. Yes, it does have its share of clichés, which it has often been criticized for. I think I had previously seen movies with characters a lot like the ones here (or at least some of them) facing natural disasters, and these weren't the only familiar elements I found. However, I eventually found that ""The Day After Tomorrow"" becomes very adrenaline-inducing, and is basically like that for the remainder of the film, with the New York flood, Sam Hall trying to talk to his father on the phone as the flood waters in the building rise, among other things Sam, his friends, and others experience while stuck in the city. Jack on his very rough trip to New York to save his son also leads to a lot of excitement, and viewers could easily admire this character for what he does. There may not be too many cast highlights, but Dennis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhaal stand out as the father and son respectively, and Ian Holm is also good as Professor Terry Rapson. I also can't forget to mention how great the visuals can be!Not only has this particular sci-fi action movie been criticized in terms of quality, it has also been criticized for being very scientifically inaccurate. I'm no scientist, but I can certainly believe that this movie is extremely inaccurate, even absurd, in that regard. I've learned a lot about pollution in my life, but if ""The Day After Tomorrow"" was trying to make me worry about it more, it failed. However, if it also tries to entertain, well, it clearly has failed at that to a lot of people, but not to me. It's certainly not the most amazing film ever made, nor is it the most original, but despite all the criticism, I personally think most of this polarizing Roland Emmerich film is pretty good, even if many people might wonder how I could possibly think that. So, I certainly don't recommend you watch this movie expecting it to be an amazing adventure like you've never seen before, but if you're a sucker for adrenaline-pumping action, like me, then you MIGHT find enough of that here to make it worthwhile.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Theory not sound,"Although the theory used in the movie as to the reasons why the climate changed so dramatically is feasible, there are many holes in the theory. No scientific explanation was given as to why it all happened so quickly...or indeed at all. OK so the planet warmed, the ice Shelf melted mixing fresh water with salt, disrupting Atlantic currents...then what? why this change so quickly? Then the theory rejoins with winds tunneling air from the Ionisphere..OK fair enough The current change to the wild weather was not explained properly.On the ship when finding medication.... good scene and the most gripping with the computer generated wolves....but where did the touches come from all of a sudden?Surely with such huge global weather events there would be some effect to the southern hemisphere too....during such extremities with the disaster well into effect...radio station and television reporters are staying in there studios?? while every other person is running and panicking??? Kinda reminded me of saving Private Ryan...Was it only the Americans in WW2? As was the case with this..Other than that i gave it a 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great apocalyptic fun,"Had great fun watching this apocalyptic movie. Includes likable characters that make good decisions, US centricism and drama (including dramatic shots of the statue of liberty and UA flags freezing over) and I wasn't bored for a second. The people running away from the cold (?) when buildings are freezing over and tsunami-like waves isn't at all realistic, but that's not what this movie is about. It gave me a good laugh.

Not quite top notch...,"The Day After Tomorrow is overflowing with brilliant special effects, epic scenes of death and destruction, a meaty subject matter and a famous cast and director. Could anything be better for this film? Well, the answer is... yes. The Day After Tomorrow was good, by all standards. But it really is just another big budget Hollywood blockbuster, and won't be changing any environmental policies anytime soon. The film was very predictable from start to finish - it would have worked better had it been more realistic, but there's always got to be heroes and glory, hasn't there? The character development may have been shoddy and non-existent, but at least the people we followed felt like real people rather than a faceless mass thrown into a CGI-filled world to be put in danger and narrowly avoid death. And to be fair, this film was never boring. We actually had an idea of the struggles our main characters went through - even if they all just seemed to merely pass by before our eyes. The special effects are breathtaking and the action is top-notch - Roland Emmerich has created a film worthy to be called a hit. This film probably will have you thinking - could this happen to us one day soon? But with the constant sentimentality running throughout the film and unrealistic narrow brushes with death, it's hard to say this film is a realistic depiction of a possibly destructive nearby future. Though to be honest, this really is just another popcorn movie. And teenagers will love it. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Day After Tomorrow,"""Jack Hall"" (Dennis Quaid) is the somewhat discredited scientist who warns of impending disaster when the mother of all ice storms gathers - reducing temperatures to well below freezing and causing huge tsunami waves and heavy snows to devastate civilisation. Adding to the poor man's woes is his son ""Sam"" (Jake Gyllenhaal) stranded in New York. It's a bit heavy on the CGI and, certainly, the plot is pretty well worn and far-fetched but it's a disaster movie so I wasn't really expecting Pulitzer prize winning stuff. The young Gyllenhaal is easy enough on the eye and his adventures are marginally more interesting than his father's perilous trek from Washington. The storyline has a certain earnestness about it that is a bit preposterous, and the concluding spiel from the US President ""Becker"" (Kenneth Welsh) is a bit naff. Luckily, it isn't in the least romantic - it's a straightforward and entertaining disaster movie that though far, far too long, is just about worth a watch...",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Hollywood-ised climate change,"Yes, this film is quite sensationalistic and turns the concept of climate change into a rather simplistic Hollywood blockbuster. Oh well, you get what you expect!

Plain terrible,"(some spoilers may be ahead) For a movie that's listed #39th in the international box office (at time of writing), I thought this movie was plain terrible. It started off with an exciting storyline, but nothing in this movie lived up to it. The worst part was the acting and clichéd moments. The part where Dennis Quaid was trying to save his friend from falling through the ice, it was too dam cheesy, total lack of creativity, too predictable, poor attempt to create drama. This movie tries too hard to be an movie of epic proportions, but it never came close. The focus on the movie should have been lots of mother nature disasters happening all over the world. But too much time was wasted on the characters relationships, the unnecessary dragged out dramas. It's just that these sort of movies you couldn't care less about them, you paid to see earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, stuff like that. I guess we did get a fair chunk of it, but I guess I wasn't satisfied.Good parts of the movie? Not a lot, it had a cute girl in it. That Jake Gayenhael had a wee little love interest in her, I liked that part.Special effects? Well I'll admit they were pretty good. Cool tidal wave effects, cool tornado effects too. Would have like to have seen more buildings and stuff get blown away, but hey you gotta stick to your CGI budget these days.Overall its an OK movie to waste your time on, but its not something you'd go into expecting excellent things out of.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Comedy Blockbuster of the Summer,"I enjoyed the movie immensely. Sadly, I enjoyed the movie as a comedy. This should say something about the quality of the movie.From the cliché plot devices, the horrible science, the plot holes that you could drive a truck through, and the horrible dialog, this movie is perfect comedy material. You and your friends can enjoy the movie by making fun of almost everything.You might watch the movie and wonder such things as ""Why did they just show that character getting her leg cut? I bet it will threaten her life somehow later in the movie."" or ""Wolves escaped? I bet those wolves will hunt down the main characters in the terrible blizzard of epic scale."" I wondered these things and laughed them off, believing that no one would ever use such clichés. I was ***WRONG***. My wrongness provided much enjoyment for both me and my friends.The science. Yeah... wow. A ice age in six days. I thought the Core had bad science, but this takes the cake.I give it a 10/10. Greatest comedy this year. It's sad that it was unintentional.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A tale of two halves.,"Once again Roland Emmerich has made a film of two halves just like ID4 and God(awful)zilla. In this film the first half of the movie is great - lots of effects and drama - real edge-of-your-seat stuff and the movie is well paced.Then New York gets whacked and the film goes downhill into I-really-couldn't-care-less territory. To me it seems like Mr.Emmerich is very good at depicting chaos and destruction of cities but seems to lack a lot of skill when it comes to involving real live, talking humans into the story.I'm sure this film will make buckets of cash and I'm sure Mr.Emmerich will make another disaster(ous) movie again, but at least that wont be for a couple of years...phew!",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A Good Flick That Could've Been Great!,"Well I have to say that I enjoyed The Day After Tomorrow, but it could have been so much better.  Initially the movie has a grand international scope and almost takes on the memorable ""bigness"" of Independence Day.Although it starts off as a climatic shift for mother earth, it really ends up being a dramatic shift in priorities for Dennis Quaid's character and his relationship to his son.The movie has a few warm moments, some bone chilling moments, and a few what if, moments.  Especially the impact of a climate change on the northern hemisphere and its impact on the 3rd World.Overall, a good flick to go see and unwind at but not a great flick to see again.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An utmost entertaining modern disaster movie with a very important message,"The Day After Tomorrow tells the story about a select few who has to endure and fight for their lives to survive a new ice age brought on by global warming. What this film has going for it the most are the special effects which are absolutely mind-blowing a majority of the time, not to mention how stunningly believable they are.The film also offers a good story about courage and the importance of working together to overcome obstacles, told with the genre conventions of a good disaster movie. It feels like a good change that for once the main characters are everyday people (a homeless man, young students etc), while the people with the supposed power like the president and the Dick Cheney-lookalike vice president are little more than fools. The forces of the weather are a little bit too much even for the president of the United States, who can do nothing real when faced with the reality that he has ultimately helped to create.The greatest achievement of this film is however Roland Emmerich's way of putting the very important message of the environmental issue, into this high-concept film without doing it too obvious. Still, perhaps it's a bit too much in your face since I believe this is the main reason why people don't like this film. The average moviegoer doesn't want to be told that their lovely cars that they drive around in every day can cause a big disaster. People don't want to be told to be aware of the environment in any way, and just go about their business consuming the way they are used to.My only gripes with the film: 1. Jake Gyllenhaal doesn't look even one tiny bit like a 17-year old. 2. The wolves look fake. 3. The three Scottish persons saying ""For England!"".",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
i liked it,"I saw this film on the big screen and got it on DVD and i must say i like it. Just a couple of problems i had with it though.1, its too American. It seems like the film makers were only concern with the effects the weather was having in the USA and nowhere else in the Northern Hemisphere. One piece the President said (must admit he was the weakest president I've ever seen in a film) ""What about the people in the north?"" meaning the northern USA. Hang on? Wouldn't the entire north be trying to help each other out????? Instead of saying What about the North? How about: What about the North and the Canadians? Seems like they didn't matter. Felt like asking the president. What are the Canadians doing? laying back and having a fag? With this also, once the bit in Scotland was over, that was it for the rest of the northern hemisphere.2, second point. I have put this on Titanic as well as its relevant.

Has anyone noticed this?,"Quote:""Not too long ago I adapted a novel into a screenplay. I had to start from scratch. It was a disaster book about a meteorologist who discovers a new ice age approaching. No one believes him, of course, and when the weather changes it's too late. The new ice age begins. The meteorologist and a group of other scientists are sent to examine the glacier in Iceland, but the ship freezes in the ice. The novel ends with the main character freezing to death.""That was the book. A disaster story of 650 pages that's a downer.""I decided to keep the main character, but I wanted to place him in emotional conflict for more dramatic value. So I made him a politically outspoken professor, who was being considered for tenure at NYU. His 'irresponsible' statements about the impending ice age could possibly jeopardize his appointment.""Then I had to figure out what to do about the story. I needed to change the ending into an 'upbeat' or positive one. I wanted them to live, not die in the frozen ice. So I had to construct new elements BASED on the novel. I began knowing I wanted an exciting opening. I went through the book and on page 287 found the main character traveling to the glacier in Iceland to measure glacial movement. I decided to open there, on the vast ice plain. A visual element. As they descend deep into the heart of the glacier an earthquake occurs, causing an avalanche. They barely make it out alive. It's a strong, visual sequence and sets up the story appropriately.""When the professor returns to New York and presents his findings to his superiors, they don't believe him. The first blizzard of the year, the warning, then becomes the plot point at the end of Act I... The shape of things to come.""The second act was another problem. I reduced most of the action to three major sequences: one, the main character organizes a world-wide network of scientists to try and solve the problem; two, New York City freezes; and three, the people finally accept the truth and try to formulate a plan. I strung these sequences together with incidents from the book, knowing I had to avoid all disaster-movie clichés; there was no market for disaster movies at the time. As I mentioned, the original ending didn't work and had to be changed. I ended up with a futuristic survival story.""The above quote is from the 1982 edition of the 1979 book SCREENPLAY, by Syd Field.It has been reproduced without permission.Like this movie.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

It's terribly hackneyed stuff, but it's almost like the movie is aware of how bad it is, and deliberately plays on that. So instead, it actually becomes pretty interesting seeing where the hell it's going to turn next. My favorite part: the irrelevancy of the ravenous wolves was a masterstroke. Totally random, but such fun. Also, the fact that the folks in Europe (Ian Holm and his crew) kind of just... well, disappeared - died maybe? Who knows? It wasn't explained, or did I miss something?

Solid Doomsday,"The Day After Tomorrow is a solid doomsday film. The premise is interesting, the cast has some bright spots and there is good tension throughout. Some of the more ""thrilling"" moments felt a bit forced (i.e., the wolves, the 10 degree drop per second, etc.), but for the most part the film felt like something that could actually happen.My biggest gripe with this film is the plot structure. It takes a long time for anything to happen and then everything is wrapped up in a tight 20-30 minutes. I would have liked to see a little more closure and development of the side characters (the mom's side plot is pretty pointless).

The surviving population of the USA become refugees in third world nations throughout the world. The president apologizes for his foolish short sighted anti-environmental policies that lead this catastrophe. This is not some petty disaster of a town being invaded by killer bees.The magical ability of the leads to survive in temperatures that freeze everyone else solid in seconds is never explained. However, I am good at suspension of disbelief, and the film kept me on the edge of my seat.Watching the New York skyscrapers turn into Popsicles is awe-inspiring and beautiful.

Some things ...,"I've always had issues with action films. I don't have many in my DVD collection and I can count the ones I genuinely love on ten fingers. And when I look at the action films I have enjoyed, it tends to be because I like the characters or the depth of the dialogue. The really clever thing about Jurassic Park, and why it still works even all these years after the shock of seeing dinosaurs has dissipated is because the moments between those victims work so well. And so it proves with The Day After Tomorrow. Magazine after magazine has focused on the special effects wizardry and the creation of the weather. These for me were the weakest moments.The real strength of the piece is the reaction of the people to the impending doom and their compensation of what transpires. Yes, it's fairly interesting to see the tornadoes hammer through LA, and for the blizzards and tidle waves to take hold of New York. But frankly, nothing seen here is any more astounding than Twister or Deep Impact (other than the fact that they mount on top of one another). My favourite scenes don't include the weather, except as the peripheral cause. Good example: in an unusual twist large sections of the first act of the film take place in a small hut in the highlands of Scotland as three Englishman are the first to notice the unusual readings which would lead to Earth's near destruction and their efforts to get the message out. Unusually for an American film, it doesn't seem forced -- the dialogue feels local -- and without the rest of the theatrics it could be some BBC Two Horizon drama.Similar moments happen on the other side of the pond as the effects of the storm take hold. Again, I'd take issue with the naysayers who've been poo-pooing the script. Granted there is a moment with wolves which puts the infamous 24 Cougar incident to shame, but again the real drama comes from the isolation of the characters and also the realisation of what's important to mankind and its civilization. Watch out for a major politician considering whether North America should be looked at as a giant triage unit and when a librarian makes a passionate plea about which sections of his need to be saved. Speaking of which -- if this thing is so lame brained, how come there's a fabulous moment when two minor characters debate the importance of whether Neizche's work should be burnt which is right on the nose?So its intelligent, educational, the direction is fascinating and the acting is superb producing a well rounded action drama. But, now that New York has been destroyed by aliens, freak weather conditions and Godzilla, which other Sim City disasters are Emmerich and Devlin going to film next? A remake of Earthquake?",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Thrilling Climate Disaster Spectacle,"The Day After Tomorrow is a visually stunning and emotionally gripping disaster film that delivers an intense, edge of your seat experience. While the science behind the movie may not hold up to rigorous scrutiny, its execution as a high-stakes thriller is undeniably entertaining.The film follows climatologist Jack Hall, who predicts a catastrophic shift in the planet's climate. His worst fears come true when a series of extreme weather events-massive tornadoes, tsunamis, and an abrupt Ice Age-sweep across the globe. At the heart of the story is Jack's desperate journey to rescue his son, Sam, who is trapped in a frozen New York City with his friends.What makes The Day After Tomorrow so engaging is its breathtaking special effects. The film's depiction of nature's fury, from a towering tidal wave crashing into Manhattan to the eerie silence of a snow-covered metropolis, remains impressive even by today's standards. The tension never lets up, and the father-son dynamic adds a layer of emotional depth amidst the chaos.Although the movie takes creative liberties with climate science, it successfully raises awareness about global warming in a way that's accessible and dramatic. The pacing is swift, the stakes are high, and the action sequences are thrilling.If you're looking for a disaster film that balances spectacle with heart, The Day After Tomorrow is a must-watch.

And as for that modest rise in sea levels they're predicting, lets make it a colossal tidal wave slamming into New York.Looking good! So what else do we need? Hey, how about a new ice age. One that descends right across the northern hemisphere in about five minutes flat. And how about vast super-storms that freeze people solid in a couple of seconds! And huge tornadoes smashing up LA! Looking real good!Now, I guess we need a few characters, and some sort of a script, don't you think? Hey, do we still have those chimps on contract? You know the ones with the typewriters. Yeah, give them an infinite amount of time and they'll type out the complete works of Shakespeare, or something like that.No, we don't have an infinite amount of time. Just go with their first draft. It'll be fine. Long as we stick enough CGI effects in there, nobody's going to care one way or another.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Review,I don't understand all the people who don't like the film because it is illogical or there are unreal coincidences or something like that. It's a disaster and a science-fiction movie and it's a really great movie at all.

"Entertaining, if somewhat empty","Saw this yesterday at a media screening over here. It was almost as notable for the laughter breaking out at completely inappropriate times as for the action on screen.The idea of the world being embraced in a new ice age due to global warming is an interesting one, a pity then it seems that global disasters only ever happen in the USA. Add a pinch of mawkish feel-good characters and setups (the sick kid in hospital, the self sacrificing doctor) and a dash of over the top movie physics, and the result is a typical Hollywood blockbuster with little bearing on reality.Not to say it wasn't thoroughly enjoyable mind you, just that if you go in expecting anything other than a heavy hand teaching that climate change = bad, you are sorely mistaken.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Special effects don't replace a good story,"While the special effects of this movie are excellent, and used in a way that does not detract from the story, the problem is there is no story to be distracted from.Wooden acting coupled with predictable plodding dialog made me laugh out loud at parts where I should have felt empathy for the characters. Too bad, because the subject is interesting and important, and done right this movie could have helped us think about our planet in a meaningful way.Note to Hollywood: It's ALWAYS about the story!I give this movie 3/10.

Best Emmerich movie I've seen!,"I enjoyed Independence Day and Godzilla - the only Emmerich movies I have seen. This one was even better.We have seen the trailers I don't know how many times and I was afraid that there would be nothing more to see in the actual film. I was wrong. There is a lot more.The suspense builds up nicely, the special effects are great and what you see is truly spectacular.In movies like this it often happens that the effects become the main thing and that the characters aren't developed. This was not the case with this movie. We get to know main characters and we care about them.Another positive point about Day After Tomorrow: it has no violence, no sex and no foul language and is still very enjoyable.I have a feeling this is going to be a big box office hit.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Special,"It's scary how much of this isn't actually far from what can happen. The effects in the movie is amazing and the start is awesome made. But that's about it that's good about it. The movie drags on for too long and gets boring. And a movie isn't rarely good just because of amazing effects. Happy endings is okay now and then, but here? It could be more realistic not having all of the main characters surviving. Kinda ruined by the American clichés.The acting is okay, but five of the stars is given to the start.

Questioning the Science!,"I'll keep this short as all the long comments have covered all the positive or negative aspects to this film already. I was enjoying the science and special effects in the early part of the movie, when to my dismay I noticed the large presentation screen at the multinational weather conference. Quaid was giving a detailed analysis of the possible effects of global warming, explaining how the gulf stream kept the northern countries warm. He explained how global warming could stop this gulf stream or as is known ""turn off the tap"" of the gulf stream. Meanwhile however, in full view of all concerned, the visual display had the gulf stream going in reverse! My understanding of the global effect is that it might stop the flow but not reverse it. Either way it looked ridiculous as it never was explained that the reverse process was being discussed. It looked like someone got the graphics wrong and nobody was aware of the ""mistake"".Apart from this, and some other meteorological anomalies the film is reasonably enjoyable.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

All the parts that were meant to be funny were horribly unfunny, while I was laughing during all the ""serious"" parts because they were all so...cliché.

"Ah, back to those thrilling days of...","...the 1970s, when we saw such big-budget blockbuster disaster movies as ""Earthquake"" (in SENSURROUND!) and Irwin Allen's ""The Poseidon Adventure"" and ""The Towering Inferno"".  I have to admit, I loved these movies as a kid, though ""Poseidon"" is likely the only one that even remotely holds up.Even so, when I saw the ads for ""The Day After Tomorrow"", I felt a long-forgotten chill of excitement run through me.  The disaster movie is BACK, baby!This is not really a very good movie, but I liked it anyway, and give it a marginal recommendation.  The script is cliched (right down to the ""we have to do something before it's too late!"" dialogue), parts of the story downright asinine (you just KNEW those wolves were going to show up at an inconvenient time), but the effects were incredible, and some of the story lines turned out to be fairly interesting.  That I've always liked Dennis Quaid, and I'm happy to see him find work, only adds to my enjoyment.Normally, I'd say wait for video.  However, some of the disaster sequences are utterly spectacular and truly demand big-screen viewing.  In particular, the scene where the tidal wave first washes around the Statue of Liberty and into Manhattan is breathtaking.By the way, as silly as much of this is, there are a few grains of intelligence behind this story.  I doubt the science is meant to be taken seriously at all, but the film does leave us with the message that if we continue to abuse the environment, it may turn on us in drastic and unexpected ways.  And I liked the irony that Americans are forced to flee south to Mexico, suggesting that perhaps it's worth improving relations with the developing world because we never know when we'll need them...Call it 7/10, for spectacular special effects and some nostalgia.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Very Average,"This flick falls into the catastrophe category which has been repeated over and over as the end of mankind. Armageddon, Independence day etc. This film for me delivered what I expected it to.Yes, it has fantastic special effects but what big budget movie doesn't these days?. It's far too slow moving for my liking and without the special effects, I very much doubt whether I would have got to the end credits. At least Independence Day didn't rely solely on effects, it had characters in it with attitude (Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum & Bill Pullman) as very important back-up to keep the prospective audience interested whilst they were not seeing mass destruction.Rating 6/10 Disappointing.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good,"This is entertaining, though difficult to believe. Basically, the earth's climate changes abruptly (like nearly overnight). While I believe that global warming is a reality, this is too much. However, if you can ignore the fantastic, the film is OK. The acting is adequate, although no one particularly shines. The special effects are pretty decent, although the sudden freezing of everything isn't terribly good. The story is pretty well written, and should be a warning to everyone that our climate is changing because of our insatiable demand for fossil fuels. It's definitely an ecological wake-up call. I almost bought this but decided to rent instead and am glad I did. It's not a ""keeper"" for me. Others will really enjoy it more than I did.

The Reel After the First One....,"....is when it's time to give up on this flash in the pan. Much like another 2004 entry, Van Helsing, the first 30 minutes or so are breath-takingly good and the rest is just filler. Here the disappointment is more intense if only because the initial concept is so promising. Weather expert Quaid determines that global warming is going to trigger cataclysmic (and I mean Act of God cataclysmic) weather changes. His warnings go unheeded until most of North America is a skating rink. Almost all of the fascinating special effects are loaded up front. The rest of the movie (Quaid walking to Manhattan to search for his son) seems like a (bad) made-for-TV-movie - hokey, unbelievable, disjointed and uninteresting.

Of course, there are many more and much better films about human reactions in front of incredible and terrible events, but this one is very exciting. You'll not get disappointed if you go and see this movie expecting spectacular scenes (theeye of the storm is just A-MA-ZING!!), you'll not be disappointed if you wait for some reflexion about our society.

Should have gone straight to video,"I am ALWAYS leary of any movie that tries to beat me over the head with the political views of the director/producer/writer.

The fact is, the earth has gone through at least 2 ice ages, both LONG before man had cars and manufacturing plants. Both these ice ages took YEARS to effect the environment.....it is impossible for the changes to take place so quickly.The thing that makes disaster movies work, is the basis of ""This could really happen.""

What is happening now! - telescoped in 2004.,"There is a recent news article with a title remarking how much polar vortex hit Chicago looks like New York in The Day After Tomorrow.And thanks to global warming and glacial melting the AMOC - worldwide ocean current conveyor belt which includes the Atlantic Current warming Northern Europe - is indeed weakening and could even stop.The ridicule of the film was basically that it telescoped events, not that those wouldn't happen.And it's happening with increasing violence and suddenness, as depicted in the film.All the actors are excellent in this, and Dennis Quaid perfectly gets across the urgency of our situation.And while a major theme of the film is of course environmental/climatological science, the most compelling theme is caring for our children - their future.This film has gotten 1,362 reviews! Which shows its power and effectiveness attempting to awaken humanity to our necessity to ACT NOW.The analogy of the Ukraine War being fools fighting over deck chairs on our sinking/submerging Titanic-environment cannot be ignored.Our current Western foreign policy of confrontation and war (with the East) is blocking the international re-unification and action which are our (children's) only hope for survival.Lou Coatney.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A good apocalypse to all human beings,"Especially American! As said by the ""U.S. President"" in the movie, we have deprived too much from the earth.  We get revenge!

But this was solved too simply by an exemption of national debts announced by the ""President"".  But saying them to be so generous could be true.  They could add a condition: no US governmental officials should cross the border!  But this might make the plot too lengthy. Hmm... I said back in 1996, maybe.

"Enjoyable enough, but don't look between the cracks or you'll see the sellotape holding it all together.","As a self-avowed fan of apocalyptic scenarios either in book or film, I couldn't help but enjoy this movie, even though I felt more than a little let down by it.If you're looking for effects, then this film has plenty. But if you fancy a decent human interest story to go along with the destruction then I fear you'll be disappointed. The human side of the story is rather basic. A love interest angle for Sam Hall (Gyllenhall) and the obligatory struggle to survive. A father's love for his son and some hokum about a kid with cancer. Bland stuff.Whilst the effects are worth the money, the plot really isn't. As I mentioned before, I still enjoyed the film, but it was sadly lacking any real depth or characterisation. Additionally, rather obvious plot developments (at least I think so) were ignored in favour of cheap thrill alternatives. For instance, in a life or death struggle for survival I think rather more people would throw off the yoke of civilization and use the situation to their advantage. I'm not talking looters here, either. But in a group such as portrayed in the movie, it might have been nice to see one person with his own ideas (however dark) emerge - a human vs. human conflict. Instead, the only threat our group faces (apart from the weather) is from a pack of wolves that, having escaped from a zoo, apparently turn immediately into a pack of ravening man-eaters. Ho hum.Another nonsense concerns the girl who cuts her foot and gets an infection as a result. Not once during the steady onset of blood poisoning does she examine the cut or question why she doesn't feel too good. Duh!And whilst I'm ranting, how many people would actually follow a traffic cop out into the frozen, icy outdoors, wearing nothing more protective than their everyday casual attire, on the basis of the fact that he was an official and told them they had to ""head south"". Absolute bollocks! No-one is that dumb. Even children aren't that trusting.Another annoyance was the insistence of the director that there wouldn't be a Hollywood ""happy ending"". I'm not sure what I expected after I read this comment, but I doubt it was the evacuation of half of America to relative safety. That doesn't sound too apocalyptic to me. Nor did I expect to see the NY survivors thronging the rooftops of skyscrapers in their hundreds waiting for rescue by squadrons of helicopters who clearly had nothing better to do than fly around abandoned cities. How these people survived, when our heroic group only just managed it, is not explained.There was a lot (and I mean mounds!) of juvenile writing that went into this script and a lot of final-scenes feel-good nonsense. Too much ""man will prevail"" rubbish from a director who promised us something better, then didn't deliver.There are some nice visuals and some good ideas for the use of them, but the story is rather lame and best ignored by the viewer. If you do that, then it'll entertain reasonably well. But if you start thinking about the plot.......ewww!I'll no doubt watch this again when it comes on TV but, having noticed the cracks, it's hard not to look into them and see the whole thing for what it really is - an excuse to use CGI a lot.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

It's very preachy and can at times make you wince (did I mention the down-and-out black NY street bum teaching the silver-spoon-in-mouthed white rich kid how to insulate himself with paper?).The CG is almost flawless and I think that's what people really see these movies for, 2 hours of boom, crash, snap, crackle and pop.We need a break from depressing films like 21 Grams and House of Sand and Fog every now and again and it's good to see a movie without $30M USD per movie A-List actors.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I shuddered and shivered,"9.5 stars.My primary factor in a rating system is entertainment, entertainment, and more entertainment. Is 'The Day After Tomorrow' a particularly entertaining movie? It's difficult to answer that in the usual terms. It's so interesting, and full of amazing performances. I've seen it probably 8 times, and never tire of it. The combination of Gyllenhaal, Quaid, Rossum, Ward, the quintessential Ian Holm, goes unmatched compared to all apocalyptic stories (even beats 'World War Z', which I love).We can compare movies just by scrolling down, you'll see ""More like this"", featuring ""2012"", a brilliant and action packed film, doesn't touch this one for the authentic cinematography and extinction feeling, it's too eruption and explosion oriented, has a cheapness to it and is not subtle enough. I can say the same about 'San Andreas', 'Armageddon', not so much with 'Deep Impact', which I feel gives a more authentic feeling depicting global devastation by asteroid induced tsunamis.This is the best extinction-esque film ever made in my opinion. It's about the eerie and sobering possibility of an ice-age, caused by global warming. Sounds ironic, but it's not. The frozen in an instant mammoths in the tundra, that stuff is for real.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A (guilty) pleasure to watch,"I shouldn't like this movie.  It has a premise based on something completely unscientific, it relies too much on cliche action sequences, and the story itself is not that strong.  Yet I still couldn't help but like The Day After Tomorrow.I personally am not a huge fan of natural disaster flicks.  As of right now the asteroid movie Deep Impact is my favourite of the genre, but The Day After Tomorrow is firmly in second.  Like pretty much all of Roland Emmerich's movies, the number one reason to go see this movie is for the special effects.  The first half of the movie is filled with fantastic scenes of destruction, such as massive tidal waves, blinding snow storms, and seeing all of North America and its major cities encased in ice.  It is quite simply a smorgasbord of sweetness for the eyes, and it had me on the edge of my seat...until the second half hit.The second half of the movie is much slower than the first half, and focuses on climatologist Jack Hall's (played by Dennis Quaid) efforts to rescue his son Sam Hall (played by Jake Gyllenhaal), who's trapped in New York City. The acting is on the whole not bad, with Jake Gyllenhaal being the stand out in the movie.  It's interesting to see how everybody in the movie acted when confronted with a life or death situation.  But, personally I wanted to see more scenes of destruction in the second half, and I can't help but feel a little gypped when they pretty much stopped.Overall, The Day After Tomorrow is first and foremost a disaster pic, and if you come to movie looking for nothing beyond some great eye candy, you probably won't be disappointed.  Just don't go expecting too much more than that though.I give this movie 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Movie message in 'The Day After Tomorrow' is mostly hot air,"June 7, 2004Unable to develop a coherent political ideology to oppose President George W. Bush, the anti-Bush cabal has turned to humor and Hollywood. The CBS Evening News borrows jokes from late-night comedy shows to jab at Bush every Friday evening, and we have just been treated to big fanfare about a new anti-Bush movie.The thesis of ""The Day After Tomorrow"" is that the Bush administration has failed to protect us from global warming. According to this theory, global warming caused by carbon dioxide emissions will melt the ice at the North Pole, which will then warm the Atlantic current, making Northern Hemisphere temperatures drop precipitously and bring about a new ice age within hours.New York City is hit by a huge tidal wave and a catastrophic ice storm. It's all pretty grim; only the wolves that escape from the Bronx Zoo are having a good time.This climate disaster might come tomorrow, 100 years from now or in 1,000 years.Regardless, it's all the fault of our insensitive, out-of-touch president who refuses to ratify former Vice President Al Gore's favorite treaty, the Kyoto Protocol. In the movie, the president meets the fate he deserves along with everyone else in Washington, D.C.The real bad guy is the vice president, a look-alike for Dick Cheney, who puts budgetary constraints ahead of incurring the gigantic costs of environmental regulations demanded by global-warming fear mongers. He is made to eat crow at the end of the movie, publicly confessing the error of his ways and thanking the Third World for accepting the mass migration of U.S. citizens fleeing south to escape the ice.We must credit the movie producers for making the audience laugh out loud at the scene of Americans wading across the Rio Grande to cross our southern border illegally, begging for entry into Mexico to escape the cold. At first, Mexico tries to seal the border against the influx of Americans, but our president's cozy relationship with the Mexican president enables them to work out a deal: the United States forgives all Mexico's debts and Mexico graciously allows Americans to enter Mexico.The hero of the movie, the scientist who predicted it all, is a man of unbelievable endurance. He warns his son to stay inside the New York Public Library because, if he ventures outside, he will freeze to death within minutes. But the father somehow walks through ice and blizzard all the way from Philadelphia to New York to join him.The son and friends holed up in the library keep warm by burning books. The movie audience responded with lusty cheers when the volumes containing the tax code were tossed into the fireplace.We see Manhattan covered with ice up to the roof of the public library and the arms of the Statue of Liberty, as well as tornadoes in Los Angeles, ice sheets breaking up in Antarctica, hail the size of baseballs in Japan, and snow in India. The special effects of ""The Day After Tomorrow"" are fun to watch, but their utter improbability defeats the propaganda message.Nevertheless, Gore, Al Franken, and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., are hoping this summer disaster flick will make Americans take global warming seriously and turn it into a presidential campaign issue. MoveOn.org and the National Resources Defense Council are distributing leaflets at theaters to explain the message to moviegoers.Environmental groups are urging Americans to do their part to save the environment by riding bicycles to the movie theater. I didn't notice any movie stars giving up their SUVs or Gore riding his bike; it is President Bush who has made news by bicycle riding.Global warming isn't science; it's leftist propaganda to promote global regulation of our economy. If the predictions of the movie were true, it is obvious that absolutely nothing we could do - even abandoning every automobile in America - would make any difference.In April, a team from Harvard University concluded the most comprehensive study ever made of global temperature over the last 1,000 years. The team reported that the world was much warmer during the Middle Ages, between A.D. 800 and 1,300, than it is today.Bush is in good company in rejecting Kyoto. The U.S. Senate voted 95-0 in 1997 against Kyoto because it would cost jobs and drastically reduce the standard of living in the United States, while exempting most other countries from its regulations. The various international conferences on global warming have produced mostly hot air, and Russia gave Kyoto the kiss of death last year when Russian President Vladimir Putin pulled out, saying that Kyoto would stunt his country's economic growth.Phyllis Schlafly",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The special effects, what had originally caught my eye, were outstanding. And even the story, though not THAT prominent as compared to the fact that there are lots of tornados and New York gets Washed out with a giant tidal wave, still manages to work very well and get you caught up in the lives of these people. I actually found myself, silently, calling out for people to be saved and not to do certain things. I became caught up in the lives of these people, and not many movies can do that to me.I hear many complaining about the fact that this is so unbelievable, and that it could never happen in the time frame presented. Well, what were they expecting... we were introduced to Jack Hall and Co. and then we skip to 10 000 years from now and his great great great great great great and so on grandchildren? No, I don't think that would have kept anyone in their seats to watch the end. The point of this movie was to be outlandish, and extreme. Even the characters in the movie cannot believe that it is happening as soon as it is. Even the director stated that timeline of events that this movie occurs would NEVER happen. It's a crazy idea that in 7 days all this could happen, but it's for entertainment value!I personally, recommend this movie highly. But don't be quick to judge it just because, yes, everything happens more than slightly quickly. This movie has a good story and a scary message.

I personally rated it a 6 because it was more good than it was bad,I'm just not saying it's my all-time favorite or nothing like that.The special effects where very good on the f-5 tornado's and especially on the satillite view of the hurricanes. My favorite part of this movie,was when I saw the statue of liberty frozen (you don't get to see that every day).

Cool.  Icy chill.,"I saw this film ages ago and thought that it was very good, not only due to its great effects, but its storyline and its situations, jokes included. The story may be fairly boilerplate, but the effects and acting make up for that in a pinch. It is about the next natural disaster striking every corner of the Earth and the movements put forth by many to try to do something to that end. While the situations displayed in the film are applicable only loosely to real life, that makes all the less difference, as the film is ultimately good. This film has good situations for some and is ultimately good for a rainy day...no pun intended.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Oops....their doing it again.,"Dennis Quad is a climatologist smack dab in the worst scenario to strike the world in 10,000 yearsanother Hollywood special effects bonanza.The polar ice cap begins to melt thanks to the greenhouse effect, disrupting the Atlantic current and severely alters the climate. Massive tornadoes hit California, flooding and tidal waves in Manhattan, ice storms in Japan and three super-storms that closely resemble hurricanes appear with such speed that when the storms dissipate the world will be plunged into another ice age.Roland (ID4) Emmerich strikes again with another popcorn muncher. The eye-candy this time around needed a bit more time for polishing. Some of the effects look pretty bad but don't take away too much from the disastrous fun. But an eerie echo settles down in light of the recent tsunami disaster.Good mindless fun that provokes a bit of thought as you see the Hollywood sign obliterated and ships sail down New York City. Oh and there's a little father and son story too for those who like a little meat with your fat.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Boring and Dull,"I just saw this at the cinema. Sure some of the FX was good but that was in the trailer. Too much is played in tv movie style ""i'm going to get my son"". So forget the millions he might of saved on the way. Loads of Places are destroyed, yet only America is seen getting destroyed. Yawn. The acting is ok and there are a few moments of humour, this to me was Twister meets Deep Impact meets The Poseidon Adventure meets Godzilla and the last 10 minutes of On Deadly Ground where Steven Seagal gave a lecture on global warming, only this lecture lasts half of the movie. I do not go to a summer blockbuster for a lecture, or to have better movies ripped off. Disaster movies need all star cast's with suspense and characters in real peril. The young guy Jake seemed too interested in being a moody Peter Parker. Dennis Quaid is just a poor man's Harrison Ford. This is so boring and dull that i suspect the big opening it will no doubt receive, will then be blasted away by the other summer blockbusters.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Slap on your snow shoes and get burning your books—The Day After Tomorrow could be sooner than you think (huh?).,"2012 is just around the corner, which according to the Mayans spells disaster for Planet Earth; evangelical Bible-thumpers insist that The Rapture will commence on the 21st of May this very year, leaving us heathens to suffer in torment on Earth for five months before the world is finally destroyed in flames; this week Japan has suffered the fifth most violent earthquake in recorded history, leaving thousands dead from the resulting tsunami. So what the hell made me think that tonight would be a good night to watch environmental disaster flick The Day After Tomorrow?Well, what better way to hide from the horrors of reality by immersing oneself in a patently fictional disaster, a piece of glossy escapist entertainment (albeit with an important message at its heart) which at least offers a faint glimmer of hope for humanity, and where the spirit of mankind prevails against all odds? Roland Emmerich's film is the perfect antidote to the constant portents of doom and the very depressing images currently playing on my TV: in this big budget Hollywood vision of 'the day after tomorrow', the future may be bleak, but it isn't over for good; and even though the planet may be frozen, the warmth of a father's love for his son can never be extinguished. So, despite all the death and destruction, it's actually a feel-good movie—just what the doctor ordered.Plus, only in a CGI-laden disaster film like this can you see an awesome sight like a tidal wave crashing through the streets of New York before turning into a massive block of ice WITHOUT dying as a result. And that's gotta count for something.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Disaster film not overly reliant on grand SFX,"In ""The Day After Tomorrow"", Roland Emmerich delivers a film with surprising amounts of realism, given it's still signed and approved by the Master of Disaster himself. As a series of climate catastrophes lead to a new ice age, Dennis Quaid in the lead role, sets out to New York, hoping to find his son (Gyllenhaal) alive. It took me back, as the film progressed and it became evident that Emmerich was focusing more on a survival journey rather than lengthy runs from a literal apocalyptic doom; ultimately bringing some freshness to the genre of disaster movie. But don't despair, there is still plenty of big city apocalypse action.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not very good,"Where do I start? I could write several pages of continuity errors, insanities, stupidities, inaccuracies and basic logic failures, but a review should never strive to be as boring as its subject matter.Let's cut to the chase. I can not recommend this film. If you've read any of my reviews of poor films, you may remember that I reserve the rating of 1 for big-ticket Hollywood films that do more harm than good. Although I have fairly rated DAT with a 3, I should mention that it very nearly got a 1.Why can't I recommend this?1. Great deal of scientific misinformation. (I teach geology at a university, I am not making this up)2.Lacklustre screenplay showcasing special effects and a poorly developed family drama motif.3. Not very interesting characters. Nothing wrong with the performances. Quaid is particularly good, but Jake G is terribly miscast. Characters are clichés - Quaid is a martyr good guy scientist/overworked dad who is on the verge of losing his family. Gylenhaal is a gifted lovesick nerd who outsmarts his teachers. Sela Ward is the not-very understanding but well intentioned mom. Ken Welsh is an idiotic conservative politician who doesn't seem to be able to distinguish science from political debate.4. Absurd general premise (one day special delivery Heisenburg event) coupled with cliché characters (above) and under-developed emotional reactions.You don't even need to see the trailers to know what to expect from this movie. Quaid plays a scientist who is desperately trying to get the USA's political machine to understand global warming one week, and a father trying to rescue his son and a handful of survivors from a megastorm which is ushering in the destruction of the developed world in the Northern Hemisphere in the next week. Though Quaid is convincing, the rest of the cast joins the special effects in failing to make this believable. Not their fault. Nothing could be done!I am a sci fi fan and have no objection to fantasy. What I have problems with is science fantasy that pretends its something else. People are already terribly under-educated with the real practical and globally important issues that science contends with. We don't need Hollywood confusing matters even more.Blaming this mess on Roland Emmerich seems a bit over-simplified. He does some interesting stuff with cinematography and story telling (The Patriot), even in this film. I am not really sure where this film derailed for me. But with the elements discussed above, it's hard to imagine it doing otherwise.The film sports some pretty interesting special effects. If you're seeing it to watch New York get partially glaciated and to watch Dennis Quaid give a passable performance, then you have an excuse. Enjoy!",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fun disaster flick,"This is a movie in the grand ole tradition of ""Earthquake,"" ""The Towering Inferno,"" and so on. It's a big-budget disaster flick built up around a somewhat flimsy premise.It's a fun way to spend a couple of hours. Don't make the mistake of the impossibly partisan and read too much into it. Lord knows, judging a movie by how realistic it is would rule out 99% of everything that's made.As far as ""Day After Tomorrow"" is concerned, it's comforting to know that a long-lost ""disaster flick"" genre is still alive and well!",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Earth Dies,"So, we've got ourselves a big-budget disaster flick as the backdrop of a stereotypical drama and a very blunt environmental call to arms. You're going to get outraged if you went in looking for perfection, but you've read the reviews and you know this guy's previous work - you just wanna see New York crushed by a tidal wave. And that's what you get, enormous, very-well-done special effects and a so-so story that we've all seen before about a girl loved by a guy who doesn't spend much time with his dad.Where the film really fails is the part about environmental awareness and the laughably cold-hearted vice president/Dick Cheney look-alike. There's this enormous, groan-inducing ""I-told-you-so"" vibe running throughout the movie, and the final speech had my pupils glued to my eyebrows, but this subtext only comes up occasionally between scenes of hail crushing citizens of Tokyo and a multiple climate chase scenes.That drama part is stereotypical out the wazoo, but I hope nobody came into the theater seriously expecting to see a unique or surprising look at post-apocalyptic teen romance. Yes, the movie is severely predictable, with only the occasional minor surprise... but you know you ain't paying for a mystery. You're paying for entertainment. Does it come through? Yeah, it's good enough for an ""event"" film. Not great, not spectacular, but you couldn't really go through summer without seeing at least one major city destroyed, could you?",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Watch it for the CGI, and nothing more.","I don't know what to think about Emmerich, I'm aware of all the negative press he gets and some I think isn't really deserved. I haven't seen Stargate in a decade and can't accurately comment on it, I like ID4 for what it was, Godzilla was wasted potential and I have yet to see the Patriot. The biggest fall that Emmerich had is that his films are VERY impressive from a CGI and action scene standpoint, but suffer horribly in character and plot development. In fact, ID4 turned out so good in my eyes because it had plenty of good CGI and action to make up for the terrible plot. Godzilla failed because all the good stuff was at the beginning while the character and plot carried the last three-quarters of the flick. Now, after so many years out of the Hollywood limelight, Emmerich returns sans-Dean Devlin for another stab at the multi-million dollar summer project. This time, he decides to tread on even more dangerous waters with a global warming flick that is sure to agitate many a scientist. Surprisingly though, the film manages to keep the crap to a minimum.Day After Tomorrow is a global warming themed-flick that doesn't shy from bringing that issue to the front. There are countless scenes where characters will rant and rave over thermal currents, ice storms and whatnot and how ""we weren't quick enough"". Personally, I never believed in global warming, but I did try to keep personal feelings away from judging this film. On the other hand, there was plenty of attempts to turn a real-life debate into multi-gazillion dollar CGI-fest, (which were quite nice, might I add). Marvel at Los Angeles getting torn apart by tornadoes or New York getting hit by a massive flood. Watch the world freeze over and storms pound at the survivors. In fact, you'll have so much fun watching this that it more than makes up for the terrible character and plot development. Yes, a patented Emmerich trademark returns in full-force with more forced ""crisis's"" involving love and/or family interjected into odd moments. Watch a man walk across a sixth of the nation to locate his son or a love triangle that completely keels over and dies by the half-way point. Sadly, this is the entire last half of the film with poor CGI wolves being the only real action scene worth mentioning during that half. The underutilization of characters is a big problem, as there were literally dozens of characters added at various points that received little or no development and when they would die or ""contribute"" you felt no emotion.But for what it is, I was glad to see a couple good CGI scenes right away but I do wish they were more spaced out so I didn't have to pace through poor dialogue and underdeveloped or underutilized characters.6.0/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I think we all now the true stars in this movie......The effects,"Dennis Quaid, Jake Gyllehaal, Emmy Rossum, Dash Mihok, Jay O. Sanders, Sela Waed, Ian Holm, and Sasha Roiz. Directed by Roland Emmerich.I think after seeing The Day After Tomorrow we could all agree that the true stars in this flick are graphics. Still Quaid gives a Bill Paxton performance, if you don't know that is an insult. It seems they are almost alike as if one was copying the other.Any way the story revolves around Climatologist Jack Hall (Quaid) whom believes that a giant storm will come very soon. When the storm does hit it traps his son whom is visiting in New York (Gyllenhal). Jack decides he must go and save him. Roland Emmerich whom directed Independnce Day, Which I have no idea why it's so popular, I feel it's just good because of all the glamor they try to give it. Yet again they hype you up only for a bigger let down.Day After Tomorrow just proves yet again that the true stars of both Paxton and Quaid's movie are not them but the effects. Overall I did like Day After Tomorrow. My final rating 7/10. Where the actors fail the graphics pick up to keep the movie more then interesting but a cool flick to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Big Movie, Small Brain, No Dice","A disaster movie about global warming was inevitable. So was having it be directed by a director known for special effects movies. Then of course you'd also expect a big name cast (Quaid, Gyllenhaal, Holm... that's three at least). I think we all sort of expected something more in the drama department. Special effects and disaster film are not known for great dramatic conflict, but most of them at least take a stab at it. In ""The Poseidon Adventure"" the characters were pretty defined before they started to get killed off. ""The Towering Inferno"" successfully hinged on (somewhat cheesy) dramatic conflict around the characters of the architecture firm. More recently, brainless Bruckheimer himself injected enough solid sap into ""Armageddon"" to make us all go for our hankies. But then comes ""The Day After Tomorrow""...Dennis Quaid is not just a climatologist, he's a bad-ass climatologist. We first meet him jumping a massive crack forming in an icecap just in time to save valuable plot devices. When he's done being cool, we go home and meet his somewhat estranged son/eye candy Jake Gyllenhaal, and his underused doctor wife Sela Ward. This family is so troubled by Quaid's career that they spend all their time repeating one another's lines. And there's the tear-jerking trouble that young Gyllenhaal is so smart that he fails calculus by offending his teacher. God forbid any of these characters get any real human flaws or that this family be allowed to represent anything more dysfunctional than common, average happy-family tiffs. These are our heroes.So, being a bad-ass climatologist, Quaid and his expensive smile, sets out to save the world by informing people that Global Warming is going to bring on another Ice Age and doom us all. As was well advertised at the time of this film's release, this is a real theory, but that theory says nothing about the effects setting in over the course of two days. Anyhow, no sooner does Quaid try to impart this knowledge to a skeptical public and an unlikable vice-president than does the weather start to turn nasty. And Ian Holm is there too suddenly, playing a British stereotype.Because the family is the center of the film, Gyllenhaal gets on a plane to New York with some kind of competitive knowledge team, pretty much to give a reason for them to be apart when things get bad. We meet his instant girlfriend, Emmy Rossum and a couple of instant friends. When they get to New York, we cut to the zoo and meet some CGI wolves that are acting strangely and are not foreshadowing at all.Anyhow, everything starts getting cold all around the world while these guys in a space station watch (they should be eating popcorn or something). There are scenes we saw before in ""Twister"", ""The Core"", and ""Armageddon"". New York floods and then freezes, trapping Gyllenhaal and insta-girlfriend. Dennis Quaid and his token buddy Frank head off through the snow to get Gyllenhaal. Oh, and then comes Sela Ward's harrowing plight which consists of occasionally cutting back to her sitting beside a sick child in a hospital bed looking concerned. I guess Roland Emmerich thinks action (and apparently dialog) is for the menfolk. Most of this stuff reminds one of that long tag-line to ""Deep Impact"" that got truncated to ""Hope Survives"" on the poster. Of course the only thing one hopes for during this film is for it to be over so you can watch something else.Among some of the standout bad moments in this film were: the most useless movie president ever, the unestablished reporter guy getting it, the fake wolves being used as an action device, the ultra-cheesy shots of the Statue of Liberty and American flag freezing (yes, I think we knew that New York was in the USA), the dialog that just throws the first character's line back at him, and last but not least; people being chased by the cold. In reality the cold just kinda comes at a non-impressive pace, but since this film is so action-packed, the cold pursues individual people and hunts them down without mercy. I began to feel by that point that the film was doing that to me.In the end I'd gladly take ""Armageddon"" or even ""The Core"" over this lame excuse for a movie. The characters are paper thin, the disaster is ridiculous (however possible), and the conclusion is no conclusion at all. It all comes down to bad writing. Even if the acting was incredible (it isn't), the direction was astounding, or the special effects convincing, this movie would still be junk because the script is some weak junk. The first rule of stories where people are in peril is making your audience care about those people and I couldn't bring myself to give a damn about any one of them.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good disaster mediocre survival movie,"The main promise of this movie is the spectacle, and I have to say, for its time and even nowadays it holds up really well. The first half, the buildup was done well. Nothing new, it really follows the disaster movie plotline, but it looks good. Apart from this I can't praise anything else. The second half with the rescue mission was definitely something we seen a lot of time. It wasn't bad or boring, it was watchable, but it is still forgettable. None of the characters were deep or interesting, we just saw them go trough a hard time. The movie touches some ethical questions, but only briefly. It would have been way more interesting if they ditched the survival plot part and showcased how humanity as a whole goes trough this, how society changes, or focus on the people stuck and give more interesting characters with a deeper reflection on the event and ourselves.

The feelings that betray us...,"We just get more and more disaster movies each year. Actually we don't give a damn about less than the half of them, but from time to time, a super production costing millions and we got to see it. Last year, ""The Day After Tomorrow"" was that super production.These movies don't get as wild as this one. German director Roland Emmerich makes a big effort to improve his style each time he makes a new movie. The movies he directs are not always potentially prepared to be ""art"", but the man takes the job too seriously, and you can tell the movies are ""his""; even when he doesn't write them. He commits completely and achieves visual levels beyond imagination. He takes care of little details, like not showing some computer animated wolves closely, so they look as real as possible.Regretfully, I haven't seen any good movie under his direction. I never finished watching ""The Patriot"", though; and I was loving it. And yes, Emmerich's specialty is ""disaster"" films. There's a big dilemma with disaster films, because they try untiringly to mix action and, well, disaster, with emotion. I has worked for me with ""Daylight"", a movie that was for me a before and after disaster films (as one of Sylvester Stallone best performances). Why? Simply because its only cliché was the ""disaster""; and that's for me the best compliment you can give a movie of this type.Other recent ""disaster"" film was ""Deep Impact""; and I admit I tended to laugh in the most dramatic moments of the film; because I couldn't feel for the one-dimensional character and I preferred them to die than to listen to them saying melodramatic shits in their final moments.Now the thing is; Roland Emmerich may know a lot about disaster, but knows nothing about drama. As he has probably done before, he checks the book of clichés so he can provide some substance in what he does worse. What we get from him in this occasion is one weak father-son relationship, with separated marriages, a father that works constantly and doesn't have time for his son. Yet, when he father arrives late or forgets things, the boy forgives himThe boy loves him, and loves a girl, and has a friendAnd the three of them go to New York for a contest, but Jack is working with professor Rapson and discovers the new Ice Age is coming (and you know how it goes from that) In another ensemble cast with the stars of the moment, the father is called Jack Hall, and is played by Dennis Quaid; who has been climbing to the top since ""The Rookie"". I've heard he has been doing the same for a long time (although I was shocked by his performance in ""Far From Heaven""), but even in his clichéd character with hero moments, he passes the acting test. The mother's name is Lucy, and Sela Ward gives her agility and emotion. Professor Rapson is in Ian Holm's skin, and Holm is bored; looking for money maybe.The son is called Sam Hall, in the skin of Jake Gyllenhaal, coming as the best element of the film; with a lot of personality and charm to a role that as easy as the one he had. It's another big step in his short career. The girl, Laura, it's played by Emmy Rossum. She looks gorgeous and very natural. They are the ones that will stay with a bunch of other, few people (the ""Survivors""), as the victims with no way out, and Sam's responsibility according to script is not more than saving them. Do the ""Survivors"" survive? What do you think? To accentuate things more, Emmerich supports the dramatic environment with pathetic but sweet moving music, set decorations, designs and cinematographyOnce said that, the movie looks beautiful, and the special effects are flawless; but maybe that's the only thing Emmerich can do without problems.As we will see many years from now, the movie had to be set in New YorkThey just love to destroy those thingsThe Statue of Liberty, The Empire StateIf they are going to freeze a city, New York will be the first choice.When the film ended and the credits were rolling, I wondered: If Roland Emmerich knows so much about disaster and nothing about dramaWhy doesn't he just destroys everything without leaving any trace of life? Then the screen was black.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Father Vs. Mother Nature for his Son,"The movie begins in Antarctic where a huge crack occurs whats surprising is the there is no water below that ice.

But what happens next is what the film is all about. The predictions made by him takes effect immediately and the result is multiple hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, tidal waves, floods and the beginning of the next Ice Age.The result of this is the entire northern hemisphere is turned in to ice up to the head of the statute of liberty and ships coming into Manhattan city is captured beautifully on camera. Between this is a small sentimental touch (INDIAN STYLE) between the son Sam (Gyllenhaal) and the father (Dennis). Sam is in N.Y and hall is in D.C and the journey of a father to rescue his son is the rest of the story.Directed by Roland Emmerich the director who gave us THE INDEPENDENCE DAY decides to choose the biggest villain nature.

An Amazing Movie!,"The Day After Tomorrow, simply, is a great movie. Great acting, great plot, awesome special effects, keeps you on the edge of your seat, and, of course, Jake Gyllenhaal. There is really nothing negative to say about the movie. You may need to watch it a few times in order to fully understand it, if you are at a young age, but it's definitely very captivating, especially the first time you see it. The movie also has some educational value. A lot of the facts about the earth's climate are untrue, as was done on purpose, but if you watch the movie enough you will learn something. Also, I found it quite a good statement, in this day and age, that they had Americans crossing the border into Mexico. I feel this promotes good feelings towards Mexicans, even if it is only a movie. On the topic of the acting, Dennis Quaid was very convincing as a busy, somewhat obsessed father who doesn't have much time for his children. Jake Gyllenhaal and Emmy Rossum were brilliant as two high school students, and all the supporting roles in the film were done stupendously as well. Another good thing about the movie was that it had a lot of variety. There were funny moments, mostly in the beginning of the movie, there were sad moments, when people died, there were lots of suspenseful moments, and there were moments that were close to terrifying. The special effects in the movie were done amazingly well, and the plot was rock solid. Admittedly, I saw the movie for Jake Gyllenhaal, but I ended up loving the whole thing!

Environmental Escapism,"The message of this movie is that climate change will lead to climate change and we need to address its implications, no matter what the cause. Of course everything is in hyper-time to allow the drama to unfold in two hours. Everything that happens is a ""fantasy"" in the space that things happen. This is a true ""suspension of disbelief"" that is a definite requirement for any chance of this having any entertainment value.Basically it is another CGI disaster movie that delivers mass destruction on a mass scale that is always a fun, if kinda sick, thing to watch.

There are holes in the ozone of this plot that are glacial and the characters are stereotypical and the audience manipulation is manic.

Boring,"I wasn't expecting much from this, only some mild entertainment. Yet, I was disappointed. Halfway through the movie I was checking my watch and feeling like it was never going to end...The disaster scenes didn't seem very impressive (I guess there are only so many ways for a filmmaker to tear apart the statue of liberty and still make it noteworthy), and I really didn't care much for the characters. Even the confrontation between the noble scientist-hero and the stupid bureaucrat Vice-President seemed too stereotypical.On top of everything else, apparently reaching for the status of ""serious movie"" (without being successful) The Day After Tomorrow lacks any sense of humor.And what were they thinking on that stupid sequence with the obvious cgi wolves - how lame was that?Perhaps Emmerich's work is suffering with the absence of old partner Dean Devlin.ID4 was certainly not very brilliant, but at least was fun. And Stargate (an incomprehensibly underrated movie) had a really interesting premise. But then again, the idea for that wasn't really Emmerich's...",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Action/Disaster with great effects and a good story,"As the saying goes: there's no accounting for taste. So, I strongly disagree with the negative review featured on this movie's info page. One should note, however, that the reviewer, ""Libertio,"" gives high praise to several of the visual effects and calls the satirical scenes ""potent."" I think Libertio misses the point when he criticizes the story which I found plausible and of more than ordinary interest, particularly for a disaster movie. Please be aware that my ""10"" rating is based on a comparison with other movies of this type; it is not absolute.Furthermore, I think movie ratings should be ""conditional"" rather than absolute. Isn't it unfair to compare, say, ""Something About Mary"" with ""Schindler's List?"" Along these lines I would ask Libertio what other action/disaster movies does he consider superior to ""Tomorrow?"" As for myself, I found the effects chilling (pun intended), surprising, and awe inspiring. The scientific thesis underlying the story may be unlikely or even false as some scientists have stated, but the vast majority of scientists in the field do think that the earth is undergoing a warming period and that humans are contributing to this phenomenon.So, the-end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it story this movie postulates does reverberate in the popular mind. May I suggest that the plot may be a bit too plausible to be really enjoyed by the popular mind? Otherwise, I, for one, find it difficult to account for the overall lowish rating given in IMDb's survey.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Cheesy, but good.","I went to see The Day After Tomorrow, excited to see the special effects and watch a different type of an 'end of the world movie'. And that's what I got. It would have been better if there weren't as many cheesy (there's not really another word to describe it) scenes between the parents and their son. I rolled my eyes multiple times throughout the film, and as I left the theater, there were people who were quoting some of the worst lines of the movie and laughing, so it wasn't just me.Overall, though, I found it very interesting and surprisingly intense in some parts. It's good to see this type of movie in theaters in order to get the best sound quality and special effects.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Greenpeace's idea of product placement,"In case you are wondering where the summary comes from, the man who founded Greenpeace, Patric Moore, once described his former organisation as ""a band of scientific illiterates who use Gestapo tactics..."". Things like facts, accuracy, or plausibility don't matter to the likes of Greenpeace, and it is pretty apparent that they don't matter to Roland Emmerich a hell of a lot, either. If the slightest shred of doubt that Emmerich was practically living on another planet after Independence Day or Godzilla existed, The Day After Tomorrow has completely erased it.NASA has actually stated that the events depicted in this film were so ridiculous that they could never occur. Emmerich has it that they could occur, but he sped up the time frame. Given that Emmerich can't even hold a camera without insulting someone's intelligence or ethnicity (seriously, Godzilla was one of the most racist films of the late 1990s), I know which side of this story I believe.The major problem with the film is that when we're not being subjected to shots of impossible action from the weather, the film is as boring as hell. Even some of the action sequences, such as the Vertical Limit ripoff, are about as interesting as the constant scare campaigns that anti-choice groups such as Greenpeace come out with. It is a supreme irony that during one of the book-burning sequences, one character states that he wants to preserve the Gutenberg bible because it represents the greatest achievement of mankind. The written word has been with us far longer than the Gutenberg bible, and since the original purpose of the written word was to share knowledge, it is more of a great misuse.Apparently, plausible story elements are not the only thing that Roland Emmerich forgot about. During one shot of the sky as birds migrate to who knows where, said birds go straight through buildings. Then we have a sequence where three of our heroes are attacked by wolves who traveled across Manhattan to find them. Apparently, wolves are invulnerable to all the spontaneous tornadoes, blizzards, and tidal waves, we witnessed earlier. And don't get me started on the infected cut plot device. It is truly amazing how film characters can defy the laws of physics in one second by outrunning a tidal wave, and be on death's door in the next.In all honesty, I want to know how much Greenpeace contributed towards the film's budget. If plausibility were essential to box office success, The Day After Tomorrow would have been the biggest tax write-off in the history of Hollywood. If things ever get to the stage where we have to burn books in order to keep warm, it won't be in spite of people like Roland Emmerich. It will be because of them. Ergo, nobody should be surprised that I gave this pile a one out of ten.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Does everything a disaster movie is supposed to and more,"There were moments of sadness, awe, and thrills.I was surprised at the anger of right-wingers over this movie, and so went to see what was so offensive to them, and saw nothing.Yeah, the actor was an almost look-a-like for Dick Cheney, but it wouldn't have made a difference who it was, they were going to get reamed for not taking the warnings seriously. This is a staple for ALL disaster movies. Someone always doesn't get it until it's too late.But the real star of this movie was the weather. When the weather gets seriously gets out of control it is amazing and terrifying to see.What do you do when there is no safe place to run? I mean, in the theater that I was in, everyone was screaming at the screen, once the danger started. What a ride.And I loved how the movie moved from an overview of the situation, or a wide story, into a a more personal story.That was as it should be as well. Overall, I thought it was a great movie that had a message we might need to start chewing on to find an answer to.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Technicalities be damned - this movie had heart.,"The Day After Tomorrow is certainly the perfect example of fiction gone awry. It takes an implausible theory and puts it into practice, turning our relatively peaceful world, into an icy mass, nearly overnight. No catastrophic event, no comet crashing to the ground. It just happens. And it happens in a big way. A half dozen or more tornadoes in Los Angeles. Three super storms. Softball sized hail. Tidal waves and flooding of massive proportions. And the lifeless cold temperatures and transformation of everything into ice and death. And still meteorologists probably kept their jobs!So here's where the story goes wrong: even in the greatest of fiction there has to be some believability in the audience's mind. The entire climatology plot, the catalyst to everything else in the movie, was not very believable. Further, the hospital and mother side story wasn't needed. But despite all of this, I still enjoyed this movie.Why? Heart. You can't help but like a movie that has heart. The relationship between dad and son (played excellently by Quaid and Gyllenhaal respectively). The struggle to stay alive and to help one another. The Lewis and Clark spirit of adventure and endurance. These are the qualities that make the movie worth the watch. So much so that I almost forgot about the weather in the movie, and was able to focus rather on its inner story. All of the actors did a fine job rising to the occasion in this movie, and they, certainly above special effects or dramatic content, made the movie enjoyable.I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone looking for that feel-good quality in a flick. If you're one to get too hung up on technicalities, then this movie isn't likely for you. But if you're one who looks for the meat and heart in a movie, then I'm betting, despite the many disbeliefs, you'll find some of what you are looking for here.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Disaster film not disastrous,"Disaster movies are in general a part of cinema best avoided; despite Irwin Allen's commercially successful spate in the 70s (and Poseidon Adventure wasn't that bad, but), I still feel they are a genre more or less best eschewed if possible. But the teaser trailer released at the top of the year for Day After Tomorrow was very enticing; brief shots of hurricanes, destruction, and then, echoing one of the most memorable shots in cinematic history, a frozen Statue of Liberty as we pan up from a team of arctic travelers to see New York as a giant frozen tomb. I was intrigued by this film until I saw that it would be masterminded by Roland Emmerich, who in my mind is responsible for more bad modern cinema than any other one person (even Jerry Bruckheimer). Emmerich is the 'genius' who brought us the tepid Stargate and the blasphemous American version of Godzilla, and taught us with Independence Day that a crappy film craftily advertised will do big box office. So he has a history of misleading us with glossy trailers that promise a quality that his movies never contain, and has proven to be a master at enticing the public to see films best avoided even on video.Thus I went in skeptically yesterday, prepared to be let down as the movie failed to live up to even a sliver of the promise of the trailer. And, yes, Day After Tomorrow is not without its flaws. But I was rather surprised to find that while it is a disaster film, it is not a disastrous film, as some have claimed (to me, critics are especially ignorant this summer), but rather a fairly well done film with effects and concepts that will, yes, knock your eyes out.The plot mechanics owe a lot to lesser films like Armageddon and the like: we've screwed up the earth and we don't realize it, and Mama Nature bites us in the butt faster than we can prepare for. That an ice age can be triggered overnight is a bit much to take, but they at least try to explain why it can happen and I'm nowhere near enough of a meteorologist to know if what they said was bunk or not. All I know is that the science sounded good, and that's all it needs to in a decent story. And anything that gets gas-guzzling Americans to even consider global warming is doing a huge public service.Emmerich (wrote and directed) chooses the necessary human element in such a story to revolve around the Halls; father Jack (Dennis Quaid) is a climatologist who in the Emmerichian tradition is the first to realize we're headed to hell in a hand basket (see Jeff Goldblum in ID4 for a far less effective version of this character). Mother Lucy (Sela Ward) is a doctor, and is given only minor screen time. Most of the human angle revolves around son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal, the guy you get when you can't get Tobey Maguire), who is trapped with several brainy school chums in NYC at a nerdy academic contest. Also along for the ride is the ever-terrific Ian Holm, who plays English weather guru Terry Rapson.Though the entire world is affected by the events in the story, Emmerich wisely has most of the story take place in New York, a place most of us are familiar enough with so the massive destruction means a little more (come on, if he had destroyed Reno, who would have cared?). We are treated to sumptuous visuals of New York flooding and then freezing in some of the most effective computer wizardry ever, and though we know what we are seeing isn't real, never once can you actually tell. The visuals are simply perfect, not only well-rendered but well-realized, and though we will probably never live to see the next ice age, I had no trouble accepting that it may look like this (though it will likely develop a lot more slowly).Sure, the plot dips into some clichés  Lucy stays behind at the hospital to tend to a tug-at- your-heart bald cancer child, Sam has to try and win the affection of his pretty teammate Laura (Emmy Rossum) from the hunky local rich kid who helps them out, and once again the scientists know more than them evil guv'mint types, but for all that pablum, the human element in the story comes off pretty well. Quaid can play earnest with the best of them, and his performance goes a long way in helping to sell the film (at one point I wondered what the film would have been like with ID4's Bill Pullman in the Quaid role and shuddered). Ward, though her part is small, is also very good, and Ian Holm plays Rapson with his standard understated grace; when the good doctor at one point raises his scotch and utters, 'To mankind,' it's not maudlin, it's heartfelt. A large part of the film rests on Gyllenhaal's shoulders, and he, like Holm, underplays his role, which is a relief in this type of film.Day After Tomorrow isn't exactly brain candy, but it is an interesting and well-executed disaster movie. The few times it goes overboard  like a silly race against a chilling wind  are easily forgiven because they are surrounded by all of the things done well. It won't win any awards for the movie of the year, but it was a damn sight better than I expected, and, preaching at the end aside, I left the film extremely pleasantly surprised. The Day After Tomorrow entertains completely, pulling us in at the start and never letting go of its hold on our imagination, and really, isn't that what we go to the movies for?",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Hokey, but entertainingly enjoyable","Surely no one's walking into Roland Emmerich's ""The Day After Tomorrow"" expecting to see a neorealist masterpiece or some profoundly moving epic about the human condition.The man loves to blow things up on screen and that's exactly what he does in ""The Day After Tomorrow."" Of Emmerich's last four pictures, I enjoyed the ""Day"" films - ""Independence Day"" and this one. The other two - ""The Patriot"" and ""Godzilla"" were crap.""The Day After Tomorrow"" has some terrific visual effects - the destruction of the Capitol Records building in Los Angeles, the tidal wave in New York City, the west coast twisters.Of course, the story is conventional. You have the customary protagonist who needs to rescue his family, the cute animal, the love interest, the people who ignore common sense and set out on their own because they know better and, of course, the self-sacrificing supporting character.The dialogue is hokey at times, the plot a bit like Swiss cheese and the performances nothing out of the ordinary. Though, British actor Ian Holm manages to bring a semblance of depth to his small role, proving yet again how good he is at his craft.Question the film's science, if you must. The filmmakers don't try to mask the identity of who the vice-president and president are based on. Though, the most preposterous thing in the film is that our veep would actually show up at an environmental conference.""The Day After Tomorrow"" has all the requisite ingredients for a summer blockbuster.

The characters just sit around for hours in their various locations looking glum until the world's worst disaster of a director decides it's too boring even for him, so slaps that whole, totally lame wolf scene in there. I'm never going to see a blockbuster again because there are no longer any masters of the art at the helm(Spielberg, Cameron, Burton) CGI rules Hollywood and nobody seems to care if the movies are actually any good. You still need good directors to make this stuff look good. The CGI effects in Jurassic Park and T2 were nowhere near as advanced as in this movie, but were used and directed brilliantly.

In all fairness, the writing was probably far more to blame for the awkward predictability than Gyllenhaal himself.

not all that great but still hard to resist,"Like a spoiled little brat having a temper tantrum in his overstuffed playroom, Roland Emmerich loves to destroy things - only he does so on a scale far beyond the dreams of even the most literal-minded schoolboy. Cars, buildings, national monuments, whole cities - nothing is too grand or sacrosanct that it can't be reduced to rubble in the filmmaker's quest for the almighty buck. He began his assault on the planet and audience sensibilities back in 1996 with ""Independence Day,"" in which he used aliens from outer space to do his dirty work for him. Two years later, in ""Godzilla,"" he resurrected a campy cultural icon to smash New York City into tiny little pieces for our pleasure and edification. Now, in ""The Day After Tomorrow,"" Emmerich has gone for the gold by having Mother Nature herself - as the ultimate woman scorned - pushing humanity to the brink of extinction as payment for our sin of casual indifference to the ecologically-sensitive world around us. This is mass-market film-making with a social conscience.""The Day After Tomorrow"" is what people generally have in mind when they refer to ""mindless summertime popcorn entertainment"" - a big-budget disaster picture with state-of-the-art special effects, minimalist plotting and wafer-thin characterizations. This current vision of worldwide apocalypse shows what happens when mankind fails to heed the warnings of global warming: storms of unprecedented scope and ferocity are unleashed on major metropolitan areas in the Northern Hemisphere and a new ice age begins. The Chicken Little of the piece is one Dr. Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid), a climatologist who can't get anyone to listen to his dire predictions for the future until it's too late and the sky has literally fallen in. The ""plot"" involves Jack setting off on a suicide mission to rescue his son, Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) and some of his classmates who have been entombed in a snow- and ice-bound New York City.As a storyteller, Emmerich pays a price for his pedantry and social crusading, failing to provide the kind of dramatic arc that turned ""Independence Day"" into such a rabble-rousing entertainment. In ""The Day After Tomorrow,"" once the destruction of LA and Manhattan have been effectively dramatized - the former by tornadoes and the latter by a tidal wave-cum-blizzard - the film lapses into a mundane narrative pattern, so that the final hour or so consists of little more than people trudging through the snow trying to stay warm. The film turns out to be almost all build-up with very little pay off. Nevertheless, some of the imagery is indeed fantastic, especially that of the skyline of New York City literally frozen under a coating of ice and snow. The characters barely register as people and we really don't care what happens to any of them, but there's still an irresistible pull to much of the film, particularly in the first half, mainly because it shows us how very vulnerable we are to the great natural forces that rule our planet. The movie makes us feel as if we are mere guests in this world, being allowed to exist here only by the grace and whim of a power that - either through malice or fatal indifference - could wipe us out in no time flat.""The Day After Tomorrow"" is the movie equivalent of a 50-car pileup. You know there's nothing particularly edifying to be gained by watching it, but you can't help looking at it anyway. You can con yourself into believing that you're studying it as a warning against unsafe driving when, deep down inside, you know that what is really holding your attention is all that destruction and carnage. So it is with this movie. The salutary environmental message is really only the pretext for watching the human race get a first-class ass-whippin'.My only question is what can Emmerich possibly do for an encore?",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Best of Emmrich's work,"So, seeing as Roland Emmerich's Independence Day: Resurgence is out today! (Review coming to a blog near you) I though I would do one of Emmerich's earlier films for a #throwbackthursday and no, it's not going to be the first Independence Day as I don't want to write about another alien invasion twice, back to back from the same film maker. Instead I'm choosing The Day After Tomorrow (which would be Saturday) because it's probably my favourite of his.I'm not a great fan for Emmerich. Not forgiving him for what he did to Godzilla and his recent disasters have been, well, literally disasters in my opinion. I thought 2012 was more like an elaborate Final Destination and I was actually willing John Cusack's character to die and with 10,000 BC being of average fare. I did enjoy Patriot, and I liked Stargate, but The Day After Tomorrow is my favourite out his movies.We see Mother Nature wreck havoc across the globe, bringing an abrupt ice age but not before bringing floods and hurricanes across it's cities. Out of all of Emmerich's disaster movies this seemed the most believable. The effects were good for its age and you actually get emotionally invested in the characters more than the other films. It's also got a good balance between the rest of the world and the stars of the story which it centres around. Son of Global Warming specialist trapped in flooded and sub zero New York whilst father does what any father would want to do, go get him. There's even a little romantic interest thrown in there that isn't silly or overbearing.I think it's fair to say Jake Gyllenhaal was still relative new to the big screen getting his major breakthrough with Donnie Darko in 2001 and this being his next great recognition playing Dennis Quaid's son. Dennis Quaid is believable as is the rest of the cast. Ian Holm giving his final wish as a piece of advice, Shameless Emmy Rossum (Mystic River, Phantom of The Opera) being the girl next door love interest and Dash Mihok (Silver Linings Playbook, I Am Legend) is great as Quaid's trusted assistant/buddy.It's seems the mixture was just right, well balanced, well structured and one that really brought it home about global warming. Even Emmerich's regular composer Harald Kloser does a fine score to suit the movie.Out of all of Emmerich's sci-fi/disaster movies, this one has the most believability and character investment. It lacked the usual silly characters Emmerich normally has in films for comedy relief like Woody Harrelson or Randy Quaid, this one, seems to takes itself seriously.Running Time: 8 The Cast: 8 Performance: 8 Direction: 8 Story: 8 Script: 7 Creativity: 8 Soundtrack: 7 Job Description: 8 The Extra Bonus Points: 070% 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Welcome to the Summer of 2004 - Popcorn Galore!,"Yes, this is 2004 Summer movie blockbuster popcorn film. It's not bad..but it isn't good either. It's as so-so as they come with a few special moments to keep you entertained and your mind off of other things outside of the theater.I've gotta be honest, I do believe that no one has a control over Nature and no one knows what's going to happen from one moment to the next.  Can this happen? Sure. So can the Sun hurling towards the planet, drying up all of the water and frying everyone to a crisp. (Don't you DARE take that idea from me Roland!!!)But this is quite a speculation and gives you pause to wonder..""what if"". Of course many of us would have done things differently, and of course many of us would do what some did in the film. But besides the fact, I found Dennis Quaid's role not interesting enough for me.  Jake Gyllenhall's role I could take or leave....okay, I'll be honest, the only acting that made me interested was that of the wolves.But that star of the film is the special effects and the chills I got seeing two of my favorite places become ""disaster city"". I live in Los Angeles and the VISUAL of Tornadoes in Hollywood was amazing and I was born and raised in New York City so seeing it freeze over was chilling to say the least. A lot of plot holes, but this was...entertaining. The best part was the ""solution"" of where Americans had to go for refuge. Now, that was entertaining!The Day After Tomorrow is a far cry and from ""Independence Day"" mind you, but okay if you've got nothing to do and matinee money to spend.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Return of the Disaster Movie,"This should have been christened ""the disaster movie after so many years"" for its brave attempt at rekindling the fiery storm that gave birth to so many of its ilk back in the second half of the Nineties. Remember Dante's Peak, Volcano, Twister and The Perfect Storm? Well, maybe not. Perhaps your recollection is hindered by echoes of Deep Impact and Armaggedon. But definitely consider making room for The Day After Tomorrow, which, incidentally, has nothing to do with the 1983 Cold War epic, in case you were wondering. Nope, this one goes on the assumption that every imaginable climactic calamity could somehow transpire concurrently with its devilish counterparts, engulfing mother earth in an almost instantaneous natural debacle of biblical proportions. Of course, it's all humanity's fault for being so reckless with our misuse of the planet's resources, and for shopping at The Gap. Fortunately, this flick keeps its political agenda-making to a minimum, since Emmerich was probably more occupied with paying proper homage to classics like Meteor (1979) than ameliorating the green party circuit. And props were nicely given, thank you, as TDAT follows Meteor's example by touching on the same locations more or less, namely Tokyo, Los Angeles, and New york (where most of the action goes down). Despite having a budget to rival that of many small nations, the movie doesn't quite feel huge as expected. Its effects get the job done effortlessly, but do not represent the phenomenal leap forward many were anticipating. Most of what we get to see has already been rendered to some extent in the past. However, TDAT stands out from the mushy, kitch-driven posse by being, well, not as mushily kitch-driven. Sure, there's some patriotic pandering, but not enough to make one squirm uncomfortably in their stadium seats. And the leading cast all do their respective roles believably enough, with Dennis Quaid as climatologist Jack Hall, whose warnings of an impending global breakdown in weather patterns falls on deaf political ears until it's all too late. When hail bigger than your average Whopper descends on Tokyo, and flash tornadoes ""dismantle"" Los Angeles (to quote the hilarious press material we saw online prior to the film's release), everybody more or less gets the picture. What follows looks a lot like Emmerich's superb Godzilla remake, yet has little of its charm and sardonic humor. We get the same healthy dose of widespread, PG-13 havoc, where you're supposed to know scores of people are meeting a grisly collective demise, but hardly ever get to see them buying it in any vivid sense of the expression. As long as one understands what they're getting into, this amounts to no problem at all. Back to the story, Hall must hike it to New York to find his son (Jake Gyllenhaall, from October Sky and Donnie Darko), a laid-back kid infatuated with pretty classmate Laura (Emmy Rossum), and stranded in the NYC public library with a group of courageous, shake 'n' bake survivalists. If this hints at how it would take a new ice age to make people pick up a book, we certainly didn't get it. Beyond the main thread of select, inventive individuals toughing it out we witness a scant few other plot lines. Ian Holm pops in to do Hall's temporary mentor, and Riptide's excellent Perry Kind returns to the big screen momentarily as President Baker, whose chopper promptly falls to the colossal storm in a nod to Indpendence Day. Most disarmingly, Sela Ward does Miss Hall, a pale character the movie could have done equally well were it bereft of her Left Behind Good Samaritan cliché. What's so cool about The Day After Tomorrow is that nobody expects the audience to really take it seriously, but at the same time it's far from preposterous. All in all, Emmerich and crew's competence shows through in most departments, a walk in the park for them in light of so much experience handling these monumental end-of-the-world projects. While some in the screening we attended muttered ""where's the comet in all of this?"", rest assured TDAT poses no risk of boredom or frustration. Certainly at times it trespasses, like when coverage of a blizzard in Scotland blatantly uses footage shot in Minnesota, or with the brave New York nouveau-librarians scrounging for supplies on a Russian ship that somehow made its way to their doorstep along flooded Manhattan streets, but overall the film remains a solid, entertaining product. As a bonafide examination of current ecological topics, The Day After Tomorrow leaves much to be desired. As prelude to what seems to be building toward a summer science fiction renaissance, it earns the cover price with great dignity.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Some great destruction scenes but not much else,"The Day After Tomorrow is entertaining during the first half of the film but by the second half of the movie it starts to drag. Global warming and the greenhouse effect have devastating effects on the earth when a series of hurricanes, tornadoes and tidal waves kick off a second Ice Age. Professor Adrian Hall (Quaid), a leading scientist studying weather patterns, must try to save the world as well as find his son (Gyllenhaal) who was in New York City when it was struck by the sudden weather catastrophe. This type of movie has three factors that it needs to have if it wants a wider audience. First, Are the destruction scenes thrilling? Judging by the trailer alone you can see that they are. Second, Is the science sound? In this case it isn't as global warming is a big issue and making a joke out of it will upset some people and turn them away. And third is the dialog good or will you laugh out at some of the scenes? Well there are some unintentional funny moments when they are trying to be serious but it sounds too stupid and its hard to take seriously. If you want the last two factors in this film then I recommend you don't watch it, however if the destruction scenes are good enough for you then its worth it. Roland Emmerich has a good eye for destruction and he makes this movie very action packed but left out everything else. The cast is good for the most part with the best being Dennis Quaid who really made up for The Alamo and does a good job in his role. Jake Gyllenhaal was good and I am kind of surprised he isn't more popular in Hollywood since he is a very good actor. Emmy Rossum, Sela Ward and Ian Holm all play their roles fine and try their best with a unrealistic plot. The first half of the movie is great with tons of action and with a lot of great scenes like the tornadoes in LA, though I think they should have destroyed another city. The second half starts getting boring and there's not much action also it has a very cheesy ending. Rating 6/10 it was a decent destruction flick and it was very entertaining in the beginning but loses steam by the end.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A life support system for its special effects.  Yawn.,"I really liked Stargate, so I had to give this one a shot, and I have to admit that Roland Emmerich delivers eye candy by the boatload. But I have several problems with the movie.First, it is encumbent upon a writer to lure us into his premise by careful and deliberate steps designed to persuade us to suspend our disbelief. Emmerich has a speech regarding global climate changes being delivered in India, and as we step outside, the changes have already materialized. Is that a setup? Man, that is weak!Then we hear all about how disrupting the Atlantic Ocean currents could cause serious problems, and then we cut to disasters in Los Angeles and Tokyo. Now as far as I know, neither of those cities have frontage on the Atlantic Ocean.Well, I could go on, because the story has more holes than a block of Swiss cheese, but the point is that a lot more work should have been done on getting the science right.As if that weren't enough, the whole story degenerates into two lame plot lines; estranged family brought back together by catastrophe, and boy meets girl. Now that would be fine if the main story line were strong enough not to get stuck in the mud, but it isn't, and it does.In the end, Day After ends up being a life support system for its special effects. Yawn.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Day After Tomorrow: 7/10,"Summer releases released in May usually don't sustain for the whole summer. Take a look at last year's examples, like The Matrix Reloaded. A month after its release you could barely find it anywhere. That might happen to The Day After Tomorrow, but it's better than those mediocre action movies we got last year. The previews for The Day After Tomorrow made the movie out to be a movie with spectacular special effects and a decent story to tie it all together. For once, the trailers tell the truth.Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) is a paleoclimatologist (what a distinguished job!) who predicts that major weather changes will occur in 100 to 1000 years. No one believes him (of course!), but soon afterwards, the climate does start to change. The oceans flood, causing distress in much of the northern hemisphere, including Jack's son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal), who's currently in New York, waiting out the storm in a library. Jack decides to go from Washington, D.C. to New York to get his son.The special effects were more than what they looked on that stupid 10 minute preview on Fox. They were amazing. The special effects-and the effects that it had on the citizens of New York-looked very real. It brought that fact that this global warming could occur to us at anytime. Director Roland Emmerich can really use these special effects at the perfect time for the best effect. They are some of the most realistic effects I have ever seen in movies.Usually in movies like this, there's a seesaw effect. The better the effects, the worse the script. Amazingly enough, Tomorrow's script wasn't half bad. Although it did have the typically cheesy dialogue (""He's a straight-A student, he doesn't fail classes!""), the amount of characters generally stays small, and it doesn't blow the movie out of proportion. A few humorous characters are thrown in, and the script's representations of the President and Vice-President (dead-on characterizations of our current ones) are very funny. The script does go for pathos and stereotypes a little, though. Jack's wife Lucy (Sela Ward) is a doctor caring for a boy with cancer when the storm happens, so we are supposed to feel bad for the boy. When we see the effects in Japan, all we see are drunk Japanese businessmen. The worst, though, is what made me not watch the rest of the second season of 24. Wolves escape from a zoo and end up on a Russian ship in New York where Sam and co. go to look for supplies. If that isn't stupid, I don't know what is. One last thing I didn't like about the script: there was no sense of time. Scenes took place right after each other with no way of telling how much time had taken place in between.It's no wonder why The Alamo failed at the box office. Because of Dennis Quaid. He comes off of his best work in The Rookie to do The Alamo, Cold Creek Manor, and Tomorrow. He just doesn't seem to work here. While watching Gyllenhaal, I realized how much I was looking forward to the re-release of Donnie Darko this summer, so I could see him in a movie where he acted well. But I put this all beside me as I was being constantly entertained at The Day After Tomorrow, probably the only good action movie of this summer.My rating: 7/10Rated PG-13 for intense situations of peril.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The screen shot is only of the satellite locations, and shows NO geographic data. It's too bad that they didn't exploit the unit's true capabilities for better screen shots.

Why do they burn books, instead of wood from the furniture. Wood produces more heat than paper, lasts longer and so on.. - 3rd. It's been snowing and freezing for days in New York, and still Jack Hall sees the people (from the library) dead in the snow.

"drivel disguised as dialogue, but still entertaining","This is an entertaining movie in spite of the ridiculous dialogue.

They are literally all going to die if they don't burn something for heat and since they are in a library the items they have a profusion of to burn is , yeah, books! Doh!

Emmerich's big disaster flick strikes big,"This movie offers some sheer excitement but seems to suffer from a cheesy plot and the usual disaster movie clichés, such as all of the main cast surviving and having an asshole of a leader who questions the professionals authorities. This movie does offer some fine acting by it's leading cast (especially Quaid). It also has some of the most realistic special effects I have ever seen. Dennis Quaid gives a better performance than he did in ""The Alamo"". Some of the things that happened in this movie were pretty unrealistic (aside from the tornadoes, hail, etc.). The plot seems to be too simple and everything's happens so quickly. Unlike ""Independence Day"", this movie bounces around from Tokyo to LA, until it finally rests on the peril in New York. The thing I like about Roland is his attention to detail and his strong use of government agencies. In this case, it's the NOAA. All in all, this makes to be a pretty interesting film.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Big and Bad,"From the man who brought us such disaster areas as 'Independence Day' and 'Godzilla' comes this latest disaster; The Day After Tomorrow. As you probably already know, The Day After Tomorrow is about bad weather. Lots of it, all coming at once; we've got hurricanes, tidal waves, hail stones, snow and, well, actually that's it. For a movie that professes to have lots of disasters; it's seriously lacking. The disasters, when they're on, are a huge disappointment. Judging by the trailers, you would expect the disasters to make up most of the film, but this isn't the case. The effects are outstanding, but the disaster scenes themselves don't last long at all, and they're not even very exciting. The scenarios tend to cut off before the money shot kicks in, so what we're left with is several 'half' disasters and, overall, I get the impression that Roland Emmerich can't handle the vast scale of the film. Between the disasters, we are given the staple 'human drama behind the disaster' set-up, and like most disaster films before this one; it's terrible and very much something that you will be better off missing. In fact, if you've seen the trailer, then really; you've seen the film.As you might expect; the film is set in America. As if America is the only country on earth, all the action is centred there and all other countries have to either make do with a mention, or more commonly; nothing at all. We are treated to sequences such as The Statue of Liberty sticking out of the snow; but never any others. Where's the Eiffel tower while all this is going on? Buckingham Palace? The Taj Mahal? Stone Henge? Nope, because if it's not America, it's not important. Or at least that's the case with this film. Somehow, there's time for a scene where the American flag freezes, but there isn't time to show what's happening to the Kremlin. Ridiculous. Speaking of ridiculous, let's move on to the human drama side of the film. The main story follows a father (Dennis Quaid) who must travel all the way to New York to rescue his son (Jake Gyllenhaal) who has become trapped in the snow. For a start, this plot is ridiculous; the weather shown in this film is so extreme that you'd be taking a risk walking to the local post office (assuming it's still there, of course), but somehow this guy is able to walk halfway across America? Something tells me that Emmerich doesn't fully respect his audience's intelligence. The drama is also dripping with sickly fake sentiment, which only serves in being pathetic. The film is also far too upbeat; it centres on a disaster that has killed millions of people, and yet we're supposed to feel good because a father has managed to save his son? What about all the other people that have lost their lives?Good points? Well, the film does have some interesting sequences. One of which sees a reporter get whisked away by a piece of debris while reporting on the tornado's that are sweeping the country, another sees a helicopter pilot freeze instantly, and there's also a sequence that involves our main character being chased by a pack of wolves; which would have been interesting if the wolves weren't so obviously CGI. It's not even good CGI, for god's sake. The cast aren't bad, but nobody shines. Jake Gyllenhaal probably wanted a change from doing small independent films, and I can understand that; but he impressed in those films, and he doesn't here. Stick to what you're good at, Jake. Dennis Quaid tries to be the intellectual hero, but misses the mark due to an entirely rigid performance and Ian Holm is the British man that goes out on a tribute to Manchester United. Don't get me wrong, Man U deserve a tribute; but would you really be toasting a football team when you're about to killed? Just another of the film's silly sequences.One day, someone will make a good disaster film. One that doesn't just focus on America, one that takes it's subject material into account and doesn't turn a disaster into a uplifting drama. One that does it's human drama in an interesting way, and one that does what it says on the tin where the disasters are concerned. One day that will happen, but today isn't that day. And neither is The Day After Tomorrow.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Wow,"This movie lived up to my VERY high expectations. It's very well done, great special effects and action scenes, very entertaining, very good characters and it moves at a very good pace. To me, it had everything. I rented it and now I will definitely buy it.I'm especially happy that it didn't turn out to be a cheesy movie like Independence Day, or a stupid idiotic movie like Armageddon. Personally, I found The Day After Tomorrow to be perfect. It was serious, meaning there weren't moments like ""Will Smith lighting a cigar and acting like some cool tough guy in the face of immense danger"". Here, the people take everything seriously. Also, the acting is solid, unlike for example Godzilla were the acting was ridiculous. The special effects are out of this world, with the exception of the cgi wolves that could have been better. But otherwise, I am very happy and relieved how the movie turned out. Highly recommended.P.S: It's also by far the best disaster movie that I've seen.

The end of the world never seemed as photogenic as it seems in this disaster film,"German director Roland Emmerich, who never ceases to search for new ways to destroy New York City, outdoes himself once again in this spectacular epic that took my breath away over and over again just from watching its trailers. Emmerich, who already wreaked havoc across The Big Apple with aliens (Independence Day) and monsters (Godzilla) recruits the biggest villain of them all to cleanse the city of its immoral ground this time around  mother nature itself.When an abrupt global warming occurs, a father (Dennis Quaid - Innerspace, Dragonheart) swears to do anything he can in order to save his beloved son (Jake Gylenhaal - Brokeback Mountain, Donnie Darko), who is stuck in the middle of a damaged NYC. While this little tale might feel touching and cute at times, it's obvious that the main characters of the film are the special f/x that amaze the viewer over and over again.

That way you can spare yourself the worst plot line ever created in a film. Did you know that when the temp is -100 degrees you don't even need to wear gloves? According to the movie the actors have no problem accomplishing this. You would also think that due to the cold weather you would be able to see the breath of the actors. Yet the sets were obviously to warm or the company blew all its funds on the 50 tornado's to add this small detail in. The character development is non existent, so basically you don't care weather anyone survives the storm or not. This movie was a blown out of proportion joke not worth the hype.

Started well then wavered,"The Day After Tomorrow is clichéd beyond belief, ridiculous in huge amounts and full of unnecessary scenes that drag the film. It centres around climatologist Jack Hall (Quaid) who of course predicts the doom of mankind this time (movie scientists in general predictions context) due to global warming. Of course the governments don't listen and in a matter of days the world is in the midst of a new ice age thanks to a global climate shift caused by that pesky old global warming. Now Jack must rescue his son and co from the clutches of the new ice age in New York City. The film actually begins quite well with half decent pacing and plot development. It doesn't waste any time telling us what its about and pretty much gets straight to the point.Films like these are sometimes guilty of trying to sound too intelligent when face it you're around for the special effects.Those effects do not disappoint,for all the film's flaws they are brilliant and they are enjoyable every time the film is viewed. The second half does sort of rid the film of the spectacular effects and focuses much more on the characters. Okay so that isn't so bad right? Well they were quite boring at times although I did enjoy the interaction between Jack and Ian Holm's character and colleagues which was quite entertaining. Apart that it was pretty dull.

cardboard,"The genre doesn't get any less silly as the years go by, that's for sure. This is as bogglingly incredible as POSEIDON ADVENTURE or TOWERING INFERNO or JURASSIC PARK or the director's own INDEPENDENCE DAY. Obviously there's no point in going to any of these movies for insights into human relationships, but Emmerich's work in this respect is more embarrassing than most. There's more characterisation in HALLOWEEN than there is in this movie. This is weird, since there are some very good actors on show. They all but one sink without trace not because of the dominance of special effects but because the parts they are playing are just sooooooo corny. Somehow, Ian Holm manages to keep his head above the rising waters. Maybe a film with amazing special effects has to trade in cardboard cut-outs, but I'm sure that LORD OF THE RINGS managed to avoid it a lot of the time, especially with Gollum. There's nothing remotely resembling the power of that character here. Emmerich is not in Peter Jackson's league, or anywhere near it. There's nothing as scary as Spielberg's T-Rex from JURASSIC PARK. There's nothing very much at all, I'm afraid. Get someone to wake you when NYC gets into cold water, and then go back to sleep again.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
costly piddle,"hmmmm, lets see if that isn't one of most most recent examples of ""we've seen all this before"" then I'm not sure what is. The advert didn't give much away(easily good enough to get the kevs running to their seats) and i suppose we all know why now don't we, nothing to really get people moving to the cinema's in droves to be honest. I mean come on, that ice age breezed over as quickly as it came on, what was all the fuss about in the end, the only person that died was the seemingly foolish president who stayed back at the white house to oversee the coming of doom.

The Day After Tomorrow,"Ronald Emmerich returns after a 4 year hiatus to bring us his next disaster movie, The Day After Tomorrow, a CGI marvel but, like his other films, too clichéd and thin to be taken seriously enough. Now we all know that films such as Independence Day (1996) and Godzilla (1998) aren't designed to be taken seriously  they are the ultimate in ""popcorn"" movies  but audiences are generally not content with a blockbuster anymore unless it shows a little character, or a little plot to pad the film out a bit. Sadly, this is exactly what The Day After Tomorrow lacks.The film starts with Dennis Quaid trying to persuade the world that, unless kept in check, global warming will make the polar ice caps melt and the world would be struck by ""superstorms"" all over. This, needless to say, would be bad. He says it could happen as soon as in 100 years, except he miscalculated somewhat - it'll actually happen in a few days. Just before it all starts his slightly estranged son (Jake Gyllenhaal) flies to New York for a school competition where, unbeknownst to him, is where the centre of one of these superstorms will end up. Then the storms start, and after a quick ""up yours!"" and a ""told you so!"" to the American government, Quaid sets off to New York to get his son out of there. Meanwhile, his son is trapped in the New York Public Library, trying to stay alive long enough for his dad to reach him.And that's it  the plot in, just about, it's entirety. I've summed it up in 150 words. Yet Emmerich has made a 2 hour film stretching this story as far as possible. It's not exactly a bad story or script, and certainly not as clichéd as Independence Day (although it does have its moments, especially where some wolves escape from their cages  guess when they turn up? Just as Jake Gyllenhaal leaves the library and is completely defenceless, of course...), it's just that there's not enough story/plot to fill the time. Of course, this is where the special effects come in, and they certainly do hit you like a tornado hitting LA (wait a sec). There are 3 major set pieces for these effects: the aforementioned LA tornadoes, the flooding of New York, and then the ""superfreeze"" which we see affect both New York and England. And what special effects they are! They may not always be photorealistic, but they are close enough to the real thing to begin worrying when it starts to rain when you leave the cinema. The film has set a new standard for disaster movie effects, and Emmerich has once again proved that he is more than capable of destroying the world whenever he wants to, and in any way he wants to. He is definitely more confident in his destruction than in his characterisation scenes, which to be honest feel heavy and forced, although all the actors do pull off a good job with the script they are given.The best part for me was actually what was lacking  a single man who could save the day. Not even Bill Pullman or Bruce Willis can stop this apocalypse, and this is shown when Dennis Quaid draws a line through the middle of a map of the USA and tells the government quite plainly that no one north of that line (which includes New York) can be saved, and that every one else must be evacuated south, towards Mexico. The film does have an optimistic ending (we see lots of New Yorkers coming out of the buildings they took refuge in when the rescue helicopters arrive), but the implied off-screen death toll is catastrophic, which makes this film feel a tad more real than Emmerich's others, as if this really could happen. The effects are fantastic, the plot spread too thin, but it is still a worthwhile piece of entertainment, and recommended to be seen, even if only once.Rated: 7.5/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

leave your brain at the door,"""The Day After Tomorrow"" is an old-fashioned disaster flick with today's special effects and tells the tale of weather disasters caused by man.

SPECTACULAR,"THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW...Special effects were amazing, especially the tidal wave into New York City, and the plot wasn't as bad as I thought it would be based on what critics have said.Only downside - The wolves (See the film and you'll know what I mean!)Snowstorms in Delhi, hailstones the size of grapefruits in Tokyo, tornadoes ripping apart Los Angeles and the entire northern hemisphere hit by an ice age - Not bad entertainment, but I was quite disappointed that Europe wasn't mentioned at all and we didn't get to see the effects of the ice age on London, Rome, Athens, Berlin, Paris or Moscow.And quite scary also to think this could actually happen one day if we don't change our ways with regards to global warming.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Flawed, yet still enjoyable.","Big scale, Big budget, money no object, special effects extravaganza about a climatologist, Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) who notices that an abrupt, and massive, change of climate about to happen that could destroy the worked as we know it. Hall must try to figure out a way to prepare the world for what is about to happen. He must also get to his teenage son (Jake Gyllenhaal) in New York, which is being taken over by a new ice age.Its cheesy, but surprisingly enjoyable, with frighteningly realistic special effects. The plot may not hold up to close scrutiny but the movie still has enough to keep you interested throughout.From the makers of the 1996 smash hit Independence Day, this film knocks spots off that one, and provides good entertainment for the best part of two hours.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
My stone-cold opinion...,"We all know about Roland Emmerich's uncontrollable desire to destroy the world  New York in particular  by now. After unleashing Roswell'47 aliens (Independence Day) and a giant Japanese salamander (Godzilla) upon NY, Emmerich now finds inspiration in the global warming problems. What if  a sudden new Ice Age presented itself? The basic premise of `The Day after Tomorrow' is much more logical and realistic than Emmerich's previous films, thus therefore the whole disaster takes place in a period of only a week! So far so good I mean, you can't judge a film negatively because it's far fetched. The whole thing may be scientifically unjustified, but it has to remain a little appealing to the audience, no? The dreadfulness of this film lies in the same old, disastrous clichés that keep on getting repeated over and over again. The characters couldn't be more stereotypical and the oppressed sentiment is so fake you'll feel the urge to vomit. Dennis Quaid is the dedicated workaholic who got estranged from his wife and son, but in times of need, he walks thousand of miles through snow in order to save to save his boy. And do you think he'll make it??? It gets worse The quiet, introvert boy heroically saves his girl while the boisterous older colleague sacrifices his own life by cutting the rope. And that poor, poor little cancer patientDo you think they'll be just in time to save him??? If that isn't exaggerated and fake enough, the film ends with a giant moralistic and ethical speech by the brand new President of the U.S of A. Granted, The Day after Tomorrow stuns quite a few times with amazingly impressive bad-weather effects. The professionalism of the special effects department would have been terrific if it weren't for the computer engineered wolves. They look so primitive they belong in a Stephen Sommers movie, actually. The last (positive) comment goes out to young actress Emmy Rossum. She's a beautiful teen actress who obviously has the required talent in her. I hope to see her starring in many (better) films after this. She's much better than most other cast-members, including Dennis Quaid who merely looks like a cheap Harrison Ford clone here. Jake Gyllenhaal  apparently still able to play a 17-year-old adolescent  isn't bad, but modest and intelligent films like his Donnie Darko deserve my respect a lot more than this. If you have nothing better to do with your time (when it's freezing outside or something), The Day after Tomorrow is a fair time-waster. Otherwise, it should just be skipped.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of the best movies ever told on screen.,"I believe this is truly a wonderful movie. Of course you have your obvious reasons (eyecandy) but there is so much more to this movie than lusting over a twenty-three year old Jake Gyllenhaal. This movie has wonderful effects. To think they created all of these places (Tokyo, Scotland, New York City, Washington D.C.) in a little studio is amazing. There is also another reason why this movie is wonderful. How a usually seperated father and son get reunited under horrid conditions and go on an adventure.

Worth going to the big screen,"The effect for this disaster movie should be seen on the big screen.  I love the effects.  The story itself is based on a theory that the ice age is induced by weather pattern changes from the ocean's currents.  Sorry no meteor in this one.  A little sappy and preachy but not the pc rubbish the left coast can create.  The film is some what believable of how the United States would react to a New Ice Age.  The next new world power would be Australia and Argentina if the Northern Hemisphere is wiped out, and everyone moves to Mexico.  This movie follows all the disaster movie's topics such as people learning to adapt and improvise or die.  My guess for ""The Day After Tomorrow"" if my science is right.  Some of the coastal areas would be ok because of the Ocean's ability to absorb the cold.  The US could do some ice blasting and moving and Paint the snow black in order to melt the ice faster and have the sun's rays absorb instead of reflect the heat would help with the battle with the new glacier.  The U S would be the Gulf states and what is left around the Mexican border.  Not a bad movie, one worth watching 7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Roland Emmerich has done better.,"He's done better work. Roland Emmerich is losing his touch as a director of exciting films. The Day After Tomorrow is absolutely awful. His direction is undirected, the actors say the lines but without believable passion. The dialogue is lame and reminiscent of those banal disaster films of the seventies, although the effects in this are excellent. The film is plodding, dialogue is boring and one cliché scene after another with out any of the humour that made Independence Day, formula film that it was, fun and entertaining. Dennis Quaid is uninspired and not believable at all. He just was collecting a pay check. Day After Tomorrow is a big bore, a typical Hollywood piece of big budget junk.

So endlessly forced and yet so endlessly beautiful...great effects!!,"The Day after Tomorrow (2004)Great and terrible.Wow, the effects are amazing, pure and simple. But--hey, look, really, this is such an absurd idea taken this far you have to laugh. And it's quite funny at times, not only when it wants to be (there are some funny one liners) but also in the whole scenario. And at other times it's seriously serious, action-adventure stuff.Of course you can't take any of it seriously, and so you go with the flow here and think the world's weather really could go south in a few days, that helicopters could run into a storm that would freeze the gas in the lines and make them crash, that a series of really pretty and awful tornadoes could wipe out Los Angeles in an hour, and so on. It's great visual stuff, and it's a perfect movie to watch while Hurricane Irene blows past and the trees are shaking their booty.Here's what's great. First, a huge range of scenes of terrifying weather, beautifully depicted. We're talking all kinds of hugely awful disasters, and lots of snow. Second, the acting though routine is vigorous and up to the task of talking over the storm noises and flashing lights. It's all pretty intense, start to finish. Even the Cheney-like vice-president plays his part well. And the idea that people are good is permeated in every scene. There are no looters, no selfish fools, just heroes and beautifully charitable people. It's too much, of course, but it's what you would hope for.What's fun? Lots of stuff. The homeless guy who knows good practical street stuff the rest don't know, the librarians who love books so much, the guys in space (brief but a new look), and all the weathermen who get whacked by flying buses. Okay, not so fun, but it's part of the free-for-all that is this movie. The wolves are amazing.What's wrong? Well, the science is bad, if anyone cares. An example comes right at the beginning when there is a large image of the ocean currents in the Atlantic, and the Gulf Stream is shown going backwards, or so it seems. It gets cold rather fast and rather extremely (150 below Fahrenheit). The hurricanes forming over land (without explanation) are gigantic. New York is abandoned (all 8 million people) except for a handful in said library. And the endless exceptionalism of people doing exactly what they are told they shouldn't do because they just have to. And their flashlights keep working, days later. Lucky.German director Roland Emmerich has a handful of similarly excessive films (like ""Independence Day""), and I think he isn't a bad director. I say this only to point out that he wrote the story and screenplay, too, and that's where the weakness lies, for sure.Maybe this is a test of personality. If you are an optimist, you'll enjoy what's good here, and there are so many terrific scenes you can't help but just look sometimes at the effect and the set design. It's a disaster film, pure and simple.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

When I watched this movie for the first time, and a couple more times after, the topic of the world ending back in 2004 was irrelevant at the time. Nobody believed in it, until this brief storm struck NYC. I've experienced this ""the world ending soon"" feeling during and after the storm. It was a disaster. I immediately thought back to this movie, and I really appreciate the movie now. I felt a strange feeling, a knot in my stomach looking at all the trees down in NYC. It was just a brief storm, but I immediately thought of ""The Day After Tomorrow.""

It's not prophetic at all and even scientists reached a consensus to say that while the science in the film is garbage, they all agreed also that it was an enjoyable thriller.We are of course all aware of the threats about global warming, and there are many who say even modern claims are misleading and the earth is simply going through a cycle but anyway, it's better watching the film now, as global warming is in the forefront of our minds.The effects are good, and it's lovely to see Ian Holm again. All the acting was passably good at worst, and the direction was typical American smulch, but nonetheless engaging and fun. It's great to see Jake Gyllenhaal acting as a schoolboy, and Emmy Rossum being cute. Dennis Quaid is as good as he ever is which in a film like this, he excels.It certainly does not feel like 2 hours at all but it's one of those BIG films you can watch over and over again and never get tired of it.

Finally Jack(Dennis Quaid) saves his son, Sam and the movie has a happy ending. I like this movie because the special-effects are shown in half of the movie.

terrible story and already've been done special effects,"I'm glad I didn't pay to see this. When will they learn a bunch of computer special effects does not make a good movie. The basic plot is a scientist, Quaid, hypothesizes the earth's climate is changing and moving toward an ice age. But he never thought it would happen in a few days.At the beginning, there is a ridiculous scene in which Quaid jumps this chasm to get some metal rods. When he jumps back, he makes it with both feet landing right on the edge. It's beyond silly.Then there is a ridiculous subplot involving Quaid's ex-wife, who is a doctor. All the northern states are being evacuated but she says she will wait with a child who must be transported in an ambulance. And no explanation is given why the kid needs an ambulance; he's not hooked up to some breathing machine. So, you are telling me that kid was the only patient in the hospital that required an ambulance. What about the people in ICU!The other subplot is about Quaid's son, who is in New York City when the severe storm, that can kill people outside because of negative degree weather, strikes. He and some friends find refuge in the public library. A silly out-of-place romance is thrown in between the son and his classmate. But the worst part of all involves a pack of wolves that attack the group of 3 on a ship. 3 of them leave to find medicine for the girl who has cellulitis from a cut the director made sure of showing earlier in the movie. These wolves make their way onto the ship and give a good chase. It makes you laugh.Then Quaid goes with his two buddies to New York to rescue his son. Luckily for him, when the killing temps reach them, they happen to be over some store they can wait it out in. Plus, they must have had an extra warm tent. It was also funny when they mention Mexico letting Americans in because the US forgave all Latin American debt!The tornadoes were the best CGI effects, but tornadoes have been done so many times in other disaster movies. But, they only had one scene of natural disaster in foreign countries unlike movies before it. That's real original! Then the ending was horrible because it just stops with out a real resolution.FINAL VERDICT: This was a bad movie.

Great catastrophe movie,"This is a truly great catastrophe movie. It is a typical Hollywood product, so you have to be tolerant towards the tired reenactment of worn clichés.

Finally, they don't know anything about wolves, but...shrug. It's a very well done movie. It has a perfect dramatic build-up, awesome effects and it does not become too cheesy. I enjoy seeing New York and Los Angeles getting smashed up so much that I have watched it three times already. Another delirious moment is when Mexico closes the border and Us citizens enter Mexico illegally. Finally the movie is a starting point for serious informaton and discussion about global warming and pending disasters.There is one very interesting fact in this movie that I must point out. You have seen in Hollywood movies that cars and helicopters explode if they crash. As seen in this movies, that is not valid for British helicopters. They crash with no explosion, thus making survival possible. I hope that American manufacturers of cars and helicopters will take this fact to their hearts when making new designs.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Too, the story of the father reaching out to his estranged son carries a certain iconic emotional weight that pushes us past some of the illogical choices.Overall, this is the first Big Summer Film I've seen this season that didn't disappoint.

The character development was very limited other than for the three main characters all belonging to the same family. I found that a tad disappointing. It's hard to get really enmeshed in people's lives when you don't know a thing about them. They missed some opportunities here.I found the opening sequence almost nauseating due to the method it was filmed in. The speeding over ice, left me dizzy. Those would be my major gripes but I could recommend the film as a kind of fast food treat.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It's a happy to be B-movie that wraps you up in warm CGI blankets on the coldest day imaginable,"Rolland Emmerich must really have something for New York. I think it's great that he finds an inspiration in the city to have it be the setting for just about every disaster imaginable. Slimy aliens kicked Liberty's ass in ""Independence Day,"" a ferocious lizard ate the big apple in ""Godzilla"" and now Mother Nature herself has turned a cold shoulder to one of America's most recognizable cities. Is Emmerich intentionally trying to remind us of 9/11, or does he hold a reserve that New Yorkers are really so tough they can take anything?Whatever the answer there's still no mercy in a movie like this. The trailers and TV spots alone let us know that walls of water will somehow come crashing through Manhattan and monster snow storms will bury Central Park in flash-freezes that haven't occurred since the last ice age. Dr. Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) is the paleoclimatologist tracking the Arctic ice shelf when he realizes something strange is happening to the planet's climate. He theorizes that life on earth is about to become radically different and spends the first half of the film trying to convince the White House that big things are in our forecast.Since the average audience aren't willing to wait the decades it would actually take to have an ice age occur on a scale like this we have to believe it can occur in a matter of days. While trying to smooth over a rocky marriage Quaid's character calculates that little time is left before the super storms begin to hit. He urges his college-bound son Sam (Jake Gyllenhal) to seek shelter in New York and wait for him.The special effects in this film are astounding and it's somewhat refreshing to have them not just look like good CGI, but to feel and sound like it too.As Quaid's character makes an unlikely jaunt from DC to New York with his arctic gear conveniently available his son makes preparations in the New York library with some other survivors. As is always the case there's not much else to the plot than survival tactics. Characters come into conflict with each other when they can't agree on the best course of action, not because their natures just don't compare. Maybe that would make it slightly more interesting or complicated, but I kept wanting a little more to ponder than just the spectacular effects.Disaster movies can bring a certain inspiration to them if done correctly, I think ""Deep Impact"" was the best recently. You can still have fun if they're just adrenaline fodder like ""Armageddon"". And sometimes they can be just plain ridiculous like ""Twister"". One thing they all require though is at least one thrilling sequence that makes us feel the crunch of time, the ferocity of the elements and the panic of the characters -- of which there's no real shortage in this film. It's a B movie that knows it's a B movie, and at least that makes us accept it and not feel like it wants to be anything else.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Two words: Flaming Pile,"This movie is easily the worst movie I have ever seen. Up until last night, ""Dude Where's My Car"" held the number one position, but then I viewed the sneak peek of ""The Day After Tomorrow"" and I have to hand the title over. This movie lacked so much I don't even know where to begin. The dialog alone was enough to make me scream. I feel that this movie insulted my intelligence, and I am sorry that I wasted two hours of my life on it. I want that time back. The only redeeming quality was when Jake Gyllenhaal took his clothes off. Even that lovely sight was not enough to make this a ""good"" or even ""decent"" movie. I was in agonizing pain through the whole movie because of how bad it was. It literally sucked all of the energy out of my body, and I felt the need to apologize to the friends that I brought with me. There were several points where we almost stood up and walked out.I wish we had. Because we would not have missed a single good thing.

One Of The Greatest Disaster Movies Ever Created,"Roland Emmerich is a very uneven film creator, he can make an outstanding movie with awesome plot and great characters, ansd then he can produce a flop.
The Day After Tomorrow is an impeccable masterpiece where all the numerous elements have come perfectly well together. The cast, with Jake Gyllenhal and Dennis Quade at the lead, with also Emmy Rossum and Ian Holm at the helm, is very well selected. And each actor does a very decent job, with a whole array of deep and convincing characters to add to a bigger picture. What is great, we feel for them, sympathize, sufffer and rejoice with them all the time.
Some critics bashed the scientific side of the plot, and I can say, this is not a scientific moviw, but the message is clear and vivid - albeit also livid - the climate changes very fast and Nature can pay very severely.
The CGI are awesome and we nevr feel fooled or bought cheap, the immense sheer power of wild wanton nature in its fill menacing glory.
The movie is long but bever slow or boring, it hilds you at the edge of your seat without getting too preachy or ploddy.

"Good plot, not as good actors","A enjoyable movie that for the most part gives you the ""judgement-day fear"" doomsday movies often do. But on the negative side, the characters we meet during the film are nor extremely satisfying or realistic, yes there are some good actors, like the little girl with cancer, but for the most part this is where the movie is at it worst. The characters are hollow and the actors doesn't deliver a very convincing job, the movie also has at times very unrealistic and poorly made cgi, you get a more early 2000 felling, not 2011. But the biggest problem in my opinion is definitely the shallow and overdoing on the father and son relationship, it isen't very exciting or emotional and instead uses a lot of screentime where we could instead have had the scary shots of natural damage and backstory witch are definitely the best part of this movie and the only reason it doesn't get any worse rating.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Lame disaster movie,"This has got to be the most lame disaster movie in a decade. The premise of global-warming-leads-to-new-ice-age is ridiculous. And even the actors in the movie respond as if they are just going through the motions of reading lame dialog. It's almost bad enough to be considered a spoof of disaster movies. The only thing worth watching in this film are some of the special effects. The drastic change in weather and tide, shall we say, in NYC is pretty interestingly portrayed. But the results of those same phenoms are unbelievable even in the context of the movie. Does anyone -- even the director -- believe that the Statue of Liberty would still be standing after that? It's insulting to the audience and it pulls the rug out from the rest of the movie. Nothing else has any credibility after that -- even when trying to suspend reality for the sake of enjoying the movie. So the whole movie is lame, lame, lame. And so far as this movie being a ""statement"" about the danger of global warming, it does more to highlight the absurdity of that argument than the opposition could ever achieve.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I give it a big thumbs up for impact, entertainment, and important message.

An interesting remake of Independence Day,"Take out the aliens, replace them with weather.  Take out the multiple massive motherships threatening major cities around the world, replace them with multiple massive storms.  Keep the brainy yet misunderstood main character who's can explain what's going on and what's about to happen but nobody will listen.  Destroy New York and Los Angeles, be sure to wreck only well known buildings.  Keep the totally unrelated romantic subplot.Take the arduous trek from New York to Washington, DC and flip it. Keep the product placement.  Keep the technology, with lots and lots of  monitors. Keep the oval office set, the worst one you can find in Hollywood.  And most importantly, the first rule of summer blockbusters, never kill the dog.Environmentalists hope that this film will at least get people talking about global warming.  Perhaps it will educate a little about the interconnected nature of global climate and the importance of balance.

An Apocalyptic Movie Which Does Justice,"The Day After Tomorrow, while drenched with some of the richest special effects seen since The Lord of the Rings, The Matrix, and Star Wars, is rich in both character depth and plot quality. It is easy to be awed by the movie magic but one must be careful not to overlook the important message imbued within the movie. The political importance of the concern with global warning is an undertone throughout the entire film (in some scenes it is more prevalent) but it does not take away from the grand scope of The Day After Tomorrow. Not since Stephen King's, ""The Stand"" has a movie of global disaster done the genre justice. Movies such as ""Deep Impact"" and ""Armageddon"" fall far short in their attempts to lure the audience in with the promise of a cataclysmic event, only to find that the heroes come through in the eleventh hour to save the world from dire calamity! In The Day After Tomorrow, the heroes do not save the day for everyone in the world, or, more specifically, in the Northern Hemisphere. While there is a bit of stark heroism intertwined with the plot, it is not so trite as to be tacky.

So the global warming issue may be on the exaggerated level, don't let the right-wing fools talk you into avoiding this rollercoaster ride!  If I were to have one complaint it would be that the film is too short and did not show enough actual disaster footage.  The filmmakers could have shown a far more indepth look at what a major pain in the butt evacuating half of the country would be like but they didn't.  It was more of a footnote than a subplot.

Cool disaster scenes with not enough continuity,"In the category of ""disaster"" films, the real attention grabber are chaotic scenes where things are either blown away or demolished. Sure, imagining and actually witnessing a city flooding are two different things, but that's all these films really have to offer. Plus, these kinds of events only happen once. Disaster films normally do not include the main event, and then a second dose of the same thing.This movie actually has a political agenda to it as well. It is easily noted that director Roland Emmerich was picking sides with this. It is clearly stated that Emmerich picked Kenneth Welsh as the vice-president to resemble Dick Cheney from the Bush Administration, and Global Warming, which is the topic of main importance in the plot. Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid), is an engrossed climatologist who has a hard time convincing authorities above him that Earth's climate will change drastically if something isn't done soon. Along with this is the relationship with his son, Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal), whom he's struggling to maintain close to and his wife Sela Ward (Mrs. Hall).And then out of the blue, all the predictions Mr. Hall made came true, but much sooner than he predicted. Eh...like that wasn't expected. A lot of the struggling scenes involve peril and they do keep the viewer on the edge of their seat, but much of it is so predictable. For example, before the disaster even happens, we learn Sam is going on a field trip for the possible reason of a girl being involved. Nothing more needs to be said; we all know where this is going.It's not to bash on the acting. The acting is definitely there. It even contains a few comical moments to relieve the audience from recalling that the main characters are in the middle of a global crisis. But screenwriter Jeff Nachmanoff must have not put much thought into the story at all. Nothing really makes this movie stand out like any of the other disaster films.The background music by Harald Kloser was effective. He made scenes tense and emotional when they had to be. But once again, there wasn't much of a reoccurring theme. If a film and a composer really want to be remembered, there should be a repeating theme. The only other bone I have to pick here is the continuity. There are scenes where they describe how intense and deadly the weather is; yet I see characters walking around in the weather, which was just described, with nothing covering the important parts of their body. Um hello, Mr. Nachmanoff, where are you again?The movie would definitely have the support from Al Gore, but even he wouldn't have much influence on how the film plays out. There are various elements that make it enjoyable but the story is lacking.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Compleatly twisting science, weather and history. I know it's just a movie, but if they wanted to go way overboard why not have the movie take place on another planet.

Nowadays, all we talk is about global warming, hot weather, warm winters, but this movie is something totally different from that, the complete opposite. Yes, the moment when Jake Gyllenhaal is pursued from one city to another by has father, while the whole world is crumbling is a bit to much, but hey, as long is Jake Gyllenhaal is the one we need to worry about, everything is alright, who by the way, does an awesome acting job, altho, at that time, is only 23 years old.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A Dated Yet Thrilling Ride Through Climate Chaos,"Looking back at The Day After Tomorrow from today's perspective, it's easy to point out that the special effects feel a bit dated, and the family drama subplot comes off as somewhat clichéd. However, the film's overall smooth storytelling and its bold, imaginative premise still manage to shine brightly, even two decades later. While it might not be worth carving out a dedicated two-hour slot for, or the first choice for a family movie night, it's undeniably a solid piece of cinema. It has a way of engaging your senses, even if you're not diving deep into its themes or messages.What makes this movie stand out is its ability to balance spectacle with a sense of urgency. The disaster sequences-whether it's the tidal waves engulfing New York or the sudden freeze of the northern hemisphere-are still gripping, even if the CGI doesn't hold up to today's standards. The film's central concept of climate change triggering an abrupt ice age is both thrilling and thought-provoking, even if the science behind it is exaggerated for dramatic effect. It's the kind of movie that doesn't ask you to overthink; instead, it invites you to sit back and let the chaos unfold.That said, the emotional core of the film-the father-son relationship-feels a bit formulaic. The dad's relentless quest to save his son, while heartwarming, doesn't break any new ground in terms of storytelling. Still, it serves its purpose, adding a human element to the otherwise overwhelming scale of destruction. The supporting characters, though not particularly deep, are likable enough to keep you invested in their survival.In the end, The Day After Tomorrow is a testament to the enduring appeal of well-crafted disaster films. It might not be groundbreaking by today's standards, but it's a reminder of how a simple, high-concept idea, executed with confidence, can still entertain. It's the kind of movie you might stumble upon while flipping through channels and end up watching until the end, not because it's a masterpiece, but because it knows how to keep you hooked.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A special effects filled movie,"STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsClimatologist Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) discovers erratic changes on the weather patterns on the climate.It is from here that the earth,finally rebelling against years of abuses from the greenhouse effect and global warming,unleashes a cataclysmic onslaught of hurricanes,floods and other natural disasters before everything freezes over.Hall must try and save his son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) who is trapped over in New York.With a plot that straight-forward and basic,we're already set in motion in terms of where TDAT's priorities lie in terms of what constitutes filmic greatness.Coming from director Roland Emmerich,the man behind that most ultimate of summer blockbuster movies Independence Day,I think we can assume that means (admittently) rather breath-taking,awe-inspiring special effects over such things as plot,which here is really just to serve as a backdrop to give the film meaning,characterization which is woefully perfunctory and leaves you unable to care about any of the characters's fates whatsoever,and script,that just,well,su*ks.The performances don't seem to have had too much investment payed in to them,either.Quaid appears to have transfered some (though thankfully not quite all) of his Cold Creek Manor woodenness to his performance here,which is unappealing,Gyllenhaal is a talented and dynamic young actor here appearing in material which is below his station and which he is obviously only appearing in to raise his profile,whilst Adrian Lester rides on the popularity of his leading role in the recent hit BBC1 drama series Hustle with his role as Scotland based climate station operator Simon.This film,and others like it,are designed to be 'summer blockbusters' and deliver marvelous special effects,and not much else.As far as the plot goes,there is the interesting angle of how if we continue to abuse the planet in such a way,this is what could be waiting for us,but no informative insight is ever offered on this matter and to anyone not taken in by all the publicity surrounding the film,the message will probably just drift by completely unnoticed.By rights,I should give this film the ultimate five stars award.It satisfied me in the only way I expected it to (in terms of the special effects) and satisfied me very well.But it certainly didn't pleasantly surprise me in any way,either.It's the sort of cheesy,cheerfully condescending pap of entertainment that nobody takes seriously in the year 2004.It's just open to parody from comedy movies to be released by Hollywood in the near future (I had to stifle laughs as I sat in the auditorium,as I watched the tidal wave scene as it raced through New York,as I pictured surfers riding along the waves and a loud voice shouting 'waaaa-heeey-heeey,wipeout!!!','da naaa naaaa naaa naa...!!!' plays overhead (amongst other things).)Despite the lack of engaging plot and cardboard characters,I only expected the film to deliver on one level anyway,and on this level,it delivered and it wasn't pizzas.If you are a seasoned connoisseur of films and visit the cinema regularly,you should know exactly what to expect and only have yourself to blame if you expected too much. ***",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

But mostly, like director Roland Emmerich's ""Independence Day"", it's about letting those special effects fly and showing us some crazy stuff.Global warming causes the melting of the ice caps which triggers a huge and devastating climate change on Earth, causing, among other things, cantaloupe-sized hail in Tokyo, tornadoes that tear L.A. apart, and in the film's scariest sequence, a gigantic tidal wave that covers most of New York City. The L.A. and New York scenes feature some truly amazing special effects.Also like ""Independence Day"", it features a large cast, with the characters grouped in different places, enduring different hardships. The only group of characters I found interesting were a teenager named Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal, looking a bit lost in his first big-budget, mainstream film but doing a good job), some of his friends, and some other people trapped in the upper floors of the New York public library.Along with tremendous special effects, ""The Day After Tomorrow"" features great cinematography and a well-done sense of dread in its first half. To see thousands of birds flying south all at once because of something they know and the characters don't is an eerie sight.But oh boy, is it dumb. The dialogue is terrible, and there are many scenes where characters say something and then glare at each other while intense music plays and you half expect the actors to crack up. This is also a movie in which it's possible to outrun cold air (which actually makes for an exciting scene), and where even after New York City has been flooded by a tidal wave, there is still someone behind the information desk in the library to helpfully point out where the nearest phone is.However, the dumbness of ""The Day After Tomorrow"" didn't detract from my enjoyment of it, and in some cases even added to it. Besides, you don't go to a movie like this for character development or dialogue. You go to see some awesome sights, get a few thrills, and you're lucky if just 2 or 3 of the characters are halfway interesting, and on those counts it delivers.This is a big, bold, cheesy theme-park ride of a movie, and if that's all you expect, you won't be disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
See it on the big screen,"Due to many reviews calling this film mediocre, I went into it with lowered expectations. Maybe that was why I ended up enjoying it. Sure, the science is bad, but the effects make for quite a ride. And while the characters are superficial, they're really only there as window dressing. Face it - this movie is all about watching the human world get trashed by Mother Nature. Go see it on the big screen and sit up front, because that's the way to enjoy this sort of film. If you sit in the back or wait for the DVD, it's probably not worth it. I'd compare it favorably with Emmerich's two other big budget disaster films - ""Godzilla"" and ""Independence Day"". The latter film is probably the better comparison. ""Tomorrow"" lacks some of the humor of ""ID4"", but the effects have improved and the plot resolution isn't quite so cheesy. I give ""The Day After Tomorrow"" a 7 on the big screen, but probably only a 4 or 5 otherwise.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Better than the credit people give this,"This film is visually sensational and the acting is decent except some extremities but in a situation as the one depicted in this film, you'd expect extreme behavior.Dennis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhaal do as well as you'd expect, they've never let me down. They could make or break this film, and to be they made it.The story is much more than ""father tries to rescue the world and his son"", it's about the compassion in others, our abuse of natural resources, learning from our mistakes, and our political stance in the world.This is a very humbling film with great visuals and a story so extreme it can't be completely impossible.If you want an easy to down 2 hours, get this film and watch it, just be sure to get it in the best quality possible, you won't be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Heroes Are Among Us,"The movie's been released in my country on May, 27 & I have already watched it two times. In fact, I'm planning to watch it for the third time in the nearest future.I think the movie doesn't deserve a lot of bad reviews given to it by those critics. The direction by Roland Emmerich is literally Oscar-worthy. He's done even greater job here, than with The Independence Day. The visual effects are breathtaking & aesthetically gorgeous, while scary in the same time. The action is complemented perfectly with intense & passionate music, written by Harold Kloser. In fact the movie features the best music score, I've heard recently. The story is credible & dynamic, though some questions could arise.OK, so I've heard some complaints about acting. Indeed, the acting in The Independence Day was better, but in The Day After Tomorrow it's not bad either. Dennis Quaid is believable in portraying determined & strong-willed scientist. The young stars Jake Gyllenhaal & Emmy Rossum are also doing their job quite well. Plus, the movie features a bunch of talented African-American actors! So the acting could be better, but it's no way bad.Others say the movie is too idealistic. Well, that's true. But I think this is a major advantage for the picture, though the viewers, who are getting more & more cynical & livid each year might not appreciate this. The film is promoting very positive ideas: family values, equality of races, unity of nations, morality & kindness. Plus, it's sending a strong message of patriotism. The scene where the survivors are approaching the ice-covered Statue of Liberty even brought tears in my eyes! The film is spiced up with good humour & some original plot twists.The Day After Tomorrow is a film, which is uplifting, inspiring & very patriotic! It's going to show you, that you don't need to kill bad guys with some heavy weapons, while belting out cynical jokes to be a hero. The real heroes are among us & you can be one too, if be kinder to others & do your job well, no matter what.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
shameless environmentalist tripe,"I've been too tired at night lately to watch anything except action flicks. So I got this one after seeing some pretty cool special effects on the preview.If your enjoyment of a movie is derived solely on special effects, this one is pretty good. Every other facet of the production is lacking. The acting is amateur and melodramatic, the plot (if you can call it that) is choppy, and the theme seems entirely centered around environmentalist politics.The politics are especially nauseating. The opening scene depicts the fracture of an ice shelf (a common environmentalist sermon). The movie goes on to present the typical global warming doomsday scenario, except that the doomsday results are squished into a period of days rather than thousands of years. The focal point of the film becomes three ""super hurricanes"" that form over land and suck down huge amounts of lethally cold air from very high in the atmosphere. The final scene of the movie involves an astronaut on the space station remarking how clean the air has become, implying that ""mother nature"" healed herself through the power of these storms.

Most memorable global apocalyptic movie I have seen to date,"*I saw this on the big screen when it was released*Since I saw Alien(1979) as a kid I have always been a Ian Holm fan and it was great to see him in this movie even if it was brief. Combine that with some truly terrifying special fx about the world ecosystem collapsing and great performances all round and you almost get a movie too awesome to fail.I rate this movie up there with 2012 which did have ""cooler"" special fx and was more exciting per se but this movie unwrapped itself in a more psychologically effective way. There was no magic cure at the end, no everything will be alright if you take the pill solution which made the movie's suspense so much more believable.Take it as you want but The Day After Tomorrow has content that might be perceived as a dramatized warning to us all even if it is all hocus pocus with its science.Rated: Memorable and enjoyable from beginning to end and a must see for world apoc junkies.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Anyone for Tahiti?,"ha, well, I gave this crazy new ice-age story a 7/10 for, mainly, the quality put into this film. The story was a little overdone, and I wish that we saw more of what might happen to different countries than our own. This director loves natural disasters and space...whatever relation those have together we never are sure of.Dennis Quaid played an average guy (his specialty), who happened to work for the climate watch for the government, who is out to save his brainy kid (Jake Gyllenhaal) from the perils of the new ice-age coming to sweep what seems to be mostly New York.A depressing and stark reality view of what might happen if New York keeps driving cars...no not really, but you can't help but feel guilty after seeing this. We really don't care if things get this bad like they are in this film, but apparently we're supposed to. Or else the Statue of Liberty gets it! I liked the music, some of the disaster scenes (some were completely predictable), and, again, the quality of the shots involving a lot of stuff happening at once. I DIDN'T like the wolf scene, the hum-drum characters and their reactions to everything, no buildup to anything (except getting away from that damn area), and the ending! The ending was just ""poof"" and everything seemed to be all better within the last 10 minutes! I was quite angry. Well whatever, 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It threatened and promised to be a politically (wooly) mammoth disaster picture.,"Jack Hall is certain that another ice age is imminent due to the effects of global warming, but the government just will not listen to him. Sure enough the climate changes and the world is at threat from perilous frozen weather, worse still for Jack is that his son is trapped in New York City!Roland Emmerich was the perfect choice to direct this particular piece. There is no denying that he has no little panache when it comes to destroying and blowing things up, think Independence Day, Stargate, Universal Soldier and Godzilla. What runs true through an Emmerich picture is that he is great on the CGI money shots and knows how to whet an appetite for destruction. Sadly, what is also true is that his second halves rarely deliver on their promise, so shall it be with The Day After Tomorrow. Even allowing for the expected mawkishness that comes with disaster/survival pictures, this picture relies too much on its contrivances, thus completely losing sight of its eco-conscious heart, something that I'm sure the politically aware Emmerich set out to deliver at the start.Packing his picture with solid and professional performers (led by the always watchable Dennis Quaid as Jack Hall), Emmerich is all too aware that his money shots are what the popcorn masses have chiefly paid to see. Tornados, floods and the subsequent freeze are all excellent moments in the piece, but now, some years later the film has to be called out for being the shallow showcase that it is, in fact the CGI looks unintentionally artificial. It's a missed opportunity to make a blockbuster with an intelligent heart, and sadly Emmerich, either through boredom or ignorance? failed to seal the deal and craft one of the better genre entries.Just about average for the destruction sequences, but very little else to recommend here I'm afraid. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Weather Channel's Ultimate Nightmare,"THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW (2004) *** Dennis Quaid, Jake Gyllenhaal, Emmy Rossum, Sela Ward, Ian Holm, Dash Mihok, Jay O. Sanders, Austin Nichols, Arjay Smith, Tamlyn Tomita, Kenneth Welsh, Perry King, Glenn Plummer. Stupendous special effects are the real stars of this blockbuster disaster flick involving a drastic change in the global weather, which unleashes unnatural activities, and a sudden Ice Age despite warnings from square jawed Quaid's American paleoclimatologist as all hell breaks loose on the world at large. Filmmaker Roland Emmerich  the latter day Irwin Allen of epic f/x laden doomsday thrillers  pulls out all the stops visually (best bits: cataclysmic twisters in LA and a gargantuan tsunamic wall of water heading to Manhattan as Lady Liberty becomes a body surfer of giantess proportions) but his sci-fi batty screenplay collaborated with Jeffrey Nachmanoff offers some stilted dialogue and questionable theories of the end of the world as we know it. The game cast however makes up for the plot holes and again the visuals are nothing short of astounding or original (check out a first: instead of out-running balls of flame, out-running wicked cold fronts that crystallize instant freezing!)",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Average disaster film,"I'll give this to director Roland Emmerich:  he sure knows how to lay waste to major cities.  The Day after Tomorrow is his third round of cinematic mass destruction, following on the heels of an alien invasion in Independence Day and a giant attacking lizard in Godzilla. Of the three, The Day after Tomorrow is probably the most accomplished, but that doesn't necessarily make it a great film, as it moves through most of the standard disaster film clichés without batting an eye, but yet still proves mildly entertaining.Based on the pseudo-science book The Coming Global Superstorm written by radio commentator Art Bell and novelist Whitley Streiber, The Day after Tomorrow opens on an Antarctic ice shelf, where paleoclimatologist Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) and his team are collecting ice core samples when the shelf decides to separate, leaving Hall with an ominous sense of dread.  At a Global Warming conference in New Dehli (where it is snowing), Hall informs those gathered, including the rather unsupportive Vice-President of the United States (Kenneth Welsh), that sometime in the future, the very fabric of our warm climate will collapse and send the planet back into an ice age. Hall is generally ignored by the conference goers, until giant tornadoes begin tearing Los Angeles apart, torrential rains lead to massive flooding in New York City, and in Scotland helicopters, and their occupants, freeze instantly.  Hall determines that his predictions where not only correct, but they occurred well ahead of his believed time-table, and advises the President of the US to evacuate the lower states, while the upper states can only sit out the storm for fear that if they leave their homes, they too will freeze to death.  Meanwhile, Jack's son Sam (Jake Gyllenhall) and several classmates are trapped in the flooding, and then freezing, New York City and Jack sets out to try and save him from what seems certain doom.The Day after Tomorrow follows the rather standard disaster film formula of introducing dire portents of an upcoming tragedy, including a well-meaning scientist who tries to warn others but is viewed as a kook, followed by the beginning of the disaster, along with the sudden realization that what was warned is really happening, and after the bulk of the disaster has passed, then comes the aftermath as people must attempt to save themselves. There isn't a whole lot here to enliven the process beyond the standard, and as such there is little in the film that really takes you by surprise.As with most big disaster films, what really pushes the picture along is it's spectacular scenes of disaster, and in this department The Day after Tomorrow excels, featuring some rather impressive imagery of tornadoes, tidal waves and giant storms.  Probably the strongest material is centered on New York when the city is flooded, which doesn't fail to disappoint in the spectacle department.  However, amazing visual effects doesn't really take the place of an interesting plot, and the Day after Tomorrow doesn't have much to offer once the disaster starts dying down.Acting is generally capable, but no one really stands out.  Dennis Quaid is decent as the obsessive scientist who tries to warn people of the danger, and then must make a personal journey into the unknown to try and save his son.  Jake Gyllenhall is also adequate as Sam, and most of the rest of the cast get the job done, but there are no overwhelming performances. The human cast simply serves the plot.If it sounds like I am very on-the-fence about the Day after Tomorrow, you would be correct.  It is a mildly entertaining popcorn film, but nothing I would whole-heartedly recommend.  If you are interested in impressive scenes of cities being toppled by out of control weather, check it out.  If you are looking for a little more character depth and emotion to go with your disaster, rent Titanic.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Day After Tomorrow Class Review,"The film The Day After Tomorrow was released in 2004 and it stars a lot of big-name actors like Dennis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhaal. The plot is based around a rapid climate shift that leads to the planet going into a new ice age, and how a Climatologist, Dennis Quaid, travels through the storm to rescue his son, Jake Gyllenhall, who is trapped in a library in New York City while the rest of the world is trying to move further South to get away from the storm. I thought that the acting was great and the whole cast played their parts very well but I had a few problems with the accuracy of the weather events that happened in the movie.The first issue I will discuss is how rapidly the climate shifted. While I believe that climate change is real and that the polar ice caps are melting, I do not think that the climate would have changed as fast as the movie portrayed. Climate change is a gradual process that will continue to happen and over the years changes will come, but the changes do not happen overnight. Another weather issue I had was with how they described the ""hurricane"" that formed over Scotland and how the colder water was causing it. Hurricanes do not form over land, they are also powered by warm surface water and they lose power as they go over land so this part of the movie was wrong. The final weather issue I had was with how they made the hail look in the opening scenes. The hail sizes were massive and looked like huge pieces of ice just falling from the sky. I understand that hail can get quite large but in the movie, every piece was way above-average size for hail.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Freezing deadline,"contains spoilerWill our World be freezed in the Future because of nature catastrophics? ""the Day after tomorrow"" shows the effect for the world of our doing. Especially tsunamis, tornados and global cooling are special Parts of the movie. Furthermore a emotional base of the father Jack and his son Sam, which are the characters, explain the dramatic in the film. In other words, the film deals with a problem of the future and shows some be feared effects. With regard to the happening, who is mainly playing in New York, the humans try to safe their Life.To begin with the actors, with the main actor Jack the climatologist, who tries to rescue the world because he notices the global cooling firstly. The film "" the day after tomorrow"" is produced and directed by Roland Emmerich and released in the year 2004 and is a kind of science-fiction disaster. To sum up the happening the film deals with catastrophic effects of global warming in a series of extreme weather. In Addition to that the problem of the global cooling becomes public too late because the government don't want to accept the disaster. Additionaly, the film is based on the roman ""the coming global superstorm"".With regard to the strength of the film, I noticed that the the music was missing and often loud. Besides happening is often exaggerated for example the scene with the helicopter or that the climatologists could sleep in a thin tent while the annoying and cold weather.In contrast to that standing out that the film has a lot of special effects like the ice cracks down or the hailstones flying down. For this reason, the viewer gets a better overview of the problematic situationAbove all, the lights take an important place in the film on account of choosing it you get the dramatic more clear. For example the light in the rooms around and wake up the feeling of danger.In conclusion, Roland Emmerich tries to make contribution in relation to clima change. By using some castastrophics like a frozen big city or a Tsunami. Furthermore he uses a loud backroundmusic and special effects like cracking ice in which the music is too loud and often poor chosen. All in all a successful film, because of the numbered special effects and the dramatic who describes the whole happening.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A dark perspective on what will come next!,"Quite good actually until one point. The action is very intense and until one point there is no dull moment mostly because of the special effects which are very good. You can see that this was a high budget movie but I must say the budget was poorly distributed.As I said, great special effects but a somewhat pathetic ending. After you see a huge storm freezing the entire northern hemisphere you wouldn't expect it to stop as sudden as it began, on the contrary I was very curious to see how they'll survive. But unfortunately it did stop and from that point on you can easily figure out what comes next.On the other hand it gives us some hope that when such a catastrophe actually happens it won't bother us for long( but who knows).Too bad they put so much money in the visual effects department but such a movie should not end after 110 minutes and they could have easily added another 30 min to the action. Maybe it is better this way because otherwise we would have had to endure another 30 min of predictable action.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Movie delivers, story is weak, characterization low","Rating - 9/10, Overall A Good MovieThis movie was rounded off by beautiful special effects and chills and thrills.

Somehow, you slightly, in some way or another, care for the characters.Of course, there are those impossibly dumb moments. The wolves for example.

Forgettable Fun,"My Rating: **1/2 out of ****.Out of all the movies coming out this month, this one looked the most promising. Van Helsing looked simply awful, Troy looked visually fantastic but the reviews weren't very promising, Shrek 2 didn't look terrible but I am not really compelled to see it either(the first Shrek never needed a sequel), and the comedies (Breakin all the Rules, Raising Helen) looked like crap. The Day After Tomorrow looked like it would be the most entertaining of them all.If you've seen the preview, you know what to expect. Now see it on the big screen where it is an awesome sight. It's a huge big budget, disaster film that is typical for summer. For the most part, it entertains(at least when the cities are being destroyed).The special effects in the film are highly impressive. The scenes of L.A. being destroyed by twisters and the flooding of New York City are exciting and look believable. Could you ask for anything more? Well yeah you could.I am very surprised that director, Roland Emmerich (who brought us the very entertaining Independence Day) didn't do more. When this movie was being advertised I saw London frozen over and Sydney about to be flooded. Why weren't these in the film? I mean Emmerich showed the destruction of three cities in Independence Day. Why only two here?The reason more cities should have been destroyed is because outside of the disaster sequences and some of the other action sequences, The Day After Tomorrow gives us some really clichéd and uninteresting drama. The doctor staying behind with the cancer patient(that's really corny and should have been cut). The film also shows us one of the most irritating and moronic Vice President I have ever seen in a film(Why does Emmerich always have to have a politician in his disaster films?).There's also some really lame stuff here. The whole sequence with the wolves attacking on a Russian ship was just plain dumb and it wouldn't have hurt the film if it was cut. In fact, The Day After Tomorrow could have been shorter. Even at a reasonable length(124 minutes), it goes on for too long. Also, they need another closing shot because that last one of earth, though having a point, just comes off rather corny.The Day After Tomorrow accomplishes what it sets out to do: entertain. Emmerich is a competent enough filmmaker to generate excitement, even though he can't create write worth a damn. There isn't much of a story here and the characters are mostly types(although some of the actors such as Jake Gyllenhaal and Emmy Rossum make their characters likable). Good disaster films need characters for us to care about (to a certain extent, Independence Day accomplished this), The Day After Tomorrow comes up short. Nevertheless, I had a pretty good time while watching the film. It's not something that will remain in your memory long, but it's fun while it lasts.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Still a Great Movie,"I watched this 2004 disaster film once again today. If you've never seen it, the gist of the film is that global warming is real, but what no one has factored in is that its effects could happen all at once, taking place rapidly over a period of a few weeks rather than a hundred years or more.To be clear, my understanding from reading scientific reactions to the film is that this scenario is outlandish at best, and I understand why and how some people get tripped up on that. Global warming is a subject that triggers diverse reactions in people, from the passionate voice of those who are concerned for the fate of the planet to the unenthused conspiracy theorist who thinks it's all a sham. Using such subject matter in a way that is scientifically circumspect is sure to draw some angry reactions, with some people upset that the real issues are being distorted and not taken seriously, while others look at the material and see it as Hollywood propaganda. And, in fairness, the film is certainly written as a critical commentary on global warming--a virtual prophetic warning, at that.Whatever the case, if you can get past the outlandish nature of the entire film, the fact is that this is a great movie that has a fascinating plot and amazing special effects. This is a disaster movie extraordinaire, with everything from tidal waves to tornadoes to cargo ships floating through Manhattan.I also have a good appreciation for the acting in the movie. Personally, I find Dennis Quaid to be an excellent lead actor in the film, and it makes me wonder why he's not been cast for lead roles more often. The rest of the cast does a good job, as well. At times the script may feel slightly obvious, but regardless I find the story to be well told. A first time viewer should find the film to be entertaining, if not thrilling. Watch it in HD to get the full experience of the special effects--you won't be sorry.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Good summer stuff,"I don't know why people can't just watch a film and not dissect it. 'The Day After Tomorrow' is a summer blockbuster, not a treatise on the effects of global warming. and as a summer blockbuster, I really enjoyed it. Okay, so the subplot about the kid with cancer was pretty lame, but they had to give the Mum something to do while the Dad went off to save the kid. and as for that - why wouldn't Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) go to save his son (Jake Gyllenhaal)? He has the knowledge of how to protect himself against the elements and has a belief that he can save him.Dennis Quaid is actually pretty good in the film, though I think that it's really made by the subtlety of Gyllenhaal's performance. He manages to be believable as a 17 year old kid who is forced to be heroic, all whilst trying to romance the girl (who might be blind - why didn't she snap him up sooner?).It isn't the best movie ever made, but it certainly isn't the worst.

There was no juxtaposition between the characters and the ensuing apocalypse, meaning that the quest of the climatologist to find his son felt forced and emotionally lacking.In short, a film laden with (pretty good, it has to be said) special effects doesn't cover up for a dreadful screenplay with the emotional depth of an Eminem song.

"Disaster: Big, Bigger, Biggest","I've always wondered if there's an upper limit to the global disaster genre. After nuclear Armageddon, alien invasions, zombie attacks, comet collisions, well, what's left but ecological catastrophe? In the ""really bad weather"" variant of movie house eschatology, the ""Day After Tomorrow"" delivers some terrific globe-as-spooky-ice house visuals, but suffers from the usual disaster movie defect, soapy multi-character story lines which put questions like ""will he get the girl?"" on equal footing with ""will he survive the next ice age?"" The juggle between such disparate tensions can only reassure the audience that however disastrous things may look, they can't be completely hopeless. After all, what fun is global disaster without a little dewy-eyed teen romance? As with most any disaster movie, CGI-enhanced appearances take the upper-hand over reality.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Entertaining,"As you may know, the movie is about the onset of the next Ice Age. Only it happens in about 4 days. The science believability level was better than The Core, although still pretty bad. Things like super cooled air being sucked down and freezing anything within seconds to -100 F and lower. But it wasn't really distracting. The plot was pretty decent as far as disaster movies go, and I got the feeling they purposely made fun of the Bush administration (the president keeps asking the vice president what to do). There was a small part in the movie that was just ludicrous. I don't want to give away anything but it involves wolves, of all things. It was random, completely out of place & didn't add anything to the story. What was really well done were the visuals. The huge storms, tornadoes, walls of water, tankers drifting into flooded Manhattan & more, all extremely well rendered. I always enjoy looking at special effects.This movie was fun to watch just like Armageddon and The Perfect Storm were. Recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Messy Blockbuster,"The Day After Tomorrow is a messy blockbuster. It's a spectacle with formulaic beats, but the film doesn't have a cohesive point (besides destruction). Typical of Roland Emmerich, The Day After Tomorrow follows several characters through a global cataclysm. Massive death is trivialized, vulnerable characters are rushed, and the disaster solves itself without shaping the protagonists. Plus, the science and politics aren't realistic. Lastly, the conclusion lacks falling action. Once the climate event stops, the movie ends without reflection. This is because The Day After Tomorrow had nothing to say. The film's sole purpose was to present weather set-pieces.Meanwhile, Emmerich's mediocre filmmaking continues. Imagery is plain, sound is standard, and music is forgettable. The unimaginative production design lacks tangible craft because it's all sterile CGI. Had the film utilized varied effects, it would've been more impactful. The best scenes use real water and believable hail, but even those are undercut by glossy CGI additions. Finally, the tone is erratic. Cartoonish action doesn't mesh with forced drama. Films are either sincere or not. The Day After Tomorrow tries to have it both ways and contradicts itself. Overall, it's an adequate source of shlock, but The Day After Tomorrow isn't good.Writing: 3/10

"Solid as Ice, Warming with Real Human Emotion and Driven by Sensational Effects","There is a manner to the way Roland Emmerich writes characters and projects their thoughts and notions onto the screen. In a lot of movies the dialogue is over perfect and people say things they wouldn't say in real life.However in 'The Day After Tomorrow' every line of dialogue is incredibly believable and human. The slight awkwardness combined with imperfect shuffling of movement almost makes me want to believe the characters are actually in real life being filmed as a documentary to this fictional disaster.The casting is perfect, with each actor/actress complimenting their well written character, but are all of extremely different ideals and thoughts.What makes this film stand out from other disaster movies is the incredibly variety of effects and the insanity of the situations they are used in, yet although it is far-fetched, they are always presented in a sensible and striking way. Also boosting every scene is an incredible music score.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Highly exciting and instantly forgettable,"Roland Emmerich's The Day after Tomorrow is a surprisingly enjoyable disaster movie romp.  Global warming and polar ice cap melting cause a cataclysmic sudden change in global climate.  Tornados, tidal waves, and temperatures that plummet ten degrees per second mete out chaos worldwide. This allows for some truly spectacular and breathtaking visual effects.  If this is your cup of tea, then make sure you see it on the biggest screen possible with the best sound systems.  This is a true summer blockbuster  highly exciting, and instantly forgettable.Dennis Quiad is the government scientist saying `I told you so' to a Dick Cheneyesque vice president, but as disaster strikes, he undertakes a personal quest to rescue his teenage son, who is trapped in a frozen over New York.  Plotwise, nothing particularly profound happens, but what is worth noting is the political, rather than meteorological climate this film reflects.For a start, the afore-mentioned vice President's character is clearly a metaphor for the current Bush/Cheney administration who failed to sign the Koyoto accord, infuriating environmentalists and many other politicians worldwide.  The science of the film may be bunk (and who cares for goodness sake), but the message is clearly a wrap on the knuckles for the US, and for the most part, takes a slightly subversive tone.Elsewhere, the satire is painted in broad brushstrokes, such as US refugees illegally crossing the Rio Grande to get into Mexico in an attempt to escape the deadly climate.  Another interesting comparison to make is between the set of `token Brit characters' in Independence Day (another Emmerich epic) and this film.  The former, pre-9/11 Brit characters were barely given a line, much less a personality.  However, since we live in post-9/11 `Brits-are-friends-who-help-us-invade-Middle-Eastern-countries' times, the characters contained herein (played by the likes of Ian Holm) are given more to do, funnier lines, and attempts are made to make you care about them before they obligingly perish in true stiff upper lip style.In the end though, The Day after Tomorrow doesn't have anything terribly profound to say about environmentalism or politics.  It's just big, loud, and all-the better for it.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Check this one!,"Supreme silliness doesn't stop The Day After Tomorrow from being lots of fun for connoisseurs of epic-scale disaster flicks. After the blockbuster profits of Independence Day and Godzilla, you can't blame director Roland Emmerich for using global warming as a politically correct excuse for destroying most of the northern hemisphere. Like most of Emmerich's films, this one emphasizes special effects over such lesser priorities as well-drawn characters and plausible plotting, and his dialog (cowritten by Jeffrey Nachmanoff) is so laughably trite that it could be entirely eliminated without harming the movie. It's the spectacle that's important here, not the lame, recycled plot about father and son (Dennis Quaid, Jake Gyllenhaal) who endure an end-of-the-world scenario caused by the effects of global warming. So sit back, relax, and enjoy the awesome visions of tornado-ravaged Los Angeles, blizzards in New Delhi, Japan pummeled by grapefruit-sized hailstones, and Manhattan flooded by swelling oceans and then frozen by the onset of a modern ice age. It's all wildly impressive, and Emmerich obviously doesn't care if the science is flimsy, so why should you?",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Not much to recommend,"If you've seen any disaster movie, I don't reckon you should bother forking out too much money to see this one. It doesn't offer much in the way of innovation.There are some great disaster scenes - a gang of tornados terrorising Los Angeles, helicopters freezing in mid air, monster hailstones in Tokyo and the signature tsunami hitting New York. All these are very entertaining, and enough to keep you watching.Which is very fortunate, because the rest of the plot has almost nothing of interest. You might bide your time between the action scenes by counting the disaster movie cliches in the storyline. There has to be at least a dozen.Another way to make it more fun would be to repeat some of the lines of dialogue and try to make them sound realistic.

Have you understood anything at all?,"There is a movie in which the (possible) dramatic consequences of Global Warming are displayed.The message is simple: If we, and that is especially the U.S., keep on destroying our environment, there is the terrible danger that someday, nature will strike back.In Emmerichs movie, this ""strike"" is a new Ice Age.End of message, end of movie.But: All people here seem to be caring about is how dull the plot was and how insolent it is to bother Americans with such a topic after 9/11.I really feel for the victims of this tragedy, but the essence of the movie is lost is these complaints. Because if some kind of weather crisis would actually someday be happening, it would be far worse than a hundred 9/11s together.It is always simple to escape into dream worlds - but the truth remains out there, and it is not about a quarrel between Liberals and Republicans, but about our future.

Good special effects.,"Saw this on a long-haul flight a couple of weeks back and it was a toss-up between watching it or reading the in-flight magazines. The movie won but only just.The basis of the film is that global warming disrupts the ocean currents and plunges the earth into an ice age. This happens so suddenly that people are stranded and planes crash etc. etc. The rest of the film is about groups of survivors trying to make it back to civilization.Although there were a few good bits, notably the special effects, the film as a whole was fairly tiresome. For a start, the main disaster happens far too early with very little suspense or build-up. Then we're back to the standard formula of assorted groups of people trying to get to wherever they are supposed to be going. The characters are largely unbelievable and the script is totally inane. And how is it when someone has been traveling for days they still look like they're dressed up for a night on the town?The science in this film is really appalling. Nothing wrong with the basic idea of global warming but it's full of physics-defying events that left me groaning with despair. Guess I shouldn't be too surprised by this but this is a film with a real ecological message so to get the facts so wrong won't do the cause any good at all.Well if you treat this as a piece of fun and something to see on a rainy afternoon its OK.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of the better disaster movies...,"""The Day After Tomorrow"" is one of the those type of movies that you can watch every so often, because it is entertaining and has good special effects. Was it predictable as almost every disaster movie is? Yes. Does it go from a dire situation that threaten the world to being honky dory? Yes. But that seems to be a requirement for the disaster genre.The story is about catastrophic climate changes that plunges the world into a new Ice Age, and amidst it all paleoclimatologist Jack Hall sets out to find his son before it is too late.Yep, that was basically the storyline summarized in a single sentence. But what drives the movie are the special effects and the destructive forces of the natural disasters, and also some good enough acting performances.While the movie is corny and predictable to the core, then I come back every couple of years because the movie is entertaining, and the special effects still hold their own by today's standards.If you like disaster movies and not already familiar with this movie, then you should take the time to sit down and watch it, because it is one of the better disaster movies available.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
could have been a lot more,"The earth's climate is change, at a phenomenal rate. From effects of global warming, the earth is unable to take this ever increasing disaster. The counter effect of the global warming is a climate shift to the next ice age. Natural disasters are occurring one after the other; tornadoes, hail storms, relentless rain, all growing in magnitude. Stuck in the middle of it is Jack, who had predicted this change of weather. In New York is Jack's son Sam, on a school trip. Stuck in New York after a giant wave flooded the city, Jack is determined to get Sam out before the city falls to the impending storm.The day after tomorrow is an interesting look at the current weather trends that have been predicted by scientist. At its core there is the message that we have to start looking after our earth or this could be our fate of the future, and it does present this well. The downfall though is that this doesn't elevate itself from the standard disaster film. It has all the clichéd characters and events; iconic monuments being destroyed. The dramatic scenes are over done with no help from the over acting cast. Dennis Quaid is no stranger to over acting, being the main culprit. Jacke Gyllenhaal gives the only good performance, though nowhere near his best.Though this is not an exercise of brilliant acting, its the spectacle of the disasters that take center frame, and they are outstanding. The tornadoes ripping through Los Angelas, the hail storm in Japan, the gigantic wave flooding New York and the eye of the storm instantly freezing everything are amazingly captured by Roland Emmerich. They are so captivating and wonderfully done with the special effects. But though the disaster side of Day after Tomorrow are great, they don't care the slack of the human elements and the plot holes of the story.It isn't the best disaster movie, though it's no where near the worst.

"Good Special Effects, Bad Everything Else","I went to see this movie knowing that the best part would be the visual effects, but I also expected a decent story. Well, I was right about the first part. The only thing that makes this film watchable are the visual effects. Everything else is below average.Thai main message of the film (that we don't treat nature as we should and nature will find a way to correct that) is left totally undeveloped and by the end of the film it seems more like an impossibility rather than something that could actually happen if we are not careful. The ecological, political and ethical messages of the film are somewhat naive and instead of adding to the film they detract from it. And the fact that the father and son story takes first place in the film is not good at all.The film tries to talk about many things at the same time and fails every time. But it is not successful as an action film either. While some scenes (like the flooding of NY City) are spectacular and create some tension, the rest of the film just has too many problems. For example, I could not feel the threat of the climate changes because even though they threatened the entire world, all we saw was the destruction of LA and NYC. And the end was just terrible.

If not for the stupid war and the slinking economy Bush's environmental policy would be #1 on my list for why I'd not (and didn't in 2000) vote for him.But this movie stinks of agenda: the dolt Vice President in the film might as well be Dick Cheney: the super storms only occur in the Northern Hemisphere (i.e. the realm of Western Civilization); the glaciers reach down to the 30th degree latitude (the ice reaches down to northern Texas and Florida, and all of Italy) which cannot happen but serves a political argument. Which is really what this film is, a political argument.Emmerich is trying to say that mankind cannot continue on our course of unabated consumption and abuse of the environment we live in; which is true, nature does balance itself with impunity. But how he illustrates it isn't the truth and a total exaggeration. The tornados chewing up L.A.? I guess giant tornados destroying skyscrapers is more memorable than cornfields in Nebraska. Rabid animals? Yes, we get the point Emmerich - nature is kicking butt and taking names. It was the speech at the end about the 3rd World that Emmerich was laying it on the thickest though.A movie like this doesn't help the environmental movement. It twists science, blows things completely out of proportion. It doesn't reach out to the people it needs to reach out to. Environmental aficionados will see this movie and feel somewhat pleased, but everyone else will see it as bordering on the realm of absurdity or silliness and leave the theater feeling entertained (but none the more aware of the problems facing humanity at present) or angry.I give this movie a 6 out of 10 for ambition, special effects (atypical Emmerich destruction fest) and the father/son subplot.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Clears your schedule,"Whether you want to call him dependable or predictable, once you've seen one Emmerich movie(particularly the disaster flicks), you've, to an extent, seen 'em all. Unless it's the first of his you watch or you expect him to surprise you, you can't really blame him if you wind up disappointed. He at least casts different actors in them, and the performances in this one are actually quite good, with fairly few exceptions. The effects are excellent, and this is rather exciting and entertaining, if you allow yourself to be captivated by it. By the time of the second half, logic goes out the window at such a rate that they knock down the entire wall to accommodate it(it never gets downright boring, though). Everything leading up to that point is largely credible enough, apart from the time-frame. The characters are reasonably well-written, and the ones there for comic relief aren't as irritating as they are in many other blockbusters. Humor varies in quality, but while a bunch of it falls flat, it doesn't really try too hard. The moral is marvelous, and relatively well-delivered(I'm not referring to the environmentalist one... that one's got all the subtlety of a sledgehammer to the face). Editing and cinematography are great, and this tends to get the reaction shots and the human moments in-between all the loud crashes and whatnot, so that we experience what is going on, instead of merely witnessing it.

The title tells you when you need to see it,"A redundant and obnoxious adaptation of the pertinent documentary by Al Gore into a fiction movie.With an excruciating cast of humans getting in the way of our set pieces, the ironies of its plot are laid on with a terrible smugness while the makers clearly just want to exploit a topical issue to disguise what is another lazily written action adventure with even more lazily written personal dramas desperately shoe horned in.These environmental set pieces, once they come, are captivating and there is more than a couple of effective moments partly thanks to its droning score backing the dramatic reading of science equipment.It's also occasionally rather drole: ""He was NOT a chauvinistic pig!""",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Why still care at the verge of human extinction?,"When the erratic climate is in the course of wiping out the entire Northern hemisphere, do I still care to see a man WALKING from D.C. to N.Y. so as to check out IF his son is dead?Do I still care to see the puppy love and kisses between two American high school kids, when the entire Europe is under 15 feet of ice?This film has started with a good idea and mouth-watering CGs. It can probably go on to explore issues like religion, human migration to third world countries, changes to mankind, the helplessness of human being, but..................Funny to see the Hollywood sign being shredded.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A true summer film that doesn't promise more than it offers,"Whenever you go to see a Roland Emmerich film, you know what to expect and at what level to set your expectations.  Whether it was Stargate, Independence Day or Godzilla you know that you will leave the theatre remembering the destruction and special effects, but one day later, you will hardly remember a characters name, any dialogue or even any of the side plots that are always thrown in to get the movie to a two-hour screening.Roland's latest feature is the disaster flick The Day After Tomorrow which stars veteran actor Dennis Quaid as a climatologist who first identifies and then stands back in horror at the effects of global warming on the earth's environment.Of course one can't say the effects of global warming on the earth's environment' in an Emmerich film without expecting buildings to tumble, cars to fly in the air and the sheer destruction of a major American city.  On this level, The Day After Tomorrow fulfills its destiny handsomely.You will no doubt have seen many of the advertisements for the film in trailers or on television spots over the past few weeks.  The ads show a giant tidal wave hitting New York, tornados in Los Angeles and the aftermath of the storm, a snowed in and frozen Statue of Liberty.  Like most of Roland's films, the best scenes are always in the trailers and are just drawn out longer in the screen version.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing. I just want everyone to remember that they should not expect to see anything of a spectacular sort that hasn't already whetted your appetite enough to get you to buy a ticket in the first place.The Day After Tomorrow does boast some incredible visuals.  It has been only 8 years since Twister rumbled our theatre seats, but TDAT perfects the tornado devastation scene.  When multiple funnels appear in Los Angeles, they glide with ease through streets and buildings leaving absolute chaos in their wake without the needless humor of any flying cows.  And when a giant wave hits Manhattan, the special effects crew of 1999's Deep Impact probably even bowed in appreciation.For its two hour running time, what may surprise you is how quickly the time goes by.  The weather anomalies happen about 45 minutes into the film and the rest of the movie surrounds a group of New Yorkers trying to survive and the Dennis Quaid character trying to get from Washington to New York to help rescue his son.  There are a few other plot points including a female that needs medicine, one of Quaid's entourage that sacrifices himself for the good of the team and a temperature drop that will kill anyone exposed to the conditions in less than 30 seconds.But we don't really care about all that stuff do we?  If someone met you at the work water cooler on Monday and asked you how was the movie, I doubt you would ramble on about how Sam really wanted to tell Laura that he is in love with her.What we do care about is the attention given to the effects.  The bang for the buck.  And for the record, there is bang.  Lots of it.  The Day After Tomorrow takes the disaster film playbook and makes sure it hits every note. Other than the obvious Twister and Deep Impact similarities, you will also find takes on The Poseidon Adventure and even 1974's Earthquake if you were unlucky enough to remember it.But I have to hand it to Roland, for all the unoriginal thought, he has produced an enjoyable summer movie.  You don't really connect with any of the characters, but he doesn't give them any ridiculous dialogue either and that, I consider a saw-off.  There is the stereotypical authoritative figures that refuse to listen to the climatologists before things get out of hand, and a who cares (sorry) story about a young patient in a hospital that has been left behind by the evacuation of the city, but since these are not pressure plot points, it really doesn't impact my review of the film whatsoever.The Day After Tomorrow is really critic proof.  Whether I or Ebert or any of the number of editorial snobs like the film or not is not going to affect the turnout on opening weekend and throughout the films' international run. We are far enough removed from September 11, 2001 that we can now see buildings falling and being destroyed again, and thank God there is someone like Roland to give us what we want.So I give The Day After Tomorrow a reasonable recommendation.  You will remember the action sequences, but by the day after tomorrow you will be hard pressed to remember anything else, and isn't that what summer films are for?www.gregsrants.com",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Almost good,"If it were not for a certain naïveté in the treatment of the story, a few inaccuracies and some improbable human exploits, this movie would be a good one. But it reaches almost that stage because the excellent images chiefly the appalling ones that show the storm breaking out upon the urban scenery and the people and the incisive cut of sequences developing themselves in several different places add to its credit. And last but not least the strong message conveyed by the movie as a warning to what can happen if mankind goes on wasting and damaging natural resources and the global climate. Of course we know that such a dramatic catastrophe could not occur in a few hours as the movie shows. But that is purely symbolic and irrelevant. The important is the impact those powerful images have in our minds; of course the movie could not narrate with such impact a process developing itself in years, months or even weeks. The sentimental story narrated along the movie integrates it well and combines itself adequately with its general atmosphere. One last word for some well presented secondary characters. I mention for instance the tramp with his dog caught like all the other people in the middle of the tragedy and the two workmates of the scientist who chose to stay with him in his dangerous exploit instead of looking for a safe place for themselves. Well in fact in this movie all people are good. There are no villains.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fascinating Movie,"I went and saw this movie today with my dad going in thinking it would be pretty mediocre, but it at least surpassed what I thought it would be.My personal favorite actor Jake Gyllenhaal gave a nice performance as Sam, who, along with a few others, is trying to survive in the central library in New York City, until his father can get to him, hiking from Philadelphia to New York City.This movie has a nice plot that leaves you thinking ""Could this really happen?"" and has nice special effects, also.I'd recommend it if you're a fan of special effects, or are interested in global warming. Or hell, even if you're interested in seeing a nice movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Special effects extravaganza marred by doomsday politics,"The typical disaster movie plays up our deepest fears and tries to balance them with human drama. At one minute people are running for their lives, the next they're cowered together, trying to outlast Mother Nature's fury.The elements are usually in place for a good story, but filmmakers tend to overdo the human aspects and end up making the movie melodramatic. ""The Day After Tomorrow"" is certainly no exception, but thankfully the ultra-goofy dialogue that sunk NBC's recent disaster telepic ""10.5"" is mercifully kept to a minimum. Instead we have just a big, dumb action movie that's easy on the brain and filled with lots of visual treats.Nature is a harsh mistress, and it seems she had enough of our selfishness. Scientist Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) specializes in studying the climate patterns of the Earth, and has detected what might be the first traces of a major shift in the temperature of the planet due to global warming. His statements are of course met with skepticism by the American government, particularly by Vice-President Becker (Kenneth Welsh, who looks too much like Dick Cheney for it to be a coincidence).Hall gets a sympathetic listener in Terry Rapson (Ian Holm) a fellow climatologist studying ocean temperatures. When his ominous warnings start to come true, Hall is forced to accept that the world may be heading for another ice age. Meanwhile, Hall's son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) is in New York at an academic competition, which is in the path of a massive tidal wave that threatens to flood the city.""The Day After Tomorrow"" is certainly loaded with some powerful images. Tornadoes destroy downtown Los Angeles, waters flood New York and then the city becomes a frozen tundra, and in one deliciously ironic moment thousands of Americans illegally cross the Rio Grande to sneak into Mexico.It is a well-intentioned film, but like all ""message-driven"" movies its reasoning is absolute and the main characters are either fall into two camps: the noble idealists and the cynical curmudgeons.It's been six years since the last time director Roland Emmerich destroyed New York, and kudos to him for managing to do it again with flare. He directs the disaster scenes with a seasoned professionalism, making them both intense and frightening, and he thankfully manages to downplay the melodrama so it doesn't come off annoying.Quaid is the anchor that keeps this film together, and his performance as Hall is nicely even-keeled. He manages to almost make the conflict in this film believable, but he's still saddled with goofy emotional baggage. His estrangement with his son (a typical plot device in disaster films) is too ill-conceived and by-the-books to be powerful, as is the `heartwarming' decision of his wife (Sela Ward) to stay behind with a young cancer patient in the middle of a blizzard.Gyllenhaal turns in a nice performance as Sam, playing the survivor who, to the screenplay's credit, manages to use reason instead of self-righteous bullheadedness, though he still does a few stupid things as well. It's still a nice star turn for the young actor, and he pulls it off without insulting our intelligence too bad.But ""The Day After Tomorrow"" ultimately suffers from the major problems evident in the disaster genre. Its politics are goofy, the special effects outweigh the human drama and most notably its views on social Darwinism are hypocritical at best.The movie suggests mankind should just accept that in catastrophes there's going to be massive casualties that people can do nothing to stop, but at the same time every attempt by the heroes to save the ones they care about, no matter how foolish a long shot it may be, is always smiled upon. Only in a disaster movie could a selfish decision such as leaving behind millions of people who need your help to seek out one's son be construed as altruistic and noble.The science of the film is of course far-fetched to say the least, suggesting a major world-wide climate change could occur within a few weeks. The fact is global warming still remains a touchy subject, one that can either be proven or disproven with different data. Plus it's always disheartening to see a movie use a straw man approach to discredit opposing viewpoints on the issue by making them come from the mouths of people driven by that dependable goal of every movie villain -- money.""The Day After Tomorrow"" comes with controversy already built on the issue of global warming, but it's doubtful this movie will change many opinions. It certainly is a well made film with great special effects and likable main characters, but like all disaster movies it tries to scare people into submission. You better change your ways, or THIS could happen to you.Still, despite the shortcomings of the film itself, it is an powerful reminder that no matter what your thoughts on the greenhouse effect, the fact remains that mankind is completely at the mercy of nature. It's sobering to be reminded that despite our advances throughout the centuries, at any moment disaster can strike and render all our accomplishments moot.7 out of 10 stars. The movie is good for what it is, but please, less complaining about the evils of technology only to use that same technology when the survivors need it.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Special Effects 1  Story 0,"Shortly after the movie began, a person near me gave a loud yawn. Later, he gave many more. What in the early stages I viewed as impolite and annoying, later I felt was an apt commentary on one of the worst films I have seen in a theatre. The over-the-top political commentary even insulted my liberal tendencies, and the constantly required leaps of faith demanded of the audience made Dennis Quaid's early leap across the crevasse seem like skipping over a crack in a sidewalk. It appears that this was a B+ level cast looking for a fast buck with little exertion (Emily Rossum goes from ""Songcatcher"" and ""Mystic River"" to this?!?!?). Only see this in a cheap movie theatre for the special effects. If you pay full price, get a receipt so that you can tell the IRS you made a charitable contribution to the Home for the Cinematically Clueless.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
personal opinion,"Every one has their personal opinion about a movie but i think this one has the most different personal opinions. First of all, some would not be aware of the many things you consider in every movie. Like the dedicated parents, the stupid politicians, the all knowing scientist. The next thing is the message. Its about global warming, thats for shore but i don't think this movie is made to warn rater just to entertain, while other may think about global warming. The next thing are the special effects. They're good, they're really good and its worth seeing them but as they are the most important thing in this 'catastrophe' movie, they're not in the middle of attention. The acting is the ordinary one and please, i did it, but you don't do it - don't go read the 'goofs' section, there are a lot of goofs in the movie that will kinda spoil the reality of the situations. All in one, the movie is pure entertainment fiction full of new thing and things you see all the time, its not made to warn people of the impact of global warming. Watch it for the thrill, not the message.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Ludicrous but enjoyable,"This movie is mainly fun for the disaster scenes, the tornadoes ripping through L. A. in particular was a great scene. The science isn't there, but that's not a deal breaker.

Run For Your Lives!  It's Another Mammoth Disaster Film--and Fun!,"I read in one review of this film that only a stoned teenager could have enjoyed this film. Being neither, I take exception, realizing first of all that this is not Oscar bait--it's a mammoth disaster film, and everyone who plans to see it knows they are going to see things destroyed, the planet on the edge of collapse--and this film does a bang-up job of showing that.Of course the plot is cheesy--ever seen Earthquake or The Towering Inferno? Of course the characters are cardboard cutouts--this isn't African Queen or Brokeback Mountain--it's a Roland Emmerich film--remember Independence Day? Things are going to get blown up!!! The disaster film fan is given the promise, as the special effects in this fast-paced adventure are epic: the twisters through LA are spectacular effects, and the tidal washes through great cities are amazing work. Why are Quaid and Gyllenhall and Rossum in this? How about big paychecks? It's a disaster movie--you don't get on a roller coaster to cruise along as if you were in a new BMV. I had a good, zippy ride and look forward to another Saturday afternoon when I need a repeat fix--and a double order of buttered popcorn!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
