A love letter to a film industry that is no longer recognisable.,"It took Quentin Tarantino a lifetime of living, 5 years to write and a 2 hours 41 minutes watch. This is a love letter to a film industry that is no longer recognisable. Hippies, short skirts, westerns..... all have disappeared from our movie world. But worry not, Quentin Tarantino is here to remind us of old school film making from a once beloved industry which has been described as being on life support.The performances are flawless. I was apprehensive about how the events of August 8, 1969 would be handled. But that is handled tastefully and respectfully, yet with the classic Tarantino flair.Will be quite a bit for those under 40 who have no recollection of this Hollywood. Some will categorise this as an over indulgent nostalgia trip for movie geeks. And they are likely to be correct. But for those of us who complain that Hollywood is reduced to remakes and comic book films, QT delivers a unique and creative viewing experience.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Bruce Lee vs Brad Pitt,"Not one of Tarantino's best. But still a pretty damn good and smart movie with cool sequences, great acting and directing, music and scenes that will stay with you long after the movie and you would love to watch again.
Loved the combo Pitt-DiCaprio but loved more seeing some famous characters in this film such as Steve Mcqueen and Bruce Lee, who are absolutely hilarious in the movie!

The Manson story in a parallel universe.,"I loved both the acting and the story. Brad Pitt shows a maturity playing ""The old guy"", and DiCaprio is spot on as the self absorbed, insecure fading star. The ending is classic Tarentino with a twist that caught me totally by surprise. I will watch this movie again. Loved it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Tarantino just created a new genre of film,"I don't typically leave IMDb reviews but this film deserves so much praise for its risky screenplay in such a dark true crime setting.For 2 hrs, 41 minutes, I was taken 50 years back, experiencing Hollywood's film industry as a comedic drama filled with desire, tension and everyday life.I liked Brad's character the most, but Leo easily matched with his own performance. A definite see-it-in-theatres watch. Bring your sense of humor though. There are lines of dialogue and laugh out loud bits that completely satisfy your curious mind. Expect everything you would from Tarantino, but also what you wouldn't.I gave it a perfect 10 because I forgot I was watching a nearly 3 hour film, even though it still wasn't long enough for me. I would like to see a director's cut up to an hour longer as I think this is a unique case that extra footage would only help such an already powerful story.I had the privilege to watch an early 70mm screening of this film at the cinerama dome with the director, Tarantino, in the audience. It was a surreal experience I'll never forget.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Visually compelling tribute to tinsel town,Tarantino's ninth film is a homage to the tinsel town and all the major events that shaped its history told in a way that we wished it should have happened . It doesn't offer much of a storytelling but it sure will catch your eye as well as your heart.A must watch for all movie lovers who love and has a special place for the art of cinema in their hearts.,7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
This film will certainly divide audiences,"Another great Tarantino film, though I do agree there are times where it feels a little indulgent and meandering. The climax of the film is fantastic though, and it does make it feel like it was all worth it for the most part. There isn't really a defined narrative, which may put some people off but Tarantino's sublime dialogue and the great performances make all of the scenes at least entertaining. It's no Pulp Fiction, but it definitely is one of the most original films I've seen in a while.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,"Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood is maybe proof that Quentin Tarantino ranks alongside Stanley Kubrick. Both started to make overlong movies and were lionised by critics, many who were afraid to be critical of them.This might be Tarantino's most self indulgent film so far despite being a glorious period piece.Set in Los Angeles 1969. The film is an alternate history as it focuses on Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) who was once a star of the hit television show Bounty Law. Now Dalton's career is fading. He drinks too much, he does not remember his lines and his regular work is guest starring as the villain of the week.Accompanying Dalton is his stunt double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) who acts as his driver and gofer. Booth is also short of work as he has a bad reputation in the stunt industry.Living next door to Dalton in LA is actress Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) who has just moved in with her director husband Roman Polanski. Life for her is attending parties and going to the cinema to see her latest movie.Dalton wonders if he should take up a suggestion to go and work in Italy and make spaghetti westerns which could kick start his career. Booth gave a pretty hippy a lift to a ranch which is full of strange people belonging to a cult. Booth seemed to have rubbed them up the wrong way.Eventually the various people cross paths in this reimagining of what might have happened on a fateful night in 1969.There is no doubt that that DiCaprio and Pitt give their all in this film as two middle aged men fading away at an uncertain time. Tarantino seems to have given this film a conservative hue, he really dislikes the counterculture. I wonder if he is angry with the #metoo movement which destroyed his friend Harvey Weinstein and raised questions over his own conduct in the past.Clocking in at under 3 hours this film meanders until it reaches its explosive climax. Until then you wonder what exactly is the story. The movie is a series of vignettes that hints at a director/screenwriter who is past his prime and seems to be obsessed with bare feet.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
1969 Never Looked So Good,"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a film that is aesthetically appealing from start to finish. Quentin Tarantino's interpretation of 1969 Hollywood is a lush world with superb detail. This movie serves as a love letter to the place Tarantino presumably grew up with.The cast features an All Star ensemble of actors. Whether supporting or main, every character in this film is portrayed with excellence. Leonardo DiCaprio continues to flex his acting prowess in his portrayal of Rick Dalton. DiCaprio's Rick Dalton is a classic take on the waning career of a once successful actor. His emotion as Rick Dalton is felt in a comical and rewarding sense. His anguish is felt prominently within this film. DiCaprio continues to be brilliant. Margot Robbie's portrayal of Sharon Tate is graceful and wholesome. Robbie's ability to emote with facials alone is true talent. Her on screen presence grants the film and audience with a sense of euphoria. Brad Pitt's character of Cliff Booth is a bad ass in every aspect. His portrayal of the character is presented with an enduring chip on the shoulder. When Cliff Booth is on screen, the film is given security. Pitt continues to exhibit why he is a name that should always be in the discussion of great actors. Pitt's chemistry with DiCaprio's Rick Dalton is excellent. Both men play off each other in a manner that makes you believe they are best friends in real life. On rare occasions will you get a chemistry more authentic than this. Rick and Cliff mirror that of Abbott and Costello, or Batman and Robin. Both men were made for these roles and are symbiotic to one another.The dialogue in this film is up to par with the rest of Tarantino's filmography. Every word feels natural, and every encounter is perfect. Tarantino continues his streak of quotable One liners. Tarantino does an excellent job of flexing his knowledge of 1969 Hollywood within his dialogue and writing. The film is masterfully paced as well. The flashbacks don't step on the present story and they add incredible depth to an ever growing tale. The film is slow paced in that it adds background and detail to the characters and the world they live in. There are minor points of foreshadowing that tie in perfectly to the overall story. The payoff to this story is incredibly satisfying and unexpected. Tarantino is a master in storytelling at this point in his career.The film is shot beautifully. Every shot matters and serves a purpose. Tarantino exhibits his appreciation for 1969 Hollywood through long shots of beautiful scenery and diegetic sound. Tarantino's angling of the camera is natural, serving as a film student's wet dream. Once again, the world is incredibly lush. The soundtrack exhibits some of the best usage of music in recent cinema. At times the film feels like a big music video, however this does not take away from anything within the film. The music serves as the mascot for Tarantino's 1969 Hollywood. The music and the setting of 1969 Hollywood are inseparable.Overall, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is another masterpiece in Quentin Tarantino's filmography. Whereas Pulp Fiction excels in storytelling and dialogue, this film excels in storytelling and cinematography. 1969 never looked so good.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Longer than it needed to be (and not in a good way),"This is a tricky one. The acting is superb trhoughout. DiCaprio does himself proud, as does Pitt. It's shot well, it's incredibly nostalgic, but I can't help feel it's missing something. The last 30 mins are ace - that's where the positive reviews are kept. Tarintino does what he does best in that last half hour. It's a shame it took two hours to get there. More time developing the final storyline and less nostalgia would probably have led to a better experience. Or tell the same story in 90 minutes. The soundtrack was ace - pure sixties.All in all, go see it, but go for a wee first.Plot 3/10

Pains me to write this,"I LOVE QT films and couldn't see this movie fast enough. All I can say is what was that all about? It was so boring. Did anyone edit this film? Leonardo's character was not likable. The only person tolerable was Brad Pitt. Nothing happened what so ever. The dialogue was not clever. The movie never went anywhere at all. It was just endless scenes of other movies being made. People driving in cars. Bare feet over kill. By the time the ending happened I didn't care anymore. I wanted to LOVE this movie, but I haven't been this bored in a long long time. I wish i felt differently.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Either the Worst or the Best Film...,"Before watching this film, it is CRITICAL that you have somewhat of a knowledge about Charles Manson (and Sharron Tate). If I did not have my sister next to me pointing out the small references to this serial killer's story, I would not have understood at least 80% of the movie. Understanding the significant details adds a specific intensity in every other scene, like you know something that the characters don't, and always keeps your eyes glued to the screen.Although I can see how a few scenes were fairly slow, and the middle was not particularly engaging, Tarantino definitely had a purpose for each scene, even if I don't have all the answers. Even the smallest of details, like a gun holster of beer or the way the characters drive down the highway, reveals hidden thoughts, feelings, and backstories to the audience. If you do not catch onto these specific details, I can understand how some points seem overindulgent of ""the golden age"" of Hollywood. But the beautifully nostalgic filming in these moments is what makes this film not only entertaining, but a piece of art.It's the juxtaposition of Sharron and Dalton's storyline, it's the wonder and the dimensional characters, it's the brilliant manipulation of the audience's emotions, causing you to laugh, scream, and cry (sometimes simultaneously) that makes this film utterly perfect.The ending leaves you wondering ""What if..."" over and over again, questioning what reality would look like if these fictional characters of Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth actually existed. And I think that's when I realized how perfect the title was: it's a humorous, fairy-tale (although not completely violent-free) ending to the tragic fate of Hollywood in the 60s...",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
California Dreaming.,"There may never be another filmmaker like Quentin Tarantino. If there is, we surely are in luck. But in all likelihood, future generations will just be students of his, and thank God for that fact alone. He's a filmmaker's filmmaker. His love of cinema verges on fetishism. His mission in life, it seems, was to keep his celluloid memories alive and in the American psyche in a time long past it's expiration date. So long as there's a reel and a way, Tarantino will give you a ticket to the greatest shows on earth, filled with filthy language and splattering gore violence. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is his 9th feature film. It's been announced as his second to last film. Rumor has it, if the film basks in an exponentially warm reception, this could be his last film. I pray we can all sit down one last time for the number 10, but if Quentin is seriously considering it, I'll warmly and happily accept that. The truth is, it's all been leading up to this moment. Quentin's personal crescendo, encapsulating all he has learned and all he has experienced as a man living in Hollywood and a successful filmmaker from within it. He went for it, and he did it. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is the best film of 2019, and easily his best film since Pulp Fiction. For me, nothing short of perfect. Everything I wanted it to be, and yet it still shocked and surprised me. I'm convinced that after the second and even third viewings, i'll still find new things to love about it. For nearly three hours in length, it grabs you up from your seat and never lets go.Here's the story. The year is 1969. We meet the dashing Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his frisky stuntman sidekick, Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt). The dynamic duo of black and white television, and old, gunslinging cowboy movies. They were the best, they were the most handsome and they were the most talented. They were the best actors in Hollywood.. until now. After an unkindly meeting with his agent, Marvin Schwartz (played in outrageous fashion by the great Al Pacino), Rick is told in no uncertain terms that his time as a leading man is over. In other words, he's lost everything. Reduced to playing walk-on roles in late-60's TV shows, and B-grade Italian spaghetti westerns that nobody will ever see. Devastated, he returns to sulk in his luxury home in the Hollywood hills, while Cliff goes home to a dingy trailer next-door to a drive-in movie theater, to feed his loyal pit-bull Brandy. California Dreaming is not all that it seems. But wouldn't you know it, Rick Dalton has a new neighbor. One Roman Polanksi and his wife, superstar Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie). The contrast doesn't get much starker. As Rick Dalton disappears into the hazy California sunset, Tate and friends are dancing in the middle of it. We begin to alternate between these two stories. Rick Dalton's personal misery in landing mediocre roles, and Sharon Tate humbly enjoying her career at it's peak. She's so humble, in fact, she attends screenings of her own movies in town to kick her feet back and laugh with the audience. But in the middle of the high and hard times of show business, evil lurks in the background, ready to attack. That evil being the Manson family. Cliff, Rick and Sharon all have individual run-ins with Charlie and the gang, dismissing them as your average dirty hippies, not realizing they are all about to make a head-on collision with Helter Skelter.From it's very beginning, Tarantino doesn't just show you how things were in 1969, he places you there right along with it. I was there with all of them. Many of the sequences here include interludes of driving with an authentic live radio blasting (not unlike K-Billy's Super Sounds of the 70's) the soundtrack of our film. Killer psychedelic tunes and radio ads narrate the few times where our characters stay silent, which in any Tarantino film, is brief. The first hour and a half of the film may even puzzle viewers with how little happens between the characters. But that's the point. Tarantino places the audience through multiple POVs in order to illustrate this time in Hollywood. It was a technique I didn't expect, but I adored it all the same, and if anything, I'll always remember these sequences first when I think of the film. DiCaprio lights up the screen as the manically depressed Rick Dalton who goes between arrogantly strutting on set as if he's still a hot shot, to wrecking his trailer in a fit of insecurity and rage. Brad Pitt is effortlessly cool as Cliff Booth. Dude is the suavest partner-in-crime since Paul Newman. Robbie plays Tate, and with the responsibility of playing the prime victim of one of the most gruesome and horrifying murders in American history, she needed to bring honor in this special tribute to her. Not only did she bring honor, but she also brought beauty, grace, wistful optimism and love. If she had a a song, it would probably be ""Good Morning, Starshine"", though we all know she was a Paul Revere and the Raiders fan. Tate represents here all that was good of the late 60's. That far-out, free-spirited, love your neighbor, flower power that most Californians at that time adopted.. so long as you didn't take it to the extreme. If you did, you'd turn into one of those goddamn dirty hippies.That's the other thing that Tarantino explores in 1969. If you were worried about a film about the Manson family that glorifies them as super cool anti-heroes, you best sit down and let this film do the talking. Because Tarantino clearly doesn't just hate Charles Manson, he loathes him. The man who, in his mind, killed the 1960's and the Hollywood he loved. On that note, you might be asking yourself.. this film doesn't really reenact the events of that horrible night, does it? Well, I promise you, this is a spoiler free review, but lets just say the events of August 8th 1969 don't play out here as they did in history. What results is the biggest middle finger ever given to the Manson Family in an epic finale so mindbogglingly brutal and relentless, it will make your jaw drop.I left the theater having felt like I drank a strong cocktail of Boogie Nights and Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, ripped a bong and got awakened by a punch in the face. This is a movie, and a trip and an experience you won't soon forget. See this thing, right now. See it twice. See it three times. Invite in into your head and let it stay there and stew. Explore this tapestry of Americana, booze, sex, drugs, rock' n' roll and movies. You'll be exhausted, but you will be satisfied.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
A love letter to all that is Hollywood,"Just got out of a screening. This movie was perfection to me! Everything plays a part in the experience. This is some of the best acting I have seen in a long time. I was swept away with the look, music, and story. The best part of this movie is when you are spending time with these characters. Rick Dalton has quickly become on of my favorite characters of all time! Leo lights the screen on fire every time we are with him. He is the ultimate package in this by giving Rick so much depth. Pitt does an amazing job as well. Cliff Booth would be a guy I would want to hang out with. It's nice to see a movie about two guy friends that support one another in different facets of life. It is so much deeper than some sort of average buddy cop affair. Margo Robbie gets a shout out too. She truly embodies Sharon Tate and glows on screen. She is amazing. This is Tarantino at the height of his powers. He gets the best performance out of everyone in every part of this movie. There are a lot of very enjoyable smaller parts in this. It's also great to see him working with the second generation of actors and actresses he has worked with in the past. I was taken on a ride to every part of Hollywood in this. From the glitz and glamour to the dark and twisted. This movie has a really awesome third act that I wouldn't dream of spoiling. I consider it a cherry on top of an already perfect movie. The directing, writing, music, cinematography, acting were all on point. It's a slow burn but all in all this movie is about Hollywood and the different aspects of it. The rising and falling of it's movie stars, and the people that flock to it in hopes of a different life. Go in with an open mind and let the movie take you on it's ride and you won't be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
QT9 - a Hollywood fairy tale,"Greetings again from the darkness. Hippies, westerns, short skirts, pompadours, catchy pop songs ... all have (mostly) disappeared from our world. Back to save the day and the memories, and twist a little history, is Quentin Tarantino, the ultimate film geek. His latest reminds us of a bygone era of movie stars and old school filmmaking ... a once beloved industry which has been described as being on life support. There have been plenty of big screen love letters to Hollywood, but few if any, were filmed with so many personal touches and call-backs to the director's own films.In keeping with the request from Mr. Tarantino, this review will not include any spoilers or details that might negatively impact anyone's initial viewing of the film. It's a reasonable request since the film is so unique and literally packed with nostalgia, sight gags, and historical bits and pieces - some accurate, some not so much. There is a lot to take in and process, and the full impact of the initial viewing might result in awe, shock or disgust ... and maybe even all of the above. So this will be a pretty simple overview peppered with some insight that should enhance rather than spoil the experience.The film covers about 6 months in 1969, but in reality, it all takes place (at least what we see on screen) in 3 days. Leonardo DiCaprio (possibly his best ever performance) plays Rick Dalton, an actor who had a hit (fictional) TV western series in the 50's and 60's entitled ""Bounty Law"". Since the show ended, Rick has been unable to make the successful transition to movies. For comparison, think of Clint Eastwood, Steve McQueen and Burt Reynolds - all actors in TV westerns who found greater career success in movies. Brad Pitt (the epitome of cool) stars as Cliff Booth, Rick's stunt double, friend, driver, handyman, etc. While Rick is desperate to find the next stage of his career and fend off being forgotten, Cliff, a Vietnam vet, is accepting of his lot in life. Rick lives in a swanky Hollywood Hills home next door to hotshot director Roman Polanski and his starlet wife Sharon Tate; and Cliff lives in a trailer behind the Van Nuys Drive-In with his well-trained Rottweiler Brandy.There are multiple parallel stories to follow, and a key one involves the aforementioned Sharon Tate. Margot Robbie nails the role and bounces about town with the energy and sweet aura that we imagine she possessed. All 3 of the lead actors - DiCaprio, Pitt, Robbie - have knockout scenes that I'd love to be able to discuss, but I'm not sure how without giving away too much. What I can say is that each of these three talented actors prove that movie stars still exist.This is Tarantino's 9th film as a director (he counts the 2-part KILL BILL as one film), and he claims he will stop making films after number 10. There are multiple features we can count on in a QT film, and a ridiculously deep supporting cast is one. Going through each of the characters played by actors you will recognize would take a page and a half, so I'll cover only a few here. Margaret Qualley is a scene stealer as Pussycat, one of the Manson family girls. You likely remember her from the recent ""Fosse/Verdon"" or ""The Leftovers"", and here she fully embraces the hippie look and spirit. Emile Hirsch plays hairdresser Jay Sebring, one of those in the house with Ms. Tate on that fateful night, and Mike Moh plays Bruce Lee so convincingly that I was momentarily confused when he took off his sunglasses. Also making appearances are some Tarantino regulars: Kurt Russell (as a stunt coordinator and narrator), Michael Madsen (as an actor), and Bruce Dern as George Spahn (a late replacement after Burt Reynolds passed away). Others of note include Maya Hawke (Uma Thurman's daughter), Austin Butler (recently cast in the title role of Baz Luhrmann's Elvis biopic) as Tex Watson, Rumer Willis (Bruce's daughter) as actress Joanna Pettet, Damian Lewis as Steve McQueen, Al Pacino as agent Marvin Schwarzs, Dakota Fanning as Squeaky Fromme, and the late Luke Perry as actor Wayne Maunder (""Lancer""). 90 year old Clu Gulager (""The Virginian"", THE LAST PICTURE SHOW) makes an appearance, and Nicholas Hammond (Friedrich from THE SOUND OF MUSIC) tears into his role with gusto as director Sam Wanamaker. There is even a TV Guide cover featuring the late great character actor Andrew Duggan (""Lancer""). Some of these, and many more, are like cameos, but it's still fascinating to see the faces.1969 was 50 years ago, and Tarantino does a remarkable job of recreating the look of Sunset Boulevard, Hollywood Boulevard, Cielo Drive, and studio backlots. Much credit goes to Production Designer Barbara Ling and Set Decorator Nancy Haigh (frequent Coen Brothers collaborator and an Oscar winner for BUGSY). Arianne Phillips does a tremendous job with the costumes that look natural for the time period, and not like something right off the wardrobe racks. Three-time Oscar winning Cinematographer Robert Richardson (HUGO, THE AVIATOR, JFK) is back for his 6th Tarantino film, and he captures the look and feel and vibe of a time that is so personal to the director.It's been three and a half years since THE HATEFUL EIGHT, Tarantino's most recent film, and probably his worst received. This one is clearly personal as it captures the time and place that he fell in love with movies. The dichotomy of rising starlet and fading cowboy as neighbors is a brilliant way to make a point about times changing. This was a time of transition in the United States - a new culture was upon us, and whatever innocence remained, was surely snuffed out on a hot August night in 1969. As usual, his use of music serves a purpose. We are treated to Roy Head, The Royal Guardsmen, and Paul Revere and the Raiders, among others. QT also shows us plenty of bare feet (another trademark). What is unusual is that the film lacks the trademark mass dialogue. This one kind of meanders ... right up until it doesn't.Quentin Tarantino is a living, breathing film geek (that's a compliment) who has earned the right to make the movies he wants to make. This one took him a lifetime to live, 5 years to write, and it will take you 161 minutes to watch. It was warmly received at Cannes, but no one can expect to ""catch"" everything Mr. Tarantino has served up in one viewing. That said, one viewing will likely be one too many for quite a few folks (especially many under 40 who have no recollection of this Hollywood). Some will categorize this as an overindulgent nostalgia trip for movie nerds. And they are likely correct. But for those of us who complain that too many movies are remakes, re-treads and comic books, there is no denying Tarantino delivers a unique and creative viewing experience - and it's not meant for everyone.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

The classic fable tale, summs everything up, folks are gonna lie to themselves, and claim this is unique and sophiscated blah blah blah.

Undoubtful Masterpiece,"This movie is a complete masterpiece. Tarantino takes a step back from his usual blitzkrieg balls to the walls action and puts together a visual work of art. Leonardo DiCaprio effortlessly kills his role as an emotional and bipolar actor who is on the decline. Brad Pitt displays A-Lister acting as his no nonsense, go with the flow persona accompanies Leonardo DiCaprio as one of the finest movie duos ever. The chemistry between these 2 actors sets them far apart from any other movie duo and sets up the movie as a form of art.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
For a Tarantino flick disappointing to be sure,"I'm a huge T fan, absolutely love many of his movies, but not all and sadly this joins the later list. The best way to describe this movie is ""A day in the life of a Hollywood Actor in 1969"". That is, mostly just an AVERAGE day, which is largely where the problem lies for many of us who expected more here.Acting is great all around and saves it somewhat but like too often these days I really feel the script was weak. An example of this would be just how often we see Brad Pitt driving around by himself, where really nothing happens; it reeks of filler material but why even have it there in an already long film? Margo Robbie kind of got robbed here to some degree, her character just gets a very very minor role, didn't come off right at all.A day in the life of in 1969 is somewhat interesting to many but if that is going to be the core it really needed some more Ooommph; like the Bruce Lee scene, German meeting scene and sequences like the ending, which finally had his trademarks all over it. Even though the film does have a ""climax"", there was really almost no lead up to it, and almost no really story tension throughout, sadly it mostly just plods along.Really hoping for a return to form for his 10th and apparently possible last film. This film has some charm, which mostly comes through in the great acting, but overall this was disappointing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
QT resting on his laurels,"Im sorry, i do rate tarantino but OUATIH is missing too much for it to be enjoyable. Tarantino has never worked with linear plot but it never seemed to matter because the artistry, dialogue and individuality carried the films (pulp fiction etc) but this is no longer the case. Yes the cinematography and the mood is great but the rest is just boring. The multitude of irrelevant western scenes last for hours on end (why so many for so long) and so many other scenes do not stand up on their own (why does damian lewis arrive? And the little girl?).

A new age of Tarrantino,"I loved it. It was still clever and engaging and fascinating, the sound track was still out of this world, the script was still clever and humourous, but it seemed to be a different brand of Tarrantino. It wasnt as blood thirsty, the language, whilst your 5 year old cant watch it, wasnt as shocking as it has been in other films.
Brad Pitt is outstanding. Margot Robbie is stunning. Leonard Di Caprio is amazing.

Art can be fun!,"Haven't had this much fun since Pulp Fiction. Finally some terrific entertainment that isn't a comic book character or a lot of cgi. I'm rating it 10 because I can't think of a way it could have been better. There wasn't a minute in this film where I wasn't interested, engaged, and eager to keep watching. It's punchy, funny, LA glamourous, colourful yet noir-ish, the violence is gutsy and visual but it's Tarantino, so not just a run of the mill punch up shoot out--always a surprise and enough of a twist that you can't help laughing. The editing is an excellent juxtaposition of scenes and images. Lots of recognizable memories if you're a boomer--you'll be going ""oh yeah, that's right!"" But more than that, it has characters who are interesting, not just cutout action figures, but human beings, from the lead roles to the bit parts.

Once Upon A Time In Hollywood forced me to recall that the golden age of filmmaking was never this tedious.,"Not even Tarantino with his blood-soaked trademark violence can save this year from mediocrity. It's abundantly clear that his ninth film is a passion project, his love letter to 60s Los Angeles when it was deemed cool for the hippie lifestyle to integrate with mainstream America. It's substantially glossy, kaleidoscopic, heck some may even describe this three hour long ""epic"" as, well, epic. The only thing epic about this behemoth is Dalton's beastly flamethrower as he incinerates a group of Nazis. This is, without a doubt in my mind, Tarantino's weakest film to date and another sign of his progressive downfall in quality. An ageing television actor, his swooning stunt double and actress Sharon Tate navigate the alterations of the Hollywood film industry, with the Manson ""Family"" providing a suitably bleak backdrop.Technically, this comedy-drama is good, and I'm not just saying that to ease the scathing hatred that is inevitably flying my way from Tarantino fans. His directorial efforts were effortless. Managing to sustain multiple storylines with a wide array of cameos from his ensemble cast and allowing the lead actors to chew the scenery til it's just mulch. A tribute to the art of filmmaking whilst also providing insight in an actor's mind during vast changes within the industry that made him famous. Tarantino's foot fetish aside, his ability to swoop the camera from high octane tracking shots following a horse to sub-urban houses in Hollywood hills (mostly comprising of single takes) is unprecedented. Even with a simple conversational piece, much like when Dalton meets Fraser for the first time and talks about the novel he's reading and resembling, it's executed with such confidence that it immediately entrances you. Overextended and laborious? Absolutely. Yet witnessing Dalton come to terms with his acting talent, alongside the beautiful creature that is Olyphant playing James Stacy, is oddly engrossing.Of course, only possible due to DiCaprio's electric performance. Purposefully overacting, consistently shouting and harnessing the only developed arc out of all the characters Tarantino shoves into the film. His comedic timing, reminiscent of his venture in Scorsese's 'The Wolf of Wall Street', is impressive and allows a handful of laughs to sneak in, particularly when on the set of 'Lancer'. These characters all residing in a well-designed, precisely replicated and exuberant city that encapsulated the culture at the time. The production was immaculate, accompanied by a signature soundtrack that oozes sophistication and provides a mixtape for golden rock'n'roll.So, like I mentioned, technically this is a very proficient film. Which begs the question ""why was I underwhelmed?"". Well, that's because nothing happens. A near three-hour collage of Cliff Booth driving across Los Angeles, Sharon Tate watching her own film and the Manson ""Family"" walking bare feet on lukewarm sand. It's so self-indulgent with no actual substance that it borders on being pretentious. The multiple storylines rarely mesh. Booth is the exact same character from start to finish and is only present to beat the smack down out of Bruce Lee. Tate has no purpose to the over arcing story whatsoever and diminishes the talent of Robbie who has considerably limited screen time. The entire Manson backdrop is utterly futile in terms of placement, that it seems incredibly forced during the last act (although ridiculously fantastic to watch) just so Tarantino can address the cult's motives. The length that various scenes last for was enough to send anyone to sleep, mostly due to the restrained writing from Tarantino that lacks the punch from his previous efforts. An unaccomplished conclusion that left me questioning the entire purpose of the film. Aside from Dalton being introduced to his neighbours, the start of the story is the exact same as the ending. No one has any development! When Tarantino alludes to something happening, like Booth investigating Spahn Ranch, he deviates and sets the pace back to pedestrian mode. Simply a mish-mash of cameos so that everyone working in Hollywood today can claim they were part of a Tarantino feature.For a film that is designed to be a homage to the golden age of Hollywood, there is a distinct lack of gold to be found in this bejewelled ensemble presentation. Whilst technically proficient and wonderfully acted, the absence of substance and genuine character development makes a three-hour affair feel more like a five hour ordeal. And it pains me to say that, as I wanted Tarantino to be the saving grace of this lacklustre year.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

The most Tarantino a movie can be,"This film might subvert people's expectations by not really being about the murder on Sharon Tate. It's about a struggling actor and his stunt double and their lives in Hollywood of 1969. The audience follows actor Rick Dalton through his career while presenting his fear of being more and more forgotten. All in all not much plot is happening in a movie that is as long as Django Unchained. And dammed, is it amazing.
The acting, cinematography, dialogue and characters are all as beautiful and outstanding as Tarantino is famous for. I didn't see the story going anywhere and I didn't need to. Every single scene is intriguing and entertaining. I enjoyed it so much that I was actually sad when it was over. A three hour movie felt too short because I wanted more and more.

Just imagine watching nearly a 3hr movie with no plot.. nothing happens, the end scene was super predictable and the main reason for this film was to show off how good the acting and set designs could be.

A film for people who love the 60s and Hollywood nostalgia,"There really is no other film much like Once upon a time in Hollywood. It's cinematography and music score are enough to make anyone with enough knowledge of the late 60s and the golden age of Hollywood, leap with joy. I can remember seeing this in theaters on the day it came out and since it was new no one really new what to expect going into the movie. No one even really knew what the movie was about. And that's a good thing. Movies where you can guess what happens at the end are not good movies, and this is not one of those movies. I don't know what I was expecting when I saw this, but I pleasantly surprised to find this my Quentin Tarantino movie. I'll always love django unchained, but that movie can't be compared to this one at all. Once upon a time isn't even a film, really. it's Quentin creating his own fairytale universe with his special Tarantino touch of unnecessary but oddly entertaining dialogue, sudden beautiful and bloody violence that startles you to your core, and those detailed and distinct characters that feel real enough to walk right off the silver screen. In short this is the best Quentin Tarantino film I've ever seen, But I know for sure some of you will not like this film no matter how much you like Quentins work. This movie is not for everyone. If you've never seen a old movie (and by old I mean older then the 1980s and 1970s) then this movie will probably not interest you. If your not a fan of long dialogues and scenes of characters narrating over themselves, again this is not the movie for you. If you don't know who Charlie mason Is or have never heard of the mason family murders. Then look those up before watching this movie I recommend doing that or the ending will seem pointless. But if your a fan of any of the stuff I mentioned above or, nostalgia and golden age Hollywood stuff, this may end up being one of your favorite movies. And Leonardo DiCaprio, and brad Pitt are in this, that equals a good time for everyone watching. I also believe Leo would have won best actor for this movie, if Joaquin Phoenix's joker wasn't released the same year as this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

"Slickly made in many ways, but the content is unfocused, messy, and too reliant on the delivery in the moment than the bigger picture","I approached this film not knowing too much about it, although I was a little aware of the Manson murders, Sharon Tate, and the fact that this film was loosely set around those events, but very much a fictional version of them (or a total fairy tale as is suggested by the title). Watching the film needed me to invest in that approach from the very start, because it is a nostalgic imagining of a better time without much of a connection to reality. This is made reasonably clear throughout by the insertion of the characters into real shows and films of the era, and of course by significant elements of the ending, which changes history somewhat.What is less clear is 'why' the film is doing this. It produces a reasonably enjoyable film with plenty to enjoy in the moment, in the performances, and in the overall delivery, but in terms of narrative flow it feels so fragmented and unfocused that it is hard to stick with it for such a long running time. Almost all of the scenes are engaging in some way, but as a whole they do not come together; even the extreme revision of history seems like it lacks a specific point or message for the casual viewer. It was a distancing effect on me because I enjoyed all these moments but yet was happy in them without caring really for what came next.The performances are strong. Pitt is good (although I was surprised by his Oscar) but I found DiCaprio to be the stronger performance as he had more character to get his teeth into. Robbie is a cheery presence, but only that - she isn't really a character so much as a frame of reference that we have to like; as such she works, but it doesn't sit well in the film because there is a lot of oddity when it comes to the handling of characters. The women are consistently fawned over, with a particularly weird focus on feet almost every chance it gets. Likewise the female characters bring less to the film, and are much more 'devices' than even some male characters with very little screen time.In the end, it is still a solid movie with plenty to like about it, but this is almost in spite of itself. It has unforced problems, seems rambling and messy, and relies a lot on the sheer force of its talent (cast and crew) to make the film work as well as it does - but this isn't well enough for something this long that doesn't have a strong enough narrative through-line.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

"Whenever your passion for cinema gets low, watch a Tarantino's movie and you're back on track.","(Once Upon A Time In Hollywood - The organized mess)
This is the Tarantioniest movie I've seen since Kill Bill, although Django Unchained and Inglorious B*stards are considered two of the greats or
modern classics as I'd like to call, they're not Tarantinoed as this one.
Tarantino is a genius, and most of the cinephiles can't argue with that. Putting that in mind while watching OUATIH drives you to always find a single tiny
specific detail that is hidden here or there that supports maybe the movie cause, the cinematic era or even Tarantino's world and it's always perfectly
organized with the others flow despite scattering them all around the scenes.(The symbolism - '60s '70s)
Rick Dalton is an actor at the edge of his career. He is becoming neglected in Hollywood and his tomato is now rotten.
Rick represents an entire era of TV actors during the '50s and the '60s, they had the talent they could do it but how they handled it made them
decay year after year. You'll notice the conversation between Rick and the young girl in the location how he sees it and how she sees it, a huge difference
in point of views.
Sharon Tate represents the new era of acting, how it's gonna be in the '70s. You can see that both of them are neighbors but they haven't even say
hello to each other once, this is the barrier, the barrier between the '60s and '70s in the Hollywood cinema, very small, massive difference.
The incident that is supposedly was the full stop to the '60s was Sharon Tate death by the Manson family. But, what if there was a little modification in
history, what if the Manson family were killed before their act by this expired actor, what if the '60s actor then met with the '70s future providing unseen
combination, maybe the history of cinema would differ, it could've been better, could've been worse.
Fairy tale, isn't it? but don't worry, it won't happen, it is just Once Upon A Time In Hollywood.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

The Most Mature and Intelligent Tarantino Film To Date,"I just got in from watching Once Upon a Time In Hollywood. I've been a Quentin Tarantino fan since, well, Reservoir Dogs. Amid his trademark over-the-top violence and gore, I have always felt he treats the art with a respect that's often lost in controversy. His execution of heartfelt homage is so authentic that it becomes his biggest criticism, and to the less astute, is often dismissed as blatant theft.Once Upon a Time In Hollywood is the homage of all homages. Critics are calling this Tarantino's ""love letter to Hollywood"", but in reality it's much, much more. This letter addresses a Hollywood that's no longer recognizable, and that melancholy is woven into the fabric of this film. While there is the requisite violence, witty banter, and unpredictable outcomes, this is probably the most mature and intelligent Quentin Tarantino film yet. It also deviates from the Tarantino template by remaining somewhat linear. With a runtime of just over two hours and forty minutes, the pacing is artfully throttled, allowing the audience to take in the authentic and painstakingly detailed scenery. The period music drives the narrative but never becomes a music video. The performances are flawless. Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt will deservedly receive accolades for their performances as the main characters, but honestly there is not a single weak performance among the ensemble. And lastly, the subject matter: I was admittedly apprehensive about how the events of August 8, 1969 would be handled. While no one would be surprised to see these heinous acts glorified or even caricatured, Tarantino continues to be unpredictable. At the risk of spoiling the plotline, I'll just say this is handled tastefully and even respectfully, yet true to the classic Tarantino flair.Once Upon a Time in Hollywood demonstrates a more mellowed Quentin Tarantino touch but it's far from a departure. I suspect audiences that normally can't stomach the assaulting violence and shock of the Tarantino brand may very well enjoy this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

Especially if you know a bit of history. It's intense and amazing and I'll just leave it at that.That said, it is a little male-biased by modern standards, but it's capturing the mentality of a different time period. DiCaprio and Pitt play two wildly different characters that you just want to keep watching to see they do next. They will quite possibly win Oscars for their performances -- and Tarantino will no doubt be up for best director, best original screenplay and best film.If you enjoy Tarantino's moviemaking style - the dialog, the visuals, the period details and, yes ... the violence ... this is a must see.

Quentin Tarantino is the truth,"Films needed saving this year and oh boy Tarantino saved the s*** out of it. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood may not be Tarantino's best work, but it damn sure comes close to taking that spot. The directing is phenomenal, Quentin Tarantino exquisitely shows once again why he is one of this generation's auteurs. The performances from everyone, especially Leo and Brad, are extraordinary and the writing is superb, as were given dialogue that only Tarantino could pull off. If any other director/writer tried the conversations he works in this film; then half the audience would probably have fallen asleep. This also may be Tarantino's funniest film yet, and because of that, it made for one of my favorite theatre experiences of the year. I don't think I've laughed that hard at a movie as I did with Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. However, with all that said what may be the most impressive thing about this film is the cinematography and set pieces. Tarantino does a fantastic job transporting the audience into this world, and I never felt for a moment that this wasn't Hollywood during the '60s.Nevertheless, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is not perfect, it's pretty damn close to it, but I do have an issue with the film, and that's pacing. Throughout the film, multiple scenes could be removed from the final cut and wouldn't affect the outcome of the movie at all. While other (necessary) parts of the film are way longer, then they have any right to be. Unnecessary scenes, info, and dialogue are my biggest gripe with Tarantino as a writer. You could, however, look on the other side and say that those ""unnecessary"" scenes are quite entertaining, and they usually are, and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is no exception. Although it has those elongated dialogues and unnecessary scenes, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is still pretty entertaining at being gratuitous so it somewhat (not entirely) makes up for it.In a year full of unoriginal and disappointing films, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood truly stands out from the pack. Tarantino's ninth film is not without its faults, but what film isn't? Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, elegantly displays why Quentin Tarantino is one of the greatest filmmakers ever and is easily the best film of 2019.

They even splice Di Caprio into the Great Escape as a 'what if?' moment...but all for what? Just Hollywood slapping itself on the back again about being Hollywood.There were genuine tense moments like when Pitt's character visits the Manson family allotment that turn into a damp squib. Again why was that scene so long? Why did they spend so much time on Di Caprio playing the baddy in the western but no time at all on his character's move to Italy (apart from the fact Tarantino wanted to imagine what 1960s spaghetti western posters would've looked like with DiC in them!). And what was the point of Al Pacino? Or Sharon Tate's character for that matter once you see the ending....?This was a missed opportunity that could've been a great piece on an actor's dwindling career that just turned into a boring series of sort of linked scenes...albeit quite well acted ones.

To me Tarantino is at his best when he makes movies that are driven by the interesting characters in them rather than blood gore and one big climactic event that everything leads up to (nothing wrong with some blood though) For instance, everyone loves Pulp fiction and rightfully so that movie is one of the greatest movies of all time. This is a movie that is exciting fast-paced and sometimes extremely over the top. While entertaining, this style of moviemaking to me is not where Tarantino excels to his greatest extent and I feel like this isn't the type of movie Tarantino has liked to make for a long time as evidenced by how much he has had to cut out of the hateful 8 and Jackie Brown. Jackie Brown is another movie that suffers from the same problem in many people's eyes that once upon a time in Hollywood does. To some people both these stories may seem drawn-out overindulgent and Meandering. However I find these movies too much more interesting due to their much more realistic pacing and more interest in their characters as people rather than plot devices. As shown in other movies like The hateful eight and Jackie Brown flushing out the real sustenance of a character and putting that on screen is where Tarantino really tends to shine and is criminally underappreciated by many people. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is another one of those movies I feel Tarantino truly shines in the way he wants to. Here he has created a movie that is driven by and it is about the interesting people that lived 1960s Hollywood and their everyday experiences that made their lives so interesting rather than simply being about the huge climactic events that many people thought this movie would solely be about. Tarantino's choice to recreate the 1960s thoroughly in this film was also a huge reason why this movie truly shines in what it sets out to do. You can literally feel the town of Los Angeles from 50 years ago spring off the screen and come to life as you watch this movie. Don't go into this movie expecting an overzealous gorefest a True Crime documentary or an over-the-top drama. Go into this film expecting to be immersed in the world that Rick Cliff and Sharon live in and be prepared to thoroughly enjoy those people, their very interesting lives, the town that they lived in, the music and radio that they listen to, and the stories they have to tell. If you do this I can tell you right now you will fall in love with this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Take my Breath Away,Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt ACED this film! Best Dynamic Duo ever! Giving lots of Praise to the Cast and Quentin Tarantino for the film! This is a must see film! Highly recommend it! 10/10! Definitely gonna get this film when it comes to Blu-Ray!,10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
I can see why some might not like it but I was enthralled,"To me, this film is a culmination of all of Tarantino's past films blended together. This is a film about films, a film about why we make films. It's a long movie with constant movie references and tributes and if you don't pick up on any of these things while watching you probably won't enjoy the first 2 hours. This is a dialogue driven, hangout movie paying tribute to Tarantino's film ingredient roots.
However, if you're a film fanatic, a history fanatic or a film history fanatic this movie is what you've been waiting for. This film has so much going for it and it is one of the most enjoyable experiences I've had at the theater in a long time. Both Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt give two of the best performances in their long careers.
Don't go into this movie ready for action at every corner. You'll get your action. Until then relax and get transported back to 1969.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Masterpiece that not everyone will like and/or understand,"Beautiful cinematography,great acting, Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio look amazing on the screen.

"Some nice visual work, Pitt is great but movie drags on too much","Quentin Tarantino is one of my favorite directors but this movie lacks focus and was not well edited.First, I want to clear up one thing that some reviewers are getting wrong: this movie is not about the golden age of Hollywood. Tarantino was capturing Hollywood in the aftermath of the golden age which ended more than a decade earlier with the rise of television. He never claimed this period was the Golden Age of Hollywood.A 2 hour and 40 minute movie can work well if there is enough substance and pace but this movie lacks both unfortunately.Brad Pitt is great. It is one of his three best performances and deserves an Oscar. He and Tarantino clearly have good chemistry. Tarantino wrote True Romance, which was one of Pitt's early parts. There is one scene that parallels his role in that film.Leonardo is good but the movie spends too much time showing him doing takes in cowboy movies. Also, he appears to be overacting a lot of the time (stuttering) which I guess is how Tarantino wanted him to be because perhaps Tarantino has his own stuttering issues and wanted to reflect that in the character but it felt awkward.I felt that the backdrop of this story (the Manson family) was not the best choice for a film though Tarantino does a better job with it than I expected.There are some good cameos but they are too short. Michael Madsen, Al Pacino and Kurt Russell are all guys you would like to spend more than just a few minutes with. Bruce Dern (82 at time of filming) is also fine in a small but important role.There are a ton of great cinematography scenes in here that bump up my rating. One in particular involves Margot Robbie and the Roman Polanski character driving fast through Hollywood in a very impressive piece of camerawork.The cinematographer is Robert Richardson (Platoon, Kill Bill, Hateful Eight, JFK, Natural Born Killers, Hugo).One of the best scenes is actually a car chase from the 1967 Italian movie Death on the Run (directed by one of Tarantinos favorites Sergio Corbucci) which is shown on the screen.The time and effort spent recreating 60s Hollywood with the neon signs, the old cars, the movie posters and other set design pieces can not be understated. Credit Tarantino here for his vision as well as masterful set decoration by Nancy Haigh (Forrest Gump, Field of Dreams, Bugsy, Road to Perdition, Truman Show, No Country for Old Men).Tarantino does a superb job in picking his music. Lots of great offbeat and obscure 60s songs lift the film. There is a cool reference to the actor Edmond (Eddie) O'Brien.Overall, this is enjoyable if you can put up with the slow parts and a gory ending that is just a tad over the top as Tarantino likes to be. I think he did a great job with Margot Robbie though I think he actually could have shaved off about five minutes of her walking around Hollywood. Would Sharon Tate really go to the movies alone and do we need to see her bare feet on the seat?The final three minutes are cinematic greatness. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood needed a few more great moments.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

More Misdirection Than Penn and Teller,"Tarantino has stated that ""Once"" is not Sharon Tate's movie. It's Rick Dalton's story. Yes, we get to ride the emotional rollercoaster of a man losing his place in his society, then discovering ""too little, too late"" that he may have had the acting chops all along that could have saved him from his plight. While that tempest rages we get to glide along with Cliff Booth, who possesses the self assurance of a man adept at martial arts with the ability to have anyone ""do anything you want to him. Throw him off a building, alright? Light him on fire. Hit him with a Lincoln, right? Get creative. Do whatever you want ..."" Cliff's journey stands in sharp counterpoint to the star he shadows.But what of Sharon Tate? Her little snippets (not even vignettes) pepper the movie, and leads to ..... WHAT?In the movie, had she not been featured the way she was, she would have (as in real life) been viewed as just another blonde bimbo starlet snatched up as so much candy on a successful director's arm. The movie provides us an opportunity to get to know Sharon (unlike real life), as a pretty young woman who has maintained her humanity, her friendliness, her affection for her friends and her public, and her warm affinity for all she meets. Her interaction with the ticket taker and the manager of the theater, her quiet enjoyment of the audience enjoying her point to a woman of depth of character, someone worth knowing. Someone worth grieving over.Reviews have been written about the over the top violence ending this film. Yet none of the violence compares to that actually perpetrated against Sharon and her friends in real life. To know this young woman was repeatedly knifed while her unborn child was carved from her body, to imagine the Manson family reveling in their blood lust, scrawling the word ""PIG"" on the walls in the young mother's blood, to know she begged for mercy having done nothing at all to provoke the mayhem performed on her makes the movie violence seen here a footnote to the atrocity that actually occurred.Understanding this, we're left with a piquancy, a longing sadness, barely buoyed by the ending offered by the film. For those criticizing the film for being too slow, for those debasing this effort as not providing enough tension, for the rabid shoot-em-up fans I suggest they view this as a trick performed by the expert magicians, Penn and Teller. It looks like a revenge fantasy: nope, it's a character study. HA! Fooled you all again! It's a rom-com! And like any Tarantino movie, twisting all our expectations, the ending to his rom-com leaves you with an aching heart.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

A ninth opus distinctly different,"Even if the context and the script are fundamentally different,Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood (2019)is inherently alikeHail, Caesar! (2016)directed by the Coen brothers and lovingly dedicated to the cinematographic world of the 50's and more precisely to the Hollywood gossips. Thus, with his ninth opus,Quentin Tarantinoplunges us with delightful and nostalgia into the Hollywood atmosphere of 1969 with two main characters: Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a has-been actor and Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) is his personal stuntman. And during the first two hours, we bump with pleasure into major figures of the seventh art such asSteve McQueen(I'm an indefectible fan!),Roman PolanskiorBruce Lee.Quentin Tarantinowas 6 years old in 1969. This film is an avalanche of cult references of his childhood with implicit or explicit allusions toWanted: Dead or Alive (1958),The Green Hornet (1966),The Great Escape (1963),Dixie Dynamite (1976), the Western Spaghetti, a well-known subgenre of Western films that emerged in the mid-60s, ... And the barbaric murder ofSharon Tateis unfortunately a nightmarish Proust's madeleine.For sure, the atmosphere of 1969 is perfectly transcribed with a strong focus on the two fictive fellows, Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth. Thus,Brad Pittinterprets a guy without particular ambition, fulfilled, living from day to day without worrying about tomorrow and endowed with an exceptionally mesmerizing aura; in the audience, women were obviously under his spell.Leonardo DiCaprioimpersonates a more complex individual who is no more than the shadow of himself, inexorably sliding towards the abysses of oblivion. They are both awesome! AndMargot Robbie? Well, well, well, she sublimely shines. I truly behaved like theTex Avery's howling wolf in each of her scenes!If you are a film buff, you will probably enjoyOnce Upon a Time... in Hollywood (2019). If you are a fan ofQuentin Tarantinoas I am, you may be surprised or even frustrated by the contemplative narration and the deliberately slow pace. Actually, with a recipe including 2 major ingredients such as 1)Sharon Tatein August 1969 and 2)Quentin Tarantino, we may say that the cooking is over a sloooooow heat until the long-awaited final denouement, and the prepared dish is undoubtedly lacking of bloody red chili.PS: There are rumors thatQuentin Tarantinowill bow out after his tenth opus.

For the cinematic intellectual,"This movie is not for the average weekend movie buff like me. It requires a unique set of appreciative skills for the artistic value imbibed within this film.

For students of the filmmaking arts though, it is something of a study in itself.

A lot of people complain that there was no plot, but that's simply not true. It's about two neighbors, both actors, one who's career is just starting, and the other who's career hit a slump.

His Most Beautifully Told Story With The Most Tarantino Trademarks,"I have to say right off the bat, I really enjoyed this movie. It was not in your face like Pulp Fiction; it was not streamlined to a story like ReservoirDogs and Jackie Brown; it was not heavy with action like Kill Bill 1/2. However, it is a period piece like his last three movies, The Hateuful Eight, Django Unchained, and Inglorious Basterds.It is a beautifully told story which allows the exploration of alternate timelines (he has done the before in Inglorious Bastards). It does tend to form as a story slower than most of his writings, but it is a story which needs to be told at this pace.Many classic movies in history follow the same pace. I think this is why he used this type of storytelling. He is comparing classic movies of culture; the timeless storytelling moviegoers were used to many years ago.What I liked the most about this movie is QT purposely integrated his classic fashionable trademarks within to ensure everyone knows this is a powerful story told only the way he knows how. He used his trademark of showing feet more in this movie than any other. In all of his movies those feet are always attached to incredibly beautiful women (one exception is Carradine in KB II). I think he may be doing this to show his feelings about Hollywood and this era.Also, just to let you know, when you see this, make sure to stay through the credits.

Not what I was Expecting,"Quentin Tarantino's 9th film features some of the biggest superstars in the business. Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt really are the best duo since Paul Newman and Robert Redford. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is worth watching just for the epic star power alone along with Tarantino's signature killer soundtrack. Tarantino is known to subvert norms and create controversy. He does so here, but to a lesser satisfying degree.When news first hit about Tarantino doing an old Hollywood piece centering around the Manson murders of 1969, one could assume he'd be doing another wild over-the-top bloodbath with snappy dialogue, entertaining storytelling and iconic characters. While the Mansons and Sharon Tate are present in the film, their roles are disappointingly underrepresented. Sharon Tate (played gleefully by Margot Robbie) does not do much throughout the movie but watch her own films. The Manson ranch is shown but Charlie Manson is only present for five seconds. These people vital to the real life story don't really have much purpose here. The story focuses more on Leonardo DiCaprio's character Rick Dalton, a former TV star trying to stay relevant in the Hollywood spotlight.While the story at hand with Rick Dalton has its moments (Bruce Lee scene and forgetting lines), it's too long and too dragged out. Tarantino goes for setting an authentic feel, and establishing character development over plot. Much of the film feels like it's going nowhere, so it's boring sometimes. The film is more of a love letter to old Hollywood. A lot of work was put into taking us back in time to 1969, impressively done without CGI. It's impressive technically but it lacks an exciting narrative - something Tarantino normally delivers on. The first two hours or so shows everyday life for these characters, but doesn't become a 'movie' until the end. The last 15 minutes is classic Tarantino. Without spoiling it, it utilizes everything we have come to know and love about Tarantino. He subverts your expectations, but to a lesser satisfying degree.A film where Tarantino brought every act of his storytelling prowess together was The Hateful Eight. The Hateful Eight set up a mystery while making the audience guess what was going to happen next. Then it climaxed into a violent, hysterical, quotable, and utterly badass bloodbath. But what Once Upon a Time in Hollywood was lacking was the build-up to the climax. The ending was just slapped on so you know you're watching Tarantino. The Hateful Eight worked better as a story which is why the ending was much more satisfying than this film.Once Upon a Time in Hollywood delivers some rare cinematic treats, courtesy of Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt. However, one can't help but feel a little disappointed with Tarantino given the stellar cast and the legendary Manson backstory he had to work with.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

Once upon blah blah,"Really? This is supposed to be a Quentin Tarantino picture? While I was watching it in a pretty full theatre, two couples walked out way before the famous ending. I don't know what went wrong here...there's not much going on, except for observing this endless struggle one of the main characters is going through, which after a while becomes tedious and unbearable to watch. When that ending finally starts to unfold, you can't help but wonder what could've been if the entire movie had been that good and intriguing. In spite of previously mentioned, the acting is superb. There is one suspenseful scene before the ending, that almost felt like watching a horror film all of a sudden, which I liked a lot. I understand that a lot of stuff is a nod or a homage to that golden age of Hollywood, however, I don't like how it is represented, especially a certain scene where real Bruce Lee is shown in an unflattering light, undeservingly so, which is perhaps done on purpose or not. Maybe it was supposed to have been ironic, but somehow that irony got lost on me. This film needs shorter run-time.

I hope Tarantino donates his brain to science,"SYNOPSIS:
A re-imagining of the Manson murders while paralleling a story focused on Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio), an outdated actor who is trying to find his way back to being on top of Hollywood cinema.REVIEW:
A long movie. A long movie for sure with some fat that could be trimmed. This was a very divisive film and I can definitely see why. I did enjoy the film for the most part, there was just a whole lot of ""wtf am I watching?""POSITIVES:
DiCaprio is so good in this. Truly a great year for film and the Best Actor category is so strong it's not even funny. Some actors who weren't nominated had winning performances in other years. Brad Pitt is another one. Fantastic job. He deserves to win and I'm sure he will. To everyone saying ""it's just Brad Pitt being Brad Pitt"", and no one can play that cool ass stunt double better. He's never won for Best Actor playing the cool guy so let's give him this one cause damn was he good. He's the first non-superhero that I watched and was like, ""wish I was that guy."" The guy was poor living in a trailer and the shadow of Dalton and I wanted so bad to be him. There were many memorable scenes like all of the scenes where Rick Dalton was shooting a film or show and the scene with Bruce Lee (Mike Moh) was simple and purely awesome. The last 30 mins of this film were spectacular and you won't convince me otherwise.JULIA BUTTERS:
Yea... had to make her own section this. BEST. ACTING. EVER. *clears throat* okay, moving on.NEGATIVES:
Too long. Enough said on that. Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) almost felt not necessary. Someone sparked the idea that possibly we were following her for an excess amount of time to try to diverge the audience into believing we were going to see the real outcome of the horrendous Manson crimes, but to that I say Tarantino is known to flip the true story into what we all secretly cynically desire would've actually happened. So, yes, have Sharon Tate in there, but let's not focus too much on that. I understand this was a love letter to Hollywood, for me I didn't connect much with it so that fell flat. Unfortunately, a lot of the dialogue didn't carry me throughout the film like most of Tarantino's films have in the past.
CONCLUSION:
This film had a lot of very funny and memorable scenes, however, the runtime really hurt this film and I felt that a lot of the dialogue in this film couldn't help carry me through. Absolutely, stellar acting all around and great directing. Great film at time and sorely lacking at other times. 6.7/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

I kinda admire it because the man has an incredible catalogue of films - so if this is his opus then good for him. I'm just not really that big a fan of feet or clued up on my hollywood lore so it simply didn't bite. 45mins shorter and I might've given it more.

A little disjointed,"In order for the film's final 15 bloody minutes to feel justified, read some information on the Manson family for some context. I am a Tarantino fan, I know his style and what he does with violence, and I understand dealing with real life events garners more care and respect, but the ending of this movie felt over the top and out of place. Up to that point, we haven't received any solid justification for the extreme violence that takes place.Part of the reason the ending felt out of place was that the first 3/4 of the movie also have a totally different pace and tone. Leonardo DiCaprio steals the show - I was fully entertained with his storyline and the clever throw backs to old Hollywood. The scene with California Dreamin' was extremely effective and nostalgic. There were a few pacing issues and overly long scenes that went no where. Overall a solid 7 despite a few problems.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"Tarantino film on Hollywood, dreamlike, fiery... and long","I usually see a film knowing as little as possible because I find it helps maximize the film's impact. Quentin Tarantino's latest epic recreation (and desecration) of history proves to be the exception. It pays to read up on this film's essential story especially if you had not been born yet when it all takes place.Which is not to say the film isn't arresting and captivating even if you don't know all the players. But it will seem interminable, maybe even aimless at times if you don't know where Tarantino is going. Some of it will be obvious to younger viewers, the rest of it no so much. But I highly recommend knowing the lay of the land before going to see this. Otherwise, you're more likely to feel the running time of this film.In terms of performances, Leonardo DiCaprio is quite good as a fading Hollywood actor who is grasping at straws to revive his career, but here he is out-acted by a considerable margin by Brad Pitt who turns in a charismatic performance as the actor's stunt double and driver. Margot Robbie is an appealing presence as the young, up-and-coming actress Sharon Tate. Al Pacino and Kurt Russell are both a joy to watch in small roles that add spice and backstory to the proceedings.As a director, Tarantino has a recurring issue with his films rarely getting sufficient cutting room time, and here it's no exception. Although I would have preferred a tighter film, the gripping closing act erases most of the flaws and ends on a bittersweet note, leaving us with a truly surreal film experience, that is a feather in the cap of everyone involved. All it could have used was a real editor. Recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

Boring or Disrespectful,"My first reaction was, ""Who is the audience for this?"" Manson, Helter Skelter, the Hollywood of Sharon Tate are almost in the forgotten or unknown history of anyone under 40. Will the audience pick up the subtle establishment of these historical characters? Unless they go to the theatre prepped with the significance of the dates, will they know the context of the plot. If they think this is a movie about the fading trajectory of Hollywood careers, they will find the plot very slow and plodding. If they are knowledgable enough to know the Sharon Tate's story, they may feel the weight of the inevitable hanging over the whole piece, but, even with this stellar cast and a pervading anticipation of doom, this movie spends a lot of time on nothing. Personally, I think the cheat at the end is not a good enough payoff for the 161 minutes. The acting is good enough for a 6 (fair) out of 10, but Tarantino come close to boring us to death or, worse yet, disrespecting the victims of a shocking evil. {Criminal Dramedy?}",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

Much ado about nothing.,"DiCaprio and Pitt collaborate with Tarantino once again for the directors ninth (and supposedly penultimate) feature film as writer/director. Set in 1969 Hollywood, the film follows fading actor Rick Dalton (DiCaprio) and his loyal stunt double Cliff Booth (Pitt) as they navigate their way through the absurdities of Hollywood life. Inbetween their exploits we follow Sharon Tate (Robbie), who gleefully indulges in all the fun and glamour that Tinseltown has to offer. I'm a big Tarantino fan, so naturally my expectations for Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood were high. What a shame it is then to report his ninth feature is an uneven, average affair that doesn't live up to the brilliance of his previous efforts.Both DiCaprio and Pitt make for a great pairing, and they both carry the film even throughout its most sluggish moments. Margot Robbie is sadly wasted in the film as Tarantino gives her practically nothing of worth to work with, resulting in what feels more like an over glorified cameo as opposed to a legitimate role worth playing. Narratively speaking, the film is uneven and at times tedious to sit through. Tarantino is known for his engaging storylines, intriguing characters and sharp dialogue, but none of that is to be found here. Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood doesn't really have a cohesive storyline, emphasized largely by the elimination of chapter breakdowns, a storytelling technique Tarantino is widely known for. At its core, it's a celebration of Hollywood moviemaking during the sixties and an exploration into the relationships between actors and their stunt doubles. While there are a handful of noteworthy scenes to be found here, they aren't enough to save the film from being a pretty average affair. Technically speaking the film is very well made and contains great shot composition along with a solid soundtrack. Unfortunately, there just aren't many ideas on display worthy of hanging a feature film on, making for a disappointing outing from one of the modern masters of cinema. If this is indeed Tarantino's penultimate effort, hopefully his swansong will return to the quality of his previous works.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

"Outstanding Picture, slow build","A visually captivating movie by Tarantino. Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio played their characters to perfection and will most likely get oscars for their efforts. Trailers paint this movie to make it seem Margot Robbie's Sharon Tate is a main character, which is not the case, so don't go in thinking it's mainly about Manson, because you'll be disappointed. The last 20 minutes or so is classic Tarantino. Brad Pitt is hilarious and it's just fun to see him in this role. A very well done drama, just remember one thing, this movie is mainly a DRAMA. Not a normal Tarantino action movie, he focuses more on bringing back the narrative of what a movie is supposed to be, instead of some of the lousy pictures we get today. 10/10 for #9. Can't wait for #10, his official bow. It's going to be a classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

An end of an era movie about the end of an era?,"Big budget blockbusters with adult themes and limited special effects are a dying breed in Hollywood. Quentin Tarantino is one of the few auteurs that makes them anymore. And if Once Upon a Time in...Hollywood is one of the last of a dying breed, it's an awfully good picture to go out on.As Tarantino regales about another dying breed 50 years ago, he packs his script with enough references and self-references for 10 movies. He concocts a detailed back-story for his lead with a filmography and film clips galore. There are also several movies within the movie. You'd probably have to watch it 3 or 4 times and take a graduate-level course on Hollywood in the 60s to catch all the Easter eggs- one that I haven't seen mentioned-Cliff's wife has a sister, Natalie, and the mystery of the wife's demise mirrors that of Natalie Wood. That's just one of like 1000.His depiction of Los Angeles in 1969 is an astounding feat. How are they driving down an LA freeway in broad daylight with what looks like actual traffic with nothing but 1960s cars? It doesn't look like CGI because it isn't! They shut down the highway! They built the storefronts, and recreated the movie posters, the interiors, and even the Spahn Ranch with obsessive attention to detail. It absolutely looks like 1969. It's utterly immersive.They didn't move the camera like this in 1969, though--long tracking shots following cars and horses and swooping crane shots over long-lost LA landmarks that take your breath away. I was giddy watching it. It'd be a great movie even without dialogue. But the script will have a good shot at an Oscar. The performances and casting are basically flawless. I wouldn't be surprised if DiCaprio snags another statue--and he might not be the only one.I really don't understand people that don't care for this picture. Is it a generational thing? The references are eluding the younger audience? They know little or nothing about schlocky 60s movies or TV or the Manson family? It's moves too slow for them? It's too long? (On a price per entertaining minute basis this might be the best deal ever!) Do they not appreciate real old-fashioned movie making that doesn't use CGI as a crutch? Because this film will be studied in film classes in 50 years, or 100 years. As a technical achievement, it's that good.The story is plenty good too, although if you are over a certain age like the director and myself, it will have more resonance. And it contains ample QT-style revenge for the schmoes who came for the ultra-violence.I guess I don't get what's not to like. It is a sublime movie going experience. I wonder how much longer they're going to make 'em like this. Outside of Tarantino and the Coens, maybe they've already stopped.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Mixed Feelings,"Some things about this movie I loved a lot. Other things I didn't really know how to process. There was about 45 minutes that could have been cut out. All of QT's movies are self-indulging, but this was a little different. It was unique, but not very clever. Some things happened a little too easily. Surprise ending? I saw it coming. Even when I don't completely connect with a QT movie, I usually respect that he hits the mark he was going for. But this one might have been a little left of the bull's eye. As I mentioned, there's a lot to appreciate and it was a fun ride. With another viewing, I might kick it up to 8 stars, or possibly down to 6.

DELICIOUS,"I'll start by saying that I'm a true Tarantino fangirl. I even have a Hanzo tattoo. Even so, a couple of his movies have left me feeling out of sorts, not because of the campy violence, but because of certain depictions of cruelty. I don't like mean. So, along comes 'HOLLYWOOD' and I know very well that if ever a story had cause to be mean as hell, it's this one. Still, I was stupid excited, as I am before every new Tarantino flick. As is my habit, I avoided all trailers and commercials; I wanted to be surprised, even though I was anxious about how Quentin would handle the tragic ending (don't worry - no spoilers in this review!).As we all know, QT's ego is the size of a planet, so I was concerned that he might botch this heart-breaking historic tale. What if he made light of a very real tragedy? What if he turned a sobering true crime into a cartoon? I mentally and emotionally prepared myself for the potentiality of an epic disappointment. But I needn't have worried. Thank you, Quentin.It's difficult to write about this film without pointing out every. lovely. thing. The streets, the cars, the marquees, the clothes, even the dirt, as a tire rolls to a stop. Chapped lips. Scars. The texture of hair as it moves on the breeze. Dirty feet. The plink of a maraschino cherry in a cocktail. How does QT do it? It's beautiful, this movie. He works his magic with the actors, too. They are transcendent (who is this fascinating man and what has he done with the real Brad Pitt?). In a word, this movie is.. MATURE. Quentin is finally growing up.The film is a meal. Some have described the pace as boring, but I would describe it as delicious. The story takes its sweet-ass time to simmer, then invites the audience to savor every bite, to relish each complex flavor. After seeing it, I couldn't stop thinking about it for days. Bits of dialogue and snapshot images kept floating through my mind, as if they were distant memories from my own life.. maybe because I was born in '65 and the sounds and images from that era so easily transported me back to my childhood. No, it was more than that.. there was a FEELING.. it was a sense memory, a thing indescribable.Remember when you were a kid, when 'going to the movies' was magical? The smell of the theater, the strangers in the surrounding seats, that feeling of excitement about the whole experience. It was like that. I haven't felt that way about a movie since I was a kid. God, it was GREAT. What a ride! Two weeks later, I went back to see it again and it was even better, because I knew what to expect and I wasn't distracted by my own anxiety. Instead, I was able to completely suspend my disbelief and in so doing, I caught a million beautiful details that I'd missed the first time. I'm going back again, before it leaves the theater.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

Once Upon a Time ...driving around Hollywood circa 1969,"I wasn't as excited to see this movie as I have with most Tarantino movies, especially since I heard from a friend who's opinion I value, that it wasn't very good, so my expectations were low. I heard most people walked out 75% through, which is unfortunate, since the end makes up for what the rest is lacking. If it wasn't for Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) then the movie would have been much worse. I understand that people loved this movie, especially people from Hollywood and rabid Tarantino fans, where he m could make a movie filmed entirely on the female characters feet, and he'd be called a genius. Now the 3 main scenes with Cliff are excellent. However 75% of the movie is clips from shows and movies that don't exist. There is a lot of painfully long driving scenes as well. I think that Tarantino had a simple idea, and made a fictional version of 1969, that takes place in the Tarantino universe. I get that character development is important, however, an actor having a career crisis does not need long clips of his previous work shown to the audience, firsthand. Maybe they could have been in the background of scenes where things are actually happening. It's also not important to show in almost real time, how long it takes to get to Cliff's apartment from Rick's (DiCaprio) house. I think this movie has a few good scenes, and a great take on certain things from Tarantino's universe, and the rest is filler. What about the party? Mostly with people who play famous people, and that's all they do in the movie (aka Damien Lewis as Steve McQueen). Not essential to the movie. The scene could have been cut and the movie would have been fine. Same with a character going to the movies. It just goes on and on. If you take out all the filler, you have maybe a 45 minute movie. All that being said, I really did like this movie for what it ended up being. I just wish there was more content relevant to the main story. Cliff's backstory, and character could have been developed much more! They left a big stigma with his character, ambiguous. I know this was probably intentional, but when you have long clips of Rick's shows, and movies, or long pointless driving scenes, it seems like you'd go to character development that the audience would actually be curious about. This film is probably his most pretentious, and with the exception of the 3 main scenes with Cliff (which made the movie) it was very bland.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

Style can only carry a film so far,"I really didn't expect to dislike 'Once Upon a Time in... Hollywood'. It's a Tarantino movie so it is still well above the average film, at least in terms of quality of production. But to say it was a disappointment would be an understatement. All the great things that are apparent in every Tarantino movie were missing, at least for the first 2 hours of the film. The problems stemmed from the fact that this was a character study, rather than being plot driven. Tarantino is usually so good at combining the two together, so for him to completely ignore one of those elements is a real shame.The film is almost 3 hours long and it simply doesn't have the pacing to justify that. I lost count of the scenes where, after they'd finished, I thought to myself how easy it would have been to leave that on the cutting room floor. So many scenes were setting things up for later in the movie, which is fine and has to be done, but none of them had any creativity to keep them interesting. We simply had to listen to long boring conversations.Finally after a couple of hours a very intense and well-crafted scene involving Brad Pitt's character at a ranch happens. It's arguably the best scene in the film and all I could think was, where has this been? There is no doubt that Pitt and Leo DiCaprio carry this film big time. Without their acting talents this film would have been unbearable. Pitt especially was the best thing this movie had going for it. The film does its best to redeem itself in the final half hour or so, by then the damage was already done. This is my least favourite Tarantino film to date I'm sad to say.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

It follows the normal lives of several people living in Hollywood - well at least the kind of normal you can expect from actors and stuntmen - and at some point it's also touching and interesting, but overall doesn't goes anywhere. One particular character grows and change along the storyline, but everyone else stays just the same or worse is never seen again.Tarantino also makes tons of reference to movie industry and self-references to his own movies - including Pussycat and various foot fetish - but I'm not really into this kind of things and I don't believe they can make a great movie when core aspects are lacking.It's an ok movie, but not something I'd want to watch again.

If you want a deeper story with more of a point to it, however, you might leave this experience feeling somewhat disappointed.Ostensibly, this movie tells two concurrent stories that eventually overlap with each other: Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) is an aging former Western star who is struggling to get acting work and stay relevant. The same goes for his stunt man Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), who chauffeurs him around and is somewhat of a confidant. At the same time, young actress Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) is experiencing a rapid climb to LA success. As I said, eventually these plotlines converge when the Manson Clan begins to factor more heavily into the story.In terms of aesthetic, Once Upon A Time... absolutely hits it out of the park. The music of the time provides an incredible soundtrack, the cinematography is impressive (as per the usual Tarantino style), and the entire experience convincingly plops the viewer into ""Old Hollywood"". The actors all nail their parts (with a star-studded cast like this, how could they not?!) and during the entire 160 minute runtime there is a good mix of drama, comedy, and action/adventure. A special shout-out needs to go to Margaret Qualley, whose hippy/cult character utterly commands every scene she is in.The main problem I had with the movie, though, was that it didn't seem to have much of a point or purpose from beginning to end. There is so much going on from scene to scene that viewers will likely not be bored, per se, but there seems to be an ephemeral approach to the overall goals of the picture. It just sort of drifts from plot to plot, with the aesthetics filling in the gaps instead of well-crafted, plot-driven writing.In fact, I would argue it commits a rather cardinal sin of assuming the audience knows the story behind some of its true-to-life figures (such as Ms. Tate). Because director Tarantino often plays with or subverts the expectations of the history books, there is a heavy degree of assumption that audiences will know ""the facts"" of what actually happened to these historical figures. I did not know this information, and thus was rather confused by some of the in-film events taking place (especially the ending). Now that I've done a little post-credits research I understand better what Tarantino was trying to accomplish, but during the watching experience I often found myself lost.Overall, I can say I was entertained by Once Upon A Time... but little more. It was fun to see such star acting power all grouped together, and Tarantino is good enough at his craft to make sure it doesn't completely fall apart, but there was a lot here that I just couldn't relate to because it assumed a modicum of knowledge that I did not possess. Maybe I'm the outlier here and others will follow along better than me, but for the under-40 set I feel like it might be a challenge without a history brush-up.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

"The more you appreciate cinema as an art, the more you will like this film","I would like to preface this review by expressing that I didn't particularly love this film as much as I expected to. Like many others, Tarantino is one of my favorite directors. I respect his fundamental consistency and his creative license above all else, and he lets both of those aspects shine through brightly in his 9th undertaking. It was this particular flavor of storytelling that he used this time around that I wasn't fond of. There was nothing difficult to follow about it, but it just didn't want to piece itself together into any coherent arcs. I can certainly appreciate that this was the feel Tarantino was going for, but it was not one I could appreciate during my viewing. With that being said, the story wraps up into a bizarre, unique, and satisfying conclusion that reminded me why I will always be in theaters for this director. What makes Tarantino so great is that he maintains such sound film fundamentals when taking on these strange and creative projects. His actors blew their roles out of the water, his cinematographer enhanced their potent performances further, and his set/costume decorators crafted a world of immersion. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is not a film everyone will love, but it is a film everyone should see.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Nothingness,I probably shouldn't even write a review because I only got half way through it and stopped watching because it was too boring. Every single scene and every line meant nothing and I had no interest in any character. And after reading reviews that were saying the same thing I didn't want to waste more of my time. Just another movie trying to rely on the actors to sell a movie but with no plot or interesting script even that couldn't save them.,,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Script lacking teeth!!,"Not sure what all of the great reviews are about?? The first 2 hours had a couple of good scenes with Brad Pitt facing off against Bruce Lee and dealing with a hippy farm. Other than those 2 scenes the movie was very flat until the climax - which was awesome, but not good enough to compensate for the rest of the movie. The cinematography was excellent along with the retro feel. I'm used to Tarantino creating more tension throughout the whole movie and it just wasn't there. I'm glad I watched in on my Regal unlimited pass 😎",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
GENIUS!!!! BEST MOVIE ALL TIME,"This is absolutely my new favorite movie of all time. The performance, the plot, the tones in the film. Everything just works together and I cannot imagine it any better. You either hate the movie or you love it. Brad Pitt and Leonardo Decaprio have a beautiful bromance and Margot Robbie plays Sharon Tate to the T. Even the way the movie was filmed the angles and scenes were just jaw dropping. The car scene at the beginning definitely sets the tone and the Easter eggs pay homage to the final days of the Golden age of Hollywood. I highly highly suggest watching a documentary on the Manson Family if you're not familiar with the story because There are subtle shots throughout the movie and characters that play major role in the plot and the actual real events that you would not catch. The ending was just fantastic and Brad Pitt nailed it. It might be slow for some people but for me the pacing was perfect even with the actual events the Manson Family cult started off as peace love hippies and Charles Manson over the years turned on Hollywood after they rejected him for his failed music career which correlates with the narrative. You have to know the story to get the movie. But yeah the movie was absolutely brilliant and incredible acting.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
They don't make em like they used to,"For years now Hollywood's biggest obsession has been pushing technology and replacing story narratives with CGI beams in the sky. Tarantino takes us back to a different time, one where actors and story carried the film and boy does this one nail those better than any I've seen in a long time. If you're a fan of great storytelling and a journey this era simply denies to offer go see this movie! Laugh and sit in awe of someone who cares about the subject matter and remember what it feels like to love a movie again!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Who needs a plot?,"There was only one movie last year that left me with such mixed feelings and that was the Suspiria re-imagining. Prior to that, and now this, I can't remember the last time I felt so 50/50 on a film. These are rare cases.I imagine this will be the most polarizing film of 2019 - to me, I feel like it's designed to be.First, the positive: It's very hard not to be entertained by the acting chops of both Brad Pitt and The Nardo. They bring it as hard as they always do, and their characters offer just enough to separate themselves from the rest of these guys' back catalogue. These two manage to take what is basically ""not a movie"", carry it, and keep it thoroughly entertaining. Pitt's character was my favorite, and just got better and better as the movie played out. Tarantino clearly put a lot of thought into the set pieces and design, and some of the editing, to really transport back to that 1969 vibe - it's effective and usually a lot of fun. All Spahn Ranch-affiliated characters were the most exciting part of the film, specifically one prolonged sequence that occurs at the ranch itself. That was just about the ONLY scene in the movie that provided any real tension or ""purpose"". Finally, some things occur in the final act that are undeniably satisfying and electrically entertaining - this scores the film a bit of redemption, but 10 minutes cannot save a 160 minute experience alone.Then, the not so positive: first and foremost, there is no plot. Yeah, an aging actor is insecure that his career is starting to tank... but, most scenes have little to nothing to do with that, and there is literally no other conflict in the entire movie. And it's not some surrealist, abstract, atmosphere-driven experience...it's just meandering, throughout. Still entertaining the whole time, just...meandering. Next, Margot Robbie may as well not be in the movie at all. She has maybe 5 or 6 lines, across maybe 4 scenes, and her longest scenes are, in my opinion, some of the most purposeless and ineffective scenes in the entire movie (her watching her own movies in a theater, alone, for a long time?). Kind of a bummer when you have someone as talented and beautiful as Margot Robbie, playing someone as legendary as Sharon Tate, and you get just about nothing from it. Next, there is NO reason for this movie to be 160 minutes long. We don't need 3-minute establishing shots, watching people drive cars from one place to another, as the intro to EVERY scene, especially when what we're prefacing are scenes like Brad Pitt getting up on the roof to fix an antenna in real time... for no reason. It reminded me of the panning shots of San Fransisco in The Room or of the creek in A Talking Cat?! - you could cut out a solid half hour of establishing shots and unnecessary long shots and you'd still have the exact same (plotless) movie. I could go on.I certainly consider myself a huge Tarantino fan. The Hateful Eight was the first movie of his that I did not enjoy. This was an odd one, and overall I would say that I liked it, but I can't imagine having this script and being like ""okay! That's it!"" - we have all the money, all the power, and all the A-listers to do WHATEVER we want with this movie, but THIS is what we're gonna do! Perhaps though, that is exactly what's going to make this special in the long run.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

This Movie Will Not Be the typical Tarantino Fest,"I wouldn't say this movie is like any Tarantino film. It really has no plot whatsoever, it's just kind of a chill movie. You kind of hang with these characters for a couple of days and watch 1969 Hollywood. It is almost like watching a documentary of 1969 Hollywood. I feel this maybe the most grounded Tarantino flick yet.The acting is top notch. Leo gives the best performance of his entire career. It is the first performance without any signs of a normal ""Leo Performance"". Brad Pitt steals the show in every scene. He IS CLIFF BOOTH. Everyone else does a magnificent job. Shout out to whoever played Bruce Lee because, WOW, they were fantastic.This movie will divide a lot of people. It has no real story, and it's more of just watch these guys do life. The only part with actual story is the last 15 mins, which is when the most TARANTINO parts occur. For the most part though, the movie is kind of just, watch these two likeable guys do stuff. It's entertaining, and never really a drag. I know a lot of people didn't like it as much because it has no real plot. People say like Pulp Fiction is no plot, but that isn't true. This movie. This movie has no plot, but it's still entertaining. I think it's the least Tarantino, tarantino film, and it's why it was truly refreshing.It's gonna divide people, but if you appreciate cinema, I IMPLORE YOU to go see this.

Overrated as per usual!,"Tarantino has become so arrogant to think that he can produce any kind of rubbish and put it on screen and he'll still have his hardcore fans that will appreciate any film that has any relation to Tarantino. Put Tarantino's name on some of the worst films out there and they'd all 10 star them! This film was so utterly boring, except the last 30 minutes, which was absolutely brilliant, that's what the two stars are for because if you average it out, 30 minutes of a 2 hour 40 minute film (one star for every 16 good minutes that I watch) then it deserves 2 of them, and that's being generous! However, maybe I should give an extra star for him not having a cameo in the movie as his cameos are unnecessary, embarrassing and out of place. He needs to realise that he is NOT an actor! I went into this film with high hopes as I love the actors and I like some of his previous films like Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs etc. And also enjoy stories around famous criminals like Charles Manson, which can I say, his story arc was about 40 minutes of the entire film and he was only in it for a total of 10 seconds!",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Over hyped movie,I just saw this movie and there is not a story it drags for two hours the acting is decent nothing for a Oscar worthy in my opinion the last 30 minutes of the movie are the best!

A stunning ode to Hollywood and La La Land,"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood might just be Tarantino's most accomplished film to date. Masterfully directed, with one of the most satisfying endings to a film. The script is deliberately long and fletched out, with multiple overlong scenes that add brilliant depth to a stunning film. The razor sharp dialogue adds to an already stunningly beautiful film. As great as Brad Pitt is in this, Leonardo DiCaprio just proved why he is Hollywood's golden boy. A performance many won't appreciate fully, but DiCaprio really shines and gives a performance reminiscent of old Hollywood where actors understand characterization and emotive scenes.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

This is the first movie I've seen in the theater that actually put me to sleep, and I suffered through Hellboy.

The name of the movie really makes sense as you walk out of the theatre. The writing is superb and even when you think you've figured it out and know what's going to happen it switches on you. One of Tarantino's best, if not his best movie of all time. For sure one of the best performances I've seen from Leo, Brad Pitt, and Margot Robbie in their careers.

Requires Multiple Viewing,"I had seen the trailer to Once Upon a Time..in Hollywood and was sure I would like it and was sure it would be more of the typical Tarantino offering. I came away totally confused. While it had some of the usual QT trademarks - the killer soundtrack, the attention to detail, the multiple story lines, - it had something more, I just wasn't sure what it was. I did like the film but probably wouldn't have put it next to his greatest work. But there were things that keep coming back to me in the following days, a kind of delayed realization of certain scenes and dialogue, what the movie was trying to say. I was already loving it more and knew I'd have to rewatch it. So today I went and saw it again and I have to say, this may well be one of the finest movies I've ever seen. It's a 10, a masterpiece in every sense of the word. The writing, the casting, the soundtrack, the cinematography - all flawless - and I haven't even mentioned the acting!

You need to enter this world, and not only the worlds of the two leads (played by DiCaprio and Pitt, and they are both relaxed - for the most part - and hilarious i spots). You are transported to Hollywood, August 1969. And Tarantino gets everything right, from the look of Hollywood at the time, the movie marquees, the music, the clothes, the attitudes.
Like some of this other films, the movie takes many liberties with historic events. The last shot of the film allows audiences to fill in the blanks as to what happens next.

In fact, if you didn't know Tarantino wrote and directed this, you would be none the wiser after watching the film. It's set in the fall of 1969, shortly before the infamous Tate-LaBianca murders in Hollywood, and it (mostly) follows the travails of a has-been TV actor named Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his longtime friend and stunt double, Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt). Dalton used to be the star of a show called Bounty Law, a western in which his character is sort of an antihero, but the show ended its run when Dalton wanted to strike out for the presumably greener pastures of movies. Now he's kind of washed up, working as a guest star on current shows as the bad guy. Meanwhile, his buddy Cliff is sort of Rick's gopher, his own career derailed by his actions on the set of The Green Hornet. Completing the trio - although separately - is actress Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie), wife of director Roman Polanski, who lives next door to Dalton in the Hollywood Hills. Much of the movie has to do with everyday life for these three in 1969 Hollywood, and there are a ton of movie references - sort of a Tarantino hallmark. But as Dalton, Booth, and Tate go about their lives, nothing really stands out as...well, interesting or full of any meaning for the audience. What probably was meant to be a lot of little scenes leading up to a fantastic conclusion was really a bunch of vignettes. The casting is as eclectic as we've come to expect from Quentin Tarantino, but the script doesn't really make use of anyone save for DiCaprio. Pitt and Robbie aren't given a lot to do other than look pretty, and talent like Al Pacino, Brenda Vaccaro, Damien Lewis, and Bruce Dern are paid very short shrift. The whole thing feels like imitation Tarantino and is definitely not among his best work. This is a dull movie, even with the ""revised history"" slant it tries to present.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

You MUST see this. It's 241 min of romance tempered by tough nostalgia.,"Twenty-five years after Pulp Fiction, Quentin Tarantino is still getting our attention. Today in Once Upon a Time . . . in Hollywood he takes a calmer, less sardonic view of the passage of cultural time from The Graduate, Easy Rider, Midnight Cowboy, and other great '60's classics and the future '70's greats like Taxi Driver, Star Wars, and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. The Hollywood mojo was impressive in those decades, and he loves it all.By focusing on almost has-been TV star Rick (Leo DiCaprio) and his stunt double (Brad Pitt), writer/director Tarantino can be wistful about a Hollywood that has reached its peak in the 60's and hard-nosed about the wars like Vietnam and murders like Manson's to temper the almost giddy love of movies divorced from reality. Never is he sappy or sarcastic, just mindful throughout of the passage of time and innocence.In the 2 hrs 41 min, however, he doesn't cut scenes when he should such as the re-creation of old TV show segments just too long and dull to be anything but slow. However, when the two stars are together the magic of old Hollywood is present, even if they can't compete with Newman and Redford.Never one to rely just on meticulous re-creation of an era (his details are marvelous), Tarantino plays with the lost innocence motif, even with war raging on TV and producers assassinating the careers of stars. Still, this is a milder, gentler Tarantino, unlike Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, for instance. As a loving take on violence and loss, he allows himself to honor the movies, from when he was a nerdy, video geek to a formidable auteur.See this romantic rendition of the sixties by arguably one of the best artists in the world. At the least it's entertaining, at the best it blends our benign nostalgia with the evanescence of fame, beauty, and peace.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Worst Tarantino Movie,"I'm a big fan of Tarantino movies, but I have to admit that this is his worst movie, a waste of a brilliant cast, for a movie without purpose. The typical Tarantino ending was meaningless in this movie, it looks like we're watching two different styles, one that happens throughout the whole movie, and one in the final scene. Very boring movie. The usual phenomenon of ""high scoring film just because the director is reputable"", I realize that it should make people feel intellectual by always giving good marks to well-known filmmakers, but it really misleads those who are guided by IMDB scores. If this movie were from a lesser known director the IMDB score would probably be 5/6.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

Tarantino's nostalgic tribute to Hollywood.. or his own career..,"I'm a big fan of Tarantino's films. So, I was excited to see his ""ninth film."" This movie was clearly a work of craftsmanship. All the elements were there. The acting was absolutely on point. Leonardo DiCaprio gave us passion, development, remorse, and discovery. Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie, Margaret Qualley, and the rest were all pitch perfect. Cinematography, editing, sound, all masterfully dealt, as one would expect. The writing... well.. the dialog, was there. But, what about the story? A movie doesn't need a plot, but a good movie always has something to say. So what was this film trying to say? (Besides being an ad for the tobacco industry)
That's where this film started to diverge from his earlier work. There wasn't much gratuitous violence (until the end). While each scene was interesting to watch as a crafted slice-of-life biopic, without the over-the-top theatrics, it got, at 2h 41m, frankly a bit boring. I've seen people walk out of his films from shock value; I could see them walking out of this one for boredom. It did hew closely to his template as a historical what-if revenge. This time around, it was the Charles Manson murders. Unfortunately, I didn't know this going in and, not having lived through it, I wasn't versed in the details. So, unlike his previous forays into nazis, slavers, bounty hunters, etc., the context wasn't as universally familiar. I needed to find something else to resonate. It also feels at this point that the revenge-twist climax is Tarantino on writing auto-pilot. I think at heart, this was really just a nostalgia film.
Also unfortunately for me, I didn't live through and couldn't relate to Hollywood in the late 60s, nor do I have a desire for that brand of misogyny. Maybe I'm just too young to really appreciate this film? Sharon Tate's character was sweet and innocent and showed her potential; but it had thin writing and little development. Maybe that was the point. Margot has the chops, but the empowerment of Pam Grier or Uma Thurman was sorely missing as the male leads save the day for his shrieking and flailing real-life wife Daniela Pick.
I suppose this flick gives a window into another time and place... But really, the best I garnered from it was that, on another level, it was actually a self-allegory. A nostalgia not just for Hollywood, but a tribute for Tarantino's own career and films (it was quite replete with insider references). How fitting that the main character was wrestling with fear of being washed up and past his prime. Is this some self-awareness of Tarantino's own insecurities? Unfortunately, I fear this movie makes it a self-fulfilling prophecy...",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

provocative,"Each film by Quentin Tarantino is provocative. But in this case, the test is more tough because the first large part of the movie has high chances to be boring or so far by what you expect. But this is its fundamental virtue / a galery of portraits, nice, realistics, eccentrics , proposing not only a hommage to old Hollywood but reflection about cinema . The portrait of Sharon Tate is one of the precious gifts of the film. The admirable work and fine collaboration between Brad Pitt and Leonardo di Caprio is other. Sure, in the last part, what you expect, you have.

A Bonkers Tarantino Fairy-Tale with Golden-Age Hollywood Nostalgia,"A bonkers fairy tale in classically-Tarantino fashion with pure nostalgia-hued Golden Age-Hollywood homages, soundtrack as provocative as its brilliant screenplay, star-studded cast of stellar performances, & wild final act. 9.4/10....Review: 1960's: Manson x Golden-Age (leading into Renaissance/New Age) Hollywood. That was the tall order we were promised by legendary filmmaker Quentin Tarantino for his 9th outing, one made even more tantalizing by the trailer & announcement of a once-in-a-lifetime cast from Leonardo DiCaprio to Brad Pitt to Margot Robbie. After such inimitable masterpieces as Django Unchained, The Hateful Eight, Kill Bill Vols. 1/2, Inglorious Basterds, Reservoir Dogs, and Pulp Fiction, the film world's eyes were all on July 25th like the premiere of any blockbuster film in its namesake ritzy town's backdrop, and Tarantino delivered yet again - Oh *boy*, did he deliver. A bonkers fairy tale in classically-Tarantino fashion with pure nostalgia-hued Golden-Age Hollywood homages, soundtrack as provocative as its brilliant screenplay, star-studded cast of sensational performances, & wild final act, Once Upon A Time in Hollywood is one of Tarantino's greatest films ever.Nostalgia to Hollywood's Golden Age with plenty of Easter Eggs and eulogies to filmmaking. What's easily the highlight of OUATIH is its golden paean esteems and invocation of the best of Hollywood's history through every sensory way imaginable. It's truly like taking a joyride through the annals of film archives and will smack a goofy grin on any cinephile's face for its ~3 hour time period that flickers by in a flash. More classic film posters, TV serial snippets, lunchboxes, vinyl-pop, and radio-ads than can possibly be mentioned with meticulous attention to detail and period-authenticity make for a sensational trip through the escapist fare of moviemaking's best era. It even features clever fourth-wall-breaking/meta references to the artform showing (with classic Tarantino whim, wry humor, and unmistakeable energy) the process of filmmaking with everything from messed-up lines, cuts, shot-reversals, and replays of scenes as people come together across specialties to try to create filmic products that stand the test of the time.The cinematography to soundtrack to location settings majestically paint the glamour and ritzy lives of the rich and famous in Hollywood Hills' idyllic settings as promised - only to be shaken up by the events of its equally-brilliant screenplay. Paralleling all this settings-glamour is an equally dazzling display of storytelling with rich characters who make the film. The screenplay is masterful - this is pantheon-level filmmaking here - juggling 3-4+ storylines simultaneously with ease before uniting them all for the wild signature final act as promised by QT's filmography. We are taken through Hollywood studio backlots with insecure has-been movie star Rick Dalton trying desparately to save his career, a juxtaposed-rougher lifestyle for his sacrificial stunt-double Cliff Booth, trophy wife/model Sharon Tate jumping between romances in LA-superficiality fashion, and a Manson cult arc creeping under the surface like a serial killer slipping between the cracks.The performances. Leonardo DiCaprio absolutely (predictively) steals the show as lead with one of his most hilarious and out-there performances to date; Pitt is equally as infectious in personality as support with an intriguing exposure of the double-standard in film treatment between the people just ""reading lines other people wrote for them"" and those doing the dangerous stuntwork behind-the-scenes (also makes an iconic buddy-duo that needs its own couple of films with these two legendary actors tossed together for an extremely unique, refreshing mix!), Margot is a nice soothing juxtaposition storyline undeniably a treat for the eyes while also given a mini-romance arc with potentially-catastrophic results, and there is not a weak link to be found in the rest of the cast/cameos as the story escalates and twists until the final act as bravato-filled, wild, and bonkers as could only be found in a Tarantino film.The final act. One of the craziest final acts I can remember of late - only really rivalled by other Tarantino films as a signature big boom ending characteristic of his filmography, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood ends with a tremendous bang that adds triumphant final punctuation to this bonkers fairy tale set in the nightlit views of the motion picture capital. Immaculately tying all story threads together while also leaning heavy into its Manson arc with his cult trying to break in and kill some socialites in the Hollywood Hills on beckon-command, they meet a much different ending than they anticipated for MAXIMUM drink-spitting entertainment value - with everything from flamethrowers to butcher knives to dog-attacks to sleeping pills to incessant yells. What's even more impressive in the finale and throughout the film is that Tarantino absolutely silences any of his (imbecilic) critics/detractors claiming his films have ""too much gore/cussing"" (he's stayed true to his promised style of brazen irreverency since PULP FICTION, fools) by shockingly having almost none of what was perfectly licenseable to have given it's a film set around the events of the Manson murders: gore and violence. Instead we are just taken on a ~3-hour road trip amenable to all discernible tastes through masterful characteristic Old-World storytelling any real film aficionado can bask in the glory of for hours.Minor flaws in Once Upon A Time in Hollywood include a comparatively-smaller role for Margot Robbie than was expected and Manson arc I wish was a little more pronounced/fleshed-out. Margot is only really shown in glimpses and not utilized nearly to the full of her considerable acting talents, and we only get one actual glimpse of Charlie Manson (a perfect look-alike as well nonetheless) and few glimpses of his cult until the spectacularly-entertaining ending I really wish had gotten more screentime for its massive EV-value. Even a couple of slasher scenes or teases placed throughout would've done the trick, perhaps in place of some of the nostalgia-leaning in the first act that's undeniably enchanting but might've been better served for a bit more balance....Overall, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood is a masterpiece and one of Tarantino's best films to date - an incredible feat given his already-illustrious filmography that keeps getting one-upped every outing he gives. A bonkers fairy tale in classically-Tarantino fashion with pure nostalgia-hued Golden-Age Hollywood homages, soundtrack as provocative as its brilliant screenplay, star-studded cast of sensational performances, & wild final act, OUATIH cements Tarantino as easily one of the Top 3 Directors of All-Time in my book, as well as one of the greatest auteurs and most influential/inimitable masterminds the medium has ever seen.Overall Score: 9.4/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

It was a love story about friendship and honor. What others said was too much jumping around wasn't really paying attention. It clearly stated the dates of what was happening.

Go see it... Twice.,"QT delivers big league. Forget the disappointing Hateful Eight. His classic vignette-style moviemaking is in full effect though presented differently than most of his previous work. The dialogue we love is there but is not so conscious of itself as usual. QT serves up some subversively sexy shots of Pitt and Robbie, just a little cherry on top for his audience.Thanks QT for gifting us a movie starring Pitt and DiCaprio. Reality and fiction blur in more ways than one. The QT universe hums quietly in the background ready to dish out more Easter eggs at every turn.One critic said this movie is like a time machine. I agree. It's an immersive experience. The characters have heart. I learned to love Rick Dalton as his story unfolds. Pitt's stuntman Cliff Booth is the real star, his story is where real life is taking place.Every performance is beyond satisfactory. The soundtrack is a dream. The color saturation and cinematography is all you'd expect from QT and then some. I wanted to see this film again immediately and plan to today.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Not the best. Not the worst either.,"The biggest difference between Tarantinos earlier movies, as opposed to his most recent(Hateful 8 & Once upon a time...) is in his earlier films, you are immediately pulled into the story. You are immersed in the characters' personality and you hang on to every word they say, because everything they said was interesting or part of the story, or both!His more recent films have little to none if that. Although they are great movies, they no longer follow an incohesive story where you are always eager to know what happens next. Hateful 8 and Once upon a time spend too much time building the world the characters are in, and get lost along the way. The stories take too long to reveal themselves, and the action is few and far between.Tarantino did make another good film, but sadly they are nothing like his first few, and very subpar to Kill Bill, one of his best films. He needs to go back to solid action and crime with amazing dialogue. That was always his greatest strengths, and its sadly not here.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

Not great (last half) but not bad (first half) either,"Given my title, it's surprising that I gave this a 6/10 or 3/5, which for me means below average but not bad either. A lot of reviews are either 8-9/10 or really low which emphasise the love it or hate it nature, I've tried to be fair.I was really excited to watch this after hearing of the initial response it got and high rating of 9.5+/10. I made the mistake of forgetting that just because critics love a movie, regular folk may not.I want to start by saying I have no criticism to the acting of this film. Di Caprio brilliantly plays an actor who I can only describe as knowing his best days are over and the drink he needs to cope with this. Pitt is his stunt double and chauffeur who comes to his own in the latter half. Margot, well she really doesn't do much, again that's not her fault.The problem with OUATIH is mainly the plot and slow pace. All of this would have been forgiven had the main scene the film builds up to been more accurate. Instead you get the feeling of being underwhelmed by it despite this being a fictionalised version of events.To my final point, the critics seem to love Tarantino and this kind of movie, I just feel the average movie goer will not. If this was on TV, I would have changed the channel after around half an hour. Which then makes me think that QT has employed Di Caprio and Pitt to draw people in to watch the film. I went into this as a fan of Leo who if someone else was cast in his place, I probably would not have been interested. Having said that, if Christopher Nolan was directing, it could have had a load of nobodies in and I would still watch it.If you got this far, I'm a huge Leonardo Di Caprio fan and his acting was really good. Not brilliant or award winning mind you. Despite that, I feel like I'm doing an injustice by giving this 6/10. I can't think of another movie of his that I've watched and thought of as this low.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

The last half an hour or so sees the film go up several gears, the ending was great, the best part of the film.The major strengths here, the visuals, if you love the sixties, this will appeal to you, it looks incredible, the visuals are sublime. The acting is awesome, not a single quibble from me about the acting, DiCaprio is absolutely superb, and deserving of accolades.A good story, the issue for me was pacing, the story takes time to hot up, and if I'm honest, beging to knit together.It's a good film, you just need to stick with it. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

The ending presented what we all wish could've happened in 8/69. I never saw it coming til the Spahn ranch car pulled away from Cielo Drive, leaving 3 not 4 to do the dirty work. And I'll stop here.

Very refreshing if you're tired of generic movie formulas,"This is the first Tarantino film I've seen since I'm not so good with violence, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that this movie blew my expectations out of the water. In my opinion, it was well-shot, with great acting, and kept you wondering what's going on. As a viewer, I had no idea what direction the story was going in, and that, for me, was really refreshing. It felt like seeing an interesting snippet (albeit a long snippet) of a longer story. Personally, I'm sick of predictable same-formula movies, and I loved that I just didn't know what was coming, so I enjoyed every little bit for what it was.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Vey unique! Not normal 'entertainment blockbuster',"Went in with zero expectations and only the minimal scope of what it entails. The cast is spot on as usual, and the performances are sublime. They all really get the chance to shine. The sets, etc, wow.. your right back in the 60s in all its glory. Love how Tarantino took this one, done many sub stories that didn't go anywhere, but didn't to. Really can understand how someone could not enjoy this, so glad I'm not one of them. Right up there with his best..Tarantino = legend",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
The power of the near last energy,Fun and also twist of the fate of Sharon Tate. Great creation of Rick Dalton & Cliff Booth,10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
A love letter to Hollywood is right.,"Tarrentino was right when he said this movie is a love letter to Hollywood. Except not 1969 Hollywood, but modern Hollywood. The Hollywood in which films; just by their name and actors within it, can generate multitudes of money despite the fact that they are not good. And Hollywood has also found a way to skew the ratings on the major sites to make you think it's good and see it , even if you don't for some crazy reason like the name or actors of the film you will see.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
A contrived story without a narrative core.,"In a year of generally mediocre films it is not difficult to stand out, especially if your name is Quentin Tarantino. Whether the critical acclaim heaped on Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019) is warranted or not depends on your taste for films without a narrative core that ooze melodramatic nostalgia and blur the transient realities of watching movies about making movies.The plotline unfolds in slow motion and when it finally does, it is largely inconsequential. The story is based around the declining career of a 1950s B-grade Western actor called Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) whose last chance is to capitalise on the popularity of 'spaghetti westerns'. His alter ego and long-time double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) is the real thing: a war veteran and martial arts expert whose role in life is to make Rick believe in himself, despite the truth. Within this loose cinematic frame, the film meanders from skit to skit without the connective tissue that makes for purposeful or coherent storytelling. It builds a two and a half hour filmic scaffold that culminates in ten gruesome minutes loosely based on the Charles Manson-inspired murder of Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie).The only lingering after-effect of seeing this film is to question why it was made at all. Neither of the buddy stars are likeable people: Rick is self-serving, weak and shallow, and Cliff doubles up on these qualities and adds a taste for violence. Their acting is understandably old-school and contrived. Sharon is paraded as the film's visual centrepiece, a role she fills remarkably well despite being given a script that renders her practically dumb. The relationship between the buddies, the Manson cult, and the murders is non-existent other than to imply that nothing needs to make sense if it is linked to Hollywood.The sole redeeming feature of this film is its forensic attention to reproducing the sets, fashion, styles, and social mores of the 1960s. The archival television and movie footage recreate the ambience and ambivalence of the cultural upheaval that we now refer to as the 'golden era' or 'heyday' of film and television. While this will appeal to many, others will be distracted by the film's fractured storyline and its contrived vignettes of the past.
Blending history, fantasy, and entertainment is Tarantino's ultimate purpose. His message is simple: the fairy tale of Hollywood is and has always been a chimera.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Best Quentin Tarantino Ending Ever,"When you watch it you'll feel like you're transported back in time when Bruce Lee & Steve McQueen were bigger than life.

Not Tarantino for his 90s fans.,"This movie appears to be splitting critics for some obvious reasons which are nothing to do with the quality of whats on offer.
This is not the 90s wham bam constant action to a groovy soundtrack with multiple plot twists Tarantino movie.
If thats what you think you are getting you will be disappointed. This is a more mature and skilled Tarantino affair in which your own knowledge of cinema will be rewarded if you have that background. Think of Marvel Easter eggs but for film buffs.
This is a high quality movie which has great dialogue without being overly preachy or Tarantino-esque and lush cinematography.
Its almost 2.45 hours long but doesnt feel too long, unless you were expecting a 90s Tarantino movie.
The mastery of the movie however is the story telling, you simply do not see coming what does and like Hitchcock, Tarantino is fantastic at building up tension. We expect the narrative to go one way however.....
In short you will need to see this before its ruined with spoilers.
It has been attacked on very simplistic, lazy and selfish identity politics reasoning.
We have critics who have attempted to quantize the value of female characters by using the metric of words spoken. However not by all the female characters just by one. Using this metric negates every other aspect of what an actor brings to the screen. If acting was judged on word count alone we would have some very odd looking movies. Its also telling that this highly selective metric is applied to only character. The odd thing is there are far more females in this movie than males. How does that add to the argument this is a sexist movie? Also the female characters are treated exactly the same as the males when they step out of line. If anything this movie does more to enhance the memory of Sharon Tate and extend her screen life than any identity politics rant that ignores facts in order to skew an audiences mind into not seeing the movie. The identity politics advocates real issue is that they did not like seeing women experience violence, they are loath to articulate this clearly so they label the movie as misogenistic. They know that if they did explicitly state this is that there are two main issues with this stance. Firstly that the Manson family are known for the murder of a pregnant woman and her child for no reason and secondly that they would be asking for special treatment for only the female Mansons, that is despite their violent intent they should be spared any violence because they are female. Clearly an immature position based on identity politics and laughably unfair. It appears they would rather see female Manson murderers get away it and receive therapy for their deeds instead of swift justice.
Also the other criticism seems to be about the fact you can see feet in the movie. However thats only an issue for those very odd people who hate feet, despite the fact they also have them.
I actually find these people stranger than foot fetishists.
This movie treats its female characters as equals throughout and enhances the public image of Sharon Tate.
This is a major success for Tarantino in 2019.
Its a very grown up movie for grown ups, ignore the identity politics brigade and the immature I hate feet people!",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
About Hollywood by Hollywood for people who care about Hollywood,"I don't get the fuss about this movie; it is good, but I can't see the masterpiece I hear about. The actors are excellent and, if I enjoyed this movie, it is mostly thanks to the cast. However, this is a movie assumes that the audience knows and cares about actors, directors, Hollywood, and the movie business. I am not a movie buff or celebrity fan, so I couldn't share in the nostalgia, missed the hidden references, and didn't feel any excitement at the depiction of past celebrities. I think if this were a true masterpiece, this movie would grasp the attention of any audience and make anyone care about the characters.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Overhyped and underwhelming - and I usually love Tarrantino Filems,"While I generally love Tarantino films, ""Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood"" left me cold. I was expecting something great. Instead he gives us a bit of a mess filled with forced 1960s references, really forced, unlike ""American Graffiti"" which just melded them into the fabric of the film. Even the afterscene was forced and certainly not worth waiting for.Yes the acting was generally pretty darned good. Yes, the camera work was dazzling. But the film just seemed superficial and artificial.I realize there are plenty of folks who just adored the film and concluded it was innovative and clever beyond belief. I fear those conclusions are as superficial as this film.So if you're a fan of Tarrantino films, this could go either way for you. If you don't buy into the hype, you very well may enjoy it. But iIf you're not a fan of his films, this one isn't likely to turn you into a fan. Better you should rent ""Reservoir Dogs.""",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
The best,It was so funny I love this film. Tarantino is a genius.,10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
A slow-burning love letter to '60s Hollywood,"Tarantino's ninth film reveals his huge love for the Hollywood of 60s, and is heavily loaded with pop culture references of that era, has clever callback moments to his own movies, and several Easter eggs including signature Tarantino shots and brief cameos by legends. One may or may not get these references all the time, but realizing them does make the viewing experience richer, as Tarantino decides to randomly be nice or mean to several reel and real life souls, while neatly altering the history - he himself has never cared about it, so shouldn't you. The Fuhrer of Nazis was killed in a French theater owned by a Jew, remember? So, if something unexpected happens with Bruce Lee or Sharon Tate in this Hollywood world, don't worry about it.The authenticity has been taken care of - the streets, the magazines, the pop style and the background score - these all make the movie constantly emanate the vibe of a grand movie set in L.A. The narration though slow paced, is compelling for the most part. It demands a lot of time to engage one, getting even stagnant at times. What work during these sequences are the amusing dialogues, Robert Richardson's lively cinematography and the apt acting by the entire cast - something not to worry about in a Tarantino movie. This cinematic slow-burner demands your attention. Expect less action and violence, except for the obvious climax.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

Tarantino brought 60s to life,"What can I say except for thank you Quentin. Thank you for that masterpiece that you delivered. New genre is definitely created. Cinematography, choreography and costumography are beyond my expectations. As for the acting goes, it's superior. The chemistry between Brad and Leonardo is awesome. One true bromance. And, of course, let's not forget about Margot as Sharon. She was adorable. Everyone nailed their roles completely.
And I must say special thanks to Leonardo for bringing his character beyond any boundaries. Rick Dalton is officially my favourite movie character. Oh, and the ending is practically breathtaking. Wow, I mean WOW.
But folks, be careful. Why I say that? Simply because not everyone are a fan of the sixties and the vibe that they are bringing. And if you are not familiar with the story of Charles Manson and Manson family you will be genuinely confused. So, take some research before the movie.

BETTER than Typical QT,"I dreaded the length of this film & almost waited for DVD. I was pleasantly surprised at how fast it went b/c it is SO VISUALLY RICH & engaging. Admittedly slower pacing than expected from QT, but the pacing weaves a story & visuals that is ultimately rewarding. Perhaps 20-something's won't appreciate (1) the Hollywood & pop-culture nostalgia, (2) the brilliant music placement choices & (3) Leo's multi-layered, complex portrayal of a ""dying breed"" while simultaneously illustrating the character's shallow, short-sighted self-absorption -- VERY tough job to harness a character who is shown ""acting within the acting."" QT is the master at showing us the most believable fantasy characters & re-imagining how they might interact with our historical realities. I was also dreading the violence b/c wondering how QT could possibly have the stones (and bad taste) to put the real-life murders on the big screen. Everyone knows QT films result in gruesome deaths, but this ending was SO BRILLIANT & satisfying (in a Tarantino way) -- a ""once upon a time"" tale that leaves you wishing it had happened that way in real life. See it on the big screen -- small screen inadequate for enjoying the tightly-packed scenery & depth of textures this film delivers.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

One of TARANTINO'S BEST,"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood - Movie ReviewWhere do I even begin with a movie like this. WoW, just WoW. Quentin Tarantino has out done himself. This is by far the BEST TARANTINO movie. The way he wrote and directed this movie is beyond phenomenal and amazing.Leonardo DiCpario as Rick Dalton was so good. He plays a washed up actor trying to make a name for himself again in 1960s Hollywood. DiCpario captured the essence of this role and played it to a point where this role was better than his role in Django Unchained. DiCaprio one ups himself in every scene he is in and it shows.Brad Pitt as Cliff Booth stole the show and made the movie beyond amazing. The character of Cliff Booth is the Stuntman to Leonardo DiCaprio's Rick Dalton character. The back story that is given to Cliff Booth is intense and shocking so to speak. Brad Pitt from the moment he is shown in this movie just makes the movie better. This is his BEST PERFORMANCE as an Actor and it shows.Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate. The character is not in it all that much. Maybe close to about 15mins of total screen time and that was it. The character really didn't have to be in the movie, but when you see it. You will understand why.Al Pacino finally makes his debut in a Tarantino movie. He plays Marvin Schwarzs a local Hollywood Agent. While Pacino's role was minor, he left a mark on the movie and it was good to see him portray this character.Mike Moh as Bruce Lee, was done so well. He captured the feel and look of Bruce Lee and even sounded like him. There is a great scene between Bruce Lee and Cliff Booth that is both funny and bad ass.Kurt Russell as Randy. Randy is a stunt coordinator for one of Rick Dalton's movies and also serves as the narrator for this movie. As he narrates the movie it's done in a subtle way where it keeps your attention.There are other minor actors in the movie, But they had small parts in the movie to serve as some small backstory to everyone.Now the dog, yes I said dog. The Dog that in this movie is great. I can't say much more about it, but it does play a major role in a few scenes. If there was an Oscar for animals. This Dog would WIN.The music in the movie really takes you back to the 1960s. The way Tarantino captures the feeling and emotion of the music with this story setting is unbelievable and makes the movie work so well.The cinematography in this movie is by far the BEST in any Tarantino movie. The tracking shots were smooth and clean. The editing was good and quick but added to the suspense of the movie. The interior car scenes are the best, as the camera is positioned in the back capturing both Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth.Tarantino has made a movie that is a call back to the 1960s. The ending is by far the best and most shocking. Especially the way it was done, he had intense moments that worked for a movie like this.This is a MUST SEE movie. Especially if you are a Tarantino fan, he knocked it out of the park with this one and it truly shows, and if you are not a Tarantino fan still go see this movie and you will understand why this movie is the BEST movie of 2019.Once upon a Time in Hollywood - Rating 10 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

"A little slow, although unique and enjoyable","Not Tarantino's best film but I still found it worth the watch. The story is one that I'd never really considered 1960s Hollywood. To be honest I thought it was set in 1930s Hollywood when I'd heard about the Golden Age of Hollywood. However, the story did seem very random and strange. Maybe more for Quentins enjoyment than his audience? A film he'd always wanted to make, as part of his 10 movies.The story felt a bit long at times, but made sense as you slowly started to see what the point of the movie was. Which was, how do we cope with growing out of a role that weve been so well known and loved for. How do you reinvent yourself when you leave your career? Something all of us face, classically described as the mid-life crisis.The ending of the movie was probably the best part for me. Although very violent, it was the characters redemption where they again find their new path out of the mid-life crisis.The flamethrower scene was epic and actually left me quite shocked. A hard scene to stay quiet for watching on a plane.Margot Robbie was in the movie less than I thought she'd be, and the hippie scenes left me quite uncomfortable. But overall once you get the idea of the movie, how the three characters relate to each other and what this time was all about the film becomes quite entertaining, and probably worth a second watch in a few years time.Still one of the best directors in my opinion.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
I only watched the whole thing because I had a cat on my lap,"Okay, so I'm probably the only person on the planet who's never watched a Quentin Tarantino film. I'm a 65 year old white lady who likes movie musicals. I'd heard so much good about this homage to TV and late 1960s; of course all the actors are generally great.I stayed with it for the sets and the clothes and the music and the cars. Very evocative of my childhood.However, as everyone has said - it's long, it's really long. There are so many scenes that could be trimmed or cut entirely; particularly movies being made within the movie that serve no real purpose. We get it, Leo's career is waning. He wasn't the guy used to be. Neither are we. Leo and Brad were great together, but I just kept wondering where the ""story"" was going. How are they going to tie this to the Tate - La Bianca murders? That's not the sort of topic that should be used as a hook for a movie.Also, for a movie with very little graphic violence for 2 hours, when it does happen it's way over the top. I gather that's what Tarantino fans expect. But again, asking your fans to watch over 2 hours of people driving around and cool old cars in LA waiting for their big brutal payoff makes it seem like a slasher flick.As a huge fan of pitbulls who worked in shelters for years and have seen more dead pitbulls than Tarantino can imagine, I can say this set their reputation back years.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

Many watchers of this film have commented how they stuck with it and were rewarded by the last quarter. That could lead you to conclude that it's the final scenes that evoke the uplifting feeling I mentioned, which would be quite reductive and perverse, wouldn't it?So it's about the beautiful friendship and how nice it is to see two people interact with each other in that unassuming, largely unspoken way.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

It's an interesting thought, if you're a teenager or in your 20s entertaining your fantasy. Not something you'd expect from a filmmaker pushing 60. Tarantino's humor is, unfortunately, still juvenile and he hasn't grown much since Kill Bill. Although I did chuckle here and there. Performances are great across the board and I wouldn't expect any less from such a cast.As for where it ranks? It's his best movie since the first Kill Bill.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Thoughts about Tarantino's 9th movie,"When you see lead cast members and the director, you can easily increase your expectations. If we look at the movie objectively without Di Caprio and Pitt's performances it would be very dull to watch this movie. Basically they saved the movie. They have very good chemistery in this movie and I hope they can work with each other in another project. The other performances was't remarkable but they are good like Margot robbie's Sharon tate.
I think all cinema lovers should watch the movie but casual action movie fans can find this movie boring.
Finally, This movie is not Tarantino's best work but it's not weakest too. If you don't have huge expectations or expect this movie to become masterpiece you can dissapoint.

ONCE UPON A TIME... IN THE MIND OF QUENTIN TARANTINO,"ONCE UPON A TIME... IN HOLLYWOOD B- (65)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a 2019 Comedy, Drama film, starring; Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, and Margot Robbie, directed by; Quentin Tarantino
'A faded television actor and his stunt double strive to achieve fame and success in the film industry during the final years of Hollywood's Golden Age in 1969 Los Angeles.'
Tarantino has always been a director that's at the top of most audience's favourite directors, so obviously a new film in his career will be on a lot of Most-Anticipated lists. At first I was a bit shocked at the initial reactions being very mixed. I prefer to ignore reactions prior to viewing the project in question and that's what I did with this film.
So, let's see how it is...
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
POSITIVES!
The fact that the film touches on and explores Hollywood and filmmaking is entertaining to selective audiences. As someone that enjoys the behind-the-scenes of filmmaking, this was enjoyable. This is perhaps the funniest Quentin Tarantino movie with plenty of laughs to be had by all. A lot of it was physical humour, and there were practical effects in those limited number of scenes that were vastly sturdy. A film with both Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt is seriously stimulating and the two-share strong chemistry together whilst being solid respectively. I'll admit that Brad Pitt was the more enjoyable side of the two with the comedy, physical, and other attributes. There's also a lot of other talent in the cast that will have audiences in a state of surprise. The cinematography is great, and the overall film looks gorgeous along with some entertaining editing. The costumes and other forms of makeup were all good restorations of the certain period being adapted. And there's a lot of music to tap along to.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
MIXED!
There is no denying that Quentin Tarantino has made some of the best films throughout his filmography, but this has the least Tarantino-esk atmosphere. This film had a very straightforward direction and what's so brilliant about Tarantino's vision is that it's always ahead of everyone else's. Although the recreation of the times and structures was fantastic and wonderful to observe, there seemed to be too much focus on those recreations rather than producing a significant story...
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEGATIVES!
The story? There were components to manufacture an entertaining narrative set in a ""Golden Age"" of Hollywood, but they never assembled. The film was more about glorifying Hollywood, which is something that Tarantino is fascinated by, but that doesn't mean that respective audiences would be as attracted. Sharon Tate's (Margot Robbie) appearance in the film and the way the character is written in the script is very empty. She's only in the film to allude to the tragic events that occurred in her life. And these elements really effect the enjoyment of the project. If you were expecting a clever and unique story then I apologise.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the end, Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood is an awfully varied project in my eyes, like most critics. Whilst I enjoy the performances, comedy elements, and just the period being adapted, Tarantino made a film for HIS enjoyment and not so much yours. I'm not persecuting the director, he's phenomenal, but this could be towards the bottom of my ranking for his career.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Shame,"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood isn't the movie you expect. It ponders and drags with unbearable self-indulgence, scene after scene of nonsensical interactions and feeling just out of place. I get it's suppose to be a hang-out type movie, but this is so not in the breath of that genre. It would've been much more intriguing as a melodramatic suspense story of some kind. Because as it stands, Tarantino thinks he's made gold, but in reality, Once doesn't really capture anything close to that measure.
I mean Pitt and DiCaprio have some moments of dynamic flare. But mostly it's forced and doesn't feel natural or authentic at all. I just can't picture this being apart of his filmography and accept its execution.
It poses some fascinating ideas but never really hits that high like pretty well every Quentin movie has done. For a 10 movie filmography, i feel as though he wasted one here.
And you might be wondering about the ending... well let's just say it takes all the splendor and glory the film sheds and shoves it down its own throat.

Best Tarantino Film So Far!,"I love mostly all of Tarantino's films, but Jackie Brown & Once Upon A Time in Hollywood are my favorites! I love these 2 films the most because they're different from all of the other Tarantino films. I'd put (Let's hope for a Volume 3) Kill Bill Volume 2 after Jackie Brown in my favorites. Pulp Fiction is great, but isn't my number 1 favorite. Django Unchained felt too long, Death Proof is okay. Inglourious Basterds is a masterpiece, and one of the greatest films last decade. Not every Tarantiono film is for everyone, including for fans. If you don't like his Jackie Brown kind of style of his films and more Kill Bill, you might be a bit dissapointed. This is my favorite Tarantino film because of it's rich storytelling, outstanding acting, smart dialogue, beautiful cinematography, and great soundtrack. I love the ending, and is my favorite Tarantino ending, and one of my favorite endings of all time. I loved every moment of this movie when I saw it, and was a breath of fresh air after the bad The Hateful Eight. If you like Tarantino's Jackie Brown style, you'll love this movie! My favorite movie of the year so far!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

It would be a crime drama not to see this one,"I don't know if Quintin set out to make this his masterpiece or not, but this is it. I can't praise enough the pairing of Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio, although I will admit that at first I wasn't sure. I did sit back and wonder for a bit, which I now see as a masterful stroke.Tarantino somehow managed to take LA back to a time which is long gone today, and I can't figure out how he did so. He filmed every subtle aspect of a town that only lives in memory today. You can't go to Los Angeles today expecting to see even a hint of 1960s LA hidden behind some new facade. It simply isn't there. But for three hours you can see what is no long there, thanks to Quintin and his crew.The story is as goofy as 1960s LA was. And it is delightful to see. This movie is just plain fun.I didn't quite catch on to Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio right way, then I let myself go and laughed hard at myself for expecting anything different. What excellent acting on each one's part! Superb! I gotta say, Brad was my favorite.This entire movie is a caricature created by Tarantino and performed by a slew of talent you won't grow tired of seeing sprung on you.

"8/10. Liked it. Quirky, different, well-acted, cool, and fun movie.","This is definitely a good movie. I just got done watching it and enjoyed it. There's not really much to say about the plot that hasn't already been understood by the publicity, but a few things stand out.DiCaprio gives a stellar performance as a Western aging actor on the downswing of his career, with many memorable acting scenes, some where he is acting within his acting.Pitt is also very good in his role as DiCaprio's stunt double. Robbie is excellent as Sharon Tate, and the other smaller roles are all played good enough.The movie takes its time in building up, and I've seen some people complain it was slow or boring, but I'll be honest: while I noticed a couple of scenes dragged a little bit, I rather enjoyed it, and it didn't bother me, for the most part.I liked some of Tarantino's creative choices and nuances a lot, but I did feel like there may have been a few opportunities missed to make it even better. However, with limited time and editing reasons, surely only so much could make it into the movie.I wouldn't mind seeing more of Cliff Booth and Rick Dalton's adventures through Hollywood in 1969. This one took the audience through Bruce Lee and the infiltration of the Hippies, but it seems like there could be even more to their stories.It's a solid film, and like one person pointed out: in an age of comic books and remakes, because the movie suffices on all levels, it was a nice experience to see something original.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

Once Upon A Time in Hollywood gut reaction:,"Once Upon A Time in Hollywood gut reaction:I really enjoyed it. A few things that I could see as potential negatives for general audiences: it has very slow pacing and is lacking a traditional plot structure, which tends to provide most films a compelling narrative. It is similar to his film Jackie Brown with its pacing. Also a bit on par with Pulp Fiction in terms of the storytelling approach/style. In essence, it takes its sweet time and doesn't have a straightforward plot. It's about two former Hollywood stars facing the reality of being washed up in the late 20th century. So, if you're a Tarantino fan, you'll enjoy the film regardless of the aforementioned ""negatives"", and perhaps, like me, will want even more runtime to enjoy. I absolutely gush and ultimately ""eat up"" the way QT shoots his scenes, writes his quirky dialogue, etc. I joyfully soak in every frame of his movies, no matter what. I'd see a film about landscapers mulching a house if he made it. To the shock of probably nobody, the ninth film by QT has great performances from the whole ensemble. Especially Leo. I'm still digesting that eight course meal of a film, but I really enjoyed it. Quentin Tarantino does a masterful job at delivering a comedic love letter to honor old Hollywood movies, especially the indie-western genre of old. Go see it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

Artfully done, I was thoroughly entertained the entire 2 hour and 40 minute run time but then again I know Tarantino films are a slow, delightful burn, which is why I have always been a fan.

Struggles of Mid-life Crisis and Good vs. Evil,"Actor Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and stunt man Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) are two best friends having a mid-life crisis in 1969 Hollywood. Dalton, who stars in a TV western series, ""Bounty Law,"" reflects on his life and believes he should have done better as an actor and should have been offered more challenging roles. Booth, once suspected of killing his wife, also believes he should have achieved more in life. Dalton is somewhat bitter, but both men exhibit an ability to care about the people around them. They also have a certain degree of decency and morals and the wisdom to recognize evil when they see it. This is especially true of the scene in which Booth visits the Spahn Ranch and recognizes the evil atmosphere perpetrated by the hippies who live there. After forcing one hippie to change his flat tire, Booth escapes certain death by driving away from the ranch just as Tex Watson, intent on killing any trespasser, returns on horseback from a tour of the ranch. For all that their own lives have been less than fulfilling, Dalton and Booth use their acting and action skills to become real-life heroes by defeating evil at the end of the film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

Leo and Brad Pitt are shoe-ins for Oscar noms, and the supporting cast was fabulous - each and every one of them. In fact, my husband and I are going to see it again next week (I've never seen the same film twice in the theatre), so that is indicative of just how much I enjoyed it.

Tarantino's best since Pulp Fiction,"First of all I'll just say, what a ride. The first viewing it really is a lot to take in, but the second viewing I knew what I was in for and it was even better paying attention to all of the little details. I'm 24 and actually had no idea about Sharon Tate (I had heard of her, I just didn't know what happened to her). So I feel this almost made the experience better for me the first time because I had very little expectations as to what may happen.I disagree with some people saying that younger generations won't enjoy it because it's set in the late 60's. Really, if you know the basics of what was going on at that time and are a Tarantino fan and/or a film lover, you should definitely enjoy this movie. Also, people saying it doesn't have a plot are missing the point. It's meant to be a fantasy and homage to that time period in and around Hollywood. It actually does have multiple plots, they are just hard to recognize because they are hidden behind many of Tarantino's little quirks. Essentially, it's about an actor hitting a speed bump in his career and not knowing what's next for him. And also his stunt double and confidant who inadvertently gets involved with the Manson ""family"". All while living next door to Sharon Tate.Really, everything is damn near perfect; namely the acting, writing and cinematography. The music, as always with Tarantino, was excellent. It is perhaps one of Tarantino's funniest movies too. Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt are both brilliant. I'm still having a difficult time deciding who was better. Probably Leo in terms of his intense acting, but Brad was as cool as ever and probably the more memorable character. Margot Robbie does an excellent job of portraying Sharon Tate and her innocence as well. Tarantino gets the very best out of all the supporting actors. Every single actor, whether in a minor role or not, definitely brought their A-game.Even if you feel like you wouldn't like the movie, I still think it's one that everyone should go and see anyway. If you don't like it, then that's fine. I just feel it brings you back to a time and place that we can all kind of relate to and appreciate in one way or another. Of course many people will be put off by its length and for being ""slow"" and self-indulgent. But for being the film it is, I feel those are almost positives because of the way Tarantino presents it. Definitely don't expect a bunch of action and violence like most of his films. The ending (which is amazing) and a few other moments aside, it's really one of his least violent movies. Also, it is maybe one his most mature films, perhaps right after Jackie Brown. Overall, it sort of has a little bit of all of his previous work bunched into it, which is probably another reason I loved it so much. It doesn't quite surpass ""Pulp Fiction"" for me, but it may just be the closest Tarantino gets to doing so.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

Worst Tarantino ever.,"He needed about two hours to do his usual bloodbath. And that two hours were the best of the movie. The more I watch of his movies, the more I get the impression that his writing lacks to the end. I got the impression, that he doesn't really know how to end a story without being violent. I guess this is his recipe. Tell something, show some feet in-between and then the bloody showdown. To watch his movies was much more nice at 'Pulp Fiction', it was much more nice at 'Kill Bill' and even at 'Inglourious Basterds', but does it ever have to be ""the same"" end? I'm bored by always seeing his brute force and violence fantasies in variations. He has no surprise in his movies, at the end it's always the same.

Inglourious Hollywood Basterds,"It's 1969 Hollywood. Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a former TV western star and Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) is his stunt double. Dalton's career is on a downward slide and Booth is also his driver. Dalton discovers that he is living next to famed director Roman Polanski and his actress wife Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie). Booth is taken with Pussycat (Margaret Qualley) who happens to be a Manson girl.There is only one section of true tension. It's Cliff Booth going to see George at the ranch. The ranch is the best section of the movie. Dalton and Booth have a fascinating chemistry. Brad Pitt may indeed be too pretty to be a stuntman. All of this leads me to conclude that it would be interesting to have Booth go back to the ranch to save George from the hippies. He can shoot them all and have a smoke. Quite frankly, the reworking of the climatic incident lacks the power of the Hitler cinema. I also don't like this Bruce Lee. It reminds me of all the copycat Bruce after his death and I doubt he would do a flying kick to start the fight. Obviously, Tarantino is reworking the legendary Bruce Lee incident but it feels wrong. Tex also feels wrong. There is a reason to rework Hitler for a revenge porn. There is no reason to rework Bruce Lee and if he's reworking the Manson family, he may as well rework it to its full extent. Quite frankly, Mindhunter gives an alternate version of Manson which is infinitely more compelling than this.

Best Third Act of any Tarantino film,"Going into this movie, audiences worldwide can come to an agreement that over the years, a sense of trust with Quentin Tarantino has been built, as he has never made a BAD movie, or even a 'meh' one.

The set design is brilliant, the acting is oscar-worthy, the dialogue is clever, the screenplay is unique, the list can go on.

Almost a deconstructed Tarantino made up of snapshot type scenes which when all put together told a story. You need to always go into his movies with an open mind and a 'what am I gonna get this time'. Pitt and Di Caprio are always incredible to watch and draw you in. I thought Margot Robbie was lovely but didn't have to do too much but be the Hollywood star. In the end, I thoroughly enjoyed it and found the end and interesting 'alternative'. So if you are open to typical quirky Tarantino you should enjoy this.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Neither Good Nor Bad Nor Ugly,"Patchwork is one word that comes to my mind when I try to describe this movie. There is, undoubtedly , a strong storyline that supports the sub plots , but one can clearly identify the seams.Just as the film tries to depict an era of transition in Hollywod, one can not miss a similar transition in Tarantino's directorial ventures. This transition was partially visible in Inglourious Basterds (2009) and pretty evident in Django Unchained ( 2012). The Hateful Eight (2015) could be called an exception, for despite the lukewarm reception it got from some quarters, it definitely is reminiscent of old school Tarantino. However , with Once Upon...Hollywood (OUH for short) Tarantino seems to have marched up to the precipice.There is abundant absurdism in the movie that is quite welcome. Tarantino also makes good use of most of his actors but they are undone at times by the patchy plots.It seems the whole film is grappling with irreconcilable elements, although each element in itself is fairly entertaining.The movie chugs along at a languid pace in the first half. The director succeeds in presenting an engaging picture of Hollywood and also treats the story itself respectably.The second half of the movie is only marginally quicker in progression than the first. But it is also the half where the movie falters a bit. On the one hand the turn of the plot is well arched and like any good story has a lot of implicit stimuli. On the other hand, the trajectory seems a bit wayward. The action sequences that appear are shot well and are gruesome ( as expected) and do balance the wheel.But there is always something that is missing in the narrative- is it the bite in dialogue? the sharpness in shifting between plots? Character development? Or the absence of substance in some scenes?May be it is just a phase that marks the completion of transition in Tarantino's film making.Whatever may be the case, the movie is a decent effort with some fairly
entertaining scenes. I wanted to give it 7.8 . Alas would have to give the movie an unfair 7.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Once upon a time ... in Tarantino's head.,"'Once Upon A Time ... In Hollywood (2019)' is disappointing. Frankly, it's just not very good. It not only lacks substance, it lacks style. The story meanders, the characters don't change, the plot-lines don't gel and the entire thing just feels like a bit of a wasted opportunity. It doesn't seem to be about anything, really. It's as if Tarantino decided to set a film in Hollywood in the 60s, then started writing and just didn't stop until he'd ran out of paper. Don't get me wrong, the filmmaking is on relatively fine form; the camera-work is assured, the cinematography is clean, the set-design and costuming are cohesive and the performances are all pretty much perfect. It's just the storytelling that's subpar. Rather than showing any real reverence for the period, the piece appears to despise it - or, at least, have no respect for it. I mean, you just have to look at the much-discussed Bruce Lee scene to see that (seriously, what's his problem with Bruce Lee?). This would be a strange stance for any cinephile to take, let alone perhaps pop-culture's most renowned cinephile, and it does make you wonder why Tarantino even bothered to dip into the cinematic history that he has so often aped. It's not even as if it's some sort of satire, which could have had the potential to work. Instead, it honestly comes across as fodder to feed an ego; most of the time, it's either like we're directly being given a history lesson or indirectly being told what would have happened if the writer-director was around back then. The alternate-history angle is perhaps the most intriguing thing about the entire enterprise, but it's mostly squandered on childish caricatures or tired machoism. In either case, it's inconsequential outside of enabling the two core characters to exist in a more-or-less recognisable 'real world'. The biggest changes don't hold any proper 'what if' weight because their aftermath is never explored and the characters they most keenly affect aren't really characters at all. This sadly includes Sharon Tate. It's bizarre that a story which apparently started with the intent of exploring and celebrating her very real life instead ended up focusing on two entirely made-up men. Tate gets no real agency and has a limited role, mainly serving to remind the audience of the odd fact/fiction dynamic and the looming Manson threat. While I'm on the subject and without spoiling anything, it's safe to say that the picture ends in quite a bit of bloodshed - if not in the way you expect. It's arguably Tarantino's most violent - or, I suppose, 'sadistic' - piece, mainly because of its apparent realism and accompanying brutality. The thing is that it's just so unnecessary and unnecessarily gratuitous, actually feeling unjustified in its near-glamorisation. There's this uncomfortable sense of 'revenge', I guess. I'm not one to squirm at on-screen violence, either - I haven't flinched at any of Tarantino's previous efforts, for example. The strange thing is that the flick also makes a point of getting involved with the age-old 'movie violence vs real violence' debate, depicting its 'real violence' as much more disturbing than its 'movie violence' but also going out of its way to have a few characters name 'movie violence' as the inspiration for their attempts at 'real violence'. The messaging is mixed, to say the least, and will do the filmmaker no favours when it comes to journalists poking at his stance on the matter. At least, I suppose, there's an awareness of theme in this aspect, however unhelpful its conclusion may be. The rest of the picture doesn't seem to have any semblance of this, settling instead for a scene-by-scene sort of thing that never really comes together. In a way, there's a plot but there's not a narrative (loosely speaking). Some of it is quite entertaining, to be fair. It's not exactly boring but it's not exactly engaging, either. The best stuff involves Dalton shooting a guest-spot on a western TV show; these scenes are fairly enjoyable, bring out the best in DiCaprio and feature a 'film within a film' that's probably more fun than the film itself. The sequences with Booth just feel like an extended B-plot, with no real drive behind them. The feature eventually gives up and skips forward a huge chunk of time, opting to use narrated exposition to fill in the gap and then over-explain a faster-paced final third. Interestingly, the stuff that is skipped appears as if it could have made for a more-than-decent story that actively changes the core characters. The final movement moves faster but it isn't any more compelling. Plus, by the time you get there, you've not got the energy to care. Overall, the picture is unfocused and unimpressive. It has its merits, of course, and the performances really are top-notch. However, it's not particularly entertaining and it's actually rather predictable. It's quite problematic, too; it has an undercurrent of unpunished, hero-perpetrated violence against women, for example. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

"Not a ""feel-good"", but the movie makes you FEEL good","4 years. That's how long we had to wait for Tarantino to return to the big screen. Now that's an awful long time, but as the saying goes: good things happen to those who wait - this movie does not dissapoint.Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is Tarantino's homage to the cinematic world and to, of course, Hollywood as it was back in its golden days - and what a stunningly good looking film it is. You can't help but admire the broad colour palette, the beautiful cars, old school billboards and the gorgeous neon lightning of the many cinemas, which together manages to create a more than believable 1960's Hollywood. An almost glorified version perhaps - in a good way - like a piece of candy you just want to reach out and grab. While mentioning the beauty of this film, one cannot forget to also mention the soundtrack, that is as close to ear-sex as you can come. I myself have listened to ""Bring a Little Lovin'"" on repeat since i left the theatre.The movie circles around the outdated actor Rick Dalton (Leo DiCaprio) and his stuntman Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), as well as following Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) on her daily adventures. The main story at hand is the one of Rick and Cliff, but for those well informed knows that the year of 69' was a special one, in a sort of way, for Hollywood. Without saying too much, it involves Sharon Tate and Charles Manson. While being the background story, and the one inspired by true events, it fits really well with Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth's story. And Tarantino being Tarantino, you better believe that he ""Tarantino-fies"" the whole situation.At the same time as Tarantino is being Tarantino, it is also a very different movie than what we're used to seeing. It touches on the brink of comedy, but not the silly comedy that were used to in films such as The Naked Gun or Mr.Bean no, this is Tarantino comedy. And my god he handles it well. The whole movie is a beautiful roller coaster, with not a lot of steep ups and downs, but with mature humour that is sure to make an audience have a great movie experience. As to give an example: seeing Brad Pitt play a minacious stunt driver, with a sketchy past, getting high and having a gun pointed at him is hilariously funny, and it's also one of the best scenes in the movie.Do you need to mention the acting? When you have names as Margot, Brad, Leo and even Al Pacino himself you expect stellar performances - and that is what we got, plain and simple. Leo gives his best ever performance, Brad is scary good as a mysterious stunt driver, Margot is absolutely wonderful as the joyful Sharon Tate, and Al pacino, well, Al Pacino is Al Pacino.Tarantino said this is the closest he's ever gotten to recreate Pulp Fiction. He also said that he put it all into this film, and you really can feel it. To experience Tarantino at this level is truly breathtaking. With the natural talent found within him and all the experience he's gotten from his past of remarkable films, he brings it all out on this one - and it pays off. You can feel Tarantino's breaths (Not literary, that would be somewhat disturbing) sitting opposite the movie screen. You can feel his heartbeat (Not literary either) pulsating throughout the film. All of his passion and love for cinema is felt right through the screen and it touches your feelings. It makes you feel good.Sad as it is, Tarantino has stated he will only make 10 movies - which I respect. After Once Upon a Time in Hollywood's release, he has stated he might retire before his 10th. How sad it is, this film feels like the perfect end note for him. I wouldn't say he is at his peak, because he has peeked ever since Reservoir Dogs, but with this film he has truly proved himself as a master of cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Entertainingly self-indulgent,"It's easy to see why Tarantino's film has been such a hit with film critics and film buffs. It's an ode to the movies. It weaves a story around showbiz icons and showbiz trivia. It is crammed with cute cameos. And it revolves around masterly performances by a couple of genuine screen legends. There's also something undeniably mesmerising about the era and the events around the Manson murders in LA. And the film positively oozes with Tarantino's enthusiasm for vintage 1960s Hollywood, and for all manner of sub-genres, from westerns to cheesy television to martial arts. But can we at least acknowledge that, for all the intoxicating nostalgia and quirky revisionist history, Tarantino doesn't really deliver much in the way of narrative drive. The film ambles along like a cowboy with three-day blisters. It shifts between scenarios that are almost devoid of dramatic tension (Sharon goes to the movies; Cliff fixes an antenna). And if it wasn't for Charles Manson and his crazies hovering over the proceedings there would be precious little in the way of suspense or dramatic tension through much of the movie. To that extent, Once Upon A Time is often a bit like a trip to a museum. It's often diverting. Occasionally fascinating. And you glimpse various different stories along the way. But it falls some way short of being a gripping, wholly engaging ride.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

The Hills Are Alive With the Sounds of Quentin - Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,"This is the best film Quinton Tarrantino and Leonardo DiCaprio have ever done. It is also the best work that Brad Pitt has ever done. That being said, Tarrantino has never really made a legitimate film; but this is the closest he has come. He is getting better. It is a good period piece. DiCaprio can never be a macho actor even though he has tried a dozen times to do so. Even Marty couldnt convince the audience he was a gang leader in old New York. Lewis, yes, Decaprio? Please. He is more like that great funny guy who doesnt know where to find the hole for his motorcycle.. Pitt, on the other hand, has no problem handling the macho role. To his credit, DiCaprio does have a few good scenes (his missing lines rage and his bad guy satire); however, he gets bogged down in his other scenes. Pitt is consistently good in every scene he is in and will win the Academy Award this year for Best Supporting Actor. Amusingly enough, because the Academy outrageously omitted Adam Sandler for Uncut Gems from the nominations, Pitt could have won Best Actor in the category had he been nominated. But now that award will probably go to Phoenix for Joker. A wise decision to have him nominated for Best Supporting Actor. This film will not win Best Movie of the Year; that honor will go to 1917, which is already a classic. Best Director and Cinematography will also go to 1917. The only other possible winner might be Parasite, but not this amusing film. Tarrantino is getting better though.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

Average Tarantino film; still worth a one time watch,"I'm not the biggest Tarantino fan, but I respect his style and love of filmmaking. It's not for me, but he's definitely left a unique calling in the timeline of film. Going into this, I knew exactly what to expect - an enticing setup, a slow middle-act build, and an extreme climax. That's exactly what I got.If you know his work, this will be enough film to digest. It's definitely not his best, but I'm happy to see films that don't stick to conformations of established story-telling. Everything you want is there- long drawn out scenes, biblical quotes, extreme violence and awkward comedy. And that's pretty much all I can say.Brad Pitt is the clear stand out, and Margot Robbie has no role (don't expect much from her plot). Leo also does a stellar. And that's the point- there's really not much to go on about. This film depicts a collection of events that took place in 60's Hollywood, that may or may not contribute to an overall story arc. Everyone does their jobs pretty well.Fans of Tarantino will find moments to enjoy,but I must emphasize the following :
If you're not aware of his film style, and if you're a casual movie goer who needs compelling plot and action driven moments, please skip this movie. There is nothing here for you.

Utterly mixed,"The good - The performances from the leads are fantastic. Human, relatable- Tarantino draws something special out of two, admittedly vastly experienced and accomplished, actors.
The bad - the Bruce Lee scene seems unnecessary and a cheap way to build another characters aura.
Most disturbing though was the other creative licence taken with history. I had mixed feelings about it in inglorious bast*rds, but for this, when less people will know what really happened, again I'd just question how necessary it was. The suspense scenes would still have worked just as well without trading on it.

I would rate this the lowest of all Tarantino films,"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019) is a movie my wife and I saw in theatres as soon as it came out. The storyline follows a former Hollywood star whose star has begun to dim. As his career begins to die so does the career of his stunt man. As they deal with their spiraling careers the rise of the Manson family is about to hit Hollywood.This movie is directed by Quentin Tarantino (Django) and stars Leonardo DiCaprio (The Departed), Brad Pitt (Fight Club), Margot Robbie (Suicide Squad), Timothy Olyphant (The Crazies), Dakota Fanning (The Alienist), Al Pacino (Scarface) and Bruce Dern (The Hateful Eight).The characters are perfectly written, cast and delivered. The script is out of this world and this movie had a ton of potential. There were several worlds colliding in this picture during this time period that was fascinating. However, the conclusion of this film tried to be too much like Inglorious Bastards and have its own Tarantino spin on history that didn't work as well in this picture...it actually kind of ruined it for me. If they showed what really happened I think this would have been a far better film.Overall this is a very smart, well written movie that runs a bit longer than it needed to and has a mediocre to bad ending.

Once Upon a Time in... Hollywood,"In theory, this ought to have been excellent. Di Caprio and Pitt together with Tarantino and a sprinkling of Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie). Well, eventually - after maybe 2 hours, or so, we get something akin to what I was expecting. The long, ponderous road to this conclusion has been described by some as a sort of ""love story"". Hmmm, I think they are being kind. There is a bond between the two gents but it isn't really worthy of comment. I don't see how it significantly differs from the bond any partnership might form after many years of working together. Boo hoo, ""Dalton"" (Di Caprio) is a bit of an alcoholic who has become typecast and doesn't get the parts he used to. Well how many other actors have ended up in the same boat? ""Booth"" Pitt's character has very little to get his teeth into; except perhaps at the end and if you do expect anything substantial from Sharon Tate, then think again.

"Boring, boring, boring. Self-complacent ramblings about nothing","To say that this movie is self-complacent would be a gigantic understatement. As gigantic maybe as Tarantino's memory, overloaded with scores of details that he doesn't care to sort out. So he unloads them in bulk. The result : it's like you go to a promising party but end up cornered most of the night by some drunk guy who absolutely wants to share his opinions about everything.Right from the start you get vignette after vignette, self-indulgent, overlong spoof sequences that bog down the main narrative. What with all the stuff Tarantino has learnt about movies he can't shorten exposition to clever ellipses ? Once upon a time I thought he was very good with dialogue, but I guess it is no fun to toil and write fine lines (no just snappy one-liners from time to time) when Sony will greenlight anything you want to shoot.Once upon a time in Hollywood does not have a plot. It is the New Wave auteur in Tarantino who does not think he needs a plot. He has a couple of characters, a dozen anecdotes and the rest is talent. Self-conscious talent, lazy talent, talent isolated in the middle of a creative process. More like naked skills, each trying separately to express its full potential.The hero and his sidekick are losers: how do you build a story around losers ? You need rhythm and some kind of McGuffin (wasn't it all there in Pulp Fiction?), not some vague exploration of the meaning of life. The plot is limited to the draft premise: a has-been TV actor and his stunt double cope with reality in Hollywood around the time of the Manson Family murders.
The backdrop of the murders is the only narrative asset. We are teased all along, we even have an extensive reconstitution of life at the Spahn Ranch... all this just to toy around and end with the kind of ultra-violent carnival that Tarantino fans seem to revere.
Clearly the challenge of mentioning the sordid Tate-LaBianca murders of August 1969 was not only above Tarantino's mental ability, but grossly using background anecdotes from it as fodder for his inspiration was within his moral scope.As always I am judging this movie on its merits from a movie enthusiast point of view. But Tarantino is much more than a movie enthusiast. He is a guttonous movie fanatic. He is a guru with followers who let themselves be impressed, just like with Charles Manson. Many more followers than Charles Manson; fortunately Tarantino followers are only trained to see the fun in violence.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

This Movie is Almost 3 Hours!?,"There is no better compliment for a long movie than to not realize it is a long movie. It means that the movie is engaging enough to keep you invested for the entire run time. This is definitely one of those movies. Set prior to the Manson Family murders, Tarantino's new film follows a pretty boy actor whose career is coming to an end and his gopher stunt double and friend. Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) is trying to turn his dying career around, looking for one more breakthrough role, but its just not happening. Like many of the young pretty boy actors of classical Hollywood, he is just not transitioning to the new age of 60s Hollywood. Meanwhile, his only friend during this troubled period, Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), is contentedly coasting through life. He has no qualms as long as he gets to work for his friend, but his carefree lifestyle runs him afoul of the notorious Manson Family. And then Tarantino happens.Tarantino knows how to design a world. In his own version of the 1960s, he crafts something that's wonderfully familiar and yet something all his own. His committment to the setting is phenomenal, bringing up even the smallest details that most wouldn't know. For instance, Italian movies of the time often would bring in actors from around the world and had them deliver their lines in their native languages, later redubbing them in post. There are even scenes where nothing is going on, and he just wants to show off his handiwork. Yet they don't drag the movie for an instant.In spite of the directors reputation, there is little violence in this movie. Two and a half hours of this movie has only occasional instances but the vast majority of it is dedicated to the drama of Dalton's floundering career. And none of it drags. DiCaprio and Pitt are charming and funny and the number of familiar faces that pop up is a stark reminder of talent seemingly forgotten in the modern age. But the gloves have to come off eventually, and Tarantino pulls no punches. That last ten minutes is brutal as only the most violent man in Hollywood could make it.This movie is a blast.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

"In a world where movies are made for everyone, QT does what he does best, and makes a masterpiece not everyone will appreciate.","I have now seen this movie three times in theatres... and by god I may indulge again tomorrow night.
That to me is the very description of the crafted, honed, and mastered skill that QT has.First off let me say that this IS NOT a movie everyone will appreciate.
I was reminded by this as I seen this the first time with a ""less appreciative"" relative of mine, then upon leaving the theatre he glanced at the poster next door and mumbled ""shoulda seen Hobbs and Shaw"". *I gasp*This movie shatters everything that makes the films that pour into the cinema. I truly believe it's QT spitting on what ""should"" be. ""Oh you think this scene feels uncomfortable? Well here! Oh this doesn't ring true to the real events? Who said it should?! Oh you're getting bored? WELL FLAMETHROWER.
It's NOT story driven (you ask me to tell you what the movie is about and I'm hard pressed to get that into one sentence), it's NOT making you feel stupid by finding ways to introduce characters and situations, every shot DOES NOT have a purpose, every scene DOES NOT lead to further the plot. ...And I love it. (More about that below)This movie to me is simply about life.
It does what movies I believe are forgetting they should do, it transports you to another time, another era, and by the last act, another reality.
I can't believe after seeing the trailer I expected (well... with a QT movie I can't believe I foolishly set my expectations anywhere) a noir thriller about the Manson murders. When walking out of the theatre I realized Charles Manson has LITERALLY one scene!
This isn't a ""wooooow that was so cool when that happened"" type movie, it's a journey through relatively regular lives of a couple of people in an incredible era.
It's filled with subtle questions about the social construct we live in, fame, the duality of man, and yet still rings true to the QT movies of the past pulling out a scene that makes you sit up in your seat and go ""...what the living f+%# was that"".Onto the movie itself, it has terrific performances all around. Brad Pitt at the best I believe I've seen him in a long time, Leo does what Leo does he's a great actor. Robbie pulls off a Sharron Tate so ditsy, yet at the same time so kind hearted. Although I believe the REAL star of the show was a 12 *achem* I mean 8 year old girl who stole EVERY SECOND of the few scenes she was in.The dialogue? Crisp. Not the best we've seen from QT, but MORE then enough to remind why he's one of the very best. This isn't a short film, and it doesn't speed along to say the least, but with dialogue like this who needs it to?? I found myself wanting scenes to continue just to hear more back and forth, more witty comments, more punch lines that hang in the air as the conversation moves on.That all paired with BEAUTIFUL shots of the city that brought us anything playing in the local theatre, and a soundtrack. OHHH the soundtrack. From a driving at night shot of Brad Pitts ""Ramblin Gamblin Man""(Bob Segar) to the ominous ""Out of Time"" wails of the Rolling Stones as Sharron Tate heads home for that fateful evening. If you're not into the vibe of the city the music will get you there quick.A film I truly am proud to say I witnessed released, and will indeed quench the thirst for a Tarantino movie till the 10th and final, and for years to come after.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

This movie like Pulp Fiction, is not about the plot. Pulp Fiction has no plot as well. Once upon a time in Hollywood is about the characters and about situations. You need to have some culture in movies to like this one. Of course is too long for if you started to watch movies after 2005. It s obvious that you never seen the old classic movies. Then you wondering why cinema has changed and we dont have good movies anymore. Because of you guys, new generation, with no patience, fans of CGi, Fast and Furious, etc. Cinema will never be the same because of nowdays audience without culture in movie. Thank you Tarantino for this amazing movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Tarantino,"Movie scriptwriters, directors, producers and actors take note, master story teller and film maker is showing the world how legendary films are meant to be made and enjoyed!

Pretty good,"First off this is definetly a decent effort from Tarintino. His movies seem to switch from brilliant to boring, while all having his similar traits. This one being a mixture of both.It gets points for being original (something we're all craving these days) having an excellent cast and plenty of style. There are some amazing scenes but others are going to go straight over people's heads.Ye need to know about 60's Hollywood and the Manson family before walking into this one. You will definetly get something out of it if you do. But for all its strengths it is very drawn out and a bit anticlimactic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
AMAZING - Not self indulgent - ignore that idea,I saw the first showing on day of release (tradition) and yes I saw Jackie Brown on Christmas Day. I am a fan but can call a spade a spade.... if a movie sucks I'll admit it. This film is incredible. Actors under the direction of QT are just incredible. QT can turn big movie stars in his films into real people.... this in itself is a major accomplishment. I would assume this comes from total trust in your director.From start to finish this move fleshes out who these people are and it's a pleasure to watch. People Love to say QT is self indulgent - I believe his love for film transcends that idea and he's actually just giving us the best movie he can. I have not stopped thinking about this film since Friday. His films get better with each viewing and this one will surely be included.We just don't get films made with this degree of skill everyday. QT is def in the league of the LegendsAll I can say this movie won't be fully appreciated til some point in the future. Not going to babble on. This film is AMAZING.,10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
A mishmash of nothing,"I kept hoping as i watched this for a turn around at some point, but at the 2 hour point i got tired of waiting, and stopped it on my dvd. It was obvious a love affair of QT'S NOSTOLGIC love of the late 50's amd 60's. So was I, up to a point...but i couldn't take it anymore. I was waiting to see why Brad Pitt won an oscar for his role. i was waiting and there was absolutely nothing shown by his acting that deserved the award. He was just Brad Pitt. You knew towards the middle that Manson and Sharon Tate was going to be the 'thing' about this movie. I feel that the remaining supported nominated actors were cheated.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
What was that even about?,That was just strange. Basically no story here. Movie really didn't go anywhere. Couple cool scenes but ya kind of a pointless film. Wasn't a bad movie but I wouldn't suggest it.,6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Possibly the best acting I've ever seen in a film,"I kid you not the acting in this film was incredible. Brad Pitt being the standout star for me personally he sells his character so well I almost forgot that it was Brad Pitt I was watching. DiCaprio does just as well of course. It shows a films quality when you have two amazing actors, you could argue some of the best ever, each actor has so many amazing films yet this one still can compete with those amazing titles. The movie does definitely feel like an almost three hour movie but that dident bother me enough to drop it to a nine. the atmosphere of the movie is also spot on making you feel like your in the 60s again. The climax of the film is so funny and Tarantino like (fans of his work will know what I mean) Overall this film might be Quintin Tarantino best masterpiece. And that means a lot when Tarantino has so many top of the industry films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

Brilliant with a twist of sick...ala Tarantino!,"I'm rating this a ""10"" mainly due to the incredible acting of Leo DiCaprio! This man is phenomenal in everything he does. And Brad Pitt complimented him & was as well brilliant. The violence is a bit much, but is to be expected in a Tarantino film...so why was I laughing?!

Music was perfect. Leo should win every award for his superb acting. Bravo!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Disappointing,"A very disjointed storyline with dialogue that is subpar for Tarantino standards. There are characters and scenes that are entirely superfluous. The main characters are rich with personality, but their personality is barely at any substantive use throughout the film. The whole film feels like a very large build up towards a very short and disappointing ending. Needlessly to say the film is still entertaining and worth a watch, but definitely not his best. I'm a huge Tarantino fan, but the quality of this film is nowhere near the quality of Inglorious Basterds or Django Unchained, unfortunately.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
"The best Tarantino movie, with a symbolic and powerful ending.","It has to be one of the most gorgeous, cinematic and powerful movies I've ever seen.It's of paramount importance that you know the history of Sharon Tate, what happens to her, and the Manson family.The ending is incredible, symbolic and sad.

What are these people smoking?,Yes Leo and Brad give great performances but it feels like a long drive where the kids keep asking : are we there yet?

Unfortunately this is not a movie for everyone,"To understant this movie you need to have a culture in films. In this times, this movie is not for everyone, not even for all QT fans. Pulp fiction has no plot, Reservoir dogs has no plot at all, Once upon a time as well, these movies are about characters, about situations, not about the plot. Thanks god cuz Pulp fiction was made in another era, otherwise it would have been reviewed by nowdays fans, CGI, Fast and Furious fans, and a lot of kids with no culture in movies and would be a mess. You dont understand nothing from Pulp Fiction, you like this movie just because you know that is cool to like Pulp fiction, but actually you don't understant nothing from it. This movie is a masterpice, absolutely amazing. If you complain that this movie is too long, you dont understant nothing from QT movies. You cant go at this movie with your girlfriend who is a disney fan and to expect to like it. This movie is for another level of audience. Cinema has been changed and will never be the same because of this new generation, with no culture, no passion, no patience and cgi fans, disney, superhero movies etc. Soon cinema will die.

"Amazing Cast, great cinematography","I loved the chemistry of Pitt & DiCaprio. Here we have an entire cast of superstars. There is no clear story line it's all about amazing acting skills. I loved every bit of DiCaprio's acting. I also expected good acting of Pitt, cause when you think about Fight Club or Babel you do know he has some great roles. As soon as I knew the Charles Manson Story is involved in this movie I was excited how Tarantino brings that in this movie. To keep my review a little bit short. All I can say is that you should go to this movie if you like to see some great acting and have a Faible for that 60s Retro shot. In some parts of the movie it felt like it's getting stretched, but it's covered by the acting skills of DiCaprio & Pitt.The only negative point that really made me furious was how they showed up Bruce Lee as an arrogant and overconfident man. Real fans of Lee do know he was never that person in the movie. It's a disgraceful treatment against his legacy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Possibly the best Tarantino so far,"The script is perfect. It cleverly uses the unpleasant threat of the Manson family, the overall strange and mystic feeling of L.A. living in their cars, and the three main characters: one describing the fear and anxiety we all have, one presenting the idealized and brave masculinity we wish to have, and one presenting the love for the art and the beauty of old Hollywood.LDC, Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie all do a wonderful job, but Brad Pitt's performance is perfect. There are few scenes that are visually so perfect and intense that you will remember them for years.I went to the cinema with my teenage children and their friends. Some of them were totally confused and bored, and I cannot blame them: the movie is complex, clever and based on the knowledge of Hollywood history, that it was totally beyond their understanding.Most reviews explain that the main theme of the film is friendship which naturally is true. The deeper theme is the love for the film as an art form and the anxious pain of artists seeking acceptance. The film shows this in a visually amazing way, with a perfect rhythm and a perfect cast.For me, this was pure art. It answered questions that I did not know I had until the movie answered them. And one additional note; this is a perfect movie to explain the concept of Chekhov's gun for those young movie goers who were not familiar with the concept before.The film community has warmly accepted Tarantino which is presented in a beautiful way in the end.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

My Review from Cannes,"Once a Time in Hollywood, the new film from contemporary trend setter Quentin Tarantino is a masterful and lushly directed spectacle that may well be his best film since Pulp Fiction.The film tells the tale of Rick (Leonardo DiCaprio) an actor that currently appears in a TV show called Bounty Law, but his career is begging to decline, so his agent (Al Pacino) advises him to take a role in a Spaghetti Western. Meanwhile his stunt double, best friend and driver (Brad Pitt) spends much of the movie palling up to Rick and giving him advice. The pair live next to Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate and the story eventually leads to various joint storylines, romance, drama, action, Charles Mansion and a finale to rival the audacity and awe of Inglorious Basterds.OUATIH is a beautifully photographed movie with exquisite and enchanting cinematography including a four-minute long stedi-cam shot that may just be an Oscar worthy moment of photographic exuberance. Tarrantino's script is Tarantino-esque and continues his theme of running retro significant references to the late sixties, witty dialogue, pop-culture, smart one-liners and complex movie references. Tarrantino however needs a new editor as some scenes are overlong and too sharply cut. This doesn't ruin the movie but it looks poor and does lessen it.As for the performances, I can tell you now that there will be certainly Oscar nods for Pitt and DiCaprio and the later's performance is in fact so good that it may we'll be his best so far in his career. Scorsese's insistence of working with DiCaprio ruined some of his movies that would have been better with another performer but this was only a benefit for Leo who has impressively grown as an actor. Here as Rick he brings the confidence of his turn in Wolf of Wall Street and the stature of his Shutter Island portrayal. Pitt, who is ageing well, gives a performance that is scene stealing. In OUATIH, it's almost like he is unaware of the camera and he has a natural rapport with it and never seems aware that he's playing a character. There are some other good turns including a incredibly impressive Bruce Lee take off by Mick Moh.OUATIH is one of the best (but not the best) film of 2019 and will be long remembered by Tarrantino fans.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

Tarantino is a Film Genius,"I just saw this film and was blown away! This story is a sharply directed and written cross between a love letter to the late 60's in Hollywood and a buddy film. The cinematography is gorgeous and all of the colors are incredible to look at. The non-linear storytelling and narration we all know Tarantino does best is at the top of his game. I absolutely loved the scenes that were Rick Dalton (DiCaprio) acting in the movies he stars in. They were extremely intense or hilariously funny but so enjoyable. That being said, what really puts this movie ahead more than any other is the performances from DiCaprio and Pitt. They are both hilarious and then in the next scene they are making you tear up or feel their emotions at a whole new level. DiCaprio has to be an actor playing an actor who occasionally is playing a role in tv shows or movies which is extremely difficult and he blows it out of the water. Pitt plays a mysterious and hilarious stunt man who is cocky but deep down he will always be Rick's friend. Alright academy awards let's bring home the bacon with this incredible piece of film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Tarantinos Most Unique Film,"I really enjoyed seeing this last night. It was definitely Tarantino's most experimental movie, as his strengths shined at creating a hyper realistic depiction of Hollywood during the late 1960's. DiCaprio and Pitt had great chemistry together, and the comedy was very strong at certain parts. Of course, DiCaprio and Pitt do an incredible job in this movie as always. They play very well off of eachother, as their characters are unique in their own ways. As well, Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate added a great touch to the historical backdrop of the film. There does not seem to be just one central plot, so the movie really just feels like a collection of relevant scenes. Movies like these feel more like an experience than just an average blockbuster. That is why I will be revisiting this movie multiple times. If you can appreciate good production, acting, and possibly one of Tarantino's most suprising endings, then it is definitely worth your time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

Once upon a time .. there was fictional revenge,"I'm usually sure Tarantino would make a movie so solid and atmospheric that is would convince me to like it by time if not right the first time I watch it. Once upon a time did convince pretty much by the first time.There is a standard Tarantino movie in our heads, like there is a standard Woody Allen in our head and if a director breaks with our expectations we're either disappointed that he/she did not fulfill them/doesn't work well or we're blown away. Once upon on time ... in Hollywood is one of those movies that didn't even try to be a typical Tarantino: less violence and people dying all over the movie, filmed like an homage to a certain time and making of a movie, ""meaningless"" scenes etc.
First I experienced the feeling of disappointment but there came a point where the movie told me what's its actually about and I felt like "" Ok you got me Tarantino"". The whole concept worked for itself although it's not the typical Tarantino storytelling. The atmosphere is outstanding as the actors are and of course you feel the Tarantino handwriting in it. In this movie you have to be able to enjoy some longer scenes that are not made to transport a certain part of the story by being a clever inserted piece of puzzle. Some scenes are just made for giving the movie atmosphere and shaping characters more than necessary like Tarantino fell in love with them. The movie could without a doubt be shorter still make the same sense without those long scenes. I'm not sure if I would have liked that too much though. I really loved that Tarantino didn't even try to be the Tarantino of the past, that he changes, giving the movie what is new on his mind. I'm sure expects of his fans to be progressive in watching his movies and not conservative.The only reason why I'm not giving 10/10 is the motif of revenge which he uses in too much of his movies and does it in this one either. That made me think about why he just can't find another reason to make a movie. Of course you can say ""Why should he if it works perfectly fine?"" but this would make him appear a little more colorful and a bit less restricted. But to be fair it is the best movie of 2019 I watched so far and one of his best works at all. I loved it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

A weird ride.,"This was my first Tarantino feature in a theater, and I was hugely excited because of that. I find it impossible to rank his films because I love all of them so much, especially Pulp Fiction and Django Unchained. I had some expectations from a QT movie.What followed next was the most self-indulgent QT has ever been in his career. It's literally a movie about a normal day in a struggling actor's career, with a stunt double and a stunning actress as a next-door neighbor. Lots of 60s kitsch that helped make the movie, dialogue that'll make you laugh riotedly, and good performances all round.However, it felt underwhelming. Maybe it's possible because of the marketing or what, but I didn't feel that same thrill I felt in most of his other movies. I like the subtle referential style he adopts in this movie, where he references his own filmography, or that of the old times. But, it feels too slow. Too much driving, for one.However, I still give it a high rating because of how entertaining it proves to be. The final 30 minutes are full-blown Tarantino that we deserved. One could say it was worth the build-up, and it is a happy ending. There's some great, memorable scenes as well, most notably the one between Bruce Lee and Cliff Booth who's Brad Pitt's character. It also has everything else essential to a QT movie - killer (very killer, indeed) soundtrack, snappy dialogue, faithfulness to the period.It's not QT's best, but it is his most experimental and self-indulgent. It's also a weirdly enjoyable ride, and doesn't feel boring for too long. It's not an instant classic, but it's a ride you should sign up for.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Exhausting...,Sitting through a film (I'm English) for that amount of time for 10 minutes action that has a tenuous link to a non existent plot was hard work.How has this got a review rating of 8.0 when the overall consensus is its a pile of do do is beyond me!,1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
The Tarantino effect..,"This movie let you exit from the theater with an exited enthousiastic mood lasting many days... like an euphoric drug.
Any spectator can't help after seeing it wanting to create or be part of a project like this one!Quentin build with maniacal precision an entire legendary world and realised for an other time the miracle to transmit with positive contagion his love for cinema.Full of evocative music, stories nested into the story and small situations and characters that let you wonder about human condition..
Lots of movies world references magically inserted by the maestro give real joy to experts.Some said that there could be lack of a plot but the similarity with Fellini's La Dolce Vita kind of storytelling structure is obvious. Moreover the suspense is growing during all the movie, like today only Tarantino is able to do..
No need to have a plot when he is playing with your mind and anything can happen at anytime... and you know it..
Thank you Quentin!

Once Upon a Time in...Boringland,"If I were to have viewed this film prior to having any knowledge regarding it, I never would have guessed it to be Tarantino's work. The plot and much of the character dialogues did not resemble his work whatsoever.For the first two hours, it felt like Tarantino was trying to build tension between characters that were underdeveloped. I was almost certain that this would result in something, and that the end of the film would prove the lack of the main characters' development to be significant.When the film got to the third act it seemed as if Tarantino realized he had burned through two out of the three hours he had, as things sped up oddly fast. The ending was good and by far the most exciting part of the film, but it felt incomplete. I left the theater feeling confused and as if I missed something.The film does have its highs, set design is insane and very pleasing, and the acting is super good too. Leo's performance was one of the best ever. Camera work as always is good. With all of these factors in place, it feels as if Tarantino had the opportunity to turn this film into the best of his whole career, but forgot to add the elements that make his other films so successful.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Meh,"Good cast some classic Tarantino at the finish, but took too long to get to the point. About 2 hours in, I went to the restroom and thought ""when is this going to end?""",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
If it wasn't Tarantino,"Tarantino is like modern art or freeform jazz, we say we like it because we're afraid to be thought 'uncool' if we don't. Had this movie been directed by John Smith it would have hardly been noticed but because QT can get A-listers and has a name it gets him a pass on what is a much too long, much too meandering movie. This story could have been told in 90 minutes instead of the 160 it took. Brad Pitt does a terrific job, Margot Robbie is perfect and even though strained, Leonardo DiCaprio is very good. The problem is that Tarantino wanders away from what was a great idea into some self indulgent fantasy land. There is a great story in this movie, unfortunately it is being told like your stuttering uncle trying to tell a long joke.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Another great Tarantino flick,"First of all, I could not believe the movie was over when the credits came up. A 2 1/2 hour movie that seemed much, much shorter. Leo was good but Pitt was great. They play off each other wonderfully. Every scene with Pitt was gold. One of the few movies my wife has watched with me and she loved it. It was just a beautifully crafted movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
A love letter to the silver screen,"Most of, no All of the focus of this movie is on old classic Hollywood, its a love letter, an homage to the 50's silver Screen. Its interesting but there isn't really much of a plot here in terms of a movie. We follow Leonardo DiCaprio as screen actor Rick Dalton and his stunt double turned best friend Cliff Booth/Brad Pitt -both are flawless in their roles- as they struggle to keep pace with the swiftly evolving entertainment industry.While working to continue their notoriety they face the demise of the golden age and also the Manson family which is about the only part of this that feels Tarantino-esque as he again rewrites history and BBQs a couple of people in the pool. The cast of familiar faces taking on bit parts in this movie is a veritable whos-who. I particularly enjoyed seeing Sharon Tate, Bruce Lee, Steve McQueen. Bottom line It's good.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

Head Over Heels,"Last weekend I saw ""Once Upon A Time ... In Hollywood"". I am a big fan of Tarantino's films but this was so much better than even I had expected. It is much more nuanced than all his previous work but just as bold and interesting. It has just about the best and most immersive vibe, visually and narratively, of any contemporary film I have seen. To find anything equal or better in that sense I have to go back to movies like The Third Man, Rumble Fish, Runaway Train, or Terrence Malick's work. The last surprise this pleasant at a film I knew I would like going in was Blade Runner 2049. Just one non-spoiler spoiler. You are going to love the ending. One of these days they should finally give Brad Pitt an Oscar. Maybe this will do it. Incidentally, you could watch this just to see Dakota Fanning as a frightening villain.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

At times a yawner but what an ending!,"Any two and a half hour plus movie has very likely some unnecessary footage. I'm going to estimate about 5% of the film was just Brad Pitt driving a car. Not being a woman, it got a little long.
The acting was great and there a few burst out loud laughs, but the highlight of the movie, it's saving grace, was the ending.
In classic Tarantino fashion it was a super high tense and insane situation yet it had a comical edge to it. And of course it came complete with the unique graphic violence we all luv and expect from him!
Although entertaining overall it could have easily been a two hour movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Boring!,"My goodness this movie drags!Glacially slow pacing. Flabby scenes where a character gets out of his car, looks left, looks right, takes a step, pauses, lights a cigarette, looks left again, etc, etc...
I ended up cutting my fingernails and doing some light cleaning to pass the time.I won't say it was all horrible; there were some nice moments in the first half - Rick Dalton's conversation with the girl actor at lunch time - and the final 20 minutes is fun. But, even the end is just a rehashing of the concept from Inglorious Basterds.If I don't care about a movie's characters then I can't give a passing grade. And, TBH, I didn't much care about any of these characters. RIck was a sniveling, coughing wreck and Cliff Booth was so cool it was unrealistic. Like, he went to Italy for six months, but kenneled his dog? On an out-of-work stuntman's salary?Much has been said about the immersive aspect of the set designs. Yea, I guess so. But, Oliver Stone's, The Doors, is more evocative of the 60's, IMO.***Not Highly Recommended***",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
It will help put you to sleep,"I can't believe all the high reviews for this film. While the acting was fine, there is no plot.. When you go see a QT film you expect great dialog, interesting characters and a craziness that only QT provides. This didn't have any of it. It seems liberal Hollywood has cut the balls of QT. This was as boring and dull as you can get. By the time the ending comes, and you get maybe 5 minutes of classic QT it doesn't matter anymore. Very disappointed.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
Needs the second watch,"I got to say when i first watched the film i was confused, the film itself follows an odd narrative structure (I mean it's Tarantino ,like it ever was gonna follow a normal one) I still enjoyed it, but it felt off when watching it. i had a similar emotional curve watching pulp fiction. didn't enjoy it on the first watch but came to love it and each and ever watch it grows on me more and more. My brief summary would be, It's long, if you don't have an appreciation for 60's retro groove, the Hollywood system and stunning indulged cinematography the film may seem slow. This isn't helped by Tarantino's particular but resonating Dialogue. The last 30 minuets on the other hand, i can't imagine anyone not liking, its Bloody brilliant ;)For a person who doesn't appreciate the above... The question is whether you're willing to sacrifice two hours for a 30 minute climaxNow as to why i believe it requires a second watch, when watching for the first time everything is unexpected or at least could be. Anything could happen. Your brain is scowering for a plot, and in this film there isn't one, you're wondering what act of the film your in, will it end in 10 minuets? 5 minuets? This is true of all films but most of all Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. A second watch lets you relax and appreciate the subtle moments of the film, you know the end point of the film where its all heading towards. You're excited to see certain moments again, they may not be full of action but the acting and dialogue are superb. For me its a whole film chock full of the classic ""Royale with cheese"" which to me is the perfect Tarantino classic and why i gave it a 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

Historical Reimagining,"Once Upon A Time in Hollywood is absolutely fabulous. The dialogue isn't as clever as Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, but the acting is far superior. The liberals and feminists will complain about the role of Sharon Tate and making her story about men, but this movie isn't her story. It's a historical reimagining. It's a showing of the times, and how everyone any one moment can change if something just a bit different would have happened. People need to stop being so damn sensitive and close minded. DiCaprio and Pitt put on fantastic performances, and Robbies Tate is terrific.The Bruce Lee scene as well as the finale steal the show. Go into this open minded and you'll see an instant classic. From the acting, to the soundtrack, to just the nostalgic feel, I can't stop thinking about it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

Well... it's official ol buddy... we got an instant frickin' classic on our hands! 10/10 ⭐,"Believe the hype. Believe the 10 star reviews. OUATIH exceeds every expectation with its mind-blowing attention to detail, superb dialogue, incredible performances and, most of all, its overwhelming love for the movies. Tarantino's illustrious career has culminated in this stylishly nostalgic journey that takes us back to everything great about the 60s. Every detail of this period is done to a tee; and it's in all the most minute aspects, whether it be a can of dog food or a radio station, where this film is elevated to masterpiece status.Remember when Jules and Vincent instantly became one of cinemas classic duos in Pulp Fiction? You can now confidently say the same thing about Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth - Leo and Brad give performances of a lifetime as these endearing, hilarious and, at times, even heart-rending characters. They're joined by a beyond stellar supporting group that's filled beautifully by the likes of Margot Robbie, Timothy Oliphant, Al Pacino, (the late) Luke Perry, Emile Hirsch and many more who all breathe life into this wonderfully unique and engaging story.All in all, it's a fantastic dive into the Golden Age that's fulls of twists at every turn and shines even brighter in its quieter moments when it's love for everything old cinema is at the forefront of its telling. At its core, it's invigorated by a guy whose talent as a storyteller is exceeded only by his sheer love for film and that is Mr. Quentin Tarantino. And for anyone who thinks the runtime could/should have been shorter, remember that QT was trying to make many of us who had never grown up/experienced that era (like myself) feel close to it. This meant every seemingly trivial scene/moment's sole purpose was to create as authentic an atmosphere as he could've conjured up.It's as ambitious a vision as one could muster and he truly nailed it with flying colors, creating a fairytale that enthrals you in ways you never knew were possible. I hope he's lying when he says he's ready to call it quits but I'll be damned if this isn't the best way possible to go out. It's official ol buddy... we got a darn frickin classic on our hands!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"

Tarantino's Magnum Opus,"Truly an outstanding film on all levels. Leonardo DiCaprio shows off his acting chops in every scene, reflecting how versatile and dynamic he is; his passion shines through. Brad Pitt is also wonderful in the film, portraying DiCaprio's loyal friend and companion. Every scene has been carefully crafted, every word carefully written, every detail has been filmed with fidelity. Tarantino personifies his love for film making in an amazing love letter to the old days of Hollywood.Reflecting on Tarantino's previous works, one can see how he arrived at this destination, and why Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a culmination of his life work. There are elements from all of his films such as Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown (especially this one), and even Kill Bill. His ability to raise tension through dialogue is paramount to his film's successes, and has become a staple.The film organically builds the two friend's relationship and characters, bringing a delight to behold on screen; there are so many other characters Tarantino is able to bring to life as well, with some of them having very little dialogue at all. He leaves the audience wanting to know more about these characters, without having to develop them. Margot Robbie steals every scene she is in, and brings about a warm innocence to her character.Overall this film is a must-see, in a time when theaters are full of remakes, reboots, and sequels; this one stands out for its originality, and a golden era of Hollywood films, much of which is forgotten today. Tarantino's love and passion for his work truly shows here, and what we receive as his audience is a masterpiece to behold, and a 2 hour 41 minute film we wish could keep on going.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
A Bittersweet Fairytale,"Once Upon a Time In Hollywood is Quentin Tarantino's 9th film, and the standard he set himself with his previous work and without a doubt this movie has lived up to it. The characters are well-written and explored in great detail and acted amazingly, especially by Margot Robbie and Brad Pitt.The movie has a very distinct tone. It's a mood-film that serves as an experience to drop into. Setting a tone and exploring the scenery, period and characters seems to be primary next to Story and I love that. Whereas I think some people may have a problem with the scenes playing more to developing a world rather than telling a story, I loved each set-piece and small story that took place.There's definitely some pacing issues with the beginning but the way the third act is written and the tone of the middle section makes up for it. I especially love how fairytale the movie is, everything is very perfect and intentionally cheesy which fits in with the title beginning with ""Once Upon a Time,"". This is a movie that takes place in its own movie world, where everything plays out like movies do but in reference to a real life event, something horrible and completely unfairytale, since movies, especially ones from the 60s, are meant to be, distractions from the horrific reality. This movie takes something horrible and inserts two cheesy action heroes into it, mocking the escapism found in classic cinema.The movie has beautiful cinematography and editing choices and a very neatly-chosen soundtrack. It may be too slow-paced in certain parts but that's something I can get behind

A love letter to lost innocence,"The sixties came to a crashing end with the Manson family murders, and Tarantino's tour de force laments that end with pathos and imagination. His best film since Pulp Fiction 25 years ago, it builds slowly through languid character-building scenes to the shocking conclusion. John Wick it ain't, and if you have the attention span of a gnat you won't like this film. I can't imagine any cinephile not loving it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama"
