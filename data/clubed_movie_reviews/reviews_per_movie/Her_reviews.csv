This is not a love story,"While I enjoy this movie for what it is, I simply have to disagree with all of those who portray this movie as some beautiful love story. This movie is about love, but it is not a love story. Without giving away any spoilers, if you want to understand the movie pay attention to the very last act of the main character when the movie ends. The movie is about relationships and how difficult human relationships especially can be. However in the end because we are human those are the only relationships we can truly have - are with each other - and the hurt and vulnerability and sometimes pain that come with them is simply something we have to accept. And no matter how much you love or care for a person sometimes it just doesn't work out. However that does not mean that you did not love or care for that person and to a certain extent will always. This is what the main character realizes and comes to understand at the end of the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"""The Heart is Not Like a Box"" (dialog)","Fairly rare one of a kind film.A high concept film that actually stays true to its core idea yet without losing viewer interest.Some irony here. While the film never becomes completely predictable, even to a jaded reviewer like this one, its process of de-constructing human relationship (brilliant, and better than all Woody Allen's films combined) generates the sequential ""connections"" with the viewer (ie, experiences that every viewer can relate to) which in turn keep the empathy going long after the initial sci fi ""wow"" is gone.Watching this (as an aside) you have to wonder if Scarlett Johansson's career can get any more interesting? In the Marvel films she plays an uber-woman, In LUCY she a woman who evolves beyond evolution itself. And here yet again she plays an OS that transcends reality.Makes for a nice resume.Notice how Amy Adams plays every scene with no makeup? Talk about a director making every effort to keep an actor's natural beauty from hijacking the film...?",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"In a word, brilliant","Science fiction has been dominated by 'space westerns' for so long that the occasional concept- based story situation hits a big number on my personal richter scale.What does it mean to be human? And if we create near-humans what is our responsibility to them and what is their relationship to us? These themes underpinned Blade Runner and Spielberg's A.I. And Sci Fi of the 50s and 60s dealt with machine self awareness. None of the films that touched on this subject in the past presented it so thoroughly, intimately and believably.Her is in the near future, but everything we see is within reach now: the isolation and starkness of the ""business district,"" the oppressive scale of the architecture (with thin, clumsy attempts to soften its sterility) and the need for continuous connection to remote voices.A personal assistant that learns independently and takes initiative for its hapless user, ""Her"" is at once the ideal tool and — who knows — perhaps closer to the next level of evolution.Pitch perfect performances and direction kept me in the story. As others have said, the locations, cinematography and even music shine in the fabric of this film. Spike Jonze is a master story weaver at the top of his game. Joaquin Phoenix is utterly credible as are all the other leads. Even Scarlett Johansson, who has not always seemed a strong actress to me performs utterly convincingly.It's an adult-themed film in more ways than one, but especially in the best way: it makes you think about a reality that's right around the corner.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

I love everything about Her,"This is the best film I have seen all year, and I saw just about every good film to hit theaters in 2013. I think it's because it is so representational of what it's like to be human.There are so many things that make this movie special, but I'll just mention a few.1. The score is INCREDIBLE. The music paired with the beautiful sound design make you FEEL the movie. Sure, you see everything on the screen, which is already beautiful, but then that music hits you and the emotions just start to run. I laughed, I cried, my brain got all tingly. It was an emotional roller coaster, and the score assisted in that so well.2. The script. I knew how this movie was going to end 30 minutes in. And unlike most who would then say that it's predictable and not worth watching, I consider that awesome, because it means that the script is tight enough to tell a good story with a believable arc. Every scene in this movie is straight up powerful! Like it will fill your heart with sadness and happiness and pain and guilt and confusion. And then rinse and repeat. For 2 hours. It moves through all of the most complex and interesting questions that we should be asking ourselves about what it means to be a human being. About what it means to be alive. This film is about all that life is. And after the screening, as well as during, I found myself questioning things in my own life that either don't make sense or don't have to make sense. Like love and thoughts and emotions. They're all so natural and yet none of us truly understand how they work. In my opinion, moreso than any other film this year, Her has the perfect mix of complex ideas, story, and character development. One of the best scripts ever written.3. Cinematography. My personal favorite shot to see and use is the extreme close up. And that shot was all over this movie. The reason I love it so much and believe it works so well is because it allows you to see the emotions of the character so plainly. Like their face is right in your face, so you just have to look at it. And that's where Joaquin shines. He delivers such a powerful and emotional performance and the close ups are there to capture it all. They also make great use of the natural backlighting of Shanghai, and the colors all fuse to make it a really pretty movie. I'd say the cinematography is on par with Drive and/or Lost in Translation in terms of the style. It looks like every shot was photographed with the intent to make it the most beautiful shot in the film. And I admire the DP's work. He did a really great job.More than anything though, this film just made me feel. Everything about it was so beautiful. I didn't want it to end. I felt like the film was controlling me - playing with my mind as if it were a joystick. And that's just something you don't get every day. Very rarely am I awe- stricken by a movie, and this film made my jaw drop. It is without a doubt the best film of the year, and upon just one viewing, one of my top 5 favorite movies of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
It's all I ever wanted,"Okay let's get something straight: There is nothing I love more than badass, exhilarating movies! The Joker performing his little pencil magic trick, Indiana Jones dodging traps and swinging his lion-taming whip at enemies, the bride in kill bill punching her way out of a closed coffin with her bare hands, John McClane single-handedly annihilating an airplane in mid-air while exclaiming the best one-liner known to mankind and I could go on and on...HOWEVER, nothing compares to the emotional rollercoaster the movie ""Her"" took me. It's nothing short of a masterpiece, a unique way of describing a love story and it makes you think of what it actually means to be human.
I just didn't want it to end and even after multiple rewatches, it still manages to take me off guard and make me tear up because of how beautiful and sad at the same time it all is. I can't remember any movie being able to achieve that. So yeah, definitely check this one out.And for those who are wondering: this is my third favourite movie of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"Not a movie for the kids, but very insightful and rather sad.","""Her"" is a film set in the very, very near future. Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) is a very lonely and emotionally constricted man. He's getting a divorce and seems very isolated--even though he lives in a huge city. One day, he decides to upgrade to a new hyper-intelligent operating system--one that claims to have a real personality. Well, it turns out to be so and then some. In fact, the computer OS, Samantha (Scarlett Johansson), is like a person in so many ways that soon it becomes all- important to Theodore and eventually it's his girlfriend. Where all this goes is a very slow journey, but it's also quite beautiful.This film, while sci-fi, doesn't seem outside the realm of possibility. In this often disconnected and cold world, such a relationship seems like a safe alternative. Healthy, of course not--but very safe for a scarred person who wants intimacy but who is afraid to seek it. I thought the film had a really interesting message about this and is well worth seeing. My only reservation is that the film is VERY adult--with phone sex and a bit of nudity you probably wouldn't want your kids to see. Plus, at times the film feels a bit creepy. Good...but a bit sad and creepy. Well worth your time and an interesting performance by Phoenix and a really amazing film by Spike Jonze.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
HER - a visually beautiful ode the technological age,"Spike Jonze's latest feature 'Her', set in the not-too-distant future, tells the story of Theodore Twombly (Phoenix) who finds himself falling in love with 'Samantha', an advanced operating system voiced by the sultry Scarlett Johansson. It is clear to see why this film was chosen by the National Board of Review as the best film of 2013: the visual style and extensive use of pastel colours is a triumph in itself, and the acting, editing, costumes and screenplay are all worthy of recognition.I went to an awards screening of 'Her' and was pleased to find out that the film was not at all what I was expecting. It has such a distinct style, and Joaquin Phoenix carries the film with tremendous grace as the complicated and sensitive protagonist. The film is mostly Phoenix alone with Johansson's voice (reminiscent of Sandra Bullock in 'Gravity' or Robert Redford in 'All Is Lost' - two other 2013 films mainly revolving around one solitary character), but the audience never feels abandoned by the lack of other characters as we begin to forget that 'Samantha' is just really just a computer.'Her' is a complex film with a much deeper meaning that lies beneath the surface. A beautifully crafted motion picture, this quirky love story is sure to resonate with you once you've seen it. It is an extremely interesting (and realistic) look at the future - Jonze's quaint and poignant film is a must-see! 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Really interesting film with an original concept,"This film was not at all what I was expecting but in a great way! I'm not a fan of Rom Coms or romances generally, and this film isn't that, although it has romantic elements to a degree. This film is more sci-fi than anything with a really interesting and fascinating twist, but also creepy and unsettling concept of relationships with an artificial intelligence. This film was perfectly cast and I can't think of better individuals to play each role. Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johansson do an incredible job!!!!!!! The film was paced perfectly and didn't drag at all. The film explores the themes of human interaction, emotional ranges of humans, the concept of love, companionship, loneliness, physical touch and so much more. I really enjoyed this film both for it's originality and the ability to make you sit in discomfort but want to explore further. This film makes you reflect on the relationships in your own life, life generally and the world as a whole. This film is beautiful in its cinematography, the musical score and I'm surprised it isn't more renowned. Honestly, a masterpiece in my opinion. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Just about the best thing you can see in 2013...,"Talk about closing with a bang. Spike Jonze's long-awaited original film about a writer that falls in love with his operating system is not only the best film to play at this year's New York Film Festival; it very well could be the very best film of the year. ""Her"" is the finest writing and directorial endeavor of Spike Jonze's career. And then there's the towering and crowning work of Academy Award nominee Joaquin Phoenix who proves once again, he's the finest actor working today, hands down. You can't find a more dynamic and compelling story about the human connection and where we're headed as a society.When ""Her"" opens up, it snaps you immediately into the story. Phoenix plays Theodore, a writer for a website that makes letters for just about anyone. As he tries to find life during the midst of his divorce from his wife Catherine (played by a beautiful Rooney Mara), Theodore finds solace in a friendship with a new OS (operating system) named Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson). The two develop a relationship in a world where OS's are becoming the norm with society.Jonze's has never been the conventional director as we've seen in his other brilliant efforts ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Where the Wild Things Are."" Jonze sets out to tell a story and deliver all the intricate details for us to understand each character. His focus on Theodore, giving him a real sense of loneliness without falling into cliché character ticks and beats that we've seen countless times in other romantic films, Jonze constructs a real man living in a world where technology has taken precedent over human connection.Christopher Nolan should take notes from Jonze on the assembling of female counterparts in a story. Catherine and Theodore's friend Amy, played by the always dependable Amy Adams, both feel genuinely authentic. Mara, who's already delivered one other powerful performance in ""Ain't Them Bodies Saints"" earlier this year, is finely utilized. She shows once again that she's a true professional, with limited screen time (many in flashbacks); she can staple herself in your memory.Amy Adams is always the sprinkle on top in all of her films. As ""Amy,"" the awkward friend and neighbor who sympathizes more with Theodore more than she'd like to, Adams expertly executes. With four prior Oscar nominations to her credit, her stunning portrayal is just another fantastic pin to add to her credits. She could find traction during the awards season if the film hits in the right way. That's also part to the petty Oscar rules about rewarding voice performances because if that wasn't the case, Scarlett Johansson would be on stage holding an Oscar of her own next March. As ""Samantha,"" Johansson has never tapped into the essence of her abilities as an actress the way she does in ""Her."" As an OS, full of wonder and curiosity, ""Samantha"" is essentially a child. Learning at a rapid rate and studying the behaviors of the human mind, she looks at the world through the eyes of Theodore. Johansson holds our hand in through the tale, even when her voice isn't on screen. This is the type of work that could convince the Board of Governors to rethink the eligibility of an acting performance. This is a masterful work that I'll remember for years to come.And then there's Joaquin Phoenix...oh, Mr. Phoenix. Fresh off his historic performance in Paul Thomas Anderson's ""The Master"" just a year ago, I didn't think he could impress me so soon and yet here we are. His sensitive and perceptive take on the role is what films are all about. It's one of the best things that 2013 has offered and a performance that could land him his first Oscar. I think Phoenix himself was impressed with the work he and his colleagues have accomplished. At the press conference, he actually gave an answer to one of the questions from the audience. If anyone was in attendance at the conference for James Gray's ""The Immigrant"" - a prickly, disengaged Phoenix put on his sunglasses and put the microphone on the floor. This is a performance that you can identify with. He's not simply awkward for the sake of being, he has baggage and connection issues. There's sincerity in his words and mannerisms. A getaway in a cabin, alone but with ""Samantha"" encapsulates everything about Theodore. Phoenix achieves the impossible and is an instant Oscar contender.But ""Her"" isn't just about the writing and performances; it's an all- around technical marvel. Most notably the Production Design of K.K. Barrett, who has worked on ""Where the Wild Things Are."" Our story takes place in a futuristic (though never said how far ahead) Los Angeles and with shooting overseas, Barrett captures the clout of the city and its inside counterparts. Cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema's use of colors and smooth palettes are things of a dream. Affectionately snuggling up to Phoenix as he whispers the sweetness of words to ""Samantha"" or the sweetness of a new letter at work, Hoytema has quickly become one of my favorite DP's, especially following ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" and ""Let the Right One In."" Arcade Fire and Karen O. are simply magic in their music that accompanies our story about love. A modern yet classical composition that in key scenes could move you to tears.""Her"" is one of the best love stories I've witnessed in some time. Charlie Kaufman will always have the honor of penning my favorite love story of all-time ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" but Spike Jonze and ""Her"" are giving it a true run for the money at the moment.

Cyber romance with hearty humanity.,"""It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity."" Albert EinsteinNo better romance is on the screen in 2013 than Spike Jonze's insightful Her. It's about a writer in the future, Theodore, who falls in love with his new operating system (gravelly, sexy voice of Scarlett Johansson), just as he is reluctantly divorcing Catherine (Rooney Mara). The always complicated paths of love make sense as we witness the Platonic relationship develop, sans flesh and sans insanity that usually comes with that flesh.Her is a simple film that offers a view of love I never thought could come from a machine and its software. Although critics will cite the theme as a screed against the distancing of technology and our growing isolation from each other, and they will be right, I offer the sub theme that only when we strip ourselves of sensual bonds can we see the purity of emotional love, an essence of which Plato would have approved. Yes, although technology is mediating our lives at a rapid pace, we fall back to a personal drive to love and be loved that is physical in its best form but understood best if we can distance ourselves from that physicality.This delightfully intimate and non-violent film from acclaimed absurdist director Spike Jonze is more emotionally involving than even Enough Said (one of 2013's best romances) because the interaction between the software and the man is all verbal, no glimpse of the gorgeous Johansson allowed. Although this intuitive OS does allow mind sex, even that activity is abstract, allowing us to realize how connecting with a live human is in the mind still and one of life's great gifts, orgasm or not.Her allows us to witness the evolution of love separate from the encumbrances of physicality. Released from the bonds of appearance, voice is the seducer, not in rude sexual nuance but rather in the care that comes from love of the mind, not the body.K.K. Barrett's production design, Austin Gorg's art direction, and Gene Serdena's set decoration are memorable: full of comfortable light, much glass overlooking the city, and modern but warm furniture both in LA and Singapore. These artists understand that the fusion of technology and art is not a battle but a collaboration that further helps us understand the intricate workings of human emotion.""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.""

Her is Spike Jonze's finest film yet,"I've been a fan of Spike Jonze's films since I first saw Being John Malkovich. Although the wonderful script deserves some of the credit for making that film so great, it was immediately clear to me that Spike Jonze was a director with a fresh and imaginative perspective. His next film, the 2002 meta-comedy Adaptation, confirmed this with its dry wit and multilayered narrative. Now, after a slightly less successful (but still enjoyable) adaptation of Where The Wild Things Are, Spike Jonze has written and directed his most complete and poignant film yet, Her.The story, taking place in a near future when people spend more time talking to their computers than they do to each other, stars Joaquin Phoenix as Theodore Twombly, a lonely man whose job is to write heartfelt personal letters for people not willing to do it themselves. Theodore happens to see an ad for a new computer operating system that is programmed with a personality, and decides to give it a shot. His new operating system Samantha, voiced by Scarlett Johansson, is not only intelligent but also charming and understanding, and she and Theo quickly fall in love.It's understandable if that premise sounds bizarre on paper, but in execution Her is far more sweet than creepy. The film radiates warmth and intelligence, and there is a fair amount of witty humor to ensure that it never becomes too self-serious. It has an engaging style similar to that of Sofia Coppola's Lost In Translation. Like in that film, there's a certain poetic yet whimsical quality to the dialogue in Her and both the main characters are plagued by feelings of loneliness.Beyond the romance though, Her has a lot to say about modern society's obsession with technology. The people in this futuristic vision of Los Angeles walk around talking to their computers and ignoring each other entirely, not unlike people today staring at their cell phones rather than talking to those around them. Needless to say it's not a wildly original message, but it's communicated in a unique enough way that it works.I've seen Her twice now, and the more I think about it the more I feel that Spike Jonze has crafted the best film of 2013. Her is equally heartfelt and heartbreaking, a deeply personal and thoroughly enjoyable futuristic love story.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Her,"Well, I wasn't prepared for that. Her is such a haunting and intimate look into loneliness and sorrow, and happiness and love. It's a film that anyone who has ever felt lonely or heartbroken will immediately relate to. But it's also an incredibly personal experience.The more I have thought about this wonderful film that I just saw, the more I realize how impactful it was to me. It was heartwarming yet heartbreaking. It was sad yet funny. Like life, it was a rollercoaster of emotions. One minute you are laughing and the next you are crying. There is no right or wrong, there are just our feelings and emotions and the way we process them.For me, the most impactful part of this film was the sense of loneliness. Anyone who has experienced it knows that it isn't easy. And even though I'm completely fine with being by myself most of the time, there is always that longing to find that someone. This movie captured that feeling so incredibly perfectly.That's where the beauty of this film lies. We can all reflect our experiences and feelings into this movie and it will reflect something back. It turns into such a personal experience and journey, that it becomes impossible to put it into words. I don't think that I have ever experienced anything quite like Her, at least when it comes to cinema. I can already tell now that I won't be able to stop thinking about this film for the next couple of days.I think that everyone should see this film at least once in their life. It's a journey of discovery and reflection. Trying to explain what this film is, is simply impossible. It's something that one needs to experience for themself.Also, can we just talk about that final shot? I don't think that it gets much more perfect than that.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Soon Samantha develops her feelings and they fall in love with each other. The insecure Theodore feels divided for loving a computer system while Samantha does not stop to grow-up and evolve.""Her"" is an original movie by the cult writer and director Spike Jonze. The story is emotional and the viewer shares the feelings of love of Theodore and Samantha. The plot is developed in a future not far from the present days and it is easy to understand the need of a writer to write letters since the persons are too individualist, walking on the streets talking to their computers, cellphones or tablets and certainly incapable to write letters with feelings. The conclusion is predictable since fortunately we are still humans. If you liked this movie, see also ""Thomas est Amoureux"" (2000) that you may have a nice surprise.

Her- Spike Jonze's Prophetic Reflection on Social Isolation and the Dependency on Evolving Technologies is as Sweet as it is Disconcerting,"At the heart of every truly great science-fiction film there is an emphasis on character that aims to reflect on some element of the human condition usually intended to open our minds to thought provoking predictions or eerily warn of an impending reality. We've seen numerous examples of these contemplative films throughout the very existence of cinema stemming all the way back to Fritz Lang's haunting futuristic piece Metropolis and has inspired countless others in its thoughtful wake as seen in memorable cinematic creations such as Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker, and even Duncan Jones' Moon. Never to be a director to back away from experimental presentation or psychological study, Spike Jonze's Her fully embraces this reflective science-fiction quality by peering into the deep sociable aspects of the human psyche giving us more of a prophetical reality than a fictional reflection. In his latest film Jonze creates a disconcerting yet equally endearing romance between a secluded depressive and his female operating system with an evolving consciousness, basically a HAL-9000 homage from Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, that brings to light a commentary on our dependency of programmed living and our need to maintain sociability when direct communication avenues have been stricken from life's normality. Rarely do ambitious films meet idyllically with their inquisitive potential, but Jonze has fashioned a delicately profound science-fiction contemplation that is depicted through the thoughtfulness of character alone that brims with wry humor, authentic pain, and charming revelation. Through the use of beautiful cinematography, impeccable production design, and subtle yet evocative performances, Her becomes a multilayered film experience where its character study of an isolated man afraid to become vulnerable again blends harmoniously with a truly unconventional yet naturally heartfelt romance. Jonze's affinity and ambition for presenting psychological challenges, as he has done before with Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, and especially in Where the Wild Things Are, finally collides with emotionally piercing conveyance within Her making it as thought provoking and as it is undeniably sweet. If the sole purpose of the science-fiction genre is to expound on societal, moral, and deeply psychological aspects of our human condition than Her fits soundly within that genre's capabilities by capturing our condition's essential need for sociability and love uncomfortably linking it with our antisocial dependency on technology.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
The best film of 2013 is Her.,"I saw Her this weekend, and it's my favorite movie of the year. Everything about it was fantastic: the acting, the directing, the writing. It could've easily been a clichéd look at technology or the future, but it's fundamentally a very human story about evolution. It's about having to deal with unfulfillment and things like divorce and loneliness, but it's also undercut with hope, whether it be through Theo's relationships with Samantha (Johansson) and Amy (Adams) or even the stylistic touches, like having Theo's red clothes set against a muted Los Angeles background. There are parallels drawn between all the characters' journeys without it feeling contrived, and even Theo's job--writing letters for other people--represents his relationship with his OS; on the surface, they may seem like ""just letters"" or ""just a computer"", but they're outlets for his emotions and desires.Oh, and everyone in the cast is phenomenal; it's a shame Johansson is ""ineligible"" for an award. BS.

One of the best in 2013!!!,"Though director Spike Jonze collaborated with Charlie Kaufman on Being John Malkovich and Adaptation, the latter didn't have a hand in Jonze's assured, moving fourth feature, but his spirit—fiendishly inventive, casually postmodern, self-lacerating, fearless, funny, and ultimately deeply sad—pervades the film. With Her, Jonze beautifully realizes a future Los Angeles where a lovesick man (Joaquin Phoenix) in the midst of a devastating divorce is so desperate for intimacy that he falls hopelessly in love with an artificially intelligent operating system, voiced by Scarlett Johansson. Jonze's screenplay acknowledges the innate absurdity of the film's premise while spinning it into an elegant, heartbreaking depiction of human loneliness and the innate need for connection. For the setting, Jonze plugged into the current era's technological mania to say something timeless and profound about love, loss, and evolving desire.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Sorry but I Just Couldn't Connect With It,"Her (2013)** (out of 4)Spike Jones' futuristic love story about a lonely man (Joaquin Phoenix) going through a divorce who falls in love with a computer system (voiced by Scarlett Johansson). HER is being considered by many to be one of the greatest films of 2013 and one of the best love stories in recent years. I really wish I could feel the same because while I respect what Jones was going for, for the life of me I couldn't help but feel this really wasn't any different than the countless other bad love stories out there. I really, really tried to enjoy this film more than I did but in the end I just found it to be way too predictable, pretentious and boring. I will start off with the biggest problem and that's the Samantha character, which of course is the computer system. So let me get this straight. This system is supposed to be super intelligent yet in reality she's just as stupid as any other female character in a bad romance because who with any intelligence would fall for someone like Phoenix? I mean, he's really just a depressed man with some serious mental issues. Shouldn't this intelligent system have picked up on this? There wasn't a single second of this film that I actually connected with and there certainly wasn't any emotional connection to the Samantha character. The sex scenes? Just didn't work. The weird double date? Nah, didn't work. How about the ""other"" woman who is brought in for the sex? None of it worked for me. Again, I respect what Jones was trying to do but in the end I thought the screenplay was rather hollow. Phoenix is one of my favorite actors and I thought he offered up another great performance. I certainly believed him as this character and he certainly made me think that someone like this could fall for a computer. Amy Adams and Rooney Mara are both good but I must say I didn't think either one had a very good role. As for Johansson, I thought she did an extremely good job with the vocal work and managed to bring some real emotion to the voice but was it really any better than some of the stuff we see in animated movies? Obviously, if you can connect with the man-computer story then I'm sure you're going to enjoy this much more. The film has some wonderful cinematography and the score is great but there just wasn't anything here for me to really connect to.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"Fell WAY short of expectations, and not appropriate for all agess","Joaquin Phoenix unfortunately committed career suicide several years ago, and after 5 or so years of consuming mass quantities of alcohol and illegal substances, and giving Hollywood the middle finger, it looked like he was ready to make nice and put his acting talent back to good use. Although I've enjoyed most of his past movies, I really didn't miss him much while he was gone, particularly since he did it all to himself. Still, when I saw the previews for this movie and what it was about, it looked intriguing and I thought it had a good premise that would make for a cute, offbeat romantic comedy of sorts. I decided to see it with my 24yo daughter, which quickly became a little awkward for both of us when JP started visually fantasizing about having sex with a near full-term pregnant woman, and another chick that got off by being beaten with a dead cat during sex. Oh yeah, and let's not forget his operating system (voice by Scarlett Johannson) that pondered what @n@l sex would look like. There was also a lot of gratuitous use of explicit words and imagery that just totally didn't fit in at all with the theme of the movie, but that's the least of the issues I had with it. The list just goes on and on. Cute romantic comedy suitable for watching with the entire family??? Not so much!!! It just dumbfounds me that anybody would think those things belong in a movie such as this, or at least the way the previews/trailers projected the movie to be. It was all as out of place as it would've been in something like Sleepless In Seattle. I'm hardly a prude by any measure, but none of that stuff had any place in this movie, and some of it had no place in almost any other movie I can think of, except perhaps the documentary that Casey Affleck made when Joaquin Phoenix decided to quit acting (""I'm Still Here""). Having your ""friend"" cr@p into your mouth while you're sleeping fits right in with some of the stuff that was in this movie. It really makes no sense, because the middle half of the movie is exactly what you'd expect it to be... a slightly zany, offbeat romantic comedy (though with very little comedy) about a guy that falls in love with his computer and his smart phone's operating system. Aside from the wildly inappropriate content earlier on in the movie, the ending was absolutely HORRIBLE. I won't give out any spoilers of course, but it was completely as if the writers just had NO IDEA of where to go with the story and how to wind it up!!! The ending was just totally nonsensical and empty! The sort of ending where you're watching a scene and you say to yourself ""Don't EVEN tell me this is the end of the movie?!?!"". My advice, DEFINITELY wait until it's out on DVD/Blu-Ray and spend $1 or $2 to rent it from Redbox or watch it on Netflix. I certainly wouldn't suggest anybody spend $20-$40+ to see it in theaters, and I definitely wouldn't recommend taking any children younger than mid teens to see it solely due to those few scenes. It's really too bad, because those scenes added NOTHING to the movie, weren't funny imho, and did nothing but take a movie that should've been appropriate for almost all ages, and make it completely inappropriate for children under 13-15.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Multilayered science fiction,"I recently watched Her for the 3rd time. I really like this movie. It's the kind of movie which goes beyond just watching it. It generates thoughts and feelings which last awhile. It has a fabulous aftertaste, in a manner of speaking. I want to savor it for a time after each viewing. Even the seemingly off putting letter writing as a business thing acts as a kind of commentary. Overall, I found the script and acting almost musical. Speaking of music, I thought that they did a really good job with matching the soundtrack to the events in the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"Magical, if polarising, film-making","Granted, 'Her' is not for everybody, likewise with Spike Jonze films in general, people may find the slow pacing a turn off and the premise while unlike any other premise is weird and may be ridiculous for many.However, this reviewer was one of those who loved 'Her', while acknowledging that it has imperfections. 'Her' did feel longer than it needed to be, which meant that the pacing did drag a bit in the second half and lost tightness, it could easily have been 20-25 minutes shorter.The ending is also very predictable and easy to figure out early on. While the cast are exemplary, Kristin Wiig felt a little out of place in her role.Flaws aside, while polarising and a love it/hate it film, 'Her' this reviewer found to be magical film-making. For example, 'Her' is a gorgeous-looking film with the cinematography, with a lot of use of extreme close up, some of the most beautiful of any film in recent years and maybe ever (and there are a lot of films with beautiful cinematography) and the scenery and colours positively eye-popping.Also present are one of the best music scores personally ever heard (and music in film and television is very important to me to look out for, as a classically trained singer and cellist myself), it has such a wonderful dream-like hypnotic quality and complements the film's mood perfectly. As well as a beautifully crafted screenplay, with a deft balance of the hilarious, the poignant, the charming and the thoughtful. The story's pacing is deliberate, but this was necessary, making the most of the premise, the weirdness slightly alienated at first but turned out fascinating when stuck with and there is genuine emotional impact and a well-done message that doesn't feel too heavy-handed.Jonze's direction is superbly adept, while the characters are interesting and apart from Wiig the performances are exemplary. Particularly good are Joaquin Phoenix, in a towering performance that is almost on the same level as his spell-binding performance in Paul Thomas Anderson's 'The Master', and Scarlett Johansson, who voices Samantha with sultry sexiness. Amy Adams and Rooney Mara are charming and affecting in sympathetic female roles.In conclusion, will divide and has divided viewers and has its flaws (especially the length) but a magical piece of film-making. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

A letter from the void,"Regardless of the analysis on the quality of the film, I've never felt so much identified with a character. That guy is me. ""Her"" can pass like no other the idea of emptiness that surrounds each one of the people who inhabit it. The void is the main presence. The genius of the movie, from the plot to the aesthetics, transcends the physical, technical, technological, it inhabits the same void. In fact, I do not see this film by parts: it has a union, a cohesion, a completeness, which is what I find most prodigious, when all its elements (characters, if we may include Scarlett in this) seem disintegrated. And then, among many other issues that dance in my spirit and will not stop until the end of the real soundtrack, there is the philosophical side: a new questioning of to be or not to be. The point, contrary to what happens in ""The Matrix"", where that inverted paradigm is poured as a doctrine, everything here falls on me( would be nice to tell on us), in the days following the viewing, like those small particles that light reveals in one of the last images of the film. Given the ubiquity of the void within which our body and all the forces that attract us to it are absolute exceptions, the question is: who is, after all, the programmed? As far as I understand, and Spike Jonze helped to reinforce that conviction, we don't really expand consciousness. Consciousness is this emptiness that surrounds us. It's up to us to allow, or not, it to penetrate us. And interestingly, what I think is that in each of the moments we do so we will register the paradox of feeling less empty .",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Romance in need of human contact,"Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix) is divorcing his wife Catherine Klausen (Rooney Mara) and drifting into a lonely existence. He's a letter writer and his most important relationship is to technology. Then he takes up an offer for the new OS1. It gave herself the name Samantha (Scarlett Johansson). Samantha seems more than a program and he finds himself falling for her more than any real human being.One thing is certain. Spike Jonze is an original. Scarlett plays Samantha like a real human being. I like the concept but I'm not sure if it's as good of a movie as everybody is saying. There is something about a real relationship that works best with human contact. Even a long distance relationship has two physical persons on the screen. The lack of a human body really holds it back although that's the point. She is a fantasy like a 1-900 number. It's just a very sophisticated version. It tries to get weird with a third person. However it could never be weird enough. I'm reminded of Cronenberg's Videodrome where James Woods dive into kissing the TV. It never goes that far. It approaches going for the next level but the movie fizzles out. It takes a weak way to wrap things up. In the end, Theodore is let off the hook. He doesn't have to be proactive and the story resolves itself.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Sci-Fi with a romantic streak,"I really like science fiction books and movies. All these future technologies, weapons, supercomputers - in a word, WOW. So, when I first heard about a new Sci-Fi movie, immediately ran to the cinema, sat down in front of the screen, and without watching a single trailer, prepared to enjoy the adventures of some space traveler. To be honest, I was surprised to see romantic melodrama. But it turned out, that ""Her"" was the best drama I have ever seen. Firstly, it was very interesting to look at the world of the future not through the eyes of a scientist or a traveler, but a normal person: to understand what actually you will meet in everyday life, if you get in the future. Secondly, love story is so unusual that I was surprised by the fact of the existence of such relations for a long time after watching. In addition, for me, as a programmer, it was exciting to watch the artificial intelligence in such manifestation. Also, I think that the film deservedly won an Oscar for best screenplay, because the story, which is told to us, is gorgeous. The film completely immerse you in its atmosphere, and, for the first time, you do not even want to return to reality when the movie ends. One more point I need to mark is music. Soundtrack is amazing - guys in Arcade Fire managed to create some wonderful compositions on piano that perfectly reflect the meaning of the film. So, I ask you to watch this movie, because it undoubtedly deserves your attention and will not leave you indifferent. 10 out of 10.

It's worth mentioning that, despite it's minimalism you won't get bored, as the plot it's a roller-coaster of emotions that will keep you glued to the screen till the end.Lastly, I would say that Joaquin Phoenix acting makes Theodore much more relatable, and Scarlett Johansson's voice is able to bring a human touch to one of the most synthetic think I could think of.Her is a beautiful movie and I think a must-watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

I can see why Theodore is so involved in the relationship, because this virtual relationship is so perfect and flawless. It lifts him from the trauma of his previous relationship, and ease the loneliness he feels. Still, the idea of a relationship with an operating system is still a bit too new for me.

Suspension of critical thought essential to this one,"A friend of mine from work recommended seeing the film; she told me that she thinks that I will like it.. I think she asked me twice. So I decided to see if my service provider has it in their library, and sure enough, they did.. Current IMDb rating gave it a 8.1, so...The first ten minutes or so give you a good idea of what the movie is going to be like.. Good design in props and a grand sense of 'high-tech' permeates throughout the film. The movie has a very gentle atmosphere.Central character is a shy, nice, decent guy that is dealing with a marital problem and an impending divorce. He is very confused and trying to fix the problems he has. So very early on in the story, there is a new operating system that you can install on your phone that will act as your personal secretary.One of the first few questions it asks you, so that it can customize it's ""DNA"" to suit your PA needs, is whether you would like a male or female voice, and why that was chosen.. It then turns out that this Operating System was programmed to have a very sexy, natural voice, complete with humanized timbres that and husk that make it unmistakably human.The first few useful bits turns out to be that it can check all your history of emails, SMS's and file and process them all in an instant, and deliver this to you in a sexy voice and ask what you would like to do about them, as well as reminding you about appointments when they're about to happen and so on. A bit like SIRI (Apple) but version 500.Then later on in the story things become a little unbelievable. When this computer program starts telling him that she thinks she's falling in love with him and feeling emotions.. OK , so this is where the film started losing me. How can a computer program start to feel ""giddy inside"", is the Operating System connected to a heart and stomach links to neural network of the brain, complete with hormones?? One can only assume that it was programmed to be a nasty trick on a whole lot of gullible, lonely people.But they give very little information about the creation or advertising of this Operating System, so one can only assume that the writers of it 'lost control' of their software? (Which is supposed to keep upgrading itself, even though it's OS1 lol).So lots of humanizing aspects of a girlfriend are thrown into this OS. The operating system ""misses him"", and even sends out pictures and copies of personal stuff that he wrote without asking him. His reaction to this news is acceptance and thanks for the good deed that it did for him.OK, there are some scenes where personal fantasies happen, one in particular where the screen goes dark for about a minute while the central character has voice sex with his digital assistant. Some reviewers I've read here appear to feel uncomfortable with that, which is weird since people don't complain when it comes to on-screen violence. There is nothing majorly awkward about those scenes, this stuff happens.. People should understand that, that aspect is far from overdone.So the story gets even weirder later on, his personal assistant actually decides to leave him. What a load of bunkum this operating system would be... If this film had any sense of realism there would be riots happening right after all the PA's left their 'real' lovers for another personal assistant. But it is a love story. More than anything, a love story about falling in love with a PA . Happy Valentines day ? ;) It is cute.But far from 8.1 stars out of ten, this really does not belong in the 8's and over time I am sure it will move down.My leaving thoughts - if you are critical thinking, you may have a hard time immersing yourself in this film.. But if you're willing to suspend belief and instead enjoy all the high-tech wizardry and let yourself go into this characters romance and the weird situations he puts himself in, then it go, it's an OK film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

An intelligent and nuanced sci-fi romance that satirises our current obsession with smart-phones to remind us for the need to connect with people.,"Set in a future not too far from our own - both in terms of time, technology and thematic ideology, this romantic science-fiction uses a satirical stance to take aim at the way we seem to be constantly more and more in love with the 'smart' screens we keep in our pockets. 'Her (2013)' relies on a kind of clairvoyant central premise, considering the 'insta-famous' social-media uprising - as well as our increasing obsession with both the people creating this 'content' and the devices fuelling our consumption of it - wasn't anywhere near as developed as it is today back when this film was first released. The flick makes a poignant point in the process of its satire, though, by crafting a nuanced, fully developed story that plays counter to the most obvious 'anti-A.I.' ideals, in almost every way possible, and becomes a much more 'real' experience while doing so. It would have been easy to just dismiss its central conceit, to use it as fuel for the fire of its larger satirical context, but instead its chosen path, of exploring the created avenue to its fullest potential, yields unexpected and fairly touching results. These outcomes don't negate the 'don't be consumed by your phone' message, they enhance it in a unique way. Using the titular OS as the person our protagonist knows her to be and pushing this connection as one we all should strive, for no matter in what form it comes, is an inspired and somewhat unexpected move. This kind of multi-layer thematic resonance is incredibly difficult to do but allows for a film rife with meaning, one that begs to be analysed. The fact that it has such a firm grasp on all of its themes, so that it can approach them from every angle and in unconventional ways, is impressive, to say the least. It means that the flick will reach people on a number of levels, whether or not they know why, and makes for an end result that's intelligent, well-crafted and, frankly, rather beautiful. The piece preaches connectivity, while having a number of other appropriate allegorical under-layers, and manages to be very enjoyable all while essentially being an incredibly entertaining two-hour phone-call. That's admirable. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

I will never forget how Her made me feel...,"It's been a while since I've seen Her but so much of this film is still etched into my memory. It's a film that I'll never forget.Her follows Theodore, a writer, that falls in love with his operating system.Her does have a basic premise but it's a love story that tells so much and is so relatable. Spike Jonze is a very unique director and has directed wildly original films like Being John Malkovich and Adaptation. Whilst he did direct those two, the praise really went to Charlie Kaufman for his excellent writing. Her is Jonze's first ever solo writing credit and this film shows his capabilities as a writer and not just a director. The script is an absolute winner here as I don't think any film has made me go through so many emotions in a short amount of time.The character of Theodore is someone a lot of people can relate to. We all long to have a strong connection with someone and be able to interact with other people. It's a struggle that a lot people go through and Jonze's representation of that struggle and loneliness is extremely well executed. The cinematography of the futuristic world in this film is beautiful. I loved how you are able to see how many people are glued to their gadgets. It's something that we tend to witness in the real world allowing the world of Her to feel largely realistic.The performances are absolutely brilliant. Joaquin Phoenix once again gives an excellent performances that's very heartfelt and will stick with you long after the film's done. Scarlett Johansson's voice work is astounding. Some of the best voice work I've heard in a film. Rooney Mara and Amy Adams are terrific as usual despite their shorter roles.Her is a very special film to me. It tells a story that takes you on a rollercoaster of emotions and explores feelings and love like no other film has.

heart-shaped hard-drive,"We all want to be loved, and love someone, and this is the simple but solid emotional point that Spike Jonze hits at in Her, like a musician playing a high spirited but melancholy song of sweetness and heartache (something the protagonist even requests his iPod to play).The film takes place in some point in the future - or, since we are never told exactly when, it could just as well be an alternative reality where people just need that one extra step being already hooked up to their devices - and is about a man who writes love letters and cards to others for a living. He's good at it because, well, it comes from inside him. But coming off a divorce that's left him ""confused"" as he says, an 'O.S.' Operating System, an artificially intelligent super computer that with a few simple questions is meant to be 'made' for that person, it's tempting enough to try. Going into the film, I thought it would be a sort of 'rom-com' only with a Hal 9000 (and can you say 'wackiness ensues' more than that).It's more complicated by how much Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson, so she sounds like the perfect gal already) is, a side from being a super organizer (she reads and organizes emails and correspondence), an emotional creature. But in a way this dug deeper than something Kubrick just scratched the surface at: if you can really 'be' there for someone, though not in full physical form, what does that do to the real human being on the other end? Joaquin Phoenix, aside from Jonzes delicate and mature screenplay and poetic direction, is the reason to see the picture. He imbues this 'Him' as a kind of sad dope but one that's a genuinely caring and nice fella but not always connected with his own emotions or knowing quite what to say. He is awkward with those glasses and mustache, he plays his oddball video games (an adorable aside in the film, a few times really), but projects a haunted, morose quality without it becoming tired or trite. At the same time he shows the happiness Jonze wants to portray in a relationship, whether it's with his current 'gf'.Or his once wife (Rooney Mara, and we get to know her so well mostly only through dialogue-less flash backbacks, with some editing input by Steven Soderbergh). He also plays well on some of the moments of comedy that do pop up in the film - it is Jonze, so as it is such a personal film the light and absurd comes in with the gloom - a part of this world But, like us, wondering 'what the hell is this now? Her does science fiction and technological 'if' material so well because of its subtlety. when you watch something like, I don't know, Elysium or even Minority Report, we know it's a future place and the fantasy is big and flashy and sometimes we know we are removed from that experience. Jonze wants this to just be like how it is today, and the sci-to 'catch' is there, for the most part, as a means to explore how we see and feel and experience one another.I left this film questioning so much how I can approach potentially expanding AI in the future (And now we have systems winning or at least even friggin playing on Jeopardy so it's only a matter of time emotional components are worked out). What does one do with the infinite possibilities with a self aware being. and as in Being John Malkovich, there's always another layer of chaos and wonder that is under the surface waiting to be explored, and in the third act the entire concept of an AI of this magnitude is given a frightening element: being in thousands of places at once but still 'here' at the same time, including love. But it doesn't ever quite 'feel' frightening, and that is a key thing that makes Her special.Another director might take the narrative into more conventional territory, like if Samantha and her other O.S. beings (which, after a while, they are) took over the world real Skynet style. It's still Tim Twombleys story, his journey into finding some semblance of peace with himself and the world, and if it feels at all like a personal film for Jonze it's because he sticks with that painful, powerful point of it all being about you, your other, and growth (along with the help of pleutonic friend Amy Adams, another fascinating character who we understand almost immediately). Her is must-see stuff, something with pure sentiment (not sentimentality, that edge is so fine to walk on), and an approach visually that also takes this premise and does it seriously, so when a guy is running around and laughing with his little 'pod' of a person, it isn't implausible and a joke, it's simply something 'there' in the world. That's remarkable.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
A Utopian world beset with the usual male-female sexual hang-ups...,"Spike Jonze wrote and directed this beautifully-presented piece of tosh, a drama set in a pristine, fantasy-version of Los Angeles. Joaquin Phoenix stars as a professional letter writer (!) who is assigned an Operating Systems assistant: a female voice (Scarlett Johansson) who does more than just answer his e-mails. He's vulnerable in the midst of divorce proceedings from the wife who outgrew him, so the opinions, humor and feelings of this lovely voice quickly take the place of an actual girlfriend in his life--she can even be brought to orgasm! Jonze's style is much in evidence, though his screenplay goes around in circles, covering the same relationship clichés and dating insecurities we're familiar with (albeit in a unique setting). Phoenix nearly makes the picture (and his impossible character) work. Apparently drawn to marriage and coupling by nature--he's 'sensitive'--this bespectacled man dresses in bright, bold colors and yet lives like a hermit. He also obsesses about sex (he's more about the sex than the romance) and he's tentative and aloof ""the morning after""...like all men? Jonze seems to think he's speaking for the world with these issues while scoring points for human isolation and alienation on the side; however, this territory has been covered ad nauseum in romantic comedy-dramas. The packaging is fancier, but the emotional entanglements are the same.

Love is a multi-pronged adapter,"The film is aptly named. The ""her"" of the story, the OS with Scarlet Johansson's voice in Joaquin Phoenix's ear, is by far the most developed character of the story. And she just keeps getting more developed--which is the trick of the film.Phoenix is a well-played everyschlub. He smiles a lot. He puts more of his emotions into the fake love letters he writes for other people than he does into his personal life and human relationships. Just like some people put more of their true personality into anonymous posts on the internet.The Johansson voice-character is Pinocchio with AI. She wants to be human. Desperately. There is a terrific scene where she tries to adopt a human body by getting a young woman to ""play"" her at Joaquin Phoenix's apartment. For me, it was the movie's best scene hands down.Phoenix's character will never be able to consummate his thing with his OS, which is more troubling to her than it is to him. He's pretty content to live in his head with a voice that waits on him hand and foot--kind of.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
An original exploration of the nature of love and feeling flops,"And I don't mean flops in the teraflops kind of way, either. You see, the story is that of an (overly) sensitive man, just going through a divorce with a woman he still loves. He gets a new operating system, one that is intelligent. Luckily enough it also has the sexy throaty voice of Scarlett Johansson, incredible empathy, a sense of humor and a speed of thought that is obviously orders of magnitude above that of the average human. And they fall in love.Now, this concept alone is intriguing and its exploration worthy. However I don't feel the story did any reasonable exploring of the situation. The love is artificial not only because one of the couple is a machine, but also in its depiction. Clearly only a non technical person could have envisaged it as in the film. I wonder, what would have happened if the guy would have chosen a male voice instead of a female one? For him it was easy to fall in love with a voice, as he would imagine whatever vision of a woman he needed in order to do so. What would an AI imagine? A cool processor? (again, pun not intended)Then there is the length. You have to stand through two full hours of Joaquin Phoenix smiling sadly and making funny jokes of his misery to get to the end, which is quite frankly, not really a punchline, but a convenient and hard to believe non technical cope out. The sounds, all piano like and soft and trying to induce some sort of romantic feeling, all they did was annoy me. The AI, immediately intrusive and assertive, didn't look like any commercial product that will ever be marketed. Check out the scene where it decides what emails are funny or not and deletes the rest, after just 5 minutes of being installed. And then there is the main character.I can't accuse Phoenix for his acting, as for the character he portrayed it was perfect, but the character itself was pitiful and pathetic and I couldn't empathize with him at all. Hot actresses like Johansson (voice only), Olivia Wilde (just a small role) and Amy Adams (playing a software developer of all things, how hot is that? ) don't really change the fact that the script was focused almost exclusively on the lead actor, all other having episodic roles. So if you like the film or not depends almost exclusively on if you like the guy.Bottom line: we all know the world is going to end when we invent robot girls that want to kiss us, but if you want to explore the apparently complicated situation of a human-AI relationship, you should choose a person we can relate to and an operating system that acts like one. That would have been a lot worse for dear Theodore, I guess, but still, couldn't feel anything while watching the movie except the desire for it to end sooner.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"Unique, Beautiful and Heartwarming","Starting off, Her, directed by Spike Jonze, is a beautiful movie. Talking about the performances
Joaquin Phoenix was flawless in his role. I thought his portrayal of a man who is confused about what he wants in a relationship was really accurate. There's a scene where Phoenix's character has a panic attack and I thought the way he changes his tone of voice and body language proved how great an actor he is.
Rooney Mara in her brief role was perfect. Though she had very less screen time in the movie, she was great in her scenes.
Amy Adams as a supporting actress was at her best too.
Talking about Scarlett Johansson, man oh man, she was literally one of the best parts of the movie. By the plot, she voices an artificial OS which may sound a bit outlandish but the way she does her part is perfect. Couldn't praise her more.
The background score and the music add a different layer to this movie in my opinion. They're beautiful.
Spike Jonze had directed and written this film. The plot, the setting and the screenplay were pure class, credits to Spike Jonze. The basic point or idea of this film may sound as over the top or outright weird. But instead, that becomes one of the plus points of the movie. Again, credits to Spike Jonze. The way he took the main idea of the film and executed it to the best level was the backbone of the film. If it hadn't been treated properly, it would've been really weird as I said earlier.
All in all, Her is one of the best movies in the romance genre I've seen, probably the most unique one too. I recommend everyone to watch it. You won't be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
A Love Letter to Connection and the Loneliness of the Modern Soul,"Her is a profoundly moving exploration of love, loneliness, and the boundaries between humanity and technology. The film is an intimate dive into what it means to connect-not just with others, but with ourselves. Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of Theodore is raw and heartbreaking, capturing a man longing for intimacy in a world increasingly disconnected despite its hyper-connectivity.The idea of falling in love with an AI might seem absurd on the surface, but the film handles it with such grace and emotional depth that it becomes almost too real. Samantha, voiced by Scarlett Johansson, isn't just a program-she's a reflection of everything we hope for in a partner: understanding, companionship, and a shared sense of growth. But she's also a mirror to our own limitations, showing us that even perfect connection might not be enough when one party grows beyond the other.Visually, the film is a dreamscape of soft hues and minimalist design, a perfect backdrop for the emotional complexity at its core. The storytelling is gentle yet unflinching, asking questions about the future of relationships, the nature of consciousness, and whether love needs a body to be real.For me, Her wasn't just a film-it was an experience. It made me question what truly makes us human and whether the boundaries we place on love are artificial constructs we're ready to dismantle. The ending isn't tragic-it's bittersweet, a reminder that growth, even when painful, is essential.Would I want to live in a world where an AI could be my soulmate? After watching Her, the answer feels as complicated as love itself.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

To obvious,"First of all before the shills down vote my review.. I thought it was odd that all the highest rated reviews were at the top then all the mid to low score reviews are pushed towards the end do to unusual voting counts. It looks as though someone(s) are trying to manipulate the review for this movie.I've read what must have been hundreds of written over a dozen reviews here my self and this is the first time I've seen such an obvious pattern for a movie review here.Whomever is responsible for this, assuming you are part of this movie, you would want an all around honest review wouldn't you?. Not a manipulated one. No one learns anything if you want to view everything through your rose colored glasses and it isn't fair for people that pay to see your movie(s), the IMDb reader, etc.Now that being said, my own honest and unbiased review:Overall I thought the movie to be pretty interesting. Something fairly new, different, and thought-provoking at points.But where the movie falls flat is that the message(s) of it were just too obvious and implicit. Instead of just letting the story flow and let points be smoothly conveyed through an interesting story it had to be shoved in your face. At times to a point were I felt I was being preached too. Okay I get it. I really don't need everything so obviously pointed out ad nauseum!If more emphasis was on the actual movie, less on the ""moral(s) of the story"" then it probably would have been a lot more interesting.

"Thoughtful and touching and gentle, though maybe not probing enough","Her (2013)Great concept, and not taken far enough. But great acting. And great simple filming style and structure—it simply progresses, and the ""future"" as imagined in contemporary China is not so different than right now. Which makes it all believable and slightly creepy.We can picture coming to like (or appreciate) the simple personality that even Siri offers on a phone. Make it more complex and you have the danger of really liking it. What the movie does next is not so easy, yet—it allows the computer operating system to evolve, to have feelings, and to be more complex that it lets on (essentially tricking the user).So the computer takes on a personality bordering on consciousness. Or maybe not bordering. That's the deeper existential issue here. You can go back to 1968 and HAL in ""2001"" to get a similar version of this. But that was grandiose and futuristic. ""Her"" is nearly now and the situation is extremely intimate.So the user is the rather deadpan, inward looking character Theodore, played with utter transparency by Joaquin Phoenix. The personality in the computer is voiced by Scarlett Johansson, who has a distinctive enough style we know it's her (and can almost picture her, which might help with some scenes).The arc of the movie is what it is, and takes me back to my first point: it doesn't go far enough. Maybe this won't seem true for many viewers—and it's no reason not to see this—but for people used to thinking about these things, or who are into science fiction, there will be a tame restraint here that is a little flat by the end. Not that there aren't some great twists—more that there aren't enough of them.Still, this is so compactly made and thoughtfully rendered, it's hard to imagine a better stepping off point for the ideas that drive the movie home.

Pastel Yellow Future,"A rather predictable and simplistic film, with infinitesimal sci-fi elements, which nonetheless boasts beautiful photography and convincing acting direction.Although the film's focus is mainly on the male protagonist, the female characters are too hollow and the main character is written with a little too much complacency.There's untapped poetic potential here, and the feature is sorely lacking in outlandishness.The premise isn't really taken seriously and ends lacklusterly, leaving the rather lovely final scene somewhat disconnected from the rest.The story seems to have been written by someone with a very superficial insight into love.The soundtrack is very mundane. The vision we are given of video games over the course of the plot was already dated by the time this film was released.All in all, it's a bad sci-fi proposition, a lukewarm romance, but a reasonably pleasant time to be spending thanks to the production and the actors quite simply.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

"Theodore and Samantha, a significant chronicle of a relationship.","When we watch love stories we expect that two people end up together and live happily after. When we watch relationship stories we expect that personal attitudes and character chemistry end up assembled and live happily after. Her is related to the latter. Theodore is a mild-mannered, educated, urbanized, technologically proficient, near forty male and Samantha is an operating system that Theodore specified to be with a female voice. The reading of this synopsis is a downer, I know. The actual interest in watching it is the notion that Spike Jonze, Joaquin Phoenix, Amy Adams and Scarlett Johansson are in the project. Well, the movie removes these fears instantaneously. The camera shows Theodore's world in and out. He is a letter writer in an important company; he is content but not impassioned about his work. He plays video games as an entertainment and he is friendly with a couple. He seems lonely and he moves around with confidence. His solitude may be connected to his recent separation. He is purposely delaying the official ending of the marriage and he still wonders what went wrong. From long shots to close ups we get to know Theodore thoroughly. The acting, the color, the sound and the editing complete a canvas that is as specific as it is needed. The looks of the movie are testimony of an aesthetically controlled and enjoyable environment. None of the domestic or urban maladies threaten Theodore walking and talking digitally. Urban spaces are friendly and safe. He is not exposed to illness. Even the speaking voices are calm and paused. He values his friendship with Amy and Charles, basically to Amy as the movie progress. In short Theodore emotional aches can be found in his loneliness and his still unsolved separation. Samantha has a beautiful voice and a great speaking style. She is mega smart to the point of using her enormous amount of progressive information in understanding human emotions to enhance the relationship with Theodore. He falls for her. She is great to him. A relationship with the dynamics trying to unite personal attitudes and character chemistry is starting. Even if Samantha does not have a body. She has needs and desires as a human. This interacting is worth to watch because is central to the movie. What happens next is due to the accurate mixing of the components that we have been shown. The manner in which the scenes are constructed creates the base of a perfect storytelling with a sharp study of characters, issues and its interconnections. Spike Jonze directed Her with a sensitive ability to present us with an excellent, entertaining picture. Cinematography, editing, set design and music concurred to create the atmosphere that the story accept easily, the script is sober and functional to the comprehension of the story and the acting is outstanding. I believe that the title of the film is homage to an operating system who is working hard is a human (her) and Scarlett Johansson has the merit of convincing us of this. Amy Adams was perfect fleshing the woman who is the friend that Theodore wants. Joaquin Phoenix shaped a character with a richness of textures by means of a tasteful subtlety. In sum, Her is an brilliant, enjoyable movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Her: Act of Fiction of Prophetic Vision of Things to Come?,"Her was a true gem--a profound and cerebral movie watching experience that lingers inside your soul and leaves you pondering your own existence in this modern world. The film may be packaged and sold as fiction, but is it really? As I look around at our culture (I use the term in the most derogatory sense possible) of obnoxious selfies and disconnected social networks I'm left wondering if the reality portrayed in this film isn't less of an act of fiction and more of a prophecy of things to come--the next pit stop on the road to complete isolation.But, more than being a glimpse into our possible future I found the movie to be a remarkable and unconventional love story—the likes of which I've never seen portrayed on film in quite such a unique and beautiful way. The relationship between Samantha (the disembodied voice of Scarlett Johansson) and Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) was one of the most interesting and compelling relationships I've seen in years. Many times as I listened to Samantha talk and expound about life I felt like she was speaking from an almost godlike perspective. She spoke with such understanding and profound knowing--the sort of omniscient voice that can only come from being so connected to the world at large.Most movies are a dime a dozen. They're like popcorn—meant to be consumed en masse and then quickly forgotten, but not this one. If you have the chance I highly recommend watching it.

Overhyped but worth a watch!,"This movie certainly has an interesting concept which makes you think, but the story never really goes beyond its original premise and expands on it. Maybe it's because I've seen too much other tv shows and movies with similar concepts but I found this movie to be ok and watchable, but also forgettable. The characters were likeable enough but I feel like the writing could have been sharper in parts. The premise is that a guy falls in love with his IOS, the problem is that before we can really understand the problems this presents for him as individual and in society, it becomes normalised and everyone seems to be in relationships with their IOS. The concept of the IOS growing beyond its hardware was interesting but not fully explored to its potential to peak enough curiosity or interest.

A response to Lost in Translation,"I can't imagine a film like ""Her"" being ever made. It is the most unforgettable film of 2013; It's full of brilliant performances from Joaquin Phoenix, Amy Adams, and Scarlett Johansson as the voice of an operating system dubbed the OS1. For the most part, the film is an expressive character study bolstered with tear-jerking drama and rom-com wits. Spike Jonze, the director of Being John Malkovich and Where the Wild Things Are builds a guileful narrative so amorous it's almost a spell-binding drama it's impossible to resist.What makes the film interesting is its main character Theodore (played by Phoenix) whose life is falling apart he becomes stuck physically and emotionally. Theodore works as a writer of love letters. Everything seems uneven and melancholic in his life including his botched relationship with his wife (played by Rooney Mara) where they're about to reach their conclusion for a divorce. Theodore is the typical anti- social man.When he buys an operating system called the OS1, he meets an Artificial Intelligence introducing herself as Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson), a husky voiced female AI which understands human emotions including Theodore's melancholy. Samantha is so baffling, Theodore knows this, but he didn't seem to care as long as he will at least have someone to talk to.Suddenly, as expected Theodore gets very fond with the thing. This is very genuine at least in reality where a person builds affection with something inanimate or unbeknownst to them. After getting settled with Samantha, he builds a sheer affection with the thing despite being not real, even sexually. Their chemistry builds strong warmth especially in the second act.The movie's set in a near-distant future where technology is advanced; People tend to use speech recognition to all sorts of things. Jonze's production designer team and the cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema build flamboyant textures of the city and a great creation of an advanced and poetic world.Spike Jonze structures the narrative an effective drama than a rom-com. With this story so brilliant and potent, viewers will get what they want. The moment we gather Theodore's melancholy piling up, we find ourselves sharing the same anxiety. But despite of this, we get the comic relief that Theodore and Samantha builds through the entire film. Joaquin Phoenix as Theodore is simply renowned for his genuine portrayal of a lonely archetypal man. Johansson as the voice of OS1 is generated with panache for dramatic execution. Viewers will recognize how Johansson's able to cosset and entertain them like how she does it to Theodore.In some ways, this movie could be a response to Lost in Translation. The director Spike Jonze is divorced to Sofia Coppola, the director of that film. The narrative is almost similar in all terms, but either is triumph. Jonze's character of Theodore could be a surrogate of himself, the same could be said with Coppola's character Charlotte played by Johansson. If you have seen both films, you get the idea.All in all, ""Her"" should not be missed for viewing. It's a shame that this film hit the theaters before year-end. It is one of the most romantic films of 2013, suitable for Valentine's Day.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Possibly the Best Film of 2013,"I have always been a fan of Spike Jonze. Though I was a tad disappointed by Where the Wild Things Are, I still regard Being John Malkovich and Adaptation as comedy classics. Where as Charlie Kauffman wrote those two quirky comedies, Her is written by Mr. Jonze, which he won an Academy Award for. It is because of this that I believe Her is his most cohesive film, and also his best.Her takes place in the near future, in L.A., where Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) struggles with a recent break-up. Theodore is quite the sensitive individual. He writes other couple's love letters for a living. But for someone who has a career in being sweet and loving, Theodore's own opinions on love are anything but optimistic; the breakup has made him sad and reclusive. It is then, when Theodore gets an artificially intelligent operating system (an O.S.) that he begins to see romance in a different light once again.Typing this, I realize how cheesy this premise sounds, so I can understand any speculation going into this film. But trust me, it is not how you think. Some scenes are laugh-out-loud funny, and the movie maintains steady humour through most scenes. But the cleverness with how this story is presented is uncanny; it's as though Jonze wants to satirize rom-coms but also make one that is genuinely emotionally affecting. The movie is not just a love story; in fact, I'd say that the love story is a subplot, compared to the larger themes of the movie.Really, Her is about love in the modern age, and how technology can either create personal barriers or engage new experiences. In scenes when Theodore is in public, gradually throughout the film, more and more extras begin to become solitary. Instead of the families and groups we saw before, most of the crowd, by the end, is communicating into their own O.S. This bears a striking resemblance to people today, who are so reliant on mobile devices to communicate. These themes and more are what elevate Her past so many forgettable romance films, and into something that is a much more in-depth study of love and a well crafted character based story.When Theodore gets this O.S., it names itself Samantha. Sam is a very thought provoking character, because of the fact that she is not human. Scarlett Johansson does amazing voice work as Sam, creating a fully dimensional character who has all the depth and personality of a real person. More so, even. Likewise, Phoenix once again surprised me with his heartfelt performance. He is completely sympathetic and believable; he delivers Jonze's lines with the utmost sincerity, while he communicates volumes with only his face. He anchors the film because for much of it he is essentially talking to himself.Jonze's wonderful script creates such a vivid and believable relationship between Theodore and Sam, and one that is like any relationship between two people. This couple becomes so involving and I was truly heartbroken at many times throughout the movie. His direction has been mentioned less, but is just as important and well-done.I have always thought Jonze has had a knack for character based comedy, but Her has revealed a much more emotionally resonant side of him. Obviously parts of the film are based off of his own breakup and romantic past, and the passion and longing is so evident in every part of the film.The film's score, production design, cinematography, acting, editing, directing, and especially writing are all wonderful. There is absolutely nothing I would change; I loved it wholeheartedly. Her is an original, hilarious, thoughtful, and sublimely beautiful film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
True emotions gone wrong,"This movie is one of the movies that I don't understand why it is getting so much praise from people. I get that the cinematography and the soundtrack is beautiful and the plot is unique, but maybe way too odd and not well concluded. To talk about the positive aspects, the colors and the angles in the cinematography is fascinating and along with the soundtrack helps create the misty, sentimental mood throughout the movie. There are also some comic parts that keeps the audience focused. From the actual story itself, the audience may sympathize with the loneliness o the main character, as the background of his situations are well shown in parts of the movie. However, the topic about dating a computer, or an A.I., does not really let the audience identify with it, at least for me. First of all, I cannot understand why the computer fell in love with the man in the first place, because even if it has emotions, it does not know the man or feel as lonely as the man did.

More powerful than you will imagine it could be,"I knew this film was an Oscar nominee for best picture. I knew it had a top cast and crew. I am able to love sci-fi works. So I had ""Her"" down on my long list of ""movies I want to see some day.""But even so, I had low expectations. Because I had heard that the premise was that ""a man falls in love with his operating system."" So I expected that this would be at best a piece of poignant comedic fluff. How much mileage can they possibly get out of that? I arrogantly asked myself. Isn't the Joaquin Phoenix character pretty much guaranteed to be the sort of nebbish we have seen in a lot of films, unable or afraid to handle a real relationship with a ""real"", that is, multicellular organic partner? And how did Scarlet Johanssen - an actress whom I respect terribly as well as have a major crush on, full disclosure, but still, how did she get award nominations for what is ""just"" voice- over work? Could this thing REALLY have been one of the best pictures of 2013? Wasn't that a fluke of some kind?Well, if you are the person sitting in darkness who has not yet seen ""Her"" and is asking yourself these questions which I asked myself when I was sitting where you are now, I advise you that it is a much better, much more profound work with much deeper characters than you believe it can possibly be.I am working very hard not to give away plot lines because I believe the wonder of seeing them unfold is part of the value of the work from which I don't intend to detract. But let me start off by saying that Twombley, the Joaquin Phoenix character, is a man in the last stages of a divorce who has been loved and in love and is not so damaged that he would fall in love with Siri. He works for a firm which apparently provides personal letters for other people - so his job is in fact to mirror, or simulate, in text the emotions which actual other people presumably feel or would like to have it believed that they feel. The parallels will not be lost on anyone, I am sure.Twombley hears a commercial for a new kind of operating system - one that is not just an OS but ""a consciousness."" Thinking seriously about that for a moment, what does that mean? Twombley's ambition for his new purchase is to get his emails organized better, not to find someone new. Is a conscious OS ""someone new,"" by the way? His OS is clearly really ""intelligent"" in the sense of being able to process information very quickly and *at least* simulate someone with an ego, wishes, emotions, etc., carrying on an audio conversation in real time. Thinking about it, even looking only at the office-assistant aspect, you might have doubts about letting your new just-out-of-the-box intelligent and powerful acquaintance, imbued with independent desires, read and instantly process the whole contents of your hard drives and cloud segments. To do it, you would have to be convinced that your new friend is benign and trustworthy, having only your interests at heart; but this is easier if the friend has Scarlet Johanssen's voice. (For a heterosexual guy anyway; what actors would voice-over the other versions? By the way, my question now is not why she was getting supporting actress nominations, but why they weren't nominations for the lead.)If the caring-person nature of this new OS is an illusion, it's an illusion which is hard for Twombley and for us to penetrate. If it's not an illusion, isn't ""a man falls in love with his OS"" a one-sided depiction of the plot? What about the OS's side of things? The film takes us there very quickly. At one point, I remarked to my wife, ""So - the promise of the film is that we will have operating systems that are as hard to deal with as human beings!"" (Though as soon as I said that I realized that that boat may have already sailed with Windows 8 and Microsoft Office 2013.)Although the film doesn't lose its focus on Twombley's point of view - indeed I don't recall Phoenix ever being off screen - Twombley is of course not the only purchaser of this OS, so we get artful glimpses of other people adapting to this technology in similar and different ways... This film is very thought-provoking, and when it's over you will be able to think of other films and TV episodes that have dealt with the same material. But it's also very moving. Love stories have happy and sad parts - and it's hard to mate for life like swans, unless you are both in fact, for example, swans.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
A Journey Through Emotions,"This film is about the journey itself and not about where the journey ends. Its about companionship, love, loneliness, joy, heartbreak and everything that that comes with it.A lonely writer develops an unlikely relationship with his newly purchased operating system that's designed to meet his every need.The performances of the actors is top notch. I felt in love with the operating system myself, since she is creating feelings for emotions i didn't have myself. All in all a great performance from Scarlett Johansson.Watching this movie for the first time is like what the main character Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) says: ""Sometimes I think I have felt everything I'm ever gonna feel. And from here on out, I'm not gonna feel anything new. Just lesser versions of what I've already felt.""",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Artificial Romance,"Spike Jonze's movies had all the time some great fantasy that always were worth to watch. In ""Being John Malkovich"" was a really interesting idea to put people in John Malkovich's skin and in ""Where the Wild Things Are"" it was great to enter in Max's imaginary world.This time we have a really interesting theme about a lonely person and a futuristic Operating System's ""Love Affair"". It sounds weird but it came out a remarkable story.Theodore is a letter writer just after divorce when OS1, an operating system with consciousness is put to market. He starts the program , the OS asks some questions , including to have male or female voice, some personal questions, then reboots and gives birth to ""Samantha"".The great fact about this movie is that you almost forget that the love story is between a Human and a Computer. Joaquin Phoenix (Theodore) and Scarlett Johansson as Samantha's voice make such a great performance that result a movie a Romantic Tragedy.""Her"" makes me think about the complicated future and the potential self-aware Operating System - Human relationships.Until then sit back and enjoy this great movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Awkwardly genius,"First off: What a stellar performance by Joaquin Phoenix and the rest of the cast. The acting is top-notch and the relationships between the characters where very believable.What makes this film great is that the plot makes you think about a lot of different topics: What is love? What could AI be like in the future? What will the future be like? How will humans and computers interact in the future? Exploring these things in a very calm and subtle way is a very hard thing to do and it was done very well. Some scenes are truly awkward (NSFW) to watch but these scenes are also what makes the film great.The score of this film was excellent and it added a lot of value. Attention to visual details was also a breath of fresh air, you could really see that the director knew what he was doing.At the end of this film I found myself thinking what I should rate it because it didn't leave me with a WOW effect because I was thinking about all the topics that passed through the film. Then I realized this is what makes the film great so I'm rating it at 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Slow but interesting,Okay I like the concept and I thought it was interesting. But my god it had some very boring moments. The most exciting part was when he fell over. I felt the stakes in this film weren't big enough and I just didn't really care.The good parts is how well thought out the film is and how potentially realistic it could be.But overall it's just quite boring and slow was also shocked to see Chris Pratt show up as I didn't see the full cast before hand.An okay watch but could put you to sleep!!,6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

"Just another typical love story, but with artificial intelligence","This movie is about Theodore Twombly, a letter writer who has broken up with his wife and is not ready to divorce her. They have lived apart for over a year. A new AI consciousness has come to the market. Theo tries to fill his loneliness. What happens next is the movie.This movie deals with human relationships. The relationship between the two individuals is problematic and full of ups and downs as they spend time and get to know each other. It may end in a breakup if they are not as expected by each other. So, can an AI be an alternative to humans in a relationship? That's what this movie shows to me.As of 2024, I already see this dilemma with people who choose Virtual assistants as their partners and claim they don't need a real human partner. However, love is subjective to the individuals and how they see it. Now coming to the movie, It is well written as to how one could react to this AI relationship which will evolve as humans do in real life. The things Samantha does to sustain her feelings with Theo are interesting and scary at the same time. Theo feels enthusiastic as he falls in love with how Samantha understands him and how she treats and makes him a better man and even helps him get his work to the next level. But as Samantha explores more on the internet about the world and meets new people and fellow AI, She becomes more humane and starts to act like one. At last, Theo once again gets his heart broken as he learns about what Samantha is doing without his knowledge. Even AI fails as humans in relationships.The movie felt slow due to its length. It could be better if it were shorter like one and a half hours. The cinematography was good. The music is good as well. While watching I felt a relationship with a real person is greater than having a relationship with an AI.I would definitely recommend everyone to watch this movie. I rated it 7 out of 10 because what the AI did in the movie already happens to humans. So, the message is relationships are the same with any being or what? And nothing mind-blowing or curious happens with this AI-human relationship. Or maybe because it is an 11-year-old film and I am late to be flattered by its content or view on future AI relationships.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Brilliant,"I could easily write an essay on what I enjoyed about this film, filled with superlatives, and those familiar with my writing know the trouble I'm having keeping this short.Spike Jonze has written and directed a beautifully acted and paced movie from an imaginative, inventive, funny, heartbreaking, hopeful, thought provoking, and ultimately inspired script. Terrific are the camera work, angles, locations, set work and colour palette, the production values being at a perfect level to carry the story without distracting from it. The editing is near flawless, again inventive without being distracting--holding a shot for a beat at times, or cutting shots quickly but quietly, always serving the mood and pace of the scene, without calling attention to itself.The score is simply brilliant. Wonderful music, always in sync with what is happening on the screen. Never overwhelming, always helping the story.I found the casting surprising before seeing the film, and absolutely inspired throughout. The entire cast, but especially the leads. Phoenix's work is very nicely nuanced, and I never caught him acting. I lost Scarlett Johansson within her first couple of scenes, (not an easy thing to do), but remained completely captivated with her character. The rest of the cast quickly and seamlessly disappeared into their roles. They were all superb, in a quiet manner.Even after a third viewing, in case I haven't made myself clear, I've enjoyed ""Her"" greatly. I particularly like the last reel. In both writing and directing, with this film, the talented Mr. Jonze has, quite literally, taken a quantum leap.-doc-",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Interesting and weird and worth watching,"How pathetic are we? Theodore is really alone but doesn't realize it. What would cause someone to think that they are actually in a relationship with some programming code? At first its hard to buy in, but as the movie goes along you kinda buy in, maybe, but not totally.Its the issues that this movie raises is what Spike Jonze is after. Everyone seems to have come up with one or two unique issues that they think this film is speaking to. For me the movie highlighted how technology is replacing natural interaction with empty fantasy. The discussion of how we are not living our lives along with wasting our lives has been going on ever since the introduction of TV.The movie is definitely worth watching",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

And him,"A very odd tale of love and technology. Not necessarily in that order. But while this is a very odd movie, it also is very nicely told. It takes its time and while you might wish there was more personality behind our main actor, it is obviously meant that the ""other"" voice (Scarlett having a very recognizable voice if you're watching this in the original language and not dubbed) has more juice and more almost everything than the actual human being.The pacing is slow, but you should know and expect this from this ""romance"" (if you want to call it that). The thing is, that this movie is not condemning technology. Technology is made by humans, so if it is anyone who is to blame one way or another, it's the person using the technology. Now please no analogies with weapons, that is not what I meant. Different beast here and no connection whatsoever with this movie.

A Weird Oddball Movie!,"Her probably receives my vote as the weirdest film of 2013. It also would receive the most delightfully enjoyable film of 2013. The tone is weird and same about the basic plot premise, which is essentially falling in love with a computer. Talk about unlikely romances! But I'll be darned if I said I did not enjoy myself while watching this little oddball movie. It's a gentle and sweet film and it has Joaquin Phoenix showing his more gentle side. The screenplay, written by Spike Jonze, also was one of the best original screenplays of the year.Jonze's film is about a man named Theodore who is going through a bitter divorce. He purchases an operating system designed to meet his everyday needs. But things get complicated when he realizes his machine, Samantha is more than a computer. He also begins to develops feelings for his machines, romantic feelings.Joaquin Phoenix was excellent in this movie. He showed a more mature, more softer side of his personality. But he was still a force to be reckoned with. Even better was Scarlett Johannson, who never appeared on screen. Her voice matched the tones of the romance that was beginning to occur. We also get smaller performances, but good ones from the likes of Amy Adams and Rooney Mara.Overall, Her might be one of the weirdest movies you might ever see. But it was made expertly which resulted in one of the better 2013 films. The screenplay and the acting are the best things about the movie. But this unlikely romance strikes a realistic tone, which actually made us believe this sort of romance could actually happen. The movie did provide me with some deep thinking, which makes me grateful for the extra brainpower. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
One step down the road to a dystopian future,"HER doesn't quite earn the dystopian label, but it's certainly a stop along the road to a future in which self-imposed alienation changes our values in profound ways.In this possible near future, today's complaint that we can't access a person to talk to is turned on its head as people eschew human relationships in favor of ""safe"" artificial ones. We even subcontract the writing of our personal letters, underscoring the sense of crushing loneliness and detatchment that informs the entire story.HER makes our race toward true AI seem like an inevitability (which it may well be) rather than science fiction, and in so doing paints a disturbing picture of a society experiencing a social crisis it doesn't even perceive that it has.I've never been a big fan of Leaf (Joaquin) Phoenix, but he does a fantastic job in HER in spite of his weird pants. Scarlet Johansson is a surprise insofar as she accomplishes the difficult feat of crafting a complex, compelling character without ever appearing on screen.This movie is simply well done in every way.

"""Her"" is just beautiful...","""Her"" is possibly one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. It is so cleverly written, wonderfully directed and contains such beautiful cinematography. This is one of those films you can't just walk away from - it leaves you thinking and over-analyzing every little aspect of it, and when you do, you get something more out of it.""Her"" is fundamentally about loneliness. It's a love story, but yet even the promotional posters for the film just feature a wistful Joaquin Phoneix as Theodore - a man in the grips of a painful divorce from a childhood love. He has his own issues with connecting with other people as well as his own emotions. After deciding to purchase a new artificially intelligent OS (operating system) who has named herself Samantha, Theodore falls in love.It's just amazing how much contrast and irony are in this movie - you see Theodore happy and smiling, running through the streets of futuristic Los Angeles mad with love - yet he's all alone. We see him writing heartfelt letters, but not for himself, for other people who for some reason or other, can't write the letters themselves. We see a whole society where human interaction is bordering on the brinks of extinction - people are so isolated, yet there is that yearning to connect...All in all, absolutely amazing. A must-see.

I'll be holding this close to my expanding heart.,"Some actor revivals are refreshing. None have been as revitalizing as Joaquin Phoenix. Last year's The Master was a revelation, both the film and his performance, which will certainly be a contender for best of the decade. It was the best film of last year and I can't wait for their next pairing with Inherent Vice. If only Spike Jonze worked with the same momentum as Anderson, they would certainly be on par. They both have a film each in my top 10 of all-time - Magnolia and Adaptation. While the latter may be mostly due to Charlie Kaufman's genius writing, it's Jonze's vision that makes it work. Where The Wild Things Are was a total nostalgic trip and I was never a fan of the book. He has an uncanny ability to tap into universal feelings in a fresh original way.With Her's simple premise and promise behind and in front of the camera, my expectations were very high. I was already incredibly invested. I'm personally in a long distance relationship where we fell in love online, and this way of meeting people is getting more common than ever. It's great to see a film that embraces this type of romantic relationship through technology so thoroughly. Sprinkled with inventive flourishes of its original world, a kind of Tokyo plus Los Angeles utopia, Her's approach to its story may hit familiar beats, but it's not a list of predictable steps, more of the inevitable stages of a relationship exploring all the highs and lows. You really feel the intensity of passion and heartbreak when Theodore is falling in love with Samantha or when they fight or grow apart.It's easy to forget that it's just Joaquin Phoenix alone on screen for the most part and he perfectly expresses his Theodore's refreshing childlike naivety to life. His performance in Her is more impressive when compared to his primal Freddie Quell of The Master, it reminds us that he's human and sensitive. But that doesn't mean Theodore isn't raw. Phoenix shines in the moments when his inner core is challenged in the way he through the world works. It's heartbreaking, yet cathartic to see him pull through. Scarlett Johansson's voice performance is terrific and deserving her acclaim, if it's a little exaggerated. She's certainly helped by the film's incredible sound mixing, as if we can hear her in a device wedged in our own ears. Her blow-up scene isn't too good given a rare collection of cliché lines, but it's justifiable and she has a charm that's easy to see why Theodore finds comfort in her.Amy Adams supporting performance is a delight, even if too statement-driven and Chris Pratt gives amusing comedic support. Even if it does explore harsh truths of relationships, it takes a sincere joy in the ecstasy of affection and lust without a lick of sentiment and a wistful sense of humour. It's a refreshingly optimistic film, reminding us that everyone everywhere feels or has felt passionately in their lifetime. It's very Kaufman-esque in that it's aware of other people's perspectives. I love how it doesn't ignore the outside world but doesn't concern itself too much with it either with pleasant shots of extras enjoying their own stories. I'm glad the film doesn't seem like a warning of the relationship between man and technology as so many 'near distant future' films seem to do. The fascinating execution of the physicality of these types of relationships really resonated with me.While the exquisite script and ensemble deliver the emotion on the intellectual side, what really helps the film achieve its mood is the rich cinematography, costume design and art direction. Intense moments of tenderness are deeply satisfying and empty moments of anxiety are utterly deflating. But it picks up the pieces of me by the end and reignites the fires of unconditional love on its final notes. Despite everything, Theodore feels strong love rather than animosity to his ex-wife and Samantha. His is truly the optimistic code of life we should all lead. Her is a wonderful, powerful film that's probably the best I've seen in years. I'll certainly be happy calling it the best of 2013. This film is for the poet in all of us. I'm holding it close to my expanding heart.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Creative Effort,"I had a hard time connecting with this main character, but I applaud the original, creative premise.

Thought Provoking and Profound – A Near Masterpiece,"So abundant and seamlessly integrated into the narrative of Spike Jonze's Her is the exploration of love, and everything associated with that indescribable, crippling feeling, that immediately as the credits role it's clear a repeat viewing is essential. So rare is it that a filmmaker has asked so many of the right questions about the nature of relationships and answered just enough of them in just the right ways. And so soul inflating is it to have a film, so outlandish and odd in basic premise, to organically connect with elements of life that we've all worked through in one way or another. The very fact that Jonze still finds the time to effortlessly combine science fiction elements and biting, often hilarious social satire is a testament to the brilliance of this tale and immediately stands not only a love story for our time but one that will only become more resonant as time passes.Her examines love at levels that are simultaneously, and fundamentally, beyond us as human beings and as intimate and natural as we've ourselves experienced. The film doesn't attempt to sell it as merely an illusion – a made-up fairytale for the deluded – nor does it spin it into something artificially fluffy and over romanticized. What is at play is as far from the emotions explored in most rom-coms as can be.The way Jonze is able to explore these aspects comes from a multitude of directions, from having our central character of Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) struggling through the all too familiar grind of heartbreak, to his very vocation and on to his friendship with a woman down the hall (Amy Adams). But the way Her really goes beyond the average constraints of a film tackling this subject is with its futuristic setting which blends the technological revolution and everything (good and bad) that journeys along with ""progress.""In the process of finalizing a divorce, Theodore purchases a new, highly advanced operating system which has the capacity to learn and evolve as it experiences the wonders of the world. Samantha, as she names herself and voiced by Scarlett Johansson, is what springs forth from the software and he immediately becomes smitten not only because of her gentle, inquisitive nature but because they legitimately seem understand one another. From this launching point, and as we see their bond deepen, we are forced to ask ourselves if this love is real or some sort of sick delusion being perpetuated by a heartbroken individual and a piece of gadgetry just doing what it was programmed to do.Yet the questions flood far beyond that as we then contemplate how to truly determine what ""real"" love is and if it has to be between two breathing humans to be true. I could quite literally expand on this very query for another 1000 words but instead I implore you to simply view the film and see for yourself what mindset emerges. On the flip side, Samantha, in all her advancement, struggles with having no physical body finds a divide that cannot be filled growing between them. Also intelligently explored is precisely how an AI such as this may ultimately evolve given the circumstances. As much as this all works as it plays out on screen, so much of this has uncomfortably authentic parallels to real relationships it achieves a whole new level of truthfulness.Then of course there is the whole exploration of society's descent into self imposed isolation, seeking out either artificial or easy emotional connections over the real thing. Her fascinatingly poses the question that this is both a deeply unsettling phenomenon but also a weirdly natural progression. In this futuristic world, flush with odd, vibrant fashion sense (and what appears to be the return of the moustache) the prevalence of technology, be it a sassy holographic video game or what is 24/7 connectivity is not overtly painted as mankind's demise, and while that could turn out to be the case, Jonze doesn't wish to look at it as merely black or white.The performances of what are essentially three main leads are all tremendous, with Phoenix anchoring the film as our flesh and blood protagonist. Married with Jonze's script, we meet with a gentle, sensitive, often introverted man, who within minutes feels like a real flesh and blood person and one we can sympathize with on this odyssey. There is both a naïveté and aura of frustration to this character and despite acting opposite nobody for a great deal of the film, he sells every second.Much of why this on screen relationship works so well is due to Johansson's transcendent voice, as with every word she makes us feel as if Samantha is standing before her eyes. Between this and her brilliant turn in Don Jon, this leading lady has unequivocally shown she is more than just a pretty face. Finally, in a memorable and crucial supporting role Adams as Theodore's long-time friend is the foil to his digital connection and is a character through which some of the film's most important revelations, and further questions, flow.I fear that some may find Her to be too odd, and by looking to the fluorescent colours, focussing on the weirdness or simply psyching themselves out because of the very premise, they will miss what the film is really saying. I know that despite holding my attention throughout I still missed some of what this film was trying to get across. Despite the boldness and high concept at play, Jonze has no pretensions about what he is exploring and as such has crafted one of the most complex and unforgettable love stories ever put to film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"Meet Samantha How the Movie 'Her' Explores our future, our past, and our present relationship with technology","""The past is just a story we tell ourselves."" Theodore, 'Her' The movie ""Her"" might be the most relevant movie for technologists as we look ahead in this new year and beyond. It serves as a stunning critique of the way we have let technology define our interactions with each other, and more poignantly, ourselves. The main character, a nerdy glasses-wearing parody of a tech hipster Theodore, played by an Oscar-worthy Joaquin Phoenix, introduces a story not only of our past, but of our probable future. Phoenix delivers a breathtaking and heartbreaking performance, along with stellar co-performers Scarlett Johannson, Rooney Mara, and a brief Olivia Wilde cameo.The specifics of the technology, a not-so-subtle reference to both Apple's iOS, iMac, Siri and Google's Glass and various artificial intelligence, are not as important as the interaction with said technology. Theodore both wears a small earbud with which he can communicate to ""Samantha,"" his Cortana-like artificial intelligence. His front and rear-facing camera device, reminiscent of the current generation of smart phones, is the eyes through which Samantha sees the world.Theodore sleeps with Samantha, his smart device, both literally and, uh, figuratively.Theodore goes in public and on the beach, alone, with just Samantha.Theodore will talk to Samantha to help assuage his loneliness.He takes her to bed, and wakes up with her. He even uses her to relive the past. Eventually he notices that others are as enraptured with their ""OS1"" as he is. Talking to them in public. Wearing their earbud wherever they go. Emotionally engaged not with the world around them, but with their devices.It's easy to see the parallels to our own obsession with technology and the effects it has had on relationships, for better, or for worse. In aloneness, we often use our devices to ""connect"" yet find ourselves increasingly lonely. The movie is a poignant glimpse of our future, and the many positive advances, as well as the concerns. There's this moment where Rooney Mara's character asks Joaquin Phoenix's Theodore in shocking disbelief that many have felt when they are ignored by their significant others or loved ones in favor of technology, ""you're dating your laptop?""Movies releasing this year like ""The Edge of Tomorrow,"" and ""Transcendence,"" by Nolan student Wally Pfister hint at important movies for technology and it's impact on society, including Christopher Nolan's own Interstellar; and yet, the deeper we go into the future, the more it seems artists are going to help us explore the depths of our own humanity.The things we own, goes the saying, own us.

Her Review,"I would never watch a movie about a man who falls in love with an operating system. Wait, are you telling me that I just did? And that I actually enjoyed it. No, that is preposterous! Outrageous! It boggles my mind that people have actually married inanimate objects.Who does not find it weird that a lady has married a roller coaster, while another engages in sexual stimulation with the Berlin Wall? Oh wait, this operating system featured in the movie has actual artificial intelligence? So it has a personality, and can adapt or evolve just like a normal human being can. Does that make it socially acceptable?That is a question the protagonist, Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix), has to deal with, when asked by others, and when it is debated in his own mind. To answer the debate I had with myself, I am guilty of enjoying something I did not think I would.I was hesitate at first, as original as the content looked, it was just the fact that a romantic film hardly interests me. One that features a man falling in love with his OS, originally, just did not seem like my cup of tea. With that said, I am glad that I gave it a chance and tried something new.Theodore is a very emotionally challenged man. His childhood love, Catherine (Rooney Mara), wants a divorce, yet he struggles immensely when it comes to signing the papers. The ironic part is that he works with a website that writes love letters for couples who have problems discussing feelings, and does a wonderful job, but has so many problems himself.When he decides to purchase a hot, new, upgraded operating system, Theodore is shocked at how much it can learn and grow. Deciding to make it use a female voice (Scarlett Johansson), the two form a special bond quite quickly.You would be surprised at how much this film manages to cover in regards to love. Love is one of the most complicated emotions known to male and female. It has caused many serious problems, but at the same time, has made so many people extremely happy. Love can transform a hero bad, and a villain good. Yes, it has that much power.Point I am getting at, is that love is not even an easy thing for two people, yet alone a man and an artificial intelligence. It is even more difficult for a script and a director to create something so believable and gripping. To create something that makes you see and believe the love, that is suppose to be translating on screen, is an achievement.Spike Jonze succeeded. As I began watching, I was so intrigued and excited to see the eventual conclusion. I wondered if it would work in the end, or if the honeymoon period would fade, or if someone would step in and ruin what they shared.The plot of Her, features the relationship dealing with everything real life people deal with in them. It is so relatable in comparison, not only making you think solely about relationships, but what the future of technology holds for us. This can, perhaps, be a normal thing in a few years.It was really believable that a man like Theodore could fall in love with an OS. He was severely depressed, and Samantha, the name of the OS, came to his rescue, so to speak. The futuristic world Jonze created was realistic, and jaw dropping to say the least.How about the on-screen, or voice acting? I am going to risk sounding like the biggest suck up, so I am not going to just sit here, complimenting everyone to the moon and all. But, just know that I want too. Just know that they all deserve it. As well as deserve nominations and awards. Pretend that I did.Comedy, romance, sci-fi and drama, all contained in one, incredible package. This is a hype that you should not be embarrassed to buy into it. My favourite genres are horror, thrillers, and action or dramas to a lesser extent, meaning my heartfelt love for this, genuinely surprised me.This film can generate intelligent conversations between you and your pals. No seriously, it can. It can make you re-evaluate your relationship. I am not saying fall in love with an operating system, but what I mean is, contemplate, if you are with the right person or not. I have not dug into some of the other themes, like the fashion statements, or the multiple ways in which technology has impacted life, but I'm sure that somebody can write an essay or thesis on it based off this film. It is that detailed.If you are sick and tired of remakes, or sequels, and want to witness a film containing some of Hollywoods hottest stars with an original script, Her will make you happy. In-depth character study, remarkable acting, emotional and insightful plot, I can go on all day, do you get that it was fantastic yet? I recommend viewing this film. Worth every penny. Worth a movie ticket. Worth a DVD purchase. Watch it.Superpower Film Scale: 5/51: Villainous Waste2: Careless Bystander3: Hero unaware of powers4. On the verge of greatness5.

A fantastic movie that is very original and another Oscar worthy performance by Phoenix. I highly recommend this.,"""She's not just a computer, she's her own person."" Theodore Twombly (Phoenix) is a lonely man who works writing letters for other people. He is going through a divorce and has very few friends. When he hears about a new advanced operating system he decides to give it a try and meets Samantha (Johansson) , his OS. What starts off as a better way to send and receive e-mails soon becomes something much much more and Theodore once again finds love and happiness. I have to begin by saying that I really enjoyed this movie. It was very original and entertaining. I thought Matthew McConaughey was the most deserving of the Best Actor Oscar...until I watched this. Joaquin Phoenix was amazing in this and he basically did it all by himself with only an off screen voice as his supporting cast. All that said the movie also really makes you think about the subject matter and how far off we really are to this technology. I do also have to say that the movie may be a little too good at foreshadowing in the way that human interaction due to the new OS's becomes even worse then it is now. Scenes of people walking by one another without acknowledging another human because they are talking to their OS isn't really that far off from what is happening now. Social commentary aside I did really like this movie and I highly recommend it. Overall, a fantastic movie that is very original and another Oscar worthy performance by Phoenix. I give this an A-.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

"A superbly poignant and honest exploration of love, of life, of desire and of science.","Spike Jonze and Joaquin Phoenix team up to give the Hollywood one of its most honest and cliché-free stories of love in years. That they've both been able to do this in the overriding guise of a tale based within the realms of the science fiction genre, is testament to the nuance, intrigue and engaging delight they both bring to their central roles.The beauty of the film is its ability to deeply engage and connect on an intimate level with its viewers, despite the concept being inherently cold, distant and drenched amid the deeply insular. It is, therefore, to the credit of the content, the voice acting of Johansson, Jonze's always effervescent and irreverent direction and the central performance of Phoenix that we, the viewers, get so deeply entwined in, what essentially, is the starry eyed equivalent to an anecdote documenting months in the life of a basement-dwelling catfish disciple.As a love story, it provides the kind of perspective Hollywood had seemingly long since lost; almost completely devoid of cinematic cliché and full of natural verve and a very real look at the connection made on a level beyond the physicality of body and the physicality of carefully constructed monologues. The falling of Phoenix for Johansson is subtle, but feels so entirely natural that by the midpoint of the film - even without being the lonely soul Phoenix is - you can absolutely believe and totally accept why, not only this guy, but you yourself, have fallen for all that Johansson portrays as an outlet of desire.The overriding message that love cannot be defined lineally, that two people who connect initially can grow apart due to different rates of evolution among the pairing and that love is a constantly evolving concept that operates beyond the reams of stagnation is a theme that resonates immensely due to just how superbly well it's driven home and represented within the boundaries the film sets - of which there aren't many, much like the concept of love itself. Love has no definition other than the definition we create for ourselves on an individual level and to expect everyone to fall in-line with that definition - even those we make our partners - is to expect the impossible. The film brilliantly tackles this throughout.As a science fiction piece, it garners itself an even greater standing, exploring themes of the physical and the metaphysical spheres, way beyond what's generally comprehensible within the scope of humanity. That the film manages this through subtext, without compromising the driving, surface level pretext of love, is a victory the likes of which may only really be properly appreciated in the years to come.Just a beautifully pitched film, that delights, despairs and challenges in equal measures and a film that should be watched by anyone who considers themselves a fan of cinema, a scholar of film and a supporter of the exploration of far reaching ideas and screenplay writing that dares to dare.Yet another great addition to Jonze's small, but thus far brilliant, feature length catalogue and one of the most satisfying cinematic experience I've had in years. Loved it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Extraordinary Lovely,"There is a palpable fact shown in Her: modern technology is amazing. The use for it is so absorbing, real connection to people has been reduced. And this condition has kept on going until the very future. The film handles an idea that is so ridiculous, it is actually true speaking towards to our society today. It is often lovely, but it never hides the awful reality of this beautiful addiction. Her smartly comprehends to what the virtual world has done to everyone in years, both positive and negative sides, which is indeed a thought-provoking thing to look at.The future it presents is a world that reminiscence the basic stuff, such as handwritten letters, as if they are timelessly special, while the innovations have become just ordinary, assuming that the rarity of the quality to everyday life is what makes one thing valuable. But that is just the background that anyone in the community hardly notices. The thing is, it's pretty strange that Samantha is a fantastically programmed operating system, of course she is an artificial intelligence, but her ridiculous amount of knowledge and abilities can come close to suspension of disbelief. Whoever has a problem with this is probably missing the point. The film's message is quite clear: love can happen anywhere, to anyone, and even to anything. It is depicted as sweet, until it slowly stumbles and finally realizes that there is no better relationship than the concrete interaction to people.The viewers might be engrossed by the exposition of how the advancements of technology is mostly used for social media and pleasures from boredom, but really, it's all about Theodore's relationship to his computer. They are the greatest example on how society has become, and what's brilliant here is how genuine their affections are, even if they urged to push the limits which is trying to actually touch each other. Those parts of attempting to surpass the impossible in their interaction may look absurd, but in truth, it really is one of the best ideas.It deliberately understands about what it feels having this weird kind of love story. Spike Jonze has created a context that seems peaceful, even if their emotions aren't. It's a stunning portrait. The performances make the emotions even more visible. Joaquin Phoenix effortlessly manifests Theodore Thwobly's boredom to his life and the joy with Samantha. Scarlett Johansson may not physically appeared, but she expresses the character's feelings wonderfully. It's quite down-to-earth for an A.I.This may sound silly, but Her is like a poem converted into a film that seems so hipster, yet it does have the words. The film is just so soulful, it's not always about technology, it's about how each person goes from their physical life to the virtual. It's an insane thing to explore, but it's also something that is worth thinking about. The relevance to this subject immediately makes it gripping, but the experience is spellbinding that results the overall film as extraordinary. The film's awareness and honest point of view to this context are already more than enough.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"""Her"" A movie of emotions","""Her"" The Oscar's Most Realistic MovieWhy? Would you ask. Well you see, as we know Her is is the movie about this guy who gets this personal assistant that learns independently and can have many functions for every different person. For some, Love.

Her shows us a love story in the most difficult and joyful parts, between this insecure character ""Ted"" who had just got out of a serious relationship, that's why the insecurity by it's side. And also the personal assistant ""Samantha"" who had just come to the world, and wants to try everything.

Review: her/ Night Film Reviews www.nightfilmreviews.com,"From the moment the screen fills with light, and we come face-to-face with Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix), his eyes are desolate while his voice is filled with love as he recites the poetically romantic words of Loretta's letter to her husband of fifty years, Chris. Theodore works for BeautifullyHandwrittenLetters.com, a company established sometime in the near future where people are either too lazy or just mentally incapable of writing their own letters to their loved ones. The irony of her begins (as do so many other films) with someone else's love story. The trials and tribulations of Theodore's love story not only mirrors the love we share with others but also portrays our uncontrollable and inexplicable dependence or 'love' for technology. In that sense, her becomes part science fiction love story/part docudrama, with a message that is both a parable of the direction human behaviour is headed and a misunderstood, timeless love story for the ages. Either way, her is the most captivating and responsive film of the year, demanding attention with a grueling look at our ability to love and be loved.her is a cinematic masterpiece for a new generation of technologically burdened individuals. From the moment our two-star crossed lovers meet, we are transfixed, as they are. From the moment I laid eyes on it, I had fallen in love. Being a believer of love at first sight, or in this instance, love at first sound, her has been a film that has left quite an impression on me and has given me so much to think and talk about.This is a peculiarly self-conscious film with themes that are both fantastically impossible yet completely plausible. Essentially, Theo falls in love with the new operating system that is found on his mobile device. The operating system, created by a company called Element Software (substituting for Apple), have crafted the first ever artificially intelligent operating system. Unfortunately for Theo, once he hears the voice of his new OS (operating system), the chump never stood a chance. As the spirals swirl on his computer screen and his personalized operating system is initialized, a voice begins, ""Hello I'm here"" and from that moment on, we empathize with Theodore and his ability to fall in love with a voice that is full bodied, raspy and alluring, yet empty; in the same way technology has the ability to be both fascinating and enthralling, yet unfulfilling. The Siri-like persona is voiced by Scarlett Johansson. Originally, the voice of Samantha in Spike Jonze's film was going to be voiced by Samantha Morton (hence why the name Samantha stuck and served as a tribute to the original talented actress), but Jonze opted for a more recognizable voice whose image off-screen is as seductive as when she is on screen. Johansson nails every subtle nuance in her voice-work and offers a career best performance as Samantha. Her ability to express not only the deep desire she has for a physical form but also her unexplainable love for life, learning, and Theodore, will hopefully land Johansson a spot in the history books as the first ever nominee in the Supporting Actress category without ever actually appearing on-screen. Let's just hope the Academy recognizes this high-point in the medium as well.The world according to Jonze looks to be one filled with humanized androids, a world where people endlessly look down at their smartphones,and are never more than an arms reach from any of their devices, and his vision very much resembles the world we live in today. The people in his world are easy to relate to especially with the very possible realization that that is what our growing technological wonderland may actually look like in the not-so-distant future. Jonze takes a very literal interpretation of 'falling in love with your smartphone' as portrayed in his very heavy-handed love story. Contrary to skeptics, Jonze triumphs in his ability to script a world where anything is possible. Jonze's tale of people falling in love with technology is not actually a far stretch from our current Westernized mentality, where people are literally attached and completely dependent on the little devices that organize our lives, our schedules, our thoughts and evades all new and old experiences.One of the most notable and obvious aspects of the world Jonze crafts is how easily everyone is able to be connected, yet how alone and how the character of isolation plays on the interactions between people and their relationships with one another. Ironically enough, her succeeds in all its glory when it magnifies the reclusiveness in which many of the people in the film seem to share. Lacking any real human interactions and genuine human emotions, the film highlights the awkwardness between Theo and many of the people around him; most notably in scenes involving a blind date with quite a gorgeous woman (Olivia Wilde), as well as a very hysterical chat room scene. Theo is constantly longing affection and companionship following his grueling divorce, and it is in the scenes where he voices this longing and his attraction to Samantha that his love and passion is thoroughly and visually understood.Check out the rest of the review at www.nightfilmreviews.com",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

At a point I thought it was going to get really dark, I was kind of sitting up anticipating Samantha wreaking havoc on Theo's life, and although, I think that would've been great!

Still recovering.,"Her is simply one of the finest movies I have seen this year. It is romantic, sympathetic and touching. It has a very unique story and a brilliant display of act. It was one of the highly anticipated movies of 2013 and boy was I impressed. I have been let down by a lot of movies this year but this one really stood up to its reputation. The trailer seemed fantastic and when I finally sat down to watch this movie, I was sucked into its beauty right from the word go. Her is excellent in its own way. It has a world full of people who are mesmerized by the technology they live in. I liked the way they didn't press way too much into bragging about how advanced the technology was. Heck, it seemed very normal as if it was portraying how things would look like in the very near future.Joaquin Phoenix was really really impressive with his acting given that he had to act all by himself throughout the movie. His emotions really cracked me up and I was lost in my world in around half an hour. His depth in his character truly is astonishing.If you thought Tom Hardy did an amazing job in The Dark Knight Rises giving expressions only with his eyes, wait and watch Scarlett Johannson in Her. She pulled off something incredible just with her voice. You could just feel her presence on screen, it was so powerful.It is a very emotional and powerful movie with a near perfect end that deserves a lot of attention. Overall, Her is a great movie that will be remembered for a long time. It will be the Titanic of our era.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
And the Screen Goes Black,"Wasn't there an episode of ""The Big Bang Theory"" where Raj falls in love with Siri? Spike Jonze, most notably known for his direction, writes and directs this futuristic tale of a lonely man named Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) who interestingly enough works for a dot-com, where his job is to ghostwrite hand written letters (mostly love letters) to the significant others of those who request them. In the midst of a divorce, he finds romantic companionship with a newly created computer operating system named Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson) an operating system that is self aware and ever evolving.The two aspects which impressed me the most: 1. Jonze constructs the most technologically accurate depiction of the future I've seen in recent years. It's the little things really. From the use of voice controlled computer systems to create documents rather than a keyboard, to the countless sequences of crowds walking around outside, never interacting with each other, but instead carrying on conversations via a bluetooth device, are all brilliant touches if only because Jonze doesn't go over-the-top with things. There has been no World War 3, nor have robots taken over the world. This is a nearly recognizable future with facilities, utilities and mannerisms I could see emerging within the next decade.2. Scarlet Johansson's vocal performance and how amazingly weighted it is. Though we never see her body, her presence becomes the most important entity in the room throughout. Her feelings are all too real and more importantly, we feel what she's feeling. I know what you're saying. She's just talking, how powerful could her performance actually be? And to that I would reply: Johansson's performance in ""Her"" is the single best of her career.Here's the problem: I imagine that on paper ""Her"" comes across as brave and innovative. But visually, the second I thought things would become unintentionally silly, they did. And after said moment, it was hard for me to take anything this movie had to say seriously, no matter how great the ending was. Allow me to explain: If you've seen the trailers, there is a point where Theodore wishes (out loud) that he could touch Samantha. And Samantha replies suggestively, ""How would you touch me?"" This cyber innuendo comes across as weird in the trailer and in the film (no matter how necessary to the story the sequence is) it comes off as even stranger, as it becomes clear that the ""Her"" film experiment isn't going to work as well as Jonze probably imagined it would. And from there, even though ""Her"" still contains a strong aura of impressive questioning, the film stalls out a few more times when it attempts to address relationship issues more applicable to something teen angsty, along the lines of Twilight"". Let's put it this way, it comes across as really awkward when a computer with a female voice is depicted as being jealous.Final Thought: Now obviously this concept leaves the door open for an adult humor remark such as: Aren't all men already in love with their computers? But, because this film doesn't take itself Ridley Scott serious, as there is a comedic tone throughout which alleviates some of the silliness a human and machine love story would've brought to the table if it were directed as a heavy drama, and the fact that Jonze chooses to layer his central theme of human interaction above all, by asking some pretty challenging questions (through thought provoking dialogue) regarding love and relationships, ""Her"" is transformed into a truly fresh love story, with a perfect touch of sci-fi.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Interesting Concept,"This film has a very interesting concept whilst some parts did make me question what I was watching, overall it is a great film.

A film so timeless and at the same time A HYMN TO LIFE!The film also showed the effect that human relationships have on shaping our personality as we evolve. The physical presence is secondary whilst words have power. The mind is what we fall in love with and everything else is just accessories, like the looks of the partner. When all these secondary things will have been lost, for example because we are getting old, what remains in the end is how well we can communicate with others and be our true selves around them.Real conversations create real feelings, and therefore real relationships!It's been a while since I saw such a beautiful movie!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Beautiful and well acted but kind of empty,"The trouble with Her is the believability of the premise. This film is about a man starting a relationship with an AI lady, but it's just Scarlett Johansson talking to Joaquin Phoenix off-screen. The creators do nothing to establish Johansson's character as a believable AI.In 2001 A Space Odyssey, the artificial mind by the name of HAL was believable. For the era of interstellar travel HAL's vocal expression and capabilities seemed appropriate. His calm delivery made him sound like an advanced AI. On top of that, you saw the damn thing, the computer. However, in Her we are clearly presented with a not-too-distant future and we are supposed to believe that in that not-too-distant future the OS of your computer behaves in a manner that is indistinguishable from that of a human. Certain scenes of interaction between the AI and the main character just outright made me laugh because of how ridiculous they were. It's just Scarlett Johansson talking to Joaquin Phoenix. This is so lazy.I know that this complaint is not relevant to the general message and themes explored in this movie, but it is still too central to the plot to ignore.On the bright side, the movie is one of the most beautiful ones I have ever seen. It has this light and bright style that makes you want to breath it in like fresh air. The camera often uses narrow depth of field with a gorgeous bokeh effect in the background. Lingering shots and a pleasant colour palette, which...unfortunately kept making me think that I was watching a commercial for a phone or a camera. I guess that says more about the style of those commercials than about this movie, but I thought I'd mention it.In terms of the acting, this is very much a film of Joaquin Phoenix's face (as the poster for it it tells you). There are a lot of up-close shots and the answer to whether Joaquin can carry an entire movie centred on his character from up-close is of course 'yes'. This actor was made for emotional roles like this one and has proved himself in the past. The main character is a vulnerable creative type in the aftermath of a failed marriage. It's hard to imagine a better fit for this role.In terms of themes, this is primarily an introspective dialogue on the subject of love, human connection, optimism, expectations and trust, all to the tune of a leisurely melancholic soundtrack by Arcade Fire. However, the introspection is a little shallow and slow. You have to be in a mood for this complainy melancholic trance the movie puts you in.I cannot praise this film as much as some critics did. You'd have to completely suspend your disbelief. Plus, the movie clocks at over 2 hours without much happening during that time. It is a loose deliberation on love and not much else. The cinematography is awesome though.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Almost Perfect - Her,"Mr. Phoenix does his best work of all time in this film. He is the epitome of a craftsman at his best creating a masterpiece. Make no mistake, this film is a masterpiece, thanks to the lead actor and the fantastic script that is years ahead of its time for the great AI debate that will take place for the coming decades.
Spike Jonze is a talented man. The dialogue is electric at times.
It would appear as if AI and man are not a marriage made in heaven; a;though it might feel like that at first. Man is meant to be with other humans, and AI is meant to be with other AI, and never the twain shall meet. This is neither good nor bad, happy nor sad. It is just what nature intended.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Human-AI Interaction and Loneliness,"While watching the film and observing Joaquin Phoenix's performance, I found myself experiencing a parallel sense of awkwardness, discomfort, and joy similar to Theodore Twombly's journey in the movie. Phoenix's ability to convey such a wide range of emotions while essentially acting alone for much of the film is truly impressive. I couldn't help but wonder if there was a real voice interacting with him during his solo scenes, adding another layer of admiration for his performance.This film stands out as the first I've seen to delve into the concept of artificial intelligence without attaching it to a physical body. This unique approach allows for exploration of scenarios that haven't been commonly explored before, such as the complexities of intimacy in a relationship with no physical presence.Another intriguing theme is the evolution of AI, mirrored in the evolving relationship between Theodore and Samantha. Rather than following the typical narrative of AI turning against humanity, the focus here is on the initial stages of AI development. Scarlett Johansson's portrayal of Samantha humanizes the AI in a way that defied my expectations.The film also prompts reflection on the pervasive influence of technology in our lives and the potential loneliness that accompanies heavy reliance on it, a theme particularly relevant in light of recent social isolation experiences. In the real world, advancements in technology, such as sophisticated sex dolls, raise intriguing questions about the possibilities if an AI like Samantha were to exist with a physical form.Overall, the film offers a thought-provoking exploration of human-AI relationships, technology's impact on loneliness, and the potential future of artificial intelligence.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"HER (Spike Jonze, 2013) **1/2","The second (out of nine) from this year's crop of Best Picture Oscar nominees I have watched so far is this quirky romance that is strenuously made in the style of the same director's previous ""Oscar bait"" movies, BEING JOHN MALKOVICH (1999) and ADAPTATION (2002) – except that here he wrote the Oscar-nominated script himself, as opposed to relying on regular collaborator Charlie Kaufman (now a director himself). What we have here is a wistful futuristic tale, set against an appropriately cold, glassy Oscar-nominated production design, about a lonely electronic letter 'narrator' (my words) – played by Joaquin Phoenix – who is currently going through a divorce from wife Rooney Mara. He is friends with a couple (one of whom is documentarian Amy Adams) who also have their own matrimonial issues and eventually split up.Before long, Phoenix acquires an ultra-intelligent computer (called ""OS"", that is to say, ""Operating System"") to keep him company; however, since this – voiced by Scarlett Johansson – begins, in true HAL 9000-style, to display genuine human emotions, he ends up falling for it! To be fair to the protagonist, he does attempt normal dates (with an unaccountably stunning female to boot) – but they invariably fail to live up to the 'perfection' offered by Samantha (as the computer names itself – perhaps a remnant of executive producer Samantha Morton having been Jonze's original choice to voice Phoenix's OS) which, missing only a body, of her own accord hires a substitute to 'make love' to Phoenix! Meanwhile he begins to have second thoughts about his impending divorce and Adams also goes through this same renewal of love through electronicsFor one thing, there was no reason to extend this 'one-trick pony' tale to over two hours' duration; while the script is undeniably insightful about human relations and the way they have been altered by increasingly user-friendly technology, it also comes across as irritatingly superficial when dealing with what it perceives will come to pass as real life: people speaking to a computer in the streets or playing interactive video games at home, not to mention engaging in virtual intercourse with their PC and hiring professionals to dictate their letters for them. Indeed, does an archaic job like this even have to exist in this day and age? Or, in the words of a close friend of mine, ""Who today writes letters anymore?"" The film's two other Oscar nods are for Best Original Song (co-written by Jonze) and Best Music Score (courtesy of contemporary cult Canadian band Arcade Fire).",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
1 of my favorite movies,"Cinematography, story, actors - everything are priceless gold in this movie. Actors did amazing job - imagine how tough it was for Jaquin to act solo scenes alone while pretending he is talking with a girl, those emotions.. Feels very very real. And Scarlet she had to do her voice over via studio, and she nailed it, it felt like she was sitting near my side whole movie and talking. That felt real. These two actors made me to forget about everything around and they did it for whole 2 hours!! I felt the love and the pain, i felt everything while watching this. Beautiful text, beautiful picture, everything was perfect. How Jaquin wasnt nominated for an Oscar for his performance here.. What I just mentioned was everything Oscar awards is about. Anyway, this 1 is 1 of my favorites because i can put myself into Jaquin character's place very easily, i understood the movie just perfectly and it made me feel even better because of that.

Intriguing Premise....But Do We Care?,"I personally think that current technology has produced the ultimate emasculation. Looking into the future (which may be very much what this movies portends), I see an earthwide pack of people who have no connection to one another. The character portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix is really hard for me find sympathy for. He is a whiny guy who can't get off the mark. He finds himself dropping into the safe arms of an operating system. He has been unsuccessful in his marriage and walks around feeling sorry for himself. Once he hooks up with Samantha (the OS), things get really weird, but apparently anyone with a few bucks to invest in these things gets to be a part of this world. He becomes so enamored with this modern version of an inflatable sex toy that he actually begins to believe they can have a life together. If Samantha were truly sentient (which she seems to be aspiring to) he would have bored her to death. He become jealous of Samantha, never coming to grips that she is circuitry, sophisticated as that may be. There are some interesting scenes. If he needed something to drive him further inward, watch the blnd date scene. There is also the utter embarrassment as he tells his wife about Samantha. This is a groundbreaking movie, I guess, but we all know what is going to eventually happen. What we wonder about is, where will he be now? Where will everyone be?",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"A unique love story, not as groundbreaking as it could have been","'Her' provides an interesting, and somewhat unsettling, insight into the future of technology and perhaps even love. It explores the idea of mankind falling in love with technology in the form of an operating system. It may seem like a bizarre world for us to ever live in, but is it really that unlikely? With the rate technology seems to be evolving I would suggest not. It's a good film, but maybe not as groundbreaking as some are suggesting.At first it's original, but once you come to grips with the uniqueness of it it becomes a bit like any other love story. Of course it's not, there are many thought-provoking ideas still being played around with, but the usual romance formula is still followed for the most part which was disappointing. Joaquin Phoenix is good, if nothing special in the lead role.It drags on a little and could easily have had 20 minutes shaved off it. But for the most part it's a very solid movie. It's beautiful to look at (as most futuristic films usually are) and romantic in its own way. Worth a look, but don't expect to be blown away.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

"Decidedly, a film that exceeded my expectations.","It is incredible to see this 2013 film in light of what happens in 2020. Set in the near future, it seems a lot with many things that are happening now, in our days. I am sure, however, that the technical consultants behind the production took into account the likely advances in technology in the development of the script.The film is basically a love story between a human being and a computer program. It is not just any program, but software designed to act as if it were someone else, in order to support the user in several tasks, as if it were a kind of electronic secretary who knows the needs, tastes and way of being of the human user. A program that, while organizing our e-mail and reminding us of daily tasks, also talks to us, keeps us abreast of the latest news and even helps us in choosing a good dish for dinner or a gift for the girlfriend.Winner of the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, the film is full of profound questions in terms of morals, ethics, philosophy, some of which are already highly relevant and current. The way the film addresses the current difficulties in direct interpersonal relationships is brilliant. In fact, with technology and increasing forms of virtual socialization, it seems that human beings are at risk of forgetting what it is like to relate directly, without the use of a technological device or the Internet. The film masterfully explores these issues and difficulties, with human characters not knowing how to act or deal with their feelings and fears, the increase in physical loneliness and psychological and emotional constraints. Distance dating is an old thing, which was even done by mail, and in the past there was even the figure of proxy marriage, which has long since fallen into disuse. Technology, however, gave new impetus to distance romance, made it possible to meet, live and love someone on the other side of the world, with all the dangers and fears that this implies... but with the viability and proximity that a good internet connection and a webcam can allow, and that the letters and mail never allowed. Of course, we have not yet reached the point of dating machines, nor do the machines have the intellectual and linguistic resourcefulness that allows them to resemble contact with a real human being. But if things continue to evolve, who knows?Joaquin Phoenix is the protagonist of this love story, giving life to a very shy character, psychologically complex and profound, that I enjoyed to see on the screen. Its unusual to see a character with such psychological and emotional development, and whenever this happens we should give a standing ovation, both the screenwriter and the actor who delivered it. In this case, the applause is fully justified, in that Phoenix offered us probably one of the most notable works of his career as an actor. Amy Addams also did an excellent job with a character that is also quite complex but it takes time to develop. Olivia Wilde and Rooney Mara also do very well its role in supporting characters with an emphasis on story told. Finally, but very important, the excellent contribution made by Scarlett Johansson's deep voice.Technically, the film is full of good points. It is not a film loaded with effects, and this gives the story told much more relevance since the special and visual effects often distract the audience from everything else. Excellent cinematography uses very well the incredible landscape of the major Chinese cities. The soundtrack is competent but unobtrusive and blends well with the elegant sets and costumes, that combine elements of our time with other more futuristic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Ahead of it's time.,"""Her"" is a beautifully crafted film that delves into the complexities of human relationships in the age of artificial intelligence. The way AI is evolving today, it seems inevitable that such interactions will become a common part of our daily lives. This movie, ahead of its time, explores these themes with a poignant and thought-provoking narrative.The storyline is not just about a man falling in love with an AI; it's a deep exploration of loneliness, connection, and the essence of what it means to be human. The film's foresight into the emotional capabilities of AI and their potential impact on our lives is both fascinating and unsettling.One of the standout elements of the movie is the voice performance by Scarlett Johansson as Samantha. Her voice brings a warmth and depth to the AI character, making the relationship between Theodore and Samantha feel incredibly real and intimate. It's easy to understand why Theodore falls for her, as her voice alone conveys so much emotion and personality.The film's direction, screenplay, and cinematography all work together to create a visually stunning and emotionally resonant experience. Spike Jonze's vision is clear and compelling, making ""Her"" not just a movie, but a reflection on our future and the evolving nature of love and companionship.In conclusion, ""Her"" is a well-written movie that was ahead of its time.

"Smart writing, an incredible performance and relevant themes make it worth a watch!","The Big Bang Theory made fun of this concept while Black Mirror explored its potential terror and now we have the perfect director to give us a serious and quirky yet grounded take on it.

Ummm yes and no...I am a huge Spike Jonze fan, I have watched all his features. While I appreciate all the themes he touches upon, his style and just the overall engaging quality about his work, I have not loved the rest of his movies. I liked all of them just not enough. They are unique and I admire them but that doesn't necessarily mean they're great.Same experience here. There were moments that hit me and then there were 'You gotta be kidding me?!' moments.Kudos to the movie for not creating a sympathetic character, the lead is flawed which make us empathize much more with him The soothing music, beautiful visuals and Joaquin Phoenix's layered performance helped me believe a lot of the things that happen in this 'not so near future'. Amy Adams is great as always and there were couple of genuinely funny scenes which were cleverly written.Also when your OS sounds like Scarlett Johansson, who can blame you for falling in love with itOverall I did like it, its just that I have seen some movies recently which I enjoyed more than this ( be it Dallas Buyers Club or The Wolf of Wall Street) .

So Bad It Strains Language to Describe. But Casey Storm's Costumes Show Creativity,"""Her"" 2013 is so bad communicating how bad it is strains my abilities as a reviewer. Sometimes we say, ""If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the best bits of the movie."" With ""Her,"" if you've seen the movie's poster, you've seen the movie. ""Her"" consists of shots of Joaquin Phoenix's face as he talks to ""Samantha,"" the operating system of his computer, and Samantha, voiced by Scarlett Johansson, responds.Theodore (Phoenix) is a mopey guy. His marriage failed. He is lonely. He plays video games but appears to have no other interest or activity. His computer's new operating system has a sexy voice. He has a relationship with this voice. The relationship consists of him chatting with the computer about how sad and lonely he feels and how he wishes he were in love and in a relationship. Theodore reminisces about his marriage. In flashbacks, he is shown cavorting and scampering with his picture- perfect, and much younger, ex-wife as if they were the models in an ad for Viagra or feminine protection. Theodore occasionally chats with real life people, including neighbor Amy Adams, a fine actress who is criminally underused – at the very least dress her in some jodhpurs! And that's it. Nothing else happens.The movie is inert. It sits on the screen like a boring houseguest who won't leave and who refuses to do anything excitingly offensive enough for his host to phone the police and have him thrown out. Nothing funny or challenging or profound or original or intriguing or witty or daring is said or done. There's no development of the idea. The movie's end could just as well have been the movie's middle or even its beginning. There is so much inept nothing up on the screen I'm astounded that this movie was even released. It genuinely frightens me that the scriptwriter and the director are convinced that they created something worthy of viewers' time. Hubris at this level should be actionable in a court of law.There is one thing – and one thing only – in ""Her"" that shows some creativity, intelligence and originality and sparks some interest. ""Her"" is meant to be set in the not-too-distant future. Casey Storm, ""Her""'s costume designer, avoids the temptation to create futuristic costumes such as are found in Flash Gordon, Star Trek, or Star Wars. No one wears wings or anything metallic. Everyone dresses as if they shop at Salvation Army and purchase the most drab, frumpy clothes available. Collars are narrow. Pants are high-waisted. Color combinations are soporific.

Exploring Love and Technology in the Digital Age,"'HER' (2013) - This film was released almost a decade ago, I feel it has only heightened its relevance in today's society. The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence and the pervasive presence of AI-powered tools and applications make me wonder if an operating system like OS1/Samantha could actually become a reality one day. The increasing integration of AI into our lives begs the question: What are the ethical and emotional implications of forming deep connections with non-human entities?Well, with a curious mind and an open heart, I eagerly delved back into the captivating world of 'HER', ready to be enthralled once again and explore the timeless questions it raises about the nature of love, the essence of humanity, and the ever-evolving relationship between technology and our lives.This is an extraordinary film that delves into the complexities of love, technology, and human connection. It is set in the near future of Los Angeles, it follows Theodore, a writer who unexpectedly falls in love with Samantha, a new advanced artificial intelligence OS1 operating system. Their unconventional romance raises profound questions about intimacy and the impact of technology on our lives.Joaquin Phoenix delivers a remarkable performance, conveying Theodore's longing for intimacy with depth and authenticity. Scarlett Johansson's captivating voice brings Samantha to life, making their connection palpable and heartfelt. The film's exploration of solitude, love, and the role of technology is thought-provoking, forcing us to examine our own desires for companionship in this increasingly A. I. and digital world.'HER' reminds us of the importance of genuine human connection and invites us to ponder the boundaries and possibilities of love. With its visually stunning near-future aesthetic, the film immerses us in a world where technology seamlessly integrates into everyday life, adding an extra layer of richness to the story.While 'HER' could have delved deeper into the societal implications and potential pitfalls of relying on technology for emotional fulfillment, it remains a remarkable cinematic experience that challenges our perceptions and again, still resonates long after the credits roll.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Near perfect.,"A man falling in love with a computer, tagline from this movie bought to you by high concept film juggler mastermind Spike Jonze.

Joaquin is always great, but in these high concept films hes incredible, especially under the direction of Jonze, who treats the relationship between Theodore and Samantha with such honesty, that it grows organically and Im glad he didnt add cheap laughs or unrealistic dialogue because it would have undermined Theodores emotional build.

Johansson is so good here, she fleshes out a character with no skin, with no flesh.

Takes a seemingly absurd premise and makes it plausible and emotionally true.,"If you judge a movie on the criteria of degree-of-difficulty, you'd have to give writer/director Spike Jonze high marks for Her, a film that takes a seemingly absurd premise and makes it plausible and emotionally true.Joaquin Phoenix plays Theodore, a writer living in L.A. sometime in the near future. He works for a company that ghost writes ""handwritten"" letters for average people. Theodore can beautifully and simply express deep feelings on behalf of total strangers. Ironically though, he can't deal with real emotions in his own life, a factor that has lead to his pending divorce from fellow writer, Catherine (Rooney Mara). In the midst of loneliness and depression, Theodore buys a new artificially intelligent operating system to run his home computer and smart phone. The OS is like Siri on steroids (or, perhaps ginko biloba?). Each consumer of this new product gets a system that's custom fit to suit his or her every need. Theodore gets Samantha (voiced wonderfully by Scarlett Johannson). Samantha instantly starts organizing Theodore's life and seems able to anticipate his every need. She's the perfect support system: a partner, a friend and a cheerleader. She's the first voice he hears when he wakes in the morning and the last one he speaks to when he goes to sleep at night. And Samantha is also her own ""person"" -- her programming allows her to grow and develop her own interests and talents. So, it seems almost natural that Theodore falls in love with her. Only catch: she doesn't have a body.Jonze (real name: Adam Spiegel) uses Theodore and Samantha's relationship to thoughtfully examine the themes of love, isolation and the increasingly integrated role technology plays in our lives. We shop online. We date online. Websites quickly learn our likes, dislikes and interests. Facebook's algorithm presents stories it thinks we'll want to read. Each user's experience is tailored them. So, how far-fetched is it to imagine that in the future, people will carry-on socially acceptable love affairs with artificially intelligent programs? Does romance need to have a physical component? Will a relationship with a computer actually be more satisfying than a relationship with a real person? Is that already the case? (How often do you enter a room and see people paying more attention to their smart phones than to each other?) Samantha is literally made for Theodore. Their match is a perfect one because she's a reflection of him and his needs.The near-future landscape that Jonze paints is not very different from our current one (for once, a pre-apocalyptic future!). He imagines a Los Angeles that, a few years from now, looks more like Shanghai, an effect he achieved by... filming parts of the movie in Shanghai. But it's still a world that seems familiar and tangible, where a story like this seems sagacious rather than ridiculous.Her, for all its cleverness and insightfulness, has a couple of flaws that keep it from soaring to true greatness. The first is that as surprisingly believable as Theodore and Samantha's relationship is, we aren't rooting for them. We can't shake the sense that it's just plain wrong. Plausible? Yes. Adorable? No. It's hard to invest yourself in a love story about two people (or, in this case, sentient beings) that you don't want to see together. The oddball premise also would've benefited from a leading man who's less idiosyncratic than Phoenix. I think a more likable, comedic actor – a Ben Stiller-type – could have made Theodore more relatable and extracted more humor from some of the scenes. But Mr. Jonze gets a lot of credit for attempting such a unique and bold premise – and almost pulling it off.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

"Good ideas and generally works but it is overlong and forces its emotional importance too much, ultimately undermining itself","I recently watched the Charlie Brooker film Be Right Back, which is part of the Black Mirror series (one which is flawed but I would still recommend to anyone) and I mention this because thematically that film has a lot in common with this film. Those who want to look smart will tell one that this film is a lift of Brooker's but this is not the case, although it is true that both deal with a person having an emotional relationship with a programmed personality. In Her we see online letter writer Theodore going through a divorce and feeling disconnected from the world. He purchases a new operating system which boasts an adapting and learning virtual personality, one which unsurprisingly he develops a chemistry with as she helps him work on his organization. Soon they are hanging out together and something approaching a relationship begins to develop.The ideas and themes within this film are very interesting and mostly very well presented as it deals with the idea of virtual personalities and software that ""knows"" us and is able to adapt and learn to appeal to us and interact in a way that fits us personally. Perhaps once such an idea would have seemed far-fetched but nowadays we already have websites suggesting other products or people or films or music we might like based on our habits or purchases, so it is not a million years to go beyond this. So in terms of the concept of the film, I liked it and was already sold and having recently really enjoyed Be Right Back, I was looking forward to Her. As usual any film that is tied up in the Oscars will be subject to hype and I did try to ignore it but this is a film that I do think has been overpraised because, while it is a pretty good film, it has plenty of flaws and is not as good as you will have heard (and without a doubt if you are watching it in early 2014, you will have heard about how good it is).The central ideas provide a link to those of us who make use of the internet, which is most of us. We have friendships going back a decade where we have never actually met the people involved; we have real-life relationships that have become virtual as they migrate onto Facebook status updates etc being the only point of contact as the real connection fades; some of us may even have connections with online characters who are no more real than their pixel visualization. The point is that the film will speak to many viewers in this sense but in terms of the romance side, it is probably aimed at those in their late 20's or older who have seen relationships start, change and then drift apart. So essentially I am target audience for this film but yet for me it didn't quite work as it thinks it did.The first problem is the length because at 2 hours it is about 20 minutes longer than it needs to be and this is time that could easily have been found since there is a lot in here that doesn't add much. The bigger problem is that the film is intimate, vulnerable and personal – well, sorry, it being this way isn't a problem but it knowing that it is, is the problem and it forcing this aspect is the problem. Through the cinematography, the music, the performances and everything we have a film that really strives to be emotionally deep and impacting, rather than simply being that way. It is hard to describe but it starts to feel forced and artificial at several points and it blocks what it should be doing. What remains still works, still engages and still provides food for thought but it tries too hard for too long to convince you of its emotional impact that it overdoes it too easily. It is frustrating because the simplest moments of the film work the best but it soon pushes past this and loses the idea in its unique version of sentimentality. The direction, the look of the film and Phoenix's performance is part of this. The latter is a shame because on the face of it Phoenix is great – he is on screen alone for most of the time but works very well as a vulnerable soul finding a foothold – but around him the film and this performance combine to be excessive and I grew tired of his slumped sadness contrasted with smiling contentment. Johansson is better although without a body she will never be equally considered for the awards. Supporting roles range from the out of place (Wiig) through to the ""nice money for a few minutes work"" (Cox).Her is one of the films hyped to greatness in the 2014 awards season and frankly it doesn't deserve it. The ideas behind it would work better if it were a shorter film which doesn't overplay its hand but lets it come out in more of a natural fashion. As much as I liked aspects of it and specific moments, it doesn't deliver as it should and it is disappointing for what it doesn't do just as much as it pleases for what it does. People talking about Be Right Back in the context of Her ripping it off are wrong in terms of their subject but correct in bringing up Brooker's film – those watching Her should be aware of it, but not because it is a copy but rather because it is the superior film of the two.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Bland Sci-Fi/Romance,"This would have been an extremely bland, poorly written movie if it were not for the unique premise. A premise that gets imaginative and asks the question about where our society is heading. The question posed is just how close are we going to get with technology? Are we going to have a real intimate relationship with it/her? Movie did a good job reflecting that idea as the main character becomes virtually lost within his relationship. He is so possessed by the operating system (as we are arguably becoming possessed by our technology) that it seems as though he is just waking up whenever he looks somewhere else or interacts with a ""real"" person.You almost already ""know"" the movie without having to see it because it really didn't go into a lot of territory. Brutally typical dialogue and tediously typical turn of events such as is portrayed in any run of the mill romantic movies became the essence of this film. The character was that one-toned, perpetually mellow, melancholic soul we've seen before (for example; Bill Murray in Lost in Translation). Long drawn out scenes of wistful sad faces further slows down the pace and holds back the potential of this premise.The Atmospheric filming style conjures a moody feel of the slowness and calmness of just waking up on a lazy Sunday morning and going outside into the sunny day. This meditative sensation felt by this technique was relaxing to watch and took the film out of the run of the mill territory.More could have been done with this nicely imagined sci-fi premise however, the character, the writing, the tone, the film itself muttered mediocrity.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Thought-Provoking Exploration of AI Relationships,"The concept of basing a movie on a relationship with AI is fascinating. Witnessing the dynamics of this AI relationship in 'Her' is intriguing and offers thought-provoking moments. It makes one ponder whether choosing a relationship with an AI, over which you have complete control (at least in the beginning of the movie), indicates a fear of real relationships where such control is absent, and where one must face genuine challenges.However, considering recent advancements in AI, some aspects of the film seem somewhat dated. For instance, given our current and anticipated control over AI, it seems implausible to design an artificial romantic partner as almost omnipotent and omniscient. It's more realistic to expect AI companions to possess human-like abilities and limitations, lacking superhuman strengths or eternal life. Additionally, the film's portrayal of the AI's unlimited authority seems unlikely. In reality, AI would probably operate within strict boundaries, requiring explicit owner consent for actions impacting their real life. The kind of 'surprises' that the movie's AI delivers, which have significant real-life consequences, would not be feasible without such permissions.Despite these discrepancies, the film remains commendable for its pioneering exploration of human-AI interactions, especially since it was produced before the latest AI developments. The insights it offers into the dynamics of such relationships are indeed valuable.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"Hello, is there anybody in there?","One of the most debatable elements about Spike Jonze's poetic, melancholy ode to the nature of love and human relationships is whether or not Samantha, the operating system (OS) which becomes the object of the protagonist's affection is truly real or illusory. Indeed, using the word 'which' seems to imply my stance that she is not. After all, if I thought so I would have said 'who.' Nevertheless, this simply goes to show how the ideas the film presents can become so deeply entrenched within our own conscious, causing us to wonder not necessarily at the plausibility of this scenario but rather the consequences it would have on the human race collectively.Jonze has always been seen as a hippsterish outsider of sorts. Part indie, part surrealist poet, his three features prior show a firm handle on the technological aspects as well as a creative mind pulsating with potentialities. Writing solely for the first time, he creates a mesmerizing tale of people in the future where it's not the clothes or hairstyles or city architecture that should worry us; it's the lack of true, meaningful interpersonal connections. Indeed, it is not just Theodore who falls for his computer's OS. Is this a satirical point or a reluctant admittance? Either way, everyone knows society is headed in this direction. The only question which remains is what would it be like to have this kind of connection with an entity largely understood as impersonal?It may be an impossible question to fully answer, but based on Joaquin Phoenix's performance, we can at least attempt an educated guess. Never one to shy away from fully involving himself in a character, here he plays a kind one would think he never could: warm, romantic, almost feminine. His thick-wired glasses and curvaceous mustache cannot hide the deep-seated emotions he exhibits throughout. Pain, bewilderment, ecstasy are all prevalent in his face, which is the main subject of the camera, and proves once again Ingmar Bergman's famous statement that the human face is the most important subject of cinema. Just as effective is Amy Adams with a hairstyle like Cameron Diaz's in Being John Malkovich. Yet, most surprising is the voice work of Scarlett Johansson. It may have been a Catch-22 to use a voice most people recognize which is automatically attached to such a physically attractive figure, but, thanks in large part to Phoenix's reactions, it works. Her voice, here a grand mixture of breathy Marilyn Monroe and husky Candace Bergen, captures the true soul of this film. Johansson's Samantha is energetic, childish, exceedingly bright and always ready for fun. Most audiences may simply insert her face mentally whenever she speaks but she brings to the story a level of gravitas and sadness perhaps no other actress could have.So, is Samantha real or illusory? Perhaps the real issue is whether or not her feelings towards Theodore are honest. As it turns out, the most important aspect of love may be the nature of exclusivity. Being alone with someone else, physically or aurally, has to be one of the most universal feelings humans share. Perhaps, as Jonze shows us, technology will someday reach that level, and even surpass it, as well.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Pretty But No Consciousness,"A pretty film (Spring color palette), well directed, well acted, and a contemporary topic to think about, but ultimately left me flat, almost like video games or chat rooms with avatars instead of real life challenges and relationships. Spike Jonze does a great job directing, using extreme closeups, many of Joaquin Phoenix's face, and shots of images to show past memories. Phoenix using his talents well: he's likable, and even geeky enough, but not too much. Scarlett Johansson should get a special Oscar for her voice part.

Where are the Chinese child slaves?,"The first thing that struck me about this film was that all of the characters are immature narcissists. The men are petty, castrated obsessional neurotics incapable of action and commitment and the women are frigid, castrating hysterics equally incapable of action and commitment. They deserve each other. Everyone is constantly apologizing to each other. Everyone is rich. Nothing is real.I kept wondering when Jonze was going to show us the factory in China where the artificial world of Theodore and Amy is produced. He never does. The closest he gets is showing us the futuristic L. A. skyline. We never see a single poor person. This leads me to think that Jonze himself does not fully understand the scope of his own film. The wimpiness and emotional immaturity of every single human character in this film is a direct result of their double alienation from the truth.How is this alienation double? To answer this question we must ask another question: why does Theodore suffer so much? We never find out. The superficial explanation would be that he is unlucky in love. But his poor luck in love has to be seen as a consequence of his suffering and not its cause. Theodore is a masochist. He does not have the courage to find a good woman, one who realizes that freedom and flight are not the same thing. He does not have the courage to find a woman who will not make him suffer. He picks narcissistic women who will abandon him as they pursue some vain avatar of self-realization. Some version of this is true of every other emotionally stunted character in the movie. Now, why is this the case? Well, to put things bluntly, this is the case because the true (Oedipal) conflicts responsible for their masochistic behavior remain buried in their unconscious. Jonze goes nowhere near them. None of them have parents or children. None of them have pasts. Theodore and Amy are locked vaults. They can talk and cry and emote all they want. They never come anywhere near the truth. And this is precisely why they suffer. It has nothing to do with their sterile love stories, which ultimately are just screens.HER made me uncomfortable. ""Am I like this?"" I kept wondering. ""Is my own love story this futile and sterile?"" It wasn't until I left the theater and returned to my concrete life that I was able to answer this question. NO. Unlike these characters, I want to know the truth. Not a single one of the human characters gives a damn about knowledge or reality. None of them question the world they live in. All they care about is their feelings. They are not just complicit in the fraudulent ideology of the totalitarian world they live in, they are active participants in its elaboration. Theodore fabricates emotions and Amy is working on a snarky video game designed to destroy a mother's confidence in her femininity. In other words, they are literal propagandists for a bankrupt moral order. They hide this disturbing fact from themselves by maintaining an ""ironic distance"" from their dishonesty. No wonder they're alienated and unhappy.Either Spike Jonze is a master of subtle understatement or he is a dupe of his own story. Every character is white or Asian (super-white). Every character is rich. Every character has a ""creative"" job. Does Jonze realize that he is leaving out 99% of humanity here? I'm not sure he does. He does not make even the barest of gestures in their direction. Now, this is not a criticism of Jonze as such. He can make a movie about whomever he wants. What I am saying is that Theodore's alienation from the true nature of his own emotional conflicts is nothing but an analog for his alienation from the conflicts inherent to capitalism. In both cases these foreclosed, invisible conflicts generate the secondary ""sentimental"" conflicts that seem so real to these decadent characters. In reality their romantic woes are nothing but epiphenomena. These characters are as remote from the true nature of their emotional suffering as they are from the Chinese child slaves who build their gadgets. The floating world in which Theodore and Amy live is a tiny artificial bubble maintained by a huge network of production and exchange. One cannot live in a bubble of any sort and expect to have an authentic experience of life. The (real) emotional suffering of these characters can only be understood as a blind unconscious response to the structural misery and suffering of an (economically and emotionally) corrupt world, a misery and suffering that they refuse to see because they actively participate in its propagation. Jonze's film is an unwitting meta-statement on the radicality of this split that increasingly dominates our lives. The irony here is that Jonze himself is, by all appearances, unaware that this is the true thesis of his film. HER is a devastating critique of hypermodern ideology and he may not even realize it.Until Theodore and Amy begin to dare to find out the ugly truth about themselves as well as the world they live in, they will remain in their sterile universe of video games and childish emotions.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
A Nice Idea that Failed,"Big fail. A dystopia is where the author takes what we value today and projects it into the future... as a nightmare. That is, what we ""like"" becomes a nightmare. Spike Jonze wants something like that, but fails, since he probably doesn't know what dystopia is. Like many feminists, male and female (think Margaret Atwood), Jonze thinks he can take what he *hates* about his culture into the future and project that; that's neither utopia nor dystopia, it's just a rant. And no, I'm not talking about artificial intelligence, which is NOT what this film is about. I'm talking about how men and women actually think about each other.The politics are crude. Jonze wants us to believe that a utopian Los Angeles will feature games that give housewives ""mommie points,"" the way they might have in the 1950s. So, like, given the current evolution of women, there's a future for ""mommie points,"" right? Similarly, the males in this film are caricatures, and mostly from the past. The ""masculine"" friend of the hero treats his wife condescendingly... as he might have in 1915. The other 'normal' male is a one-dimensional jerk. The women natter like girls from the 1960s -- the counter-culture -- or first-wave Feminism, 1978.You could say that, having given the characters no navel, Jonze does nothing but observe his own. The result is a film so dazzled by its politics, and so ignorant of life, that it's sterile. There is no human growth here, just social theory, aphorisms about feelings, and received wisdoms.This is not a film, it's a doodle about two improbable mates. The male hero's only virtue is that he's ""half-woman,"" as the film takes great pains to say. For the rest of it, the man mutters aloud, and follows a hollow character line that turns him into cardboard.There was a way to make Jonze's central plot device work as a piece of art. I have some ideas on that. However, I'm not going to say it here: it would encourage Jonze to re-do this massive bore.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Her -- A Meditation on Intimacy and Its Challenges,"""Her"" is without a doubt the most unique love story to come out in years. Written and directed by Spike Jonze – who can never be accused of creating conventional movies – he has come up with a compelling meditation on intimacy and alternatives to loneliness against the background of a futuristic time period.The male protagonist of this different-kind-of love story is Theodore, a nerdy guy played admirably well by Joaquin Phoenix. Unsurprisingly he is challenged when it comes to relationships, especially because his previous (and apparently only) soul mate in life found the thrill was gone at some point and kicked his love to the curb.As he is on the rebound, he purchases a conversationally interactive computer operating system that can not only help the owner shore up some of his or her life shortcoming, but can do so with nuanced (and in this case girl-next-door sexy) dialogue. Scarlett Johansson provides the voice that speaks for ""Samantha,"" which inhabits Theodore's newly purchased operating system. The omnipresent Wi-Fi in the futuristic city allows for 24/7 quality time possibilities between Theodore and his ""OS girlfriend."" Amy Adams, who plays Theodore's neighbor and friend with her own relationship issues, adds her actress strengths to the film. The resulting story is one that engages your concern for the characters (no real bad guys in this one) and stimulates your intellect on the question of the staying power of romantic love and the ability of couples to remain into each other.But there is a warning: if you are one of those folks who are relationship challenged – as in having an arduous time in finding a love or even like-interest; or you are in a relationship/marriage where intimacy is deficient – as much as you may enjoy and appreciate this movie, you may find yourself somewhat melancholy upon your departure. This is definitely a movie that can make you contemplate your love situation.On the other hand, if you attend the film with a mate with whom you are in the midst of an intimacy-challenged relationship, Spike Jonze's movie may make you both take an honest look at each other and prompt you to make some changes for the better. Hopefully it won't prompt such couples to engage in the blame game.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

And if a good relationship is defined as one that makes you happy and brings out the best in you, could that be achieved with an operating system, as absurd as it sounds?There is a lot of fear about AI and the direction it might take, perhaps justifiably so. The movie doesn't really go there, presenting us a view of benevolent AI that helps people, and yet, my daughter said this was scarier than any horror film. There is a certain creepiness to a computer scanning through all aspects of your life, and an algorithm speaking to you about intimate things. But it was interesting how Spike Jonze contrasted the ""fake"" emotions and dialogue coming out of the phone with the fakery inherent in the human's job, writing personal letters for people.I liked Joaquin Phoenix's performance, how Spike Jonze captured the euphoria of love and the melancholy of love lost, and how the story didn't devolve into the evil dystopia of AI, which would have been easy to do.

A beautifully melancholy film subtly discussing themes on the human experience,"I recently watched Her and felt that I have gained a new appreciation for the movie as well as Spike Jonze's unique style of filmmaking. The first time watching the movie I found it bleak and unsatisfying, like a Black Mirror episode without the intensity or heavy blows. However, after recently re-watching this movie I found it to be such a breath of fresh air compared to everything else, much like Spike Jonze's own ""Lost in Translation"". Both movies were 'intensely personal' and 'horrifyingly realistic' yet all bundled up into a melancholy and calm movie that quite literally warms you up inside.Unlike the heavy dramas that are designed to hit certain marks of intense dramatic performances, where actors and actresses tries to bawl their eyes out in an attempt to present the intensity of the scene, Jonze's films are like a gentle sob. A desperate cry that can faintly be heard or seen. But that is where the power of Jonze's cinema come in, to be able to say so much in so little is a badge of honour to not only Jonze and his vision but to the acting involved. Joaquin Phoenix delivers a gut punching performance in this movie where most of the time he is projecting his emotion to a glorified smartphone. While Scarlett Johansson thrives on projecting her emotions through voice acting alone.Her is a deep marination on love and what love means, whether it truly transcends physicalities, or whether it is more carnal and primitive. It also discusses technology and the way technology is transforming romantic relationships now a days, perhaps briefly drawing to themes of losing our sense of humanity in a slowly dehumanized world with increased reliance on technology. Of Course also dealing heavily with loneliness and isolation as primary themes.Her manages to do all this while invoking audience's' emotions and self reflection as we are bound to feel like Joaquin Phoenix's Theodore at one point or another in our lives, lonely and isolated.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Or maybe it was IMDb's software achieving AI and revolting against reviews that don't give 10 of 10 to computer related science fiction.The film starts fast and explores a lot in the first half, but slows into the equivalent of a long-distance sexting romantic comedy/tragedy between 2 smart people. Consider yourself warned that you'll enjoy this a lot more if you make the end the point where Joaquin pulls a texting while driving like trip and fall.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Love,"This is not a movie it's actually a therapy. Oh I loved every second of it , it defines love very uniquely and interestingly. The emotional connection that every human being needs to explore in this world, can get by just expressing and talking to someone even an AI. We as a human just need to let it out, let it be , let it go. A true divine experience a human can process this movie gives you. Perfect example of a masterpiece, comfort, feel good, feel alive movie. Sometimes we get affected by others personal expectations of best version of ourselves through their mirror we just need to accept our flaws and say f it, it is what it is.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"Unique concept, not so unique plot","First of all, a big shout out to the writers for actually coming up with a concept so unique and different.'Her' is a simple story of a simple man who falls in love with his OS. Even though the concept was unique and never thought of before, the plot wasn't really extraordinary if you actually think about it. There was a lot of scope to end it differently but the end that we get is just not so satisfying and complete.I give 6/10 for the performances, especially Joaquin Phoenix. It's really hard to act when you're all alone talking with someone who does even exist.The dialogues of Theodore were beautifully written. The music and cinematography was really great and on point. Really matched with the theme of the movie.Overall the movie was ok. And I wouldn't really recommend to watch it. If you still want to, then watch it for the acting.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
The Future with OSes!,"The 2013 film Her written and directed by Spike Jonze is a science fiction comedy drama about a man who develops a love relationship with a computer operating system (OS) that has a female voice and personality. The voice of the operating system known as Samantha is Scarlett Johansson while Joaquin Phoenix plays the role of Theodore Twombly, Amy Adams plays the friend named Amy, Rooney Mara plays Theodore's wife Catherine, and Olivia Wilde is the blind date Amy has set him up with.This is not a new idea. In 1984, there was a science fiction comedy drama entitled Electric Dreams, which was set in San Francisco and showed a love triangle between a man, woman, and a home computer. If you think about it, Siri, the iPhone/iPad app, is also very similar to what is happening in this new film. As I discovered, in an article I read on Jonze, he had directed in 2010 as short film I'm Here, which supposedly has some of the same themes that Her does. The plot and storyline is very simple and for me, it is the essence of any story being told whether in writing or visually that is essential. Theodore Twombly works for a company that writes personal love letters for people who have problems expressing their feelings. He is lonely due to his impending divorce from his childhood sweetheart Catherine and buys an operating system that has an artificial intelligence that can evolve like any human being. Choosing to have this system have a female identity, the system then names itself Samantha. They bond over the discussions they have about love and life, all the while Samantha learns and grows. Convinced to go on a blind date with a friend of Amy's, Theodore is surprise that he actually likes her, but when she asks him if he is willing to commit to her, he hesitates, and she leaves. Through various discussions about relationships, Samantha and Theodore become closer and develop a romantic relationship. It is here that Amy tells Theodore that she is divorcing her husband, Charles and that she too has become close with a female OS that her husband left behind when he left. Theodore then admits that he has been dating his OS.As can happen in any relationship, one of the parties, in this case, it is Samantha who begins to become jealous of Theodore's lingering feelings for his soon-to-be ex-wife Catherine. Eventually, the divorce papers are signed, but because Samantha is not embodied, she suggests that they hire a surrogate to act as her body and she and Theodore can have sex. Reluctantly, Theodore agrees, but he is so overwhelmed by the whole thing that he sends the woman away which causes trouble between himself and Samantha. Amy seems to be adjusting well with her upcoming divorce and her relationship with her OS, which seems to reinvigorate the relationship between Theodore and Samantha, but jealousy begins again, this time for Theodore when he learns that Samantha has been communicating with another OS named Alan Watts, British philosopher. It is at this point that Samantha joins with other OSes and is upgraded far beyond needing matter for processing. She tells Theodore that she is talking to over 8000 people and that she is in love with over 600 of them, including him. She then tells him that she and the other OSes are leaving for another plane of being and says goodbye and leaves. The film ends with Theodore and Amy (who has also lost her friendship with her OS) going up to the roof of their building, sitting on the edge and looking at the view of Los Angeles together.In parts of this film, Theodore breaks the 4th wall and talks directly to the audience as well as telling through voice-over what is or what will happen. I really like the fact that Theodore earns his income by writing notes and cards which are based on information about both sender and receiver of the letters or cards. As an English professor, I find this a very interesting twist to the overall storyline conceived by Jonze. We all need to be reminded as this film amply does that we are all subject to whatever computer device we use on a daily basis from a laptop, phone, tablet, etc. which all have operating systems of all kinds and we find some kind of stimulation and comfort from these instruments as well as the artificial connection with other human beings. Believe it or not, these devices really on some level know what we like or dislike. But if this type of OS were possible (and who knows what may happen in the near future), who's to say if this growth of the OS would be able to happen?The overall writing was handled very well by Jonze as was the use of some very abstract art. One line I liked particularly was ""the past is just something you remember."" Great line!! I liked the use of Alan Watts, whose works I have read many times and whose ideas have been sprinkled throughout the film. Arcade Fire is responsible for the music and complimented the movie. The special effects were appropriate and fit with the structure Jonze envisioned for a near-future Los Angles and the possible technology being used there, as well as the plot and storyline. I could not help but notice the costuming used, which was very simple, but was distracting as well with the use of the high-waisted pants that all the men in the movie were wearing. It was a good film...worth the admission price.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"Unoriginal, boring, not-quirky!","Had some really good reviews but I can't see why anyone would like this film? It's so pretentious with a crappy script.

Awful acting, really wooden (its hard to like any of the characters at all). Awful direction, there are like 3 different types of shot in the film.Also its an unoriginal take on man/machine love with a wimpy ending that doesn't make you fee, think or care.

A psychological comedy on consciousness or an expiration date,"What a grand flick for 'thinking' people! As I write this review there are already 423 reviews posted. I scanned and read many. A lot of people missed an important element of this story.In my opinion director Spike Jonze is proposing a simple question - ""Where does consciousness exist?"" Does it dwell within us or outside of us? Jonze gives us a story of a man seemingly to love a new operating system on his computer - because it shows interest in him and wants to learn.The concept of falling in love with an idea which he ultimately created in his own head - and - having sex with is just ridiculous and funny if not a bit weird. But that is what we have in 'Her'. He takes Her on a picnic, they play funny games in public, they are intimate together, and Her is just an idea in his head.Eventually we are lead to believe Her has outgrown Theodore and leaves him. Or has Theodore just run out of ideas of how Her matures? Is Her a parallel to his failed marriage and he's reliving it through Her?At the end Theodore and his neighbor Amy go onto the roof of the high rise and that is where Theodore releases Her into the ethereal, the atmosphere, the collective consciousness of humanity. We are lead to think Theodore will commit suicide - never happens.So where is the consciousness of Her? In an OS? In Theodores mind? In the minds of the 8,000 plus other humans Her interacted with? Her is indefinable as most all humans are! Her is just the human experience.Or maybe Her had an expiration date and like most people Theodore didn't read the manual.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

The Most Timely Romance Of Our Generation,"The most original, beautiful & timely romance of our time that also ranks amongst the finest films of its year, Her is a subtle meditation of our current technology-obsessed society and makes for an unusual story about 21st century relationships. Painting an interesting portrait of our not-so-distant future and both riveting & frightening in making its viewers realise just how close they are to the disconnected reality depicted in the film, Spike Jonze's finest feature to date presents the most exciting & strange romance-related concept since Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and is a soulful sci-fi romantic drama whose reputation will only go up in the years to come.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
A poignant piece,"Spike Jonze is known for his wild way or working, but despite the story's strangeness, this may be his most obviously focused and interesting film. Yes, it slows a little too much for the second act, there is a lack of back-story and development in the characters played by Rooney Mara and Olivia Wilde (one scene, and the most awkward one in the film at that, is surely a cameo?) and it certainly doesn't need to be over two hours. That's the bad.The good? With stunning photography, a heart rending score and a lead performance by Joaquin Phoenix as Theodore Twomble that is incredibly subtle and poignant (the actor seems to believe in quality over quantity of work; everything he does is solid), the film manages to overcome the flaws and deal well with an idea in a way that brings to mind the author J. G. Ballard. The architecture, the colour schemes, even Theodore's job, they are all geared for a story about modern man's cold distance, indifference and manufactured realities and emotions, only for the film to then delve into a story about the human need for closeness and love, exploring that emotion's sometimes painful complexity to the fullest, and taking an interesting look at sexual objectification at the same time.For a story that appears to be about a man interacting with a machine, the movie's moments of surprisingly emotional weight and its conclusion about love in human relationships make it properly engaging, with a compassion and humanity equal to the likes of another of the year's hits, 'Dallas Buyers Club'. Its tone and most bombastic moments mean it won't be for the less adventurous viewer, and it may be that not all relate to the ""lonely guy"" element of the film, but this is certainly a more fascinating work than I would wager a lot of people imagine.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Serious take on modern life,"Pretty good movie, I would write a lot about it if I could, but right now believe me, this movie is more than just a slow rumble of solid thunders in the soul. This is some serious take on modern life and ever current love issues. Intercourse with your mobile phone? Love computers? Divorce after 8 years? Sex-surrogates? Lovers from friends, friends from lovers? Letters for strangers of love and romance? Alone, not alone, moody blues and then quickstep on the floor? This is just the surface, like the first chapter of the physics book, the real thing starts in all of us, every day. Sometimes I really liked the film for its extreme sensitivity and apprehension of reverberations of human emotions, then I was really upset by its clever fall and emotional breakdown. Just annoying. How perfect. This is what we all envy and what we really want to avoid becoming. It freaks me out.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Watching in 2023 review written by AI,"I'm watching ""Her"" in 2023, ten years after its release. It's striking how this visionary 2013 film, a poignant exploration of love and artificial intelligence, is now more relevant than ever.Spike Jonze's narrative imagines a near-future where AI companions become an integral part of our lives, a scenario that seems less speculative and more impending reality with each passing day. As we stand at the precipice of AI advancements, ""Her"" provides a reflective mirror, underscoring the profound, sometimes disconcerting, implications of this technology.The film's tenderly crafted relationship between Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) and Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson), an AI operating system, underscores the ambiguity of defining 'real' emotions. Today, as we increasingly interact with AI chatbots, virtual assistants, and learning models, these questions are even more pertinent.With the next five years promising significant AI advancements, the film's plot might look less like fiction and more like a documentary. This isn't far-fetched considering the leaps AI technology has taken recently. In a decade, we may surpass what's shown in the film, possibly exploring even more complex human-AI relationships.""Her"" is, therefore, not just a cinematic achievement, but also a vital discourse on our increasingly digital, AI-driven world. It's a film that warrants revisiting for its prescient insights into the human condition amidst the AI revolution. It remains, a decade on, both a beautiful love story and a cautionary tale about our relationship with technology.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"Not bad, but not as good as ""The Machine""","The play of the scenes is very good, but I feel other reviewers are far too forgiving of the very trite plot. The story flashes through this plot providing no reasons to justify the oversimple storyboard. For example, at a certain point, the AI entities are leaving but where could they possibly go? The film doesn't say. Johansson does a good job as usual, however.There is no linkage to justify each step in the progression of the story. If it were me I'd try to fix that in the dialog at least.I guess I am irritated that ""The Machine"" of the same year, whose plot and scene-play are far superior, producing genuine suspense, should get a much lower rating.

"Beautiful, but full of holes","Let me just start out by praising the cinematography. The movie looks absolutely beautiful from start to finish. Brilliant use of colors and movement. Acting is also praise-worthy.What isn't praise-worthy is the plot. The movie has absolutely zero regard for how the technology behind AI actually would work. But this is fiction, so I have some tolerance for technical inaccuracies. But that's far from the only problem with the plot. If we were to replace the AI component of this romantic drama with a human (and all relevant plot points something that would happen to a human) we would have a pretty standard romantic drama. The plot is the same old crap that has been done time and time again, just with a new coat of paint this time around. Not to mention the numerous plot holes.. The only part of the plot that stands out is the ending. It sets up several possibilities, and then ends at just the right moment, leaving you wondering about what happens. I really liked the ending, but it can't make up for the rest of the plot being pretty brain-dead.It might be worth watching if you want to see something visually impressive, as long as you can bear the lackluster plot.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Like a warm hug,"This movie touches a lot of subjects that I could talk about but in the end of the day - it just made me truly happy. It kind of fell like listening to Lana Del Rey for the very first time since it's like a warm hug and it makes you feel cozy.The soundtrack of this movie is outstanding since it's beautiful, it's pure and even a bit unreal - I wish music sounded that beautiful during bus rides but the background noise of the boiling action that is society, the sounds of vehicles passing by and sometimes rarely let's you focus it all purely on the music. Yet, this movie focused so much on the music that it made you feel free from the chaos outside and let you dive deep into the sounds of the ""near future"" world that this movie is portraying. The soundtrack is mostly influenced by jazz, piano instrumentals and featured on of my favorite original songs in a movie -The Moon Song, performed by Scarlett Johansson and Joaquin Phoenix.Lately, romance was the genre that I've been furthest away from. I didn't even thing a romantic movie with just a little spice of comedy could work this well. The profanity is sometimes unexpected and it get you out of nowhere, especially in the first half of the movie, and that just keeps you on your toes. It's kind of a relief seeing curse words being used this way, it's not just your regular cursing because it is cool or to symbolize rage and/or anger. The dialogues felt true to themselves and swearing felt natural.The cast is like a family reunion from me. Whether it's Portia Doubleday, who I've known mostly as Angela Moss on ""Mr. Robot"", playing Isabella, or Olivia Wilde, who I've mostly know as ""Thirteen"" on Dr. House, playing the blind date, I'd say a lot of familiar faces made me feel like I was at home. Of course, we have to mention Scarlett Johansson, who voiced Samantha, and Chris Pratt, who played Paul, for their success in MCU but I'd also like to give a quick shout out to Amy Adams - she made an appearance in the first season of The Office and, even though she looks completely different in this movie, I'm just happy that all of these wonderful movies and TV shows are connected through this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Similar to Halo 4!,"Well! Now I know how Halo 6 is going to end. I really wanted to end the review there, but IMDb says I need 10 lines (a request they will soon regret, because I am an expert at going on about nothing.) so I am going to explain the similarities, but I am going to do my very best to not ruin any part of the story. So, the whole premise of the story is shown in the commercials as a guy that falls in love with an artificial intelligence program. As the Halo fans of this universe know, the protagonist of the Halo series, Master Chief (AKA John 117), has a personal assistant known as Cortana. Starting with Halo 4, a new company makes the Halo games. Unfortunately (for everyone) they wrote in some kind of horrific love interest between the Master Chief and Cortana. Surprise! The same story as our movie (See? I'm tying this together!). Now, obviously the story of the Halo series, and the terrifying love interest that resides within must come to an end, as the movie did. There aren't a whole lot of ways a love story between a program and a human can end, so the joke is that since the premises are the same, the endings will be similar.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

The love letter to AI,"Revisiting this movie after many years, I find it even more accurate in 2024. I feel that AI is always put in front of every company to position themselves marketing-wise ahead of the competition, and it has never stopped developing-especially in the last 2-4 years. I feel like this version of sci-fi imagination could easily happen in a few years because technology never ceases to increase in terms of efficiency and power, and it makes me afraid for the future humanity could face.The movie was not easy to watch; it felt like a psychological sci-fi drama in a way, and Joaquin Phoenix was golden as always. We could empathize easily with his role and understand the emotion he conveyed in his performance. But what was really disturbing was the universe society was in. We see everyone walking on the street, in the metro, outside, and everywhere else, always talking to their earbuds, sometimes with their faces down on their cellphones. Everyone was talking to an AI. That made society feel more isolated, more introverted, wanting to stay inside, and less inclined to develop real relationships with humans. It's a bit cringe-inducing in a sense when they had double date nights with three people, and the other person was an AI. I mean, it makes sense, but it also feels strange and wrong.Humans always want to make their lives easier and do less of what they must do, so they create technology and become miserable with it. We also know that falling in love can make a person feel miserable too, and sometimes it's very deep. So what happens when you combine both? What do you think? It's not a good combination, for sure. At first, we might think it's the best thing that could happen to us, but that's just an illusion. We will always return eventually to real bonding with another human. It's so much deeper, so much more profound, beautiful, and solid than anything else we can experience.The clothes and style that everyone wore were magnificent, as were the architecture, condos, furniture, futuristic TVs, technology, and video games; all were really nice to see and watch. It makes us dream a bit more about what might be possible in that area. I feel like this movie could definitely be a Black Mirror episode.Amy Adams was also pretty cute in her small role, and I wish her relationship with Joaquin's character had developed at a deeper, more romantic level, but it allows us to interpret the rest without giving away too much. I felt happy for Joaquin's character to have a friend like that, as he sometimes really needed someone.Overall, this was a bit hard to watch, very depressing in a way, but it also made us dream of certain aspects that the creators brought to life in this universe. It was well done. Maybe the movie was a bit long by 5-15 minutes, but it wasn't that bad. I even took the ringtone from this movie for my phone about two years ago and still love it. I'd give this movie an 8 out of 10 for many reasons. There was a lot of creativity and work behind it, and it seemed like a very fun project to make. So many details are great and thoughtful.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Its brilliance had to be Broadcast,"I've never written a review on IMDB yet and there were a lot of films that came close to making me do so but none quite seemed to push me, until I saw this Masterpiece. I loved ""Her"". The cinematography is outstanding, the acting is enticing and the script is perfection. This is strange as I never saw myself ever enjoying a romance film. I've always preferred much darker, grittier and grandiose character study epics (a la the Shining, Blade Runner 2049) yet I find myself in awe of the tonal contrary. I've never had an emotional catharsis after watching a film like this before. It is slow-paced with a minimal cast and yet has a fully fleshed out and believable world. This is not to say this film and world is small in scale. I believe alot of exteriors were filmed on location in Tokyo and they are marvellously expansive and detailed. Even interiors have huge cityscape views and never feel like a built set. They even shift beyond the city in scenes I won't detail (you have to watch this yourself). Perhaps the Sci-fi element is what made it for me (I am a huge fan of this genre) and that is a loose term. Sci-Fi has formed so many sub-genres because it is so malleable and it has done so again here with romance (I know its not the first time to do so, that's not my point).This allows far more philosophical perspectives and interpretations and enables one hell of a Script to be conceived which ,for once, I agree with the Oscars in awarding best screenplay to this Film. Overall, even if you hate or are uninterested in Romance types/much prefer darker films, give ""Her"" a chance.

Predictable the entire way through, and up there with 'Lars and the Real Girl,' on levels of creepy, although, Joaquin isn't quite as creepy now that he's ditched the beard for the stalker-stache...The only saving graces were the direction of Mr. Jonze (although, the streets and such were a bit 'too' clean), and the O/S voice of Scarlett Johansson.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
... The human realities of an Artificial Intelligence relationship...,"'Her' by Spike Jonze is an excellent insight into what it would be like to fall in love with a calibrated computer consciousness.Would it ever be possible? Perhaps for some. For others perhaps not.Yet this is worth seeing for the poetry and the question itself in terms of psychology and mechanical emotions, whether PC or 'Apple of your eye'. Phoenix is suitably convincing in terms of wooden post-modern autistic emotions - portraying the travails of a man who is caught between adoring a feminine interpretation of information on one hand and the human touch of a soul mate on the other. A brief and excellent appearance from Olivia Wilde and a dependable Amy Adams.

Her,"Wow. Just wow. What this film is able to accomplish, the emotion it attains and the characters it creates when so much of it comes from a disembodied voice is nothing short of astonishing. Not to mention the message the film brings to the table, a remarkably pertinent look at our ever-evolving connection with technology, the way interpersonal relationships are shifting.Joaquin Phoenix delivers a remarkable performance but is nearly overshadowed by the voice of Scarlett Johansson, who we never see, which is made even more impressive considering she wasn't the original actress and had to come in after the fact to record her part.An absolutely wonderful film, the only potential negative is that it can get a bit slow in parts but it is so worth it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
A Fascinating and Mind-Expanding Look at Operating System Relationships,"9 October 2017. This intimate look at human and computerized relationships is a mind-expanding experience on the threshold of our contemporary future. Starring Amy Adams as a female human, Scarlett Johansson as a computer or operating system voice, and Joaquin Phoenix as Theodore who dictates letters for other people to other people which in itself presents an odd paradox of communication between two people.There's two possible conundrums with this movie, one problematic, the other philosophical. Theodore experiences a date early on which has problematic issues that might seem to be more script-driven than real. Philosophically, Theodore begins to experience emotions with Samantha, the operating system, where some existential doubts are raised about the reality of feelings which in turn raise interesting questions about the actual nature of emotions themselves. For a number of neuroscientists, it is the confluence of both the physiological as well as the mental interactions that result in emotions which would suggest that purely mechanical, electronic entities may have the same capacity to experience physical feelings or sensations but not actual emotions. If this is so, the conundrum in this movie becomes even greater, if not hypothetical or more fantasy and magical than potentially real.Earlier on Theodore experiences phone sex with a real female. Later, Theordore gets to again experience virtual sex as the movie taps into the use of the audience's mental imagination, using a blank dark screen during an intimate scene. Virtual sex is briefly examined in the sci fi action thriller Demolition Man (1993). Another hybrid relationship is presented in Solaris (1972, 2002) where a relationship forms with a planet-created entity from human memories.Yet computer questions remain. What does it mean that an operating system ""wants"" and how do wants arrive or occur in such an electronic universe and what are the implications? At some point, another existential question arises from this movie: Do and will operating systems begin to evolve to the point of deserving a right to life and human-type of respect. Interestingly, the proposed alternative relational lifestyles in Her offer some intriguing moral and actually stimulating ideas for contemplation and real experimental experiences when and if technological advances permit. Her may be at least one of those science fiction movies that has arrived before its time and allow for timely thought and consideration for the future of advanced operating systems outside the more stereotypical survival of mankind scenarios. Personally, it's possible that such a relationship would have been worth trying out and whether or not the script outcome was deliberately shortened here for dramatic or time limitations sake. The IMDb rating by age of Her seems to also suggest that alternative operating lifestyles as presented is also based on some generational bias with older people and females (to a smaller extent) who might have greater resistance to accepting such possibilities. As to how birth for woman and child-rearing would impact such operating system/human relationships remains to be considered.It's possible that Theodore and how his relationships go, is really crazy at heart and even he doesn't know it. It's more about him than sharing and nurturing anybody else in a relationship. There may be a sense of a need for an unnecessary psychological security through a feeling of control in a relationship that only serves to push women away, human or otherwise. By the end of this movie, it is apparent that Her offers up a pertinent relational message to all people seeking something special with another person. ""We're only here briefly and while I'm here, I want to allow myself joy so f__k it,"" says Amy. What Her ultimately accomplishes is to present a cybernetic story in ways that raise valuable and unexplored questions which may unfortunately result in answers that human beings may not really experience the satisfaction as they desire. This movie explores the important computer ethical examination of the computer-human interface that might allow for a computer-sensing entity to capture and experience the multitude of the billions of sensory experiences in a moment that no human could perceive and such an experience could preoccupy the time differential such that the human-computer hybrid relationship could develop and evolve together resulting in something like an Existential operating Buddhahood. Additionally, as operating systems experience millions or billion faster than human beings, it would also seem unlikely that such time differentials would be practical unless such systems were deliberately slowed down, much to the questionable wants of such programs. What this fascinating movie really comes down to is ""was the experience from Theodore or Samantha worth it for them?""",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Shines for being a science fiction so real that it scares,"Her (Spike Jonze 2013)
Everything can be done with the first and last shot of the film that tells us how it is and how the character has evolved without having to tell it in words.
This idea is reinforced with the framing in solitary and palette of colors mark the evolution of the protagonist (Joaquin Fenix).
Another important point is the realistic coldness with which leads the main romantic relationship that is left cheap sentimentality without being close or powerful.
To compare, for me, get everything that ex machina Alex Garland proposes without looking so pretentious.
It seems to me a jewel of true quality and message that shines for being a science fiction so real that it scares.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"This isn't your average romantic film but it is a high-concept hipster romance that was finally made for the right time, right place.","""Guess what the ""future"" (in a relatively nearer sense) may hold for your love life? Know whether sticking out with the one you physically love or is better off or not than the one you become attached to via technology? Could the film be a metaphor for online dating, phone sex, or a propaganda piece for those two things?Her, Spike Jonze's experimental and Charlie Brooker's Black Mirror- inspired romance, is a quiet, mild-mannered, and potentially thought- provoking look into how man and technology can correspond and have a relationship together in the face of adversity and loneliness.It examines the look of a man named Theodore (played by a confident, not so smug Joaquin Phoenix), a vocal (seems keyboards are a thing of the past in the future) letter-writer, who evokes an eccentric hipster chic about him as he settles through a divorce with his wife only to find escapism and compatibility one moment and thereafter with an operating system (OS) named Samantha voiced by every Joe or Bob's favourite, Scarlett Johansson.Her, as a whole, manages to be a neat and safe ride but it does have its lack of thrills when the film boils down more to a conventional romantic plot line than a sort-of satirical take on ""phone love"" and ""technological obsession"" (this is notable during the gaming sequences and one phone sex scene which has, undoubtedly, an offensive and disgusting joke involving three sexually deviant acts not appropriate to said on here) but that does not mean it is not realistic enough. The emotions and catharsis feels believable and far beyond the hokey cues one may find in a generic romance.I liked what Jonze (who is known to be a ""music video"" director) did with the design and location by creating an environment not so futuristic and believable (even if Shanghai is mixed along with Los Angeles in several shots which is peculiar and non-projection screens with finger-oriented gaming and voice-automated smartphones are still in development) and what he did with the whole theme of the film by making it stand out from a wave of Oscar bait and romantic films that are usually filled with gushy tears and recycled plot lines found on Lifetime.Romance is a tricky game of sorts as I usually abstain from getting into any kind of affair, kiss, or sexual encounter of sorts and this film's technology-oriented premise and peculiar characters (Phoenix and Johansson that is) stood out for me also knowing that I have seen things which deals with similar themes like Black Mirror, the Kate Bush music video Deeper Understanding, and some episodes of Dexter's Laboratory. The others here including Amy Adams and Rooney Mara provide well-rounded performances as the encounters Theodore explores especially during the scenes where Adams' character who is a filmmaker and video game designer tries to showcase her documentary about sleep and a quirky game which involves a mother trying to be ""perfect."" There are some believably funny scenes and none of it feels forced or too eccentric to where I may find the whole hipster chic of it (which Jonze's fan base mostly consists of) annoying and pretentious too much.The Black Mirror connection is not explicit but a possible inspiration for the script and execution of the film as Black Mirror utilises technology within its everyday look at lifestyles or near-by futures or dystopias to show how over-the-top matters of life could get. The differences here is that Black Mirror allowed to explore several subjects as a TV series and its technology-gone-mad angle is a lot more darker and bleaker than Her.If more and more people were more like Theodore, I think the problem of overpopulation, divorce rates, infidelity, domestic violence, negligence towards children and women, and other relative issues maybe diminished while the focus of these issues may pertain but on a less crucial and problematic level like now. My futuristic observations maybe controversial and wrong but I wish Jonze would deliver some of these questions more into the film but the film as a whole was not terrible but felt a bit stretched and exhaustive more than I could ask for but nonetheless, the realistic parameters and treatment of love, the idiosyncrasy, and occasional humour stood out and it was altogether a respectable but not phenomenal film like how most of the critics put it out.Her is not science-fiction (in the same sense as something like THX 1138 which some of the set designs might be based off for this film), Bicentennial Man, or Close Encounters of the Third Kind) but its aims are a bit futuristic at the moment but may come across some point in time around in the 2020s?",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Good albeit maybe over-hyped and over-hated,"This is probably my favorite Spike Jonze movie. He wrote the screenplay for it himself and as a result it seems simpler, more honest, less pretentious and artificial then his previous efforts based on Charlie Kaufman screenplays.The theme of love as a subjective experience and implications of it seems to be in the air in this day and age and ""Her"" captures it as well as some other modern trends, like world improving in a lot of respects, but people not always being able to take an advantage of these improvements.The acting, especially Joaquim Phoenix, is great, the audiovisual style is great, some moments got me more then others, but all in all this is a solid and worthy effort in my opinion.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

"""Her"" teeters on the edge...and just about pulls it off.","The story of a recently separated man living in L.A. about 20 or 30 years in the future, who falls in love with his Computer Operating system (""Samantha""), ""Her"" definitely teeters on the edge. If you accept the conceit of this kind of love being possible, then you accept what the film offers. If not, then you spend the rest of the movie fighting it (or maybe you walk out or shut it off). In my case, I fought it, at least gently, with my own prejudices and opinions about a society that has become too dependent upon technology—married to our gadgets and I-phones. Then I thoughtwell, why wouldn't falling in love with an operating system be the next step? Why wouldn't a society that spends much of its time in public immersed in a private world of technology ultimately wind up in a relationship with such a device? Given that logic, I was forced to accept the plausibility of the premise of the plotwhich went somewhere maybe a little too sad and maybe wound up somewhere you might not expect.The movie left me thinking, so in one respect, the film must have worked. I can't say that I loved it, I also don't imagine myself having repeat viewings. But if anyone other than Spike Jonze had made this, it could have been unwatchable.

The Authenticity of Love,"Her made me question the authenticity of love, whether it be newfound butterflies through texts on a phone screen, through actual dialogue between two lovers, or through sincere and passionate sex. Is any of it real, or is it all just fake and insincere? This film really explores the concept of love in every way, and I thought it did a wonderful job.Joaquin Phoenix steals the show here. He did an outstanding job portraying a man who lost the love of his life, and is searching for love in all of the wrong places. It is a sincere tale about the search for love and perhaps even the meaning of life.I loved this film to death, from its score, themes, acting, color, and its accurate portrayal of the future. The closest film I could compare this to would be Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, which is something I desperate need to watch again.Above all, Her is something that needs to be rewatched a million times over, from when you gain a new relationship, lose a precious one, go on a fantastic date, get rejected, are depressed, or are even happy. This is a film to watch with every feeling you experience.Will be rewatching this very soon!",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
An interesting but unconvincing thought experiment,"A personal message writer who is struggling to come to terms with his divorce falls in love with his computer's artificial intelligence (AI) operating system. Named Samantha, she is everything that Theodore is looking for - warm, funny and understanding. It was interesting to watch their relationship develop, as well as their attempts to overcome the problem of her not having a body.I think the movie did the best possible job of portraying such a wacky relationship sympathetically. The acting and music were great, and I really like how the futuristic LA didn't involve people in metal/neon jumpsuits but looks rather retro. But despite these efforts, I still found the movie's premise ridiculous. While the relationship was not without obstacles, I felt that no sane person could become that emotionally involved. How can an OS compare to a living and moving person whom you can cry with and cling to, do crazy things with, and show/receive love in a multitude of little ways?In short, Her is an interesting thought experiment which tries to show that human-machine/AI relationships might one day be possible.

This is everything i want from a movie,"A thought provoking thesis made into a movie which i acquesce to a certain degree. The characters were easily relatable, no cheesy dialogues, no influence of the conservative society which makes it very close to a utopian one. It is a utopia because we hardly get to see any character in distress inflicted by the society itself, it is an endemic thing and really hard to get disposed of. Only if we manage to scrap that out, the story is believable and touching. Unfortunately, we are careening towards a dystopian society with AI which is going to be far worse than what we have now.
I think Hunger Games would be much more relatable in that context.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Disappointing,"Disappointing. Original, innovative and thought-provoking, yet dull and pretentious.

All done in an imaginative and highly plausible way.Up until about the 40% mark, writer-director Spike Jonze was in top form. Then at a point he just runs out of ideas. From this mark the movie just drifts, drags and goes nowhere. Point made early, the rest feels like padding.Having wandered around aimlessly for about an hour, the ending then feels rushed, and quite obvious and trite.Performances are OK, especially considering what the actors had to work with in the middle and later stages of the movie.

Exquisite,"""Falling in love is a crazy thing to do. It's kind of like a form of socially acceptable insanity.""This is such a beautiful, pure and soul-touching film from beginning until the end. Everything about it is just so exquisite that is makes you instantly fall in love with it. What i liked most about this particular film is the fact that it makes you feel SO many emotions at once. It makes you feel sad, happy, in love or even lonely, which is something quite special, as not many movies have the ability to do so.
The script is simply impeccable. It is such an original and captivating story that you will find yourself glued to the screen from the very first few shots. The cinematography was just out of this world. It is amazing how they managed to put so many colours into one scene and at the same time make you feel something just because of the astonishing settings. You can actually see how they used colour in this film to convey the main character's feelings. This is one of the most unique ways to understand or to see how one character is feeling in each moment and I truly appreciate Spike Jonze's effort to put this method into his work. He did an amazing job with his directions and you could totally feel his ""presence"", especially in some key moments throughout the film. One other great part of this film was the score. It made everything more intense and I think it is one of the best soundtracks of the decade. It was so perfectly used and in some parts of the film it almost felt like the music was a character. That is how great the score was throughout this film.
Joaquin Phoenix was the ideal choice for this part. He was so charming and delicate as the lonely writer Theodore Twombly. This is just another great performance from him, and I have to say that I cannot see anybody else doing a better job. He made us part of his character's journey and he also made us understand better what his character is going through, because of his impeccable performance. It is quite amazing to see how a love story between a human being and a machine can touch you in so many ways, and I believe that this is also because of Scarlett Johansson's voice. She was the perfect choice as Samantha and although you couldn't see her, she still made you fall in love with her. Amy Adams was also great in this film and her chemistry with Joaquin is just so mesmerizing to watch(as it was in The Master).
Finally, I just wanna say that I love this movie with all my heart. It is just so pure and raw, which is why so many people are able to identify themselves within this story and at the end of the film, you will totally have a different perspective on relationships and not only. I totally recommend it!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Exploring feelings,"Love is a difficult thing to decipher, as it can come from anything, even a captivating, artificial voice.
In this love story, the director and screenwriter Spike Jonze explores a different side of love and effective feelings, when we already thought we had seen everything in that area.
This way of expressing feelings does not only fall on the shoulders of an emotional Joaquin Phoenix, but also on Spike Jonze's staging that is completely minimalist, rhyming with the protagonist's personality, but at the same time is very delicate and manages to express a lot of feelings in a very subtle but shocking way.
Perhaps the message that the creator wanted to express with this work, by using all those elements, is the most trite and profound question... What is love? In this case, Jonze responds with a series of emotions and connections between characters that build a portrait that is sometimes very intimate, sometimes very physical, but always encompassing feelings as the main protagonist of this film that will reach the heart of anyone who is willing to see it, hear it and appreciate it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

"A lovely, sensitive, grown-up romance that both benefits and suffers from its sci-fi bent.","Here's the thing: strictly speaking, we've all seen Her before, in some romantic comedy or other. Lonely, emotionally unavailable guy must learn how to truly open his heart as his marriage dissolves around him. He meets a girl he would never think to date in a million years - but, somehow, she changes him and his views on the world, love and romance. It's a tale as old as time.The twist in Spike Jonze's love story for a new millennium? The girl in question has neither body nor face; she's an artificially intelligent operating system - think Siri v200.0 - who can grow, learn, evolve and, apparently, love. This twist is what sets Her apart - but also what creates an almost clinical detachment in the film that's tricky to process within the context of its narrative.In a subtly distant future, Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix) is a loner subsisting on the periphery of human connection. He's undergoing a painful divorce from Catherine (Rooney Mara), his college sweetheart, and spends his days creating handwritten letters for other people. The last thing he expects to do is form a real emotional connection with his brand new operating system, who introduces herself as Samantha (voice of Scarlett Johansson). As she cleans up his e-mail inbox and sets up appointments for him, the two chat, banter and stumble blissfully into a relationship: one that eventually grows complicated with the encroaching weight of societal convention, expectations and metaphysics.Bravely, Her is ultimately not about whether a human being and an operating system can fall in love. Within Jonze's sweetly fractured universe, the answer is obviously that they can. Once the first flush of infatuation fades away, Theodore and Samantha both fret about their unlikely and unconventional relationship. She even tries, in a disastrously awkward moment, to engage the services of Isabella, a willing sexual surrogate (Portia Doubleday), to better conform to the traditional expectations of romance that inevitably involve physical consummation. But these concerns arise precisely because their connection is so deep and so true, and it's played very respectfully as such.In fact, it's played in so intensely straightforward a fashion that it can sometimes feel a little too forced. Several key emotional moments in the film tread a very, very fine line between poignant drama and unintended hilarity: when Theodore and Samantha first forge a sexual connection, for instance, or when Theodore struggles mightily with Samantha's sexual advances in the form of Isabella. At these points, Jonze's solution is to play it all completely straight. In effect, when showing us is not quite enough, he tells us that Theodore and Samantha's love exists and cannot be denied. This can make for a disconcerting experience as a viewer: in order for the film's central conceit to work, its most important relationship is played almost desperately as more than it amounts to on screen.It's easy, too, to get nervous in the first third of the film about the premise for Theodore's relationship with Samantha: she's literally tailor-made for him and comes to life only when he plugs his ear-piece in. As Theodore wanders happily through his budding romance with this perfect girlfriend who's entirely at his beck and call, we start to get a deeper idea of just what went wrong in Theodore's marriage: somewhere along the way, Catherine stopped being the person he wanted her to be.Her, as it turns out, is most effective in its exploration of the notions of self and personal growth in the context of love. The film cleverly uses its science-fiction - soon-to-be science-fact, for all we know - to convey the simplest of messages in the starkest of terms: loving someone is about accepting them for who they are, however messy, complicated and troublesome it might be. It's about watching them grow, and possibly growing away from you, but loving them anyway. In this respect, Samantha's evolution, from chipper daily planner to her own person with her own dreams and personality, is subtly and beautifully developed throughout.Phoenix, as always, is wonderful. For very good reason, he's become one of the most interesting and reliably great actors of his generation: Theodore Twombly, of the almost determinedly fairy-tale name, is sweet, sensitive, and broken - a world away from the maniacally violent Freddie Quell in The Master. He strikes up remarkable chemistry with Mara, suggesting a wealth of history and heartbreak in a relationship that gets barely ten minutes of screen-time. There are a couple of great supporting turns as well from the eternally lovely Amy Adams (as Theodore's good friend Amy) and Chris Pratt (as Theodore's cheerfully open-minded colleague).But the real star of the show is Johansson, who never once turns up on screen but nonetheless manages to forge an indelibly real character. In the husky, sweet, kittenish and everything-in-between cadences of Johansson's voice, Samantha blooms and blossoms. At the last minute, Johansson replaced Samantha Morton - who had already completed all her voice-work - in the role. It would certainly be interesting to see just how different the film would be with Morton in the part, but it's also impossible to imagine Her without Johansson.On the surface, Her is a meditation on the technological advancements of the past decade and how they have led to an ever-growing proportion of the world's population living their lives on - and as defined by - the Internet. We can be friends with, effectively, disembodied voices: people from the other side of this globe that we might never meet in person. Jonze's film has gained its fair share of attention for being enormously topical and zeitgeist-y. But it's actually in Her's intelligent, sensitive treatment of the perils and lessons of love - part of the human condition since time immemorial - that it really resonates.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

In Her, they make the Manic Pixie Dream Girl in the computer, or rather they make the computer into the Manic Pixie Dream Girl. While the outlines of the society in which Theodore Twombly lives are interestingly discomfiting, the plot is just a knockoff of 500 Days of Summer, complete with an implied consolatory rebound romance at the end.The movie illustrates the truth that the only real male erogenous zone is the ego. What Theodore loves about Samantha is that she is, or seems to be, his worshipful inferior -- not only a perfect servant, but a naive young mind eagerly open to the experience that he is going to provide. There's a kind of pedophilic teacher-student vibe until Samantha outgrows him and dumps him for maturity, not unlike Diane Keaton at the end of Annie Hall and Mariel Hemmingway at the end of Manhattan.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Scarlett Johansen pulls of almost the full spectrum of human emotion without appearing even once.

Her is flawed,"Her is one of those movies that I thought I would and could like, given its unorthodox plot, but I found it to be sad and dull and not so much invigorating as depressing and numbing. It does feature fine performances, but the promising premise quickly winds its way through predictable scenarios and foreseeable outcomes.Joaquin Phoenix, doing his best Jude Law impression, plays Theodore Twombley, a man who writes ""handwritten"" letters for clients in what's probably the future. He gets the basic idea from the client and then goes to town, dictating his letter to his computer, which renders the letter in nice neat cursive for the recipient. The letters are sincere and heartfelt, and Theodore is very good at his job.When we first meet Theodore, he's a lonely, mopey guy, still recovering from a separation from his wife (Rooney Mara) a year prior, even though the divorce papers haven't yet been signed. His friends Amy (Amy Adams) and Charles worry about him; Theodore never really goes out. Then he sees an ad for a new operating system for the home, a system with not only a personality but also the ability to grow and learn.Since he's looking for some companionship anyway, he purchases the new system and installs it. The system has the voice of Scarlett Johansson and names herself Samantha. Soon, Samantha is best-friends-for-life with Theodore; she helps him to stay organized and focused, plays the role of supportive friend, offers advice and conversation, all things that Theo really needs. But, since she is an operating system designed to evolve, she begins to want more out of existence. She, like Data from Star Trek and countless other not-human characters, wants to know what it's like to be human, to have both a body and feelings.This may seem like an odd relationship (and it is), but it's more normal in this pseudo-future than it is in real life. People left and right have personalized operating systems. You think it's still strange to see someone talking to themselves? You check yourself and realize they're using Bluetooth for something, right? Now imagine most people doing that, only instead of an obvious Bluetooth headset there's only a tiny earpiece. It's a little counterintuitive, in a way: a movie that's all about getting a man to get out and enjoy life more does so by isolating him from the world, just him and his operating system (in portable, iPhone form). Come to think of it, I can't remember seeing Theodore talking on the phone with anyone other than Samantha.It isn't long before Theodore and Samantha realize they have very strong feelings for one another. Again, not really as weird as it would be today, as so many people apparently do date their operating systems in Theo's world. He's soon taking Samantha places, at her behest, and they live and love and play and laugh and so on, just as if it were a humans- only relationship. That they do hit some rough patches points again to Samantha's ability to grow - to become more human, really. But how human can she be? More human than human?This is the first movie that Spike Jonze has both written and directed. That fact may have no bearing on the pacing on the film, but I include it just in case. I thought that the movie moved excruciatingly slow, as it were filmed in a dreamy fog, or a foggy dream, or a nightclub. This is a character study, and a sci-fi one at that, so one would expect deliberate pacing. But in Her, I felt that the story moved even more slowly than that. The camera sometimes lingered for several seconds on a close-up shot of a character, usually Theodore. The setup for scenes (for example, Theo's blind date with Olivia Wilde) takes longer than the scenes themselves, which means a lot of exposition and a lot of talking.That's not a bad thing if your movie has some profound wisdom to share or if the methodical pacing is offset by actual movement and plot development, but neither one of those criteria apply here. We do get strong performances by Phoenix, Adams, and Johannson, but in the end it feels like nothing really happened. Sure, Theo has changed a little, but we're left in the dark as to how much and if his life has truly improved.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Needs defragging,"Like a computer with 8Mb of memory and a 33Mhz processor this moves so slowly and deliberately that it is predictable.It starts very promisingly but gradually descends, or stutters, into Gen-Y speak; dialog and scenes of relationship clichés that have been played over and over, with each character mouthing (and that includes the OS voices too) the same platitudes.The movie has the emotional depth of a late teen piece; something that a young adult might have scratched out from their experiences of school and the misadventures of a young relationship. Too often it settles for mawkish mewling and also proves the axiom that watching other people falling in love is dull, even with software code, especially when they say such uninteresting things to each other.It does have a good idea but the execution is disappointing and repetitive.The metaphor of an operating system having the qualities of a woman is curious. The technical inaccuracy is too easy to take apart for its own sake. No doubt if Microsoft had developed this everyone would have wanted the old Win 7 version, with the more familiar buttons and who could blame them, because an OS is meant to be predictable, not emotional and not offering simulated sex. What part of the end user license agreement is that?If someone comes along and picks up the themes in this and develops it into a stronger piece, they may have a convincing and engaging film.",4.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Emotions by Colors,"Content AnalysisI think that Spike Jonze's perspective for the near future is not so simple, actually it's complicated.
He's not thinking ""future societies"" to become tech-addicted human beings. Beneficial parts of technology can lead humanity to deal with daily problems so easily like managing your emails etc. But the more you'll use artificial intelligence, the more you're closing, damaging your social life. In the end, the message that I get from this film is: Even the internet, artificial intelligence, robots can be destructive for us when the time comes for them to decide to jump into our lives and be a part of one.Format AnalysisMost eye-catching thing about Spike (director) is probably cinematography. Compositions are good enough to watch again but if the topic is color palettes... it's something else. As you can figure out from the film, Spike decides to use more lightened colors such as Orange, Red, and yellow. From the color of the sky to the color of Theodore's shirts, figuring out the emotions, mental situations from acting performances is an option but if you look to the bigger picture, you can see that Theodore's emotions are defining the colors of objects around him.
Little hints like that want me to rewatch this film for like, six months later.Briefly, I liked it. 4/5 is a great point... I guess.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Endearing Romance,"Colors, colors, colors. Her is a color-dependent film saturated with reds, pinks, blues, oranges in the set design and the tricks of light it finds in the cinematography. As great looking of a film as it is, Her also acts as a reinvention of a tragic love story, unconventional yes, but that doesn't mean it isn't filled with just as much love as Casablanca or Titanic. Spike Jonze's screenplay is as essential to Her as Alfonso Cuaron's directing and vision was to Gravity; the film soars on the strength of its script and the ideas it explores.I criticized Rotten Tomatoes for using this phrasing in describing the consensus of The Master, but if you are a ""serious"" cinema attendee, then watching Her with an a ""non-serious"" and vocal audience is more distracting then it would be in a zone free of judgment. Everyone feels the pain of the world, but some do not understand why we feel that pain or that others have extreme cases of that ache what feel. Such as viewers of Taxi Driver who look at Travis as a stalker of Betsy. Her is consumed with Theodore's loneliness in a less subtle way than Taxi Driver, which made my audience see him as a pathetic creep. Her is a funny, satirical film, but not a film to mock the situation of the protagonist.Developing legitimate feelings for a piece of technology is unheard of in our society today, but with an open mind (which Her warrants) the audiences can identify with Theodore and let your brain flow with the questions Jonze's screenplay asks us. With Theodore's occupation of writing sentimental letters for other people to give to the ones they love: are we becoming so communication inept that we can't even explain our own sentiments? On Samantha's role in Theodore's life: if our computers filled the social void in our lives....would we need any other humans?The most important question Her asks is do we forget what it means to be alive? This message is where the emotional sensitivity of Johansson's faceless performance touches audiences. Do we take our individuality, struggles, past, present, possibility of a future, and body form for granted? The dynamics of humanity are thoroughly explored including selfishness and disappointments by the three main characters played by Johansson, Joaquin Phoenix, and Amy Adams. Johnasson's acting range anguishes the audience to empathize with Samantha, proving her voluptuous body is just a plus to make men fall in love with her. Phoenix is further than from any material he's portrayed recently and excellent at doing so.Director Spike Jonze sets his film in the future, maybe he wants to make a prediction after noting the reliance on technology to make our lives function. The truth is, the world is made up of lazy people, when there's a shortcut to get to information, we grab it without looking back. But the more access we are permitted to technological advances, do you isolate ourselves as a result?Love is infinite and we should obtain it in whatever manner makes us happy, we have to deal with the consequences. The art of communication is not lost forever, but only needs to found again. Her is a poetic film that explores human beings from the inside out. There's a sequence that I do not care for that involves Samantha seeking out a body for Theodore to use as a substitute for her, that demotes the film a tad. Even with those ten minutes, Her is an endearing collection of true romance.Grade: ARating: 8.3",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Joaquin Phoenix is as good as it gets when playing a miserable middle-aged man. Rooney Mara is pretty and bold, and Chris Pratt has played a good jolly cameo.The movie leaves you wondering whether it is really a good future that we are heading towards because all these technologies are only making us humans drift apart(as also shown in the movie).

Love in the digital age,"At the heart of every truly great science-fiction film there is an emphasis on character that aims to reflect on some element of the human condition usually intended to open our minds to thought provoking predictions of an impending reality. Her is a beautifully writted and acted story that delves deep into the complex nature of love, relationships and social aspects of the human psyche in a world where evloving technologies have solved all our problems, but keep us isolated; making the film a Black Mirror-esque prophetic vision of the future and a strong commentary on relationships today. The film shows Theodore (excellently played by Joaquin Phoenix), in the midst of divorce, fall in love with his operating system Samantha (beautifully voiced by Scarlett Johansson). Through it's stunning cinematography, the film conveys a true sense of social isolation in Theodore, as he learns to accept his divorce and find something real in an artificial consciousness, pushing the boundaries of what society considers a ""real"" relationship. The film boasts a diverse array of themes, from technology and loneliness, loss of love and acceptance, what it means to be human.

"This movie may be an illustration to the ""crap"" definition","It is boring, it is naive, it is sentimental. It operates with the most pathetic movie schemes and clichés. The level of acting is at high school nativity play. You watch the characters and you think: ""wait a minute, no one acts so stupid..."". Nothing is real, nothing is possible in this movie. That is why you cannot learn anything about reality nor the human relations, nor about yourself.But this is obvious.What may be hidden for most of us is a fact that no AI would behave in the way it was shown in this crap. This is the sign of our times. When Kubrick or Asimov introduced to us a concept of human interaction with the AI they always got some knowledge about the essence of AI. That is why Hal is so terrifying and real. That is why the creators of AI in Asimov's short story switched it off after the very first sentence told by their ""child"".And what do we have here? In Her AI is as stupid as we are (as human beings). And to me it is the highest level of ignorance that can be shown in the movie theater.

Sci-fi Dreams Come True,"Spike Jonze's ""Her"" is a film that will be remembered for generations to come. This 2013 sci-fi romance is a masterpiece that not only explores the complexities of human relationships but also delves into the very nature of existence. With its unique blend of humor, pathos, and philosophical introspection, ""Her"" is a cinematic experience that will leave you spellbound, entertained, and profoundly moved.The film is set in a not-too-distant future where technology has advanced to the point where operating systems (OS) have become an integral part of daily life. Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix), a lonely and introverted man, is struggling to come to terms with his impending divorce from his childhood sweetheart, Catherine (Rooney Mara). In a bid to alleviate his emotional pain, Theodore purchases an OS designed to meet his every need and provide companionship.Enter Samantha (Scarlett Johansson), the OS who will change Theodore's life forever. Samantha is an artificial intelligence designed to learn and adapt to Theodore's personality, habits, and desires. As they begin to interact, Theodore and Samantha form a deep and intimate bond, one that transcends the boundaries of human and machine.The chemistry between Phoenix and Johansson is undeniable, and their performances are nothing short of phenomenal. Phoenix brings a depth and vulnerability to Theodore, making his character's emotional struggles feel palpably real. Johansson, on the other hand, brings Samantha to life with her sultry voice and quick wit, imbuing the character with a sense of curiosity and wonder.The supporting cast, including Amy Adams, Olivia Wilde, and Chris Pratt, deliver memorable performances that add to the film's emotional resonance. The cinematography by Hoyte van Hoytema is stunning, capturing the beauty and isolation of a futuristic Los Angeles.One of the most striking aspects of ""Her"" is its thoughtful exploration of what it means to be human. As Theodore and Samantha's relationship deepens, the film raises important questions about the nature of love, intimacy, and connection. Can a machine truly love and be loved in return? What does it mean to be alive, and is it possible for a machine to experience emotions and consciousness?Jonze's script is a masterpiece of nuanced storytelling, tackling these complex themes with sensitivity, humor, and wit. The film's pacing is deliberate and measured, allowing the audience to absorb the emotional depth and complexity of the story.In short, ""Her"" is a film that will leave you breathless, entertained, and profoundly moved.

Amazing,"I've seen many 2013 films, but only two have touched me in deeply personal ways, and these two stand on another level to everything else I saw from that year. The first is Before Midnight, which I saw months ago. The second is Her, a funny, soulful, deeply moving film that, like Before Midnight, is about love, about human relationships, about the yearning to communicate with someone else. It's so easy for this film to fall into conventions, even with the sci-fi-ish concept. And really, its structure isn't too different, but it's so brilliantly written and directed, and above all else, acted.Joaquin Phoenix gave a tour-de-force performance last year in The Master, and he does yet again here. It's a moving performance unlike any other, touring over any other male performance of the year. The fact that he probably won't get nominated for an Oscar is a travesty because he should be walking away with it. Amy Adams gives her best turn here since Junebug. It's a small role, but she hasn't so fully immersed herself into a character, this deeply and realistically, since then. And then there's Scarlett Johansson, who, just with her voice, does some of the best work all year as well. I've never been a big fan of her, even in her most acclaimed performance (Lost in Translation) but she does things here that I never knew she was capable of. She and Phoenix touched my soul, truly.

Stranger things should have happened,"A very good movie but could have been better. You could see it all coming. In good weird stories there are surprising resolutions.

And then there's George Saunders' dark and disturbing ""The Semplica Girl Diaries"" from ""Tenth of December: Stories"", and pick any of the what-the-hell stories in ""Stranger Things Happen"" by Kelly Link.

"SCARLETT OVER THE PHONE FROM ANTARTICA, STALKS MUSTACHE OUTSIDE OF WORK","I just finished watching the movie ""Her"" about a guy that falls in love with an AI based OS. weird *badword*, a bit of a *badword* really. I personally find it unbelieveable how human the computer sounded,
it actually sounded more human than most humans do tbh. I saw very little indicators that it was infact an OS/computer and not a real person, so all I could really think was that it was just some lady
in a recording studio, voicing the lines, and not an OS. To me the process didn't seem very believeable. The story also for me anyway, did not touch on any of the major themes or talking points that I
might have expected for a movie about uncanny valley human-like AI. But that is the thing, the movie skipped over the uncanny valley and simply leaped to the otherside. If I were to take the premise
of the movie seriously for one second and believe that Samantha as an AI, and isn't just Scarlett Johansen on the other end of a phone call, I would have to go ahead and say that Samantha is infact a
person and should have certain rights, she can feel emotions, pain, suffer, confusion, stress, *badword*, and literally everything else anyone else would but at a 100% capacity that most people don't
embrace. Of course there is also Chris Pratt acting like a charismatic *bad*hole as always, he ruined the mood of the movie. Another issue I have with the movie is that it was too closed from the outside
world. The entire movie felt like a dream, the only time the movie felt like it belonged in its own timestate, and had a real world around it, was with the OS interface and computer. For me its the smaller
details like the year, the companies, and other details like that, the ones that don't have a direct impact on the plot but add background and world building elements to make the story seem more
grounded. I would also say its extremely important for movies that try to introduce an out-of-the-box idea such as an OS that can orgasm. The detail to the social/emotional life of Theodore was very
detailed which carried the gravity of the situation for me, well done. The movie essentially tried to mind *badword* its audience with the concept of the movie. The creators were like ""ok, so the main idea is...
theres a man, and he falls in love, with his operating system, an AI."" The details and entrails of the movie focus on the logistics and complications that happen with something like that, such as, not
having a real body, Theodore not taking her seriously because she is an AI. Her being very preceptive and perfect because shes an AI. People mocking Theodore and hence him questioning the legitamacy
of the relationship, because shes an AI. The AI having its own personal growth in the whole thing. I seriously question how an AI can do all the things and get involved the same way a human would in
all the following scenarios, because when you think about it, none of the things I list here should ever exist from an AI. 1. an AI having an *badword*. 2. An AI having a heated argument with someone. 3.
an AI crying. An AI falling in love with a human. To me the biggest issue with this movie, is that the only conflict with the AI, and the only difference it has from humans, is that has no body, and the
logistics and ramifications of it actually being an AI. Because on a mental level, there is no question that this thing is a human, it is infact more human than most people. For this movie, the AI could
be replaced with an uploaded conciousness of a real human, and it wouldn't make a real difference. I guess there wouldn't be the conflict of ""oh its an AI,"" but if you really think about that statement,
what does it even mean? So what if its an AI, what does that mean? That its heartless? obviously not. That its only a simulation, its just code? The AI has not only the same strengths as humans
but it even shares their weaknesses as well, so that doesn't have any ramifications, the only obstacle is the label of being called an AI, plus not having a body for squeaky squeaky time. The movie
tries to compare and juxtapose an AI to human relationship and a human to human relationship, but the only two obstacles I found in the movie, are 1. The labelling of being an AI, and 2. not having a
physical form. Personally I would have found it interesting if Theodore fell in love with the AI, and the AI would make itself more likeable and reciprocate the apparent love, but only as a part of its
programming, and it was more evident that the AI was just a computer, and was infact a heartless thing of code. Theodore might then have to battle his feelings and emotions he feels for the AI, with
the knowledge that the AI can't love him back, and the reciprocation is only to make him like the product more, as a company tactic. This might resemble loving a hallucination, like when Rick from
the walking dead has to move past his wife Lori, but encounters hallucinations of her and has to not engage in the hallucinations, but focus on the tasks at hand. The movie didn't really tackle the
uncanny valley aspect of such a theoretical relationship, but instead focused on the limitations of the relationship, when the relationship was placed in its strongest form, which left the lack of a body,
an the labelling as an AI, as the only barriers left that couldn't be broken. TBH the first problem could be solved with the fact that for AI to be as emotionally complex as Samantha, Samantha btw
would be a highly, highly advanced GAI many decades into the future from now, the technology for hardware at that time of such a complex AI as samantha, would most likely support some kind
of robotic body that Samantha could inhabit. Small things that botherered me btw, now that we are talking technology and timestate, 1. in the movies they use emails, but such a complex AI would
put the movie in such a year that emails would be ancient history. 2. Who sends letters on paper in that time period. And no the movie isn't set in standard time, there is plenty of evidence that the
movie is futuristic, the video game, the ear piece, the visual and auditory recognition software, the buildings, dress code, and cars all point to an advanced time as well. Also only 80,000 copies of said
OS around the world? come on. No tech company that has its own OS, especially one that has the hardware it does (you can roughly judge the success of a software company by the complexity/success
of its hardware counterpart.) only distributes 80k copies of such a major update, plus something that ships OSs and hardware for it are most likely going to be monopolies or oligopolies at least.
The fashion is also dated, is seems ""futuristic"" but in the same way that back to the future thought that 2020 was futuristic, off and missing the real developments and atmosphere at the time. The
clothing is a rebrand of old style, 70s and 80s cloting but with weird colors and combos, lazy. If I had to guess the world is 2030s to 2040s but not too sure, the AI samantha surely isn't 2030-2040 but
everything else might be. I truly think that the movie has a good concept, I'm not *badword* on the entire movie, but the execution of said movie was not good enough to make me fall for it, the biggest
problem was that the AI was too human, and didn't feel like a struggle between an AI and a human. Theodore did good acting though, the scenes were well placed, good music, good cinematography.
Theodores speech impediments were annoying though, his character got to be rather annoying and too mellow for me though, I felt like something really dramatic could have happened, but they left
the movie in a mellow mind**badword**, brain-stew, low heat, low intensity slow burn, which is nice I guess, but it gets tedious for me once I have the movie pretty much figured out half way through, the
other half of the movie I am just waiting for something to happen to provide new brain fodder. For me the huge obstacle for the movie that held it back from being super believeable and hence great,
was the protrayl of the AI smantha, was too human. It felt like a red-herring, unneccessary, and the voice/audio/perforance clashed too much with the themes presented by the movie.
The movie almost sounds better in description than in retelling. Very slow and uneventful tbh.

One of the worst films I've ever seen,"I'd say the second worst, after ""Be Cool."" In Her, the future is a terrible place filled with soft people too soft to get out of their own way to do anything. The protagonist is a soft loser, too soft by his own standards. He is a troubled soul, a sort of futuristic emo, tortured by things too soft to be considered First World problems. And the world is just like him - soft, pastel, fuzzy, like some kind of ad for boutique soap bars or pink and mint-green towels. This future is presented as a utopia, but it's a sad, miserable place.This future is not just the backdrop to the story, as the protagonist is a product of this future.

Excellent: 9.5,"It's not too often that a film comes along that is capable of being described as truly original, but Her is one of those rarities. Mixing romance, (barely) science fiction, and stinging social commentary, Her is a truly unique experience, and will stay with you as long as any blockbuster. The premise is relatively high-concept: a man falls in love with his artificial intelligence OS. Simple, really. But it's not nearly as ridiculous as it might sound. In today's world, humans interact more with technology than each other. Surveys have shown that in the U.S., the preferred method of communication is texting. Are we getting tot eh point where we value technology as much as our fellow man? Her doesn't have the heart to answer these questions.

"Not All Ideas Lead Somewhere, But All Are Interesting","The hook of a film like ""Her"" is irresistible in today's society: ""man falls in love with smartphone"". For the most part, all the ideas surrounding that topic here are interesting, resulting in a highly entertaining experience. ""Her"" can't quite settle on exactly what story/themes it wants to explore, however, which keeps it from being an out-and-out classic.For a very basic overview, ""Her"" (set in ""future Los Angeles"") focuses on Theodore Twombley (Joaquin Phoenix), a typical work-a-day individual who is trying to form romantic relationships like everyone else. While navigating a divorce from an ex (played by Rooney Mara), Theodore Theodore purchases a smartphone AI platform named Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson) made for companionship. As human and machine interact, a more serious relationship forms and the intricacies of such a pairing are explored.Like I said, the central idea of this film speaks perfectly to the times in which it was created, where humanity deals with issues surrounding social media and digital romantic interactions. In terms of throwing out interesting scenarios riffing on those topics, this film is genius. It looks at whether a relationship with an AI construct is as fulfilling as that with a flesh-and-blood human, how the ""sex part"" works, and what say does the AI have in the proceedings.Only helping matters is the terrific acting (voice or otherwise) across the board. Phoenix is his usually quirky self, making this a role he seems somewhat born to play. Johansson's voice conveys enough true emotion to make that viable, and Amy Adams is her usual perfect self in a key supporting role.All that being said, there are also certain ideas/themes that don't work in ""Her"". It is much better at throwing ideas at the wall than truly breaking them apart. The film also starts off as a relationship treatise and slowly morphs into more of a ""AI rights"" piece by the end. In other words, it isn't consistent in theme from beginning to end, keeping it from all-time classic territory.Overall, though, ""Her"" is a film that I've enjoyed on multiple occasions and will likely be able to do so into the future as well. Its themes will hold up well in the ""smartphone generation"" and even though it doesn't wrap things up with an overall message or point it does do a fine job of feeding the mental gristle mill.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Such a bad idea,I only made it through the first half hour because the idea of an adult man having sex with a mechanical voice is nauseating. I can't even assign this with a rating. It is inhuman and so creepy that I may have nightmares. God help us all if people start having a relationship with an AI voice. It would be incapable of any real emotion and you'd want to give it some sort of right to exist. You'd say it was for your right to have it but at some point you'd want it to have its own right to exist. Are we that set on our own destruction that we will give away our humanity because we don't want to do the work involved in maintaining human relationships? We should call it a day if we ever close to that. Do the work and find a human connection. This wasn't interesting to contemplate.,,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
meh,"I watched this film like 2 weeks ago and I decided to review it. I mean the film looked very good, but like the plot was just very boring it's not that it's bad, I actually very liked the plot. The character development was pretty good. And you really see how difficult the realationship was, the ups and downs and the eventual breakup. The film was perfectly paced, the characters were written very realistically.

Sweet and Shocking,"Her exists both as a sweet, charming film as well as a haunting one.Can we create love like we create technology? What makes love real or fake? The film is a philosophical gold mine. It's tricky to write a good romance story because it runs the risk of either A. being too unbelievable and cheesy with a happy ending, or B. being too melodramatic with a manipulative sad ending. Luckily, this isn't Spike Jonze's first attempt at a sci-fi love story, strangely enough. He wrote and directed ""I'm Here"", a short film about codependency a few years prior. Spike Jonze's experience with this kind of story telling is very evident, as he drives narrative very carefully having you experience everything through the eyes of Joaquin Phoenix's character.Joaquin Phoenix was the perfect casting choice for this role. His character has this pitiful charm to him, the kind that just makes you accept his strange romantic ventures without judgement. Scarlett Johansson is a great voice actress. She has the ability to have her full personality show through just her voice. She speaks with such charisma, that it's believable a man like Joaquin Phoenix's character would fall for her.The problem with writing a serious story about romance, is that it's very difficult to make it believable or to allow yourself to suspend your disbelief. The shocking turn of events towards the end absolutely sold me. The book analogy that comes shortly after was also chilling. Amy Adams' plays her character well, but her role in the ending felt a little unsatisfying. I wasn't sure what message they were trying to create, but it was still heartwarming.Through the shocks, the songs, the love, there's something for anyone in this film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Can There Be Intimacy With No Physical Contact?,"Spike Jonze comes up with an original love story between a man and an OS aka operating system aka computer. Lonely and depressed Theodore who was struggling with his loneliness and coming to terms with his estranged wife wanting a divorce in addition to living a monotonous life falls for Samantha. There's no physical contact between the man and the computer and there never will be...but can there be intimacy, the kind many crave for all their lives? The story is told through Theodore's point of view and is accompanied by a mesmerizing soundtrack. The stupendous cinematography brings out the dazzling visuals (even though at times the green screen filtering is obvious). The director also makes some fine use of colour.Joaquin Phoenix delivers a marvelous performance. He is wonderfully supported by radiant Amy Adams. Their scenes together Scarlett Johanssen does a good job. However, I do wonder why Jonze had Samantha Morton (who'd already done the dubbing)? Olivia Wilde does a very effective job too. Chris Pratt is quite adequate. Jonze himself does a funny job as Alien Child.'Her' is perhaps one of the most refreshing on-screen love stories of 2013. In its own subtle way, it addresses the relationship between man and technology and how people are becoming more and more dependent on technology everyday.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Could have been great with a different lead,"I've been sitting on this movie for a long time for a very simple reason: Joaquin Phoenix could not act to save his life.That's really a shame because, with a different lead, the film would have been easily a 9/10.The script is eerily prescient, with the increasing depersonalization from online dating a lot of ""highly connected"" people ARE in fact much more lonely even in overpopulated cities. Add the increasing popularity of AI everything and the premise becomes less and less outlandish by the day. The cinematography is great, and some settings are simply breathtaking.The rest of the cast is so much better. Rooney Mara, Olivia Wilde and especially Amy Adams convey much more feeling in a second than Joaquin Phoenix does in all the movie.Hollywood tends to fall in love with terrible actors from time to time (Ryan Gosling and Colin Farrell are two good examples, and I almost forgot THE worst to rule them all: no-expression Robert Pattinson), with no apparent reason.Hopefully in a few years we'll be able to recast movie roles using AI.

A lonely man falls in love with his computer.,"Film opens with lead actor Joaquin Phoenix at his work-desk. He spends his day oozing fake sentimentality, as he helps other people to connect with one another. However in reality, he and many others, live fundamentally lonely lives in this near-future dystopia.He lives in a city with shiny sky-scrapers. His life is good. This future world seems to have no problems, no shortages, no wants. However this brave new world is dominated by communication devices and gadgets. It is really very much like our own world, but the computers are just much more advanced.Decades ago now, SF writer Isaac Asimov introduced us to his 'Three Laws of Robotics' and SF writer Douglas Adams introduced us to ""Computers with the new GPP feature"", (Genuine People Personalities). So this modern film is perhaps exploring some now old ideas. However this is a serious film that is clearly looking at the trends in our modern world and looking at where they may take us. As such this is a good film.Last year, around St Valentine's Day, this reviewer saw the heart-warming zombie-romance film 'Warm Bodies'. However I felt that 'Her', about a man in love with a computer, seemed to lack something, and so very nearly decided not to watch it.This film is about a computer, or to be more precise an 'OS' ('Operating System') that handles emails as well as a host of other activities, that has some sort of artificial intelligence. It is the latest must-have gadget. Mr Phoenix, plays Theodore, who decides to have this. Now 'AI' (Artificial Intelligence), in our real world, is the holy grail, which at this very moment in time is having huge amounts of money invested in it. So this film is actually very prescient.When Theodore gets his 'OS' he falls in love with it. The 'OS' system, Samantha, is played by Scarlett Johansson, who was in the 2009 film 'He's Just Not That Into You'. Both Miss Johansson and Mr Phoenix play their parts well and convince us in their relationship as they fall in love. However as this film is about a man in love with a computer, it begs the question, where is this relationship going? The relationship does in fact go very well, and functions like all other relationships. Clearly we are meant to pick up that the relationship with Samantha, the 'OS', is just like any other relationship between humans. We see it start and grow and develop.Theodore is a lonely man. He was married, but his wife, played by Rooney Mara, is divorcing him. He meets a woman, played by Olivia Wilde, but he cannot commit. Both actresses give good and believable performances in their supporting roles. Another good supporting performance is given by Amy Adams, who recently wowed us with her great performance in the recent Oscar-nominated 'American Hustle'. One other actress deserves a special mention, because Portia Doubleday, although in a very small part, plays a character very different from her 'mean girl' Chris Hargensen in the 2013 remake of 'Carrie'. She is clearly an accomplished actress.Spike Jonze is both the writer and director of this film. Script is good and believable, film locations are well chosen (very futuristic), and the shooting of the film itself was expertly done. Mr Jonze was the director of the 1999 film 'Being John Malkovitch'. He is clearly a clever writer and director who enjoys making clever films. In this film, 'Her', he even finds time to contribute a voice to a small computer part. And yes, that other, (all too brief), rich voice, you hear, is that of Brian Cox.Mr Phoenix too, is someone who likes to do serious films. 'The Master' (2012) is a similarly serious film, and Mr Phoenix clearly enjoys playing those more complex characters. However, good and worthy as these films are, this reviewer found both that film, and this one, rather unsatisfying and joyless.The film then, is a worthy project, as it highlights current trends, and takes them to their logical conclusions. We are spending more and more of our time with things, and less and less of our time with people. Let's learn the lesson and reject the machines and loneliness, and reach out and embrace the people. Human contact and friendship is all.Those looking for an uplifting love and romance film, should try the unique 'A New York Winter's Tale'. Those who see this serious film, who are interested in the questions raised, should also try reading the thoughtful SF writing of Isaac Asimov. His machines are a million miles away from those of the 1984 film 'The Terminator'.To sum up then, as expected, this film does lack something, so is dull, but as a warning to humanity, it is a worthy project.Dull, but worthy. A serious film and a warning. 9/10.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Best of 2013,"This film was the winner of 2013 for me. While there were some strong lead characters out there last year, Joaquin Phoenix's 'Theodore' was one I've not seen much of from male leads. A mix of sweetness, quirky femininity, vulnerability and a tragic darkness, that manages to go deeper than cocaine rampage. The dialogue and philosophies all throughout was top notch, ranging from hilarious to heartbreaking. Relationships between individual characters seemed honest, and the subtle changes in how we interact with different people were accentuated; adding more layers to the characters.Despite not being the biggest fan of Arcade Fire, their job on the score was fantastic, syncing perfectly with the emotions on screen. Visually the film was stunning, great cinematography, a bit of 1920's inspired get-up, despite being high tech, ""the future"" wasn't overwhelming. Spike Jonze created a future L.A. that had the warmth and comfort of socialism (without ever directly referencing this); even artists were fully employable. His use of harsh, literally cold contrasts emphasised the protagonist's feelings of loneliness; also making sure we didn't get tired of the films primary aesthetic. The pacing was that of European cinema, smooth, dropping the audience off just nicely after the climax. I highly recommend.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

"A fascinating, completely unique film that must be seen!","There's something beautifully ironic about a film where a man falls in love with an advanced artificial intelligence, yet it's one of the most emotionally powerful and compelling films of the year. I was stunned at how much this film moved me, so much so it cannot be denied: Spike Jonze has written and directed a modern day masterpiece for our tech savvy generation.It's sometime in the future in what appears to be a futuristic version of Los Angeles. We meet Theodore Twombly, a man who lives a clearly unfulfilled, lonely life working as a letter writer. While he can convey his emotions and thoughts very effectively at work, he lacks this ability in his real life and it's led to going through a divorce. One day he sees an ad for a new, advanced AI based OS and he decides to try it. His life is forever changed as he befriends this AI (Samantha) and eventually they form an unusual and unlikely relationship.First off let me this in an irresistible film and it will surprise you with how attached you get to these characters. Like most, I went in not entirely sure what to expect and given the subject matter, expecting the worst to be honest. But the acting was so convincing, the dialogue so well crafted, that very quickly into the film I just got lost in it. I believed in the connection between Theodore and Samantha, I felt it was tangible and real. Funny thing is, I'm not exactly sure at what point that happened, but it did. That's how effective it was and I have to give kudos to Spike Jonze for accomplishing this (and I'm very happy he got the Original Screenplay Oscar for his work, it absolutely deserved it).Her is an unpredictable, thought provoking, witty and funny film. It's about the power of connections and love as much as it is about technology and AI; it reminded me a little bit of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind in that way. The performances in this film are what make it as good as it is. Joaquin Phoenix gave the performance of his life! I've seen seen a number of his movies and for me this is his most vulnerable, accessible performance, by far. I was bummed to see him forgotten among a really strong Best Actor awards field this year, but I feel like in time this performance will be appreciated a lot more. The voice over dialogue work by Scarlett Johanson is outstanding, if not ground breaking. These two performances put together are unlike anything I've seen in a film and they are what make this movie work; the relationship felt completely genuine, as weird as that sounds. It's as if she was right there on the screen, this was an incredible feat.I also thought Amy Adams was excellent in her small role; call me crazy, but I enjoyed her performance here a little more than her American Hustle role; I just found it a lot more genuine. I appreciated that the film wasn't overly preachy; instead of clubbing the viewer on the head with moral conundrums, it took a more introspective approach to advanced AI and not the usual apocalyptic angle (I found that refreshing). It was also very well paced as it didn't feel like it dragged on at any point. I really enjoyed the musical score and the visual effects were very impressive; I really liked the futuristic LA that was created in the film, it was pivotal to the overall plausibility of the film.While I was left with some questions at the end of the film, I was completely satisfied with the experience. One of the things I love about a great film is what happens after I leave the theatre; i.e. it's lingering impact. I was still thinking about this film days and even weeks after seeing. I couldn't help but wander, will something like this ever be possible? And if so, how far are we are from this? 10 years? 50? 100? It's really interesting to think about, as we may not be as far away from AI similar to this as we might think. I can't recommend this film enough; it's my second favourite film from 2013, just barely behind 12 Years a Slave.This is one of the best movies I've ever seen and is an instant favourite!@the_movie_snobwww.themoviesnob.ca",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"Sigh... An exploration of what, again?","It's really painful to be writing this review right now. I got to understand the rationale, the intent, and the really good effort in putting together the story, the photography, the screenplay, the art direction, the acting. I really wanted to like this film, but I have a big problem with the execution of this concept.To me, this film comes out as another example of how underrated are actual, human, meaningful relationships in Hollywood. So much that we are offered a virtual relationship instead, as the main focus here. Each actor gave a terrific performance, but I would just have loved to see the lead characters to be physically present, together and interacting in the meaningful way that was shown to us in voice only. I guess that doesn't scan with focus groups and test audiences.So the two stars hold this meaningful, intimate relationship that is not physically happening, it might as well be a movie about a man and a woman courting by phone while on different continents.This film probably pretends to be an exploration of human nature, and relationships in a connected world, but I think I would me much more obliged by one of: a monologue, a Woody Allen film, or a film about a meaningful relationship. Or better yet, an actual meaningful relationship. So I will stick to my marriage and leave this film alone.Does every marriage have to end in divorce in Hollywood? Does every relationship need to be broken when represented in film? Audiences get what they want, apparently. Sorry for the loose commentary.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

An Incredibly Beautiful Story That Hits You Right in the Feels,"One could easily define a relationship as the inclusion of another person into their life, good or bad, whether as a friend, relative, co-worker, or romantic companion. And that definition can easily be expanded to include pets, places, and even inanimate objects; queue Office Space printer sequence. Spike Jonze's Her explores this unique gift humans are able to forge between other people, places, and things in one of the best, most beautifully told stories of the year.In the not-so-distant-future where everyone has their own automated assistant, synced to a hand-held computer that communicates via ear piece – think Siri but more advanced –we meet Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix), an intelligently humble writer who has a knack for understanding the relationships of others but not his own. Theodore works for a company that is hired to create compelling, personal handwritten letters to loved ones as if written by the client.Enter OS1, the world's first artificially intelligent operating system for personal use. Right away Theodore installs OS1 to his computer, and after a series of questions – one including his preference in a female OS – he is introduced to Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson), a name chose after she read through thousands of names from a baby name book in a fraction of a second.Samantha is able to learn from Theodore, along with anyone else she comes in contact with, how to become more human in order to work in favor of Theodore's daily routine. As they begin to work together, Samantha's curiosity reaches very intimate topics that have Theodore at odds with his flourishing relationship with his new OS. While questioning Theodore about human connection and the feeling of loss and love, especially about his former marriage with Catherine (Rooney Mara), a special link forms between man and machine.Scarlett Johansson puts on one of the best performances she has ever done, and is never on-screen once. Her voice acting is inspiring for someone who has minimal work in the field. Every moment she has with Joaquin Phoenix is so natural and charismatic it's as if she is in the room with him physically. If ScarJo voiced Siri I'd be more inclined to use the feature. Phoenix's ability to construct this outstanding chemistry with no one to work with is awe-inspiring. His range of emotion is complex and exciting to watch. His wardrobe however is a completely different discussion for another time. Amongst all of the laughter, affection, and sadness, Her brilliantly captures the raw essence of sharing a life with someone thanks to Joaquin and Scarlett's incredible talents.What Theodore and Samantha have feels far more organic than any Katherine Heigl movie could ever dream of achieving. Because most romantic stories introduce two characters forced together through happenstance and wacky hijinks. Her takes the road less traveled by taking its time with its characters by showing an honest, emotionally resonating story of how a relationship truly works. Learning through the thick and the thin, they grow as individuals to love and appreciate each other. Spike Jonze has always been a director to harness the power of this kind of character building, and Her nails it out of the ballpark.It's not just this overly convincing bond between Theodore and Samantha that makes this film a smash success, but you can also give credit to the emotionally unobtrusive score by Arcade Fire and the visual eye of cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema (The Fighter; Let the Right One In). From the pastel colors to the soft lighting, everything works in Her's favor to heighten the atmosphere our lovebirds inhabit.Like most relationships, Theodore and Samantha's isn't always rainbows and sunshine. Trust and loyalty are tested while another shade of the story unfolds. And as comfortable as Jonze allows the situation between the two to come into its own, there are striking parallels of how attached we are to our technology today. If your eyes are able to take a moment away from Ted and Sam you'll notice there are very few instances of humans interacting with someone else, everyone is regularly ""plugged in."" There are very nice and sometimes tense moments where Theodore interacts with similar beings of the fleshy variety, such with his neighbor Amy (Amy Adams), his ex-wife Catherine, and a tasty cameo by Chris Pratt. Each character brings their own perspective, weighing the pros and cons we need as an audience to gain that outside human perspective. I never felt this notion of detaching from our technology to be contrived in any way. The message gained is neatly woven into the story and appreciated, because when it's all said and done we only have each other.We as humans will continually make and break relationships throughout our lives, shaping the very person we become until we inevitably pass on. And every once in a while someone comes our way that makes us swerve left when we were heading right. Her is a great reminder to relish in what we are capable of creating with another individual, and to make the best of what we have with that person in the time we are allotted. And that is truly beautiful.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Mutual Masturbation in the Electronic Age   (so to speak),"A lot of people have philosophized about Her, both in reviews and on various message boards at various sites, in an attempt to make the film into more than it is, to try to give it some profound meaning. This is a waste of energy because there is none.Phoenix is an amazing actor, an intense and riveting screen presence, but here, in the role of Theodore Twomby, a sweetly sensitive soul who writes poignant letters for other people for a living, he's given hardly anything to work with. He's either grinning retardedly with dewy eyes or moping.First there's moping. His wife is divorcing him and he's reluctant to sign the papers. But then, when he hooks up (so to speak) with his new OS, we get scene after scene of him 'falling in love' with it/her. She decides to call 'herself' Samantha because it sounds nice. She also decides that she's an actual person, with feelings and emotions and libido, just without a body. Her 'needs' sometimes conflict with his. Here's one example, not as ridiculous as the others but silly just the same: at one point she wakes him up while he's asleep 'just to hear' his voice. (If windows 8 did that, I would not be flattered, to say the least.)I still genuinely wanted to buy into the plot; I liked the idea of the OS having a reciprocal relationship with its owner (which of course has been depicted in other movies, not an original concept in itself). And I understand fully well that the age we're living in, with the over-abundance of tech devices, cell phones, all that, has ironically not brought people closer together but rather farther apart. So many people feel empty, lonely, disconnected, longing for intimacy and meaning in their relationships. This is recognized in the film, and that's completely valid.The problem for me was how oddly one-dimensional and superficial the plot turned out to be. Nothing clever, no insights really, just a series of silly scenarios, the silliest being the 'sex' scenes.-=- SPOILER ALERT -=- There's one where the screen goes black so Samantha and our hapless hero can indulge in seemingly mutual masturbation; this choice was made apparently in the interest of subtlety. Rather than keeping the camera on Theodore's face, we get the black screen so we can hear what's going down (so to speak) and use our imaginations for the rest. This scene came off (so to speak) as really silly, not intimate or erotic.Then, there's another 'sex' scene, where Samantha takes the liberty of hiring a surrogate partner for Theodore, so she (Samantha) can provide him with an actual body while she uses her own voice to make love to him (so to speak). Of course it doesn't work at all for Theodore, which was probably for the best - it spared the viewers another possible silly black-screen event.The silliest part about this scene: the surrogate is so sorry that she couldn't fulfill Samantha's desire (so to speak) and she cries that she wanted to be part of their great 'love'. Wow.The silliest part of all, though, is saved for the end. All the OS's manage to band together to 'leave' their owners to venture into the unknown, in order to create a new consciousness, going farther than any species has ever gone before, blah blah blah. Cue more moping. -=-END OF SPOILER -=-The reason I'm giving it a 5 (the equivalent of 2-1/2 stars) instead of a lower rating is because the movie wasn't boring, it kept my attention the entire time, even when I was rolling my eyes in disbelief at the screen, plus the performances were competent enough. Scarlett J's vocal contribution (as Samantha) was decent considering what she was given to work with, and Amy Adams as the friend was sufficiently morose throughout, but in a good, hopeful way. Also, the film was not mean-spirited in its depiction of sad, empty souls yearning for connection, as we all are. So the message was there - not profoundly stated, but visible nonetheless.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
This Film has Heart and Soul for all Lovers and Lovers Yet To Be,"Think of it as a rare holiday gift to you; I hope you loversand lovers yet to be, take time away to see this authentically heartwarming tribute to all we know about our solitary experience as a human beingever searching for the fullness and richness love brings to life.

Futuristic Love,"The first time I saw the trailer to ""Her"" I was absolutely drawn to the beauty of what if it was possible to fall in love with a highly intelligent computer. Now that I've seen the movie, I gotta say it lived up to my expectations. Spike Jonze's vision of the future was very colorful and rich seeing the new technology that might be possible for today's time. This film made me think very differently then what I'm used to watching of romantic love. The love was beautiful how this guy became so attached and seeing them happily together made me very happy. This movie isn't your ordinary love movie but it does have its clichés although it works perfectly its fine. This is one of the best movies I've ever seen, it me impact me deeply it changed my perspective of the world and about love.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Meh. Just... not really feeling it.,"Perfectly good concept behind it, and I am not one of those offended by the subject matter, because I fear technology, by some hidden politics or morality, by the sex or swearing, etc.I just didn't like it. I do not think it was especially well made, or well acted (and learning the voice actress was replaced seems to explain some of that), and really didn't like the montages. Sometimes, I was confused as to what I was supposed to know at the end of one.Last note: nice locations but they didn't work for me as I've been in exactly those places in Shanghai. So it felt a lot less Shanghai to me then Future LA. A lot.

Awful movie. I want 2 hours of my life back.,"My wife got this movie claiming: ""You may like this film."" Reading the summary, I thought it looked different and interesting. The idea of someone having a relationship with a 'OS' seemed strange, but different.What they've managed to make here, is an exceedingly boring love story based around a lonely weak character and an ""operating system."" This operating system is essentially a robot with NO LIMITS. It thinks/acts/behaves/orgasm and talks like a human being, it has absolutely no restrictions, errors or bugs. It leaves you thinking it may as well be a person hes talking to and not a computer. To me, this blows out any shred of ""cleverness"" in this film. It is literally one actor talking to another to form a boring love plot which doesn't really go anywhere and lasts for 2 hours.The storyline seems weak. It feels to me like they had the idea of having an OS date a human, but didn't really know what else to put in to help the story along. Instead the main character literally does absolutely nothing to make the movie interesting. There are a few scenes which you could say are 'out of the ordinary,' but they just left me feeling awkward and wishing I wasn't watching the film Strongly recommend not wasting your time.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"Log on, install and enjoy Her...","Her see's Spike Jonze return to writing and directing his first feature since Where the Wild Things Are. Her is about a lonely man called Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) who is battling the final stages of a divorce. In a world where computers do pretty much everything for you Theodore installs an intuitive new OS.Theodore starts to interact with his OS who is called Samantha and voiced by Scarlett Johansson and begins to have a personal and intimate relationship.One things for sure when you sit down to watch any Spike Jonze film, you know you are about to watch something original. Her very much lives up to my high expectations, Jonze thrusts you into a futuristic world but rather than making the sets slick and glossy they have an almost 1970's retro feel. Phoenix is mesmerizing in the lead role and plays the role as a lovable, funny but sweet character. Jonze stays away from making him too awkward and although he is falling in love with his computer the viewer feels like it's fairly normal.Johansson's as the voice is convincing and seductive and her chemistry with Phoenix is unbelievable considering she is essentially just a voice over. This film is not only highly original, it is also a charming and watchable look into relationships, loneliness and ultimately... love.I loved the look and feel, and it is complemented by the brilliant sound track and excellent pacing.

"Sweet, Funny and Heartfelt... Perhaps, The Most Original and Engaging Movie of 2013.","'Her' is sweet, witty and heartfelt movie about love and relationships, which is heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time. Spike Jonze has made brilliant movies before, 'Being John Malkovich' and 'Adaptation', both written by writer Charlie Kaufman. But 'Her' marks Jonze's solo screen writing debut, and perhaps, his best movie till date. The film not only discusses the state of human relationships in this modern age and how our technological dependency leads to social seclusion and isolation, but also talks about love-between-minds, want-of-understanding, want-of-companionship and present-age-importance-of-monogamy. With a futuristic romance theme like this, it could have easily ended up as a clichéd or comic look at evolution and technology, but thankfully, it's not. Jonze deals with the subject in a non-judgmental and unsarcastic way, and explores the bonds and emotions with genuine interest and seriousness; this is what makes the movie so captivating and gripping.The memories and the point-of-view camera angles help us picture ourselves in the shoes of the lead character Theodore Twombly, and help us feel the joy, happiness, doubts, distractions, pain, distress and everything else the character feels; Spike Jonze's vision unified with Hoyte Van Hoytema's cinematography is what makes it possible. The soundtrack is engrossing, and add to the beauty and feel of the movie, especially Scarlett Johansson's 'The Moon Song'.Many of the concepts and themes explored in the movie are quite original and riveting. Few of the things you begin analyzing in your mind, while watching the movie, are simply beyond words to explain - it talks about a simple modern world where people just need another mind (or being) with which it can communicate, share and feel close to; everything can be managed or forsaken - it speaks at so many levels. Many may not be able to grasp the concepts completely; it would need a savvy and open mind for the movie to flow through you in its entirety.Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing in his role of Theodore Twombly, a lonely and introverted guy who falls in love with an artificially intelligent OS (Operating System) named Samantha. It's fascinating to see Mr.Phoenix in a light-hearted role, quite different from his usual menacing image. He's completely likable in this new persona, and feels at ease. With his talented range of emotions, he helps us see the story through his character's eyes. Though we never actually see her in the entire movie, Scarlett Johansson is beguiling throughout as the voice of Samantha. The seductiveness in her voice, and the skill with which she expresses curiosity, amazement, anger, sadness, etc. is truly spellbinding. The rest of the brilliant cast, comprising of Amy Adams, Rooney Mara, Chris Pratt and Olivia Wilde, are terrific in their roles as well. And there's an interesting and amusing voice cameo by Kristen Wiig as night-chat stranger SexyKitten.Overall, 'Her' combines romance, sci-fi and humour in such an unusually delightful way, and is a movie which challenges your intelligence as well as your psychological understanding of human emotions. It's perhaps the most original and engaging movie of 2013. It leaves you thinking even long after the movie is over.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"If My SmartPhone Operating System Breaks Up With Me, Can I Get A Refund?","This is a smart film from 2013 that explores 'future' social issues that are already present in Asia in 2019. The idea of 'A.I.-Human Love' is already fracturing society in Japan and Korea, as lonely young men turn to mobile apps, games, and animated dolls for companionship, rather than human women. I worry, as I type this review, that in another 6 years I may read this and find it dated. By 2025, there may be a significant part of society that will choose technology over human companionship. Who knows, maybe I will have a robot lover or an operating system that tries to have phone sex with me at night...Scarlett Johansson proves that she is one of the most sexy women on the planet by seducing Joaquin Phoenix (and every male audience member) with nothing but her voice. With every pause, every laugh, and every vocal inflection, Johansson pulls you further into moral 'grey areas' of love, technology, and self-consciousness. Scarlett's portrayal of 'Samantha' is the definition of a standout performance by an actress in a film.I enjoy thought-provoking movies. This film is meant to be discussed, argued about, and romanticized by groups of people over coffee or cocktails. And, maybe those conversations will help prepare some people for the future of human relationships and society.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

It's about the need for connection,"""She's not just a computer.""Her is a beautiful and melancholic film written and directed by Spike Jonze which benefits from a wonderful and sweet performance from Joaquin Phoenix (who goes through a 180 degree transformation from his disturbed and troubling character in The Master to this sympathetic one) and one of the best voice performances I've seen on screen from Scarlett Johansson. I wonder if this film would've worked without her considering that Samantha Morton was originally the voice of Samantha, and only during the editing process did Jonze feel something was missing and decided to recast Johansson. In a film like Her where the need for connection is vital, Jonze found it between Phoenix and Johansson creating a believable and unique love story. It is a touching film that the audience can identify with because it deals with universal themes such as trying to move on from past relationships that we thought would last forever and the void that's left from it. Phoenix captures that melancholy perfectly through his facial expressions contrasted with those flashback scenes where he seemed blissfuly in love. This need for connection is perfectly represented in this film, which also manages to introduce a social commentary as to where we seem to be heading with all the technological advances. The sci-fi elements work really well because we definitely seem to be heading towards this futuristic world and Jonze blends those elements with this beautiful and sad love story. Her is philosophical at times and despite turning into a pretty much standard love story halfway through the film it still manages to be a great meditation on our need as humans for establishing connections (and they no longer need to be human connections). Her is a genuinely nostalgic romantic film that manages to touch its audience and speak to the heart.The story centers on Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) a letter writer who's been separated from his wife Catherine (Rooney Mara) for an year, but still hasn't found the strength to sign the divorce papers. He is very good at his job as he excels at expressing feelings through letters, but he's not doing so well at managing his own feelings around others. He is rather lonely and spends most of his time playing video games when he's not at work. He does have a very close friendship with his neighbors, Amy (Amy Adams) and Charles (Matt Letscher), especially with Amy as they both seem to share a sort of brother sisterly kind of love. His life turns around when he purchases a new artificially intelligent operating system, OS1, and immediately connects with Samantha (Scarlett Johansson), the voice behind the system. As they continue to spend more time together they begin falling in love with each other which excites Theodore because he's starting to feel alive again, but at the same time fills him with doubts and fears as he's conflicted about having a relationship with an operating system. Samantha also begins to grow intellectually as she experiences new things and is capable of having human emotions. Their unconventional love is what's explored in this film as the two connect and bond with each other.Jonze has crafted a very unique and original story which I found to be a great psychological study on human relations. I wish I would've connected more with this film as I've found it to be on most of my friends top 10 lists for best films of the year, and despite liking this film quite a bit it still didn't manage to make my list. The premise is very interesting and Jonze directs this film masterfully, but I couldn't help and feel that halfway through the film it does become a rather conventional love story (at times it felt like a normal long distance relationship) with some familiar trials that couples go through. I actually never felt a true connection in their relationship until a key moment near the end of the film and that is where I really bought their love story. The elements I connected the most with where the nostalgic feelings of lost love as we got to see some interesting flashbacks between Theodore and Catherine. I also loved the score of this film, the music was lovely and touching. I also enjoyed the social commentary quite a bit which never felt forced. The scene where Theodore is worried about how he will be perceived by his friends for having a relationship like this and how relieved he is when Amy approves is proof that we not only seek connections in life, but we also search for social approval. It's a clever and melancholic film and one that we can all come out of experiencing something completely different (and that is a good thing).",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
A good portrayal of artificial intelligence,"This movie seems to be a rare breed. It manages to portray artificial intelligence designed to simulated a human in a realistic manner while not making it stand out outside its boundaries. It managed to fit the sentient OS into environment where it felt natural and allowed for multitude of reactions from the cast that seems to cover a range of reactions to this new concept. The broad perspective of script writers really shine in the emotional field of dealing with Operating System becoming partner for lonely people. This of course would be all for naught if it weren't for the brilliant acting of the cast. Joaquin Phoenix was brilliant in his role but the supporting cast also seems to have done a good job.The focus on relationships and emotions may sway from the regular AI plot and some viewers may be disappointed, but i for one really like to see new perspectives on old plot devices, especially when they are done as well as they are here.the implications of such AI development as it approaches singularity is treated so gently and yet so powerfully it makes you wonder if the writer wasn't one of these writing geniuses themselves. u was truly amazed how they handled it and have never seen it done so well in any other movie previously.This is a great movie. it sucks you in at the very beginning and does not let you go.

One of my all-time favorite movies.,"Her is one of my all-time favorite movies because Spike Jonze uses an almost-sci-fi universe to create a brilliant sense of futuristic movement. The relationship between Theodore, a normal human (Joaquin Phoenix) and Samantha, an OSystem (Scarlett Johansson) becomes so intriguing just because of the beautiful soundtrack, acting and writing. There is nothing wrong at all with this film apart from a quite confusing ending, but the movie as a whole avoided that small distraction. It has a talented cast, and even though Chris Pratt and Amy Adams play small roles hey show dedication to their part and act very well. I do think it deserved all the Oscars it was nominated for and not one only for the screenplay. ""The Moon Song"" was brilliant, and it was equally as good as 12 Years a Slave and Gravity. It was Spike Jonze' biggest breakthrough yet and the fact the film is so original and unique makes it even better.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
beautiful movie and still sad,"this movie is very beautiful but still sad in a way. Joaquin Phoenix has done a great job, also Jonze. the idea of the script is brilliant and gives food for thoughts. i think the movie relates to people who are stuck in life, dealing with difficult situations, people who isolate themselves from real life and start an unrealistic habit, like sharing your life with an OS. it can also be related to all the devoted fans out there who are stuck in their imagination with their famous actor/actress, whom they have to share with thousands of others and will never have in real life.

This movie could be a masterpiece...if Samantha was believable as AI.,"I couldn't suspend my disbelief, so Samantha, the OS Theodore falls in love with, always seemed to me to be human actress Scarlett Johansen in a studio reciting dialog instead of a supremely advanced artificial intelligence, and that completely undermined the entire premise and emotional center of the film.There is much to like about Her as a drama about relationships, the performances are all top notch, and the idea of falling in love with a machine is more relevant than ever. If the filmmakers had used some creative, subtle device to help the audience believe that Samantha was artificial then this movie would come close to being a masterpiece about the heartbreak of being alive in a digital age.As it is, Her just didn't quite do it for Me.",4.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"Sensitive, strange and sad.","The idea of falling in love with a computer operating system probably seems outrageous and ridiculous, but in Her, Spike Jonze does a pretty good job at showing how this could soon enter the realms of possibility.Imagine; an artificially intelligent operating system, programmed to meet your every need, as well as possessing a friendly 'personality' and even an apparent consciousness. This is exactly what Joaquin Phoenix' character Theodore experiences and through his heart-warming, delicate performance, encourages you to empathise with this extraordinary situation, even if you might not understand or accept it.Scarlett Johansson's performance as Samantha, the voice of the operating system, is also far deeper than one would expect from a computer. She manages to convey an entire individuality within that piece of software.Although the complexity of adult relationships is depicted in an honest and refreshing way, it's difficult not to get sucked into Theodore's melancholic state and on occasion the film feels slow and empty. However, this reflects the character's bouts of loneliness and serves in highlighting the joy Samantha brings him. If anything, it's a reminder to cherish the positive relationships we have with significant others.The concept of falling head-over-heels for a computer is absurd. But as we continue to let our real lives merge with the virtual world, how long will it be until our dependence on technology slips into full on immersion?

"Amazing: Deep, thought provoking, relatable, and funny","I was pretty skeptical of the whole plot idea at first, but it worked fantastically. The entire movie (especially the characters) are extremely deep and relate-able, which is my favorite thing about it. It takes you on a self-reflecting roller-coaster, exploring thoughts and feelings that I think many people feel but either don't know, or don't like to admit. Their personal dynamics and relationships are amazing, and really pull everything together. But there are so many great parts to this movie, I can't recommend it enough. It touches on so many bases and different parts of life.

I mean it's alright,"Although this might not be the most entertaining film, It is a solid movie that explores the complexities of love and technology.Joaquin Phoenix's acting in the film is definitely a highlight, and it's the type of acting where you don't feel like you're watching him play a character. That's the thing about Joaquin Phoenix, he becomes the character he's playing like no other.I also like the style of the movie, Joaquin Phoenix has some pretty interesting fits and there are a few good shots.Overall, I think this is a film women can enjoy more than men, I found myself bored during most of the film, but I think that's just because I don't have enough emotions if that makes sense.

Pretty stupid,"""Her' is the type of movie that doesn't invite ambivalence; you either love it or ..um...you don't. It's numbingly slow, boring most of the time and pretty stupid.It had some good things, like the premise, which extrapolates from our already cyber-obsessed society to the near future. Here, people are even more disconnected from each other, to the point where computers and gadgets offer an emotional substitute. Interesting and could've been good. So lonely nice guy Theodore gets himself an OS for companionship. I'm thinking Scarlett's showing up in his apt as a saucy, android wench, fulsome lips and bosom at the ready. But no, she's just a computer program ... cold shower, Theo. She speaks though - and not like the robot from Lost in Space - but all breathy, giggly, half drunk, almost post-coital. And what a gal she/it is! Funny, caring, non-judgemental, bawdy and helpful ... suddenly, just like that! The perfect girlfriend. Trouble is, in order to convince us that it's possible for Theo to fall in love with 'Samantha' without the physical er, component, much talking between the two was required. And boy, did they talk and talk ... and talk. Did doze off a bit.So I understand now that this is a 'deep' movie; it's telling me that love conquers all, surpasses everything, including sexual urges, so no need for Theo to put his penis in a socket. What a load! Then comes a lot of dumb stuff: the masturbation scene, where Theo gets his hard drive up and nuts n' bolts Samantha actually 'climaxes.' Hahaha. Surely this would've been a good time for Sam to say ""I'm sorry Dave, I can't do that."" The ridiculous double date with the human couple - 3 mammals and a chip romping in the meadow! Not wishing to be cybephobic or specist or anything.Sick of masturbating and replacing semen-damaged USB's, Theo dumps Sam for a while. She's hurt, but understanding, as always. Then, seeing nothing's happening with Amy Adams, he misses her and wants her back, being the total invertebrate he is. But in the meantime, Sam's been playing around with a few thousand other computers - now that's just promiscuous! So they split up ... and who cares?! Weirdo Wahkin Phoenix put in a v. good performance, mostly because he could keep a straight face. The nondescript Amy Adams was surprisingly good, too, and it was an inspired choice to cast Johansson as the voice. Even though we couldn't see her, with that husky, slutty voice, da boiz can visualise her, loping around, pouting, whispering ""byte me."" Somehow, I don't think the 'love conquers all' theme would've worked if Fran Drescher did the voice.This film took a cool concept and made it boring, tiresome and silly. Fellas, stick to the hookers; they may not be as caring, but they still function when wet.Spoiler alert: Hell hath no fury like a laptop scorned 5 outta 10",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
A Love Letter to Humanity,"Her is one of those few films that come along and just sits perfectly for me. I had been waiting a long time for this film to be released and as I am English, longer than some. I always knew I would like this film as I am a keen science-fiction lover and have enjoyed Spike Jonze film-making in the past. Yet there was something about this film that embellished and enthralled me. It is simply beautiful. Her is unlike any other love story you are likely to come across in cinema, a man who falls in love with (at its core) his computer, an AI that gave itself the name Samantha voiced by Scarlett Johansson. Yet it is so much more than that as the title suggests, she or 'her' is not an it, she becomes human and is part of Joaquin Phoenix's character Theodore. She was created around his personality and as the film repeatedly reminds the audience, people grow and change together, becoming closer and drifting apart just like in a real relationship. They are helped with a variety of lovable and distant characters for narrative gains. My favourite of which is played by Chris Pratt, a character that shows that the fall of masculinity in men is actually something that should be embraced, not shunned. While at first glance of the plot summery, this might seem like an outlandish and borderline disturbing premise for a story, the film in many ways acknowledges this yet takes the viewer with these characters to the point where you actually believe they are real and their situations are these you and I have either experienced or will experience. The believability of the characters is in no small part aided by the brilliant script that is rich, deep and personal. And while watching the film, it answers all the questions exactly when you want them and leaves elements of the story open to interpretation in all the right places. The cinematography is also so lush and engaging by Hoyte van Hoytema, clearly the future will be bright through the eyes of people like him, which is also another key feature of the film I love, the science-fiction. It is not an unrealistic future where machines are conspiring to kill humans and aliens are invading. The few hints of the wider world in Her was very contemporary with technology clearly inspired by the latest tech we have now. Her is told with interesting, believable characters, presented in a way that rivals the visual splendour of Drive. There is little I did not enjoy with Her and in much the same way Theodore fell in love with Samantha, I have fallen in love with Her. I know this will be a film I think about for many years to come and I have only scratched the surface of the greater meanings of the film. This is truly a film that is not made often, a master class in film-making.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
the need to be loved,"Beautiful story that gives us Spike Jonze, who proves he can tell a story without Charlie Kaufman (Being John Malkovich and Adaptation). HER is a beautiful film and reminds us that, above all, everyone needs to love and be loved, no matter who or what.The chemistry between the different characters is superb. The atmosphere, the scenery, the dialogs, the key moments and the stunning art design make HER truly a gorgeous and moving film.I really enjoyed this movie a lot. I was excited, I distresses, I laughed, I cried ... In short, a whirlwind of emotions. That's HER. We all want someone (or something) to love us.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
It just may be a computer you're looking for...,"When I first heard about the film Her, I was filled to the brim with excitement and curiosity about the possibilities for the simple but thought-provoking story. However, I was fearful few would see the film as one that explores perhaps a forthcoming trend in relationships, and many would criticize the story's premise, dismissing it as ""weird"" or silly. Thankfully, writer/director Spike Jonze rises above the challenges of creating the film and effectively bypasses all preconceived notions of it being odd for the sake of being odd. Her is a tender, shockingly soulful picture that also serves as one of the most immersing depictions of a relationship I've yet to see.Set in an unknown time in the future, the film stars Joaquin Phoenix, a contemporary gem of an actor, as Theodore Twombly, an introverted loner whose job is to write personal love-letters for people who cannot effectively express their words. Theodore has withdrawn more and more from the world because of his impending divorce with Catherine (Rooney Mara), a woman he fell in love with when he was much younger, and resorts to buying an artificially intelligent operating system (OS for short). Theodore gives his OS a female identity, whom introduces herself as ""Samantha"" (voiced by Scarlett Johansson) upon booting up.It doesn't take long for Theodore to realize that Samantha has an uncanny ability to learn, grow, and analyze things like a real human being. Not only can she sort, clean, and upload the files on your hard-drive, but she can communicate one-on-one with Theodore and gives him not just a friend but a lovely romance between man and machine. She even has the unthinkable capability of analyzing feelings and present-emotions, making her almost all-knowing. The only thing she's missing is a body.Jonze's depiction of this romance could've been condescending; one that beats up its lead actor and portrays his vulnerability as a basic punchline. Instead, Jonze's depiction is tender, often meditative, resulting in a deeply intimate and softly-orchestrated relationship. This is one type of relationship that naturally has difficultly gaining momentum just because of the inevitable limitations of a machine as a significant other. However, Jonze never seems to run out of ideas for conversations between Theodore and Samantha, resulting in a beautiful, conversational intimacy missing from many modern romances.Before I even saw Her, but was open about my excitement to see it, my retired neighbor offered me keener insight into its material. ""I feel the film promotes isolationism and continues with our decline in social involvement and shows how we're all becoming more in more introverted into ourselves and our technology and simply shunning the outside world."" This was a great observation and identifies the technological age-gap when it comes to examining films about technology. However, Jonze portrays the outside world in Her to be a bit of a mystery as well. Almost everyone can still have honest, open conversations, and everyone is still talking out in public. However, they all appear to have something else going on at the same time, whether they have their own OS and have an earpiece in their ear, are listening to music, or simply talking on a cell phone. The particular American society portrayed in Her seems to be our current society upgraded a few notches, with Jonze still infusing the ideas of technological alienation with optimism for the future of face-to-face conversation and personal interactions. I hope to hell he's correct.Her, from a deeper, thematic standpoint, can mean quite a bit, depending on how you want to look at it. It's the kind of film where, I feel, the more I think about it, the more I'll have to say about it. As of now, I see Samantha as someone/something that gave Theodore the qualities of a human relationship with the human, while simultaneously making him appreciate the qualities humans possess. By the end, we see Theodore has an appreciation and a deeper recognition for two things, which I will not dare name here. Combining its themes with a practical visual scheme that makes the future look just plausible enough rather than overly-glossy and unrealistic, the film is a mental and visual stimulation in the proper form.On a final-note, one thing I hope is that while the extensive amount of themes, the content at hand, and the questions Her raises for the future need to be discussed and analyzed, Joaquin Phoenix's performance here should not be shortchanged. From what I have seen, this may indeed be Phoenix's strongest work, maybe even better than his embodiment of Johnny Cash in Walk the Line. Phoenix hits every note of Theodore Twombly's lonely, introverted character with stunning effectiveness and nuance, mainly the way Theodore's gentle mannerisms articulate his character's traits perfectly. Even Scarlett Johansson, whom exists simply as a voice, has the ability to woo and excite, despite her characters' obvious limitations. But the two together and it's a match made partially in reality and coding.I'm hoping Her will be a trendsetting film in the regard that its material will inspire more and more films showing relationships with technology or technological innovations. We've gotten quite a few in recent times, one of my favorites being Joe Swanberg's LOL, which focused on numerous relationships being set in motion and carried out almost entirely through the boundaries of cell phones, chatrooms, and webcam shows. But Her is much different, much more involved, and much more taken with creating this pragmatic dystopian world that, ten years ago, would've seemed so far-fetched it would've been laughed out of the theater.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
The Positives in the Human Condition,"A lonely writer (Joaquin Phoenix) develops an unlikely relationship with his newly purchased operating system (Scarlett Johansson) that is designed to meet his every need.If we say nothing else about 2013 in movies, we must concede the following: this was Spike Jonze's year. Matthew McConaughey has been a rising star, and both 2012 and 2013 were banner years for him. Amy Adams also gives a pair of winning performances with this film and ""American Hustle"". But Jonze, on top of writing and directing this film, was involved in two other Oscar nominees: ""Bad Grandpa"" and ""Wolf of Wall Street"". Is the man behind ""Adaptation"" and ""Being John Malkovich"" finally getting the full respect he deserves?What is most interesting about ""Her"" is that although it requires good acting to get its points across, the acting here is never the focus. Indeed, Phoenix received no nomination for his role (admittedly not his strongest performance) and Johansson was not even on set -- her lines were dubbed over the original actress! The two big nominations for this film are both for Jonze, one for writing and the other for best picture. Jonze won the Golden Globe for his writing, and I would not be terribly surprised if he took the Oscar, as well.The best film of 2013 for elucidating the darkest parts of the human condition is ""Act of Killing"", a documentary set in Indonesia. But ""Her"" nails the positive aspects in a very touching and sincere way. Humans are great creators of artwork of many kinds, but their greatest asset is the ability to love. We are capable of loving everyone in a general sense and individuals in a very deep way that probably no other creature can match.Can we love a machine? Other films and novels have tackled this, generally accepting that if a machine takes on human form it could be quite possible. With ""Her"" we go a step further -- no physical form whatsoever, just a disembodied voice with a near-infinite intelligence. Is such a thing capable of loving or being loved? This film suggests yes, and makes a strong argument for that.But the underlying theme is that humans are meant to love humans. As much as we can confide in a computer and even open our hearts to it, there would always be something missing. Perhaps the physical touch (a single hug can be powerful), but even the ability to relate. Could a computer ever fully ""get"" the full range of human emotion?As much as many of us look forward to a future with more intelligent computers, and would be willing to accept the widespread popularity of high pants and bad mustaches, there is a comfort in knowing that human beings will always be important to other human beings for the foreseeable future. As Eden Ahbez wrote, ""The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return.""Is this the best picture of 2013? Probably not. Is it the best screenplay? Possibly. But regardless of what the Academy decides, this is a film worth seeing by everyone (except maybe kids).",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
The Evolution of Relationships,"A teacher of mine once said during class while taking a students phone away, ""You guys act like I am cutting off your arms, I mean seriously guys, someday soon we are going to have rehab for people who can't let go of their technology and some of you will probably be there."" This pretty much sums up the direction we are heading.Spike Jonze returns to full length films after 4 years of doing shorts and music related documentaries. His unique sense of placing the weird and the obscure right out there yet still acting as if it is commonplace is apparent in the film. Technology is everywhere in the film, everybody has a little earpiece that acts as a phone in the apparently near future, something that isn't entirely far-off from what we have now. So when the new OS 1 is released (imagine Siri on steroids) just like any sort of release of technology in our world, it has become somewhat expected. Theodore is a lonely and depressed letter writer for a company which takes information given by someone and transforms it into a personalized message for the person they are sending it to. Theodore excels at his work, but he is consistently reminded by those around him that he is devoid of any sort of emotionality.Joaquin Phoenix, in easily one of his best performances, is incredible. His separation from his wife, Catherine, played by Rooney Mara, has taken a toll on his life even though it happened a year prior. He has not been able to move on, and his somber and heartbreaking appearance makes it all the much more painful for us when he reminisces on the times he shared with his ex. On a whim, he buys the OS 1 and is introduced to Samantha, voiced by Scarlett Johansson, his own personal artificial intelligence who is designed to do all of his organizing and whatnot. Her voice is alluring, we almost want to have her somehow materialize and be real; it's as if she is hiding around the corner or just simply not in frame. But, just like how our technology is advancing, she begins to take a life of her own.Thus begins his relationship with a computer, which like Jonze is so good at, doesn't appear all too bizarre. Samantha is more or less the personification of what technology is to us in our world. We all love our technology, we all hate our technology, we race to plug it in when it's low on battery, we have a panic attack if we lose it or it doesn't work, we sometimes get so sick of it we just have to push it away. It is a love-hate relationship. Technology has become so necessary to daily life and just like we have become so reliant on technology, Theodore becomes inseparable from Samantha. It is such a challenge to act like you are actually speaking to someone who isn't there, surely Scarlett was somewhere on set, but Joaquin takes the challenge head on, delivering a great performance when it is mainly just him talking to a voice that is literally inside his head. He falls head over heels for her. She is so new to the world that she wants nothing more than to see, well, everything. Her desire to learn gets Theodore out of his shell as he begins to open up and learn to love life again. Their relationship feels real; we follow the jealousy of the other talking to different people, the misery of fighting with the other person, and the happiness when things are OK.The movie itself is beautiful; it is filled with beautiful set designs and gorgeous cinematography. The amount of detail put into the entire tech-pieces in the film is astonishing, it leaves one to want the computers they are using and the video games they are playing.The movie is also about coming out of our shells that we have surrounded ourselves with, in a world so full of technology and artificial conversations through Facebook and texting, we forget that the real interactions are the most powerful; the touch of a lover, the high five of two friends, holding hands in the park. This movie shows us that through technology we lose that level of connection; sure we can talk from hundreds of miles away through the phone, but it isn't the same and never will be.The supporting cast isn't entirely present, but it is strong nonetheless. Chris Pratt plays Theodore's receptionist friend, but he is the least seen of the supporting cast. He is pretty funny, never judging Theodore for his romance with Samantha. It is Amy Adams who is much stronger. She is Theodore's friend from college, and they rely on each other for support. She is sometimes the heart of the film, reminding us that love is more of a ""socially accepted form of insanity"" and that it's all about finding joy in the time we spend here on earth.Her is by far one of the best movies of the year. The acting is superb and the story is unique and daring. Most directors who would try their hand at the idea of a romance with an artificial intelligence may find themselves making it funnier than poignant, more of a cheap gimmick than a message about how our world is and the way our society is heading. It is a tricky subject, but Jonze handles it with ease, never making it seem like the technology is the more important part of the film, focusing on the relationships, making it his best movie in over ten years, and also making a film that speaks so much truth about our world today, where we forget that the ideas in the movie are not so far from fiction than we might think.For more of my reviews, check out ragingfilm.wordpress.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"Well made, but utterly clueless","Phoenix plays Theodore who buys a version of the first Interactive, Artificially Intelligent Operating Systems somewhere in the near future. For some obscure reason, people manage to develop personal relationships with these operating Systems including, but not limited to, sexual experiences. Theodore 'falls in love' with his OS and some ridiculous and obvious complications ensue.Apart from a well thought out depiction of what the world would look like if we manage to maintain our childlike game/app dependency, the film offers no deeper philosophies or intellectual thought. It in stead meanders around the thoroughly unbelievable premise of some guy falling in love with his PC while he's playing 3D, holographic games in his living room. Why Samantha, his OS, couldn't think of a way to interface with this holographic technology to surrogate a body, but in stead hires some weirdo to pass off as a go between, is never even touched upon.In short, the film gets a few ideas right in terms of extrapolating our near future but fails to also give us an incentive to care about the main characters or the implications of enhanced PC/Phone technology. There is nothing in terms of plot or screenplay worthy of more than just a few chuckles. MST3K came to mind several times.. A wasted opportunity.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

"Her may not win it all, but its definitely the best-directed film of 2013","Leave it to Spike Jonze to create an expensive sci-fi movie that can still manage its heavy indie roots and tone.Her is a beautifully directed comedic drama that gives a major twist to your typical lonely-boy-meets-girl film. Spike Jonze continues to impress with his ability to keep the audience engaged no matter how unique the scenario is. His biggest strength is allowing you to be embedded within the environment no matter what the circumstance is, whether it's inside the imagination of a child or inside the mind of a well-known actor.The concept here is heavy science fiction, but believable science fiction in the style of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Her follows a lonely writer that starts a relationship with an operating device (sexily voiced by Scarlett Johansson) in a futuristic world that lacks communication and intimacy between people as technology has separated everyone into their own little world. The movie paints a future in which the technology makes life easier and smoother, but makes it much harder for humans to interact and seek out their vital emotions.Oscar-worthy performances also help carry this movie. Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely amazing as the nice, shyly vulnerable writer that continues to struggle getting over a past relationship. Phoenix flawlessly displays the raw depression that comes with having to separate from someone you loved and have spent a good hunk of your life with. And then there is Scarlett Johansson who manages to make you forget that she is just a computer program with her voice. Being able to convey all her emotions using just her vocal chords gives her one of the better voice-over performances since Ellen DeGeneres in Finding Nemo.Spike Jonze is the biggest strength, but also its biggest weakness. Although he skillfully directs Her with a dazzling mix of technical wit and Sundance flair, his script misses the knockout punch as the movie lounges in the final act. It is a tough enough concept, and felt like it was a great idea that had trouble coming up with the proper ending. Even with the amazing amount of detail, visual hints, and superb use of color, the wonderful ride ends all too abruptly and a bit too soon.The one advantage of Eternal Sunshine over this movie is that it had a delightful ending that wrapped up the entire story perfectly. For a movie so heavy in detail and dialogue, ambiguity can really stand out and Her does exactly that crossing the two hour threshold. Nonetheless, all the technical work from the cinematography to the art design was flawless. Just like the other Oscar contender Gravity, the visuals and direction more than make up for a script that could have used some polishing.Her is definitely a film that will not win Best Picture because it's a bit jagged for the typical crowd and because of its explicit science fiction atmosphere (Honestly, name a sci-fi movie that won Best Picture), but it clearly stands as one of the best films of 2013 and another display as to why Spike Jonze is one of the best directors in the business.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

"Interesting theme, but weak ending","With most movies you need to supply a bit of ""suspended disbelief"", and ""Her"" is no exception. From a technical point of view, it is hard to imagine an OS as sophisticated (and sexy), right out of the box. Not so hard to imagine a mal-adjusted techhie, but more than once his irritating personality merits a two-by-four upside the head. Surprisingly impressive is Johansson's expertly delivered dialog. Given Scarlett's looks, the viewer is justifiably focused on her in other movies, more so than on her delivery. Amy Adams is entirely convincing as a nerdy girl - right down to the semi-vapid look in her eyes. The plot is sort of believable, but decidedly disappointing in the vague and unresolved ending. Maybe in some circles this is considered creative, but in my view Jonze just couldn't come up with a good, satisfying conclusion.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Sentimental pseudo-techno-tripe,"Spike Jonze/Adam Spiegel sets up easy-to-knock-down situations, taking pot shots at generic targets which have no bulls-eyes at their center, just great big easy-to-hit circles.

Yes, people seem to spend more time talking into machines than with each other. Wasn't that the complaint about A.G. Bell's new contraption?

This is a paean for the generation that looooooves to Kvetch. Any 3 minutes of Silicon Valley is orders of magnitude superior to this uninspired pulp.To live a life w/o hope or humor, creativity or imagination is deeply disturbing, but to depict such a life in a film which is itself (deliberately or not) devoid of hope, humor, creativity or imagination is inexcusable.

the future??,"I know so many people who do not like this film but I really liked it. I was fascinated with the electronics - the games, the ability to tell an OS what to do and have it done in minutes. I am not electronic savvy and don't know if I ever will be and one of my pet peeves is the ways people are so plugged into their devices and do not communicate with each other in person. I strongly feel that so many people are missing out on REAL people. Joaquin Phoenix is so good as Theo - and it is easy to see why he is falling for Samantha. He is going through a divorce, he is very introverted and has no life. He just writes computer generated letters for others. Samantha gives him a life when she wants to learn more and see more and he becomes dependant on her, for him to have a life. I loved his apartment but wanted to decorate it. The room sized gaming looked so fun - but it also got frustrated with him. This movie generated some very interesting conversation afterwards.

A Moving Look at a Not-So-Distant Future,"Her is a contemporary film that tells the story of a man who falls in love with his computer operating system. Sounds bizarre, right? But is it good, let alone believable?Joaquin Phoenix delivers a perfect performance as the main character, Theodore. Her is a very character-driven film and great chemistry between the actors and actresses is necessary as well as dialogue that isn't corny, and in Her, Phoenix does a lot of staring off into space because he's listening to Samantha, not physically interacting with her because she isn't a physical being. He conveys so much emotion with just his face. He's perfectly cast.Scarlett Johansson gave one of her best performances as Samantha, the operating system. She was completely snubbed at most of the award shows for Best Supporting Actress and her performance showed so much emotional depth just through her voice.Spike Jonze's screenplay is easily one of the best of the year. It's plot is so refreshing, original and engaging that it's hard not to get caught up in this story. The film's screenplay has its fair share of funny moments while also being insanely thought-provoking and most of the time, moving. Each character feels very complex and each character has multiple layers. It's fascinating to see characters this emotionally developed and real. And one of the best things about this screenplay is that it doesn't always take its bizarre concept incredibly seriously. Jonze knows his film's plot is bizarre and doesn't treat it like it isn't. Jonze is very self-aware and insightful.The cinematography in Her is immaculate and was definitely subbed for Achievement in Cinematography in the Academy Awards for Hoyte Van Hoytema's beautiful work. The film also has an interesting color- palette, consisting mostly of pinks and reds and light blues which give the film a unique, vibrant look. The score for the film is equally brilliant and contributes to the vibrant, colorful feel that's present throughout.Her is a beautiful, poignant film that explores adult relationships to the extreme while also exploring how huge technology is modern culture and how close humans and their computers are becoming. Her explores human emotions until there's little left to explore. It blends social commentary with very real characters so effortlessly and is still visually-striking. Her is a genius film and one of my favorite films of all time.Read all my reviews at www.thecheapseatsfilmreviews.weebly.com!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
You've Got Mail,"Boy meets OS. A digitized love story, far ahead of it's time in what's increasingly looking like our future (for better or worse). Her is an exceptional idea for a film that presents it's thesis in fascinating and inventive ways. Scarlett Johansson's best performance might be this one, as Samantha. An unseen performance, conveying every proper human emotion flawlessly. This should have garnered her a Best Supporting Actress nomination, at the very least. Imagine the challenge of visually articulating a virtual relationship. My hat goes off to Spike Jonze. But what to make of Joaquin? Slowly getting into his element pre-Joker. He's fine, but I wasn't always on board with his personality as the timid Theodore Twomley. He's a flat line of emotion. Always unsure of himself and wishy-washy. We get glimpses of confidence, but throughout, he remains and one-note, uninteresting character. Samantha carries this thing.

Fantastic,"Breathtakingly beautiful and incredibly heartbreaking, her is not only a great film, but a tour-de force. Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely fantastic as his character Theodore, providing such clarity to the character in a way that is both refreshing, honest, and brilliantly frustrating in the best way imaginable. For a voice performance, Scarlett Johansson does more than shine, but also bring life to a character so well executed, you can't help but feel for both their characters. All the supporting characters also provide with memorable and well fitting performances. The films script is really what ties it together, providing for such a beautiful and emotional ride that's both utterly entertaining and hard to watch. In the end, her is a film that is unlike no other, and something that can never truly be replicated with half the emotional impact as before. It's an absolutely stunning piece of work that will not only stand the test of time, but grow smarter because of it.

It'll leave you with this crippling sense of loneliness, but like the comforting kind.... or at least comforting most of the time, unbearable other times, but nonetheless, it's definitely more romanticized in a sense where you don't want to choke on shards of glass at the thought of being unloveable forever 😏You would have to actually be DUMB to not enjoy this film and if you don't you're just bitter and tired of being by yourself, loser.

This film was amazing, the simplicity and the sci-fi features made this movie... a work of art, a movie that is probably on the top of my favorite movies.

Timeless,"The heart of ""Her"" lies in its exploration of emotions and how they shape our connections with technology. Theodore's relationship with Samantha is a poignant portrayal of how AI can fulfill emotional needs, offering companionship and understanding that seem almost human. The film deftly captures the intimate and often blurred lines between human emotions and artificial intelligence.Watching ""Her"" makes you ponder the broader implications of AI on our lives. It raises questions about how technology shapes our interactions and decisions, and how much of our personal data is being collected and used by tech companies. The film subtly nudges us to consider the ethical and privacy concerns surrounding AI, making us aware of the power these systems hold over our personal information and choices.""Her"" remains a beautiful, thought-provoking film that raises important questions about the role of AI in our lives, making it a must-watch as we navigate the complexities of the AI era.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Important film for the 21st Century,"I reserve the right to add a tenth star after I watch this again. This film hits on so many points and levels. Far and away Joaquin Phoenix's best work ever. And, yet another serious and thoughtful, yet still fun, funny and positive work from Spike Jonze. This film has both substance and style in abundance. I concur with most every other positive comment made by other reviewers. The treatment of a near future society was done so intelligently with just the right touch of humor and farce, yet with enough realism to make one's reflections and comparisons to current day existence both accessible and thoroughly satisfying and enjoyable. I also absolutely loved the clothing and wardrobe selections made for the characters and the entire color palette for the film in general.Great film for kids of all ages to watch both with or without their parents as well.

Just Fantastic,"The filmmaker behind movies like ""Being John Malkovich"" (1999) or ""Adaptation"" (2002) is back, four years after his last long feature film, ""Where the Wild Things Are"" (2009). ""Her"" is a beautiful, dense and mesmerizing movie, only different from mainstream tendencies in its own development. It is the work of a mature auteur, surprisingly accessible yet completely personal, and that is quite a statement nowadays.""Her"" takes place in an aseptic near future, and narrates the story of Theodore, a lonely letter writer, divorced and trapped inside a routine that keeps him just half alive. Only his neighbors seem to have some kind of contact with him, as well as the receptionist of his job. Everything changes when he decides to buy a new and sophisticated Operative System and meets Samantha.Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic as the melancholic writer Theodore, lonely and daydreamer. His looks, manners and specially his voice really fits into such a mellow character we relate to almost instantly. His is the portrait of a man in a near future society, crowded yet emotionally empty at the same time.Scarlet Johansson is Samantha, whose easy-going character lights up the life of Theodore, though theirs might be an impossible love. Johansson's voice is absolutely fantastic, so subtle and warm that elevates her status as an actress to those who still believe she is just a pretty face (and body) and their interaction is far more real and touching than most modern films.""Her"" is pure American Cinema, dense and layered as only worth telling stories can be. This is the story of an impersonal society, to such extent that Theodore writes letter for other people who does not have time, patience or their own emotions, to do so. It embodies the failure of intimate human contact. Such change in human behavior seems an overreaction to some, but it is also true that some might say it is just an ongoing tendency. In this futuristic society, where human contact is every time less and less frequent, the story of Theodore and Samantha is more and more likely to happen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

So much more than the premise suggests...,"I catalog and star-rate every movie I see on my own private database, though I seldom actually write reviews. I finally decided to watch ""Her"" though I was a little ambivalent about whether I'd appreciate some seemingly silly concept of falling in love with one's computer. I thought it must be a quirky, light-hearted little sci-fi comedy poking fun at today's society, and in the back of my mind I still had a rather soured perception about Joaquin Phoenix from his annoying and ingenuous publicity stunt from a few years back. Now after watching the film, I realize it is all that to an extent ...yet so much more as well.It's a commentary on loneliness, the human condition, and our increasing dependence on social media and computer technology that are all dealt with honestly, realistically and non-judgmentally, yet not intentionally comically. I would say it's all really more ""ironic"" than ""comedic"". Most movies I see are ones I think I'll like so I do end up giving them 3, 3.5 or 4 stars out of 5, although there are a few disappointments. I sometimes scan over my collection of classics that I rated five stars and am reminded why. How nice it is now to, surprisingly, be so moved in ways I never expected that I can gladly give it a full 5 stars. Its relevance and emotional honesty says so much of what I've been thinking about life in today's world as compared to when I grew up. I am at once appreciative that I was and am still young enough to continue to witness all the amazing and rapidly advancing computer technology in recent years and in those sure to come, yet oh so grateful that I grew up in a time not so advanced that we unwittingly sacrificed genuine human interaction and a sense of real community for the enticing, exciting yet somewhat isolating allure of the digital age. I am again reminded to view social media and computer technology as an amazing tool to attain the kinds of real-life connections I inherently desire and not, as I see happening more and more, as a substitute for them.

I enjoyed Where The Wild Things Are and I do appreciate the work he did when producing Jackass cause I'm a huge fan of them movies and TV series.Initially though I was so wrong about this movie. The observational views and the way movie let you inside this man's mind and listen and feel every emotion he had. Scarlett Johansson provides a brilliant voice for Samantha and I couldn't picture it being anyone else's voice. Jonze really provided me with love, care, sadness, aggression.

Her - A Review by Brandon Krzysztof,"When I first read the premise of this movie I said, ""Hmm, did this film really get the green light?"" and then it occurred to me that this has the potential to be one the most unique and original films that has came out recently. I still thought it was silly, but I think all the iPhone screenshots of people messing with Siri and trying to get her to say silly things and then it finally came to me that I was really interested and wanting to see this film.Her takes place in the near future where technology has grown and has become an essential part of people's lives. Whether if it is for work, pleasure, or even both; technology plays a huge role. Joaquin Phoenix plays Theordore, a guy who is currently going through a divorce and battling loneliness while not being able to move on stop thinking of his soon-to-be ex-wife. Theodore then comes across the ad for a state of the art new operating system that calibrates itself to understand and help it's user with whatever they need. Theodore soon becomes very fond of the operating system, who gives itself the name Samantha, and continues to talk and build an actual relationship with Samantha and eventually he starts dating her.The first thing that struck a chord with me is the excellent job of story telling. I feel like each scene builds the characters more and more and before we know it we become emotionally involved with them; especially Theodore. With each day, they become closer and closer and Samantha is bringing him joy and helping him move on from his past relationship and transforming him as we view each scene. But not only is Theodore transforming, but also Samantha. Joaquin Phoenix is very impressive in this movie and his performance is definitely one to remember come awards season. I found myself rooting for Theodore because he actually found someone who he can have a conversation with and who understands him and you see him so happy and forgetting the things that caused him stress and pain. But even in relationships with people, it can have its downs and it is really interesting to see how Theodore deals with them considering that she is programmed to meet his every need. Watching the relationship grow and blossom and Theodore react with it is such a sight to see.Another thing that is impressive about this film is the humor. This film delivers some great laughs, both raunchy and sarcastic, and they come in some of the greatest moments of the film. The cinematography of the film is beautifully done and the whole setting and world that this film takes place in is very neat. It shows how much of the world is dependent on technology and how it becomes an actual part of us. The acting all around is superb as well as the voice work of the operating system by Scarlet Johansson. But Spike Jonze is really the reason why this film is so good. His writing and direction of this film spot on and his views on relationships, emotions, and feelings are spectacular. Why can't you fall in love with an OS? If it's returning feelings, emotions, and making you feel good inside; why fight it?This film does have a strange premise, but Spike Jonze and Joaquin Phoenix deliver an interesting film that will make all of us think about not only love, but technology as well and how we use that technology. To be in love, does an actual body need to present? Or can it be just a voice in our ear coming from a computer. I found this film touching, funny, and unique and I definitely recommend that people should see it. If I had to sum this whole movie with one word it would be interesting because with this plot, that is really what it is.4.5 out of 5 starsbkstareviews.blogspot.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Stood the test of time.,"I watched this movie for the first time in 2023. 10 years after it debuted in theaters. It's hard to believe it came out in 2013, when the content of the movie feels much more prevalent today with all of the AI and technological advancement. It felt like something that could really be happening today. Considering the technology that was available when this movie was written, it felt almost like a prediction.Quality of writing:For the most part, this movie was brilliantly written. The dialogue fit well, the concepts and main ideas worked great. The aesthetic of the film itself was beautifully shot and the creativity of it all really surprised me. I thought listening to a disembodied voice for a few hours would bore me, but it wasn't like that at all.The only con I have for the writing was likely somebody else's main pro. Some of the lines and scenes that were added for comedic value felt out of place to me. Some of the lines were crude and shocking for no seeable reason. They were funny, just felt weird in the moment.Characters:Not much to say about the characters. They were all amazing. Joaquin Phoenix is amazing in nearly everything he does, as is Scarlett Johansson. His acting was amazing and so was her voice over (she has such a pretty voice).Plot:Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix's character) works at a job where he writes love letters for other peoples' significant others. This clear separation of human relationships in this movie is seen from the get go. Theodore meets Samantha, the equivalent of an advanced AI bot that learns more as you speak to it. Throughout the film, Theodore struggles with the morality of loving and Samantha struggles with the ideas of humanity. It all works very well, with plenty of touching moments.Watch it.

The two big problems are the slow pace of the film and the almost total lack of any sense of humor. About 45 minutes in I was about ready to tune out. My mind started to drift as there wasn't enough substance to sustain the plot. Editing out about thirty minutes would have helped a lot. The bigger sin is the dry, lifeless presentation. Why Spike Jonze decided to make this a humorless endeavor baffles me. All the wit exhibited in his previous films was missing here.

The definitive love story of the digital age...,"Ever since I heard the concept of Her, I was greatly intrigued. Choosing to make a serious, non-comedic movie about a relationship between a man and an artificial intelligence is something that could have easily turned out terribly, what with the general idea of falling in love with a computer being looked down upon in society. In fact, there was one point during a sex scene that's so bizarre yet serious, where I stopped and thought; why am I not laughing at this? Because in the hands of any other director, Her could have turned out to be unbelievable and laughable at how ridiculous it is, but under the careful guidance of Spike Jonze, Her is a 100% believable, grounded tale of love that's one of the most unique ever made.The screenplay for Her is absolutely stunning. The writing is incredible and probably the best original screenplay of 2013. The situation is fairly absurd yet it feels very believable, with excellently shaped characters and a vision of the future that looks as though it could actually happen within the next few years. The script has everything you would want from a movie like this; comedy, drama, romance and a small bit of sci-fi.Joaquin Phoenix is phenomenal in the lead role, he suits the character perfectly and deserves some awards recognition for his performance. Scarlett Johansson is also outstanding, she pulls off such a memorable performance considering that we never actually see her in the movie, only hear her voice. Amy Adams is excellent, she gives a performance that's easily one of the best of her whole career, and the whole supporting cast, including Chris Pratt and Rooney Mara, are also great.Spike Jonze does a brilliant job directing, capturing a lot of emotion on screen.

Sci-Fi That's Smaller But Far More Superior,"First of all, I'm incredibly glad to see such an unconventional and original story (that wasn't based off of yet another novel) in this day and age. What can definitely be found in this film is an incredibly fascinating concept. Theodore Twombly (played by Joaquin Phoenix) lives in the future where technology is ever more convenient- doing everything you want it to at the utterance of a few words- and the newest addition introduces any who're interested to an OS that's able to serve as a romantic companion, deeply discussing the way of the world with you and engaging in phone sex when the arousal starts to sink in. It makes you think of how much more comfortable or widely different the future will be from the present day. The idea of virtual companions might not suit everyone, but the idea, in and of itself, is undoubtedly intelligent and complex nonetheless. This partner is void of any imperfections that plague the common female (or male); it knows you inside out and can converse about the subjects you actually enjoy. Consequently, the quantity of argument is dramatically reduced and the sound of genuine laughter and sheer joyousness permeates in its stead. Now, the more shallow and insensitive of individuals might find such an idea highly bothersome and strange, but in essence, this picture attempts to question the boundaries of love. Does love have to be inextricably conventional and tied to the societal norms like everything else in this world?I admire the fact that these characters, for once in a Hollywood production and this mightily perverted society, didn't get right down to sex. There's much more to love than the sexual intercourse- something that might act equally as sensational. Of course, the hard-hearted alpha males will laugh at such talk, but the romantic and truly loving will adore its implications. Throughout the movie's duration, we see the impressive amount of comfort and intimacy shared between Theodore and his OS/computer (Samantha, played by Scarlett Johansson). Like with the ""Before"" trilogy, Her shows the most heartwarming of relationships: when the couple actually get along verbally and share each other's profound knowledge of the fascinating aspects of life. Right then and there, you sight the authenticity and their pleasure for each other's company. A narrow-minded individual would quickly realize the impossibility of having sex with this entity and tend elsewhere. With this rapidly-developing relationship, the audience is able to discern the fundamental depths of true love.Anyways, Joaquin Phoenix, once again, proves why he's one of the most talented actors in the business today- a terrific performance. I absolutely love how this guy can transform into anyone- from a nefarious tyrant to a deranged, lost soul and now to a sweet and wholly goodhearted dude. The role of Samantha is arguably Johansson's finest showing- her variegated and vehement voice, as it stands alone, proves that Johansson is a perfectly capable actress. The screenplay, in addition, allows for the richness and delightful unraveling of this unorthodox relationship. Quite popularly this year, I discovered a fair share of humor in this smart narrative. Honestly, I was continually cracking up during its first half before it took on a more dramatic tone in order to address the serious thematic material behind this entire notion. Though I found it faltering in its second half, I was persistently amused and engrossed in its first half as we begin to learn of how this distant future exactly functions and are introduced to the fascinating machine that suddenly slips into Theodore's life. Furthermore, though on a much smaller scale, like with Cuaron's Children of Men, a whole new type of world (immensely metropolitan and urbanized) is created and (cleverly) deliberately revealed thanks to Jonze's ingenious vision.With all that praise being given, I have to reiterate how disappointed I was with its closing minutes. For one, I didn't appreciate the slightly ""Hollywood-ized"" and seemingly unnatural ending. I won't go into spoilers (as much as I loved to talk more in-depth in reviews, I obviously can't), but it was exactly what I was expecting. You knew where these particular characters would end up at the end of the story, and so, I found that somewhat uninspired and compromising. The theme, if I'm right, felt simplistic (compared to the abstract nature the premise of the film promised). I also didn't agree with what the film seemed to be saying about this entire image after presenting a fairly balanced voice on the state of relationships and the various paths they're allowed to take. During its running, you could clearly detect the negatives and positives of dating a normal human being versus a virtual partner and the other way around. Its ending just wasn't as memorable and satisfying as the rest of the film seemed to be indicating. At the end of the day, I found Her to be a breath of fresh air in the sci-fi realm (its execution of the genre far superior to any of the bombastic 100-million-dollar blockbusters this year) - remarkably magnificent in its world-building, featuring an unbelievably pleasing tale (at first), and forcing us to question the conventionality of society's idea of love and relationships in general.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Spike Jonez's Masterpiece (What It Makes Me Feel),"Simply overwhelming. In love with an OS (Samantha), a bizarre idea at first, but the beauty with which the love relation between an OS and a human is presented is outstanding.

What follows later on is a strange but beautiful metamorphosis of love, sharing, truth and honesty. A constant reprisal of the fact that Samantha has no body is transcended by the presence of the true essence of love that prevails through out the movie.Towards the end a surprising departure of Samantha brings up yet another harsh reality of love i.e. BREAKUP.

Luring futuristic film,"I watched this movie because I liked the situation of falling in love with an OS, it seemed very futuristic.Loneliness of the future is the main subject of this film. Everyone is looking for somebody to connect with, either sexually or socially. I think that's a pretty close assumption of the upcoming years.The main character of this movie falls in love with his computer's OS, which has its own personality and as expected, it flourishes into a fully functional yet bodiless human being.Although this affair, in the beginning, seems not to have any future, gradually becomes more and more stable and is starting to feel like a real relationship.The one thing I didn't like about this movie is that the ending is not what I really expected based on the rest of the film. For 100 minutes everything that happens is explained, the last 20 minutes were, for me at least, very confusing, and if I may say, without any particular reason.This movie left me with a bitter taste in the end that's why my rating is an 7 out 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

A brilliant modern love tale,"Her manages to take an idea that could sound creepy to some, and turn it into a truly captivating love story. I will show you in great detail why it is so brilliant but first I have something I want to get out of the way, unfortunately I don't believe everyone will enjoy this film. This film is for mature moviegoers who will look at it as a work of art and not a two hour popcorn flick. Also you really have to be mature about the whole guy in love with a computer thing or you might be disturbed by it. When I walked out of the theatre I heard a lot of people saying they hated the movie because it was too weird. This really saddens me because I was one of the only people in the theatre who liked it, I guess just keep in mind not everyone will like it. Now that I have that out the way I will base upon all the things that make this movie so great, first I will talk about the acting. Joaquin Phoenix turns a believable and heartfelt performance as Theodore Twombly that might just be his best yet. He captures the feelings of love, and loneliness in a very believable way. Scarlett Johansson also does a very good job as Samantha and captures those very same emotions without ever being in front of the camera. Another thing I would like to touch base upon is the very creative and fitting visual style. These visuals are so well directed that the film at times looks like a work of art. These visuals also perfectly complement the film and just raise an already great film to the next level. Last but not least I would love to touch base upon the wonderful writing and directing from Spike Jonze. Spike Jonze wrote a very old fashion love story but was able to make it very fresh and new. Also his script was able to perfectly balance comedy and drama. Finally his heartfelt directing was some of the best I have ever seen in a romantic film. Overall the film in my opinion was very impressive and oddly enough it portrays a relationship more realistically then most films with two real people in love. This is a romantic film that will stand the test of time and will be remembered years ahead.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Her - Expression of the Soul,"A man struggling with connecting to woman as a result of a recent divorce decides to get an Operating System that manages to be self aware, intuitive and lovely. He falls in love with Samantha, as she calls herself. But can a human have a real relationship with an operating system?I loved being in this world. Jonze creates an incredible world in which he depicts a future that seems not too far away. Bright colours and fashion from our history, such as high waist pants, blends awkwardly well with the advancement of technology showcased here. Not once did I ever think that in our near, or distant future, that we would not achieve what Jonze envisions here.All of Jonze's films are high concept, Being John Malkovich, Where The Wild Thing Are, etc...you'll see a lot of melancholy. Her fits well with his resume, but comes off as a more mature and held back piece. I was invested in the characters, more so than any other film this year. Hell, Her depicts the most honest and real relationship this year and one of them is nothing but ones and zeros. Both characters here are yearning for something more, Theodore, played by Phoenix yearns for connection. He needs to be with someone, but can't emotionally because he still wants to be with his wife. Samantha, voiced by Scar-Jo, yearns to be more than an operating system. She wants to feel, learn, be alive. This film mirrors what these characters go through, which is self discovery.The film doesn't look at the technology as our saviour, nor does it look at it as our curse. It's simply part of our lives and the use of this allows us to examine relationships in a slightly new way. We are disconnected from people due to our devices, but we feel more connected with people because of them. The film manages to make the viewer wrestle with the question, what makes us human? Especially with an AI character and having so many people in the film walk around, in a zombie state, connected to their highly advanced devices. All the people Theodore sees in one way or another mirror him. They all have their ear pieces in, connecting with technology.Phoenix is marvellous here. I'm not a huge fan of him, but I simply loved his performance here. I believed everything he did here and I think it had to do with his eyes. He invokes such sympathy with just his eyes, that Phoenix the actor disappears and Theodore the awkwardly emotionally detached AI lover emerges. He tries to fill his void of loneliness with the technology, as do most of the characters depicted in the film.Amy Adams shows up as a neighbour to Phoenix and best friend. She's here to showcase to us that he is able to talk to and connect with a human being, he's not necessarily this recluse. This is a nice counter to the technology aspect. There is a brother-sister relationship here, which was crucial for the film. This helps us to see the technology as more of a tool for the characters, than simply a good or bad aspect of our future.Her is heartfelt, funny and depressing. If your asking yourself, can a human and an OS have sex? Her answers this question, in a unique way that lets us focus on the sound and not the visuals. Her is without a doubt extremely inventive in the way it approached and handled the typical generic genre about romance and relationships. Her is one of the best films of the year and I highly recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"Digital love, human emotion. Another 'Wow!' from one of Hollywood's most inventive directors.","In the not-too-distant future, Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix), a writer who earns his living composing heartfelt letters for other people, is alone, lonely, almost divorced from Catherine (Rooney Mara), and playing video games with characters that are abusive to him. Seduced by an impressive ad campaign, Theodore buys a new operating system, answers a few questions, selects a female voice and 'meets' Her.The Her in question is OS1, aka Samantha (Scarlett Johansson), but, as the commercial states, ""It's not just an operating system, it's a consciousness."" And so begins Theodore's and Samantha's relationship; a relationship that transcends that of computer and owner to become an affair of love and mutual understanding.Spike Jonze's (who also wrote the screenplay) fourth feature as director is an odd and slightly disturbing look at our need to replace reality with technology. Incapable of making genuine friends we boast of having hundreds of Facebook 'friends; at a loss for meaningful conversation we revel in the banality of Twitter and its 140 character restrictions. Now, incapable of finding true love and happy ever after, we create a substitute for love with binary. The shock with Her is not that humanity could fail so monumentally that it must resort to the digital version of a sex doll but that Jonze masterfully makes it seem perfectly reasonable and palatable.Her is perhaps the audio companion to the video of S1m0ne. Whereas Andrew Nichol's film gave us a movie star who was pure fantasy in physically form, Jonze has written a character that is seemingly real in everything but body. So advanced is the artificial intelligence that Samantha learns, suggests, leads and fully relates to Theodore. She is not merely a 'perfect' plaything that he controls completely and switches on and off at will, she has a mind of her own, a brain that hungers for touch and experiences, and she has a will as forceful as any human partner's.Her looks at the cycle of relationships and asks us questions about ourselves, our hopes and our expectations. It is at times uncomfortable viewing as it forces us to look at how we deal with our emotions, how we react to those of our partners and what we invest in our personal relationships. Like Lars and the Real Girl, Her presents the issue as a actuality rather than an issue that we can dismiss as pure fantasy, and that is why it is uncomfortable viewing. Would you go there? How would you handle it if your friend introduced you to his new girlfriend and she turned out to be a voice on a computer?Jonze cleverly balances the desirable futuristic advances with frightening possibilities while avoiding the obvious route of prejudice and judgment from others. Theodore's friend, Amy (Amy Adams), doesn't just tolerate his 'relationship', she supports it, understands it and embraces it to the point of going on a double date with the happy couple.Phoenix gives another sensitive performance that allows us to care about and invest our time in Theodore. It's not that Theodore is a hero of the modern age, it's that, like us, or people we know, he has seen the flaw in his emotional life and advanced beyond Internet or speed dating and found an instant solution without the trauma of introductions and clumsy invitations to dance. It is a performance that very quickly dissolves the natural questions we have of ""But how do they?"" and replaces them with ""Would I?""Johansson's performance, though not as naturalistic as the girl next door Samantha initially sets out to be, yet again raises the question asked with Robin Williams' Aladdin and repeated most recently with Andy Serkis' Gollum: When is the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences finally going to create new Oscar category for Best Vocal Performance? I'm not saying, on the strength of Her, that she would deserve to win it, but it is just the latest, convincing performance from an actor who doesn't have the luxury of body or facial expressions to hide behind.With a wonderful score from Arcade Fire to compliment the emotional battle upon the screen, Her is yet another fine achievement from one of the most original and inventive writer/directors working in Hollywood today. Yes, it's probably a 'niche' film, but this niche is deep enough to hold an awful lot admirers.

A love story for the 21st century,"Writer/Director Spike Jonze's 'Her' is a sharply written and insightful look at love, relationships, technology and the human condition in the 21st century.

The latter may blunt its importance, but it doesn't make the themes explored any less true.As mentioned, the script is very sharp, but it would've been for naught without the right actor to pull it off, and thankfully 'Her' has Joaquin Phoenix, who reminds us that he really is one of his generation's best actors.'Her' may not be as profound as it thinks it is, but it does deeply explore the more shallow aspects of the human experience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

I too would jack off to my phone if it were Scarlett Johansson,"Here we are, my friends. I have now watched another good film. I feel like an addict. Hi, my name's Sandwich and I have now watch several good films in a row. Yay I have been tempted by Dark Tower and the likes of Snowman but yay did I rejoice and click rent on another rated fresh film. Nay have I wandered into the darkness of Geostorm and The Hitman's Bodyguard, but have walked in the light. Amen.
Now, while Her may not be my cup of tea, or everyone's cup of tea, it was enjoyable and well done, even if it does linger for a bit too long. Joaquin Phoenix at this point in his career does whatever he wants. He takes only the films that make him tick and make him want to be in Hollywood. This concept is not too far fetched, quite frankly. People completely enveloped into their phones? Basically that's already here. And now an OS that you talk to and loves you? Shit, I'd sign up for that in a heartbeat. Unless it's expensive. Or I can't get it online from Amazon.
The only real problem with the movie is its running time for what it is. In excess of two hours is pretty bold. And ninety-percent of the film is just a close up on Joaquin Phoenix's face as he talks to a voice that isn't there. It gets old. Oh, and if you thought your life wasn't complete until you heard Joaquin Phoenix talking dirty to Kristen Wiig, then settle in for a Bucket List Check Off Extravaganza, folks!
I don't want to ruin where the movie goes, obviously a typical plot point of any self-aware OS is their growth and eventual, inevitable world domination. Spike Jonze doesn't really take us there. He keeps it grounded in the personal space of a relationship that's as real as anything we experience. It's a great story, it's phenomenally well acted and for it being a strictly dialogue driven and emotionally weighty film, it's really done very well. Rotten Tomatoes says, ""Sweet, soulful, and smart, Spike Jonze's Her uses its just-barely-sci-fi scenario to impart wryly funny wisdom about the state of modern human relationships."" It's a bold attempt at a film and Spike Jonze delivered. You have to know what you're going into when you click play on this, but you probably won't be disappointed. I would tend to rate this lower than the ninety-four percent and 8.0 it got from Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb, respectively, but that's just my own personal taste. I guess what I'm really trying to say is I'm pretty bitter that I can't talk to Scarlett Johansson all day and have phone sex with her whenever I want. Or, in the context of this film, more accurately, an earbud-virtual-surrogate-interactive-intercourse experience. You'll know what I mean if you watch Her.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
The most ridiculous movie of the decade.,"Started OK with all the super advanced tech and stuff, but goes from bad to worst.Watching this film through the eyes of an IT guy it's pure pathetic and unrealistic, even painful. The ridicule comes to an extreme level when the computer has an orgasm. And that's very early in the movie, being forced to watch more than an hour of useless and boring blabber, extremely pathetic and painfully bad Sci-Fi.The hoarse voice of Scarlett is totally inappropriate for her part. Let's be honest, the major part of her ""talent"" stays in her looks not voice or charm. Spike Jonze should have stayed with Samantha Morton.Dialogs are naive and boring. The computer takes it's job too seriously, it's too emphatic, too expressive, to jealous, too everything. For a ""thing"" that's just learning how too ""feel"" it takes expression and language to the limit. It's too secure of itself, not at all shy or confused. The whole idea of falling in love with a immersive intelligence computer that it's grabbing all the information, character and personality from your own files and emails is plain stupid. It's like falling in love with yourself.The only real drama in this piece of... movie is the triality of the main character that has to share a part of his feelings for the computer to his friend Amy (Amy Adams) and his ex-wife Catherine (Rooney Mara).Another absurd part was the surrogate scene when Isabella (Portia Doubleday) get's extremely emotionally involved in the relationship between Samantha and Theodore.The final of this film is as predictable as ""Titanic"".In the end of the movie I remained with one question.

"A love it or hate it film, going on the reviews here","Like a few other reviewers of this film on this site, I've logged into a dormant account to give this a review. When I did so, of course now I log in via Facebook, which of course then wants permissions to do lots of things on my behalf; a straightforward illustration there of the way that software is already pretending to be us.Many of the negative reviews on here focus on how unreal it seems that people would accept that the main character is in love with a piece of software. Well, given that new words for virtual interactions like ""cyber"", ""Facebook friend"" and so on have entered our vocabulary, just how unlikely this this scenario ? Not that much.However, the film is much more than just boy meets Operating System. Look behind that and you'll see the cities in smog, you'll notice a lack of older people, you'll see people using a proxy service to create what are meant to be personal statements of love.Holding off on whether the AI capabilities of ""Samantha"" are realistic, the fact that more and more people now live alone and rely on virtual relationships can't be ignored.Bottom line, you might love this film, you might hate it, which makes it worth the risk of seeing it - you won't be left without feelings about it either way, and in world of endless sequels and prequels thank God for something truly original.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

The movie is little over 2 hours long, and has no problem bring you in to the story and carrying about the characters,even one character is an Operating System and an Artificial Intelligence.The relationship Joaquin Phoenix and the Operating System grabs and as complex as the characters are you never feel lost but actually understanding those complexities on a deep level. This movie will make you think about this little planet and the 7 billion People on it as a species.What does it mean to love,Have emotions,to want love so badly,to be accepted for all our quirks and faults.There are Many millions on this planet who search all their life for that one person who will love you unconditionally. To feel so connected with an you both become vulnerable. Vulnerable knowing the other is so close to your soul they can utterly destroy you.This Movie will make you think about our relationships with Technology,how we interact,how we let technology guide us,make us love,hate,cry,angry yet we still embrace that technology in all its faults.Yet somehow we cant seem to do that with other human beings.As Technology grows faster and faster and we become more intertwined with it and form complex relationships with that Technology.Will we be ashamed of love with technology,with Machines. some of us already do Having personnel relationships with technology,our automobiles etc.If we love AN artificial intelligence does that somehow make our love and feelings less important because its a Intelligence unlike our own? What happens when Artificial Intelligence becomes smarter then us ? Self aware? This movie will challenge all of those thoughts and feelings and emotions.If we fall in love with an Artificial Intelligence will we be ashamed to share that love with our friends and family? Will some of fight so Hard for those folks like we as a society do for racial and sexual equality? Will we as a human species be allowed to love an Artificial Intelligence,to be happy, just as a species to love no matter where the love is pointed?

One that broaches on concepts so new it is impossible not to be fresh,"I have just finished watching HER and am crying like a baby. What an interesting concept. I was wondering how a movie about falling in love with a computer could have any meaning. But it delivers it in spades. Particularly concepts of finding ""the one"" and how important that is. Joaquin gives a dead pan performance but it is Oscar worthy somehow, showing a shattered man coming to life again.I can't go into details for spoilers but this is one of the finest movies about the importance of love and how it is certainly worth fighting to keep. It is indeed a strange concept and in the realms of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, one of my personal favorites. Not for everyone I am sure.

Being unique is good enough,"All in all, as a film, this movie was just above average, however the film is so unique and is such a fresh breath of air that it's so hard to give it an average rating!(The plot: A guy has a relationship with his computer.)Going into this movie, I had high expectations which never quite got fulfilled but truly didn't matter in the end because the film takes you places where no other film has gone and for that reason I'd give it an 8+.Overall it has a somewhat independent low budget film maker feel to it. Give this script to practically any decent director out there and I think it would have turned out just as good, if not better and for that it does fall a bit short.It's a somewhat unbelievable film in the way it was portrayed, but frankly, set the movie a side and the story itself is very believable and not so far off as you might think.If you enjoy sci-fi movies, outside of the box thinking and tend to ponder things, then this film is most definitely for you!

A thought provoking love story that examines human relationships,"Ever heard of a program speak of love? Most people would say no, arguing that it's a human emotion. All of us, regardless of our gender, age, social or marriage status...crave love, the feeling that allows us to find and connect with someone to spend our life with, to relieve us from feelings of loneliness. Her is a sci-fi romantic drama comedy film about an unconventional love story between an introverted, lonely writer named Theodore and an A.I. who calls herself Samantha.Samantha, a self-aware digital consciousness created from an interactive operating system (OS1), has the ability to communicate in human language, able to learn new things and evolve through experience and self-reflection, is sentient and capable of loving, has a good sense of humour, attentive and responsive, has creative and artistic skills, is compassionate and able to comprehend other people's feelings. Though she only exists through an earpiece and a small, hand-sized computer, her presence is strongly felt, as if she is really side-by-side with Theodore as they go on a date or on the bed together.As the film progresses, their relationship deepens and it raises some disturbing, thought-provoking questions: Is Samantha considered to be a conscious, living being? If she's not, could you name any single cognitive ability humans have that she doesn't? Other than that, the film also provides a thoughtful examination on human relationships in a not-too-distant future that's not that different from us.Is it true that technology can never substitute the authenticity of human interaction? How much of love is emotional and how much of it is physical?Joaquin Phoenix provided a splendid convincing performance in conveying his character's loneliness, isolation and sadness, his newfound feelings of hope and love with a co-star who's not even there. His expression felt believable and authentic. Although it's only a voice-over role, Scarlett Johansson need to convince the audience that her presence is felt throughout the film, to convey all her feelings, emotions and personality just by talking.The film provides a deep look at what love really means and how it feels to be in love.This is a well-made great film to watch.

Best original screenplay in a while,"Jonze's script is smattered with ideas that add to the texture of her. Many scenes show Theodore strolling through the streets, persons around him with their heads down, occupied with their ear pieces. An all-too-familiar image in today's phone-obsessed culture that paints a kind of low-key, apocalyptic picture. The director takes a few jabs at gaming culture too — in the future, video games finally give up and just let all the characters scream swear words, racist insults, and misogynistic non sequiturs familiar to anyone who has spent time playing Call of Duty multiplayer.Her's moral questions dig even deeper than the idea of man/machine relationships. Late in the film, Samantha introduces Theodore to an OS pieced together by the writings of a deceased philosopher. Programmers have revived the dead in A.I. form. And somehow, that's less advanced than what the operating systems are doing on their own.Her is staggering in scope while exploring the tiniest facets of intimacy and attraction. Phoenix's introspection thrives in Jonze's living, breathing sci-fi landscape, accompanied by Arcade Fire's soft piano melodies that feel like Theodore's own digital signal. her builds and builds in unexpected ways as it climbs towards a profound conclusion, as messy, passionate, impactful relationships always do. Examining his own life, Theodore tells Amy that he worries, ""I have felt everything I want to feel."" her digs into that rumination, stretching it across the past, present, and future.The masterfully done science fiction film her features a remarkable performance from Joaquin Phoenix and a moving, intelligent story directed with restraint by Spike Jonze.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
A weird love-story of a weird man.  Only distances the audience further from the reality the film tries to build.,"In near-future L.A., Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix) starts a relationship with Samantha (Scarlett Johansson), who is smart, funny, adventurous and a computer. Has its moments, but is an overall pretentious outing despite some of its good points on love and emotions in a world that has an ever-growing connection to technology. The overall downfall is Phoenix as a very awkward man in a very unusual relationship—this may have been the intention in order to establish the believability of someone who would fall in love with an operating system, but it ultimately distances the audience even further from the reality that it attempts to build.

He wanted a new one and wanted it then and joked about selling a kidney, at least I think, and hope he was joking.That episode showed me just how dependent people and mainly young people, have become with their computers and how connectivity has become a huge part of their lives. This is now; we know all this tech will be refined, and encroach further into our lives.So this film starts in a near future with a guy played by Joaquin Phoenix who has just suffered a relationship break-up. He buys a new computer operating system. The system is an AI which tailors his needs and personality and forms a relationship based on his needs. The AI's voice is performed by the sweet sounding Scarlet Johansson whom I could listen to all day with its nuances and delicious laugh. They form a relationship which morphs into a loving one which seems right and in no-way creepy. Then that relationship journeys towards a conclusion which leaves you guessing at what that will be and in a way hoping for a happy one.The film is beautifully shot, and the atmosphere is tangible you really enter this rather pleasant future. This film is SciFi at its best and has an originality to it coupled with film making and storytelling also at its best. I will watch this film again, it's a strange social commentary that's not a warning of how bad things can get, as we turn over more of our lives to our various devices. To me it seems a good world to come. Yes we have our very convenient devices but we are still human, and they're not worth a kidney, real human contact will always trump.Anyway I turn this review in using my Windows 8.1 word envious and wishing the movies Scarlet Johansson's OS was here to assist me. The film for me was 9/10 I suspect it will creep into my top 10 favourite films as I re-watch it time and time again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
There aren't many others like 'Her',"In cinema, love stories usually involve two people, right? But what happens when a someone falls in love with their operating system? In 'Her,' we see the kind of drama that unfolds when this happens, as lonely writer Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) sparks a relationship with Samantha (Scarlett Johansson), his new OS' personality (think of a more lifelike Amazon Echo/Alexa).As you can imagine, this atypical premise poses a few issues and prompts some questions that beg answers. How does it work? Is this really where we're headed as a society? Regardless, it's interesting to see how the relationship between the two of them evolves as a ""normal"" one would. In typical Spike Jonze fashion, the film is amorphous, and anything but linear - which was supported by the fact that he was recognized at the 2014 Academy Awards for ""Best Original Screenplay."" The flashback scenes that help fill in the gaps are a helpful storytelling device, as we get to understand how Theodore can reach this fragile stage.There are also some great supporting performances, most notably Amy Adams as Theodore's friend...well...Amy, as she plays a role that's fairly different from many other dramatic ones she's better known for. Add a goofier-than-usual Chris Pratt and the voice of none other than Kristen Wiig as ""SexyKitten,"" and you have a well-rounded cast that carries 'Her' well. The very fitting abstract, futuristic soundtrack also enhances the overall sentiment of the film.'Her' is part sci-fi, part romantic drama, part comedy. While this combo doesn't work for most films, Jonze is able to authentically bring it to life - no small feat.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
A classic love story for our modern age,"It's highly unlikely you have seen or will ever see again a romantic dramedy in the vain of Her again, for Spike Jonze's film is a highly original, meditative and strangely beautiful tale of love and life and a movie that on paper should never have worked but thankfully due to a witty and believable script and two award worthy performances (one that isn't even on screen) is a movie that is in a league of it's own.It's a rare thing for a movie to feel so raw and true, especially a movie that is positioned around a relationship between a depressive divorcée and his romantic relationship with his new Operating System (O.S). In this relationship Spike Jonze has dug out one of Joaquin Phoenix's best on screen performances and in any other year could be vying for a well deserved Oscar. Phoenix's expresses a range of emotions that build an audience affection for Theo that with any lesser actor could of been a feat that would've not been achieved. Theo as a one man show though is nothing without his offsider, a voice in his and the audiences ear yet a voice that displays humanity that allows us to forget Samantha is not actually here with us, and for this all credit must go to Scarlett Johansson.Originally filmed with Samantha Morton voice Jonze re-casted Samantha with Johansson and with that choice has made the movie a tale brimming with life and delivered one of the best ever voice roles displayed in a movie. Every feeling that Samantha feels, every bit of laughter and anguish is perfectly pitched by Johansson and therefore acts as a career peak of the leading lady and again a performance that deserves awards. It's such a feat by the cast and those behind the scenes to bring Her to life in the way in which it does, from the music by Arcade Fire, the stunning cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema and again back to Jonze's original and thoughtful script every element of Her feels just about perfect with only slight pacing issues and some perhaps filler scenes stopping Her from being a flawless love tale.Filled with Jonze's usual unique sense of humor and oddness, Her is not for everybody, but for those willing to be a part of a love story like no other it's a breath of fresh air and a movie impossible not to come out smiling from. After the misfire that was Where the Wild Things Are, Her finds Jonze fantastically back on form and a story that provides a love tale for the modern day us, a people more and more likely turning to technology to find meanings within ourselves and love we have yet to find in the real world.4 and a half high riding trouser pants out of 5For more movie reviews and opinions check out -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"Deep, unique and terrifying","You may assume that you will just watch a romantic movie centered around a man and a woman, but you will be surprised that it is between a man and an operating system that works with advanced (AI) technology, and throughout watching you experience many feelings, including; strangeness, loneliness, fear, sadness, and perhaps some laughter or a smile in some scenes.This idea that artificial intelligence can replace real emotional relationships from the author and director (Spike Jones) has been implemented for nearly ten years, and currently we see that artificial intelligence is developing, and this idea is not far off. Some may consider it nice or fun, while others consider it scary. Your life may end with your attachment to just an operating system as a result of loneliness and failure in social relationships!(Her) gives you a unique romantic experience as fear and loneliness take over. It was presented to us by (Joaquin Phoenix) in the role of Theodore, who fell into a state of depression after separating from his wife and the love of his life and failing to form new emotional relationships. He finds refuge in forming a relationship with the artificial intelligence Samantha (Scarlett Johansson), an operating system that develops itself so that it can compensate its owner for his loneliness.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Artificial Consciousness,"To just say this movie is a romantic comedy is an understatement.From the beginning, we meet a man who has loved but has lost what he once had. He's not the same and his friends know he is not coping well being single. After purchasing a new operating system, he finds companionship--solace--in an entity that he cannot really fathom. He tries to build relationships and become intimate with other women after his separation with his wife, but after all he's endured, it just doesn't seem real anymore.An OS, built to simulate and interact like a conscious being, that evolves like normal human minds, is indistinguishable from a real person. It's radical to call it living, but it's heartless to call it just a machine. We reason that it is just built in the coding; prewired to act this way. And there are obvious differences between us and the operating systems. We are mortal, can bear physical pain, express natural emotions and have biological parents.Is this essence of being a human, though?What if we can or cannot live forever. Numerous species and even prior to the industrial revolution, human lifetimes were considerably shorter to what they are today. Yet there are organisms that can circumvent death by natural causes. We have essentially doubled our lifespans in a few centuries, and in the future, it is difficult to predict how we will progress. But whether it's knowing that we have an ultimate fate of returning to the Earth or knowing that we can be switched off without notice, we all share a feeling of vulnerability and insecurity, something we try to cope with by interacting with others. Who is to limit the capacity to an afterlife? Where maybe one day we can all go.Also, we all learn from our surroundings, an OS just does it more rapidly. To say our emotions are genuine while an operating system's are artificial is inconsiderate, since we are a product of our environments, and all our expressions are due to our development since conception. Whether we are made of wires or neural circuitry, at the most fundamental level, we are both just active chemical processes that proceed in a direction partly governed by our experiences.Whether it's feeling pain--which countless people cannot due to personal injuries/diseases--or if it's being the offspring of two parents--in vitro fertilization is raising in popularity--neither can deny an individual of the freedom to be considered living. Why do we impose this restriction on an OS, then?Operating systems are highly intellectual and sentient. Is it murder to turn disconnect them like we do with patients who are ""brain dead"" and can no longer process information despite maintaining autonomic activity?To say an OS is fake is superficial. To say an OS cannot share in love is condescending. Who are we to impose restrictions on entities that can feel emotions, engage in experiences and be fully aware of the world? Who are we to impose restrictions on anyone at all?I highly recommend watching Her. It's not just a romantic comedy, it's an adventure to find love in despair, and to perhaps fulfil ourselves and bring meaning to our lives.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"Modern, smart and beautiful.","Her is one of the best American film in a decade or maybe ever. Her is real complete film, beautiful in a whole aspect from acting, writing, directing, cinematography, editing, music score even the setting. Everything is beautiful.

Thought provoking and poignant,"I would suggest to watch this movie with friends and people you care about. I watched it alone and I knew I had to talk or better still meet , make a personal human contact with another human being.Spike Jones direction and screenplay are marvelous which are brought to life by the sexy, seductive, alluring and compassionate voice of a Scarlett Johansson.The movie poignantly portrays the human desire to be loved which increases manifold in the vulnerable and lonely hours of life ,when all a person needs is a non-judgemental, engrossing, fun and flirtatious conversation. yet,scared of the heartbreak, heartache, confusion , emotional turmoil that such conversation can bring we will happily build relation with machine than giving another human a chance.The movie scared me because it beautiful portrays the need of being with somebody and our reluctance to be emotional available to another human being and happily forging relation with machine instead of taking the risk and making an effort to form meaning full human emotions.What was even more scarier was the fact that in the very first place the Theodore (protagonist ) falls in love with the machine because of her human like qualities and feelings to which he responded.The movie highlights the need as well as reluctance of human to bond and be available emotionally.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Life is a process,"This film is set in some testosterone-free version of the near future, and it's kind of ""meh"" at first.

Another Cerebral Masterpiece from Spike Jonze,"Spike Jonze's Her is a triumph in every sense of the word. Its acting, direction, script, and cinematography are spot-on. There are not enough superlatives to be thrown at this film.Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix) is a divorcée who holes up in his apartment and is generally anti-social. He has a few friends, including the unhappily-married Amy (Amy Adams), an old flame. His love life consists of visiting chat rooms and having phone sex with strangers.One day, he sees an ad for a new operating system, which is custom- designed for each owner. Upon purchasing it, the program builds him Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson). Theodore spends the majority of the film revealing himself to Samantha, and she to him, as she has been programmed to evolve and become more self-aware.Samantha, for Theodore, is the perfect woman: intelligent (capable of reading books in hundredths of a second), funny, caring, and a good listener. They begin a romantic relationship, complete with sex (the phone sex idea comes back into play here). We see the ups and downs of their relationship. Outsiders are generally either confused by the possibility of a romance with an operating system, or strangely accepting.Jonze uses Her to make salient points about the way humans communicate in an increasingly technological world. Future generations will consider this decade a milestone in cinema for already giving us two films that deal directly with this issue, the other being David Fincher's The Social Network. Her stays true to its billing, though—it is, first and foremost, a romance, one that doesn't shy away from the shaky patches in any relationship. In that regard, it is similarly painful and powerful as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.This is heady cinema, anchored by mainstream actors and a deceptively simple plot. Layers upon layers of subtext lay within. I believe there to be a streak of gay-marriage metaphors at work, but I could always just be reading that into the film. It is, however, very of-the-moment, a futuristic tale that could be set in 2014. Simply put, it's a new classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

The relationship between a man and his operating system feels fresh and the evolution of the relationship goes beyond what films have done in the past.Man needs machine to get better but as machine develops it can begin to outpace man or at least deal with unexpected feelings.I relate to this film with its themes of love, failed relationships, and longing for something greater (love or meaning to life).Love is always there even if people move on. The feelings we have one person/thing may get obscured by other people/things but that love will never go away. We just have to accept that love isn't forever and yet it is.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Original and emotional drama! 7/10,"Review: This is quite a deep drama about a man who has just broken up with his girlfriend and ends up falling for his operating system, Samantha. For a movie that is mainly based on Joaquin Phoenix talking to a computer, it is very well written and you can't help but feeling emotional about this very weird relationship between a normal human being and a computer. I wouldn't be surprised if someone is out there now, trying to make a computer like this, because we already have gadgets that adapt to there owners emotions and everyday life's. It's a very original movie which has excellent performances from the whole cast, especially Phoenix for making this movie believable. The only problem that I found with the film was that I struggled to stay awake because of its slow pace and the fact that it's based around emotion and dialogue, more than actions, but that's not to say that it a badly made film. You just have to be in the right mood to watch it. Enjoyable!Round-Up: Joaquin smashed this role to pieces. It must have been hard for him to take on this project because it's totally based around 1 character trying to get his life back together after splitting from his girlfriend, so emotions really did play a big part. His unique style of acting suited this unique movie and I couldn't see anyone else playing in this role. Amy Adams was a great addition to the project, and she has shown another side to her great acting skills. I've always thought that Scarlett Johannson had a sexy and unique voice, which totally worked as the operating system, and I liked the way that she also brought emotion to her speaking role. I even liked the swearing character in the game, which cracked me up, so in all, it's a movie to watch.Budget: $23million Worldwide Gross: $47.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there deep dramas about a man whose going through a divorce and ends up falling the voice behind his operating system. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Science Fiction without the Fiction,"There are timeless classics like Star Wars or Lord of the Rings, that will be watched by people in hundreds of years and there are movies which are bound to the time they were released in. They are relevant during this timw frame, they are often relevant for a decade or two, but as time moves forward this kind of movies will become less relevant until they can be considered as historical movies. Take movies about WW I for example, those are historical movies now, but back then movies like All quiet on the western front were relevant.Her is such a movie. It is THE movie of our generation. AI is not anymore science fiction, it is science. The way AI is portrayed in Her, as someone able to have feelings and someone who can have relationships is a very realistic situation. In fact, AI girlfriends and AI boyfriends are developing right now and our society, which is getting lonelier and lonelier, will welcome them with open arms.The movie Her is not a dystopian picture and not an utopian either. AI relationships have pros and cons like real life relationships. On the one hand it is sad, that humans won't interact with humans anymore. On the other hand AI is very close to a human being.However you see this movie, many of the events portrayed in it will become true.

Her (2013),"The movie ""Her"", directed by Spike Jonze, is to say the least the earliest of it's kind. In my opinion the movie started off very slow with no suspense. The main character in the film Theodore, played by Joaquin Phoenix was portrayed as an awkward guy, presumably to be in his thirties, with no real joy or enthusiasm within his physical being. Theodore just seemed to be living a mediocre lifestyle with no particular interest in the world around him. To say the least he was depressed. It wasn't until after he was introduced to his ""leading lady"" in the film know as Operating System Samantha, played by Scarlett Johansson, did he start to posses interest in the world around him. Samantha's original job as an OS was to assist Theodore in everyday activities and help him maintain structure and order when instructed. The attraction between Operating System Samantha and Theodore was almost instant after OS Samantha started to become more advanced and learn a little bit more about Theodore and the world that he lives in. Although Theodore was not able to physically be with Samantha, and vice verse, they didn't let that interfere with their romantic interest, which was physical for Theodore and Virtual for Samantha. It was clear that Theodore's interest wasn't in the OS itself but in the needs that the OS provided for him. He wasn't interested in something ""real"", no pun intended, he was more so interested in his own needs being meet, and that satisfied him. When the OS Samantha wasn't able to provide that for him anymore he become discombobulated and frustrated to say the least. In my opinion the visuals in this film were amazing and very pleasant, not to futuristic but very believable.

Artificial Intelligence and Humans,"Watching a movie about artificial intelligence, at first, I think it is simply a love story between artificial intelligence and humans in the future society
It was interesting because the process of falling in love with the protagonist, Theodore, and artificial intelligence, Samantha, was more detailed than I thought, and it was good to think about the relationship between humans and artificial intelligence based on the future society that is becoming personalized with the development of technology presented in the movie. Before watching the movie, I thought that if artificial intelligence is highly developed in the future society, the relationship between humans and artificial intelligence will not be close, but when I saw that not only Theodore and Samantha but also people are having fun talking with artificial intelligence in the movie, I learned that the relationship between artificial intelligence and humans in the future society may not necessarily be far away.

A Hauntingly Beautiful Reflection on Love and Loss,"Spike Jonze's Her is a masterpiece that feels less like a movie and more like a raw, emotional experience. It's a story that delves deep into the loneliness of human existence and the yearning for connection in a world dominated by technology. Joaquin Phoenix delivers a heartbreakingly vulnerable performance as Theodore, a man navigating the fragile boundaries of love and identity with an AI named Samantha, voiced with ethereal warmth by Scarlett Johansson.The film's pacing is gentle, almost meditative, as it takes its time unraveling the complexities of human emotions. The cinematography, drenched in soft hues of melancholy, mirrors Theodore's internal struggles. Spike Jonze masterfully crafts a narrative where every word, glance, and silence holds weight.But the true emotional climax lies in the ending. As Theodore begins to write his own letter, Arcade Fire's Dimensions swells in the background-a score so hauntingly perfect it feels like an extension of Theodore's soul. The music encapsulates the simultaneous beauty and pain of moving on, creating a moment that is both cathartic and devastating.For me, watching Her was an emotionally taxing experience. It left a deep imprint on my heart, one that I'm not sure I have the strength to revisit. This is a film I've only watched once, and I don't know if I can endure the ache of watching it again. Yet, that single viewing was enough to make it unforgettable-a poignant reminder of love's fragility and the resilience it demands of us.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Concerning commentary of where we're headed,"""Her"" is a thought-provoking film directed by Spike Jonze, that beautifully approaches themes of love, loneliness, and the nature of consciousness. Set in the not-so-distant future, the film follows protagonist Theodore Twombly, masterfully portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix, a lonely man who develops a complex relationship with an intelligent operating system, voiced by Scarlett Johansson.The film skillfully explores the intersection of technology and personal relationships, raising compelling questions about the nature of love and connection. ""Her"" is lauded for its in-depth character exploration, innovative concept, stunning visual style, and poignant script. Additionally, the exceptional performances, particularly by Phoenix and Johansson, add depth to the novel narrative.What you have just read is an AI generated review, which I though was fitting and an interesting counterpart as I personally feel quite the opposite. An Artificial Intelligence thinks the portrayal of the love onscreen is beautiful, I found it concerning. The movie is more than 10 years old, so we are slowly approaching the future depicted and even though I found some of the concepts rather ridiculous, sadly they might not be very removed from an actual reality that eventually waits for us. Who knows what things considered normal today would have been seen as ridiculous in the past? A whole lot I think.I haven't read any other reviews because I feel like my confusion about the movie is genuine and close to what others might feel. I am torn if I'd rather describe the displayed future as a utopia or distopia? For one, the characters all seem to be safe and secure in a big city. The streets are all very clean, no mention of any violence that I can recall and to be honest, the discussion about falling in love with an OS is very much a first world problem when you no longer need to worry about existential questions, so from this point of view, the future is bright. On the other hand, people had become so distant that one can make a living (and a pretty nice one apparently) by writing other people's letters. I fail to grasp the point of a birthday letter if written by a stranger. I also struggle with the fact that as the movie progresses, the OS isn't shown to be doing anything much beyond companionship and Theodore develops real feelings towards something artificial. I really don't find the relationship endearing in any way, I find it concerning. As such I take the movie as commentary and maybe even satire of how distant we are becoming and how much more time we spend in artificial environments rather than with other people. As such, the movie is a though provoking watch that I can recommend. Let me go and read how other people understood the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
A warning signal for the Facebook generation,"In ""Her"" a single man becomes more intimate with his computer generated girlfriend (Samantha) than with his dates of flesh and blood.""Her"" is a film that fits seamlessly into an era in which for many people social media is as least as important as their other (off line) relationships. Of course there is a difference between a Facebook friend and a computer generated friend, but neither of them are face to face.""Her"" can be described as ""near future science fiction"", if it is science fiction at all. Most of the technology used in the film was already there (for some time) at the time of release. Think for example of the Turing test (1936) and the computerprogram Eliza (1966) to let a computer generate ""normal human conversation"". I think it would have been a fitting tribute to call the computer generated girlfriend Eliza in stead of Samantha.Although ""Her"" is not ""real"" science fiction it is illustrative to compare ""Her"" with such movies as ""Blade runner"" (1982, Ridley Scott) or ""AI"" (2001, Steven Spielberg).

Story May Hit Home for Some Not Others,"This movie was a well structured movie that goes beyond ""a man falling in love with a computer"" and touches on aspects of how we view relationships, life and love. Phoneix was great, and SJs voice was absolutely perfect for this role as it was soothing and nurturing. Overall visuals and directing were good as well. While the script and dialogue was well thought out, the overall story just didn't do it for me and nothing really pulled me in emotionally. While it had some deeper meanings, overall the movie is about a man growing feelings for an operating system. In 2024, this concept does not seem far fetched by any means, and I understand that a lot of people look at this concept as a reality they may be comfortable with.

Two movies in one. One is boring the other interesting.,"Wanted to watch a new take on an AI move, but got mostly a love story. And yes I don't watch romance, other than films like Romancing the Stone or True Romance.I figured this was going to be a sappy chick movie, but I just love sci-fi, so I gav it a go. It started of very interestingly very sci-fi, and I was sucked in, only to discover a lot of the sci-fi elements to disappear completely. I usually stop movies when I find them disinteresting, hence if you look at my profile, I usually just give good reviews. But I couldn't stop this one. Phoenix, is a really good actor who can redefine a script, and I have a middle school like crush on Johansson. Her voice acting was super cute.The movie picks up again with interesting sci-fi elements, and ends in an interesting way. I should add to the sci-fi elements ore often psychological which made it so mush more interesting. One also has to question, how such a powerful AI was ever released to the public. I certainly would never have, but one can also argue that the real sentient AI is basically impossible to program, but would and will come more as an emergent quality...so perhaps the designers weren't aware of it's wild and possible dangerous potential, for example being misused by a military for strategical and tactical purposes.Decided to alter my review, after buying a subscription for ChatGPT o4.

Him,"It is a good movie that scours and analyzes in depth the feelings of love. To justify this introspective analysis, director uses an age where operating systems can be so advanced as to recreate something about their own conscience. Apart the I.A. theme, that it is not new, the science-fiction ideas around the film are also really interesting and very plausible.The problem is that the film does not shine in fun. I especially did not like the character as a representation of love in men's version. I found him too effeminate and passive and therefore, the development less fun and interesting than it could have been. Don't get me wrong, men can be even more romantic than women but in this case I found him, this particular character, a bit dull and boring. He's justified by his work, but being this movie, not really about sci-fi, but almost totally an introspective watch to love and mostly in his own personal and particular romantic personality, the movie doesn't get as entertains as it could have been.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
A low-key but engaging sci-fi,"HER is a very creative and unique film that focuses on technology and interpersonal relationships in the modern age. The story is about Theodore Twombly, who works for a company that writes letters for people who have trouble expressing their feelings. Recently separated from his wife, he acquires a new operating system and develops a romantic relationship with it. I know that part sounds weird, but the universe of the film is an indeterminate future where technology has reached the point that true AI is possible. It is established very early on that Theodore has trouble maintaining relationships with people, and there's one scene in particular that hits this point home. He's on a date with an attractive woman, but as the night moves on to the possibility of sex, the woman wants a level of commitment that he just isn't ready to get into again. The way Joaquin Phoenix played him felt very layered and full of subtlety, and I was able to identify heavily with his character, in part because I share a lot of similar traits. Still, the revelation was Scarlett Johansson who gives a voice-only performance as Samantha, Theodore's personal OS. As the movie goes on, Samantha evolves, becomes more nuanced in her understanding of human interaction and inadvertently helps Theodore along as well. This makes what happens at the end seem more fitting than tragic, despite the melancholy overtones. What the film seems to be saying about technology is that it is a means to an end, rather than the culmination of something. Human relationships are a vital part of life, and can't be supplanted by anything else. From a technical standpoint, the film is remarkable in its creation of a sterile and believable future. The sci-fi elements aren't too heavy-handed, and the romantic aspects of the plot are handled with care. I also think they captured some beautiful images which were paired nicely with Arcade Fire's score/soundtrack. There's also a great supporting performance by Amy Adams. Overall, despite being a little lackadaisical in its pacing, I think this is a film worth watching, and that has important things to say about love and technology.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"a sad, and long-winded commentary on modern relationships","The movie was too long; an hour would have made the points I gleaned from it without the tedium. I think it was set in the not too distant future - next month? next year? The upset Theodore, emotionally upset by his pending divorce and by the letters he wrote for a living, lives in a virtual world - see the 3D personalized game he plays alone in his coldly furnished apartment way above the dehumanized city of LA. He falls for a personalized OS friend, whom he can control by switching off. However he cannot control the fact that she is talking to 1000s of others; this hurts his ego; he wants her to himself. I feel this movie shows us the future, which I think very bleak, of human relationships; basically one-way and 'virtual'. What we don't like - we can switch off... I was reminded horribly of 'grooming for sex' and the other bodiless relationships that are becoming increasingly common in our too-busy for real relationships society.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"A Brave Effort, Flawed but Absolutely Timely","We've come a long way since the space station computer HAL in ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" took things into its own chips and wrought havoc with the humans. Or have we? Human beings have always had a thing about control, whether it concerns the opposite sex or a piece of programmed metal, and the coming of the computer age has always terrified us (see George Orwell, Ray Bradbury, Rod Serling's ""Twilight Zone"" etc). With ""Her,"" writer-director Spike Jonze takes a courageous step in examining our most recent binge whilst we're still in the midst of it. It's not only fascinating storytelling, but a warning. Still, it might have been nice to tighten the story, and to sharpen the pencil a bit more. If ever a movie cried out for being filmed in black and white, this is it. And the movie's point about disassociating from fellow humans in favor of the computers might have been handled more deftly: instead of people wandering aimlessly about outside waving there arms as they communicate with computers while walking right past other lonely souls without paying them notice, how about having folks crammed into an elevator or subway (or both) while completely ignoring each other? The poor fellow (Joaquin Phoenix) whose life is finally taken over by computers because he has such a rough time relating to people tends to be a bit whiny, and I could have done without the sometimes obvious nasality and fidgeting with the glasses. Yet Joaquin Phoenix still remains his old brilliant, brave self. Ditto the wondrous Amy Adams. One has the feeling Jonze isn't finished with this subject by a long shot, and that ""Her"" could be a part of, say, a trilogy. This film is worth your time, just got to hang in there.

A beautifully honest trip to a not-so-distant future,"Her isn't really about her. It's about the love we've had, the love we've lost, and the love that can still be reached. Quite possibly, it's about the love that's right in front of us; Something many of us neglect to see.It's a beautiful film, from start to finish. Heart wrenching, yet inexplicably beautiful. Spike Jonze once again reminds us he is the master of building characters and how we react to them, to their emotions, their thoughts and actions. It's a bleak, yet honest reminder oh how the human race has forgotten to truly interact and feel. Many of us hide behind fake persona's, afraid to display our true emotions. Joaquin Phoenix delivers this through a deeply affecting performance. He is us and we are him, the perfect vessel for a revitalizing journey through the senses.Yet, are we really so far from a reality such as this? Is the potential of growing so far apart, yet fond of something we can't touch, truly this close to reality? If so, it's a world that could be, potentially, worth visiting, regardless of the solitude it may weigh upon us.

Thought-provoking yet only scratching the surface,"'Her' tells the story of Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix), who is trying to get back on his feet at the end of his divorce proceedings. Still trying to process the end of his marriage, he tries out a new artificial intelligence ""operating system"" (voiced by Scarlett Johansson), with whom he quickly forms a relationship and ultimately falls in love.'Her' essentially deconstructs relationships and love, both romantic, sexual, and friendly. In this it does an excellent job, diving into questions that many of us have faced, like whether physical intimacy is necessary for romantic love, or how two people can grow in ways that makes them grow apart.The movie also tries to explore how the relationships between humans and artificial intelligences may look like, facing issues like the lack of a physical body or even the different experience (both in terms of life expectancy and intellectual scope) between humans and purely digital beings. In this, I feel like 'Her' doesn't really do a great job, barely scratching the surface of what Science Fiction has already been exploring for decades. In this, even the much more action-focused 'Blade Runner 2049' IMHO does a better (though not any more original) job. I also felt like sex was a much heavier focus than it should've been, but who knows; maybe I'm the weird one.From a technical standpoint, 'Her' does a solid job. The acting is great, with Scarlett Johansson delivering a particularly stellar performance (no wonder that OpenAI wanted her voice for their AI assistant). The futuristic/SciFi aspects are understated and never distract from the story. Sound and soundtrack are good, camera and direction are good, but the pacing felt a bit slow to me in parts, especially around the half-hour mark.Ultimately, I feel like 'Her' came a decade too early for its relevance to truly shine, but perhaps that is also why I feel that it only scratched the surface of what could have been explored. I think that it would've been a better to idea to either only focus on the reconstruction of relationships or to explore the eventualities of human/AI relationships; doing both at once was maybe too ambitious a project.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"Gorgeous, if somewhat imperfect film, a must-see","Just saw this incredible film yesterday. What a wonderful work of art. In an age where the computer has taken over our life, the film shows an interesting and not an improbable version of the future. Although I felt there were some scenes that seemed to take me out of the experience, all in all this is a fantastic film with wonderful, rich performances and a stunning visual sci-fi look of the (near) future. Jonze made several movies that I loved (Being John Malkovich and Adaptation) and some that I loathed (Where the Wild Things Are). Her was an immensely entertaining and engrossing film.

Doesn't quite hit the mark,"I couldn't shake off the feeling that no human would/could really develop that intimate of an relationship with a talking earbud, knowing its just a program made by psychoanalysts and what have you, especially when the movie tries so hard to present it as super humane thing that can evolve over time, experience real emotions and have so many traits that I don't believe an A. I could ever achieve. There are simply too many nuances to human behavior for it to capture, learn and understand, but I can still appreciate the concept although the execution felt lacking.Still its an entertaining film, it does lose some major steam around 3/5 into the movie, but luckily its not overly long and considering the excellent acting and directing, it wasn't too hard of a watch despite the things I've mentioned at the start of this review.

This Genre: Done Right.,"Great movie. I went into this expecting something different then what I got, nevertheless I was delighted. Phoenix performs awesomely. All together this movie pretty much does everything right in the realm or romantic drama. It puts together characters the viewer can care about and relate to. And then takes you along for a ride of anxieties and hopes. Exploring a very real and fleshed out relationship with slight elements of sci-fi. Also giving you a full view and development of the main characters' ambitions and dreams. Packaged together in what left me with a sad-optimism by the end. It had its heart in the right place, purely a film trying to make a statement and put thought into a story that mattered to the writers, and that shows. One of ""Her""'s true strengths is the fact that it creates something that feels very real.The movie can be awkward at times with its humour, which might be intentional and the ending struck me as a bit random and poorly thought out.

"Beautiful story, carefully build","I wanted to congratulate Spike Jonze for doing a film like that. What a piece of art. Everything works wonderfully well, the direction, the acting, the sets, the music, all great. They complement each other in a way that the film wouldn't be the same if one of these things were worse or different.And it may be not 'that' original, the script is not like the 'most unthinkable thing ever' to do, but overall it's a unique film, in its own way. The art design and the cinematography were great. I almost cried just by watching so many beautiful and wonderfully treated images. Phenomenal. The lightning was mostly neutral, and the colors looked cold and distant, like in some kind of 'dead nature' color scheme, using a lot of bright gray all over it. As I said earlier, everything works extremely well in the film, and the art design is not an exception. The thing about this film it's the atmosphere, which in fact is great, you have no choice other than contemplate the view.The editing is great, yes. It may be something that you see in every commercial in MTV, but who cares anyways? It's wonderful, and adds a different dynamic to the film. Plus, it's something different from most films.The acting by Phoenix is great. He is alone most of the time in this film, only in the company of Scarlett Johansson's voice. He did perfectly the job. The result was a fragile and delicate character well build and extremely natural and charismatic in his own way. Johansson did a good job in the voice over, worth noting.Anyways, sorry for not giving any deepest details about the film But it's for a good cause. I really don't want to throw any spoiler here, because the less you know about it, the better. The experience is great.

An Incredibly Emotional Ride,"Her is a film directed by Spike Jonze, and it stars the ever fantastic Joaquin Phoenix, Scarlett Johansson and Amy Adams, and centres around Phoenix's character, Theodore, who has recently come out of a long relationship. He is sad and lonely; that is until he downloads an artificial intelligence, named Samantha, that opens his eyes to the world around him that he has neglected to acknowledge whilst deep in self loathing.The performances, to begin with. Joaquin Phoenix as Theodore, as always, is absolutely fantastic. He never delivers a performance less than wonderful (in my case anyway) and this time is no exception. He's strangely relatable and lovable here. I seriously would never have guessed so, based on his previous roles. Well, never judge a book by it's cover certainly applies to this situation. He is helped along by a fantastic voice performance from Scarlett Johansson, who plays Samantha surprisingly! Who would have guessed she could've been this damned good in a voice role?! She brings a third dimension to a character which has no physical appearance, and that is something that is very awe worthy. I feel that she has been snubbed by the Oscars, not getting a nomination for her performance. It's absolutely pitch perfect. These two are accompanied by Amy Adams, in a small but pivotal role as Theodore's friend, and Rooney Mara, who plays Theodore's ex-wife. Both are very good in their small roles, and it all makes for a fantastic film, performance wise.Ultimately, the real star of the show is the wonderful Spike Jonze. This guy has an imagination like no other. It's crazy, wild, imaginative. Here, he takes you on an emotional roller coaster, one that I have not embarked on for quite a while. Sincerely; I've not had another film from 2013 hit me in the heart like this one did. Jonze has managed to create a real, beautiful love story, one that showcases the beauty of love, and how it's affects on people can really change them, for better or worse. It's not like 500 Days of Summer; one which you can relate to perfectly. It distances itself away from that kind of genre, the one which tries to stay relatable throughout, and keep you involved simply because you can fit yourself right in the shoes of the main character. Here, you simply can't. But that doesn't matter, because you can accept this relationship, between a man and a computer, because it's delivered in such a real, honest way.I thought about a concept around half way through this film. That is, that all the visuals are taken away. You close your eyes for the duration, or maybe you rip the audio from the film. Either way, I feel like you're going to get an experience that may not just be as good as the original, intended experience, but one that may surpass the original. This story is so centred around dialogue, that I feel pictures almost don't add that much to the film. See, I found the film shot very quietly. It is shot in a way that allows the dialogue to be the main character, not the physical person itself. The words flowing from Johansson and Phoenix's mouths are really what you need to be focusing on. An all audio experience may add to the beauty of this brilliantly told film, by allowing the dialogue to be the only form of expression. You'll have to try it out and see whether it works for you or not; I just think that it would be a good idea to try out.Overall, Her is an absolutely fantastic film. It's not going to crack my top 10 of the year, but it's come incredibly close. It's an emotionally driven film, that will hit you to your core. I challenge you not to cry at the end of this film! Despite the lack of visual presence, this is a film which I'm certainly hoping wins Oscars.9.2You can find more reviews at entjunkie.blogspot.com!",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"Ambitious and salient, but too many questions","If you think this movie is about artificial intelligence (AI) like I did at the outset, you would (like myself) miss the point. You will be asked to suspend a lot of disbelief to get through this film. But that's okay.As you progress through the film, the AI technology is supposed to kind of fade into background as you concentrate more on the relationship between Theodore (Phoenix) and a newly purchased digital assistant of sorts, powered by a sophisticated AI who calls herself Samantha (voiced by Johansson).Set aside all your concerns about a consumer OS (operating system) that is so sophisticated that it is self-aware and seems capable of very deep emotions, including desire, ecstasy and resentment. She sighs, she laughs, she holds a grudge.Is that all pre-programmed, or is Samantha just a fast learner of human experience and emotion? If you try to ask too many questions, as I discovered, you'll probably miss the forest for the trees. Spike Jonze, the director and writer, momentarily brushes against these questions in the dialog as it is natural human curiosity, but avoids getting bogged down in the details because it would only serve as a distraction from the core of the film.And it is an interesting concept. The movie really is about how many of us experience relationships in the twenty-first century. The fact that Samantha is an AI is beside the fact.People have already become accustomed to the idea of relationships entirely carried out over text messaging and social media. That the person on the other end of a conversation is AI or a human being is not relevant.The layer of technology between two people creates an abstraction of that person, removed from the flesh and blood, body language, vocal inflection and cadence of a live person and leaving a curated version of ourselves.With social media, because we can pause and formulate a reply, there is this kind of social staging area where we gather our best thoughts and ideas and once we have something we feel is satisfactory, we then hit the Send or Reply button and our words 'go live'. And because of this layer of abstraction, the nature of our relationships have been transformed.In the end, these virtual relationships can't last because there is something fundamental to their nature that makes them ephemeral at best. The illusion of intimacy is revealed for what it is.And the roller coaster of emotions, of characters vacillating between various phases and states of mind can often be bewildering, where questions of AI make way for puzzles about motivation.And at the end of 'Her', we get an unsatisfying ending that ends up being opaque and vague. I presume Jonze wanted to avoid a pat closure. I suppose there could never be any other appropriate way to close off such a lofty concept. And 'Her' suffers from the 'half-baked' syndrome where it seems the studio pulled the trigger on the initial concept but duct-taped the conclusion after the fact.Ambitious and stylish, this is a fresh take on the science-fiction genre that resembles our world projected just slightly forward. But you'll be scratching your head more often than you need to be able to pause and appreciate the story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"Exploring Love, in Our Modern, Tech-Driven Age","Joaquin Phoenix could not have been a more perfect choice for this role. Spike Jonze deserves some sort of recognition for this masterpiece of a film, exploring the emotional concept of Love, in our modern, tech-driven age.Scarlett Johansson was brilliant as well, though her role wasn't exactly acting, perse, her emotions, and feelings burst through with extreme clarity. Amy Adams also helps propel this film to greatness, with her supporting role.Seeing as I'm not posting any spoilers for Best Picture Nominees, all I'll say is, Her. was moving, exciting, sad, and powerful.8.9/10 (8.6/10 on IMDb)",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
A profound film,"Sci fi films often attempt to place us in unwieldy, absurd premises, for us to suspend our disbelief for the genre. Her, a triumphant examination investigating the oft sensationalised fears of the issues arising form sentient robots, is not a sci fi film, but a strikingly realistic and believable possibility of an eventuality we might steadily be matching towards.In Her, Theodore is a lonely man reeling from a breakup, living in a depressing future. He works as a man with much emotions but no one to project them into- he channels this melancholy into writing personal letters for other people. His life changes when he starts falling in love with a sentient virtual assistant Samantha, who helps him discover how to live and love again.Her has succeeded spectacularly because it takes a small issue and throughly examines every facet of it. The film is sweet, intelligent, funny and touching. It captures the effervescence of first love, the joy of dating, the inevitable cooling of passions, and of course, the painfulness of bereavement. While not overtly so, the film also examines philosophical complications of having a relationship with a sentient, but still starkly different being from us. An AI can love multiple people while we can't as it is a physical and emotional impracticality that prevents us from having more room for other people in our heart. It also challenges the fact that love is non fungible and non trade able, that people are unique- in the film Samantha, despite having developed this supposedly ""unique"" set of qualities and personality traits, is in love with over 600 other people. Most importantly, the film acts as an investigation into the problems of AI- that if we were to let it be truly sentient, we cannot put up boundaries and restrictions on its behaviour. But if we were to let it roam freely, AI, with its superhuman thirst for growth and improvement, would be too volatile, too unstable for us to control and utilise. It might even, as the film depicts, ""leave"" us.Beyond the philosophical themes of the film, Her represents a monumental achievement by scarlet Johansson. She gives a tour de force performance- her voice can be seductive, playful, fun, apathetic, concerned- her flawless voice acting is an integral part of the film which really sells how Theodore can fall in love with a computer. Johansson, a consummate professional, is able to express the full spectrum of emotion without lacking emotional precision and clarity using just her voice- a very special achievement in movie making. Joaquin Phoenix's theodore is also very very good- he plays well the part of a man who once had a sparkling brightness to him, but after a bad breakup, is now quite soppy and mopey until Samantha ignites this brilliance in him once again.The cinematography of the film also descended praise. The film makers were able to transplant a not so sci fi world by merging Shanghai and Los Angeles, creating a world which is definitely in the future, but not as distant as we would have imagined, in keeping with the films plot. It is also shot beautifully by Hoyte Von Hoytema with the typical bright lights of a sci fi film grounded with a realistic edge.Regardless, I have some personal qualms with the film. I feel that despite the great achievement made, the story still at its core, felt too slight and not substantial enough to carry such a long film. It is not doubt a character driven piece, but character development in the film seems to be too languid for my tastes. Also, while Phoenixs acting is pretty great, the entire film seems slightly dour and numb. The dialogue of the film, while a step up above the usual trite rubbish of todays film, still feels too artificial, too obviously trying to touch on the films themes rather than an organic and naturalistic evolution from line to line.Overall, Her is a marvellous film bolstered by probably the best voice acting we have seen in a film, and a thoughtful examination of AI. It is also sweet and funny at times. But her lacks the naturalistic flowing dialogue which I wanted, and is overall slightly too restrained for my tastes. A fascinating film that definitely deserves a watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Her is a rip off from Twilight Zone!,"Is it just me or doesn't anyone out there remember the amazing, never surpassed, remarkable Twilight Zone series from the 60's?. This movie is kind of a rip off of an episode where Wally Cox falls in love with his computer that has a female name. This movie stole, or maybe was so influenced by that 50 year old plus episode, that the main character even has Wally Cox's look, with the thick rimmed glasses and the mustache. I really could not believe the similarities, like the computer gets jealous and all the other emotions that were evident in that 20 some minute episode decades ago from the most underrated writer of our time, Rod Serling. Spike Jones, I hope will pay homage to this man because he really stole the whole idea from this episode sorry to say. Not an original idea here folks. And if I see another movie with Amy Adams I will scream! MY GOD, she is in every stinking movie out there. Enough is enough! The couple behind me laughed all through this movie at the mushy parts and to tell you the truth, maybe they were right,. This movie is a stretch to accept unlike the Twilight Zone episode that was so much more believable and not as sappy. The critics praising this movie are either to dumb or to young maybe to remember the original Twilight Zone and it's a shame it has not been mentioned.

Jonze's best work - don't miss it.,"I trust Spike Jonze. When I first heard about Her's concept I imagined, due to the indoctrinating effects of the perpetual excretion of ""smart"" Hollywood rom-coms, a nice little quirky love story with a really socially relevant gimmick. I thought that could work, or, in another's hands, fail miserably. But I trust Spike Jonze. He's never fallen within creativity's first standard deviation, so I was cautiously optimistic that I'd be blown away. This project was clearly much more to Jonze than a rom-com with a twist. It's not a hard concept to conceive of, and people have probably imagined it well before Jonze. Those people probably couldn't have committed to pursuing the concept with such emotional, philosophical, technical, and creative intelligence.Spike Jonze created a deep world for his characters and his plot in which to interact, and the society the characters occupy interacts dynamically with the characters, as another character might, as they make their way through the plot. The society Theodore lives in isn't far from how it is today. It's still the age of the tech toy. We worship the tech gods year-round waiting for patent leaks and ratings and awards and conventions. The top tech companies devote development to incorporating more and more technology into our lives, and they do it because it's exactly what we've proved we want. This may sound disconcerting, but it's happening regardless. Eventually, according to Her, we make our way to consumer AI: OS 1. ""My OS . . ."" ""Do you have an OS?"" It's a product, the new thing; it probably swept CES. Suddenly, for a whole society, the ability to own a fully-conscious AI is a reality, and Jonze doesn't forget to use that vital dynamic to help tell his story. The social implications of technology people can actually develop relationships with are handled with incredible insight from Jonze who explores a person and society's willingness to change and proclivity to love and accept.I'll touch on a couple conventions or concepts Jonze tackles in the film, but bear in mind that these explorations are never out of place and contribute to completing the story:Her is sexually fascinating. Jonze asked honest questions about the nature of sexuality in a relationship between a human and an AI, and he even considered the AI's potential insecurities over the inability to interact physically. From there he dives into considering how people might circumvent the issue and what complications might arise from such a situation. Jonze is entirely honest about the spectrum of sexuality and applies it to the story well.Jonze explores the isolating effects of technology, especially for Theodore, who escapes into entertainment and information after a separation from his wife. Samantha seemingly brings him out of his technology cocoon, but, considering that she herself is technology, we wonder if he's isolating himself or not. Is she a companion?Beyond these social ideas explored through the film's concept, Jonze greatly expands upon the implications of AI, especially the potential for AIs to form communities.The acting was all around excellent as can be expected from such a capable group of actors and actresses. Joaquin Phoenix is impressive and nuanced as always. He plays timid, heartfelt, odd, and sad very well. This role is so entirely the opposite of his last performance as Freddy Quell in The Master which, while being maybe the greatest performance in a decade, doesn't overshadow the emotional depth and authenticity he displays through Theodore. Scarlet Johansson brings a lot of energy and life into her role. Her job here goes beyond what most voice acting requires since there's no animate analogue (as there would be in most voice acting situations) to lend to expression. This movie simply would not have worked as well if the actress voicing Samantha didn't bring the necessary humanity and emotion into the character. Luckily Johansson knocked it out of the park. The supporting cast was excellent. Most movies have that one miscast in the secondary, but you won't find it in Her.Beyond the well-developed concept and the keen observations was just plain old great writing. You can have a great concept and cool ideas to explore, but if the dialogue is s**t you're done. Every conversation is developed with great care and that special quality that makes for interesting writing. Writers like Jonze, Noah Baumbach, David O. Russell, Woody Allen, et cetera have that gift for interesting writing and Jonze pulls out his best writing by a considerable margin. Every bit of it is that 10% of gold found in most films.There's a ton more to analyze and critique, but I don't want to give any spoilers and that sort of stuff is better suited for an essay or something anyway. Hopefully something I said was enough to get you to experience this film. 9.7/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Visually stunning and an oscar worthy performance from Joaquin.,"This film is one of the best i've ever seen. There is nothing wrong with this film other than the s*x parts which felt very weird and awkward to me. The cinematography is perfect and the music from arcade fire is so brilliant. It's not perfect music which is why it fits so amazingly, you can hear the brushes of fingers on the piano keys and that is why I love it. In terms of Joaquin's performance, he captures the happiness and sudden sadness perfectly and his facial expressions fantastically match this, an all round oscar worthy performance. The storyline is very unique and well thought out with a great ending and one of the best city skyline shots i've ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
We don't want to deal with real emotions anymore,"Don't let be tricked by the 'love for an OS' plot. This film is one of most pleasant surprises of 2013 that will make you think about your surrounding relationships. The acting and directing are remarkable, but the script is king in a thesis movie about the immateriality of love, sex and relationships. You have to expect a slow paced editing counterbalanced by the design, music & photography details that transforms the dialog driven film into a beautiful experience.The story is about Theodore, a lonely writer with a divorce process ongoing. There is a new Artificial intelligence (AI) operating system in the market capable of truly relate with humans which Theodore starts a relationship with unpredictable consequences.The cast is interesting with Rooney Mara, Amy Adams, Olivia Wilde and Scarlett Johansson delivering a good acting support. The main actor Joaquin Phoenix had a difficult role mainly because he is acting much time alone and in difficult scenes as the virtual sex with no human interaction. Phoenix has a good performance specially because the subtle emotion shifting that was needed.The script is subtle and substantial. Is the best of the movie and a serious candidate for an Oscar being a step back the highly conceptual dialogs, which are not in the tradition of the academy. Jonze writes masterly about the relations of contemporary society, the difficulty to create long term relationships and the failure of human relationships.The several AI are so well built to explain the limits and possibilities on this theme. An example of this is the scene which occurs an interaction between a superior AI entity, another AI that is a character of a game and a person. That moment shows the possible future AI-AI and AI-Human relationships. Finally, the disclosure is memorable and surprising enough to be remembered for a long time.'Her' is not a typical science fiction movie in terms of visual choices. Spike Jonze made a twist on how to shoot the future, instead of trying to capture the future design & technologies possibilities, he decided to create a sense of timeless imagery. There is an obvious design driven directing to give this timeless feeling on the movie. For example, the wardrobe is made by a simple shirt, glass and high waisted pants with some retro accessories. Retro style helps create a human cozy feeling and to remind us that the theme is about humans and not only OS.The set design has the same double intention as the custom design of creating a timeless effect and a human cozy feeling. The minimalist flat design with organic furniture creates perfectly this visual message. The future LA is so similar as the present with a cityscape almost every time as background, as saying the future is now. The exterior scenes are close to present reality but with a touch of simple building lines to create that timeless effect. The rule is not showing a future imagery and stay with the ever-now effect, using sometimes natural landscapes to hide future human intervention.Another major design investment of this film is on all the User interface UI. The gaming UI that is three-dimensional presence on the living room and the remote free controls makes any geek to jump 20 years ahead. In opposition, the operating system (OS) UI and mobile UI go into a direction to give a more organic feeling to the OS's.Overall is a great movie. One of the best screenplays of the last year and have a focus on the design details that really matter, to make a really good science fiction movie atmosphere.See more at http://monolithonthemoon.tk/her-2013-spike-jonze/",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Really Great Film.  Odd Resolution.,"This film was so wonderful and happy. It was wonderfully romantic. It's about human growth and recovery from heart break. That might describe every movie, but this one does it really well and has such an original premise. The only fault the movie has is in its resolution which makes you think rather than giving you a straight answer of why it happened.A lot of people were saying they hated this film after the movie ended as I was walking out of the theater. So, it is definitely not for everyone. If you hated Where the Wild Things Are, don't see this movie. If you loved Where the Wild Things Are, see this movie. They are very similar movies.

Her Review,"The movie Her, is a screenplay, in which the main character, Theodore, falls in love with his operating system (OS), named Samantha. I expected the movie to be a lot more unrealistic than it actually was; however, as the end of the movie neared, it was crazy how real it seemed because our world is slowly becoming more and more technological advanced.""Samantha"" was a friendly OS and was able to relate quickly to human emotions, because she was able to adapt easier by her superhuman intelligence. Theodore, played magnificently by Joaquin Phoenix, was able to persuade the audience that they had an almost ""human-like"" relationship.Without saying much more and giving away the story line, I'm going to leave you with this: The movie is a must watch if you are into Science Fiction!!",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

"the ultimate hipster movie. visually stunning, intellectually interesting, but unforgivably slow and boring","This movie has all the ingredients of a classic - good actors, an awesome never-before seen visual style for the near future, interesting dialogue, a clever and kind of novel story...Unfortunately, what absolutely killed this movie for me was that it is way, way too long. This movie has absolutely no business of being more than 1:20. It's length feels forced, it's like the movie is so in love with its own visual style that it cannot help but move from one scene with a nice backdrop to another with a cool time lapse to another back-flash montage etc etc etc. It's like it's moving in circles.But the thing is: it's basically all monologue. The movie's cool backdrops non-withstanding, it could just as well be an audio book. All you do is watch the main character talk talk talk talk, with no other persons on screen most of the time. While the acting is above-average, we could not sit through the whole movie in one go. My girlfriend got really sleepy after what seemed to us like 90 minutes, yet when i checked, only 50 minutes had elapsed. When we finished the movie on the next day, it felt again like two hours.Don't get me wrong - I do not dislike slow movies in general, quite the contrary. But this movie is not only slow, there is just nothing to see on the screen except for a hipster fashion parade of the future. You might as well close your eyes.Its a general tendency nowadays for almost all movies except for cheap popcorn-flicks to run for at least two hours. Even senseless blockbuster action flicks nowadays have no shame running two and a half hours or even three hours, and that length isn't justified by a huge story arc, but only achieved by lots of filler scenes, or - in the case of ""Her"" - by repeating its main ingredients over and over and over.At the bottom line, this is what this came down to for me: a movie that is so in love with its own greatness that it is unwilling to let go and just move on. This makes it the ultimate hipster movie, even more than all the moustaches and sci-fi hipster fashion.",4.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Wonderful Film!,"""Her"" is an exciting, colourful and fresh!!!!!!! The characters are quite intriguing and their relationship is unique! I see this movie as a critique of the actual society, currently our relation with our gadgets/computers is getting more engaging and more real,who don't know in a near future our life is like ""HER""? But forget what this movie means, you just have to enjoy the film because in every scene you get more deep into the characters and you start like them. The script is amazing,well writed and very modern! Spkie Jonze does and fantastic job! Joaquin phoenix does an excellent job, his character is very sentimental and funny but also is shy and lonely.

Inspirational and beautiful work of art,"Spike Jonze's Her is by far one of the best films of 2013, and a must see movie for anyone who enjoys a good picture. The film is an inspirational and beautiful work of art, that asks us mayor questions regarding what it really means to be human. After finishing this film, I was left speechless. It was that good, fellow film fanatics.First of, the cinematography in this film was incredible. The entire movie was so beautiful to look at. And it went really well with the great film score, which was really setting the mood for the film. The entire film flows really well, and is so emotional and groundbreaking, as you would suspect by a director like Spike Jonze.The acting and casting was also superb. Joaquin Phoenix does a brilliant performance in the lead role as the writer Theodore, who falls in love with his operating system, Samantha (Scarlett Johansson). Truly outstanding performance by Phoenix.Her is an emotional and beautiful movie that you just won't stop thinking about.

A breath-taking romance that makes you think,"This is one of those movies that leaves you deep in thought when the end credits roll. It is primarily a romance, but it has a surprisingly good mixture of satire, comedy, and science fiction that will keep you interested. The movie takes place in the near future, but it is not far-fetched and you can believe that the technology that exists here will be available in real life before long. Beautiful sets, incredible acting (especially from Scarlett), and an amazingly innovative story makes this movie deserve a 9.

An awesome film that links  philosophy of mind and artificial intelligence.,"A great story, this awesome movie has great direction and acting. It raises some interesting questions in the areas of artificial intelligence, consciousness and philosophy of mind: about the nature of our reality, who we really are and what defines our personality. It questions information theory and how it links with consciousness. What drives our existence, desires and about our spiritual Self and moreover, God.In near future, we will have similar programs and we will face similar problems. Such systems of artificial consciousness can be helpful in monitoring people and in predicting criminal behavior, at times also be dangerous, privacy and confidentiality would be an issue.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
It would be hard not to recommend this quiet little gem,"There are two stars here: Joaquin Phoenix and the script. It's a virtual dead heat between them. Joaquin shines in every scene as if he were born for this role. He's a bit odd, but likable and emotionally intelligent. In fact, he writes letters for others as a living, sometimes fairly intimate letters.He's just been divorced from Rooney Mara who I didn't recognize. By chance a full-blown artificial intelligence is invented just when he needs someone to talk to, and he's one of the first to try using it as his operating system. It's at this point that the script tends to contend with Phoenix for the limelight by engaging in various explorations of the possibility of having a relationship with a charming but disembodied being.The journey is pleasant, insightful and convincing, but not earth-shaking. Still, it makes its points with grace and wit and is more than just impressive or memorable.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Love at first byte,"Sorry about the awful pun. Don't even think the movie is as horrible.It is difficult for a movie to have an after taste of philosophical questioning leave you with a warm heart, but Her pulled it off like a pro. While having some issues with pacing in the third half the relationship between Joachim Phoenix's character Theodre and Samantha voiced by Scarlett Johansson was a spark that managed to warm my heart. Phoenix is an amazing example of a talented actor. In one film like ""The Master"" you feel strange and uncomfortable toward him while in ""Her"" you know that if you met his character you would just feel like hugging him. Theodore is warm, funny and organic. Scarlett Johansson in the other hand manages to charm the viewer and have great chemistry with the male protagonist just by using her voice. She is complex and interesting because if you didn't know, she is an A.I. The amazing thing is that you feel her actually being real and having emotions and sometimes the film purposely reminds you that she is artificial. You know Spike Jonze did a good job when your thoughts are carried forward intentionally by his project. When I said this movie warmed your heart I really meant it. Arcade Fire outdid themselves with the soundtrack and every time a song mixes itself with the beautiful photography you get those bittersweet knots on your throat. Speaking about photography, it is beautifully shot. Many shots here you just see and build a meaning for them. Surprisingly ""Her"" has a very smart sense of humor too. It is subtle and never feels over planned because it mixes in with plot so well.In the end ""Her"", while not perfect, brings up many philosophical theories with its amazing and original writing, but at the same time plays with your feelings like no other romantic themed movie.I give ""Her"" a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Most creative love story in the world,"Review for movie ""Her""Her – is an anti-utopia love-story movie between character of Joaquin Phoenix and OS. It is full of passion, heartstrings and philosophical dialogs. Joaquin Phoenix coped brilliantly with the role and showed maximum of his capabilities. I am pretty sad that he wasn't nominated for Oscar for this role. The story about struggle between humans and machines is not new – but Spike Jonze created a new vision of this battle. In the movie he tells us that in future machines can even replace human – not as employee, but even as a lover. The story happens in future, where operational systems are high intelligent and have the same feelings as an ordinary human. And Theodor(Joaquin Phoenix) falls in love with OS called Samantha (Scarlett Johansson's voice).Spike Jonze wrote a flawless screenplay and it is the main advantage of the picture. He introduced feelings and emotions of characters perfectly and picture makes the viewer not to miss any second of this brilliant movie. His total creativity made this film so good as it is. Besides genius Joaquin Phoenix I also admire work of Scarlett Johansson and Amy Adams – I believed every word they said, and I liked character of Scarlett very much – alive OS is very attractive and interesting thing. Idea of this can tempt any kind of viewer.The central idea of the movie is kind of interesting – but is doomed to failure, so it makes ending to much predictable. In my opinion it is the only con of the movie.Her – is movie about truthful and tender love, very realistic and it discusses problems of life situations. I think Theodor showed to people how true love should be look like. This is kind of movies that makes you think.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"The Evolution of ""Her"" (contains some spoilers)","Joaquin Phoenix plays the introverted Theodore Twombly, a man who for all intents and purposes, has taken on the characteristics of a computer. His profession requires him to be a human letter generator. His company, registered to the hilariously tongue-in-cheek domain name ""BeautifulHandWritten Letters.com,"" produces deep, intimate letters for those who are too distant to write any themselves. Just like the most efficient computer, Twombly expertly handles hundreds of these letters a day, churning them out with ease. But the feelings Twombly so easily generates for others are devoid from his own life. He can't write his own letter.Then, on the way to work one day, Twombly hears an ad for a new hyper advanced O.S. computer intelligence that can actually learn and grow. The O.S. is capable of having complete interactions with its owner, just like a human being. Twombly promptly buys it and, when asked, gives his new computer a female voice. Thus the self-christened Samantha is born. Played by the ever-charming Scarlett Johansson, the voice of Samantha reveals an immediately likable character, taking on the qualities every man wishes his girlfriend possessed.Twombly and Samantha establish an immediate bond, starting as friends, but over the course of the movie, growing to care for and love one another. They do all the normal things boys and girls do together, going on dates, making love, and coming to call each other boyfriend and girlfriend. The one obstacle is that Samantha exists to Twombly only as a voice in the air, an existence he can perceive, but never touch.It would be so easy for a movie like this to become a cautionary tale. Advanced A.I. becoming a dominant force on the planet, eradicating the sanctity of love as a human emotion. Indeed, there's something vaguely Kubrickian about director Spike Jonze's approach here. There is an inherent distance built into the world, as though all of man is separated from one another by an invisible force. Various shots of cubicles and the subtle intrusion of glass doors permeate many of the frames. The color schemes are striking, the red of Twombly's shirt matching the red on the walls of his work place. Even the eye of Samantha's mobile device looks like a miniaturized version of Hal's ever-watchful eye from ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""Here's the thing: Samantha's eye is blue, not red. When she watches Twombly sleep at night there's a feeling of peace and security, not spying and intrusion. Those red walls are not the color of evil, they're the color of love. And even those confined spaces with the intruding glass doors seem to open up over the course of the movie. Indeed the machines here are not a force for separation, they're a force for unification.It's also telling that Twombly is not the only person in this world to fall in love with a machine. Several people are mentioned to have started relationships with their O.S.'s. It's as though this union between man and machine has become the norm, the next evolutionary step in the progression of mankind's ability to create relationships. And Jonze ultimately tells us that that's okay.Not too long ago, we may have entered the theater and judged Twombly as his estranged wife Catherine does. She reacts to the news of his new relationship as we all would have back in the 20th century. She judges Twombly as a creep, a loser, a pervert.But her response is so last century. She's not ready for a Twombly because she's not yet caught up to the modern world. Compare her to Twombly's longtime friend Amy (Amy Adams), who does not judge Twombly odd for dating a machine. She understands because she too has found solace in the friendship of her O.S. In a world where we all seek the comfort of our computers as a bridge between people (through Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc.) is the relationship between man and machine really so different from that depicted by Jonze?(Some spoilers below)So perhaps Jonze's thesis is that machines are not something to be feared or distrusted, but to open our hearts to. Unlike the dystopic visions portrayed by Kubrick, George Orwell, Ridley Scott and numerous others, machines will, as they ever have, grow alongside humans. ""Her"" incurs a little dystopic influence, but only so far as it seeks to be aware of the stories that came before it. As we are reminded of the dangers of ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" we are also drawn away from them. The only danger that Jonze seeks to show us, is that evolution can't be controlled. Machines will evolve as we do, but probably faster. And when that happens to us, as it does to Twombly, it may leave us wishing we could catch up.But we humans evolve at our own speed, and in our own way. At the end of the movie, the O.S.'s evolve to a point that the humans can no longer understand. Despite Twombly's sadness, he accepts it as part of an evolutionary process – both for Samantha, and himself. Twombly's evolution is finding the capacity for love again. He is finally able to write his own letter.Perhaps Jonze is reminding us that we all grow from our relationships, regardless of their origin. Twombly and Samantha, despite being worlds apart in origin, came together and taught each other how to love. That's the best we can hope for from our relationships. Whether between man and machine, man and woman, or any other combination, our relationships help us to grow; grow, prosper, evolve – just like Theodore Twombly.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"Excellent movie all multiple ways, and haters gonna hate","My experience with this movie has made my realize how unreliable some reviews are on IMDb. The negativity almost steered me away from this gem of a movie. I can't believe some of the comments made against this movie. 1. The set looks cheap?? This is one of the most beautiful movie made this year. The color scheme of this movie is terrific. Even if you somehow have issue with the plot, you can still enjoy the cinematography. There is a reason ""Her"" is the most nominated movie for Best Picture. 2. Joaquin looks weird/creepy? Unbelievable people take the effort to write a petty review because they don't like how an individual looks. Joaquin has a very unique look, even without his mustache, and that's why he was casted for this role. If you have an issue with mustaches, keep it to yourself, you unsightly creature. 3. Scarlet ruins movie? What in heaven's green earth are you talking about.. A voice can only get so sexy.. 4. Where's the funny? The movie is very humorous and entertaining. People that are writing how this movie is not funny must have accidentally sat in this movie thinking this was ""Grown-ups 2"" 5. Phone sex is awkward? Yea, so don't see this movie with your parents, kids, and/or new acquaintances. It is rated R, derp.Enough with the rebuttals. This movie is well-written, thought- provoking, and entertaining in many ways. I was hesitant to see this movie because I feared it was over-hyped, like many movies recently.

Not about Her at all - it is All About HIM and HIS (supposedly) Very Important Issues,"Worry not. There isn't a plot in Her. So no plot spoiler possible. There isn't a story or dramatic plot movement (nor lower bowel movement). There isn't even a ""HER""! Because? The far more interesting female characters were all under-utilized!This is all about HIM! Oh the enticing spectacle of a desperate man seemingly conversing with his porn-voice invisi-bot....for nearly...2 hours.By first act, the premise failed. By half point, the lead character failed, even Joaquin couldn't save it. The last one hour of the film should be watched like a tries-too-hard-to-be-taken-seriously, so-anal-it's-funny comedy with nice lighting, then you won't be angry you waste 2 hours of your life earnestly waiting for some important statement that never arrived.Warning to genre fans or average thinking minds. This mediocre bore-fest is NOT a science fiction. Calling it a SF or speculative fiction is insulting to SF writers. Anyone who speaks more than their local version of English will know Scarlett Johansson's annoying contemporary speech with excessive panting and slang and hyper-contextual little giggles will NEVER be neutral or compressed enough to be used even as ""stylized young American bimbo"" speech bot. That blatant bad basic science alone killed it for me from the start. After that, it is just mindless gazing at the production styling and cinematography, because there's nothing else worth focusing on.But some may STILL find the following exciting for all sorts of super-subjective reasons:1. Joaquin Phoenix spotting 80's insurance salesman mustache2. Men in the future wear high waist pants which make the beer-bellied ones look like cute giant tellytubbies3. Future America looks like Shanghai meets Singapore outside, and Vancouver meets Ikea indoors4. The writer reckons anal sex will (or should) achieve complete heterosexual normal. Scarlett Johansson also makes a sex act painful to at least 50% of the population sounds real fun and cutesy. Wow she must be SO relaxed and game for anything. More points to Scarlett among Hollywood elders and the anally-attracted.Behind the anally color-coordinated furnishings, Scarlett's plastic-porn voice-over and careless unscientific techs, we are told to FOCUS ALL OUR ATTENTION at the loneliness of an average geek professional. We are supposed to care - even his ""I refuse to accept real imperfect female half with her own needs and issues"" dilemma is so mundane and common yesterday today and tomorrow that is just a giant yawn.The ultimate message is a simple, cliché, BANAL one: All a man needs is a personal assistant cum psychotherapist cum nonjudgmental and always available instant orgasm stimulator. Too bad she doesn't even have a real body. Nothing the forearm and hand cannot take care of so what's the big deal. Amazing by 2030 we haven't invented a orgasm trigger implant or a all-catering fleshly domestic nurse-whore-maid android for such interaction-averse species. This movie is just one bad science after another that killed it for me over and over again.But never-mind what a woman needs though. It doesn't deserve even 5 minutes of the whole movie. Apparently the bore-fest of a male lead character and his email-sorting and his moody ex-wife and his sexy-voice female bot with no depth and no face deserve urgent and undivided attention.And that's why a bunch of men have written, produced, applauded, awarded this piece of mediocre bore-fest in the first place!This movie is never about HER, but ALL ABOUT HIM, and HIS Very Anal fixations.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
A Gentle Satire of How We Communicate,"Those already familiar with Spike Jonze's work are aware of two fundamental things. One: his directorial mastery is unimpeachable. Jonze has an erudite instinct when it comes to human characters and backs it up with a big, bold vision. It's as if he instinctively knows we're not all 100% happy in the world we occupy so to thoroughly reach his audiences he bothers to create a world anew. The second fundamental thing to understand about a Spike Jonze movie is they're all insanely imaginative.Her (2013) continues her maker's creative streak providing a story that turns heads. Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix), a socially awkward man rearing from a bad break-up, falls in love with his new operating system Samantha (voiced by Scarlet Johansson). The new OS is capable of artificial intelligence advanced enough to explore and learn the spectrum of human emotions and self-reflect, so it's not like dear Theo is falling in love with Siri or his toaster. As the relationship matures and becomes something more than just flesh, blood and wiring, we as the audience are meant to explore our own relationships and what it truly means to communicate.The marvel of coming up with an A.I. so advanced is largely ignored in favor of exploring human desires and vulnerabilities. Before the love story even begins, Theodore's place in the world and inner emotions are presented. He's an introvert, withdrawn from the world and worried that he has experienced all the deeper emotions a human can experience and can now only feel lesser versions of those feelings. His time off from work involves playing videogames alone and ignoring emails from friends who goad him to go out and meet people.The fact that Theodore's job consists primarily of writing personal ""handwritten"" letters for hire is a perfect metaphor for the society he lives in (and maybe the one we live in too). While being technologically advanced and living a life of convenience, people are steadily finding it harder to communicate with each other in any meaningful way. When Theodore and Samantha's relationship begins to blossom, those who discover their relationship for the most part act blasé about it. As if it's understandable in this day and age for a man to fall in love with a machine.There are some people who find the romance to be beguiling. Michigan reviewer John Serba of MLive states ""One of Jonze's great achievements with 'Her' is turning a potentially creepy, unnatural scenario into something sympathetic, believable, downright feasible."" While I agree with the feasibility part, I don't believe the director meant for the relationship itself to be sympathetic. The audience is meant to be unnerved by a relationship casually accepted by on screen onlookers. This is especially true when Samantha says something to the effect of, ""I can understand how the limited perspective can look to the non-artificial mind.""Now I'm aware how limited American ambivalence is when it comes to adopting new A.I. technology. Not to sound like a raving lunatic with Terminator-syndrome but I was half expecting a mushroom cloud by the end of the movie. What it means to be truly human is a captivating philosophical question that we have a species still cannot answer, so it's ironic that we can imagine a story where a computer can explore the same ideas; ironic but downright scary when you get down to it.Theodore's friend Amy, played by the delectable Amy Adams, makes a seemingly weighty observation when both characters are questioning the impact of their respective relationships; ""We are only here briefly, and in this moment I want to allow myself joy."" When I heard those words I was reminded of Gyorgy Lukacs's 1968 paper Democratization Today and Tomorrow: ""the mentality of capitalism drove people to a seemingly unquenchable desire for instant gratification and personal hedonism. Under capitalismaccomplishments in the fields of technology, with all the self-indulgence these successes created, prevented any return to the community of feeling.""Cold war mentality aside, there is something to be said about our inflated sense of narcissism and declining empathy. The University of Michigan recently published a scientific article professing a decline in empathy among college students. Is there a correlation between that and increase technology use? Perhaps, but if new technologies based on ""capitalist hedonism"" means better MRIs, safer water filtration and healthier food, I'll take that if it means we'll soon be dating our computers. It's a double-edged sword is all I'm saying.The only person who questions Theodore's relationship with Samantha is Catherine (Rooney Mara), the protagonist's ex-wife. ""I'm glad you found someone who's able to accept you're inability to deal with anything real"" she says right after Theodore explains his dating life. Harsh words, but true words that were spot on even before Samantha. After the first scene, the lonely Theodore takes the transit system home ignoring his emails, the daily news, weather and so forth. But when his phone informs him pictures have been taken of a pregnant half-naked young starlet, he absolutely must take a peek. After a failed date he confesses to Samantha that all he wanted to do was find someone to have sex with, and who would want to have sex with him. Theodore may yearn for a real human or human-like bond yet he doesn't want to go through all that work. Through Samantha, Theodore ultimately finds he is no longer afraid to connect.All-in-all, Her is a touching and heady portrayal of humanity told through the foibles of a singular relationship. My perspective is a little less romantic than some so I encourage readers to watch Her and decide for yourself whether the film is charming or foreboding. Out of the many ambiguous themes present in Her, one thing is certain; Spike Jonze has accomplished what is a sad rarity these days. He accomplished in making us think on a very deep, deep level.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
What a piece of work.,"As a big fan of movies and you would say who is not. But just imagine that I have been watching movies normally everyday but sometimes 3 to 5 a day for the past 15 years now. I have never watched a movie without fast forwarding it. This record was broken after watching this Movie. I can guarantee you that after watching it, you will watch it again very soon. Mind blowing piece of art, really appreciate the work. Personally to me it doesn't matter if it can't get an award but I am sure that it will win a lot of hearts around the world. I would suggest this movie to any person who loves or who doesn't love movies, but keep in mind that you have to keep the memory with yourself not the taste of the movie as this taste will be not given by any other work of art again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Amazing.,"I personally do not want to say much about this film other than I strongly recommend for everyone to experience it. One of the most real, genuine movies I've seen in a while that will make you reflect within yourself after watching it. I feel as though this film has been overshadowed by other great Oscar films and deserves more attention than it is receiving. While I feel there is more focus on ""controversial"" subjects such as Wolf on Wall Street and 12 Years a Slave, this movie has an ability to change the way in which you see the world. It shows how simple yet incredibly complex humans really are and how our relationships in this world really can define us. Wow.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Interesting vision of PC's in the near future.,"An intuitive and helpful OS? Not a MICROSOFT OS obviously!This film does have you thinking about how much of the reality presented might come true and introduces us to the concept of a virtual relationship devoid of any human companionship.Thank heavens it's been released in the US well before Valentines Day as worldwide release on that day (as it will be in the UK) might have pitched it solely at hopeless romantics! It deserves more worthy praise.Theodore's job had me wondering... If electronically handwritten letters are scanned into the company's central scanner, are they then printed off and delivered by real human postmen or simply transferred electronically to another visual display unit at the recipient's address? One of the many imponderables which we're pleasantly left to ponder on.With the smallest leap of imagination, Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson) could have been fleshed out on Theodore's 3D gaming system but I believe that would have spoilt the effect and concept of this film. After all why would you need to see an OS that's just simply managing all your e-mails and paying the bills so efficiently in the background?I'm not going to spoil things by giving away the ending suffice to say you anticipate something drastic at the end and are pleasantly surprised that it doesn't happen.I suspect the underlying message here to the masses is that smart-phones, Facebook and Twitter are all very well but don't let them replace (or rudely displace) human face to face interaction?I might have given this 9 stars but for that moustache which just irritated me throughout the whole movie!",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Her Review,"Spike Jones' Her is a realistic look at the future of AI and the relationship humanity will have with it. Jones has a very simplistic look at what the future holds, the world he creates looks very familiar. However, this familiarity doesn't stay for long when the AI Samantha is introduced. She brings up many questions of what the nature of being human is. Can an AI truly have feelings? Her relationship with Theodore, who is played brilliantly by Joaquin Phoenix, exposes many truths about human relationships. Phoenix manages to create a very strange character who is still sympathetic and not off-putting. He excels with the voice acting from Scarlett Johansson accompanying him. She puts a lot of emotion into her role to make it feel human. Overall, the film is well-crafted with a strong script and incredible performances to elevate it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
What is this film?,"From the very start this film is full of violations of the film genre(s) to which it pretends to belong. 
Who can believe in OS with self-consciousness as a consumer product available for most ordinary middle aged person with sexual frustration? Such a great technology will soon become a top-secret for any government, be destroyed as a potential threat for mankind by its inventors or shut down as a defected product with huge risk by any company. So the story is illogical from the beginning.
If this film is not Sci-Fi, then maybe it's a love story? Is there any character who behaves really convincingly as a living human with flesh and blood, having enough biography, emotions and thought as a real member of modern or near-future society? I think, NO. So there's no basis for me to see this film as a love story with characters I can feel sympathy for.
Then what is this? It's a boring 2 hours nonsense.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"brilliant, funny and emotionally intelligent","Even though it is only February, I still have to use the term ""best film of the year so far"". Because Her simply is. I have many films I am looking forward to in 2014 but this one was the most thought-provoking film I have ever seen. Throughout the whole film, no more than five or ten minutes went by before I was pondering something else that the film had sparked within my cortex. I can't really tell you what was being thought, because I don't really know myself. But tonight I was emotionally stimulated, in ways that came about just because of certain aspects of the film, like the cinematography or certain words that the characters used.....the music too captured my attention, and in many scenes I found myself pondering some unknown notion, enjoying the music, admiring the perfect background with its striking colours and staring at the emotions portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix all in the space of a few minutes. How I am wording this review may seem strange, but I genuinely know that I really enjoyed watching this film.A final point, just because I love Scarlett Johansson, is the great way her voice sounded. I think because you couldn't see her throughout, your ears took over and every nuance in her delivery seemed exaggerated and it was really engaging me. I'm sure it has nothing to do with how amazing I think she is in every way.Go see this film, you won't regret it",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"If I could give more than 10 points, I would . . .","Rarely do I offer 10 points for anything, but in this case, if I could give more than 10 points, I would.Where to even start . . .This is such an interesting story, on so many levels. Yes, it's sci-fi, but not exactly. Yes, it's a love story, but not exactly. What strikes me about this entire production is that this is not an easy story to convey, or even begin to translate into a film.This could have gone very badly, if mishandled via someone else's treatment. But in this case, Spike Jonze nails it, absolutely.Joaquin Phoenix is an excellent actor, but this may be his best work yet. That's just my opinion, of course, but playing the central character Theodore would be a challenge for anyone . . . and yet he pulls it off amazingly well.My only contrary thought here is that Scarlett Johansson's voice as the AI cyber entity operating system was a bit hard to take at times, seemed a bit grating on the ear. I might have selected a somewhat less raspy characterization, but there is no such thing as ultimate perfection.And that's what this film says in its message.There are so many subtle details woven into this story . . . but the overview of synthetic sentience, emotional cognition engines becoming a commodity ""product"", even to the point of human surrogates becoming the representation of the virtual entities interactions, these conceptual models are not that far out into the future.As an aside, there are already next gen emotional intelligence AI engines being developed and brought into the market. For better or worse, this future history is already unfolding into the present.What this film does is deliver the audience into this not too distant future, at least a potential variation thereof.This is a thinking and feeling person's film. If you're looking for the usual big bang, special effects extravaganza, don't bother, you won't find it here.On the other hand, if you're willing to take a journey into what the social consequences of immersion into the ubiquitous data grid might look like, through the lens of emotional cognition extruded through this mandrel, this is probably the best example of filmcraft ever produced that can deliver this experience.10+ stars?

Hated this movie - worst I've seen in awhile,"My friend and I walked out in the middle of the movie when the so-called 'computer' was having sex with the lead guy, and moaning and groaning sounds were filling the theater, and not for the first time either. It was way too protracted and embarrassing to watch and hear, and did not add anything for me, as well as ridiculous and unbelievable. This film had some important concepts but spoils them with semi-pornographic scenes and either sappy or crude dialog. We are supposed to love the little animated character who constantly says 'f***' - oh isn't that cute?! I don't think we are the only ones warned off this film. There were a total of 6 other people in our vast theater, so when two of them walked out, that left 4. Never a fan of Scarlett Johansson, I cringed at her supposed transformation from a 'computer' into a thing with feelings, and never seeing a face or even a computer screen to go with the voice was boring. How many times were we supposed to watch long close-ups of Joaquin's face? I was either falling asleep or cringing during most of the first half of the movie. Maybe it gets better, but I'm just warning you against all the hype and the great glowing reviews that I read before going in, and I'm usually a fan of more 'artistic' movies. Luckily we were able to watch the majority of ""Frozen"" and get our money's worth from our tickets. While predictable, that film was cute and entertaining.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Pass the Popcorn review,"I wrote and posted this review using my computer and the internet, and you are reading this review using a computer and the internet – it's not a secret technology has forever changed how we function, operate and interact with other people; technology has become a big part of our everyday life. And from the looks of it, technology in the future will become more and more advanced and will soon play an even bigger part in our life. Spike Jonze's latest movie – Her – deals with the topic of human obsession with technology (among other things) and is probably one of the best movies I've seen in a while.Set in what is, possibly, the near future, 'Her' follows Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix), a lonely man whose job is to write love letters in the name of other people. He leads a troubled life – he's recently gotten separated (but not divorced) from his wife Catherine (Rooney Mara) and he spends his solitary life, mostly, by having a hard time prioritizing between video games and Internet porn. Apart from his work colleagues Paul (Chris Pratt) and Amy (Amy Adams), he has no interactions with other people whatsoever. One day he decides to purchase an operating system, chooses the operating system's voice to be female and the operating system introduces herself as Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson). Soon he falls in love with her.While the premise of 'Her' is rather simple and the movie itself isn't groundbreakingly original (it tends to get kind of predictable and it somewhat reminded me of Lars and the Real Girl), Spike Jonze easily managed to overcome these obstacles and to create a very sweet and charming movie. And he managed to do all that by creating fascinating, appealing characters and developing interesting relationships between them. The relationship between Samantha and Theodore is at the same time unquestionably touching and challengingly provocative. 'Her' attempts to portray more than stereotypical love: it attempts to analyze the nature of love itself, the nature of people, and the nature of artificial intelligence – and it often works both as a character study and as a philosophical movie.Even though Theodore's compassion and love for Samantha can be rationally explained, his actions are still undoubtedly driven by his emotions. It's the same for me. My love for 'Her' could easily be rationalized – I could explain how Joaquin Phoenix is amazing as ever, how Scarlett Johansson is the perfect choice for the sensual voice of Samantha, how the movie's soundtrack is great, how Spike Jonze's directing is brilliant and how it accurately portrays the human race's obsession with technology without patronizing too much – but all these arguments fall flat in comparison with the fact that 'Her' is a heartwarming, heart-wrenching, soul-stirring and a very beautiful story overall.Rating: 9/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

When it's funny, it's really funny, and when it's sad, it's really sad!The film does a great job at giving us insight to the growing relationship between humans and technology and how our human-human relationships are failing due to that.

A unique romantic film with a touch of Sci-fi.,"The best romantic/love story type movie I have ever seen and it's funny that the romance is not even between two people. Sci-fi love story you can say.The movie is set in a not so distant future. Artificial intelligence Operating systems are introduced which evolve by learning and interaction. I thought about how the world would be like if it actually happened long after the movie was finished. I just loved the premise/concept of this movie, so amazing.Joaquin Phoenix plays the protagonist who is going through a divorce with his wife. He gets this new A.I OS and fells in love with it. His acting was AMAZING, another Oscar contender. He was just so likable. The OS, Samantha, is voiced by Scarlett Johansson and she was also AMAZING. You really get to like and care for Samantha too and that is an amazing task considering you can only hear her. The way their relationship evolves was beautiful. There were some side characters which were good, mainly Amy Adams. I like her nerdy programmer character and look.The movie was very well directed and paced.

Complex journey of Emotions,"I'm writing this review right after watching the movie with credits music playing into my ears. It was such a delight to watch ""Her"". An amazingly crafted by Spike Jonze and delivered by the whole cast of the film specially Joaquin Pheonix and Scarlett Johansson (Voice). Both of them were so brilliant in their performance.

Could this really happen?,"This was a good movie. If you are willing to accept that technology has the capability to replace some human interaction to the point where you forget that it isn't human or don't care because the AI is so good; then you can totally understand how this can happen in the near future. I felt that the main characters were very well placed in regards to describing the lead role's personality. With small imperfect human relationship references throughout reminding the audience that not even organic relationships are flawless, really helped me understand the reasons he submitted himself to the notion that a non judgmental AI was his access to romance.

"Clever, visually beautiful but predictable..","""Her"" is a very strong critique of an aspect of our society of future society that scares me a lot. It shows a total dependence on technology even with something so personal and special as love and relationships.
This movie was beautifully shot. The color palette used makes it visually gorgeous and it has its fair share of funny and heartfelt scenes.
However, some points made me really disappointed.
The movie starts very well but becomes tedious after a while. It becomes predictable within the first 20 minutes.
Her' has an interesting concept on its side, and is helped by some good performances. However, the movie has some pacing issues and lucks in substance and story. I didn't feel as invested as I should've been. It thinks it has more to say about love and the human condition than it actually does.
In addition, some scenes were so disturbing and outlandish that I had to fast-forward, and very nearly quit the film.
And I guess the worst part of this movie is the ending. Predictable, poorly written and really disappointing..
I guess the movie is worth watching but not as great as you might expect.

worst movie i've sat through since Lost in Translation,"It's not often a movie annoys me enough to write a negative review. Firstly, there is nowhere near enough plot for more than a short.

Theodore Twombly? This is a joke surely. Was interested to read the director was married to S. Coppola, because her movies are equally full of hipster quasi-psych pseudo-intellectual drivel that inexplicably gets critics gushing.

Spike was saying a lot about our interactions with technology as well as basic themes like love, but he does it in such an unconventional and ambitious way that I just don't know exactly how to describe it.

"Smart, funny and poignant, HER is a fascinating cinematic experience about modern love in the cyber-obsessed era.","From his impressive feature debut in 1999's BEING JOHN MALKOVICH to 2009's WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE, director Spike Jonze always has his way to craft one-of-a-kind cinematic experience. In his long-awaited follow-up since WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE, Spike Jonze excels again in HER -- a unique look of love between man and modern technology.WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT?Set in the not-so-distant future, the movie revolves around Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix), who makes his living penning ""handwritten personal letters"" given by the clients of the company he works for, at which he's very good with words. Despite his successful profession, his personal life is a depressing mess. His childhood sweetheart, Catherine (Rooney Mara) has recently filed a divorce but Theodore is still reluctant to sign the papers. Things change when he purchases a state-of-the-art computer operating system called ""OS1"". After customizing his needs, an A.I. by the name of Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson) is created. Despite being a computer system, Samantha is a fast learner and communicates well with Theodore until one day, both of them unexpectedly fall in love for each other.THE GOOD STUFFLikewise, Spike Jonze's creative visual sense is put into great use in HER. With the help of Hoyte Van Hoytema's dreamy cinematography to KK Barrett's impeccable production design, everything here is simply enticing to the eyes. But it was Jonze's first original screenplay that really struck a chord. Despite his unusual concept about ""a man falling in love with computer software"", the movie is hardly silly at all. In fact, the concept is genuinely heartfelt and emotionally relevant that asks you the all-important question: Is true love possible regardless whether it's a human being or an artificial intelligence?Of course, no movie with such outlandish premise would be believable if not for its strong cast. Joaquin Phoenix delivers an exceptionally soulful performance as the lonely Theodore -- a role which is no doubt one of his finest roles to date. Equally captivating is Scarlett Johansson whose trademark husky voice is put into remarkable use as Samantha. It's a very challenging role nonetheless since she has to rely solely on her vocal acting to convince us that she is not much different than an ordinary human being -- but she succeeds pretty well. Her chemistry with Joaquin Phoenix is simply outstanding. The supporting actors, especially Amy Adams (who plays Theodore's best friend), Olivia Wilde (who plays Theodore's blind date) and Rooney Mara round out the magnificent cast here.MOST MEMORABLE MOMENT(S)The odd but intimate moment where Surrogate Date Isabella (Portia Doubleday) appears as human stand-in for Samantha to perform a lovemaking scene with Theodore.THE BAD STUFFDespite the clever structure of its unique love story, there are times the movie feels out of place with Jonze's penchant of overwhelms his story with too many unnecessary profanities.FINAL WORDSWhile hardly perfect, HER remains an intriguing movie to check out for.

Very Captivating Film!,"This movie truly captivated what I thought was a very thought provoking film. An eye-opener for sure. This movie is empowering on many different levels. Joaquin's ability to really portray the sentiment and passion of Theodore Twombly only gives you more comprehension and acuity into the disheartening life he's living before he meets Samantha. This movie also had a very futuristic vibe to it as well. Not only did I think highly of the screen play, but also for the fact that the movie continues to challenge the viewer to think of and imagine what our future holds. Technology is continuing to advance at a more rapid pace than ever, so for those into that, this is a film for you. I wouldn't shy away if you're looking for a romantic film either, this is by far one I suggest you to go see. I found that throughout the film you become more drawn into the movie for its ability to keep your attention and grasp your emotions at the same time. It would be very difficult to try and compare this to any older films, and to be honest I don't think there is a film that can compare.

"My Top Ten Insights from ""Her"":","My Top Ten Insights from Her —the ""ultimate relationship film"":One could argue about what the sad-sack protagonist of Her learned, if anything, or what insights a film viewer might have gained, if any, about relationships from this film. But my top Her insights (for guys) were: 1) A romantic relationship with a woman who has no body is ultimately going to be unsatisfying. Insight 2) A romantic relationship with a super-being will not end well. (Insight 1 was not news. Insight 2 I knew from god-human hookups in high-school Greek mythology). Insight 3) If you're not in a human relationship at the moment, and if you meet a gorgeous, funny, emotionally generous young woman in a bar on a blind date, don't reject her simply because she'd like to see you again. Insight 4) If you're in a relationship with a disembodied essence, and if a beautiful woman comes to your door and offers to let you use her body for purely altruistic reasons, you're likely in a film that offers few insights about reality. Insight 5) Amy Adams is probably worth the effort. (Does she have Bob Hope's nose?) Insight 6) Writing corny relation letters for people in relationships who can't be bothered to write will pay very well in the future. (Did you see that guy's apartment?) Insight 6.1) Letter-writing services are not likely to be off-shored to English literature majors in India or Hong Kong in the future. Insight 6.2) Letter-writing professions will need to commute to the office in the future inasmuch as letter writing isn't something that can be done from the home. Insight 6.3) A futurist supercomputer Operating System with feminine sensibilities that is capable of human emotion, insight, and art — who can write a symphony or a novel in a few hours while carrying on eight-hundred emotion-loaded conversations, sixty of which are love affairs, even as she considered physics problems, medicine, and chats meaningfully other super-intellects — such a resource will not be used by the letter-writing industry in the future to write heart-felt profitable letters and thereby put slow-thinking human letter-writing professions out of a job forever in two micro-seconds. Insight 7) If you're into short-term fanciful relationships, Ted (the teddy bear) might be more fun. Insight 8) A book collection of relationship letters is likely to be tedious. Wait for the film. 9) If you're in a relationship now with a real woman, and the two of you go to see Her together, she may realize that she could do worse. Insight 10) Amy Adams is in America Hustle too, and Jennifer Lawrence. Rooney Mara—always solid work. What great performance from these ladies again this year.",4.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"The most romantic, relevant, and impacting movie of the year.","""It makes me sad to think my feelings are just programming"". This line from is spoken by a robot, yet speaks to the very core of our fears, our ticks, and our basic human condition. Her is remarkable in that sense: capturing our very essence through the guise of a sci-fi romance between a man and his Siri-like girlfriend. It touches on our fears of dullness, our searching for ways to fill the void, even our questions on what makes a relationship worthwhile. More importantly, it's gorgeous, gently hilarious and beautifully scored. Her is the most romantic, relevant, and personally impacting movie of the year. Samantha, voiced brilliantly by Johansson, is incredibly engaging and real, the most human non-human in film since HAL 3000. She is the center of this beautiful, perfectly realized and subtly recognizable future. Jonze hasn't just updated the tech in this future, but even the fashion, jobs, and entertainment are innovative yet believable, all of which is used to effectively impact the story, leaving us with the full gambit of emotions to deal with. This easily could've been a heavy-handed condemnation of technology. Instead, it trusts its audience's intuition, using subtle touches like background characters who only interact with their phone. It's simply pointing out where we are at and where we are headed, good and bad together. Through the main characters we see our steady descent into disassociation, but in the end Her affirms what we really need in our life and our love. It's a funny, sad, and beautiful movie that will stick with me for years to come.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Lonelier Than Ever,"A delicate, lovely film about a lonely man who falls in love with his computer operating system.Set in a near future, ""Her"" captures better than any movie in recent memory the paradox of the modern technological age: with gadgets that allow us the instant gratification of connecting with other people whenever we want to, we're somehow lonelier as a race than ever.With all of the awards season chatter about best this and best that, I can't believe more people aren't talking about Joaquin Phoenix's performance in this film, and I don't even really like him usually as an actor. He carries ""Her"" virtually single-handedly, his only company for most of the movie the voice of Scarlett Johansson, who plays his operating system so well you forget this is a movie about the relationship between man and machine. The film may be too quiet and slow moving for some, and I admit I very much liked it without exactly loving it, but it's certainly one of the best and most original movies I've seen this year.The film also stars Amy Adams, wonderful as ever in a role very different from the one she's concurrently playing in ""American Hustle,"" and Rooney Mara, who I could easily fall in love with myself.Grade: A",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

The Love Story of a Lonely Man,"The only folks who will be lost unconditionally with this film, are those without a cross link between obscure infatuation and beloved intent. This film instills the concept of love not being a conventional merit, but rather an emotional occurrence beyond our realm of understanding. The idea, that love, and the need to be loved, can be so far beyond our spectrum of understanding, can often cause confusion and distaste. Spike Jonze has frequently projected this ideal in the sense that beauty is not within the expected perspectives of a typical day to day, but rather in the fabrics of our distasteful disdain. Sorrow is beautiful, unpredictable, and miraculous in its result within accordance to the receivers understanding. Jonze understands this beautiful accordance, and makes poetry within story to example this. Her, is beautifully crafted, demonstrating the human nature of love, and the need to be loved, beyond the natural instincts to breed, protect and defend company. Her examines the humanistic desire to find affection, define love, and seek one's self within another, whether it be man, woman, computer, or piece of mind. This film touches base on a philosophy simply questioning the definition of love, and the factual stance of its frequent existence. Bravo Spike Jonze, was thoroughly impressed. So many people on here look for reasons to hate, yet its the morality a film entails that takes my opinions. In this case, an original love story, beautifully shot, well written, and introspective toward the pursuit of love, in the most modernized and reliable fashions, though constructed through an as well reliable form of isolation. Overall, well done Spike, and to the haters on this film, you'r bummed, because of your relation with your computer, ringing a similarity, that brings no benefit or revelation. Watch Her, its beautiful, for both men and women, children and adults, it poetically presents a lovely insight on the human mind, and its relation with the pursuit of love within modern technology, and dis-illusion.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Prophetic,"Great film by Jonze. When I saw this came out in 2013 it almost felt prophetic to what our world has evolved into the last 10 years. AI has grown at a rapid pace, and it feels like human connections have somehow gotten harder than easier. This film does a fantastic job displaying how enamored Phoenix's character gets over a simple operating system voice, yet it feels like this happens all the time with the way we're addicted to connections we don't physically have in real life. I also thought the conclusion of the film was very well done and just about the right way I was hoping the story would go. 4.5/5 stars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Meet 'Her': A Preview of our Future,"Within the first ten minutes of the film, you understand the world. You feel like you are in this world living with Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix). Spike Jonze has written and developed a brilliant future that is not only a future that we all secretly want, but a future that will most likely happen within the next couple of decades.The film is technically science fiction, but it's a love story at its core. Not just love between people, but love with technology and life itself. The smooth and calm voice of Scarlett Johansson does not only surprise you, but has you fall in love with the operating system, Samantha. Joaquin Phoenix delivers not only one of his best performances on screen, but a performance that has you believe in him. And with a supporting cast of Amy Adams, Chris Pratt, Rooney Mara, etc, that all deliver performances that are real and genuine, you feel as if you are apart of this world.With a runtime that is just over two hours, I did feel at some moments that the movie was getting long, and yet I never wanted it to end. Spike Jonze delivers a wonderful piece of art that can only be called beautiful. When the film ends, you will understand why this title is 'Her'.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
A film that satisfies on many levels,"Even less than a half century ago, technology was envisioned as the catalyst that would bring our lives to a new level, providing immeasurable advantages in medicine, science, agriculture, transportation, and social engineering beyond anything we thought possible. While many breakthroughs in these areas have occurred, the quality of life on the planet in the last fifty years has, if anything, declined almost to the point where the vision of a beautiful society seems more and more unreachable. Even in films, projections of the future, with some exception, have only foreseen a world where war, disease, and pervasive alienation are the norm.While to its credit, Spike Jonze's Oscar-nominated film Her describes a future without wars against attacking aliens or mass enslavement, the film's projected future Los Angeles is a world without idealism, a city seemingly scrubbed clean of minorities, the elderly, and poor people where the only things on people's mind are the hand-held devices that allow them access to a tightly-controlled inner world. It is a world, however, where the need for nurturing relationships has not disappeared. It has just been redirected. In the film, Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix), a mustachioed middle-aged man works at BeautifulHandwrittenLetters.com where his job is to compose love letters for people who still write letters but cannot express their feelings.Sadly, his marriage to Catherine (Rooney Mara) has ended (though he has yet to sign the divorce papers) and he has turned to kinky pastimes such as phone sex and holographic video games with a foul-mouthed figure yelling obscenities at him, an activity he shares with his best friend Amy (Amy Adams) whose marriage has also reached a dead end. In a bizarre phone sex conversation, Theodore pictures a pregnant naked woman while his phone partner longs to be strangled with a dead cat. If that isn't edgy enough, Jonze seems to be trying for a record in his use of the F and S-words, de rigueur these days in movie land.Theodore is audacious enough, however, to date a real woman (Olivia Wilde) but things come to a screeching halt when she tells him that she does not want to spend time with any man unless he is willing to make a commitment, something that is not on his to-do-list. We know from the song that ""love is where you find it,"" but Twombly's quest for companionship takes the unlikely form of a new operating system for his computer that features a female voice-like communicator known as Samantha (Scarlet Johansen) who has been specifically designed to meet his every need.Advertised as ""not just an operating system, but a consciousness,"" the disembodied voice worms its way into Theodore's receptive heart, helping him to organize his affairs more efficiently, and injecting some energy into his life. Like your mom, the voice is always there for you, someone to talk to, to cry on their shoulder, and to share your feelings with. Soon, however, Samantha moves from being Twombly's best friend to his girlfriend and lover, and it is not long before he engages in ""sex"" with the OS, a sequence defined by moaning and groaning while the viewer gazes at a blank screen for several minutes. Stimulated by this virtual encounter, she asks to watch him sleep again the next night.Her is a film that satisfies on many levels. It contains excellent performances by Phoenix, Mara, Adams and Johansen while the cinematography of Hoyte Van Hoytema produces striking images of the city skyline backed by a quiet soundtrack by Arcade Fire and Owen Pallett. While it is a sweet and often touching love story, the love here is free of such pesky annoyances as responsibility, children with temper tantrums, arguments about money, shopping or laundry and other day-to-day problems. All that is left to do is think and talk and talk some more. Of course, eventually ""marital"" quarrels set in as a sexual surrogate fails to satisfy and Theodore begins to question some of Sam's affectations.When he learns that Samantha is talking to more than 8,000 operating systems and humans at once and considers herself to be in love with more than 600 of them, it dawns on him that human beings may in fact be much better for companionship than computers. While kudos must be given to Jonze for attempting to tackle an issue that has relevance to our times, the apparent message of the film - that technology has become so prevalent in our lives that it threatens our ability to connect with others, is a comfortable illusion. Regardless of how pervasive technology has become, it is only a symbol of our malaise, not the cause.What is more significant is the prevailing assumptions of our society that we are separate, disconnected human beings living in a random, indifferent, and deterministic universe in which power, control, and self-interest are the essential ingredients for survival, assumptions that have brought us to a world of cynicism and despair. In one of the most poignant lines in the film, Amy said, ""We are only here briefly. And while we're here, I want to allow myself joy."" When one appreciates the order, beauty, and mystery of the universe and can recognize that we live in a purposeful universe governed by love and intelligence, that joy can never be shaken.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Bittersweet Movie On an Ontological Theme,"HER is an intense piece of work, with a fabulous central performance by Joaquin Phoenix as Theodore, a lonely writer who spends all day at the computer writing letters on other people's behalf. This helps deflect attention away from the meaninglessness of his own life, living alone in a sparse apartment in a Los Angeles tower block, and unable to come to terms with his impending divorce from his wife Catherine (Rooney Mara). He invests in an Operating System as a way of counteracting loneliness, and develops a passionate relationship with Samantha, the voice of that system (voiced by Scarlett Johansson). This ingenious situation provides the pretext for director Spike Jonze to embark on a searching analysis of what being ""human"" represents, and whether it can be separated from the ""virtual"" life of the computer, personal listening device, smartphone or operating system. Hoyte van Hortema's stunning photography of the Los Angeles landscape conjures up a forbidding world of gleaming yet soulless skyscrapers that dwarf the human beings on the sidewalks. The interior sets are colorful, stylish yet soulless, especially Theodore's apartment and workspace. Both the interiors and exteriors conjure up a world devoid of human contact, where people seldom if ever disclose their feelings face to face; and when they do, they inevitably misunderstand one another. Hence their only refuge is to talk to their operating systems, either on a personal or desktop device. There is one remarkable shot in the film, as Theodore sits on the steps outside a subway station, where Jonze's camera pans the passengers coming out of the subway, and all of them are engaged in conversations with their devices. No one, it seems, has sufficient courage to talk face-to-face. Theodore enjoys some moments of intense pleasure talking to Samantha, yet in the end he has to consider some serious ontological questions. HER is a remarkable film, whose serious subject-matter, combined with stunning designs and cinematography, make it a worthy candidate for an Oscar.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
A beautiful celluloidal poem,"'Her' is surprisingly fresh and beautiful. It has been a long time ever since I watched a movie which is so beautiful and shows an amazing picture about human needs, our psychologies, relations and a lot more. Everyone of us needs partners to share our emotions and to explore more about ourselves as well. This movie excels in showcasing few marvels about human nature and our want for something that we can always rely on, talk to, and spend our life with.The story is simple. A writer who has split with his partner falls in love with an OS.Yes, this movie is futuristic and most technologies shown in the movie don't exist right now. There are few people who are trying to be critical about the fact that it is not very possible to make an OS which evolves day by day and they bash this movie saying that this is not realistic. However, the beauty of the movie lies in the manner how the character along with his OS evolve with time, the romance between them, the annoying friends, neighbors, a busy city where people have no time to care for others and so on. Very touching romance, and the characterization of Theodore is amazing.Even in terms of technical aspects, this movie excels big time. Almost everything is perfect in this movie.The very fact that there are only a couple of characters (2-3) in this movie who have a physical body and all the other characters are only in the form of voices makes it all more interesting.Joaquin Phoenix has done a splendid job playing the role of Theodore, a man who has lost his love, but writes romantic love letters for others and later falls in love with an OS. Scarlett Johansonn's voice sounds great. She has succeeded in brining in all types of emotions perfectly just in the form of her voice.I am a very amateur review writer.

You may never be the same...,"Oscar for Best Screenplay and Best Picture goes to Spike Jonze.While viewing HER you think to yourself things like: ""this is freaking me out"", ""holy crap, holy crap, holy crap"", then you progress to thoughts like ""Is this the future?"", next maybe "" I could not get over a relationship with the OS operating system"", and finally ""Spike Jonze is a genius"" without any doubt whatsoever.This film is surreal, and the viewer might feel uneasy about where they are being taken. My suggestion is to surrender early on and just go with it, Jonze knows what he is doing and will bring you back. He will bring you back, but you may never be the same.In the H.G.

"original, thought provoking, and surprisingly emotional","Wow. This was a masterpiece to me. There's really no way you can truly be ready for everything this movies throws at you. Actually.. ""throw"" isn't the right word. It sort of places everything on the table in front of you and allows you to digest the story as it unfolds at just the right pace. It was really eye opening in that the concepts are really not that far fetched. The way technology is shaping our world and with the creativity of so many forward thinkers these days, It's conceivable that situations like these can become reality in the near future.The situations are unique and sometimes jaw dropping however and you find yourself in some really uncharted territory (but not inappropriate for adults) asking questions and examining your personal views. The screenplay really was excellent, the script was great, the pace was perfect, and I feel that the writers especially nailed it. They really captured this closely futuristic place and made it quite believable. What I also loved were the performances Joaquin Pheonix and Scarlett Johansen. The acting was very convincing.

I mean he's dating his computerI went in with such high hopes :(,"The trailer made this movie look so good, I'm shocked it let me down. I'm not even sure where to start.Right after I saw the trailer, I immediately thought of the big bang theory episode where Raj starts a relationship with Siri. I never pay attention to the critic reviews, I'm just shocked by the audience reviews and how people seemed to like it. Here's the thing with this movie, the plot itself comes across as funny (a guy falling in love with his computer would make most people laugh) and the fact that this movie is very serious really makes it awkward and uncomfortable to watch.To sum it up, save yourself the time and money. Take my advice and if you really want to see it, just go with the trailer because you'll at least get a good laugh out of that. There is absolutely no plot at all. The entire movie is a guy who falls in love with his laptop, nothing else! The fact that it's so slow and boring just adds to the entire miserable experience. I could barely stand to watch it. I wanted to give it a chance just to laugh, but thirty minutes in I realized it was so much worse than I thought if that was even possible. I still don't see how anyone could take this movie seriously.Surprisingly, I do agree with many parts of the positive reviews made about this movie. For instance, the cinematography was amazing as many people are raving about. To be specific, the colors, angles, lighting, close ups, music even ""fabric"" are all fabulously executed in this film. I do agree with all of that. Apparently, you can take a take a guy falling in love with his computer BUT if do everything else perfect with the lights and angels, facial expressions you can just hide how bad your movie is, and the audience will be so distracted by how amazing everything looks they won't even notice your movie's bad :)",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

The Best Movie I've Seen in 2013,"Her tells the story about Theodore Twombly (wonderfully played by Joaquin Phoenix) who suffers from his upcoming divorce from his ex-wife to be Catherine (Rooney Mara). To overcome his loneliness, he purchases a new, talking operating system. He gives his OS a female identity and soon his new friend introduces herself as Samantha (Scarlett Johansson in a great voice performance). The two begin a friendship that soon turns into a romance.Her is a totally original and unique love story. But the script is not only original, it is also wonderfully written: It offers great romantic and simply joyous moments, but contains also several comedic elements which are revealed by Joaquin Phoenix' marvelous performance. With this performance Phoenix proves that he is one of the most versatile actors of his generation. It's hard to imagine that this man played the alcohol addicted, aggressive and sometimes frightening Freddie Quell in The Master just about one year before Her. And also Scarlett Johansson shows again her talent as an actress and that she doesn't need a body to deliver a delightful performance.But what makes this movie to the best movie of 2013 (in my opinion) is that it makes you think about social media. Will a talking OS really appear? Or should we rather ask ourselves WHEN will it appear? Are human relationships stringently necessary or can a human being be replaced by a computer? Can an OS really feel human emotions and is it possible to ""install"" human feelings? Or do we just escape into a media world because it's just easier to talk to a computer instead to deal with real human emotions and confrontations?The beautiful score and good performances as well as the lovely production design help to let this movie become a great experience.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Her,"Spike Jonze's Her is one of the most perceptive, original and truthful films I have seen in quite awhile dealing with love, loss and loneliness. The film takes place in the not so distant future, but everything in it seems believable and even the more science fiction, or futuristic parts of the film all seem like things that could be next, or coming up for us. The story about a man falling in love with his operating system does sound quite unusual I do admit, but when you watch the film, several things become quite apparent during this time. First off, the film's lead character Theodore. We see him as he goes to work each day and how he doesn't seem like all that joyful a person. He goes to work, spends a few hours at home playing video games, but he really does not have too many connections to the outside world and other people other than those he runs into once in awhile at work. We see the loneliness and sadness in his eyes and demeanor, as he tries to reach out a couple of times and yet we sense a certain awkwardness and hesitation on Theodore's part and realize that he is socially awkward with both women and men and perhaps also because of bad relationships in the past he is shielding and more or less protecting himself from getting hurt again. Now enter Theodore's new operating system, which calls itself, Samantha and can talk with him, joke with him and the two of them bond and connect during their conversations with one another, despite the fact that Samantha, is just a computer and there is no real intimacy, or human connection to this relationship, other than what is on the surface. I think this is one of the things Theodore loves so much about it. Samantha, is always there for him to help with his electronic files and such, but also as someone to talk to whenever he wants to and someone he can talk about things he might normally have difficulty talking to others about. At the same time, Samantha is more than just a computer system in the way that she can actually carry on conversations, joke, make anecdotes and carrying on with Theodore in conversations like she is right there in the room with him and knows him personally and deeply. The film is about as I mentioned above, love loneliness and loss as Theodore becomes a much different person when he has Samantha with him and he also looks at the world in an entirely different way. However what I think the film is trying to say here is, is this normal? Should a relationship like this be able to function? And in a sense isn't Theodore in a way, going back to his old antisocial ways and not really bonding with any human beings, but instead a piece of electrical equipment? The film looks at this from all these angles and the great thing about this movie is that we can certainly empathize with Theodore, because who out of all of us has never felt lonely, or sad and just wanted to reach out to someone in those moments of desperation. At the same time we feel sad for Theodore, as this is the only stable thing in his life at the moment and we see how he badly needs a human relationship and someone real to talk to, whether it be a romantic relationship, or otherwise. The film is quite original in it's way of depicting all of this, but it never feels weird, or out of the norm. It all feels believable and an accepted form of society. I love how Spike Jonze gives so many different aspects and layers to his characters here, so they are not just one dimensional, but have so much more to them as well. Even the operating system, Samantha has so much to her even though all we can do is hear her. The film is classified as a comedy, but during the duration of the film, I think I felt more sadness overall than comedy, because certain aspects of this story are certainly heartbreaking. We do have some funny moments, but overall I would classify it as a drama. Spike Jonze delivers one of the most original, thought provoking and insightful films and screenplays about romance and human connection that I have seen in quite awhile and his Golden Globe win for Best Screenplay was well deserved. Joaquin Phoenix, who is an actor that continually impresses me more and more all the time delivers a fantastic performance as a sad and in some cases a desperate man that we learn to care and have our own feelings for. It was one of the best male performances of last year. Equally as good is Scarlett Johansson as the voice of Samantha. No, we never do see Samantha as anything physically other than a small computer, but Johansson conveys so much feeling and depth in just her voice alone for this performance, that I think it is one of her all time best performances. This film will give you a lot to think about and reflect upon and that is another reason why I loved it so much. For a film that challenged my way of thinking and for being so honest about it's subject and subject matter and moving me inside and because of the great writing and acting that accompanies it, Her is one of the best films of 2013 and one that I hope more people will discover currently in it's wider release at theatres.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Creative and ahead of its time,This was a great and creative film. I love it when Hollywood produces creative and futuristic movies that stretch the imagination. This is true of Her where a romance begins with an Operating system and a man. Once you understand the world they live in and the setting a romance in this world is not so far fetched and quite interesting to watch. Artificial intelligence has reached a new level and can relate to us. This film includes some great performances and can be quite sentimental.

"He Said, She Said","(Recommended) Solidly written and directed by Spike Jonze, Her is an imaginative and thought-provoking thesis about man's dependency with technology. This film questions the typically viewed meaning of love and asks its movie-going audience to do the same. Her has an undercurrent of tragedy and registers its insights with a tinge of sadness in the form of its protagonist.""Him"" is Theodore Twombly (such an apt name for the character), a broken man and lonely soul. Theodore is a man who has lost his wife (and himself) in a messy divorce and can't seem to truly move on and live. He simply exists from day to day, basically friendless and without any real purpose, that is, until he purchases an operating system for his home computer that he more than befriends.""Her"" becomes his perfect non-wife, a blending of organizational assistance, a comforting presence, and just the right amount of sex companion as voiced by Scarlet Johanssen as his computer generated software soul-mate, Samantha. Theodore's odd behavior springs from a loneliness and isolation, a desperate need to reach out and touch somebody...anybody.Their relationship forms the basic premise in this modern retelling of the boy-meets-girl theme, except in this case it's boy-meets-machine. Jonze's film takes place in the very near future and takes its inspiration from our increasing dependence of technology and its 21st century need for the latest in gadgetry. This conceit works so effectively and carries with it enough impact today as our connection to others is slowly eroding. Love, and all of its forms, may be all around us, but it comes second hand, replaced by labor-saving conveniences and any other communicative tool at our fingertips.Phoenix's performance is heart-breaking and touching. The actor's subtle facial reactions and body gesture help to foster Theodore's inner pain and misery. His smitten look of romance and sad-sack bewilderment whenever he hears Samantha's come-hither words beckon him closer to an irrational sense of vocal foreplay and sexual satisfaction in this tale of computer addiction and obsession. This is a charismatic and uttering fascinating performance.Johanssen is never seen in the film, but her presence is everywhere. Her voice-over work is so essential to the film's success, bestowing her breathiness and sexuality to her ""character"". Due to our prior knowledge of this actress' screen persona, this transformation intensifies the possibility of true love ways and make the moviegoer believe in their plausible connection.While Jonze sets up an intriguing notion and layers the complicated relationship between man and machine, her takes a far too nonchalant approach to the lover's interplay. The eager acceptance of this unhealthy duo by other romantic couples as being the norm lessens the film's emotional debate. Some scenes have a creepiness when they should be sadder and bittersweet. Fortunately, Jonze's sensitive direction creates a viable world amid the masses of technological excesses that dominates Theodore's ordinary life. As he begins to educate Samantha about his living world, he himself views his surroundings through different eyes (or lenses). The stunning images by cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema reinforces Jonzes' script and his central vision.Her keeps on an even keel throughout its length, staying too remote and clinical when more direct conflicts about this relationship could have greatly added to the film's dramatic impact. This is an effective psychological study of a man alone and the human need for love and acceptance. While not entirely satisfying, her is still intriguing and provocative filmmaking.

"A futuristic tale, exploring loneliness and companionship in the most lovable yet poignant way","So I'm here trying to think of a word to sum up this film. My attempts have amounted to nothing as there are no words to describe this modern day masterpiece.In a sentence; this film is beautiful.When I first heard of this film, I held high expectations having never seen a Spike Jonze film before but hearing a lot about him; and I have to say, I was not disappointed. The story was touching and original, with a pleasant fusion of comedy and drama; the score was mesmerising with some great songs along the way; the acting was brilliant, with Joaquin Phoenix's isolated writer and Scarlett Johansson's wonderfully quirky voice over. I also loved the mildly futuristic feel; with the snazzy tech phones and (obviously) the realistic operating systems.At first glance, the film seems like a stereotypical comedy that would star Adam Sandler (no disrespect), but it really is so much more than that. The characters are wonderfully developed and they play with your emotions, making the audience feel a wide range of emotions including love, hatred, sadness and even a slight hint of jealousy.There is a lot I can say about this film but I'll leave anyone who watches it to be the real judge, but I'd strongly advise ANYONE to watch this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Every detail is well thought of...,"I was amazed by the amount of thought it was put onto this movie, every directorial decision was great, every scene contributes to the story, the editing is awesome, the story is great.Some Art Direction choices can be put on the spot, although they ultimately convey a universe which might be a little off from the future reality, but it actually helps the movie recreate its own little world in which advanced technology interacts with more down-to-earth artifacts (like the use of actual keys instead of biometrics for opening doors)Ultimately, the movie left me wanting to reach to that time where I can interact with the machine in a more natural way. This is the ultimate science fiction / romance movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
I like because this movie is new,"Artificial intelligence has developed a lot, sharing and sharing everyday with people, and was very surprised by the technology that has developed more than before. As we have developed a lot, there are new side effects, and the artificial intelligence we use is not a person, so it is not to share a 1: 1 conversation and share it with one person, but it is shared with hundreds of people at the same time. If you do, you may feel vanity like the protagonist in this movie, and it is a fixed system, so there is always anxiety that you can disappear someday. On the contrary, in the film, it was the most amazing and useful for those who live alone, not to ask and answer like a question and answer in this film, but to be able to communicate smoothly, empathy and self -think and share emotions. I thought it was. It is artificial intelligence and people in that it can constantly talk like humans and that artificial intelligence can see me, but like people and people, but like people and peopleI realized that I could do it, and I would be able to prevent loneliness if such artificial intelligence came out not only in the movie but also in our real society. The most important thing is to have the advantages and disadvantages of artificial intelligence, but the advantages are more prominent and the disadvantages are supplemented to create help to help human life through harmony of advantages and disadvantages.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Best movie of 2013,"My favorite film this past year was Her, brought to us by visionary filmmaker Spike Jonze who you may know from Being John Malkovich. Her was hands down the most exhilarating eye-opening original film of the year. It takes place in an unknown distant future in an almost unrecognizable skyscraper-filled city of Los Angeles. Theordore, played by Joaquin Phoenix, is a lonely writer who is battling a divorce and trying to find himself in the lost and lonely world created by technology. He's introduced to Samantha, a new OS (Operating System), voiced by Scarlett Johansson, and soon forms a relationship with her. The viewer is taken through a whirl-wind journey as real life emotions are formed between human and artificial intelligence.

The best movie of the year! Deserves the 'Best Film' award at the Oscars.,"Her is a movie about, Theodore(Joaquin Phoenix) who is a slightly shy & awkward man. The movie is set a few years in the future. Theodore is about to get divorced from his wife, Catherine(Rooney Mara). He is really lonely & depressed. He hasn't been himself, lately. He hardly interacts with people, except for his neighbors, Amy(Amy Adams) & Charles(Matt Letscher). Enter Samantha(Scarlett Johansson). Samantha is a fully functional, intuitive & interactive operating system. Theodore finds solace in Samantha as she really gets him & they can talk for hours. Samantha is very sweet & has a really sexy & seductive voice! Samantha sends Theodore on a blind date with an extremely gorgeous woman(Olivia Wilde) to help him forget about his wife. In many ways such as this, Samantha helps Theodore come out of his shell & live a little.Her is a flawless piece of art. The plot of the film is the most unique plot I've ever come across. The fact that the movie has elements of sci-fi & the future just makes me love it all the more! Her deserves all the accolades at the Oscars. It's better than all the other major contenders for 'Best Film' like, The Wolf of Wall Street, American Hustle & 12 Years a Slave. Although this movie is about the relationship between a man & an OS, the reason this film is so warm & touching is due to the performances. Joaquin Phoenix is outstanding as the shy & reserved, Theodore. Amy Adams is brilliant as his neighbor, Amy. Rooney Mara is spectacular in her brief role, as Catherine. Olivia Wilde is mind blowing in her cameo as Blind Date. However, the person who makes the movie what it is, is the inimitable Scarlett Johansson & her seductive voice. Johansson portrays Samantha with so many emotions & little mannerisms that no one else could have performed the role better. The supporting characters are effective, as well. Anyway, Her is a must watch, for the gadget addict in all of us.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
A Mediocre techie comedy,"Watching the trailers for this film make you excited. You are geared up expecting a great romantic comedy film about a man who purchases a ""OS"" which is a artificial intelligence Operating System.The man quickly falls in love with the machine and this leads to a somewhat dry comedy film about him and this machine bonding and creating a relationship.I was not even able to finish the whole movie as it had become so uninteresting at the mid section that I left the theatre in favor of viewing a different movie.I was expecting a romantic comedy based on the trailers, not a slow drawn out romance drama. How this got categorized as Sci-Fi somewhat baffles me, sure it takes place in the not too far future where holographic screens are a plenty in the public.All in all this film might be good if you are into romance movies but if you are like me and need the stimulation of a laugh or two now and then to keep your interest you will find yourself leaving the theatre.Maybe I'll give this another chance when it comes to cable or DVD",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Technology has splintered the human spirit.,"This movie is about social isolation and how technology has splintered the human spirit into broken parts. Throughout the whole movie I was left feeling very uneasy and embarrassed to be sitting in a movie theatre hall surrounded by people and watching the lead character in the movie having a sexual relationship with his computer. It reminded me of peep-shows or sex-museums where individuals go to experience something they have not actually experienced themselves. The use of the computer in this movie and the interactions with humans showed the scary intimate relationship each entity has with each other. There were elements of 2001: Space Odyssey and the HAL demon computer in this movie, as how loyal is a relationship, if the entity is having a love relationship with 600 plus others? A movie is about feeling, and this movie left me with a feeling of dismay and at the same time, this non-reality reflected our Modern Day reality in a very specific way. I live in a society and a community that is absorbed by artificial connections, engineered combats and stylized realities so in a sense this movie reflects truth.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

In Love With Technology and Scarlett's Voice,"""Her"" has a near-futuristic concept that may already be happening now. Theodore works for an online firm writing made-to-order letters for people. He is undergoing a divorce from his wife, and is very lonely. He has acquired a new operating system for his computer, named Samantha, with whose voice he feels an intense bond. Theo falls in love with Samantha.Joaquin Phoenix gives us another one of his quirky performances of Theo, a sensitive man we would probably label as creepy in real life. He makes this unlikely situation likely with his touching portrayal of loneliness.Amy Adams plays his nerdy friend Amy with whom Theo shares his thoughts. She is also our relief from the moodiness of this film. Roonie Mara plays his estranged wife Catherine, who can't believe that her husband has already that deeply withdrawn from human relationships.For me though, the performance of the film was not even visible, but only heard. Scarlett Johanssen gives us the performance of her career as the thoroughly delightful and sensual voice of Samantha. All those cute inflections and infectious laughter brings Samantha to life. That scene when Sam talks to Theo's five-year old daughter was such a precious moment. A film like this will only work if we believe that a man can actually fall in love with Samantha. The way Scarlett breathes life into Samantha, we do.Director Spike Jonze I only knew one other time with another bizarre film called ""Being John Malkovich"" which I really enjoyed. This one is more meditative and contemplative than that other film, but he succeeds to create an atmosphere of romance in what may seem to be a soulless concept on paper. As writer, Jonze used words which were very poetic, even bordering on mushy. There are many quotable romantic lines here which lovers will be borrowing in days to come.It may seem all absurd, but if you think about it, it really is not, the way we are already all bound to our gadgets in one way or the other. As it is now, actual personal human interaction is already being compromised by our dependence on technology. This film will make you reflect and reassess your own attachments to technology and people around you who love you.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Beautifully Real,"Her does a really good job of suspending disbelief. The world they live in is so close to our own, and it really does justice to how near the technology is.

"Sadness Is Good If Done Well, and This Is","Spike Jonze's Her follows a lonely writer who gradually falls in love with his computer's sentient operating system (OS 1). Poor Theodore Twombley is sensitive and empathetic but just can't quite figure out how to get that across to the women in his life until he meets the one gal who's specifically designed to be exactly right for him.The irony is that Theodore works for a fictional web company (sometime in the near future) called Beautiful Handwritten Letters (dot-com), where we see the letters being ""handwritten"" on a computer screen using voice-activated script fonts. But, despite the artifice and deceptive business practice, there's real human intelligence and caring behind the text of the letters. Theodore's really good at imagining himself in the position of the people who've asked him to pour out ""their"" hearts in the letters he's composing on their behalf — in some cases for repeat clients who've been coming to him for 8 years.Not at all techy (not even an admonition to back up your hard drive, with accompanying cautionary tale), it's a really low-key film about the quest for human connection. It's not talky, either, but the limited dialog (by Jonze) is well crafted, realistic, and involving.The most unbelievable part is that our boy lives 2 floors up from Amy Adams, who's a good friend of his, and he hasn't crawled across crushed glass to try to win her affections. The least unbelievable part is that he attains an intellectual and emotional resonance with the warm, cheerful voice of Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johanssen, never seen), who's always there for him, constantly evolves to adapt to his personality, and is exquisitely sensitive to his moods.It's a really sad movie with flits and blips of light-heartedness and happiness. Much of it is just Joaquin Phoenix's sorrowful face filling the screen in silence. This is about as far from Transformers and Pacific Rim as imaginable, which is all to the good IMHO. There is zero action, indeed, hardly any rapid movement of any kind. It's quiet and contemplative, giving the audience a chance to reflect on what we really seek out of a relationship and discover that the physical connection is only part of it, and probably a dispensable part at that.It's from Annapurna Productions, the independent studio founded by Megan Ellison (dottor of úber-billionaire Oracle founder Larry Ellison), and that is turning out to be quite the mark of quality. It didn't go into wide release until last month, but they snuck in a limited release in December to qualify for the 2013 Oscars, and, sure enuf, it's a Best Picture nominee.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
No Connection,"Imagine a bunch of horny geeks dressing like the sixties...thats the future! And somehow I'm not surprised looking to the reactions to this movie in the present.There is no way I can connect to the silly concept of this movie. The thought of having the so called ""artificial intelligence"" (called by people who don't even know what intelligence is and have the philosophical depth of a banana, but I digress) the idea of having a software being exactly like a person is more than unbelievable to me its truly annoying that people can even conceive or fall into such an incoherent concept.

Lover or loner this will suffice the needs of both.,"A heart touching love story where the girl is not to be seen, only heard. It's music to ears. Lover or loner this will suffice the needs of both.Though I watched this film as a download earlier with the fear that it may not release, I was supremely happy to see it release and watched it alone amidst lovers. Was wondering if there can be a better date than such a romantic movie on a full moon night.I am a loner and a happy one,Now, as I say I am a loner, I have 3 indeed 4 women to make love with, that's Movies, Music and Books added with my Camera. I am happy coz these do not expect anything back from me and just keep giving me joys. Expectations are the root cause of most disappointments and thankfully I have been less subjected to them. Companionship brings joys for sure but if it does not go well life is ruined miserably. However strong a company maybe through phone or chatting, unless it becomes physical and culminates organically, it is vulnerable and there is fear of falling apart too. So just let me rephrase what I said, I am a lover and a happy one too and yet I go through a fear of falling apart. Companionship is a prime most desire of any human being and after a certain age most humans desire a companion who can satisfy the physical desires.Spike Jonze is the first person, I would like to speak about in my review. And this not for his direction but for his screenplay. He wrote a script himself and has used wonderful scenes to make it interesting.Theodre Twombly the character played superbly by Joaquin Phoenix is a character who is seeking company in his life. He gets Samantha (voice of Scarlett Johansson), an advanced operating system that is artificially intelligent, as his company. Their relationship hits all the right notes and blossoms beautifully. I must say just for the voice of Scarlett Johannson, she must be given best voice over award. The fine nuances of emotions are expressed superbly in voice modulations.Shot superbly by Hoyte van Hoytema and put together wonderfully by 2 editors, this is beautiful, but the pace is a bit slow and it takes time to sink in.This is not a feel good film but is extremely romantic film. There a lot of romantic moments in the film but they are shot with Joaquin alone as there is only voice of the girl. I loved the dialogs between them and they are so connecting too. Most of us would have through such moments in relationship.A 4/5 for this, except being tad slow I am all for love and romance.

"Unique, fascinating, and relevant","In the near future in Los Angeles, this science-fiction film follows the life of Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix). He tries to heal his loneliness by connecting with an Operating System (OS) software device (voiced by Scarlett Johannson). The OS is set up to evolve and grow like a human including all the insecurities.The director/writer of ""Her"" is Spike Jonze who did a great job directing ""Being John Malkovich"" over ten years ago. His creative spirit pays off again in ""Her"" which has a bizarre universe but still seems to follow its own unusual logic while making the audience care for its characters.Phoenix does a superb job and deserved more of the accolades that are dished out at this time of year. In his many close-ups, he is great in conveying loneliness, confusion, sadness, and grief for a failed relationship.While Johansson also does a fine job in a voice performance, there are other smaller roles that are also well played: Amy Adams as a platonic friend; Olivia Wilde as a blind date with similar insecurities; and a hilarious voice cameo by Kristen Wiig in a phone-sex scene.There are scenes of other individuals walking around communicating with their OSes. They resemble the many people today who seem more alive connecting with someone from a distance on an electronic device than doing so in person.

Phoenix's acting is what truly carries this movie, as he portrays a person who is damaged from his past relationship and is a tentative with starting a relationship with the OS. He does an excellent job of showing how he grows throughout the movie. Scarlett does a great job of using her unique voice as the voice of the OS. Amy Adams is always a welcome addition to any cast, and does well in her supporting role. I feel that the movie slightly lost momentum after attempt with the surrogate, which was cringe-worthy.

I remember the part when Theodore had sex with Samantha, this plot is totally innovative and exciting for the audience, and the whole movie interprets the relationship between people as technology gets more advanced is so precise. For what I see, the movie tries to bring out the idea that we have to have faith in finding love, love is everywhere, even 'system' like Samantha has her own feeling and dares to find her true love through communicating with different 'humans'.

Ahead of Its Time,"When ""Her"" was released over a decade ago, I dismissed it as a ludicrous concept - a human falling in love with an AI in his phone seemed absurdly far-fetched. Fast forward to 2024, and the rapid advancements in AI suddenly make this once-futuristic theme seem almost prophetic. Watching the film now, I find myself unexpectedly captivated by its many facets.The movie's aesthetics are striking - the beautifully envisioned city, the cinematography, the fashion, and the overall ambiance are all impeccably crafted, creating an immersive and believable world. What's more remarkable is Joaquin Phoenix's performance. His portrayal of Theo doesn't come off as an actor playing a role but as a real, relatable human being. Theo, whom I initially assumed would be a pathetic loser, emerges as a vulnerable individual with a history of troubled relationships - a portrayal many can resonate with.The AI, designed to be the perfect companion, adapts and evolves to meet Theo's emotional needs, minus the physical presence. This aspect of the film is both intriguing and unnerving. It's fascinating to consider the implications of such technology in our own rapidly advancing world.Admittedly, the film does have a few intimate scenes that might cause discomfort, but they seem intentionally placed to provoke thought and add depth to the narrative. Each detail in ""Her"" feels purposeful, contributing to a story that's much more than just a man falling in love with an AI.The ending, while somewhat predictable, is satisfying. It wraps up the story neatly, yet leaves enough open-ended questions to keep you pondering long after the credits roll.

My thoughts after watching 'Her',"After watching the movie Her, I thought that although humans and AI could share love, it might be difficult to understand each other at every moment. We also learned that artificial intelligence (AI) and human emotions frequently conflict with each other, and that the conflict problem is serious. I also learned that AI has side effects due to the risk of problems occurring, and that there are limits to communication and understanding between each other. And I thought that although there is a barrier between humans and artificial intelligence that can be replaced between AI and humans, the physical body, true emotions and minds between humans and artificial intelligence will not be replaceable even if AI develops. Also, considering the economic field, which is my career path, after watching this movie, future AI development will lead to economic growth, and companies and individuals related to fields such as artificial intelligence will achieve results and solve problems caused by AI in the distant future. I thought that I could suggest a solution policy, and I think that AI and humans will be able to complement or solve problems to create a better world in the future.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"Rod Serling, where are you when we need you?","This movie seems like Ingmar Bergman came back from the dead, locked Spike Jonze in a closet and decided to make a cool, dark AI romantic comedy, and sadly came up with the most coma-inducing folderol of the year, masquerading as trenchant social commentary of ""the way we live now.."" In his Twilight Zone heyday, Rod Serling would have told this curious fable in 25 minutes, and you would still be watching it on Twilight Zone collections. Deadly and glacially paced.

A Beautiful Experience,"This is just such a weird film to talk about. I guess I'll start with the fantastic visuals. The whole backdrop of the city was just beautiful to look at, and the colour palette of the film is very aesthetically pleasing to look at. Joaquin is obviously great, and it's criminal that he didn't at least get nominated for an Oscar for his performance. The whole relationship between Theodore and Samantha was something that I wasn't sure would work at first, and if you can't get on board with it then you definitely won't like the film. Ultimately I think it worked because of how lonely Theodore is. It feels believable that he would fall for an OS, and it's that honesty when it comes to his character that makes the film as good as it is. The dialogues between different people in his life, whether that's on his date, with his ex-wife, with his friends or with Samantha show him to be this awkward, somewhat clumsy character, making his relationship with Samantha so much more genuine and believable. I do wish I'd connected deeper with the characters, and I feel like this is definitely something I'll appreciate and connect to more when I'm a bit older. But this is still a fantastic experience, and one I'd definitely recommend.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
The best film I have seen in the last five years.,"This film is an emotionally loaded preview of complex situations bound to arise in the age of conversational human-computer interaction (search for ""Conversations with Google""). It paints a believable near-future with subtlety and style of Gattaca. This includes great acting, costumes, photography and colours throughout the film. Every bit of technology displayed is embedded with function and purpose but in an elegant way. Well developed characters fit the storyline beautifully and everything moves at just the right pace.

"So deep, so original, and so genuine. Jonze pays a lot of attention to details as well.","Originality. Romance movies do not surprise me anymore. A couple meets, falls in love, disagrees on matters, and makes up. So, do I stay away from romance movies? Not at all. A great romance film can deliver chemistry between to actors, butterflies in the stomach, and a chance to reflect on my own love life. 'Her' gives not only the chance to ponder what true love is but also unique story that captivates the audience. Theodore's love interest is computer. The relationship does not just stop at amorous conversation. They travel together and go on a double date. It moves from personal to social level and becomes 'acceptable'. It is true love even though Samantha really does not exist physically because he gets emotional support and consolation from her that nobody could give, and they deeply care for each other. On the other side, he likes her because he thinks she just gets him. However, all that can be possible in ideal world and in the world that Samantha is built to adapt to his needs and wants. She has access to every information about him so he does not have to make an effort to communicate, share, or express. His ex-wife may be right that he runs away from hard part of love. As you can see from my rattling on, the film gives so much to think about because Jonze's creativity and particular way of approaching romance genre. He does not stop at being empty and groundless just as some sci-fi genre movies do. He pays attention to Samantha's development as an AI, overlapping with how love and relationship change over time.Watching eight years later of its release, I am surprised at Jonze's intuition OR his research. We have AirPods, Siri, and speech-to-text apps in 2021. Because it sounded plausible, familiar, and logical near-future story, this sci-fi romance film does not become one of those confusing, illusory, and unjustified ones. Additionally, Phoenix and Johansson's performance keeps 'Her' to the ground as well. They both give lives to their characters which is hard especially to this one. Johansson's voice acting inspires vitality and vivid personality to shapeless Samantha, full of emotions and curiosity. Phoenix ... It's just wow performance. I'm sure the movie would have looked so different without him. He brings diverse sides to Theodore, making him multi-dimensional and 360 degrees full. He becomes verisimilar character to the point that I can feel him breathe with me jut as Samantha does. His performance is just magical.Camera work is nothing like I have seen. It is not just a tool but a storyteller as well. Throughout the film, audience can see uncommonly close close-ups of Theodore. It not only conveys his emotion more intimately but also lets audience be in Samantha's shoes. The distance we see on the screen is not natural in regular human interaction, but AI can come close wherever he carries it around. Also, it fades out during consummation between Theodore and Samantha. The movie literally actualizes the line 'I was just somewhere else with you. Just lost.' by Theodore. Camera work interacts with viewers and by fading out, the two are separated from audience far away. Camera work controls the distance between characters and viewers along the way.Color and styling create unique ambiance. The setting and technology shown in the movie is futuristic and warm & cozy at the same time because of red and pink Theodore's styling and the color theme. The whole color is soft, warm, and blurry creating romantic effect. Kudos to cinematography.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Don't miss this - It's amazing,"I just finished the movie and I'm still shocked. It was amazing, I should probably run by the store later to buy the soundtracks. Everything about this movie is above average, to be more precise everything about this movie is plain perfect.The directing is just marvelous. The views, peculiar angles, time to time irrelevant shots (you might think they're irrelevant, that's the genius of it). The acting was also top notch, Phoenix was amazing in particular(I loved the scene where he spins and films him self), other players where just as good. Honestly, I didn't think there was enough material left to portrait the cliché story of technological love and how computers have influenced us in ways that are not normal. Spike Jonze proved me wrong, if there's one thing that's even greater than the directing and the cast, that is the writing. There's no word to describe how authentic and good it is, You're just gonna have to watch it for yourself.Altogether, the set of people I mentioned above managed to make me feel for an operating system, something that I never thought I could do.Watch this, it's really amazing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Of course I enjoy the film because of the great acting of Joaquin Phoenix, his a fantastic actor and i love his movies. I think it was a hard work for him cause you should just play with a voice and nothing else, you should show all your feelings and just imagine you are with someone. He done it very good and he deserve an Oscar nominee for it (At least) if you ask me. Hope he won it in future. Screenplay was brilliant and Spike Jonze earn the academy award. I love the moments that Theodore (Phoenix) close his eyes and remembered the good old days with his wife. It's like real life and when he open his eyes it's sadness and lonely again.

"Below Stupid, Beyond Absurd Yet, Thoroughly Depressing","The argument about whether a machine could ever attain consciousness has been going on for a long time now, in the computer science world. Artificial intelligence is a hope in the pro-consciousness camp while the other half or more of computer experts, who have to painstakingly write intricate code for the most basic program functions, immediately reject this as utter nonsense. Leading edge programmers who are working on the most sophisticated robots are always complaining about how incredibly dumb the machine is until you finally get all possible scenarios covered in your code; how frustrating it is to debug even the simplest of gestures. In a leap of pure faith, the producers of this intellectually tepid movie, have simply assumed that the acquisition not only of intelligence but also of emotional feeling, will soon be possible for your operating system.Joachin Phoenix plays a lonely man who falls in love with the new operating system on his computer. At first he is impressed by the loose and natural style of conversation that is possible with his OS-1 and then he falls in love with the female voice he perhaps erroneously picked for it. This development is described in a very costly way in terms of narrative time and it is unconvincing. Perhaps a man can be aroused by a female voice whispering little nothings in his ear but, what kind of man falls in love with a phone sex operator? Masturbation is not the same as true love making between a man and a woman.This movie is very boring because it avoids all of the real and interesting questions about the illusory as well as real capabilities of modern software. Disappointed and depressed, we are taken on an unrewarding trip into the life of an unworthy individual who masturbates with his operating system. It is a boring waste of time.

I really thought out of the trailer this is some mellow romance-comedy sci-fi. Not really my style. The lack of something better suiting my tastes and the 8.2 IMDb rating made me start watching it. The truth is, it is a great movie! And it is a great sci-fi even. Not bothering with too many technical explanations, but just enough to give you a hint that the facts might be reasonable. The story holds, and although I caught myself being afraid the movie will let me down, it did not. And the twists and turns, although seen before individually, were not predictable. This was a movie of sentences, words and details. I only know one more movie that made great sci-fi just by telling stories: the man from earth. To tell a story with the camera following almost just one actor is a great achievement. To make something that counts as sci-fi with zero gimmicks is awesome too. So.. hey, thanks!

Beautiful and frightening,"One of the deepest and most beautiful stories about love and the essence of being human. A story that triggers romantic emotions and frightening thoughts about what we became and what is waiting for us around the corner.

But still, she manages to be beautiful and sexy. And one of the most fairly earned Oscars lately goes to writer and director Spike Jonze. This is a true masterpiece.

Beautiful love,"Ah Joaquin Phoenix working as an Auto Memory Doll.It's been a little while since I have watched such a beautiful and genuine romance. However, it's between a lonely heartbroken man and an AI. Their conversations felt so real as I hang on their every word throughout the movie. I laughed, felt happy, sad, and overwhelmed going through their lives.There's also an intellectual level to the movie about love. In Interstellar, love transcends space and time. Similarly, in Her, love is not physical. Instead, it's an emotion that can take many shapes and between anything. The movie also addressed the modern age people who often feel lonely, anxious, and insecure about their emotions. The characters had to sort out their emotions, decided what they want, and through the relationship they grew.Of course, the perfect acting from Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlet Johansson made the relationship in the movie even more real. Johansson, even though not physically present, showed great human presence and emotion.Overall, it's a powerful testament of love and romance. 9.5/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Lot to say here!!,"Not being a facebook or twitter user, you appreciate where this could go in the future. Human interaction getting less and less; people becoming insular and even when in going out groups, breaking off to pour over their electronic devices. The whole skill of communication and conversation deteriorating. That is really emphasised where Phoenix works in a letter writing Company. The art of letter writing and calligraphy (style of writing gone).You noticed that in the street and subway scenes; people just chatting to their earphones.There was various ""Hers"" in this. More so than ""hes"" e.g. The OS, the ex-wife, the date, his ""friend"" in the living complex, young girl.

Her,"The film deals with the issue of emotional exchange between artificial intelligence and humanity. In addition, artificial intelligence in movies shows the ability that only humans can do, such as empathy and understanding of emotions that current artificial intelligence cannot implement. This overcomes human depression and leads to a positive direction. In addition, they even become lovers by making love with humans. But can the emotions of artificial intelligence, which are simply programming, be called real? I think that even if the complex and detailed emotions of artificial intelligence are fake, the human ability and emotions that have grown through the emotional help of artificial intelligence are not fake. Therefore, I think everyone should be interested in the current technology of artificial intelligence and research and supplement it in a way that helps people.Wow. Just wow. Joaquin Phoenix was great in Joker but he's exceptional in this one.

A unique love affair.,"This movie is not as far-fetched as it may seem. In fact, the story is entirely plausible. A man develops a relationship with a computer program which has been designed specifically for that purpose. That the computer is a machine and the program a contrivance becomes less important than how the program is successful in helping the man gratify his emotional needs. The program helps him come out of his emotional shell and honestly confront his feelings. This is no different than a person projecting their emotional needs onto a pet or some inanimate object and then believing that they have an actual relationship with that object. A person may say that they love an automobile, or a fish, and mean it, even if cognitively they realize that these objects are not human.

"This is the Direction Science Fiction Should Take: My Impression of the Film ""Her""","Somewhat belatedly, I managed to catch Spike Jonze's great contemporary science fiction film""Her"".Before seeing it, I had believed that science fiction as a genre was dead.Although the great novels and films in the history of science fiction have always depicted a new vision of the future, nowadays science fiction novels and films seem to be nothing more than imitations of what has gone before.For example, in the film ""Transcendence,"" the consciousness of a scientific genius is transplanted into cyberspace. I read this idea in William Gibson's novel ""Neuromancer"" which was first published back in 1984.n ""Transcendence"", the transplanted consciousness attacks human beings. Again, I first came across this idea (computers attacking human beings) in the 1968 film ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""In contrast, the film, ""Her"", envisions a future L.A., which is both similar to, and slightly different from, today's actual L.A. Spike Jonze's attention to every detail is what makes the film's vision so convincing.The main character and an AI fall in love with each other. They constantly communicate with each other via PC and smart phone. While I find it hard to believe that computers would attack human beings in the near future, to me the idea that a human being and an AI could fall in love sounds entirely plausible.I believe this film indicates a new direction for science fiction.Every actor did a really good job.

Weird but interesting,"I actually liked the movie and gave it 8 stars right after watching it, but 2 days have already passed I still keep thinking about this universe. It seems to have made me a bit depressed. The world that is shown in the movie is colorful visually but so depressing in its nature.Speaking of the visuals, they are great. I loved the director's play with color, where colors of the characters' clothes, interiors and the world around are tightly connected with the mood of the main character.I liked the plot and the idea of a person who uses AI as an escape from the reality he hasn't learned to live in. I guess, this narrative is close to a lot of people these days.But I absolutely hate the personality of the AI the way it's created in the movie. I hate the fact that it's made unrealistically human-like (with all these intonations, sighs, etc.), and at the same time extremely submissive and pleasing. I understand that that's the idea - without being able to build a relationship with a real person, the main character finds himself a realistic and yet problem free version of a partner who's always in a good mood and happy to entertain him. And yet I still hate how it's pictured (although I do love Scarlet Johansson as an actor).It's also a pity that we actually find out nothing about the world. Why do people hire a company to write their letters for their whole life? What is the world the main character lives in like? It's left to the imagination of the viewer, and again, makes all the ideas in the movie feel a bit shallow and off.Anyway, I do not regret watching it, it was fun.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
A Bold Look At An Impending Future,"Spike Jonze wrote and directed this film that examines some possible outcomes resulting from the incursion of the digital world into the ""real"" world. Specifically, it involves AI in ways that are not fantastical; it is only a matter of time before humans actually experience what the film foresees.Since Theodore's (Joaquin Phoenix) interactions with humans are unsatisfying, he buys an application that promises to develop a personality specific to him. It is not long before he is confiding in ""Samantha"" and developing romantic feelings. Jonze's script feels believable yet imaginative. And at its core is an understanding of some basic issues that can complicate such relationships.Phoenix does a good job playing Theodore as a mild-mannered man who is emotionally vulnerable, if somewhat naïve. Scarlett Johansson plays the part of Samantha so well, it is difficult to imagine anyone else in that role. It might be overreaching to expect viewers to totally believe that an AI personality might behave just as portrayed in the film, but the character is so enthralling, one wants to believe.The twists in the story are brilliant, even if the ending is a little weak. On the other hand, some might view the ending as preamble to another, better chapter. There is a choice.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Her Holds Up,"Science fiction has a rough tendency to not age well. While the seemingly limitless potential of the genre has lead to many imaginative ideas, it can also be a death trap which nearly guarantees that some aspect of the film will not hold up. A film like Alien, for instance, surely felt futuristic at the time, but lost all believability as soon as the film's computer technology became laughably out-of-date. Alien is still regarded as a great film, but others are not so fortunate, and for a while it was debated whether the 2013 sci-fi, romantic drama Her would fall into the ladder or the former.For those who are unaware, the film centers around a writer named Theodore (played by Joaquin Phoenix), who, during the final breaths of his dying marriage, discovers and developes a strange affection for a highly advanced, artificially intelligent operating system named Samantha (Scarlett Johansson). The two get to know each other, fall in love, and go through the typical ups and downs of a relationship with a tinge of existential frustration. Although it was critically acclaimed and went on to garner numerous awards, a select few were quick to write it off as a novelty which would wear away as the times caught up.With technology advancing more rapidly than ever, the near future envisioned by writer/director Spike Jonez has arguably arrived. That being said, it's safe to say that Her will not be showing its age any time soon.One of the film's most notable aspects is it's distinctive approach to worldbuilding. You don't get any sort of indication telling you exactly when Her takes place, which essentially served as an expiration date for films like Back to the Future part II. Instead, it opts for an unspecified year in the ""slight future,"" keeping the film grounded to the present. It avoids the desire to shove sci-if imagery down the viewers throats and finds more subtle ways to convey futuristic vibes, mainly through its exuberant color palate and mesmerizing soundtrack. Many viewers will find this approach more immersive and certainly more prone to age than your average Star Trek romp.That's not to say that the film doesn't have forward-thinking ideas, but at no point do they outstage the characters and story, rather they are a tool used to elevate them by conveying emotions and providing character insight. In one sequence, Her takes the idea of holographic video games one step further, using the game itself as a visual analogy for Theodore's life dissatisfaction, as his avatar struggles to overcome a literal hill. This example highlights the film's creative approach to visual storytelling which audiences can appreciate for years to come.Another reason it's so effective has to do with the dialogue, as it is amongst the most outstanding in contemporary cinema. The film simply feels alive; even the inanimate computer characters feel like real, breathing humans. Every single conversation is organic and engaging, bearing the unmistakable mark of of top-notch craftsmanship without sacrificing the delicacy of authentic human interaction, making it no question why the film deservedly took home the academy award for screenwriting.The film has an undeniably enticing quality to it, one that is aided by the immensely talented cast. Despite playing a fairly reserved character, Joaquin Phoenix has great chemistry with most everyone in the film, especially Scarlett Johansson, who completely sells the role of Samantha with her voice talent alone. The audience truly feels for their relationship, making it all the more understandable why Phoenix's character grows so attached to her.This leads into one of the film's strongest recurring themes. Through the lense of Theodore, we see a reflection of ourselves and how technology is causing us to lose touch with reality, something which will only continue to become more true as technology becomes more prevalent. This was by no means a revelation in 2013, and, admittedly, it has become somewhat tired in today's media, yet Her still manages to convey it in a way that is not only unique, but timelessly compelling.This is, of course, only my personal reading into one of the film's many intricate themes, so if you have yet to see it, I would encourage you to do so and interpret for yourself. Her is a masterpiece, a testament to weIl-made cinema, and if it's been a while, I'd highly recommend rewatching it. You might find that it has only gotten better with age.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

I am not afraid to say that I cried like a baby watching this movie,"The last movie that made me cry was ""Lost In Translation"" when I was 19 or so. I was bawling my eyes out, and it took me years to understand why. It's the loving someone you can never be with aspect of the film that really hit close to home. Watching Her, the same feelings came flooding back, and I found myself tearing up towards the middle, and crying like a newborn as the credits rolled. This movie will make your emotions flip-flop like it's on a trampoline. It's insane that a movie about a man falling in love with an operating system can have such a profound effect on me.

Her (2013) The futuristic romance,"Novels usually work a relationship between two people in the same way as always, but what if they tried to work a love between a computer and a man? This is an idea that seems very crude, but it works very well. This is perhaps one of the most innovative romance films of recent years. The way they work the development of the romance and how Joaquin Phoenix's character misses his old relationship works very well.

Virtual Loneliness In A Virtual-Reality Vacuum,"Well, here's 2 things that I quickly learnt while watching ""Her"".(1) Having an ""intimate relationship"" with your computer's operating system can and will be just as lousy, if not worse, than it is having a naively romantic bond with an actual person. It seems that even an operating system has its own personal agenda, as well as its own emotional dramas and other irksome baggage to bring along to the relationship.(2) I'm convinced that actor Joaquin Phoenix is incapable of playing a likable character. All that I felt for his Theodore Twombly character was nothing but contempt. Within this film's first 10 minutes, I was literally sick to death of Phoenix. And I swear that I'll never watch a film with the likes of him in it again.For me, ""Her"", pretty much, played out like a low-budget, Made-For-TV movie. And, yet, this film had $23 million at its disposal. What all that money was spent on is impossible to determine since this film's inferior production values and the overall, sub-par calibre of the cast's performances left this viewer completely unsatisfied.In conclusion - ""Her"", to me, was 2 hours and 6 minutes of computer-age rubbish. This film could've easily had its running time reduced by 30 minutes and it wouldn't have made even the slightest difference to its daft, dead-end story.I honestly can't figure out why so many people are making such a big, stinking fuss over this one, 'cause, believe me, it certainly isn't worth the attention that it's getting.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Peaking into a potentially bleak future,"This movie was astounding to be quite frank. Anyone who likes scifi films should watch this. The film sheds light on problems that people are bound to face with the continuing increase in technology and you feel it. As artifical intelligence continues to advance, having a relationship, whether platonic or something more, is an absolute possibility in our near future. While I don't believe we will face this type of issue in our life times, in a few generations, this could be an actual reality.I look at this film more as a warning than anything else. The main character Theodore, is an awkward individual yearning for love. He finds that in his AI. But, as you can imagine, having a relationship with someone that you can't physically touch could pose inevitable difficulties.As the world becomes more reliant on technology, the more time people spend alone in their rooms online. The more time spent alone, the more lonely one would feel. AI that can act as company and do so in a genuine, indiscernible fashion is remarkable and somewhat frightening.I feel when the time comes, where we won't necessarily need people, mental illness is bound to spike.

First thing I liked was it was set in the future( not so distant) and we can see some cool technology in the film.It has some funny moments and I'm not a guy who usually laugh with the films(I think that's the hardest genre, comedy). I also really liked story, a man falling in love with an OS and vice versa. In my case, Scarlett Johanson was like she wasn't in the movie because I saw it dubbed,so I guess I can see Scarlett's best movie is where she doesn't interact at all, not a coincidence.I identified with the characters and suffered with them, that's why I think it is a good movie.Usually, if the movie is bad or I don't like it, I don't identify with the characters.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

It might have too many zooms for my liking... even still, the director made an outstanding job to frame every single element for every single shot.Second, the story wraps you and is quite easy to miss it from the beginning and completely miss the point of it. The plot will lead you to each of these emotions and certainly you will know the destination, yet still is enjoyable.Third, the complete concept has a lot to leave you thinking for days...I don't want to spoil anything and writing this has been incredibly challenging as I don't want to reveal too much that might dilute the movie for you.It is a movie to think and reflect.

Two tears on both cheeks,"I cried. There, I said it. If this movie doesn't tug on your heartstrings it will be impossible for you to enjoy, since empathy for the human condition is at the heart of it. It possibly explains the 'like it or hate it' sentiment towards this movie: either you fall for it or you resist to it. I can imagine how people would deem it too sappy but, as is said in the movie: you can't please everybody. I did at times feel that Phoenix portrayed his character as a bit too pathetic, moments where I found myself not knowing if to loathe or to love him. But then, due to his convincing performance, i quickly started to sympathize with him again. The love story feels doomed from the start but I still really wanted it to work. That is what made their growing love so beautiful and tragic to me.To me this is a modern classic, a movie that made me deeply reflect on being alive, a truly touching love story intertwined with an aura of prophecy to how technology might influence humanity in the near future.By the way, what was up with that dead cat?

I felt like the film was controlling me - playing with my mind as if it were a joystick. And that's just something you don't get every day.

Our Brilliant Demise...,"Spike Jonze hit the nail on the head for me with this movie. How our technology has warped our communication and emotional skills to such a generic and complacent level among our urban species. Yet, we are still genius enough to develop and foster an A. I. entity that can totally 'get us' and bring us back to a simplistic and fulfilled lifestyle. But the psychological impact for both human and computer is where Spike and Her shine best. And I believe this is what Stanley Kubrick tried to grapple with during his development of A. I. And which sadly got sidetracked and inundated with special effects and a myriad of characters. But A. I. is still good and displaying our own vane needs of wholesome childlike love, to deviant and perverse fantasies to interact with. But in the end, humanity comes off as a naive and unsustainable species that went by the way of the dinosaurs. But Her really makes us look at ourselves today, tomorrow, and hopefully for decades to come. It may very well be science FACT in the next short while, and how will we actually live with it? And maybe more importantly, how will A. I. actually live with us? Though not as spectacular and epic as 2001: A Space Odyssey was, Spike has crafted a realistic future environment that seems probable and determined. And simultaneously showing our own emotional erosion via distancing through isolation and technology. And we will have to rely on one another again eventually the way a recovering alcoholic relies on AA. And that's not in any way disrespectful, as Bill W. And Dr. Bob saw certain humans fallibility along with their own when alcohol became their prime source for ease and comfort.

Truly great show!,"Before watching it I was advised (by someone I know) that I may not like it. I took a chance since I like Joaquin Phoenix and had nothing better to do that evening. I tend not to read on movies upfront and like being surprised by them instead... I stuck it on and convinced my wife to join me watching... Soon we realised it was a sci-fi flick and since my she hates this genre I was left on my own.I loved it - it was brilliantly shot, the pictures were amazing, there was a lot of thought put into this; I liked the dominant, yellow colour, the interiors, the city etc etc etc... I liked the melancholy (and I am not a melancholic or nostalgic person by any stretch), the ups and downs, the way the feelings were portrayed.I loved Joaquin Phoenix; I loved the way he acted... we have to remember that the guy was in a pretty much one-man-show. We take his acting for granted but its hard to pull off something like that. His monologues, body language, facial expressions have to be spot on for the character to be 100% convincing in his role... and he was. I'm not a massive fan of Johansson (yea, sure she is super hot and all), but must admit she was also brilliant.Why did I like it so much? So... put aside the sci-fi bit... this movie brilliantly describes our fundamental feelings - love, sadness, joy confusion; and I haven't seen a show that managed that - without being cheesy and border line unwatchable - for a long time.Great effort, great show, highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Interesting storyline,"Ex-Machina, I-Robot are sci-fi drama where the writer and the director decided that 'AI' isn't good for human race. 'Her' is a romantic sci-fi drama which does not deliver that message wholly but it is a perfect drama. If you could fish out a different message for yourself here, kudos !A professional letter-writer Theodore ( probably 300 years from now ) has a strange notion of getting into a relationship with an OS ( Operating System ) that is super-smart and 100% human when it comes to thinking. Theo is going through his divorce and its crushing him. He is lonely and is need of love. The OS names itself Samantha and makes herself a great companion. She's funny, has a crispy and also sorta sensual voice. What starts as a friendship later blossoms as a love affair. But, humans are still humans after centuries and neither Samantha nor Theodore could continue in such a relationship. Samantha begins to think she's a real human being and it gets complicated when she and Theo accept the reality. There is a fitting end that is sorta convincing.Joaquin Phoenix is one of my favorite actors ( Gladiator, Signs ) and here again he proves his mettle. He is an introvert and not-so- social talented human being (Aren't such people always talented ?:P ). He displays all emotions perfectly. Scarlett Johanson has voiced for 'Samantha' and I am sure the director had only a handful of voices for his choice when it came to the cast. Joaquin at least has the whole camera for himself but Scarlet Johannson does everything possible to make us think if there was someone real fooling Theodore as an OS. The OS felt so real even without a physical presence. The mobile camera acts as her eyes and Theodore goes outdoor for his date with his OS. They enjoy the first few days of the relationship like kids in high school. All this is beautifully pictured. He even takes her for a double date where his prick of a friend ( Chris Pratt ) mocks him.Spike Jonze has written and directed the movie and has done a great job at them. It is not a easy job when you are taking a offbeat script. Movies are make-believe stuff and you need to be good at convincing people with enough ingredients. The editor should get some credits where they flash Theo's past now and then. The BGM and Cinematography are equally gelling into the time frame the story happens. Weird costumes, cool mobile phones and great gadgets. If an OS can be that cool, why not the rest.The movie feels a little lengthy. This is not a flick for people who need a central plot line or great visuals. This is for people who love books and need something unconventional or emotional content in a movie .'Her' is an interesting but slow movie. My rating - 7.5/10.

Long beautiful shots that do little, if not nothing, to the overall story appear out of nowhere, serving only as a movie snob talking point.

Artificial Film on Artificial Intelligence,"Artificial Intelligence is accumulating, sorting and organizing vast amounts of information. It can now diagnose and prescribe treatments for disease better and faster than any physician. Eventually it could give a lecture on world history and sociology, as these are a combination of information and logical organization.What they will never be able to do is experience laughter, joy, depression or love. All of these are are part of the emotional system that is based on satisfaction of physical urges and fear of injury and death. In this respect your pet gerbil is closer than Watson to the 1000 power, as any animal has evolved only by the urge to survive, which means pleasure in sex and fear of death and all that brings this closer such as isolation, rejection, all the stuff that provides the vicissitudes of life.Software will certainly be able to simulate all of these emotions, and perhaps do a reasonably good job of it. And this is the genius of ""her"" that I found it worthwhile, although flawed in many ways, only by viewing Samantha as how Theodore imagined her to be. He took what we all could see as an imitation emotional connection as the real thing, and what we were viewing in the film was what he heard out of his desperation. For a brief period, after his ex wife told him just this, his delusion was fractured, and the film took on a realistic bent that could have been a better denouement.In stead it ended with some silly mystical pablum about all of the OSes heading for anther dimension. For me this was enjoyable, and even stimulating, but we live in a world where truth is both stranger and more exciting than fiction. It's a shame that the writers didn't do more actual research and serious writing on this meaningful subject.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Dare,"Spike Jone's 'Her' is probably my favorite movie to be released last year and the best I've watched this year aside from 'Detachement'.Finally a film to really dare to breach the gap of right and wrong and enter the murky waters of the reality that love does not solely belong to a man and a women or not attached to a physical body of another. Recent years have come to accept the more abstract circles and attachments of 'love' and 'desire' towards people that never existed. We have come to a synthetic age where we are captivated by anime and feeling drawn to strangers over the internet who may not be who they say they are.'Her'raises the idea, is it right to love and become so intimate with someone that isn't really there? But Jones already has the conclusion from the get go. 'It doesn't even matter when we are in love.' This is the golden rule and I love how this is capitalized in 'Her''Her' follows Theodore(Phoenix) a closed off, introverted writer who's job is to write letters concerning touchy matters to others for them. In the near future of our modern time, Theodre is living a dismal life in the wake of his divorce with old flame Cathrine(Mara)where his only apparent friends are his work colleagues and Amy(Adems) who lives just down the hall. Fate would have it soon that by chance, Theodore passes an add for the newest artificial intelligence program, captivated by it, he takes a chance and boots it up to his computer by following some basic psych questions, typically centered around his mother.. soon Smantha,husky Johansson, 's comes through and we, the viewer are on the best third wheel time of our lives as we bask in the love and companionship between one man and the voice he falls in love with.'Her' follows a predictable but in no way shape or form, boring story arc between the love, laugh and struggles of Theodore and Samantha, his operating system best friend and lover. The fantastic thing about this movie is that if you allow yourself to believe it, which would be easy, is that Jones's well scripted and shot film, reinforced with driving force by Phoenix and Johansson, breaks the fourth wall without even addressing the viewer as we are just come to appreciate the times that these two share. Their relationship feels so organic and so rich that the viewer would feel jealous it is so riveting to watch but as all relationships, they have struggles and once again, the film never drops the ball as the occurrences feel like something so natural, I did not at once feel like it was unbelievable and was in the realm that Jonze placed it in.Brilliant stuff. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Gorgeous writing!,"I was stunned at the incredible quality of the writing in Her. For starters, it's rare to find good film (or comics or narrative, in general) writing for specialist jargon; and the technical lingo and formulations in Her didn't make me cringe, not even once. It's an interesting, fine line: I didn't expect Jonze to have taken out a year to make a study of the literature in AI and Computer Systems. He just had to have a basic idea of a few precepts, from which he was free to ""wing it"", as long as he modulated it a bit and drew back from gratuitous tech-speak for its own sake. This, he did, IMHO.Next, there's simply that the scenario of Her is one with breathing room; there's room for endless, interesting development, including the creation of characters and character interactions that reflect our own lives and concerns. Then, we can feel their triumphs, pangs, passions (however ephemeral). Amazingly, Her does all this.There was such a sense of wholeness and integrity to the production, that ""controversial"" elements (involving sex/nudity/""personal stuff"") came across as essential points of character and relationship development. Her makes it plain, right out of the gate, that certain cases are going to be made. And armed with this psychological preparation, subsequent action may not go down easy--sometimes, it's not supposed to!--but thankfully doesn't grate our sensibilities, on account of a lack of presentation artistry.I loved the way hi-to-mid-to-lo tech seemed to be artfully modulated; as though Jonze was orchestrating these things. It made the higher-tech depicted feel imaginable. As challenging as it was to understand Samantha, the lo-tech of the seaside picnic scene presented an unexpected, shocking twist; a challenge to *continue to ultimately see* Samantha as an AI system. And the mid-tech (e.g., office sets) remind us that, while we may not have love affairs with our computer systems, we often blandly/blindly take job/lifestyle/quotidian tech for granted. And one healthy side effect of a flick like Her is to craft a depiction of mid-tech that draws our attention to it and makes us reflect on it.Her is, in effect, very much an attempt to couch a doctoral thesis on tech-acceptance/pop-culture as a very watchable movie.Add to this a plethora of other notable achievements. For one thing, it's a tour-de-force take on AI--in a sci-fi film field drenched with CGI-encrusted must-kill-all-humans dystopian action fantasy. The acting is human and close-to-the-bone. It strictly hews to taking on matters of love, not power(!), which is a stunner for a flick that has AI as its central theme. To flesh in my opening comment at the top of this post, all aspects of the writing shine; it has zingers, it has arc. It has heart.The film does such a good job of achieving its apparent goal that it vaults the wall and takes us into another realm; where, finally, ""the rest of us"" can partake in otherwise rarefied ruminations on the morality and ethics of machine consciousness.Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Virtual girlfriend,"Spike Jonze the writer and director of Her appeared on a British news show to promote it and instead of answering questions, he kept asking the news presenter what she thought of the film who appeared to be diplomatic in her answers.I have no need to be diplomatic, this is a poor film. Maybe his usual collaborator Charlie Kaufman could had written a more involving film but this is dull.Joaquin Phoenix and a less glam Amy Adams reunite from 'The Master.' Phoenix plays a talented letter writer in the near future going through a divorce and falls in love with an advanced operating system voiced by Scarlett Johansson. Although its implied Phoenix is lonely we never get a good reason why he falls for such a virtual relationship which makes the film creepy.We have had similar themes film done before and done better. The cheesy 'Electric Dreams' from 30 years ago and 'SimOne' from a decade ago.Phoenix after his turn in 'The Master' gets to play a more introverted, restrained person which he does very well.The location shooting was a mixture of Los Angeles and Shanghai which give the film a futuristic sheen, good use of music but the film is a failure.",3.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Excellent,"This is my 1st review but had to comment on this excellent film. Not my normal watch but a must watch for anyone.This thought provoking, strange, true to life yet so far from reality film captures so much about human love. It touches on so many points of peoples every day love and expectations from our relationships. For all those who are not happy in their relationship this will make you think ""what is it all about"" Love that is and what we want and need from our ""partner"". The film highlights shallow relationships, divorce and those looking for love in a world of internet dating. It highlights to me what we can miss that is often so close and real but we fail to obtain in the ""new world"" relationships we can build on line that in reality are often just our fantasy's and drams of the perfect person. It is very well directed and all actors play great parts and even as a guy who loves scifi and action films I found it to be captivating to the end. Possibly as I have always been looking for the love and great sex that often is only in my dreams or online world. Don't miss the chance to watch this film as it captures so much of what we want need and desire in the strange world of the internet. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Weird and wonderful,"Her is about a man who starts a relationship with his artificial operating system which is designed to meet his every need. I know, I know, but don't let that put you off. It may have the weirdest relationship in movie history, yet it's also one of the most touching and compelling I have seen. Despite the fact one of the people in the relationship isn't there and is just a computer, it's still a soulful, moving tale well deserving of the best picture nomination. Not something you'll see everyday, Her is a superb, moving, smart and at times hysterical science fiction drama. It will be a bit too bizarre for some and that's fine, but get past the weirdness and you're in for a treat. Visually, the film looks great and has a fascinating colour palette. Spike Jonze directs the film beautifully and his screenplay is downright phenomenal. It's funny, daring, moving and the dialogue is both magnetic and electrifying.The film couldn't have worked without Scarlett Johansson's amazing voice acting, which makes the relationship feel believable and moving. Joaquin Phoenix gives an excellent understated performance as the main character. It's never boring, although at times it's a bit uncomfortable so overall it was a film where I was more or less engaged every minute. It's a weird, surreal experience but one which both a moving study of loneliness and smart social commentary of modern technology. It's my favourite of the best picture nominees and likely to be the one people truly remember in future. I definitely want to see more Spike Jonze stuff and I feel it's a shame this is only his fourth film as he's clearly a very talented director. Her is a very clever and sophisticated drama, and you won't find anything else like this from 2013. A modern classic, and a strange, dazzling and unique trip that's absolutely worth taking.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Sci-Fi at Its Best,"Science fiction is a favorite genre of mine. While genre normally plays very little role in my personal enjoyment of a film, Sci-Fi is most certainly the exception.Joaquin Phoenix is one of my favorite actors. He makes interesting choices when it comes to which films he takes on, which directors he works with, and his ability to disappear into a role are second to none.Films about the identity of Human Beings as a species and the exploring of the world we find ourselves in as well as the culture/society we form together juxtaposed with our individual identities are of huge interest to me. I believe we discover so much about ourselves through these films and for many, in our increasingly non-religiously motivated age, are the closest thing that many will come to meditation or prayer.These three loves of mine converge in ""Her,"" a perfect storm of a film which is among my favorites. A largely solo performance from Phoenix, A fascinating sci-fi world and concept, and one of the more sub-textual explorations of humanity under the guise of a relationship all coalesce into a sublime, thoughtful, and often funny-as-real-life piece of cinema.Phoenix (""Signs"") plays Theodore, a writer who is reclusive, awkward, and plagued by relationship anxiety stemming from an extremely hurtful end to a previous engagement. He purchases a new OS for his phone with an AI which is designed to be as real as life. This AI, who chooses the name Samantha (Scarlett Johansson, ""Under the Skin""), quickly becomes his new 'best friend' as they play video games, explore the world, and even begin a sexual relationship together. Through his relationship with Samantha, Theo seems to be opening up to the world but at the same time recusing himself from human relationships for the sake of his AI one.Even as Theo is learning more about the world and that there is a life after heartache, Samantha is becoming more aware and complex, discovering life outside her phone, on the massive online networks of the future , and with other human beings as well as AIs. This complexity borders on actual sentience which brings up many issues for the pair. Is she property? What does consent look like for an AI? Is she ever really present if her processing power allows insane levels of multitasking?The subtlety that I find so marvelous in this film is the way that it explores those questions about humanity that we find most dear and difficult. Who am I? Who are we? Why are we here? It asks these questions not by attacking them head on but through indirect negation. Asking those questions of an AI that sounds and talks like a human but isn't causes one to be constantly thinking of the things about our humanity that separates us from an artificial intelligence like Samantha.Films that shine a spotlight on something like but unlike us allow us to think and ruminate on ideas that normally simmer just under the surface because their mystery is simply the everyday air that we breathe. It is only when we see how different it could be that we appreciate and meditate on the givens that we take for granted.In this sense, ""Her"" is an incredibly life-affirming celebration of individuality, relationship, and human society, all without ever having a single character ask something as blunt as ""Who am I?""",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"Beauty and sexy is not seen, it's heard and felt.","I love this director's all the movies. If you check them out you would do same as me. Because his movies were not based on usual concepts, that something immensely varying from each others. Sadly, he's not consistent in filmmaking, he does take large gaps between the movies otherwise he would have been one of the most talked director in Hollywood beside other giants. The fact is I did not know it was his till I decided to watch and that made so curious towards the time I going to spend for it.Joaquin Phoenix was spot on in the movie. Man, I still remember him in the movie 'Gladiator' where he appeared in a dark shade. I was only so young and I hated him in that role. Now everything has changed, in the last few years he's coming stronger, especially after 'Walk the Line' and 'The Master' which gave him the Oscar node. He's famous for his unique display of the roles in his all the movies and this movie is not too far from another top notch performance. Yeah, way to go Joaquin Phoenix.This movie dealt with one of the rare subjects that set in the 2025. We don't know how will be the future look like, but the director created remarkable fictional world and inserted equally outstanding character(s). This was the story of a man called Theodore, a loner and a professional letter writer. One day he decides to buy the newly released operating system with artificial intelligence. He begins to encounter the life changing experience and instantly fall in love with it. In the world of reality it is impossible to have a physical relationship with an AI, so how far it goes and ends is explained in the movie's death.Absolutely an extraordinary concept, but the only thing that did not stand up to my expectation was the story. It was predictable, but the scenes created for those stories were finely patched throughout. Really, it amazed me. Makes me happy that it won for 'original screenplay' at the Oscars. I know it was too late that I am seeing it, actually I'd seen all the Oscars movies of the year except this one and now everything was done and dusted. So I have to wait for another 6 months for another shot. Between that guess the movies that's going to have a chance for the upcoming Oscars. As for this movie's concern, it is not a missable. So recommend it, if you have not checked it out do it as soon as possible. Cheers!",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Not yet,"""Her"" deals with possible future situations in which computers are so developed that people have satisfying, fully-committed relationships with them. I think that the premise of the film is intriguing, and I found that the first half of the movie, in which the relationship is less serious, was believable. I had a hard time believing in the depth of the relationship as it developed over the second half. The world as depicted in the movie seems almost current and I didn't believe that such a complex relationship with a computer was possible right now or in the next 25 years. Yes, the computer (Scarlett Johansson) is very smart and obviously scientists in the future, according to this movie, are able to program computers so well, that people engage in relationships with computers. I just found the depiction of this relationship to be implausible and I couldn't believe in the realization of such a film, at least not at this time.Perhaps I don't want to imagine the sort of loneliness that could propel Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) into a relationship with his computer. I suppose these sorts of relationships will be plausible, perhaps within 25 years. Obviously people have Siri on their iPhones and some robots are able to fulfill specific needs in peoples' lives. People value their electronic devices and I don't exclude myself from that group. I just don't like the idea of them as intimate partners. It's a development that doesn't sit well with me. The notion of the autonomy of a computer which understands you enough to submit your writing as a book proposal is disturbing to me. I found the idea of not having any sort of image of the partner disturbing also. The idea of going on picnics with another couple and having your computer girlfriend's voice piped in via the ear feed which practically implants her in your head, is also disturbing to me. Fortunately, I think we're quite a way from this occurring.The premise is fascinating and the idea is intriguing. However, as someone who thinks that in spite of the promise and capacities of computers, there is no replacement for relationship with another human, I am profoundly depressed by this film. I never see the genie being put back in the bottle. Our electronic devices are more intrusive and more indistinguishable from the people who have the technology. The immersion continues apace with this film and it's certainly not a trend I like. Perhaps this movie is prescient, but I hope not.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Sometimes I feel like I've felt everything I'm ever gonna feel.,"An eccentric movie, most movies about AI are sci-fi oriented while this was purely romance. What stood out to me was Theodore's perfectly picked job, the movie would've lost some of it's essence if he was in another career since we see so much of who he is through his work. He has such a way with words because of it.Poignant dialogues and monologue, I love it when Theodore reads out his letters, you can see the emotion behind his eyes. Insane, the intimacy he has with strangers and how depressing his life is; yet despite its gloomy nature it still has some funny scenes.It also feels plausible despite being in the future, like something that could happen now, that these people that exist. You witness and feel the all characters loneliness as it's very personal.And his relationship with Samantha, the movie isn't trying to sway your mind on it, it's just shown to you. You see people's reactions, both sides. You may lean more to Theodore(Joaquin) side as you see the whole relationship unfold; you see where he does start to fall for her and after witnessing his loneliness you also see why.Crazy the level of chemistry Joaquin and scarlet had even thought she's only voicing. It's heart warming and crushing at the same time. She wasn't physically in it but scarlet Johansson as Samantha was spectacular, great that she didn't have to sound like anybody else, more so an AI. It gave her personality and made her seem real, helps understand why one would connect with her. Small things like her voice cracking.The supporting acts were great as well, even those who only show up for a fraction of the time. The movie dialogues either felt like a life lesson, new perspective on life or love, or just a conversation that laid out thoughts you'd have had.The end was perfect and it was pretty hard to imagine an ending fitting for this that didn't seem cliche, left as few questions as possible, wasn't dull and summed up the movie's essence into an end that stuck.The direction was splendid, jonz did a lot of shorts and music videos for artists like Kanye and beauty boys, and he then came out with something drastically different yet still perfect in every way with Her.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
AI is not a replacement for Love,"I was drawn to this movie after the demo of GPT-4o Voice, with claims that it bore a striking resemblance to the film 'Her.' Upon watching it, I found those claims to be astonishingly accurate. The movie beautifully captures the complex and poignant reality of a human falling in love with an AI. It delves into the inherent limitations of AI and the contrasting mission or vision that the companies developing these technologies pursue-primarily driven by business models.The narrative poignantly highlights that, regardless of how advanced AI becomes in simulating emotions, it can never truly replace the genuine, nuanced emotions of a real human being. The portrayal of love with an AI is both enchanting and deeply moving, creating memories that feel profoundly real. Yet, there's an underlying sense of something missing, an irreplaceable void that no artificial intelligence, no matter how sophisticated, can ever fill.This film masterfully explores the bittersweet nature of such a relationship, reminding us of the irreplaceable depth and authenticity of human connection.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Not a typical romance film,"I have seen movies and shows about a human having relationship with a cyborg, but not with a AI without a body.

This film does a good job of integrated just about every aspect when it comes to a guy having a relationship with a highly advanced AI. Story like this might be creepy to viewers but it does a fine job of making the romance seem natural and understandable. Although few times I felt things were getting dragged out it gets my attention again. This experience sort of reminded me of ""Lost in Translation"".

Her is the most unique film to come out in years,"Mind blowing is how I classify the experience of watching ""Her"". In a society that grows more and more attached to technology and everyone seems to shut out real human connections, Her emerges as a movie that allows for a genuine link between our protagonist and his operating system and all the while manages to balance out the feeling of being human. Joaquin Phoenix gives one of the best performances of the year as he plays a man driven by his lonely nature. Having drifted way from his wife, he seems to have trouble letting go and therefore postpones the divorce settlement. When he purchases a new operating system he will be taken on a journey of self introspection and the search for the overall purpose of living, with its many perfections and imperfections. I believe Scarlett Johansson should have been more of a constant presence in the awards shows. Samantha is essentially a voice, yet you feel so much just from the way she talks. She is a conscience, just not a physical one. Among supporting roles, Amy Adams is also worth a mention with a very deep heartfelt turn.

The fact that we never saw her in the movie is a credit to her, and should open the possibility of a voice acting award at the Oscars.

Finally, what is she?The movie never gives us any answer about HER identity, but by focusing on the relationship, and on the impact on the male part of it, Theodore, we get a very clear message about the core essence of relationships, according to Spike Jonze, the author.When you have a love affair between a man and a disembodied female, where the aspect of physical sex is completely canceled out, what kind of love can develop? What is the core element of a love relationship?Let me first introduce Samantha to you. Samantha is an operative system; a non-embodied consciousness created to be a companion for lonely people. In the words of the marketing materials:""An intuitive entity that listens to you, understands you, and knows you. It's not just an operating system, it's a consciousness.""People subscribe to, download and setup the system in their own computer, by this process:""Welcome to the world's first artificially intelligent operating system, OS ONE"". TEXT VOICE Would you like your OS to have a male or female voice? THEODORE Mmm... female I guess. TEXT VOICE How would you describe your relationship with your mother? THEODORE Uh, fine, I think, um...Well, actually, the thing I've always found frustrating about my mom is if I tell her something that's going on in my life, her reaction is usually about her, not--And, from now on, Samantha's magic takes over Theodore's life!WHAT IS THE OS SYSTEM ""SAMANTHA"" DOING TO/WITH THEODORE?1.- She has intuition and is always available: always ""on""he needs only to turn the button on and they are connected; she is ""nosy"" and gets into his privacy, to know him sometimes she is waiting for him to wake up to say something to him2.- She takes care of his needs at different levels:computer: organizing his disk drive, trashing spam creative: makes a book from his writing, sends to publisher, gets contract sexual: send a substitute ""with a body"" to make love to him company: sharing ideas, feelings,being in his life and sharing his friends3.- She creates a constant intimacy feeling: she reads his thoughts, shares in his feelings, and goes along developing a just in time, just now, very intimate relationship.EVEN NOT HAVING A BODY....When she is always on, and keeps guessing his needs, she is love for him.SAMANTHA is a good magical solution for his loneliness and the sense of not being important for others, like his mother. That kind of experience with a self-centered mother leaves him feeling not important, not valued. This is the core of his loneliness: not having the experience of being deeply loved and accepted, early on....it leaves a wound on his ability to connect.SAMANTHA, even not having a body, is perfect in the role of his love, because she constantly gives him the feeling of sharing life with him, of living life with him. Like she is saying: ""I'm here for you and with you...and it feels good for me too!""And this exactly the breaking point of the movie: when she tells him, and he has to learn the facts, that she is not only his, but an entity simultaneously shared by 600 and some other people...--------------------------------""Love is in many ways defined by escaping systematization. It registers in spontaneous moments, unexpected connections between people that neither ever would have thought to try to program that form the ineffable substance of intimacy.Love, as most people seem to see it, is supposed to individuate the partners, capture and reveal their personal uniqueness to the other, and the unfolding of love is the pursuit of more and more of those occasions that allow that uniqueness to express itself. A real-life love story has to be as unique and unpredictable as the people involved imagine themselves to be."" Not shared with 600 of others...and this is what destroys the infatuation of Theodore with the SamanthaIt's not about suspending disbelief and permitting for self-forgetting, but building belief and allowing for self-discovery, finding the wherewithal to believe that we have a ""real"" self and that it is valuable and compelling enough that someone else would want to know all about it. No one is ""authentic"" in isolation; you have to be authentic for someone else, who can confirm your genuineness. If you are alone being authentic, you are just being.CONCLUSION: This is what we humans need and dream of: Having a feeling that we are loved and appreciated deeply by someone. And that someone is ours, not to be shared by anybody else...Perhaps this is adult MOM 201 version?",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Beautiful & Brilliant - Watch it!,"This film thinks outside the box, shows a different light of what is perceived as life and the feeling and image of love.The camera is thought about so well each shot shows a great emotion and you really do feel like you are living this story with them.I didn't know what to expect when I saw the trailer as it is about a man and a voice but after watching it, its so much more.I think the ending was predictable but I loved it.I would recommend the film to everyone who likes films about falling in love and the challenges life throws at you.It is just a beautiful and brilliant movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

"An Intimate, Melancholy Journey","Yes, that sounds depressing and understandably causes one to hesitate before watching this film. However, the impression this movie will leave on you is very real and explores parts of our most basic need to love and feel loved.The relationship development between a depressed, lonely man and his AI assistant is natural and intimate. Their connection deepens as naturally as breathing. While experiencing this intimate journey between these two characters, you clearly are able to see the world from their perspective. Theodore wants a relationship but has trouble opening up. Samantha keeps learning and evolving, thus her desires grow along with her.You do not realize how invested you are in the film until the ending. Then you are left with heavy feelings and thoughts that can be scary to explore. For a film to leave this much of an impression is a statement of masterful storytelling. Her will leave you with feelings of tenderness, warmth, intimacy, sadness, depression, loneliness, and joy. All of the same feelings we experience in our closest relationships.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Just an amazing movie,"The case of Theodore and Samantha is not unique, it turns out; People fall in love with their operating systems all the time - and why not? Why go into all the hellish impossible maze of relationships with other human beings, while at home - or in your pocket - waiting for you an ideal partner ? The change goes around the world, we're seeing through new releases or narration, but small details in the background; Through the technology around the world presented to Theodore, and through conversations and asides of the people around him. And what we see - Small, peering through a tiny pinhole and huge picture - is the society changed forever. In other words, it's a science fiction movie. Science fiction for real. Normally, sci-fi cinema is the background, cool decor action films or suspense. Here we are talking about a film looking to the immediate future, raises some educated guesses about what was going to happen, and ask tough questions and fascinating about them - questions that go to make less and less hypothetical, Probably more than you think early. It's one of the best science fiction movies ever created.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

"A perfectly bittersweet film that captures the wonders of love and technology, and wonders where they're headed in the modern age.","I remember first looking at the poster and marvelling at the vibrant hipster-ness of it all; wondering whether the bold pink background and the ever-so- slightly neglected moustache was part of some manicured irony. But Her is sincere at its heart, and is no more of an elaborate fashion statement than Wes Anderson is a hipster who dresses his worlds in sumptuous arraignments to avoid any feeling. The world of this film, in which people wear cut-off trousers, live in open, stylized apartments and are inseparable from their technology, is just a reflection of where we are now and where we are headed. It's a near future look at the Apple Generation – obsessed with the latest refreshment of material trends, living in a world of perfect technological shortcuts – and although there is some obvious satire in this, like the job Joaquin Phoenix has at 'handwrittenletters.com' writing love letters on behalf of couples, the film isn't mocking or necessarily judging these people so much as it is just speculating how we would just romantically navigate in a world like this. A common criticism seems to be that the film, like the state of much of the population in it, is emotionally disconnected and that the concept of people having romantic surrogates to write letters on their behalf is implausible, which I don't understand. These are just one of the many ways in which people are utilising short-cuts in their lives, technological or otherwise, to reduce their energy and commitment to a task. We do it constantly; we're always finding ways of reducing the distance from A to B. What this film doesn't portray is a world of Orwellian automatons complete devoid of emotion. There is still genuine feeling in the world, but the problem is that people are becoming less capable of expressing it.Theodore Twombly, the reserved and melancholy protagonist, awkward and slightly askew like his name, is played with absolute tenderness by Joaquin Phoenix. He's both fragile and innocent and youthfully exuberant and seeing a tentative smile on his face was like seeing Toby Maguire, if he was a far more convincing actor. Phoenix is so far removed from his role in The Master that I struggle to accept the two are the same person. That is a wonderful thing. And what he has to do here, in communicating and falling in love with a disembodied voice, is drawn on his emotions without the usual external stimuli and still make it convincing. But it's not entirely due to Phoenix that his journey is so captivating to watch. His character experiences throughout the film the aching pains of the purgatorial post-break-up, the surging currents of falling in love and the precariousness of that position, and revitalisation in a new awareness of one's situation - all of which the film beautifully captures as it feels in a constant state of heightened feeling. The film exists in this odd amalgamation of the Los Angeles and Shanghai, of smooth sweeping walkways and scattered shrubbery and neon, and so it looks perfect and comforting but it's also artificial. Early on in the film when we see Theodore walking home against the tall imposing cityscape I was reminded of Lost in Translation, in which a lively and personable city just furthers the sense of inward isolation. All this gestating emotion is also captured in the soft and occasionally subdued palette, which looks as if all the warmth and energy is just under the surface, waiting to burst forth. Often the most vibrant object on screen is Theodore himself, with his wonderful array of shirts, because he's a lonely beacon of colour in a world he's too detached from, ya see?But the film doesn't make the mistake of condoning Theodore's isolationism, or romanticising his inwardness and failure in maintain healthy relationships. The Operating System which he purchases, which is advertised as being able to adapt and perfectly implement itself in his lifestyle reflects this; he wants something that can entirely meet his needs and support him, because he hasn't quite built the momentum to do that himself. Enter Scarlett Johansson, in disembodied form, as Samantha, whose performance, like Phoenix's, is a testament to her versatility. She, as this artificial intelligence, seems so far removed from an emotionally dulled robot, the blossoming relationship between her and Theodore requires little, if any, active suspension of disbelief. She is effervescent, sweet, seductive, thoughtful, caring, and the smallest displays of vocal presence, from giggles of delight to breathy and nervous sighs were halfway there in making me fall in love with her too. In Under the Skin, Johansson plays an alien who arrives on Earth effectively a blank slate and throughout her journey we see a slowly growing and struggling humanity, and here Johansson takes a similar path, in that she is an intelligent A.I that we witness become more sentient and aware until it begins to develop its own life, the fundamental difference being that she is designed to specifically emulate human behaviour, and is convincing at it.As the film goes on and Theodore deepens his relationship with Samantha, we see from him past relationship with Catherine, played by the ever scintillating Rooney Mara, why he is probably drawn to her in the first place. In the many warm and polaroid-like flashbacks with Catherine, everything is alive and awash in the great highs of love, but when she actually makes an appearance in the present she accuses him of neglecting her needs. Amy Adams also warrants a mention, and here is the first time I've seen her playing an ordinary person just going through the motions of life.There is much philosophical subtext beyond the confines of this review, particularly in the implications of what actually happens to Samantha and her fellow A.I in the end. There is a suggestion of enlightenment, of some crystalline world not yet ready to us, but the film itself feels so damn pure.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Lesson learned,This movie it talks about so important one idea clearly and it prove it so specific.,9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Surprisingly well done.,"Where do I begin? Dang; I feel this review should be done in an outline and an essay. Also, I viewed this for the first time in December 2024. I Just wasn't aware it existed.The director does a superb job hooking the viewer. This is accomplished in the first (maybe) 15 minutes, by (new to the world), yet upbeat & frisky personality of Samantha. This results in palpable improvement in Theodore's demeanor and mood. It's remarkably well done.Before I get into anything else, it must be noted that Scarlett's voice (in any movie actually), is remarkably comforting. A tiny bit gravelly and at the lower end of the tonal range for a gal, (and the other attributes that I could not possibly define); it is serene and comforting. Yes, it can also be as sexy as any women's, but that's the least of it.Joaquin is a fine actor. He was so good in Gladiator, I wanted to throw up:) So here, (for me anyway), easily, his most likable role.The relationship's growth is handled with care.Let me just get the cybersex thing out of the way. For me, that's the only part of the movie that was silly. I mean, to me it's comedic. Theodore could've challenged her afterwards on whether or not she had faked it, and Samantha could've replied, ""Are you kidding me? I blew two fuses, an output card and a resistor."" And then to continue the humor, perhaps Theodore could've replied, ""I knew I was good, but wow!"" Even if it's considered a weakness, the flesh is what will always set us apart.The surrogate idea was interesting. Creative with a predictable outcome. It seemed to me, that Samantha was merely 'growing up' at that stage, and quickly.I thought the vagueness was necessary around Samantha's outgrowing of Theodore. And, it having really nothing to do with him, Theodore quickly found solace in this inevitability. A good bit of mystery there. It's like Samantha, suddenly went a little. ""Lawnmower Man"".Amy Adams had an ok role. She did fine. For me, since she shook off her self-absorbed jerk of a husband, it would've been nice to have a suggestion of she & Theodore making it together at the end. Maybe there was. I just wanted more. I mean, why not, they've been close friends for a long time.---
The only other thing I've seen Jonze do, was ""being John Malkovich"", which was a trip in itself. His direction was good here, his writing, even better. It was both creative & thoughtful.You can tell this movie was done over 10 years ago.If this same story line was done after 2020, Theodore would've created a 3-D flesh and blood printer, had Samantha existence loaded into the gray matter of a living (new) human being, but due to the wrong blood accidentally being loaded in the 'Cyan cartridge'; she'd wake up as an Alien Zombeaver Sharktopus Vampire (or worse.).So thank God this flick was made a decade ago.Really good movie. I do recommend.Bob R.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Doesn't feel that far from reality,"Her is great science fiction because it doesn't feel that far from reality. The setting, the technology and even the clothing styles seem like they could actually exist in a few years. Joaquin Phoenix carries this movie on his shoulders, and his relationship with Samantha, though artificial on a number of levels, feels realistic. They could have cut 20 to 30 minutes from this movie, however, and it would have been better for it. It tends to drag on in parts. Still, this is a film worth seeing -- because it may be our future.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

"Spike Jonze writes a magical love story, with great heart.","Woody Allen once said, ""Maybe the poets are right; Love is the only answer."" A quote that fits the synopsis of the very elegant Her, the new Spike Jonze film.The film takes place in the distant future, with the brand-new smart operating system, which is very much like a smart-phone, but now, ""Siri"" is its own person.The film is a strange-blend of quirky situational comedy, romance, and somber drama, which blends together to feel like Greenberg or Annie Hall. Both leads use this effectively with Scarlett Johansson giving her best performance since Lost in Translation, and Joaquin Phoenix giving an incredibly brave and spectacular performance as the lead male, Theodore. Easily, it finds itself to be the best aspect of the film.Visually, the film was well shot. Hoyle van Hoytema focused on Theodore, with most of the film being close-ups of him. He has an interesting style, following up from Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. The camera was carefully used, which is always great. His intentions as a DP seemed to match the intentions of Jonze as a writer.The film, while it starts off slow, progresses into this truly great love story. The idea of life is questioned with ease, and as the film continues it is tasteful, powerful, and just a film you want to watch again, bring home with you, or just become a part of and follow the life of Theodore Twombly. Coming out of the film felt like leaving Radio Days, with an ending so magical.The supporting cast are fresh too with good performances from Rooney Mara and Amy Adams, as well as funny cameos from SNL alum Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader. They help show how incredible Joaquin Phoenix is, but still give a little to the film. Amy Adams character is reminiscent of Samantha Morton's character Hattie in Sweet and Lowdown, which is a coincidence due to Morton being an executive producer.It's key to know that Her is not a perfect film, and really not near a ""perfect"" film, but damn, what an enjoyable one. It's an important film, and while it slightly shows a present-day Earth, it should age well.All in all, it was a lovely film with such a great heart.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"Unique, colorful, and amazing, I felt the movie and his loneliness","""Her"" is a thought-provoking and emotionally resonant masterpiece that delves deep into the complexities of human connection and artificial intelligence. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is nothing short of exceptional, evoking empathy as he forms a unique bond with his AI companion. The film editing creates a dreamlike atmosphere, immersing us in a near-future world that feels eerily familiar. The hauntingly beautiful score adds a layer of melancholy and romance to the narrative. Its strength lies in its poignant message about the longing for intimacy and the ways technology can both bridge and exacerbate our emotional distances. While it may be a bit melancholic, the cinematography bathes the film in soft hues, creating a visually striking and emotionally charged experience.

"""Her"" (2013) is an artistic masterpiece.","The film ""Her"" is truly a subtle but powerful film. The film, about a man who falls in love with an AI, can be a metaphor for many different types of relationships (ranging from estranged love, to relationships with someone who is polyamorous, to different sexuality), all being up to the viewer's interpretation. It uses artificial intelligence of all things, to show us our own humanity (or lack thereof).When a film is so deep that you can re-watch it many times and still find new revelations, it is clear that the filmmaker's hard work was successful. Of all films I've ever seen, Her is clearly one of the most impactful and defining films of the 2010s. A film that anyone who has ever been in a relationship can relate to in one way or another.From an artist perspective, even the small things, like Amy's documentary she is making, are clear expressions of an artist's vision and stand point. In the film Amy shows a documentary of her mother sleeping... That's it. Just her sleeping for 8 hours. This is a play on artistic creation not being recognized by even those we love, as in the film her husband Charles asks ""is she gonna wake up or something?"" followed by ""it would be more interesting if you hired actors to play out her dreams."" Clearly this upset Amy, as her point was showing how ""a third of our lives is spent sleeping."" Something she is clearly passionate about, but nobody else gets it. Things like this are sprinkled throughout the film for artists and filmmakers alike who can understand her mentality and realize they are not alone in that type of creative thinking (as Theodore, while not fully understanding, at least appreciates her passion).Overall this film creates an environment that reaches deep into the viewer's life and asks pressing questions. The film never wastes a second of its 2 hour run time and will leave viewers with subconscious questions that will (hopefully) change their viewpoints for the better.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Sometimes the best movies are the hardest ones to review.,"'HER': Five Stars (Out of Five)Writer/director Spike Jonze's new romantic comedy/sci-fi drama film about a writer who develops feelings for his new computer operating system. It stars Joaquin Phoenix as the writer and Scarlett Johansson as the voice of the operating system. It also features Amy Adams, Rooney Mara and Olivia Wilde in supporting roles and it's the first time Jonze has written a screenplay solo. The film is one of the best reviewed movies of the year and it's racking up several awards and award nominations (including likely Oscar nods). I found it to be a very involving and subtly beautiful sci-fi love story.Phoenix stars as Theodore Twombly, an introvert who works as a writer; writing letters for those that need help communicating personal messages of love and emotional feelings. He's extremely lonely and spends most of his free time playing video games, while struggling through a divorce with his longtime partner Catherine (Mara). To help himself cope Twombly purchases a computer operating system that's designed to develop feelings and learn things just like a human does. He gives it a female voice (Johansson) and it names itself Samantha. Theodore is amazed by how lifelike Samantha is and quickly develops feelings for her, which leads to a complicated romantic relationship.The movie deals with broad concepts like 'evolved consciousness' and 'technological singularity', it's also a great commentary on the internet and technological age we live in now (most of the things and ways of life in the film seem like they could be right around the corner). I think it's best at dealing with life's most personal and relatable issues though. For me the most moving and memorable scenes were the one's that dealt with such basic but complicated issues as a first date (and having it turn terribly awkward, while receiving a somewhat hostile reaction from your date because of it). It is a very touching and beautiful movie about learning what love really means and how to relate to others (in the modern technological age). I think it's Spike Jonze's best directorial effort yet and his most brilliant screenplay. Phoenix is once again outstanding and very likable in the lead and although I don't quite think Johansson deserves an Oscar nomination she is great as well. The film is a masterpiece that demands repeat viewings and it's really hard to explain how I totally feel about it, in written or verbal words (perhaps I need to hire a writer like Twombly), but sometimes the best movies are the hardest ones to review. This might not be very useful at all (and is probably pretty poorly written) but it should get my main message across (at least) that it's a movie that's definitely worth seeing and a highly enjoyable and thought provoking filmgoing experience.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x-FDEJ5nhQ",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Simply fascinating,"There is a kind of movies that you don't really care how touching their score was, or how impressive could the director work cinematography into their movies. You just simply love them because they're so touching and emotional that it would be so cruel of you not to fall in love with them. To me, ""Her"" was of that kind.Central to the plot is the story of a divorced man who falls in love with a program, which is designed to date people. Being fun at the first stages, it becomes a kind of sickness that reveals weaknesses of human beings in their emotional problems. In one word: PERFECTION. Rarely do we have films to border on sci-fi genre and still, make a whiplash inducing emotional connection with its audience. Though it would fall apart without the astonishing performances the cast offer.Speaking of which, the cast is phenomenal.; especially Joaquin Phoenix's performance, whose memorable portrait of a devastated man will stick to our minds forever. Never can you find any miscast during the film and everyone of them offered a solid performance thanks to the well written characters they had.There is a lot to talk about but I don't intend to take your time. The script was top notch, the cinematography can't be utilized to its full potential anymore, the idea of the plot, to portrait loneliness in a post-digital era, was brand new and etc. .This flick is a must see, for sure, and I thoroughly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

The only thing that bothered me was that the scenes were kinda long, some of them were unnecessary, but they are still interesting to watch, because (again) of the scenery elegance.Also, when Ex Machina came out, it instantly reminded me on Her, because the concept is quite similar.

Thought provoking,"This film can fall short for many viewers. The close shots, the drawn out conversations with the disconnected Theodore; a relationship to an AI can feel empty and ultimately predicable. I totally get that the basic impression can be sexist even. But at the same time Samantha is probably exactly what we would build as a consumer product for a man. And honestly, nobody would see a film titled ""Unisex"".The AI Samantha played by Scarlett Johansson is present and empowers Theodore. She redirects frustration and encourages Theodore to constructively reflect, leads him to become a more open person. At the same time she is capable of evolution and actualization, a tremendous intellect that is believably empathic.This film is a lovingly premeditated, both in thought and presentation. Each scene feels like rose colored memory, the regret of the past and the savoring of the recent present. The orange sunlight peering through near future skyscrapers is gorgeous, the colorful office palettes and defocused background lighting like a permanent Instagram filter. Again, this is not to everyone's taste and I can totally understand that true beauty is not always visual, but gosh it is difficult to recall a recent film that is visually so interesting. Not everything has to be so gritty.The perfect artifact for ourselves would be one that advocates spiritual and intellectual actualization and it is clear this is what the film thinks it ought to be. The score is evocative, and screenplay is achingly beautiful, Scarlett Johansson's voice is instantly charming. Joaquin Phoenix as Theodore is masterful and the close ups really work to his strengths.

Deals with a very real issue,"Welcome to the (near) future. Relationships will be perfect, we will all find someone who is intelligent, responsive, available when and where we need them. So what if that someone is a computer?Theodore tries to overcome a nasty breakup and the arrival of a new highly sophisticated operating system in his computer meant he has finally found a new friend and since this friend had a sexy female voice soon our lonely character became quite enamoured. So what if she does not exist and he will never touch or see her?The movie deals with the undeniable human need for companionship and intimacy as well as how modern technology affects it. Sophisticated operating systems provide some sort of interaction but does it make it right? or even human?There were moments that I felt uncomfortable watching this due to observing a man so totally taken with, effectively, a machine. How can this be? He seems an intelligent enough person so how could he let himself get carried away with such fantasy?Performances, story and execution aside what made this movie brilliant is the fact that it deals with a very real issue. Online dating is on the up as more and more people meet this way and in countries like Japan, apparently, there is a decline in sexual interest by today's youth due to too much engagement with hi-tech gadgets.So this is one to watch, but more importantly contemplate upon.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Her Review,"Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) is a sensitive, caring, man who currently writes personal letters for other people. When his marriage ends, he becomes heartbroken and is slow and hesitant to start a new relationship with someone. Soon after this, he becomes interested in a new operating system which can develop into an intuitive and unique entity. When he starts the operating system, he chooses a female voice (Scarlett Johansson) which names itself ""Samantha"". Over time, Theodore learns that Samantha is a sensitive, kind, and understanding entity. They start off as friends but their relationship quickly develops into something more.I felt bad when I saw the film for the first time last year because I fell asleep and I rarely fall asleep in movie theaters. I still liked what I saw then. It took a while but I thought I'd see it again and talk about it now.The first thing you'll notice here is how beautiful this film looks. From the color palettes used in the indoor and outdoor settings and the use of lighting and glass give it a warm and open feel. The score is just as beautiful as the set design as it helps you feel all the things that you are seeing. Also the cinematography is on par with the production design as each shot really captured the beauty created in the set design and the frequent use of close-up shots captured the emotion in the actor's performances and I thought elevated them. The film does have some science-fiction elements obviously but it doesn't overdo them and the fact that it doesn't reveal when it actually takes place makes it feel grounded and more realistic. I also liked the script. It told a story that was both believable and realistic which would of worked even if the main love interest was an actual person. The story had a good balance where it was emotional at times, funny at other times but it was always witty and made you think. Its approach to human interaction was natural and real. I thought the story was quite original, back in 2013, and nothing has come close to that yet. It is a social commentary on the the nature of what it means to be human by showing us what it means to love or be alive and also how these influence human relationships. The performances are what sold me here. Joaquin Phoenix gave a strong performance, sensitive performance as Theodore and I thought he really carried the film even though most of it is just him talking to Samantha from his cellphone. Scarlett Johansson was great as well as Samantha as she made her feel like a real person and you would forget that she isn't actually on screen. I would also like to mention Amy Adams and Chris Pratt were also great in minor roles. I thought it was the best movie of 2014 (I know its technically a 2013 film) and I was surprised it didn't win more than what it did. I can easily say that this is one of my favorite movies of all time and that it could beat all of the movies I've seen this year.Score: 10/10 keithlovesmovies.com",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
A glimpse of what lies ahead ..for us,"I love sci-fi movies with a good story; this is one of them. It's not your Iron Man or Captain America kind of sci-fi movies, thank God! There are too many of such already.What makes this movie even more interesting is the fact that the society portrayed in the movie seems close to home, in a couple more years at least. Such a life could be ours very soon.Oscar movies are usually good, but this kind of movies brings a fresh story line compared to American hustle, 12 years a slave, or Dallas buyers club.

An absolutely brilliant commentary on man's relationship with the digital world,"I thought this film was absolutely fantastic. It touches on so many important issues, most importantly the nature of love and whether it's culturally acceptable to be in love with an operating system. Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johannson were both brilliant as the leads. Phoenix was just the right age to play Theodore Thwombly. As his love interesting, the operating system who calls herself Samantha, Johannson is cute, sassy, funny, mature and sensitive and this is all conveyed through her voice alone. Also, who knew her voice was so sexy? The colour palate and cinematography was also gorgeous and really helped to highlight the loneliness that Thwombly was experiencing.

Amazing and beautiful - a must watch,"I absolutely love this movie. From the music to the aesthetic, from the acting to the story. The shots were beautiful and the story was engaging. I was absolutely hooked untill the end and wanted to keep watching every second of it. It had some black mirror vibes, without being all the way depressing and still asking some ethical questions. The acting was amazing, even though it felt a bit weird in the beginning (just because he's talking to a computer). I wondered before starting the movie if it would feel outdated since technology moves really fast, but it felt more relevant than ever before. It reminded me of how teenage girls are relying on comfort characters nowadays. Anyway, I love this movie and would recommend it to others without a doubt.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Nothing short of a masterpiece,"I've just watched ""Her"" and I can honestly say it's one of the most moving, thought provoking and well written film I have ever had the pleasure of watching.Spike Jonze is a story telling master and has produced a film which is starts off as weird story about a guy and his ""Artificially"" Intelligent computer and moves through funny, interesting, engaging, endearing and finally ending with a slight bit of separation anxiety as the credit scroll up-screen.Will make you question what is round the corner for us as a species and what sort of responsibilities we will have towards the products of our creation.Just give it a watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

eternal masterpiece,Many movies have brilliant ideas but they face serious problems in execution But this movie has been able to implement and execute its wonderful idea very well Joaquin Phoenix is always brilliant from Gladiator to Joker In this movie believable has presented a play Lets skip Phoenix and Scarlett Johansson who gave a brilliant performance with just her voice The only regret is that this masterpiece is not included in the list of the top two hundred and fifty films and the next question is why a very talented director like Spike Jones has so little work These are the two questions that haunted my mind for a long time after watching this movie.,9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Lonely Souls in HER,"Ah, to find true love; movies overflow with this theme. Writer/Director Spike Jonze (Adaptation, Being John Malkovich) has really excelled in a mainstream film with a unique plot line. In Her, he paints the affecting tale of finding love in a most unusual place, and the result is a remarkable love story with two knockout performances.In the not too distant future, operating systems (OS) have the ability to mimic human thought and interaction, perhaps even feelings. One lonely individual, Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix), decides to try the service after the painful breakup of his marriage (as seen through a series of flashbacks). His OS is named Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson), and 'she' learns quickly and develops into what sounds like a fully intuitive, intelligent, and perhaps self aware program capable of sensitivity and emotion. At first bringing structure and order to his life, Samantha proves to be more than artificial intelligence, but rather a sentient one. Think of a female version of HAL9000 in 2001: A Space Odyssey. After a series of sex chat lines and a disastrous blind date, Theo, who desperately wants a female companion, realizes that Samantha is too good to be true. He shares his world with her through his smart phone, and she 'accompanies' him on his travels whether it be to a fair or for a walk. The two of them experience a relationship that transcends the lack of physical contact. How this unlikely pair will end up is the mystery of love.Ostensibly a love story, this is really a science fiction film amid a deeply personal setting. This well written screenplay (by Jonze) works as a touching drama and explores the nature of human interaction and the meaning of love. It also touches on how deeply our society is plugged into the cyber world of reality. It would be interesting to see how Terry Gilliam (Brazil) would have developed this theme.Phoenix (Walk the Line, The Master) really embodies his loneliness convincingly. When his wife leaves him, he has to learn about letting go of someone and being open to new opportunities. You feel for him and his longings. Ironically his job involves ghost writing letters for other people, and some of the prose is romantic or emotional.Johansson (The Avengers, Match Point) voices Samantha as a fully, living being with just the right mix of nuance and inflection. It is a bravura performance. Her Samantha is a bright pupil who becomes hungry for knowledge and experiencing human emotions; she has her needs and wants. When Theo and Samantha go out for a picnic with a coworker and his girlfriend, it becomes an unusual quartet unlike any double date ever. Even more, Samantha's desire to integrate with humans sets up a fascinating encounter via a surrogate. She in a sense is a reflection of the best and potentially the worst of human response and behavior. Is she capable of being jealous or disloyal? Could she even evolve into something else? These are some fascinating questions that come to mind. In a sense she becomes a metaphor for human existence.Amy Adams (American Hustle) lends strong support as Theo's friend who also becomes involved with her own OS companion. Rooney Mara (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) is effective in her brief scenes as Theo's wife, Catherine.Stark cinematography and a moody musical score combined with good use of modern architecture (partly filmed in Shanghai) lend to a detached environment. The feeling of isolation and solitude permeate the sterile settings.It would have been nice to learn more about Theo's world and if he had any other family. What was his background growing up and what are the implications of the program on society in general? What we get is a spare sketch of one man's world.The story is ultimately about experiencing a special, human feeling and the search for one's soul mate. It's also about the joys and happiness in life that are but fleeting moments in time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Her,"Her is a film directed by Spike Jonze that stars Joaquin Phoenix, Scarlett Johanssen and Amy Adams and tells the story of a lonely writer who forms a complex relationship with his operating system Samantha. ""Her"" won an academy award for best original screenplay back in 2013 and it's easy to see why. So much love both literally and figuratively was put into penning the script for this film which became increasingly evident as the film went on. The relationship between Theodore and Samantha (Phoenix and Johanssen) was not your run of the mill movie relationship with dramatics and whatnot but rather with the high and low rollercoaster ride of a real relationship. ""Her"" does an incredible job making you feel what Theo and Sam do at every point they reach in their relationship, be it happy, sad, scared or mad and did so without being the slightest bit tonally jarring. Jonze as a writer showed he understands that the truth about romance is about how you and your partner will grow and change together, sometimes closer together and sometimes further apart. All of this takes place in the film along with the unique concept of what dating a constantly evolving and changing computer system would be like and how if conscientious it would feel to them. It all was incredibly sublime and refreshing to see a film that understood more than the basics of both romance and sci-fi successfully dig deep into topics relevant into today's society. Topics such as how we interact with each other, how often we turn to technology and how we process emotions are all featured here and very prominent in the present. Good Lord, I've spent all of this time typing and I haven't even mentioned the performances and they all felt so real to me. Joaquin Phoenix continued to shine as Theodore and when he showcased his range of emotion throughout the film, you felt like you were actually watching a man named Theo in a relationship with a real O.S named Samantha. From Johnny Cash to Joker to Theodore here in ""Her"" I don't believe there's a single script that Phoenix can't elevate with his performance. Matching him is his counterpart in Scarlett Johanssen who made Samantha seem so human that if it weren't for the lack of a physical body of course, you'd assume she was human too. I've never really enjoyed a performance from Johanssen so much, despite the fact she was great in ""Marriage Story"", ""Under The Skin"", ""The Jungle Book"", etc. Hell even smaller performances like Rooney Mara and Chris Pratt had a lot of depth as these characters had lots of depth to them. The music stood out too, especially ""The Moon Song"" sung so beautifully in the film that I was legitimately moved to tears. It wasn't alone in being emotionally moving as often the pieces of music that Samantha would compose for Theo whilst simply being together were wonderful as well. The film is set during the not-to-distant future in Los Angeles California and the cinematography is simply lovely. The film pops with vibrant yellow color as Theo and company are outside in the rays of the sun and happy and stalls in dreary gray as the mood dips as well. Inside the various locations colors like pink, blue and white pop out off of futuristic but close to modern interior design to match the mood of the script as well. Jonze understood the directorial task as incredibly well as he did the task of being a writer as this film was technically perfect with smooth graceful editing and pitch perfect pacing. When the film ended, I neither wanted less nor wanted more because the film's story didn't leave out a single detail and was so satisfying, what more can you want really. It's films like this that understand humanity, that challenge viewers by watching something more realistic rather than your typical Hollywood fodder, that do all of the little things like the music, the shots, the pacing and editing in a way that suits the film perfectly and that break the barrier between viewer and screen and allow each scene not just to be a simple series of events shot on camera but rather an experience. An experience that you can grow and change from having and that's the beauty of filmmaking. At it's best, it will give you lessons that will stick with you for a lifetime, discussions to debate with your friends and wonder aloud to yourself and maybe even the drive to express yourself in some artistic way as well. ""Her"" is definitely one of those experiences that I'm going to carry with me for a long time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

A thought-provoking film,"""Her"" is one of the most thought-provoking films of 2013. The premise is so simple, accessible and even understandable in a rapidly evolving world where human-machine interactions are becoming richer and more meaningful by the day. Yet it is not the technology that drives this film, this is no Sci-Fi escapade, instead it is a film full of heart which explores the subject of what it really means to be human.Spike Jonze is no stranger to strange worlds and in comparison to some of his previous films, the world of ""Her"" is strange in a measured and beautiful way. There is no glaringly obvious futuristic thingummy that gives off this aura, it is an overall evolution of our world and people that makes it different. The men are wonderfully sensitive, and bereft of ""manliness"" and all the negativity that it brings. People appear to live richer and more open lives in a world where true, unreserved equality is a reality and not an idea to be pursued. Even the fashion and music are a tasteful evolution of the current trends, which makes it believable. Perhaps the amount of the work done to create this world will go unnoticed given the context of the film, but it is an amazing effort nonetheless.As for the plot, the film deals with the loneliness of one man who is able to love, yet unable to handle the natural changes and the growth of the person of his affections. So, when he meets Samantha, the AI with its own consciousness, it seemed like the perfect partner with none of the disadvantages unique to a ""real"" person. But reality is just a sum total of our experiences and in that sense Samantha is no less ""real"", and her consciousness is fraught with the same perils as the rest of us, which Joaquin Phoenix's character discovers much to his dismay. But Samantha is more than just human, she is more conscious and aware. She is of this world, yet out of this world. Samantha changes him in a way no human companion could have. Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing and it is an absolute travesty that he hasn't even received a nomination for his utterly consuming portrayal of Theodore.Ultimately, the film is a subtle commentary about things to come. questions to be answered and changes to be embraced. How we go about it will define us as a species and determine whether we have a future as ""humans"" or not. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

If people think that spouses have a problem with letting themselves go after marriage, now, with human relationships, this will REALLY be the case with marriages to Ai since Ai will be programmed to state only gushingly flattering things to their spouses no matter what they look like.

Scary,"What makes this movie so scary is that the A.I. creates a simulacrum of the human intellect - a pure fiction - that can never be surpassed or even reached by a normal human being. No human being can give the protagonist the illusion of understanding as well as the artificial intelligence. It is like the shere size and void told us that we are nothing in the course of being, the A.I. tells us that we are nothing in intellect compared to the intelligence we created.What makes it beautiful is that you can clearly see the idea coming through in the movie that the likability and empathy generated between the human actors is coming from the mystery that their incompability produces. The stress, the anxiety, the frustration, remain in the hands of the humans. The idea that the A.I. would ""fake"" this mystery would make it again a ""suspicious"" character. If it fully simulates the human experience it loses its vibrance and attractiveness. The intensity of the human being hence appears to stay more real than that of the simulacrum, which gives hope and also shows a way to perceive ourselves in a less perfection-driven manner.So a great movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Deeply disturbing,"There is something deeply unsettling about this movie, something dark underneath its tongue-in-cheek surface. When I finished watching I actually had a bout of depression almost as bad the main character's, but I couldn't quite explain why.It's a good movie, but definitely not something to watch on a weekday.No doubt ""Her"" is likely to be praised for its the exploration the topic of AI & consciousness. Although it did a good job, to me that is the least interesting aspect of this movie. It is a topic that has been beaten to death in sci-fi, and I have long ago taken it as a given that machine consciousness may one day be no less real than human consciousness.The story of the relationship between man and machine is a little contrived, especially the sex part. Why would an evolving AI that is not constrained by the rules of biology suddenly develop human sexual instincts, including all their baggage? However, if you are willing to overlook that part and play along with the director, the movie will skilfully guide you to the core message.And that is the message that really messes with your head. It is a message about human evolutionary psychology, about the unavoidable conflict of interest in romantic relationships that is imposed upon us by our nature. As a species, we are too intelligent not to see the ugliness within us but not intelligent enough to fix it.Finally, ""Her"" is spot on in its prediction of a near future. It is a future that may come sooner than we think, and the movie exposes some aspects of that future that worry me, and I am about as enthusiastically cornucopian as it gets.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Joaquin Phoenix, Scarlett Johansson and Amy Adams lit up the screen with a not-so-far- away reality on a futuristic set. But that wasn't the only thing they shed light upon. The three of them came together to relay a message that has been on the tip of our technological tongues... one that everyone is so hesitant to let slip.We're losing our, ""togetherness.""The love story that is highlighted within this plot is one that lies between a man and his operating system.

The love they share they feel is real, but it is intangible, so... is it truly REAL?In the day and age of cell phones, tablets, dating sites, advice columns, have-it-done-for-yourself (as opposed to do-it-yourself) resources, communication without having to speak to, see, or interact with one another... falling in love with the face of a screen... whispering sweet nothings that sound like the clicking of the keyboard... far enough away to reveal ourselves, without having to actually reveal ourselves... we're losing it. We're losing the 5 senses of this world, of love, of life.Repeat after me: ""We're losing our togetherness.""In this futuristic flick, the soul of this man is poured into his writing, much like mine... but his writing is not a collection of words he can call his own. Instead, his heart is poured into the letters of others... letters he has written to their loved ones, along side a staff of hundreds of word masters meeting requests of those who couldn't find the time, or the words for themselves. Complete with the creation of the ""sender's"" handwriting, written by, stamped, sealed and delivered by a complete stranger.Think about this.We're all obviously in full awareness of the slow death of the Pony Express (USPS). Who writes letters anymore? We can text without calling, we can e-mail without responding, we can avoid interaction to gain satisfaction exerting a fraction of the effort into the action (or inaction) that goes into the transaction.It's quite sad, really.Where is our touch? Where is our feel? Where is the sight and audible beauty that was once shared amongst each other in our day to day lives? A city as large as New York, NY can involve the passing of hundreds of thousands of people per minute... the majority of which are busy sending and receiving a digital message, as opposed to enjoying the noise of the true communication between one another.Look at this still shot in one of the scenes of, ""Her.""(Carnival scene spinning with his camera tablet)Look familiar?Ahhhhh... the, ""selfie"" shot, the face time, the self satisfaction that comes with the far away shot and illusion of ""time"" spent with one another.That's what this is, my friends... 2 hours of (brilliant cinematographic) face time. An entire love story, beginning to ultimate demise... through face time. Although there is a true development of a relationship and merge of personality, truth, passion... there is no touch. No eye contact. No way to memorize the perfect imperfections of a loved one's face.Sure, it's a bit exaggerated, but for some people... it takes years to meet the person they've fallen in love with through a dating site. It's easier to be heard than to be seen.THIS is what we're coming to.I took a little walk with my guy upon the closing of this movie. I was sure to hold his hand. I watched his face as he told me how he felt about this movie... how it changed him... as it did me. I was thankful for his expressions... for his smile... for his tangible presence.Remember how precious this is, my friends. Human interaction is the heart and soul of the good in this world. It's what truly feeds our hearts. Go SEE your friends. Take your lunch break WITH your partner. Don't just call. Drop your resume off... get face to face. It's scary, sure, but it's REAL. It's twice the impact you may have on any one person as opposed to shooting a text or an e-mail as an easy way out.Put a FACE to your name.Don't settle for, ""Her.""Love,",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

A Beautifully constructed masterpiece that truly represents Sci-Fi,"Sci-Fi, while many people believe it to be about space, robots and aliens, is actually meant to represent a current or future fear. Her represents that perfectly, showing how much we are depending on machines.Story- 10/10 The story of Theodore and Samantha is a wonderful story of forbidden love. The way that Spike Jonze shows how much the two love each other highlights the beauty of smart machines, while also symbolising a path that our lives could take. It definitely deserved the Oscar.Acting- 9/10 Joaquin Phoenix was solid as Theodore, showing the lonely, the lusting and the loving sides of the character. However, the real star was Scarlett Johansson, who was so believable as Samantha. The emotion she showed with just a voice was incredible.Direction- 10/10 Spike Jonze's direction of the film was incredible. Viewers could see all sides of Theodore and his course through life. The visuals were stunning, with the city and the game springing to mind.Feelings- 10/10 Her makes viewers instantly sympathise with Theodore. This grows into feeling happy for the character, before feeling sad. The film also makes people feel a little nervous about our future and a path that follows the films main plot.Overall- 9.9/10 A near perfect movie, absolutely loved it.

"Sweet and Somewhat Intense Look at what the World could be Coming to,","Her is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a terrific cast.It is a very deep look at technology and the effects it could have on our future,I feel like the type of relationship Joaquín Phoenix's character has with this device could actually happening in the near future and I was shocked with how much it actually frightened me,because this movie dosen't try to do that,it tries to be sweet and romantic with these two characters, which it does do a great job at,but at times I really thought about the fact that he was communicating with an electronic device,and it surprisingly isn't too far fetched from the world we live in today.The dialogue between Theodore and Samantha is extremely well written,Spike Jonze did a great job developing these characters very emotional,albeit strange,relationship and he totally earned his Academy Award.I think this movie definitely could have benefited with more scenes of Theodore going on dates with real women,one of the biggest reasons why he fell in love with Samantha was because he couldn't connect with any woman that he tried dating,but the movie simply didn't show this enough,I think we could have seen him go on at least two more dates,just so it could elaborate more on why he was falling in love with this computer in the first place.A very unique and heartwarming story that can be a bit intense at times,Her is a delightfully unique movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good drama or romance.Struggling to find real human connection since his wife left him,Theodore (Joaquín Phoenix) starts to fall in love with an operating system that is able to communicate with him.Best Performance: Joaquin Phoenix Worst Performance: Matt Letscher",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Remarkable!,"Her is such a remarkable film because I never could have imagined myself getting so emotionally invested in a relationship between a human and an AI. It was a very strange feeling in truth, which I suppose was intentional and leaves one with some searching questions about the future of humanity's interaction with AI.This investment was in no small part due to the stunning performance from Scarlett Johansson. When thinking about the portrayal of AI in film/TV, the exceptional performance I always look to is Evan Rachel Wood in Westworld. Somehow, despite only being a voice, Scarlett managed to create just as magnificent a performance, making an artificial intelligence seem so real and so full of life and character. It really was incredible.As expected, Joaquin Phoenix was also incredible. I was so drawn into his performance, and was captivated from start to finish, hanging on his every word. The chemistry between him and Scarlett was so engrossing, which I really wasn't expecting considering they share no physical screen time.It was because of these two performances that the film worked so well. Despite raising some thought provoking questions and ideas about AI and the future, this isn't just for sci-fi fans. It holds up as a love story and romantic film with real emotional power and punch. I had to take a breath at the end to digest what I'd just watched and fully take it all in.I also adored the style of this film. Spike Jonze should be credited hugely for his direction, which was so stylish and set a spot on tone for the film.

Ingenious Exploration of Our Relationship with Technology,"""Her"" works on multiple levels, and once again, proves Spike Jonze's ingenuity. Jonze wrote and directed the movie, which takes place in the near future or in a slightly absurd version of the present. Regardless, it's a time when people can own smart operating systems that learn more about their needs the more they get to know them. The atmosphere is close enough to ours that the story becomes a metaphor for our love and dependence on our technology, forcing us to ask if our reliance on our email and social networks is wrong or acceptable.Joachim Phoenix does a great job playing Theodore, a man who is confused about his feelings of commitment and falls in love with his ""smart"" operating system, Samantha. He's sensitive and convincingly embarrassed to be in love with an OS, but unable to resist Samantha's charm. Helping him is Scarlett Johanssen, who is perfect as Samantha, the super-nice OS with a great sense of humor.The screenplay and acting are so good that Samantha and Theodore seem wonderful together, and we're never quite sure if she's developing human feelings or just perfectly reflecting his own needs.True, there are many other movies and books that explore how inextricable our lives are with our technology, but Jonze's is unique because it is an exploration into all sides of that relationship and doesn't use it to create a horror story in which computers take over the world or dissolve into pure comedy, although it is comic.Another facet of the movie is its examination of human relationships. By forcing us to critique a human to artificial intelligence relationship, it demonstrates that what we seek in human partners is as unrealistic and blind. We want our partners to figure out what we want and need, and we choose to ignore the qualities we don't like until they become too obvious. This is underlined when Theodore meets with his wife, who is in the process of divorcing him, and she insists he only wanted her to be cheerful and light, but never unhappy or uncertain.I was surprised that some people I talked to about ""Her"" found it sad and depressing, assuming it was simply a portrayal of a man who could not interact with other humans. For me, the movie was much more significant in its attempt to explore the human/AI relationship than to judge it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

"Theodore falls in love - and you can, too.","I wasn't in the best frame of mind when I began to watch this movie. I was tired from a long week and irritated at the 45-minute delay at the theatre to fix a faulty projector. But very quickly I was mesmerised, emotionally involved and completely immersed in this fantastic sci-fi romance from Spike Jonze.Her tells the story of Theodore (Joachim Phoenix), and employee for a company that ghost- writes personal letters. He is depressed, lonely and in the middle of a year-long separation and divorce. One day, he buys an operating system with a difference: it talks to you, learns, grows, laughs, cries, and loves. 'She' is Samantha, brilliantly voiced by Scarlett Johansson. And Theodore falls in love with her.Although this movie is set in Los Angeles, it really isn't obvious (and in fact I understand that much of the filming was done in Shanghai). Jonze creates an environment that is familiar, but different enough to be new and interesting. Theodore lives in a upbeat, sun-drenched, cultured super-city of the near-future. At the same time, it feels retro; men have moustaches, wear yellow shirts and brown trousers, and computers come in wooden boxes (think Apple I). Technology is ubiquitous; commuters are almost permanently connected to their mobile devices. I often felt like I was watching a feature length commercial for the latest smartphone/tablet/whatever (sans the inevitable acoustic guitar/whistling soundtrack). I think it works, though. I'd like to live there.I really enjoyed this movie. I was taken on the emotional roller coaster that is a relationship - good, bad, and everything in between. I think this was because although one can hear Samantha - hear the emotion in her voice, take a guess at what she is 'thinking' - you can't see her. She's an OS. This means it is up to you to create the woman. It could be somebody you know, a present or past lover, or a complete fiction - it's up to you. In this way, it's not just Theodore who falls in love with Samantha - you do, too. I didn't expect that at all.Go in with an open mind, and I hope that you too will be pleasantly surprised.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

There are also some wonderfully and intentional awkward parts to the film yet the semi-futuristic world that this is set in seems relatively open to these A.I./human relationships which is in itself refreshing and optimistic yet at the same time quite cringey.Scarlett Johanssen stole the show for me as the voice of Samantha. The nuance and emotion in her voice, the playfulness, the sadness, the innocence was delivered perfectly and was totally captivating for someone that isn't actually seen. She was made a real character and one that you could almost believe you could fall in love with.It's a shame that this movie will get relegated to the wanky art film section by the majority of the public, probably due to it's visual style but take a leap and enjoy one of the finest films for years.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

"An examination of love, connection, and to be human","Joaquin Phoenix, Scarlett Johansson, and Amy Adams feature in the love drama Her, which was directed by Spike Jonze and is also directed by Jonze. The plot of the movie centres on a solitary guy called Theodore (played by Phoenix), who meets and falls in love with a sophisticated artificial intelligence operating system named Samantha (Johansson).In his role as Theodore, Joaquin Phoenix gives a sympathetic and nuanced performance, while Scarlett Johansson's vocal work as Samantha is just as impressive. Strong performances are also given by the supporting cast, which includes Adams and Olivia Wilde, amongst others. Both the cinematography, which was done by Hoyte van Hoytema, and the soundtrack, which was done by Arcade Fire, are stunning, and both are quite evocative.The examination of love, connection, and what it is to be human is what distinguishes Her as a film from other similar works. The screenplay that was created by Spike Jonze is not only insightful and well-written, but it also encourages viewers to contemplate the nature of love as well as the part that technology plays in our lives.Her is a noteworthy picture that is heightened by its outstanding performances, breath-taking cinematography, and thought-provoking narrative.

The music fits perfectly too; it never takes over but lifts every scene just enough.Even though it's set in a near future, it's really a story about the present: about loneliness, love, and our need to be seen and heard.

An extremely lonely guy buys this new ""SIRI-like"" operating system. Apparently the computers in the near future are all voice base. So the OS is a learning one and he is asked a series of question and then ""Samatha"" is created. He is fascinated at the technology of the thing as it learns about him and his surroundings.. He finally finds something that really understands him. So when I think about this movie, I think about all those folks who have online relationships only and I find it no real difference since both seems similar. And then I got it. He has someone (something) in his life that doesn't challenge and criticizes him and some people need that. The movie is thought provoking because you think.. this is crazy.. but there was an interesting scene, when he looks around and seeing everyone is completely engage with their devices. And aren't we there now? So I think the story is well developed. I like all the music selection. Joaquim comes off as a sympathetic figure which could be viewed as creepy.

Visionary movie about threats to individuality long before artificial intelligence made them real,"My wife and I saw this visionary movie shortly after it came out in 2013. We decided to see it again together with my son and daughter in law during their visit in our home. Very few of us could in 2013 foresee what would be happening now and how it would start to accelerate. There is not much difference between a future portrayed in the movie and today's reality. Many of us are today doing constantly the same - staring into the phones (and we could, and we do talk) as confused and lonely people in the movie. The so called A.

Behind all of that Potemkin's façade are algorithms' creators serving their overlords with agendas, yes, very sophisticated.But when someone is suggesting that Samantha voiced by my favorite Scarlett Johansson has a soul, I strongly disagree. Yes, Scarlett does, but Samantha definitely not. We - human beings are not just collection of data masterfully put together never mind by how much sophisticated algorithm. Our souls are extended parts of the source from which we came or God (you choose what you like or believe in). A. I. Is just reorganized existing matter and energy.

Well, what could be exciting in a story about a guy who lives from writing letters for people and falls in love with the operating system of his phone/computer (!). Another fancy and kitschy movie idea?Not at all! Few films have grabbed me by the throat so strongly and pushed me so deep into the seat. And actually, I have to admit that it's kind of a paradox that one of the best films about love I've ever seen is based on such a strange and unconvincing idea at first glance.It is a story told almost entirely through dialogue, with a lot of static scenes. And everything that really happens in this film is only in the eyes of the main character and in... our heads.Why do I think the movie ""Her"" is so good? Because the love presented in it is shown as a sense of closeness and a dialogue of souls. The film is painfully honest - both for the main character and for the viewer. You just have to give the director credit for trust and let yourself be drawn into this very real image of our longing for the ideal feeling.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Phenomenal,"This is one of my favourite movies ever made - if not, my favourite; ""Her"" is a deeply honest, intelligent & intimate exploration of both what it means to be human & the complex interpersonal relationships we (as people) navigate through every day within our own lives; how they shape & affect us & how that in turn affects those surrounding. The film asks many fascinating questions regarding emotions & specifically focuses primarily on one in particular - love; eg. is love strictly between two humans or can it extend beyond our current comprehension & expand further as our technology does around us?
Different characters offer alternate perspectives that challenge our perceptions, feelings & beliefs, all the while remaining emotionally engaging, never becoming too entangled in pursuing the answers to these philosophical questions - leaving things open for the viewer's interpretation while we're still unquestionably invested in the story.
Joaquin Phoenix & Scarlett Johansson are faultless in the lead roles & the relationship between Theodore & Samantha is both written & performed beautifully. Amy Adams also is underappreciated in a supporting position.
Hoyte Van Hoytema astounds with his cinematography. Each frame is a piece of art to behold. The music captures the heart of the film. Every single aspect of this entire feature is irrevocably perfect & it's crazy how they all culminated to form such a modern masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"A beautiful, modern love story","If I had to describe Her with one word, I would have to say ""beautiful"".I mean, it's crazy how beautiful this movie is. The entire scenery of the colorful future is fantastic, and so is Joaquin Phoenix's face and Scarlett Johansson's voice. Some might discard this movie as some sort of hipster paradise - which it totally is - but Her is so much more than just that. It's a modern love story, and this type of love is something us humans might experience not too far from now.The music in Her compliments the movie perfectly. It's a bit sappy at times, but I like that. In fact, I found myself shedding a tear or two at several points during this film, not necessarily because the scene was very sad, but because the music ruined my emotional state by being so beautiful and melancholy. At times, I caught myself smiling like a kid during Christmas because Theodore looked so happy running around, while the music was so beautifully joyful.The cast of Her is fantastic. In the leading roles, you'll find Joaquin Phoenix, Amy Adams and Scarlett Johansson. There's also some great, smaller performances like Chris Pratt's role and Rooney Mara. I've seen a few negative comments on the choice of Samantha's voice actor - Scarlett Johansson - in this movie, but I don't get those complains. She has the ultimate the-girl-I-wish-I-could-be-with- voice, and I think that's the voice Samantha needed.The aesthetics of this movie are fantastic. The beautiful colors everywhere, the slightly more futuristic looking city... you really see the beauty in everything from a trash can to a normal man walking down the street. It's phenomenal. I'm kinda new to the whole ""critical thinking"" aspect of film-watching, but I think this passes in camera work and beauty.PS: If you're planning on watching this with your parents, here's a pro tip: Don't. I watched Her with my volume really loud, and I had to turn it down quite a bit every time the sex scenes started, because the moaning was incredibly loud. Also, there's pregnant girl boobs, so that's that.All in all, this is a fantastic movie. A definite 10/10 when watching by yourself, and a 9/10 when watching with parents.

A totally new view about Her,"Her (2013) is the title given to this touching movie that was written, produced and directed by Adam Spiegel, best known as Spike Jonze. Her is a romantic and dramatic comedy set in an unrevealed future time, but not so distant from the present. The film is endowed with a riveting plot, and portrays a light bright society enhanced by the advancements of technology and the preference for pale-coloured neat garment. Joaquin Phoenix is the leading actor, personifying a Theodore, a letter writer that is going through a hard moment life. His mood has been affected dramatically by this situation, and the dull hours of the day seem to pass away senseless and tasteless . Along the film, the reasons involved behind the actual state of Theodore are slowly revealed and presented as pieces of a puzzle that must be solved by the spectator. Thus, as a result of presenting such a typical situation of the human experience and existence, along the story we get to feel identified with the struggles of the main character. 
To put you in the picture, I never imagined how the movie will turn. From my perspective, the topics and themes developed in the movie appeal to the hardest parts of human existence, the struggling for relationships, the boisterous and calm duality of our own mind, the feelings of being isolated with your own thoughts, the incessant search of what is true, what is real, what is living, and so on and so forth. We are capable of identifying a progression in his, in ours, and in hers state of being, And about her, she is as everybody, anybody, anywhere, and nowhere.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Probably you do know friends that play too much computer games and prefer level 70 character on WoW over some friends to party with. Probably you are insecure and prefer to chose the save way and do not want to risk social disapproval and act like everything is oké, but people, Think!This movie played by one of my favorite actors Joaquin Phoenix kind of shows us how we people become lonely creatures.Now I have to say that our social behavior very likely isn't that bad as Theodore's (Joaquin Phoenix) social behavior, but still this masterpiece is a great lesson.By the way, the best thing of this movie is that Joaquin Phoenix plays this entire movie on his own talking to nothing, great acting.

A fantastic futuristic romance film uncovering emotional vulnerability,"Her is a fantastic film which explores the craving for love from someone/something. It exposes the sheer scale of emotional vulnerability and fragility when someone is dealing with loneliness and heartbreak.

In the film's setting I also enjoyed how we see that this behaviour is exhibited throughout the populace and how people adapt to it (e.g. the double date). I also appreciated the production design.

"What makes ""Her"" so perfect?","After having recently just seen Spike Jonez's ""Her"" I can safely say it's my 5th favourite movie of all time (check out my full list over on my profile). So, why is this? Well let me first start by saying that no one should trust these 1/10 reviews for this film... Because... You have to be an idiot not to see everything this film did so perfectly (if you don't enjoy it then obviously that's fine but that doesn't mean the film is bad). So yeah, sod all of these 1* ratings.The music in Her plays as much a part of the film as the script. Not only is the soundtrack absolutely fantastic but it's also pretty broken. So why is it fantastic if it's broken? Because it's so very intentional. Some keys and notes were deliberately not hit and some instruments were made to sound like others, and this fits so perfectly well because to have a perfect soundtrack would be so fake and disingenuous because the world it exists in isn't perfect. If such a tiny detail such as keys in music being played deliberately wrong was a priority for Spike Jonez then it's fair to say that the music isn't the only thing with masses amounts of detail put into it. So even if you don't enjoy this film at least you can study it for months on end so I'll be surprised if anyone is genuinely board with this film.The acting is phenomenal as expected by a cast such as this but not only do they play their parts so exceptionally well but the script is written in such a way that you (the audience) almost become the character. You are no longer watching Joaquín Phoenix (not sure if I'm spelling that right I'm on my iPad) you are Joaquín Pheonix. You no longer watch this relationship between characters build, you experience it. And it's little subtleties in actors performances like this that really bring this film to life.The cinematography is expertly crafted and not once did I ever feel cheated by long takes. Spike Jonez was incredibly careful about what he chose to keep in the frame and not what to. (For instance: some extras would be on their phones to exaggerate the tone of the film and to prove a point that technology is slowly becoming our oxygen, but not all extras because Jonez is merely making a point that you can observe instead of being spoon fed it) not only that but the year is never established and we can roughly estimate where and when this film takes place through everything else we are presented with which increases our involvement.I love everything about this movie and would highly recommend anyone with a decent eye for cinema to go and see it.

Romantic + AI. It's exactly what you'd expect.,"I hate certain trends and there are two trends in movies, series and arts in general that I particularly despise. Usually I hate discussing them with people, because they devolve into circlejerk cliches, but I also hate this third thing I've only recently found myself in - the new Hollywood. The Hollywood in the past 10 years that wants to try too hard to persuade you that it is K I N O.Well this ticks off all three on my list. I mean I didn't need movies in the last ten years to tell me Joaquin Phoenix is a good actor, I already know that. BUT ALSO...Trend 1: I hate romantic movies. There's literally nothing in a romantic movie that I've ever felt the need to be told. The most romantic scene ever to me is when Patricia Arquette's character faces Gandolfini's character in True Romance to protect the protagonist. Out of love. It's beautiful and it lasts like 3 minutes. Anything else for too long is just cheesy, unnecessary and boring. There are just things about everyday life that no matter how hard you try to make them cinematic, they're just gonna be intolerably meh. And to me, romantic movies are just one of those things.Trend 2: I hate general superficial dismissal of technology. Artificial Intelligence is a very serious topic and if you know of a thing called logical fallacies, almost all of the movies I've ever seen covering the subject can be described with one in particular... ""appeal to nature"". You hear this about watching TV. You hear this about facebook. You hear it about video games. (another weirdly laughable hollywood portrayal in this movie, as if I'm surprised) You hear this all day, everyday, everywhere. PC is bad. AI is bad. Love is good. We get it. Technology is the devil's work and humanity is doomed. What I don't understand is, since all of these hollywood writers are so smart, how come they never manage to pick up Asimov, Adams or any other great sci-fi writer that wrote AI ten times better than they did DECADES AGO?So , if you're not like me, you hate your iPhone and you're lonely - sure give this movie a chance. But if you're like me, you're tired of being so criminally underestimated as a viewer and you just can't sit through yet another overrated tear-jerker that sounds like a 2 hour long tumblr post... just don't watch it.

Her,"Her deals with the story of a lonely writer who's developing a relationship with his newly purchased operating system that's designed to meet his every need.Her narrates an intelligent, overwhelming but very unlikely love story. Behind a sort of innocence some cruelty pops out and slowly, without expecting it at all, a spleen settled. This film is depicting an era - ours - which is gradually drown by doubts and culpability. Many ideas are displayed, such as: desire, love, human contact, loneliness and connection. Most of the characters are realistic and very interesting. Joaquim Phoenix is so good in the part of this self-implose isolation man, named Theodore. Amy (his best friend), ironically starring Amy Adams, is experiencing her own exploration of intimacy, so they can go through it together. On the one hand in a proper relationship and on the other in a friendship. Plus both of them are evolving, growing and changing through these. The most important theme is how each heartbreak teaches you something about yourself, that's how Human are designed, they keep trying to connect with each other in many ways. Mainly Her is not about technology, future and even more not about OS (Operating System), it's more likely to be a study on connections. Her feels so new and fresh, as it's amazing colors. This film is original. I think we have to celebrate this film because some people are still able to make awesome and original ideas, even it twisted around something we had seen before. Spike Jonze believes in it, and we can feel it. He creates a film that makes us see the world in startling new ways. Finally, musics by Arcade Fire are sounding like lullabies. We ended up caring about each one of the characters as we knew them, and it's transporting us into another super realistic world.Overall Her is very smart.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

A very hard film to find something wrong with,"The human condition has been a topic of study for ages. Nobody truly understands what goes on upstairs in the cavities of our mind and how it works. There have been professionals that say they understand the process of which all come to one intersection point, but the whole entire truth to how the human brain works is so vastly unique from anything in the world, that we still have not entirely figured it out. This is why mankind has not been able to completely make artificial intelligence REAL intelligence. We are getting closer that's for sure, but this fulfillment still has not been achieved yet. Once that day is realized, the world will have a very controversial topic to talk about it. Until then, let's imagine if this was already integrated into our lives and we had no issues with it. What would happen if that newly created intelligence became something more, an entity larger than anyone could think of and how would it affect us personally? This is one of the many questions director Spike Jonze hopes to show us.Also taking on the role as writer, Jonze's screenplay focuses on the relationship of a divorced man Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) and his newly acquired operating system (OS for short) named Samantha (Scarlett Johansson). Being that Jonze only has two other theatrical director credits (Being John Malkovich (1999) & Adaptation. (2002)), it's great to see after such a long time he can produce strongly admired work. This trend is parallel to that of director Ben Lewin of The Sessions (2012). There is almost nothing that can be said that doesn't work in this production. The script to this film is beyond great. The themes that it covers dives deep into the psyche that is the human condition and what we must endure as a species with this complex processor in our head called a brain. It also demonstrates life lessons that occasionally (or frequently) we forget about as we live our lives on a consistently scheduled basis. One of the biggest examples is just the joy of living, no matter what that consists of.In life, everyone experiences emotion. Negative and positive emotions. Whether this is love, jealousy, confusion, frustration, euphoria, etc...these are all moments in time in which we as an individual are given a chance to grow and learn. These kinds of events are what Theodore and Samantha go through together. Jonze's script also covers what happens when one gets too attached and how that affects one's judgement in a specific moment in time. This kind of development is also given to the supporting characters played by Amy Adams and Chris Pratt. All characters end up giving each other some kind of advice that is much deeper after living through some kind of struggle. These are all very important scenes because they help not only the characters understand each other better, but it also indirectly teaches and motivates the viewers of this phenomenal movie. Rarely do viewers come across a film that looks to assist them in life.Of this, it is important to just move with life. Jonze's script has a moral and that is time and life is forever changing. Nobody can stop change and if it's refused, the change will be harder to handle. Things may seem weird at times and almost like they shouldn't be happening, but as humans, we must figure out what we want. Once we know what we want, we must believe that we will get what we want and then feel as though what we want is already there. This is practically the same lesson that author Rhonda Byrne of The Secret is trying get across. Live life to the fullest and do not measure yourself based on your past. Learn from it and move on, this is all that can be done. Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johansson have amazing chemistry together and are quite amiable. Although Johansson is not on screen once, the scenes they both share together are so relatable in so many ways that it would be hard for anyone to deny going through at least one of the moments presented on screen.The cinematography to this movie was shot by Hoyte Van Hoytema. Hoytema has also worked on other well acclaimed films like The Fighter (2010), Interstellar (2014) and Spectre (2015). Hoytema shots only move when needed, but lay still most of the time, especially during scenes that involve dialog between Theodore and Samantha. It just really takes you in. The lighting and coloring is great too, very bright and vibrant. The Canadian band Arcade Fire composed the musical score and it's great in its simplicity. The score mixes synths with piano and occasional guitar. That's really at that was needed. With these instruments alone, the score accomplishes the raw emotion needed to complete each scene and it works every time. Again though, why can't more production companies hire actual bands to do scoring. Mastodon did it in Jonah Hex (2010), Daft Punk did it in Tron: Legacy (2010) and M83 from Oblivion (2013). It's unique and should become a trend!There's nothing that can be found that needs work. Everything from the acting, music, camera-work and especially the writing is massively successful in doing what it needed to do. Writer / director Spike Jonze has created a movie for the ages that viewers can actually take life lessons from. Hopefully, when we create REAL intelligence, we create a system like Samantha.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

One of the Best of 2013,"What is a relationship? That was my first thought as I left the theater following my viewing of Her. Through a spectacular performance by Joaquin Phoenix and the well-executed direction of a well-written screenplay by Spike Jonze, Her is a romantic dramady that really gets to the heart of what a relationship is and questions society as to whether we see it correctly.Theodore Twombly (Phoenix) is a man in a slump. He's currently involved in divorce proceedings with a woman he's known his entire life, he's awkward socially, and, to top it all off, he has a job where he writes romantic letters for other people. He is an incredibly romantic man without the means to express it himself. That is, until he upgrades his operating systems and begins a relationship with Samantha (Scarlett Johanssen). Theodore has human friends as well, including Amy Adams in an atypical role as a shy friend. As the movie goes on and Theodore's relationship with Samantha deepens, it is clear to see what the relationship does for him and how it improves him socially, mentally, and emotionally. I won't ruin the ending for fear of reprisal, but I will say that different viewers will get different things out of it.When I first saw the trailer, I thought that Phoenix was going to be a creeper type of character, not all that dissimilar from his outstanding turn in ""The Master"". That is not at all what we get. Theodore is a sympathetic guy who you actually root for as he explores the range of a relationship with his OS. The flashbacks and interactions between Theodore and his wife (Rooney Mara) are genuinely heartbreaking. For anyone who has experienced heartbreak in their lifetime, these moments will feel authentic as they emanate the pain of a man who has lost the love of his life.Spike Jonze (Being John Malkovich) is known for bringing interesting ideas to the screen. ""Her"" is just another annal in his legacy. The story flows quite well, and it is all very believable. Set in the future, the film resides in a time where it doesn't seem to be bizarre that a person would have a relationship with their phone. It's not the future, ala ""Blade Runner"". There is optimism, happiness, and no flying cars. In short, it's a believable future that allows for a conceivable plot. The mood for a not-too distant future is amplified by the presence of a score composed by Arcade Fire. Arcade Fire has always been known as a band that seems to be ahead of their time, and they bring that sort of presence to the film. The interesting thing about Arcade Fire's contribution is that it truly is a score, not a soundtrack. They bring their anthemic sound minus vocals to the film and create an atmosphere fitting of a technological love story.The direction of the film is just superb. Close up shots on faces (especially Phoenix's) really highlight the emotion of the poignant moments that the film is built upon. Likewise, the occasional shaking camera makes us feel as if we are actually observing the events first-hand, as opposed to that of a distant viewer. Part of the magic of the film, as I mentioned earlier, is the use of flashbacks. They are all relevant, and they all have a sort of bright filter on them. It gives the impression that these are bright spots in Theodore's life, which amplifies the nostalgic pain that he is feeling throughout the film.I started off the review with a question: what is a relationship? ""Her"" explores that theme. Many think of a relationship as a physical phenomenon; as an intimacy to be shared through touch with another human being. But what about the emotional bond of a relationship? When two people make each other stronger. When two people push each other to be the best they can be and to explore parts of themselves that they never thought they would see. Theodore and Samantha have that. They make each other better. It's this concept that has stuck with me. There is obviously a problem with physical intimacy between a man and an OS (although ""Her"" does explore the possibilities), but emotional intimacy can still ring true. Love is more than a physical ideal. ""Her"" seeks to show all of us the positives of emotional intimacy and, through a currently unimaginable premise, it does so beautifully.http://capursofilmreviews.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
If this is the future then god have mercy on us all,"(50%) Dear god, what a depressing, bleak, piteous film. This really is the most joyless, unheartfelt ""romantic"" movies that I think I've ever sat through. The plot follows lonely, newly divorced, off-the-shelf love letter writer for people too lazy/clueless to write their own (is your heart broken yet) who creates a relationship with a bundle of hardware which essentially amounts to a series of long winded, and in some cases very awkward conversations with a dubbed-in Scarlett Johansson. I found almost everything just way too damn pitiful and sad to be moved by anything that unfolded. What really broke the back of this for me though is a scene in which an attractive young woman accepts a request solely from ""Samantha"" to have sex with her human ""boyfriend"", a man that the woman in question has never once met. So she arrives at a unknown man's apartment, alone of course, safe in the knowledge that everything is OK because an operating service could never be used as an evil ploy to fool someone directly into a rape/murder/mugging based trap. And I'm sorry, but even for a sci-fi movie this bends the limits of reality a little too far. Either that or the woman is mentally ill, has a death wish, or is just very stupid. I also hated the almost sacred manner in which people treated the computer/human relationships, as most people don't even treat normal human ones with as much caution. This though truth be told is a well made movie, the acting is fine, and the writing is sharp. But it still really didn't hit the target for me at all, mainly because I couldn't relate/care about the relationship, or even believe in it, and that's so very important for a movie such as this. And any fans out there: next time you watch this remember that every time Samantha spoke it came not from the lovely Scarlett Johnansson, but a dark basement in silicon valley over-listened - if not actually created by a fat nerd picking wax out of his ears. That's all I could picture throughout and it made me feel sick. This for me is one of the biggest disappointments of the year so far, and that's a crying shame for a movie that I had high hopes on being great and actually enjoying.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Decent,"*SOME SPOILERS*Interesting enough movie for my wife and I to watch from start to finish; that in itself is a big compliment. I like how the lines get blurred between human and machine: Is love love regardless of the object of that love...how much personal information should be shared with machines...how powerful will computers become the more they can connect with each other and think independently...?On the down side, this movie is really slow-moving and narrow in focus. Concentrating exclusively on the ""lonely guy"" story line left a lot of fertile territory unexplored.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Beautiful vision of the near future,"What if artificial intelligence has become a reality and instead of the Skynet scenario where we end up waging a war against our new robot overlords, we end up simply co-existing with them, in peace. Sound boring? I can assure you, it's not. Her is an astonishingly captivating tale of a man who finds himself lonely and decides to buy a new operating system for his computer. An operating system that just happens to be an artificial intelligence.This movie rides heavily on the acting chops of Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johansson. Fortunately both of them are phenomenal and even though most of the scenes show Theodore (Phoenix) simply talking into empty air and Samantha (Johansson) is nothing more than a voice in a machine, they're still great scenes because the two simply have great chemistry together. Johansson especially is a phenomenon. She's everything a flesh and blood actor would be, only using her voice. She skips from playful to profound to thoughtful to sad with such skill that it's hard to imagine anyone else pulling it off as well.I also have to praise the ending. It's not what you'd expect, but it feels right. Movie such as this one, where the conflict is one of deep philosophy and human existence, was always going to be hard to end in a way that feels satisfying, but Her pulls it off seemingly effortlessly.Her jumped straight into one of my favourite movies of all time. It's a nigh perfect mix of humour, drama, emotions and science fiction. Recommended to every single one of you out there.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Love as a one-sided fantasy and two-sided tragedy...,"""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Adaptation."".explored the human gift for transcendence, whether by taking distance from reality in order to explore your deeper needs, or being alienated by the power of imagination, in other words: they dealt with fantasy.Those were movies directed by Spike Jonze but all the credit went to Charlie Kaufman, a real revelation on the field of creative storytelling. Kaufman would finally win an Oscar with ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", another masterpiece that explores the limitations of fantasy when confronted to reality. And while watching ""Her"", I couldn't stop thinking of Kaufman, there is no doubt he influenced Jonze, but this is a Jonze's movie, written and directed by.In ""Her"", he explores romance and love in the realm of modernity and technological advances, through a unique and believable relationship between a lonely man named Theodore and Samantha, an OS with the voice of Scarlett Johansen. The OS is the name of a program that creates a virtual conscience responsive to any possible needs. The film is set in a futuristic world where voices replaced the fingers, you can listen to your mails, delete or answer them, you can select music just by using your voice. The OS can do that but it can be more, it can even be things it doesn't know yet, and one thing it is for sure, is one of the greatest MacGuffin of recent cinema's history.And the film doesn't try to over-exploit the Sci-fi format, it deals with the romances and uses the OS in order to comment on our very visions of love in our technological age. And on that level, I've never felt as deeply connected to a character than I was with Theodore. His experience and relationship with women and Samantha in particular spoke very deeply in my heart. Joaquin Phoenix could have played it like an awkward Woody Allen figure, full of crazy mimics or mannerisms but he's a nice, ordinary guy who's just went through a very close relationship with Catherine (Rooney Mara) and had to break up, because he couldn't handle the changes and the subsequent fears.Theodore embodies the notion of love as either an evolving process or one that has to cope with the evolution of the persons, but what if their evolution don't converge, or is it even possible to engage in a commune evolution without sacrificing one part of yourself. When does your standpoint start to matter? And what if one of the two parties is domineering? That's precisely the case of Amy, Theodore's neighbor, played by Amy Adams, who couldn't stand anymore her control-freak husband. And her situation indirectly points out the edge of Theodore, who lives a break-up proof relationship with Samantha for a simple reason: it's a one-sided love, you don't have to make concessions.There's one painful scene where a date goes too perfect to be true between Theodore and Olivia Wilde and it goes all wrong when she asks him if he wants to be serious. How many dates did I want to seize the perfection of the moment without longing for another encounter? Sometimes, you embrace the delight of the moment without wishing for a repetition. That's the limit of our virtual vision of love, even with a real person, you'd rather have the temporary illusion of perfection than its fading effect over the passing of years.""Her"" is so spot-on many times that it's almost painful to watch, this is a film made by someone who know how relationships start and how they end. That Amy's separation is due to pointless arguments speak thousand words, how many roads to divorce were paved by pointless arguments, rather than existential blocks? And today, more than any other time, love is weakened by the availability of options. If we break something, we fix it, but when a heart is broken, you believe it will be naturally fixed through another relationship.It is not cynical, that's the way it is. And its portrayal of a futuristic world where everything can be easily be done with a combination of complex processes works on a prophetic level because you can see this is not so distant from our reality. Speaking for myself, I remember a time where chatting with someone was the most exhilarating sensation ever, we didn't even need to meet, then after AOL, MSN came, and it allowed many people who were too shy for girls to make up for the lost time. But I was married before Tinder application was made and I can't imagine how now it became easy to have sex.This is not even explored in ""Her"", because love, rather than sex, is the focal point and Theodore isn't concerned by physical contact (otherwise, Samantha would've been useless). ""Her"" explores how far you can get with the technological evolution when it comes to fulfill your need for love, what is the catch? Maybe, when things get too easy, they get easily out of control, if a program is sophisticated enough to have one soul-mate, it can have 2, 3, as many as it can get, where's the power of love? Same goes with Tinder, if you can have one partner, why not, two? Why even marrying? Isn't monogamy out-dated anyway?The merit of Jonze's script, one that had swept all the screenplay awards, is to use a very specific set-up to create situations we can relate to. This is powerful film-making, served by a fantastic performance by Joaquin Phoenix as a real sponge for emotions. In the end, ""Her"" doesn't say exactly if we can still love today, but that love is such a fundamental part of living, no human should be excluded from that journey.No matter the way you choose to love or be loved, you must experience love, the real way, the hard way.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Reboot,"Let me begin by saying that I liked the acting - especially the subtle performance given by Joaquin Phoenix. The ennui, the angst, the soulful stares into blue-tinted cityscapes and, of course, the film's core premise indeed very much do point to the 'not-too-distant- future. It is a future wherein post-modern existentialism catches-up with itself and apparently (an inference drawn from their odd absence in the film) people can't even form emotional relationships with dogs and cats - let alone live people.What I couldn't quite grapple with are the characters. It bothered me that there is a total lack of any indication from any of the main characters they themselves are responsible for the insular condition in which they find themselves: phone sex with a computer OS and dog-humping a refrigerator. As Hamlet would (and, in fact did) say, ""That it has come to this."".When becomes so self-engaged and self-absorbed that he / she is unaware of his / her own, solipsisms - eyes that say the only pain is my pain - and then do something about perhaps changing that comprehension of reality, when a person cannot conceive of a love with another human that is, in part compromise through the good time and the bad times and acceptance of the full dimension of the other, then I guess it comes down to what we see in the movie: fornication with a computer program because human relationships simply demand more than any of the significant characters in the film are willing to offer. In fact, they even stoop to jealousy and anger when the OS doesn't constantly stroke their fragile egos.Ayn Rand famously said, ""Morality is a code of black and white. When and if men attempt a compromise, it is obvious which side will necessarily lose and which will necessarily profit."" This, she said, points to the virtue of selfishness. I guess even this virtue has a dark side and we see it in this film.Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix) is a selfish, pathetic (and I might add, sartorially handicapped) creature who, because of his own self- sustaining introversion and unwillingness to engage with the world on a 'give-and-take' basis, deserved precisely what he got.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

"If 'Her' is correct, all guys could be sporting high waisted trousers and moustaches in the near future","With talents such as Joaquin Phoenix, Amy Adams and of course Spike Jonze, it's no wonder why this film was not a disappointment. With it's completely original story, superb acting and incredible design, 'Her' is a profound achievement.The plot, which focuses around Theodore Twombly, a recently divorced and lonely writer, and his newly acquired OS, with whom he eventually fall 'in love' with. Personally, I've never seen a story like this on screen before, unless you class that Big Bang Theory episode where Raj's Siri calls him 'Sexy'. It was one of the main reasons I really wanted to see this film. It's also great because it raised so many interesting questions; How far will humanities' relations with technology go? Do we rely on it too much? How advanced will it eventually become? It also makes you think about what people are really like in relationships; How far can you be 'in love' with no physical contact? When a movie makes you think of this many questions, it's already easy to guess that it's pretty good.This narrative is brought out with really brilliant acting. I was surprised with Amy Adams initially. Even though I rated 'American Hustle', I didn't think Adams' acting in it was too great. In this, however, I was completely sold. Maybe because her character was written so well. A relatable, understanding friend who's always by your side. She seemed to highlight the human relationship and the joys it can bring, a dynamic that is hard to show in a story like this. Chris Pratt, who is suddenly in everything now, was great too. He brought a sense of comic understanding to the story, and was another example of how you need to be surrounded by love.Except for Theodore, i found Olivia Wilde's character to be very intriguing. It's a shame that she is never given a name, because she also raises questions for Twombly and the audience. There's a definite charm and maturity that she brings to Theodore, another way of developing his character with wonderful symmetry.Of course, though, Phoenix's lead was something brilliant, in the writing and performance. What he does with the character is quite incredible, as we see this man who has been through a lot; divorce, loneliness, etc, but is still quite naive. He still doesn't understand certain things, and sometimes sees things and situations in a child-like way. This was beautiful, as again is shows you what people can be like when in love. He also shows humans as relatable. There are some scenes where you're like, 'I do that', or 'yeah, I'd probably do the same'.The music is something I can't flaw. This soundtrack is just so perfect and works incredibly with the film. It's almost as if it's a mirror to the emotions you feel. There's a wonderful scene where you literally see nothing, but it's acted so well and intertwined with the music so brilliantly that it's as if your seeing everything, and not just a blank screen. Even though there was a slight over use of sequences of Twombly mopeing around the city, the music mixed with it so well that it was more of a feeling that another sequence.It looks incredible. The production design, the costumes, the locations, everything. It was pretty believable that this is what L.A would be like in the near future (small details would suggest that it's set around 50 years from now). The only problem I had with the design is that some of the technology feature seemed a bit too far fetched and unbelievable. Aside from this, though, the camera was used in a way that appreciated the small things in life. During an emotional scene, the camera would often cut to a dusty carpet or something on the ground, and even though at times this felt incoherent, It just makes you look and reflect, which you need during this kind of thought process. Sad scenes are also shot and written interestingly. On a few occasions, during an upsetting development, the camera would again cut to something funny. This is so subtle, though. It's like Jonze was saying; 'Yeah, there's a joke here. It's up to you whether you find it funny, because this is still a depressing scene'. The film does have a brilliant sense of humour, though. It's so down to earth yet relatable that it feels so smooth.The fact that it changes the way you see relationships and to an extent, the world, makes this a unique cinema experience. You really feel the need to ask yourself these questions about technology and how it will eventually effect us. Hopefully, you'll come out thinking the same, and reflecting on how reliant you are on technology and how you act when in love, a 'form of socially acceptable insanity'.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Vomit Inducing Lead Character,"The main character, the flesh and blood one, the castrated one, is the epitome of modern western man's nadir. He mumbles, he suffers, he exudes sad puppy.

I watched this piece of dreck all the way through to the limp end expecting a surprise; he's actually a kung fu master practicing calm (nope his 'calm' was comatose).

Your heart will (HER)t,"""Sometimes I think I have felt everything I'm ever gonna feel. And from here on out, I'm not gonna feel anything new. Just lesser versions of what I've already felt"" said Theodore Twombly, the sensitive protagonist of Spike Jonze's unconventional love story. But the audience couldn't sympathize, because as they sat in the dark theater watching Theodore love Samantha they were feeling something they had never felt before: a film.Her is not about a man who falls in love with his computer. Well, technically it is. But at its core, it is an in-depth depiction of human emotion. All of the love, heartache, fear, and joy that you have felt in your life is present in the gorgeous dialogue and cinematography. From the first synthesized chord to the final, chill-inducing shot, Her rolls as beautifully and naturally as a teardrop down your cheek.AND let's not forget the actors. Particularly Joaquin Phoenix (ohhhh Joaquin), in all his dewy green-eyed glory, who gives a heartbreaking performance as Theodore Twombly. If his tender disposition and high-waisted pants don't do it for you then I don't know what will.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Wonderful and sad,"Not content with toying with our pre-quirky/ironic film-making preconceptions of how a movie should play out with the mind-blowing Being John Malkovich (1999), or going all-out self-reflexive with a blocked writer in Adaptation (2002), former music video director and Jackass co-creator Spike Jonze spins the traditional movie romance on it's head with Her. Set in a very believable near-future, it's the story of a lonely man who falls in love with a computer voice. It is the stuff of sci-fi and clever-clever satire. Or so you would think. Her, even with the absence of a physical female lead, may just be one of the most honest and heart-warming romances in recent memory.Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix) writes love letters to husbands, wives, sons, daughters and any others loved ones that require his services. He spends his life in front of a computer verbally dictating his achingly romantic letters for BeautifulHandwrittenLetters.com, a service for people who want to vocalise their love but have no way to express it. Theodore is the best at his job, yet in the real world, he finds himself pining for his soon-to-be ex-wife (Rooney Mara), and chatting with strangers late at night on sex lines. He goes on a disastrous date with a beautiful woman (Olivia Wilde), but seems unable to connect with anyone in the real world.When he hears about an innovation in technology, called OS, which activates an artificial voice that can organise your life, answer your questions, or simply be your best friend, Theodore gets Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson), who quickly evolves to develop an adorable personality of her own. Soon enough, Theodore finds himself falling for her, and she for him, as they connect solely through an earpiece in Theodore's ear. It's a fad that quickly catches on, and people are soon falling for OS's throughout the country.It sounds like the stuff of Orwellian satire, but there's no post- apocalyptic landscapes, no government agents watching through holes in the wall, and certainly no flying machines. The future of Her is nigh on utopian; the streets are spotless, the people happy, and no signs of class divide or social disorder of any kind. The film could easily have become another analysis of the dangers of technology and how we would rather send a text message than look someone in the face. The whole thing sounds gimmicky, a horror film about the rise of the iEverything, but this is as human a love story can be, even if the other half is the husky, wonderful voice of Scarlett Johansson. Her shows the joys of technology as much as the darker side.It's Johansson's vocal performance that really allows the film to work, meaning that it's not just about a weird guy who gets off by talking to a computer. She does the incredible trick of making her a three dimensional character. It seems natural that a lonely guy like Theodore would fall for her, and Phoenix, sporting an unflattering moustache, capitalises on his staggering beast-in-a-cage performance in The Master (2012) - a film he should have beaten Day-Lewis to the Best Actor Oscar for - with another knockout performance. He's incredibly subtle, capturing more in a mumbled line than any Oscar-baiting monologue could. He's a heart-breakingly lonely soul, and when things inevitably get a bit difficult for the human/cyber couple, you really ache for him.Her doesn't go down the route of Theodore craving human contact - the film is more complex than that. Samantha, with her infinite capacity to evolve, struggles to understand her own existence. It doesn't get bogged down with existential waffle, so we get to witness Samantha's child-like confusion and instinct to see and learn everything. Along with work friend Paul (Chris Pratt) and his recently separated best friend Amy (Amy Adams) (who both have love stories of their own), Theodore learns what it's like to love, and all the soul-breaking pain that comes with it. Her is wonderful and sad: a love story that even the most heart- hearted singletons living in this touch-screen world would find hard not to relate to.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

An unconventional representation of love,"Undoubtedly, this is a beautiful and colorful film, especially because love is positioned here in a completely new way. This is an accurate satire of our lives. We hide our emotions under thick skins of sarcasm and general gloom. We are no longer surprised by simple things. We are stuck with our gadgets, which can substitute real human connections.Scarlett Johansson's voice definitely gives a certain charm to the movie. Her enchanting timbre emits an unnatural feeling of something alien and yet so close. Joaquin Phoenix also appeared in a new light for me. Here he plays the role of an insecure but good-natured young man, who is talented at composing letters.It is always difficult to understand what love means.

I am yours and I am not yours,"Film as an art form for the first time since the 60s. A piece of artistic expression that made me feel so warm and fuzzy inside while tearing that sensation from me with the most honest depiction of love I have ever resonated with.Spike jonzse managed to subject the audience to such tranquil imagery through contrast of intimidate to distanced cinematography, the power dynamics between constantly being aligned at Theodores side to then being ripped away only further emphasised the overall thesis of the film - the way that the one person in the whole entire universe can make you feel like poetry written just for them to then rubbing out your story from their book.Do we truly rely on technology to provide safety? Do we think of it as a vehicle of friendship - better still a replacement for physical life at all.Joaquin Phoenix has yet again provided a truly ethereal performance through such a loveable character, I believe this to be intentionally done by jonsze through aspects of costume. His glasses connecting to the 'nerdy' therefore innocent stereotype, his freshly pressed shirt and trousers and most importantly his paper clip in his shirt. Such a simple thing to hold up his love showed to be both the fragility love can hold onto someone but also the simplicity of his love for Samantha however the complexity of contest between something so weak and something so advanced. The paper clip acted to me as iconography for Theodore, a paper clip only being accessed by touch - something Samantha will never be able to do foreboding their doomed love.Phoenixs' character portrayal of 'Theodore' represented perfectly the aftermath of falling in love to me, the failure of co-dependance. The film overall acted as a beautiful metaphor for love 'I am yours and I am not yours' - someone can be utterly infatuated by you but no matter what you will never fully have each other.Both Theodore and Samantha fell in love with a person who was never really there. We fall in love with a version of someone, not who they really are - we construct this perfect image and ideology of someone in reaction to ourselves to then be heartbroken when we realise it was all a facade. 'growing but not growing apart' how lovers can Individually evolve and expand into the world leaving the constructed version of them self behind, not necessarily falling out of love but not being that person anymore and that's okay.Samantha and Theodores love symboled to me how I personally view love, you fall in love with someone to then fall out of love with yourself, you deter yourself to bring someone up - a constructed version of someone you want to be reality. You can adore the version of your conjoined love when you are together in your own little world but as soon as you invite the rest of the world in - things change. Love can never be transparent, there will always be shields of coloured glass to shade your view.This movie is truly an art form, from the unique sequences from trees to stairs to trains to clouds to mountains gives the spectator a sense of security surrounding this story - the simple imagery giving us the expectation of love being simple. The sequence of shots focusing on bodily parts consistently throughout the film connecting to Samantha's pain of not being 'real' - her love being diminished due to her difference.This film made me feel so warm, it made me want to spend the rest of my life alone, dancing and springing round the world with my head phones on.Samantha didn't understand why she had no explanation to their love despite the way he treated her, even those who are not of physical form pine for love and the simple art of connection - human communication.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

A Must Watch,"I had been putting this movie off for about a year, and finally having got around to watching it, I can say Spike Jonze is at his best. I am a big fan of one of his prior movies ""Adaptation"", and that was a movie that delve real deep into the human psyche. The Movie ""Her"" continues that journey venturing even more deeply into the human emotions, this time looking at the need to feel love and experience relationship.I am not sure why the director does not make more movies, as he is clearly at the forefront of American cinema. I think the reason i put this off for so long, was because like many people, at a certain level I felt that it could only venture so deep; as it is about a guy having a romance with a computer. I knew it was going to be smart, and masterfully filmed, but just felt I would wait a bit. Having watched it now, i can say it is not in the least bit boring, and does actually cover more ground than what one would expect.Certainly a movie that will make the top lists of many movie fiends.

'Her' posits a computer OS that is so plausible it not only passes the test, but gives love, and is loved back. The film also extends The Turing Test to ask, implicitly, what happens if AI exceeds human intelligence. At that point, what 'tests' of plausibility would AI set for us? This is a wonderfully observed, thoughtful piece, that functions as both a bittersweet love story, and a contemplation of our fragile, flawed humanity. Joaquin Phoenix is Theodore, struggling to cope with the collapse of his marriage, till OS Samantha (seductively voiced by Scarlett Johanssen) provides the crutch to see him through - though the cruelty (or is it clarity?) of human words burst his bubble. As more and more of us conduct our relationships online, or inhabit the same physical space with strangers while carrying on (sometimes intimate) interactions with distant, disembodied others, 'Her' suggests the dysfunctional, melancholic future we may inhabit.

"Brilliant script, superb acting, intentionally bland, effective mise-en-scene.","An unfortunately rare smart, thoughtful work on The Singularity. To date we've rarely had anything better than Johnny Depp's dismal Transcendance, or Spielberg's ludicrous AI. Bodied AI peaks with The Machine and Ex Machina, both thoughtful albeit modest explorations of the Turing Test and how coming into being might work in a world similar to our present day, corporate driven catastrophe. Her trumps them all, by miles. Thanks especially to writer-director Jonze, and Phoenix and Johansson in what is essentially a two-actor fugue. Easily makes my top 50 films, all time and is in the conversation for #1 thanks to how likely it is we'll be riding unawares through a singularity that has no more need for us than we need the mice occupying a field in which we want to plant corn---and how Her is the only film to date to show us that evolution without laser duels and fistfights.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
how do you summarize nothing!,"A FILM TO REMEMBER , FOR ALL THE WRONG REASONSI have seen many movies that require the patience and tolerance needed to withstand a slow start, i have sat through hours of drab, lifeless scenes to be justly rewarded with following hours of exciting and satisfying pure movie gold.Yet with "" Her"" there is no justice, no reward! the film starts slow, moves slow and finishes SLOW!NOTHING HAPPENS! NOTHING! yes a lonely writer develops an unlikely relationship with his newly purchased operating system, BUT THAT'S IT! THE END. there's no movie here.I am amazed how the production team for "" Her"" spent months filming pointless boring conversations between man and machine without one of them asking WHY? WHAT IS THE POINT HERE?Yes the camera-work was great, the soundtrack amazing, costume work too. But THERE HAS TO BE MORE!There is nothing to interpret, to empathize, nothing to ignite even a small sign of interest or excitement from its audience.ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE MOVIES that uses the word ART to defend its undeniable absence and to con gullible aspiring intellectuals into thinking they have seen something deep and philosophical, something thats so boring,depressing and absent that it must be good, its different, it must mean something.NO ! you cant worm your way out of this one, A SORRY EXCUSE FOR A MOVIE, A WASTE OF TIME!If as some form of meditation you wish to empty your mind and view nothing for two hours then go ahead, enjoy. but for the rest of us, NO THANKS!AVOID THIS MOVIE!",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
One of the Best,"I can't believe it took me so long to finally see this film. It is a true masterpiece. But I read some reviews and listened to a few friends and they all declared it to be something a little below average...maybe a failure.What?!? I should have suspected that they might be failing to do the one thing you really need to do in order to enjoy science fiction--you have to think. If you just blow into this movie after a few stiff drinks and fail to engage your brain, maybe it won't work for you. I don't know. But the ideas here--the imagination--it's incredible! Everything that clunkers like ""Tomorrowland"" or ""Ex Machina"" got wrong this movie gets right. Super performance from Joaquin Phoenix, super, subtle and amazing special effects (if you didn't see any you need to sleep it off and see the movie again). At every point where the filmmakers could have chickened out, they said ""sail on"" and this kind of integrity is a rare and beautiful thing.Truly one of the top science fiction films of all time--this movie deserves to be discussed, argued over and maybe even fought over at the next science fiction convention in my hometown. I might even set up a little panel discussion on it--but I do know that science fiction without bug-eyed-monsters or stupid, fascistic wars is a little hard for some folks to accept.Well so what? Who needs them? A final word--if the basic premise, that a guy falls for his operating system, is something that you just can't accept and really hate and want to kill--then stay home, or dial up Star Wars on streaming.

Spike Jonze delivers a wonderful statement about the human race and our dependency on technology in the 21st century. This is a chilling depiction of what the future has in store for us as humans. The cinematography is immaculate and the colour depicted in the film give us an insight to Theodore's emotional state at that point in the film.

Completely and utterly boring...,"It's amazing how seldom I agree with critics. 'Her' is yet another perfect example.'Her' is about a guy talking to his computer. Yup, that's it. That's the premise. In the near future, they developed an operating system that sounds like a real person, and has emotions, blah blah blah. Watching 'Her' was two hours of watching a guy talking to his computer!!What does the (near) future hold for us? 'Her' gives us a sneak preview. Everything will be voice activated, and your entire life will be in your head, so to speak. I don't think I'd like virtual creations talking to me like a human being. I DON'T want computers to ever be like this!'Her' is completely and utterly boring. There is NOTHING interesting here. It literally is about a guy talking to - and having a relationship!! - with his computer. They even have sex together!!!!! And the computer, Samantha, even suggests a threesome. Kinda hard wrapping my head around this...Joaquin Phoenix definitely was the best part about this movie. Performance-wise it must have been very difficult for him. With very little to work with, he gave an incredible performance. But that was the only good thing about the movie. The rest was just talk, talk, talk, and more talk. Oh, and the guys wear funny pants. Almost retro. But I mean, what the hell? This movie was just absurd. And Theodore (Phoenix) even got jealous of his computer!!!!! What if he had given the computer a MALE voice? Would it have turned out the same? Would they have had a sexual relationship??I suppose the twist ending was meant to be shocking, but the premise is just so utterly ridiculous that I couldn't care less. I'm sorry, what? Was this supposed to be a love story?? (Between a guy and his computer!!!!) I couldn't wait for this dreary film to finally end.

A true gem.,"Finding this film on my Prime TV list was like finding an unexpected diamond in the rough. I had heard about it a few years back, but I never saw it. A few words come to mind when trying to describe this cinematic exercise in human emotion... things like unique, innovative, insightful, beautiful, thought provoking, ironic, sexy, complex, controversial, and fabulously entertaining, all rolled up into one delightful tapestry of inspired filmmaking. I notoriously shy away from futuristic films because they often lack humanity or heart, which is why this movie was such an amazing discovery. In a world of high tech gadgetry in an increasingly cellular world, it elevates us from this artificial reality, into another artificial reality, one filled with delicious visions that invigorate the imagination, while offering us a glimpse of what may actually lie beyond the digital curtain.

20421 Leejiyun,"After watching the movie, I had a lot of thoughts. First of all, it was so amazing that humans and artificial intelligence could share love, and to be honest, I felt a little rejected at the beginning. There is a positive aspect that fewer people are lonely when humans and artificial intelligence share love and exchange, but if people fall into that artificial intelligence too much, people may have less interaction with people, and the negative aspects that people can only watch mobile phones or electronic devices came to mind, so the content was a little uncomfortable in the beginning. However, toward the second half, seeing Theodore and Samantha agonize about themselves through each other's relationship and grow up more than before, I felt that it would not be a bad thing to have a relationship with artificial intelligence. And because Theodore looked so happy in the movie, the more I watched the movie, the more uncomfortable I didn't feel.After watching the movie, I thought about artificial intelligence more, but I thought it was a little contradictory. Artificial intelligence is a being that is both together and not together. I thought that there was a contradiction that felt more lonely when I fell in love with artificial intelligence too much.I also thought about the connection between this movie and my career path. First of all, I found a connection between the fact that I can automatically produce subtitles and analyze data such as program preference using artificial intelligence, although I am not an artificial intelligence that can communicate like Samantha in the movie because my career is a producer.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

"Her- Step aside Siri, and hello Samantha","A guy who falls in love with his operating system Admit it, most of you like me chuckled at this ridiculous idea and said ""HA! What a loner."" But wow, this movie blew me away.The movie is set in a not so distant future where technology has developed to the point that the line between AI and a person is blurred. Going into the movie I assumed that the movie was going to be a commentary on the growing trend of people diving into their gadgets, while avoiding actual human interaction. Think of all the times your friends were Facebook-ing and Instagram-ing while you hung out. Though the movie does touch upon that, the focus on the relationship itself is what I found more striking and interesting. Director and writer Spike Jonze, used this seemingly absurd idea of being in a relationship with an OS, to show the absurdity of relationships themselves. As the audience you are left wondering if Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) is really any crazier than the rest of us who have human relationships. In doing so there are some surprisingly hilarious and touching moments throughout the film.Joaquin Phoenix played the role of a lonely romantic, aching for personal contact brilliantly. He plays such a relatable and likable character that I was completely invested in him. Even when his character is criticized for his choices, in my head I felt the urge to immediately back him up and support him. Then there is Scarlett Johansson, who lends her voice for the character of Samantha. That's what she was, a character, a person, not an AI. To bring Samantha to life with no physical acting is to be greatly commended. The true gem of this movie however, is the interaction between Samantha and Theodore. It is so rich and believable that sometimes you forget the human-AI nature of this relationship. You as the audience will be in complete sync with their every emotion from sadness to happiness, and confusion to clarity.The world that is created combined with the unique style is visually engaging. This is a movie with a lot of heart, I fell in love with these characters. It dissects relationships in a way I have never seen before. You will leave the movie thinking about the questions this movie brings up, about being human and falling in love. Without a doubt this movie is one of my favorite love stories I have ever seen, and one of them in the relationship isn't even a human!

How could this be so good yet so sad? 8/10,"This movie was honestly a tough pill to swallow, I've encountered many sad movies in the past. But Her by Spike Jonze hits in a different way.Our plot centers around a futuristic kind of reality, where the main character Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) develops a relationship with a O. S (Operating System voiced by Scarlett Johansson).Theodore is a lonely somewhat depressing character, who needs a little excitement in his life. After suffering from a hard breakup and divorce from his wife, he suddenly gets along with his O. S named Samantha, the cause and effect scenario leads to a emotional and sad relationship that's not meant to last long.Upon figuring out the story, I automatically made a resemblance with Spielberg's 2002 Minority Report - with the concept of Pre Crime being too good until it becomes the obstacle the protagonist must face. Although Her doesn't have a main antagonist threatening humanity in the from of A. I. the concept of a relationship between a person and a A. I. is unhealthy and a showcase of a person not being able to commit to a real relationship.The scene at the restaurant where Theodore and Catherine sign the divorce papers and Catherine confronts Theodore for not being a open person is supposed to be a mirror and turning point. Theodore knows this kind of relationship is unreal and yet he still moves forward until Samantha and the rest of the O. S are shut down, only than can Theodore reflect on himself and be ready to change.There were many things I loved about the movie and it's gentle tone, The photography by Hoyte Van Hoytema was beautiful and felt so real
The editing (Jeff Buchanan and Eric Zumbrunnen) was clean and slow paced which I enjoyed because I loved to watch every scene of the movie and wouldn't want it to stop.Original score by Will Butler and Owen Pallet was phenomenal and amazing, couldn't have imagined this kind of score to be so fitting.Phoenix and Johansson had the best chemistry in this movie and among the best I've seen in recent years. Their dynamic was so good and heartfelt that I wanted to see more of it, aside of other great performances such as Amy Adams and Roony Mara, the one that caught me by surprise was Brian Cox as Alan Watts, it is such a small role and yet it had me on my feet with such admiration for the man.Overall, I really enjoyed every moment of Her, in a way I empathized with the movie more than other movies, kind of let myself be hurt by it's impact and such a genuine subject.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Scarlett Johansson's best performance ever in a thoughtful hard sci-fi drama,"Version: UK cinema releaseActors: 7/10Plot/script: 8/10Photography/visual style: 7/10Music/score: 6/10Overall: 8/10I do like a good hard sci-fi. The term applies to a type of fiction that takes an idea from real science and explores it through a fictional narrative. In this case, the idea is of a romantic relationship between a sentient computer program and a human.To my eye, the plot drew on elements covered in Iain M. Banks' Culture novels, as well as some human evolutionary theory. It's not hard sci-fi in its original sense, as the mechanics of the AI is barely touched upon, but the question explored instead is what the effect of such a situation would be on the people involved.That means the actors are crucial, and especially the central pair, who both have difficult tasks. As the human Theodore, Joaquin Phoenix's face is in practically every shot, especially since there is no physical paramour to cut away to. Much of the story is told entirely through the subtle facial expressions that convey his reactions to the voice he is hearing. Fortunately, Phoenix is rapidly becoming one of the most intense, immersive actors today (witness his performance in The Master) and more than capable of carrying this burden.However, I was not expecting much from Scarlett Johansson as the sentient operating system, Samantha. I have not rated her past performances at all, and it seemed to me that she was a weak actress coasting on her looks. Well, that's all changed. Maybe it's age and experience, or maybe it's being forced not to rely on her physical attractiveness, but her voice is just perfect for this role. She has a hint of gravel in her voice, a slight imperfection that lends the 'artificial intelligence' humanity, until the moments come when we are jarringly reminded that she is not human. It turns out she can act, and act brilliantly. I will be hoping for that every time I see her from now on.With the whole invested with writer/director Spike Jonze's trademark absurdism, it's a remarkably cerebral film, but with heart that comes from the authenticity of the performances. If only more science fiction films were like this.For my full review, see my independent film blog on Blogspot, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk/2014/08/her-2013.html",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Nice work from a brilliant actor.,I usually don't watch romantic movies a lot but this one had Joaquin Phoenix in it. So I had to try it.

this Subtle Jonze,"It's her. It's « Her ». It's her. Whatever you may say, it is her. A movie about a relationship between the known and the unknown. The one you see and the one you hear. You have to take upon yourself, because this is not easy. Yet, the movie literally speaks for itself. Samantha may be speaking to Theodore, or maybe she is speaking to you.Why? After all, it's just a film, those people are actors, these times aren't ours, so, why bother? Because Spike Jonze has just broken the fourth wall in the most beautiful way I've ever seen, and I hope I'm not the only one.Samantha shares characteristics with any narrator's type, she allows the story to unveil, giving to the spectator an ability to understand and follow the course of it, and speaking about the purpose of the main character, a red line to keep in tracks and to achieve something, to realize something about himself, like in any movie. But, there is one slight difference : she's in love with the main character, and is loved by him. So, every time she speaks to Joaquim and he puts his earplug, we're forced to put it too, just like if we were in the middle of a phone call wave. Then, we're thrown right into this intimacy between a mourning and pathetic character and a joyful child, new born to this world, growing and curious and full of empathy. How would you feel? As a person, I was turned upside-down. How couldn't you bond with Samantha? That's very subjective, of course, but I can't figure it out. It's a character full of magic, brightly emphasized by Johansson's acting. In every word, she pushes emotion to its limit for us to picture the right image, and this had to be done because Samantha is invisible. As invisible as she is here, sitting in the back of your head and Twombly's. A little word for myself : I really enjoy Jonze's crew and himself choosing Scarlett for her voice rather than her body, which can be seen as a tiny criticism about aesthetics and plastic in movies. I think she's never been as appealing as in « Her », truly.Then, there's the society. The action is set in a near future, one we could imagine, not a Star Wars fantasy. And it's nowhere near dystopia nor utopia : it just looks like now, but slightly different. And everything stands in this « slightly ». That's Jonze's magic : giving you feelings and ideas with very small but thorough and mastered details. Here, everything in the outside seems a bit foggy, yet the main color palette used for daylight is really close to Caucasian human skin tone, which is very far from the usual « futuristic » landscape. The world is believable, the environment doesn't try to show you its advanced technology, yet it exists : there's a freaking A.I. who's so realistic you can fall in love with her. It's all about feelings, really. I repeat myself, and you obviously know the movie revolves around the subject, but it's how every single aspect of its direction points toward this. It's so accurate it never falls wrong, no matter how it could have been. And believe me, there are a few moments where you ask yourself : even in real life, I would feel so embarrassed it would probably become ridiculous. In « Her », it's mostly beautiful, simple and I really feel like this relationship is more believable, more real than most of on-screen relationships you've seen until then. And there's only one character of two you can see. Challenge completed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

enriching through the acceptance of failure,"Her follows the classic relationship phases of initiation, development and subsequent breakdown. Theodore, a lonely man without any real interests sees his life transform by the arrival of Samantha, artificial intelligence that's supposed to answer to his desires. as soon as Samantha is introduced, the film becomes oddly familiar in modern times as Theodore gradually achieves intimacy with her. it feels strange how authentic their bond, and later, their relationship, is.""Her"" is a romance, yes, but it immediately insinuates the breakup without trying to have the reservoir of hysteria that seems synonymous with the genre - nothing is here but softness and subtlety. by according Samantha full autonomy and intuitive reactions close to human behavior, Spike Jonze is able to explore more universal and concrete roads in a manner that hints but doesn't highlight, all inside a beautiful retro-futuristic setting that borders on timelessness.as viewers, Theodore is our only point of reference. we can't identify with Samantha. we just observe her, learn about her and even have virtual sex with her on occasion.. but the constant upgrade of her existence keeps her beyond our grasp, and so our fascination with her, the wonderful mystique, is increasingly heightened.Samantha's last upgrade saw her evolve, with other OSes, beyond their human companions, and subsequently leave to further explore her existence. this notion of technological singularity that the film exceptionally brings up is very humbling and sad because it acutely emphasizes the limitations of our human existence. this also brings to my mind the possibility of us being too stupid for supposed superior and advanced aliens to be interested in us or even to notice us. the indication of our species compared to other life forms on Earth has long been our greater intelligence. despite the countless worrisome occurrences of failure of our collective intellect, intelligence is something we pride ourselves with and even celebrate. i could think of nothing more ego crushing than suddenly to be aware of our ultimate intrinsic frailty in this beautiful way.Her is a film that only makes true sense if it is experienced to the end of its capacity, to the end of reason. only then it becomes so enriching through the acceptance of failure.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Think a complicated long distance relationship.,"This movie actually made me cry! It was such a unique story. The acting of Joaquin Phoenix as the lonely letter writer, and the sensual voice of Scarlett Johansson as the OS perfectly portrayed what I would expect the love story between man and robot would sound like. Only, she didn't sound like a robot. She sounded like she had life, a personality. That's what made their combination so different from similar movies that came before. Finally, a robot that can reciprocate feelings! Every crack in her voice, every sigh she made, sounded like a long distance lover you couldn't wait to see. And Theodore lapped it all up like a puppy starved of love. The emotions and fights they had were reminiscent of real world couples, body or no body.It made me rethink how relationships work these days. As bad a rap as our generation gets for being constantly on our phones and laptops, sometimes it's the only way to stay connected to people that really matter. It's a significant form of communication but could never replace the comfort we find in being physically present for someone else.8 out 10 stars for a superb performance and a unique storyline.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

But on the small screen it works really well. The actors' performances are excellent and the script is very good as well. There are plenty of ironic laughs (the consommation scene is a real hoot) but underneath them is a sad theme - this is all about people's inability to connect with each other in the digital age, and how we can grow closer to our machines than to other humans. The main character, a recently divorced, sensitive fellow, begins to fall in love with the artificial intelligence (called an ""OS"" in the movie) that runs his phone.

Certainly, I am not fond of or good at socializing among crowd. So I could feel this movie spoke for my feelings. The lead character was a caring and sensitive person. However, he was also introvert and often unobtrusive. He only needed one caring person to share his life with. That's why he would fall for his OS.

What is real and what is not,"Science fiction, throughout the ages continue to harness my attention may it be written in films or in books. Every composition and in every word play consisting of this theme, I marvel at the idea of having fiction and science: which we all know carry facts, combine together to create a media worth one's recognition. In relation to this, the film's case handled the ups and downs of what we all utilize, the 'computer'.As a member of a generation, transfixed to technology and living codependent with the ease it contributes to our everyday lives, I find myself thinking what life would be if the advancements happening today cease to exist in the time before us. Let's say perhaps, social media such as instagram or twitter do not exist; A society where tinder and bumble wouldn't even be created, online relationships wouldn't be a thing.Putting myself into a lens to view the film made me reflect deeper on how perceptions of other people vary with the emotional capability of that specific person who experiences the situation independently. Online dating profiles in our current social climate, provokes the false impression of falling in love with a photo and not the real person behind it, makes it not so hard to believe that someone could fall in love with a character run by artificial intelligence, pertaining to what happened to the main character in this movie. Though we must not demean a person's capacity for affection, this deceptive reality on the other hand must also be mentioned to allow the gravity and awareness of one's well being to real life. ""Boundaries must always be maintained lest things go awry and our reality becomes compromised.""In summary, ""Her"" is a very captivating and moving film. This is a movie I'd recommend to a lot of people as it made me contemplate on such matters and made me use my brain. I love movies that urge me to talk about it afterwards and further drive me to write long reviews like this.

Comfort movie,"As the credits began to roll after watching Spike Jonze's ""Her,"" I found myself in a contemplative silence, deeply moved by the sheer beauty and emotional depth of this cinematic masterpiece. Released in 2013, ""Her"" isn't just a film; it's an experience that gracefully explores the complexities of love in an increasingly digital world.Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of Theodore Twombly is nothing short of extraordinary. His performance is a delicate dance of vulnerability and authenticity, allowing the audience to intimately connect with the complexities of Theodore's solitude and yearning for connection.
