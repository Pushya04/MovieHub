The 90s was the era of great thought provoking scifi,"I had the luck of watching contact at the cinema when it came out . Being young meant that watching a movie of this grandure in a grand movie theatre with massive screen (something that was dying out at the time) means that this movie has been engraved in my mind .
But it is not due to nostalgia or corrupt memory .
Contact is a thought provoking mind bending movie ahead of its time .
In fact it is the Interstellar of the 90s .Stunning gorgeous visuals , and a storyline and plot asking some hard questions and providing answers that many might not want to accept as the movie battles between science fitction , science fact and religion in a way that in the end no one is left wanting .This is not just a movie , this is an event !",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"No film has moved me more than this one, ever","This, for me, is a masterpiece. I have enjoyed it more with each viewing.Carl Sagan was a great man. He promoted science in the way it should be, portraying the profound mysteriousness of our universe with humility, and without dogma. In his book, the Demon-Haunted World, he quoted Einstein:""All our science, measured against reality, is primitive and childlike -- and yet it is the most precious thing we have"".Contact conveys this simple message in a subtle yet immensely powerful way. The performances are some of the most compelling I have seen, particularly by Jodie Foster and David Morse.Just magnificent.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An Awful Waste Of Space,"Although Jodie Foster has won two Oscars in her career I think her best work was done in Contact, a film where the only recognition it received was a nomination for Best Sound. She also never did a more serious film about a more serious topic. Are we in fact the only life there is in this vast universe and how do we find out.As a scientist, something she wanted to be all her life, Foster is determined to get answers in the best way she knows, build the biggest radio telescope there is and throw out a few signals. Someone out in the great beyond will answer. Foster gets an answer.What I love about Contact is that the gamut of human reactions to the possibility of life is dealt with in this film. It ranges from the multi-billionaire who wants his own life extended John Hurt, the geopolitician who is interested in power James Woods, the sincerely religious men of faith who want to see how God fits into the scheme of things Matthew McConaughey, and even the religious terrorist who fears that a mountain of man made dogma that he's based his life on will be washed away Jake Busey. Busey's part is extremely relevant, we have way too many of those in the world and strategically placed they can cause catastrophe.Foster gets a blueprint for a space time travel machine, warp drive the likes of which James T. Kirk only wished he had. It goes horribly wrong the first time, Foster takes it herself for a second try.Mention should also go to David Morse who plays Foster's father, first in scenes with young Jena Malone who was a science prodigy as a kid and later Foster during her 'journey' gets to talk to Morse again. Was it real or a hallucination. His scenes are the highlight of the film for me.Contact takes no sides in the end, it simply takes the position that in terms of the universe humankind is taking baby steps. If we are really the only life in the universe it seems like an awful waste of space.The special effects are fine, the sound was considered Academy worthy. So much more of Contact is, most especially the performances of Jodie Foster and her supporting cast.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Ms. Foster's finest work, and the most thoughtful, scientifically accurate film since Kubrick's 2001","In my 61 years, I have seen many science fiction films. Few have exceeded my expectations as this film did. I remember seeing it in a theater (something I rarely trouble myself with these days), and finding myself at times gripping the armrests in excitement. This film builds like great stories should. However, even the best stories can collapse under the weight of a bad script, poor acting, or shoddy editing. I'm happy to say that none of these issues plagued this film. Ms. Foster delivers an extremely powerful performance and is a wonderful role model for women in science. All of the other actors also deliver memorable performances, but make no mistake, it is Ms. Foster's polished performance you will be thinking about when this film ends.Much has been made of the last 1/4 of this film, with many viewers feeling a let down. I get that. The amazing build up and tension in the third quarter of the film is quite unexpected, but if you approach the final quarter thoughtfully, you'll see that it makes perfect scientific sense. That's rare in any science fiction film pitched to mass audiences. As such, this film makes an amazing contribution to the entire genera.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""For Carl""","Reading other peoples' reviews, I see a split 50/50 argument where one side loves the movie and the other hates it. I am not one bit surprised, due to the importance of the film, and I feel this is proof that Contact is one of the most powerful movies of the decade. Like the reaction from the civilians to the machine, a movie with this much heavy firepower is likely to get both loathing and praise from its viewers. I for one praise the film, for its toughness and sensitivity, symbolism and passion, and the fact that it is a rare science fiction film, a gem which was released in a time where scientific intelligence in film has become a nothing short of a joke as the wonder of the universe has been ignored and the mystery of alien life have become a neverending trail of movie villains.The film of course centers around the science vs. religion theme, the oldest and most frightening of all school debates. Instead of taking the more independent path the book takes, the film takes the more sensitive on the science vs. religion argument throughout the film by telling us that science and religion points to the same direction (the ""pursuit of truth"") but are misunderstood when studying the nature of their WAY of finding the truth (science uses evidence and answers, religion uses love faith). At the end of it all, the film lets us know that if science and religion stops colliding with each other and starts to combine and compliment each other (listen to Ellie's final words in her testament) the human race might achieve things we can only dream about now.A perfectly refreshing film, with lots to say, great acting and directing, sound and special effects. Robbed by the Academy.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Absolutely brilliant; unequivocally, completely amazing in every way.","N.B: This is a very long monologue because I adore CONTACT to bits.I loved the irony present in Contact, as well as its religious imagery and its attention to fine detail.  To see the universe in that opening scene was breath-taking, and the reason for it all coming out of Ellie's eye becomes blissfully apparent in light of the end, for her journey was just as much a physical as well as an emotional and spiritual one.  The photography was superb, alternating  between expansive sweeps of the landscape and the universe, and close, intimate shots of the characters, symbolising the potential for the unknown' as well as an equally important knowledge of all that is familiar  contact with our own people.The irony manifested itself in how Ellie, who denounced Palmer's ability to possess complete faith in God, ended up being the advocate of such a faith, though of a different strand; she could now appreciate Palmer's passion. Remember that Biblical verse that when paraphrased reads something like: `The man who is not willing to give up his life will lose it, but he who is willing will gain it'?  This religious imagery correlates to how Drumlin lost his life in pursuit of personal acclaim, while Ellie, who admitted that she would freely give up her life in pursuit of life's tormenting questions, gained it in such a memorable and satisfying way.  She found inner peace, having made contact with two intelligent races; one of the skies, and one of her own kind.  The dried up cliché alluding to aliens: `We are not alone' begins to take on a new meaning in a multitude of dimensions in light of this brilliant movie.I read this wonderful blurb' about Contact, and I think this following line delineates the film, and why watching Contact became such a defining film for me: `[Ellie's] personal voyage will take her beyond theory, beyond knowledge , beyond experience, to the realization that true vision is ultimately the union of fact and faith.'  This duality of life and true fulfilment which arises from the reconcilement of contrary beliefs is surely a theme of the film: evinced through the conflict created by science vs. religion, fact vs. faith, vision vs. reality.Carl Sagan's novel was also a fulfilling pleasure to read.  I thought that the message in pi was an absolutely crucial element of the book, the implications of such a message being that there is an all-powerful force' behind the universe, which brings order to disorder, and such a force' we might call God.  So possibly, C.S's novel did prove the existence of God. Maybe the recurring C' pattern in the film, (the quadruple' system Ellie saw near Vega, the sands in her father's hands and that which she holds in the end), is indicative of such order  that no matter how large or small an event, i.e, whether a message is written in the sky or in the palm of one's hands, order is present, and implies a powerful force guiding the universe.I am incapable of seeing many, if any, faults with this film  I truly cannot understand why anyone would think it contrived or the same as something as brain-numbing and gung-ho as `Armageddon'. It is truly an intellectual film with meanings at many levels  and so thought-provoking!  Perhaps Matthew McConaughey's representation of Palmer Joss was a little unbelievable, and the thrice-repeated `It's an awful waste of space' phrase that connected Ellie to her father and Ellie to Palmer can be seen as a tad too sentimental on the one hand, but on the other, it serves to punctuate the potentiality of the physical universe, and the human mind, which, in C.S's case, conceived this book.  Jodie Foster is magnificent, but then again, isn't she always? The extraordinary passion Ellie exhibited was admirable  her innate sense of wonder balanced by a stabbing loneliness, born out of the premature departure of a dear parent.I love Contact because of its poignant humanity, the sense of wonder that resonates so strongly throughout the film and indicates the strength of that wonder which inspired C.S in the first place, and because it searches for meaning so idealistically, while still, necessarily, maintaining the sometimes harsh realities of life (personified by James Woods' unsympathetic and skeptical Kitz).To those who hated the ending, you obviously missed a crucial component of the film, that of possibility and potentiality.  To have Ellie return with tangible evidence of alien existence would demolish all the credibility that Robert Zemeckis attempted to create by showing the current American president referring generically to the event of the message being discovered, the decision to build the machine, etc.  The ending was crafted in such a way as to enable a choice by the viewer/reader to be made  just like how C.S equally respected those in his book who chose to pursue a path of science or religion.  We, the audience, are allowed to decide what really happened, and this makes Contact an almost interactive and therefore a more intimate experience.Contact has something to say to everyone, and has real meaning that cannot help but whisk viewers and readers alike to some thrilling place.  To those who thought the film predictable, and had not previously read the book, I would say that you must be VERY creative if you managed to anticipate all that Contact had to offer.  But for everyone who was as much inspired by this magnificent film as I was, here's the most important lesson to be derived from both the book and the film: `For small creatures such as we the vastness is bearable only through love.'  This enlightened message, dreamt up by Carl Sagan, makes me even more convinced that a book critic who said of Carl Sagan: `with terrestrials like him, who needs extras?' is exactly right.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Excellent concept but does not fulfil potential,A dedicated astronomer (Jodie Foster) discovers a message sent from a distant planet and manages to decode it's surprising contents.Excellent sci-fi concept with a strong performance from Foster.I mostly enjoyed the film.

The film promised so much but ultimately did not fulfil it's potential.,7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Diamond in the Rough,"So many movies out there are pure drivel. They use sex, or shock, or sex to sell two hours of something that in no way contributes to our existence; be it inspiration, knowledge or spiritual awakening.Contact is an exceptional example of a movie that DESERVES to exist. From the spectactular beginning shot that shows us just how small we are in a world that once thought the universe was made for, and around, mankind; to its realistic conclusion that any X-Phile would expect to happen: this movie appeals to our humanity, intelligence and sense of adventure.One of the greatest realisations that the movie will guide you to is that what we search for in outer space is actually in our own backyards. We are cut off from each other and sci-fi tries to quell our loneliness with ideas that we'll meet E.T. and wont feel so lonely in our existence. But were AREN'T alone... we have each other.I never get tired of watching this movie, though I wish they brought out a packed special edition DVD full of behind the scene effects and the like.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Contact,"""Contact"" is an interesting film, which primarily isn't about whether we're alone in space or not. Mostly it seems to examine and contrast three distinct types of personalities: the idealist scientist (Eleanor Arroway), the religious believer (Palmer Joss) and the logical strategist/ manipulator (David Drumlin or Michael Kitz). The film bridges the first two types (in the end Arroway's motivation is driven purely by faith, while Joss' faith reaches beyond religion), while the third type is the one that's really in control of mankind's destiny (the manipulative Drumlin gets the mission initially, while the cold logic of Kitz and co demands they cover up what really happened).Philosophically-wise, the film goes for a kind of expanding and ""exterior"" way of thinking. When Arroway meets the aliens (mind, in the guise of her dead father) they reveal that there are many civilizations in the universe etc but that mankind (in their own words capable of beautiful dreams and horrible nightmares, and always feeling void and alone) must find it's own way and in ""slow moves"". Also, they reveal that ""the only thing that makes the emptiness bearable, is each other"".The film is rather tame and fairly predictable in it's stand. When Arroway meets the aliens, she could be talking to God. Returning to Earth without any solid proof, she doesn't convince about what was essentially a religious experience. The film exhibits this bridging of science and religion with ridiculous amounts of melodrama, in the usual slow-motion emotional-exploitation sequences and mellifluous strings. Standing as some sort of middle-ground between ""2001, A Space Odyssey"" (man reaching for the outwards) and ""Solaris"" (man delving in the inwards), the problem is that director Robert Zemeckis is neither a Stanley Kubrick nor an Andrey Tarkovsky.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I dont have any problem with America, but there are a lot of things you have to consider besides that nation.

Really?,"So, 26 minutes in she's already slept with a Jim Morrison looking vicar, had her facile back-story explained with sledgehammer flashbacks involving herself as a Cute Kid(TM), and now the cartoon villain has taken away her funding and is probably about to tie her to a railway track... It began to seem unlikely that I would finish this cloying, formulaic, cinematic fart, but perseverance did pay off.There are some interesting ideas at work, and an unusually strong emphasis on science, albeit blurred at times by a clumsy attempt to lever religion into the argument.If you can overlook the many clichés, 1-dimensional characters and the some of the miserably cringe-inducing moments in the script, it's actually quite enjoyable. But it will never be a classic of any genre, least of all Science Fiction.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Falling Short in the Imagination Department,"Contact is loaded with scenes of a heroine, an astronomer played by Jodi Foster, fighting against great odds for the ""truth"" that some alien civilization is just itching to communicate with us. Foster's character is so perfect, she is revered like a priestess. There is little else in Contact that is explored in depth much beyond this holy quest of the Foster character.Besides being too perfect, I say the Foster character is holy because the rest of the world in this film is filled with spiteful, small minded and just weird people. Rival scientists lack vision. Government officials are penny pinching liars who go from disbelief to let's nuke the aliens. Religious leaders want to suppress the truth. And the general public? The public at large are portrayed as a mass of howling primates who blindly flock from one big event to another. In this mass of humanity religious followers from New Age to traditional get to be trashed in broad strokes as mindless fools singing and dancing in some trance. Finally, Contact claims there are super rich folks living in airplanes flying around the world or in outer space just waiting to meet alien species.With all of these extreme stereotyped characters and the circus atmosphere, I am reminded of a satire such as Mars Attacks or a tongue in cheek sci-fi disaster yarn like Independence Day. But Contact wants to be taken seriously. This is Carl Sagan's story after all.Well, the film briefly tries to create a meaningful relationship for Foster with the character played by Matthew MacConaughey. But soon MacConaughey's role also becomes paper thin as he becomes the comforter to the persecuted Jodi who is like Joan of Arc on trial.All of this would be forgivable if there was a serious consideration of what our involvement with an alien species would mean. Excellent films that deal with this topic include 2001 and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Here is where Contact falls flat. In an overly explained series of scenes mirroring 2001 Foster sort of meets an alien then quickly returns to earth. Foster's experience is like a dream. Who are the aliens and what would contact with them mean to us? The movie doesn't go there. There is a vacuum of ideas here as empty as space. The story simply goes back to Foster being the persecuted noble scientist.Out of all of this, the final message of Contact is that fundamental scientific research, that has little immediate practical value, requires faith. It is like a religious philosophy in a way with one difference being that we are supposed to fund it with tax dollars. Considering all of this, there is very little I can say in praise of the movie besides that Foster's acting is good as always and that technically the film is well made.The whole movie felt like a fund drive on public television, ""give money to the poor scientists"". If Contact is one big ad for astronomy research at least make alien contact more interesting. And finally, to create a noble character you do not have to belittle the rest of the world.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Excellent Book - Poor Film,"When I first heard that Contact - by Carl Sagan was made into a film I was very excited. The book is good in its own way - a little artificial but that is to be expected when a scientist turns to fiction.One recurring theme in the book is the search for the truth and the search for the numinous experience (the religious). This theme is very much present in the movie. In the book Ellie is an agnostic, a sceptic both as a scientist and in her spiritual life. In the movie she is made a logical positivist. Well this is to be expected since you have to be explicit when making movies.But in the movie Ellie has to accept the fact that her only way of justifying what she knows to be the truth is by a leap of faith, thus making traditional religion the ""winner"" of the debate, the book explicitly says that Ellie finds concrete proof of her version of the truth, thus all but eliminating the element of faith.The movie thus ends with the opposite conclusion of the book.When the book was about the search for truth, the possibility of extra terrestrial life, and the inherent beauty of life. The movie pretty much boils it down to being an preaching on the gospel of organised religion.I didn't like it because I've read the book. But as a film it didn't work to well either. Rent this,  to see on a rainy day, but be warned its just a 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Foster Makes ""Contact""","All of the greatest work by the greatest scientists has been done while they were very young, when they were stupid enough to believe that two-plus-two-equals-five, and pursued it instead of listening to all of those who were much older and wiser who said Don't Waste Your Time. Einstein, it has been said, asked all of his important questions before the age of twenty-five, then spent the rest of his life working on them. `Contact,' directed by Robert Zemeckis, is the story of a young scientist, Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster), who like Einstein and all the greats before her, has been asking questions and seeking answers since she was very young. And now, as a member of the SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) team, she is able to pursue her obsession with the mysteries of the galaxies and the infinite universe that surrounds us.  Her job is to sweep the skies, using the most sophisticated equipment available, for a signal from deepest space.  It may be her job, but for Ellie it's a labor of love, for she is convinced that there is something, or someone, out there somewhere, because otherwise, she reasons, what a terrible waste of space it would be.  Ellie may be a dreamer, but she knows in her heart that it is the dreamers who over the years have been responsible for making us evolve, making us learn and grow because they are the ones who take insane, foolish ideas and pursue them.  And to her, two-plus-two will always be five.Ellie loves her job and believes in what she is doing, but it's been a struggle over the years, as she and others have had to constantly fight for the funding necessary to keep the project alive, begging for dollars from short-sighted, unimaginative people with vision that goes only as far as the bottom line of their budget book.  It's been a tough row to hoe, and she's had to swallow a lot of pride over the years, but then one day it all pays off, when in one magic moment she hears what she's been waiting for all her life:  A signal from a distant end of the galaxy-- someone attempting to communicate, to make contact, with the people of the Earth.Ellie and her team soon realize that, whomever it is, they are using the universal language of prime numbers in their attempts at making contact; and when Ellie deciphers the code, she discovers something monumental in the bargain.  But it's a message of global importance, something much bigger than she and her team alone, and she soon find herself fighting to remain a part of the drama that is only beginning to unfold-- the first interaction between human beings and an alien life form.  And it's only the beginning of the adventure and the wondrous places this film is about to take you.Jodie Foster gives a performance here that demonstrates what a gifted, talented actor she is.  Her Ellie is convincing and believable, and someone to whom you can genuinely relate, no matter who you are or where you're from, because there is something universal in Ellie's passion and longing to discover the truth and to see beyond the veil of our limited mortal capacities.  There's a strength to Ellie, born of a combination of intelligence and innocence, as well as tenacity and faith, and Foster manifests all of these complexities of her character beautifully, with a performance that should've landed her an Oscar nomination.  In this role, she is simply as good as it gets.As the young Ellie, Jenna Malone gives a terrific performance, also, which certainly captures the same spirit that we find in the adult Ellie.  And there's a maturity she brings to the character that far exceeds her years. She was a perfect choice for the part, and if this is any indication of what she is capable of, Malone has a successful career ahead of her.The supporting cast includes David Morse (Ted Arroway), Matthew McConaughey (Palmer), Geoffrey Blake (Fisher), William Fichtner (Kent), Tom Skerritt (David), James Woods (Kitz) and Angela Bassett (Rachel).  Zemeckis did a brilliant job of bringing this film to fruition, especially in the way he allowed Foster the time to really develop her character, by giving her that extra moment at just the right time that ultimately meant so much in the final analysis.  Too often it's those few minutes that wind up on the cutting room floor that make the difference between  a good film and an exceptional one; and between Zemeckis and Foster, they took it to the edge by taking some chances to realize that combined vision, which in the end made this a great film.  Thoroughly engrossing and entertaining, `Contact' will transport you to places you can only imagine, and it's all done with style and in a way that makes this a truly memorable cinematic journey. It's what the magic of the movies is all about.  I rate this one 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Films are rarely as good as the bookbut there are exceptions to the rule,"This remains true for this very good adaptation of the classic book by Carl Sagan. Sagans' idea was to make science and the elite commandeering of information available to the majority, he wrote his books for a wide audience and I think the film shows this as was intended by its author.The Film is roughly about Dr Arroway, Ellie, and how she handles being alone in a world without family or close friends. It is metaphorically able to make us all think about how isolated we as a race, and as people can feel.Ellie, a brilliant young scientist working on the mistrusted SETI program discovers a message sent to earth from distant star system Vega. On its discovery Ellie must battle with the Military, Pentagon, and Male Dominated scientific world to keep her cards on the table and her discovery that of her team. Ellie is constantly kept in the game by he benefactor, a rich technological industrialist mogul who has a vested interest in her participation of the programme to reach this alien culture.I don't wish to go on any further and spoil this movie as I rate it as a fantastic exploration of Science Vs Religion and the entire subsequent human spectrum in between. As a film there were several alterations from the book that I felt could have been included, for example not just one traveler but a range of them, philosophers, theologists, scientists, poets and Dr Arroway.I have watched this film a number of times and still find it a joy to watch the fifth, eighth and tenth time. Jody foster playing a not so dissimilar to her role in Silence of the lambs (attractive, clever, young, successful woman battling in a male world) is exceptional and delivers feeling and intellect alongside an impressive script.I would give this film an 8.5 and recommend it to anybody, but if you are a sci-fi fan and haven't seen this film then you're in for a treat.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"An Amazing and Deeply Nuanced film, That is Deeply Divisive, and Yet One of the Best Sci-fi Films of All Time.","I have watched ""Contact"" at least 10x's throughout my life, it came out when I was 12yrs and we saw it in the theater. I was blown away by it then, and I still am blown away by it now, and I love the build up to the last 40 minutes, it is exhilarating. The only thing I felt was a weak point in the film, was Matthew Mcconaughey. I did not feel it necessary to the story, and in some ways, bogged it down, and I felt that way even the first time I saw it, this is not to say he is not enjoyable, he is, and I still enjoy the parts with him, but I did find his character to not be totally necessary to the story. Despite that one minor flaw, it still remains to this day one of my all time favorite films.I don't think this is a perfect film, and I do not believe there is such a thing, but I do believe that overall, it is pretty darn close, this is a film that deeply explores the divide between science and religion, and I feel, shows both sides very well. This is a long film, clocking in at over 2.5hrs, but I have never been bored watching this film. Every time I watch this film, I feel the same, I always get this awe of sense and wonder about the cosmos, in fact, it is what made me want to study cosmology (which I still want to) and explore the galaxy.I also felt this was a movie about discovery and risk and not letting people stop you from doing what you are supposed to do. I love the discoveries and mysteries of this film, and I have felt the way this film reveals itself is astonishing. Mystery and Horror film makers could take a few cues from this film about twists and surprises. This is a film that provokes discussion, which is what every great sci-fi film or story should do, it doesn't have to be totally accurate or right, but it should always cause you to think and question, and this film absolutely does on many levels.I have noticed that the vast majority of the negative reviews on here are by people who hated the fact that this movie, at it's core, is about faith, not necessarily faith in God, but faith in general. People who seem to be atheist, I don't see these things as incompatible, you cannot prove Darwinian Evolution, and yet, many believe in it. We believe a great deal about the Universe, which often get's unproven months later or years later, that in itself takes faith. We cannot see a great deal many things, and yet see the effects of them, and thus believe in them. This is really what this film is about. I don't believe this film should rattle your feathers just because you do not believe a god exist, I enjoy movies that ""disprove"" God, and yet, I am a believer. It should not take away from a film's enjoyment per se, especially one as well made as this one.I never saw Ellie's lack of evidence as her admitting that religion needs to exist. That is silly. I also find it silly that some people think that the arguments over God or not God, invalidate this film, or that it shoves things down your throat. I loved the struggle, and the fact that she didn't back down from the people who were discriminating against her because she didn't believe what most people do, was very encouraging. As already stated, I am a believer, and yet, I never once got mad at her insistence that God didn't exist. Why? Because other people's opinions do not change my view point, and it blows my mind how some people can be rattled like this by a movie, that in my mind, seemed to play both sides of the fence pretty well. I don't believe the conclusion at all says one way or the other on the topic, other than there are things we cannot explain all the time.God Bless ~Amy",,Anonymous,Mystery
Big ideas,"Dr. Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster) starts work for the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) program at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. Her mother died in childbirth and her dad died when she was a child. Kent (William Fichtner) is a blind researcher. Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey) is a religious writer who becomes her romantic partner. David Drumlin (Tom Skerritt) is the bottom-line head at the observatory who shuts her down. Four years later, she is still the outcast as funding and facilities dry up. Then she finds an extraterrestrial signal. Drumlin and NSA adviser Michael Kitz (James Woods) take over. Hadden (John Hurt) is an eccentric tycoon who has been supporting her.It's a brainier science fiction. The first half is exciting in the non-action way. It is smart. It tries to add in some action but it is unable to transition. It may be better not to transition. Also Robert Zemeckis overdoes the space travel and the other world. The religious debate takes up too much space and gets a bit clunky. The logic of hiding such a massive construction is highly questionable. The first half rivals any of the best sci-fi and the second half isn't bad either.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"An excellent,  thoughtful movie","This movie examines the premise of what would actually happen if we were to make first contact with aliens, and how that contact would logically happen.The protagonist is loosely based on an actual astronomer named Jill Tartar. She is focused on finding other life almost to the exclusion of all else in her life. When aliens respond to the Earth's first interstellar broadcast, she is caught up in the hysteria.What follows is an interesting observation of humanity rather than any aliens. We learn very little about aliens throughout the movie. Rather, we see how people react to knowledge of this magnitude. The movie examines religious, scientific, military and international reactions to the idea of humanity not being alone. I thought they did a fantastic job of representing the scale of reaction, from the fanatic to the skeptic, within the confines of a 2 hour movie. The movie mixes a thoughtful, sentimental tone with a good pace for action and excellent characterization. There is a somewhat arbitrary love story thrown in, but it is tolerable based on how it helps the protagonist's long-delayed progress towards a deeper understanding of her own humanity.The movie ends in a poignant yet hopeful tone, understanding our human problems but accepting them. I think the message is that the alien contact is the catalyst that will help humanity mature and grow past our more dark halves.If you like the movie I'd recommend the book. It gives much more insight on the aliens, and expands the scope as there are a number of scientists that participate rather than just one from America, and goes more in depth into the science. It also attempts to show that religion and science can get along. My favorite part is at the very end of the book where Sagan shows how God hid a message in the very fabric of the cosmos, that we could only read when we were ready. Be prepared however, the book is quite a bit drier than the movie and those who don't enjoy reading Discover magazine may have to dig in to get through the slower, more scientific parts.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Plodding,"I just watched ""Contact"" again on TV; I hadn't seen it in many years but it is as I remembered. While it is a decent film, it is somewhat frustrating though. It never really goes anywhere and takes much too long to do it. The only bright spot is Matthew McConaughey, as he so often is. And some of the visuals get hard on the eyes, especially toward the end. So, in summary, not a terrible film, but not really a good one either. Thus I rate it a 6/10. While it does well at expressing our collective aloneness and transience in such a big universe, the film can't help but feel as hollow and soulless as the atheism which permeates it. Not a movie that I plan on watching again.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Different from the book doesn't mean bad.,"I am used to hearing from just about everyone who has read a book that was made into a movie that the book is always better.  I tend to agree with this opinion.  Contact, however, shows that in the arts the norm is not always the truth; opinion, no matter how often it is backed up with evidence, can never break through the barrier into be a hardened and absolute truth.I saw this movie first before I read the book.  That is partly because I didn't know that there was the book until after the movie.  So, a year or so after the viewing, I got the book.  Of course, the movie, in general terms, follows the book fairly well.  I have to say, the movie can easily stand on its own merits just as the book can also.The immediate impression of the film after the book is that there is a great emphasis on faith, proof, truth and opinion.  These themes are not much brought up in the book - at least not with the same impact nor in the same way as in the film.  Of course, the field of Astrophysics, of which Carl Sagan was a practitioner, lends itself very easily to ultimate questions such as God, faith, truth etc.  The vastness of space and complexity of reality, viewed through the scrutiny of the scientific eye, is mind-boggling.  As was repeated in the movie several times: ""if we're all that there is, ""its an awful waste of space.""  Personally, I think that the book relates these notions of vastness and complexity much better than the movie.  But, the audience of the book was certainly not necessarily the same audience as the movie.To be more fair, the vastness which was expressed in the book was demonstrated to an equal degree, but differed in quality, by the ""aloneness"" of Dr. Arroway as she scuttles across the universe.  In the book, Dr. Arroway is not alone but go with a team of scientists, all of whom make their appearance in the movie.  There is much more detail given in the book of the trip through the device than in the movie.  In fact, there are very deliberate omissions made which eliminate the technological bent of the book.  Yet, the focus of the movie does not allow the movie to be diminished by these omissions in the same way that the book would unavoidably be lacking without those details.One final aspect of the movie which is relevant with respect to the book is time.  Of course, in physics, time has its leading role so it must make at least a cameo in a movie which relies on physics.  Astrophysics is tied inextricably to relativity which is likewise tied to time.  The timelessness of the device design sent via radio signals and the instantaneous trip Dr. Arroway seemed to put relativity into perfect perspective.  The book takes a slightly different view by using distance and the experience of each traveler of moving fast distances with no other apparent sensations of motion.  It all adds up to different but equal expressions of the science which Carl Sagan had mastered.Both the book and the movie are simply fantastic, one not outshining the other as regards their scope and vision.  Watch the film, it is a beautiful one.  Read the book, it is equally beautiful.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
WOW!!!! There is Intelligence in Hollywood!,"My only regret about CONTACT is that I didn't see it in a theater.This movie works on so many levels. It is a fabulously balanced concoction of thrills, suspense, action, politics, acting & characterization, awe, and...(ahem)...INTELLIGENCE! (And not just the alien kind!)Some have compared this movie to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY...with, perhaps, some justification. There certainly are more than just passing similarities. However, whereas 2001 relied on hardware to (almost) the exclusion of all else and placed a greater emphasis on ""spectacle"", CONTACT strives for more substance on the human and sociological level. It touches one's emotions in a way that most movies never attempt to, much less succeed. In this, CONTACT could just as well be compared to Steven Spielberg's masterpiece, E.T. But whereas E.T. was meant to wake up the ""child"" in us, CONTACT succeeds in waking us to the next level!

Sci Fi twisted by religion,"I had a chance to re-watch Contact today. I saw it originally when it was in the theaters, and I must say - I have VERY BAD memories of the movie.Which is strange - because if you know me, you know that I just love Science Fiction. I have a weak spot a mile wide. I can ignore massive plot flaws and bad acting, for just a taste of what mankind might become in the future, or what he might see in the future.And I admit, when I started watching, I was again captivated. A movie about first contact, and about human travel among the galaxies, and the massive complex machine that would take them there. I will tell you - the machine itself is a marvel. It was an amazing effect. The science, at least early on in this movie, is fine. Not amazing, but better than Hollywood's average.But throughout the whole movie, the intertwining of religion and science are clumsily handled. Ridiculous soliloquies are given by the religious right, and equally clumsy rebuttals by the scientists. Which all led in the end, to Science being forced to admit to Faith, in front of the US Congress no less. It was a shameful end.

The whole ""religion and science can co-exist"" theme the movie had going is entirely unrealistic and only serves to confuse the general public into thinking that reality is this great unknown where no one can tell whether Science or Religion is right. Religion and Science can't co-exist, because they directly contradict each other.

Inside this mess is an excellent film struggling to get out,"My expectations for this film were very high. I'm a sci-fi fan and it recently made a top ten list of sci-fi films. In the end I found it a mixture of excellence and drivel. The excellence includes Jodie Foster, always good value and she doesn't disappoint here. The plot is first rate too. Not completely original, being loosely based on 'This Island Earth' but takes it in a new and interesting direction.So the film obviously started on the right track but then the makers went down to their local 'film-scripts-R-us' where they spent approximately £1.50 and the result was worth every penny. The first 30 minutes of the film is totally irrelevant. I found one very small event that had something to do with the main plot but you would miss even that if you blinked. The middle part of the film is a series of unconnected sub-plots that leave you wondering when the main feature is going to start. We also have the Hollywood Standard Romance (TM) bolted on the side which clutters an already cluttered film. The result of all this is a film that feels way too artificial and I didn't get any feeling of involvement.The mystery and action when it did eventually start was crammed into the last part of the film and left more questions than it answered. There seems to be a fairly significant plot hole as well. Not wishing to give anything away but consider the message that was sent and then the explanation of it later on. Doesn't add up.Yet somehow in all this chaos is a really original idea. I just wish the makers would have had a bit more courage to make more of it.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

One of the smartest science fiction movies ever!,"I just got done watching Contact (1997) for the first time ever and I am genuinely surprised that no one talks about this movie more because this was truly amazing.Positives for Contact (1997):
First off, I have to give credit to Robert Zemeckis for tackling the movie's themes in a smart and intelligent way to the audience. As someone who tends to love his science fiction movies when they are dumb fun, but I do appreciate whenever you have a filmmaker who makes a science fiction movie that gets me to feel deep emotions through the story and characters. The other thing that makes this movie work is the all-star cast where you have Jodie Foster, Jena Malone, Matthew McConaughey, David Morse, Tom Skerritt, James Woods, John Hurt, William Fichtner, Angela Bassett, Jake Busey and Rob Lowe in the movie and they are all awesome. I actually cared about these characters and what they were talking about in the movie. The special effects and sound design here are fantastic from start to finish. And finally, the movie also has that feel-good atmosphere that is almost always present in all of Robert Zemeckis' movies.Overall, Contact (1997) is yet another underrated and underappreciated movie from Robert Zemeckis. This is one of the smartest science fiction movies I've ever seen in my life and I don't say that often about a lot of movies in the science fiction genre.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Basically, the hate of ourselves alone. The beggining scene was also quite touching, showing all the radio signals. Plus, for the time the CGI was pretty good.Now the minuses: This movie was way too long, and boring at times. The ending I had to watch multiple times because it was so confusing.

In the guise of her father, learns nothing, sees nothing but an illusion then quickly back to an Inquisition type grilling by the modern day equivalent of the Church in the 1700's in front of a huge crowd by herself and being criticized and mocked by who else than bad boy. James Woods playing an a hope which he does well and instead of saying.

It coulda been brilliant -- but it's not,"This could have been a brilliant story -- but, of course, that's simply not possible in Hollywood. The Club Med encounter with the alien species was ridiculous. Either show us the greebies or, if not, then the film's creators should leave the audience with such a sense of otherness or ""alien-ness"" as to make us appreciate just how strange it would be to encounter an extraterrestrial intelligence (e.g. the singing slab in 2001). The scene in which the aliens are first heard is exciting -- and so it should be. The plot would have been far more interesting if it had delved more in the confirmation and translation of the data they sent than with the mindless hearings on Capitol Hill as to whether there is a God or not. Let's be real, here. Were we to hear from another civilization, the first things Congress would be called on to determine is can we protect outselves against them (if they are dangerous) and how much would it cost to communicate and/or meet them. Just can't see how God would figure into this conversation. Anyway, as for the acting. Well, I can't stand Jodie Foster; she's an artistic fraud. But, she is rather good at playing herself (i.e. an intelligent person). She had zero chemistry with lover boy there, but, of course, she always aims to place herself in the center of a film, even if that is at the expense of the rest of the cast and the film's artistic integrity. And all the rest of the actors -- well, your basic two dimensions. This isn't all Zemeckis' fault. He had to work off Sagan's so-so book. Too bad. I'm still waiting for a good alien encounter film.

Religion. Science. Politics,"Robert Zemeckis' ""Contact"" can be a very flawed movie if you want it to be. Yet it avoids accruing any critics from my side because of how daring it is. It finds itself at the universal crossroads between science, religion and politics. Other movies have been there as well but no other has put the question so bluntly: ""Do you believe in God?""--if yes, why and if not why not?It is ambitious, pretentious, it engages existential questions without worrying too much about how logically absurd it is. This is why most people would hate it, but it is exactly why I love it so much. It contains many panoramic frames, but unlike other movies is not trying to show just how small we are, but rather it wants to contain everything--from a field of radars, to a sci-fi machine and space itself.Movies like ""Contact"" rarely succeed, but when they do their due is usually great. Zemeckis knew that Carl Sagan's novel takes place in almost a parallel universe so he has no issues with adapting logic to its own benefit. If the message is insightful and powerful enough, the result is a masterpiece, if not, is a laughable dud. Luckily, ""Contact"" insists on many taboo themes and does them well enough to come out on top.Each character is well-defined and have very flushed out principles. From Doctor Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster) the secular scientist who makes finding life on other planets an obsession more than a job to religious author Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey) carrying the flag of belief and able to appear almost everywhere for some reason and to opportunist David Drumlin (Tom Skerritt) who is a good guy, but doesn't flinch when the moment arises. In a way, he wants the same thing that Ellie does, yet he lacks Ellie's emotional wisdom. Her love for the stars is perhaps a result of her mother's early death; deep down is her she is really searching for.In the end, ""Contact"" doesn't answer any questions about life on another planets, but that is because Sagan's reliance on science and its lack of facts regarding spacefaring--any answers who could've been given are hypothetical at best. Instead, ""Contact"" focuses on emotional reactions, reactionary beliefs and both rational and spiritual experiences. The love Sagan shows to both secularism and faith is what made this movie earn my respect.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"""Encyclopedia Galactica""","Renegade scientist (a surprisingly willowy Jodie Foster) has harbored an obsession with frequencies and contacting parts-unknown since she was nine. She and her research team in New Mexico nearly have their funding pulled when, after four years, they still haven't any proof that life lies outside our solar system; but, at that moment, the combative doctor receives first an audio then a visual signal from a distant planet--and tangles in Washington bureaucracy for the first time. Robert Zemeckis ably directs this film-version of Carl Sagan's book, which features the usual quotient of naysayers and political ego-mongers (not to mention Matthew McConaughey as a fallen seminarian-turned-theologian and bestselling author!). The film begins so beautifully, with a magical God's eye view of the galaxy, that hope for the picture runs high for the first hour. After that, the narrative becomes entangled in its own red tape, and one has to wade through a lot of scientific data, political bullying, and faux news-clips from CNN before the emotional final chapter. Zemeckis makes an early mistake of mixing movie fiction with real-life players, and his film is uncomfortably stamped with something of a 'cheese factor' after pointless and dated visits from Larry King (who was in on it) and President Bill Clinton (who wasn't). It all leads up to a mind-bending exploration into space for Foster, yet what she finds in the untapped fabric of the universe may strike some as facile. Certainly the film's slick, savvy production and marvelous visual effects cannot be faulted, and Foster does her usual passionate work. *** from ****",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Hands-down, the best sci-fi film of the 1990s","To accurately and honestly review science-fiction, you must recall what science-fiction IS: namely, a story that develops from what is scientifically possible, not IMpossible. (The latter would be science-fantasy.) ""Contact,"" derived from the novel of the same name by Carl Sagan, conjectures one possible scenario of how a first-contact with extraterrestrials might develop. Sagan's original story is entirely based upon hard science and is devoid of the sorts of fantastic elements that characterize 98% of the ""science-fiction"" genre these days. Given this, Zemeckis' delivery of a story that is true to Sagan's original AND that represents a plausible, scientifically based story is extraordinary. Most directors cannot handle genuine science fiction, either because they must reconcile the story to the science, and/or because they refuse to yoke their creative muse in any way to the real world--it's much easier to make everything up. In addition to delivering a bona fide, sic-fi landmark film, ""Contact"" also thematically engages the viewer--an experience that is missing from almost every science- fiction/fantasy film produced these days. To my way of thinking, there are only five sci-films films that have ever fully engaged audiences in a thematic sense: ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" (1951 version) ""Forbidden Planet,"" ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" ""Solaris"" (1972 version) and ""Contact."" A sci-fi film of this caliber comes along about every ten years or so...if we're lucky. Meanwhile, it's sad that so many critics derided this film, largely because they compared it to films within the fantasy genre. Most likely, ""Contact"" will ride out the bad reviews and be vindicated in the long haul as a very superior work.Zemeckis' one and only flaw in the making of this film was his digital integration of President Bill Clinton archival footage (""the president"") with the actors; Zemeckis should be dragged through the streets by wild horses for this infraction. What was he thinking...?! It dates what is otherwise a timeless storyline. This aside, the film is chock-full of wonderment and leaves the viewer with a sense of having shared in something profound and deep. Acting is superb throughout, full of pathos and energy. Even Jodie Foster, who--true to her history- -overacts again in this film, gets off scot-free because it accords with the passionate, driven character of the geeky protagonist, Elleanor Arroway. The digital effects (besides the flawed, ""Forrest Gump""-inspired digital insertions of Bill Clinton) are truly memorable, and ""Contact""'s score by Alan Silvestri is easily one of the best 2-3 film scores of his career.The combined virtues of remaining mostly true to Carl Sagan's novel, cinematic engagement of profound, timeless themes (humanity's relationship to the cosmos, religious versus scientific testament, the nature of belief) and masterful detailing easily make this the finest science-fiction film of the 1990s. No other science-fiction film of that decade even comes close. Meanwhile, science-fantasy fans should look elsewhere.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

This is not a simplistic movie, the visuals are faultless and the clash of politics, religion and science very well done. As is the romance between the Reverend Palmer Joss (Played by Matthew McConaughy)and the atheistic Dr. Ellie Aroway (played by Jodie Foster). This issue of their sincerely held (but opposite) belief systems is never resolved but is left open. Ellie is a true scientist and even though some of the glory is withheld from her by a scheming ex-boss, somehow it all holds true, this sort of political jockeying happens and people do get away with it. The supporting cast is faultless and the special effects are incredible. Now the DVD - ""Special Edition"".

"A film that gets more right than it gets wrong, in a friendly tribute to Carl Sagan.","The theme of extraterrestrial life will always be a big deal for cinema, and is one of the most solid subjects within sci-fi. On the one hand, it has already given us a series of gems, but it also occasionally gives us films so bad that they are not worth the price of the plastic DVD. This film, for me, stays on positive ground: it gives us a solid story, intelligent enough to be believable, but it completely loses its way when it tries to introduce some action and shake things up a bit.One of the most positive aspects of this film is the credible and understandable way in which it talks about complex scientific subjects and concepts. There are high doses of science and if we take into account that Carl Sagan was one of the consultants who worked here (he died in the middle of filming and the film is dedicated to his memory), we can easily understand why it seems so solid. This is what happens when you listen to competent people, who know and who truly study.On a technical level, the film is reasonably within the standards of a sci-fi film from the late 90s with an already generous budget. However, despite some innovations such as the green screen and CGI effects, which were beginning to be implemented in the industry, not everything is really effective. Despite some high quality effects, the cinematography doesn't keep up, being excessively bland and uninteresting. I liked the focus on radio telescopes (we are more used to seeing optical telescopes, but listening to space is equally important) and it is incredible to see Arecibo again, one of the most cinematic and which very recently ceased to exist (which I greatly regret, by the way).Jodie Foster is a highly competent actress who deserves to be congratulated for all her effort. She is charismatic and strong enough to guarantee the leading role and the quality of her work only decreases towards the end, when she had to interact with the green screen, something that was not usual for actors at this time. We can still see the quite satisfactory work of actors such as John Hurt, David Morse, Tom Skerritt or James Woods. None of them have material capable of giving them substantial time or impact, but they all did the most they could with what they were given. Despite the relevance given, probably justified by the wage received, it was sad to see Matthew McConaughey in such a dull work, devoid of any substantial value. It seems that he was just making his money and wasn't interested in the project.The script has clearly positive points and others that, honestly, should have been eliminated. On the one hand, the scientific discussion and the theme of sending data through signals that can be captured by sound is highly relevant and looks good. I also liked seeing the difficulties that the main character experiences in obtaining financial and practical support for her research and overcoming the prejudices and lack of interest of her patrons. This is a picture of how much scientific research is currently going. From a certain point onwards, the film seeks to involve the Government and NASA, and things move towards a kind of bloated and histrionic action that is at odds with what had been done before. That was a mistake, but director Robert Zemeckis doesn't seem to learn from his mistakes, since it's not the first time it's happened in his films. Another error was the religious debate over alien life. This film did not call for this, the topic is left and should have been cut outright.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

That starts a chain that leads up to the creation of a spaceship sent by the signal and so on, and so forth.  A lesson in faith, si-fi, and how we feel going into 18 hours of darkness (so to speak).

"A noble effort, but the end result is a far from great film","While it's not terrible, I would also call Contact frustrating. There's something great buried within the bloat of this technically proficient and overlong film. Jodie Foster kills it in the lead role, and sometimes feels like she's too good for the movie. Elsewhere, Matthew McConaughey and even John Hurt give unusually off performances - they've both been much better.With 2010s sci-fi movies like Interstellar and Arrival, the sorts of ideas and plot beats that are kind of present in Contact have been explored better. Those films succeed in feeling genuinely emotional as well as thought-provoking. Neither's perfect, and Interstellar also falls prey to feeing a bit overlong, but this does feel like the sort of situation where one film walked so another two could run a couple of decades later.The structure of this film's what really lets it down, though, and it makes the long runtime feel much longer. There's some stop and start nonsense to the story at a handful of points, with things happening jarringly quickly and other things feeling repetitive in a way that didn't feel like it served a purpose thematically, or was otherwise deliberate.Some scenes impress, and when it strays close to what it could've been, Contact can be good. But it dumbs some things down while repeating other things and skipping over certain other (other) things that it should've spent more time on. Foster and the crisp look of the film keep it from being just an interesting failure, ensuring some things here are decent; even good... but I also don't really see what a lot of people love about this one.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Unmatched to this day,"When I read negative reviews for this film, I am literally disgusted.  As a film buff, I know objectively that I should keep in mind that not everyone likes every movie.  But I can't help but think that the people who do not appreciate this film are probably either too jaded with life to understand it or too pompous to accept the way it touches all of our lives.This film makes no concrete statements about the existence of God or aliens. It does not try to make those types of statements because those statements are antithetical to the themes of the film.  This is not a movie that is supposed to make you believe in God (or as one review I read put it, ""to make you think God is a little green man).  It's supposed to make you think, but moreover its goal is to make you feel.  It applies to all of us because it is about us as a species.  It's not about us as Americans, or men or women; it's about the deep rooted desire we all have to make some kind of sense out of a universe that doesn't give easy answers.I couldn't care less about the effects (although they were amazing).  The only thing I know is that everytime I watch this film, the last shot of Ellie looking up at the stars makes me cry.  Not out of sadness-lots of movies can make you cry out of sadness.  I'm tired of watching deep, dark, depressing films.  Just because something is depressing that does not make it inherently artistic.  It doesn't take much to make a person sad.  It takes a special film to provoke someone to tears of optimism and hope. CONTACT gives me hope for the future of film, as well as hope for just the plain old future.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Jodie Foster's continually grating presence as the ""we must continue"" figure drove me up the wall and to be honest I wished she had stayed on the foreign planet. Matthew McConnaghey was tragically below par and why did he do it? Perhaps the worst part of the whole film is that sequence on the other side. If they had left it out, there might at least have been a did it happen / didn't it scenario, but with the film dictating your thoughts as to the outcome is transcended to absolute tripe.

Some interesting possibilities presented here,"This is a solid Hollywood blockbuster that is saved from insipidity by presenting some interesting possibilities and good-looking effects. It also helps that an actress as cool and captivating as Jodie Foster is in the lead role. This was based on a novel by popular scientist/public intellectual Carl Sagan, who was a professor at Cornell U., and it is interesting to note that much of the story is about people jockeying for credit and influence, rather than about scientific discovery. There is a lot of corny stuff that happens here: e.g. A completely unbelievable and chaste romance between Dr. Arraway and a religious scholar played by Matthew McConnaughey, and a picture-perfect little scientist childhood for Dr. Arraway. Tom Skerritt is good as the obnoxious Dr. Drumlin; he really excels in that kind of role. The actual alien experience is unexpected, and done very nicely.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The young woman struggles against political pressure to be the first person to visit with alien life.

If one looks at the issues of the universe--we are as likely to go inward as outward. Quantum physics teaches us that uncertainties are as likely as certainties. Otherwise, why build the machine? Does it merely offer us movement into the endless void, or does it bring us to new awakenings? I hope that what we are is destined for better things than a frozen sphere, floating in space for tens of billions of years.Like so many movies, this one forces us to take its premise on faith--there are so many issues unresolved--and the whole thing is so cynical. But it forces us to look at issues of self and the future--that makes it worth our time. And it doesn't necessarily have to do with conventional religion.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""Science without religion is lame. Religion without science is blind.""","The quote in my title comes from Albert Einstein, and I get the feeling that Sagan agrees.Carl Sagan's story ""Contact"" approaches the age-old cosmic debate of science vs. religion. That is the strength of this film, and it presents some very lucid points. Without ruining anything, I'll say that the film illustrates an interesting grey area where both overlap. Namely: the realm of doubt.It shows that both sides can fall prey to fanaticism, and both sides are often guilty of close-mindedness. While Sagan definitely chooses his own side and hammers it home at the end, the film still remains objective enough that you can see the validity of both teams. I really enjoyed that side of the film.But the weakness of this film is that it falls back to a standard crowd-pleaser with a superficial romance, a predictable government villain (I suspect Sagan was venting his own personal frustrations at political intervention), and a sentimental family story which detract from the cosmic experience this film promises.If you're familiar with the films ""E.T."" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" you probably know how different they are. Both are good films, but ""E.T."" is mostly entertainment while ""2001"" is a philosophical puzzle. Here in ""Contact"" it feels like they set out to give us ""2001"" but they ended up with ""E.T."" In the director's commentary, the filmmakers admit to making some rather non-scientific compromises in order to keep the audience dazzled.For example, there's sound in space. Ugh! Why do they always do that? Kubrick showed us in 1969 that he could respect physics (no sound in space) and still keep us on the edge of our seats with suspense; in fact the silence of space made it even more chilling. Audiences aren't as dumb as Hollywood thinks we are. Or are we?I'd say this film is above average in terms of science fiction but below average in terms of science. Its main flaw is that it falls in the empty space between the two. It probably isn't action-packed enough for straightforward entertainment, and it's not quite heady enough to be philosophy. But it makes you think, and that's the mark of a successful film.If you enjoy ""Contact"" and find yourself craving something deeper, I highly recommend ""2001"" (the grandfather of all thinking films), ""THX-1138"" (before Lucas turned sappy), ""Solaris"" (either version, I actually prefer the remake) and ""2010"" (the sequel to 2001, not nearly as good but a worthy effort).",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A future classic,"Starting with a book by Carl Sagan is a good start, what makes Contact great is no one screwed with it too much. Most movies age poorly, but Contact is a rare case that matures rather than decays. The 90s were kind of a weird time for movies and far too many relied on CG, overused like a crutch at the expense of any kind of story. At the time, I thought society was nearing the peak of what was possible through generated graphics. It's funny how things age, ironically it seems nothing ages worse than overdone effects (remember when Transformers looked amazing?). It's sad Carl Sagan wasn't able to cameo, but I think Contact was done with care and respect to it's source. Hopefully wherever he is, Mr. Sagan is aware of those he inspired to start searching through the ""wasted space"", and one day answer if we're really alone.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Plottish, but Really Uneven","I'm sure I will be dissed harshly by the fans of this drivel. So be it. I expected a lot better. A LOT better.In what is evidently meant (at least at times) to be a philosophical examination of a more or less anthropomorphic concept of God wrapped in a mildly intriguing entertainment, ""Contact"" is so mundane it's laughable. The script is pedantic; something rather like an imaginative British TV miniseries, but from the '70s or '80s rather than the '90s.Like so many science fiction films of the '70s and '80s, the actors' interpersonal interplay is both phony and telegraphic, though the plot offers a nifty shock here and there. But, even though it takes a poke at the Red State hyper-religiosity that elected Junior and his cronies, this is not Ready for Prime Time.It could have been sooooooo much better. Contact could have taken the kind of a look at ""God"" that many of the great philosophers of the last hundred years have taken. (Well. Why not if that's what you're going to do in a film?) We could have looked at the ""God"" Einstein, Fermi, von Neuman and others found in quantum physics. Or it could have at least made mention of Poincare, Lorenz and Gleick and their God of ""Good Orderly Direction"" in ""chaos theory."" Or even at just the Eastern world's notions of ""God"" as something beyond our infantile, Western insistence upon society-organizing parentalism.In whatever event, the pacing is plodding most of the way. Some of this could have been dealt with by means of tighter editing, but like Sagan's own ponderous television series, the script is simply too ""wonderous."" (Although that's probably just fine with Sagan fans.)There's just waaaaay too much fascination with technology, as well as that sort of schizoid, emotionally clueless and oddly disconnected take on human intimacy that informed films of this kind in the '50s and '60s. What is -presented- as dramatic is simply not, until the special effects guys get a hold of a scene. And even then it's more like Roland Emerich's work on ""Independence Day.""Spielberg this is not. Nor is it Kubrick. H**l, it's not even Fred Wilcox and ""Forbidden Planet."" There is no real message or drama here. There's no magic, either.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
What lies beyond the cosmos and human understanding,"After Forrest Gump, Robert Zemeckis surprises again with a story about believing in something that goes beyond human understanding. Contact is a film focused on the journey that Jodie Foster undertakes to discover life beyond the stars, giving rise to a story that provokes the debate between science and religion. The film raises this concept in a great way. What she leaves after the journey that Jodie Foster undertakes is the doubt about thinking about something that science cannot explain or that lacks evidence. The point is that science has always been used to answer many questions and that this seems to be the only thing that offers the definitive truth. What arises next is the conflict regarding the existence of something much larger that could be defined as God. Here Jodie Foster is clearly a woman very attached to scientific facts and embarks on a journey that will lead her to a kind of spiritual revelation. What the film proposes is that the universe and the cosmos is full of many mysteries that go beyond human understanding and that human science always tries to decipher these mysteries. The relationship with religion is that belief in the divine has always been something done to try to understand the inexplicable. Because in the past technology did not exist and civilization was not very advanced, religious beliefs were founded to give an explanation to the mysteries of the cosmos and thus be able to adapt the inexplicable to human understanding. There are still comical and existential mysteries that science has not been able to decipher and the only hypothesis left for these mysteries is that they are something related to religious beliefs. The message that the film ends up conveying is that when you witness something that cannot be explained or proven, the only thing left is to believe in it and have faith that there is something in the cosmos beyond what you can imagine. For some that something is God and angels, for others it is intelligent life beyond the stars. Something that depending on what one thinks or believes, can give meaning to existence. The truth is that religion is too superficial and science is too logical, but it is clear that both fight to decipher one of the greatest mysteries of the universe. Without a doubt with the great cast it has, the great script and the soundtrack by the talented Alan Silvestri, Contact is an inspiring film about the wonders and mysteries of the cosmic world and life. My final rating for this movie is a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Soooo close....,"This is a real 'wudda, shudda, coulda' film. It would have been much better if the casting was better. It should have been more compelling if the editing had been sharper. And, it could have been a really fine film if the story line stayed put for a minute or two.The casting problems are self evident. Tom Skerrett plays a scientist who's been given the opportunity of a lifetime and yet can't even bother to look interested. He's awful in this. Truly bad. How bad? James Woods who is in this film for no apparent reason and has few lines is more compelling when he smirks than Skerrett is when he's mumbling five lines of dialogue. Mathew McConaughey is audible in this film which is both unusual and welcomed.This film could have used some serious editing. Way too many useless shots or scenes that simply drag on too long.The Freudian story line of the heroine's father longing as well as the silly interplay with McConaughey's character only distract from the story line.There are plusses here.

by way of review my style is what I was doing when the film came out,"A short time before the film was made I think I was still researching quantum mechanics using my imagination because it is the only free laboratory visual projection of Feynman diagrams in my head that I create to model what I was studying which was quantum gravity and the ability of an accelerated stream of heavy ions confined in a toroid to a circular path and producing and induced mass dilation quantum gravitational field with the increase in pull strength towards the center of the toroid. Due to some letters I wrote to someone over in the UK in which I described this to possibly create a wormhole if you use two of them, at the time of this movie, I was trying to visualized what would happen with three such toroids, could we create a black hole with this, or a more stable wormhole opening. At least they got the time and gravity/mass relationship right as the time dimension is strangely opposed to mass or gravity force field particular warp and bend of the fabric. The eighteen hours of recorded static, recorded in an instant of time at the center of that huge thing in the movie, the dimensional relationship is exactly like that. I was trying to study quantum mechanics, maybe the script writers and Ms. Foster somehow got telempathically linked to my imaginations 3 dimensional mental CAD display parts in my mind or something. I succeeded then in linking with a Ms. Small in the UK in our experiment along those lines. I also speculated that because the notion that black holes are being created all the time, they might pull themselves towards the nearest largest center of mass, the center of our galaxy, which someone proved with adaptive optics. I then concept ed the possibility of using two of those toroids aligned to be able to create a very short finite in length wormhole around a space craft, synchronized with a nano ring molecule accelerated in movement or RPM to the same velocity as the ions in the larger ones in order to maintain the spatial reference framework of the very localized spatial reality of the space craft as it enters the one dimensional conduit of the wormhole it is generating. I discovered and believe this is the only possible faster than light travel system we could use without violating the laws of physics since it utilizes mass dilation in specific manners and ways. I also had to think of ways to power this equipment too. So I am ready to try building a true star ship but it will require careful research's, some in space in orbit or away from the earth. It was discovered that there is a massive black hole at the center of our galaxy and I know that the images that were recorded of a star whipping in a few seconds in orbit around a very heavy unseen thing happened more than sixty thousand years ago and that black hole could have been fed in that time and there could be a huge amount of very deadly radiation that might be coming to intersect our solar systems orbit around the galactic center. If it is, it would literally sterilize the planet and building space craft to take everyone away from the planet until it passes, or digging and starting to live in underground cities might work to protect people from it too, we could take along chromosomes for all other animal and plant life forms from our world, but not living ones except human beings. Think of a large ring world orbiting at geostationary orbit, say some 300 to 500 miles wide flat ribbon huge construction with fusion motors to spin it up for a one gravity inertial centripetal force onto the inner side of the ring, 100 mile tall transparent walls at the sides pointing inward to hold in air and you got a life boat for earth life. What you would make it out of I haven't a clue, except maybe herding asteroids here and smelting them to use as construction material, oh well. It would be nice to license my concepts and ideas for finishing development and manufacturing. That is a topic for another discussion however, all in all a very excellent film, the actors did their jobs, I hated Mr. Woods in the film. I think the NAZI reference was to the human condition of perhaps the dangers of nationalism with regards to the concepts for faster than light machinery I have concept ed and am working on hull designs right now, all just to keep my mind busy trying to figure out safer ways to get into orbit than using dangerous rockets.

A beautiful movie with a beautiful message,"Does this movie have issues? Of course it does. There are some erratic jumps, some overly melodramatic moments and some unnecessary narrative elements. But these issues can't harm the movie's essence, its core message. ""Contact"" is a deeply optimistic film, I'm fairly sure everyone who's interested in astrophysics / astronomy will get a certain feeling watching it. This feeling you got as a child, when you looked up into the stars. Asked questions. Started to search for answers, only to find out that with each answer, a million new questions arise.Jodie Foster is simply breathtaking in this. She's truly a gifted actress. A young Matthew McConaughey does McConaughey things and you just have to love him for that. The rest of the cast is mostly just there to move the plot from A to B, but the movie is cast well overall.""Contact"" doesn't need fancy effects, it doesn't need a barrage of loud noises to capture the audience. The use of sound effects is exceptional. From radio signals, to static, to nature, every sound has meaning. I love how little music there is, it's only used in the most important moments. And then it hits you like a truck.I always cry watching this. It's such a wonderful depiction of humanity. Science doesn't work without determination. Faith doesn't work without humility. We all are searching for the truth. And we need each other to find it. That's what this movie is about.And I love it.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Hula Hoops movie,"This is the movie with the hula hoops. If you've seen the movie you'll know what I mean. The movie has an interesting premise and Jodie Foster is as usual excellent as a scientist who wants to prove that she has made contact with extraterrestrials, but the story itself is almost laughable and even allowing for literary license, which in this movie runs wild, renders the movie ultimately mediocre. The movie wants the audience to accept certain premises that so defy the laws of physics that when Ms. Foster's character is challenged as to the credibility of her findings, well, frankly, she fails so completely to make a case that the movie became pointless. One other thing, the movie portrays the construction of a contraption for space travel that resembles two huge hula hoops. Hence, I nickname this movie the Hula Hoops movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Loooooong and Fizzled,"When my husband flipped ""Contact"" on last night, I asked, ""Have we seen this before?""He said that we had, but at first it didn't ring any bells for me.

That doesn't mean that every loose end needs to be tied up, but that the viewer/reader is left with a sense that their journey has come to an acceptable conclusion. Contact started relatively well, flowed sluggishly from there on, and finished with a fizzle.I wasn't particularly looking for aliens or a revelation of god  just an interesting, compelling story.

One of the greatest sci-fi film in an alternate universe without 'Interstellar',"'Contact' has a beautifully-crafted storyline and a mind-twisting script thanks to the material created by Carl Sagan. I loved how science, language, and mathematics effectively depicted in the film to give audience a better understanding of how 'intelligent life', discovery, and universe are very important to the development of the story. I also liked how the film attached the 'science vs. religion' matter to further discuss the conflict of truth. Jodie Foster and Matthew McConnaughey delivered a good example of 'ideology separation' concept of relationship.
Visual effects are amazing but inconsistent. There are thrilling, engaging, emotional, and powerful scenes but at a specific point, you could get a 'Mars Attacks' vibe which is awkward and ridiculous. This film shares similar plot and impression with 'Interstellar' and could've been one of the best sci-fi films of all time if only the latter didn't made a better concept, technique, and presentation; or I'd say never existed.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Contact creatively communicates faith through science and mathematics.,"A universal language that transcends both time and space. One that enables any civilisation to communicate with another. Sure, colossal radars and technological innovations are required to personify these signals in an attempt to contact intelligent life, but the premise remains the same throughout. It's not evidence that drives us. The need for proof. It's not even the sense of achievement. It's faith. Whether we believe in a supreme being or not, faith is in all of us. When things go awry, we rely on the smallest ounce of belief. Zemeckis' epitome of 90s science fiction uniquely explores this, albeit occasionally heavy handedly. A scientist finds strong evidence of extraterrestrial life and makes a case for being the chosen human to make first contact. The duality between science and religion, including its cultural conflicts, is the spine of the narrative. Traversing the idea that if intelligent life did exist, does that diminish the existence of God? Several perspectives are portrayed, from the hysterical to the cynical. However, it's the protagonist's faith that is tested to which we see a great deal of development. She puts her faith in the aliens when a set of instructions are subliminally communicated to us, although conveniently solved. Foster was excellent in portraying this, acting as both passionate and fragile. Woods and Fichtner also deserve some credit, whilst McConaughey's performance was slightly lacklustre. Zemeckis' focus on visual effects, especially in the mesmerising third act, adds that layer of mysticism. Enhancing the enigmatic story even further. Yet, the selection questioning scene, which highlighted the protagonist's atheism, was too obvious in presenting its themes and felt unnecessary. Also, after the climactic ending, the fact that her recording device recorded static for 18 hours removes any ambiguity that the film wanted to present. An open conclusion is absolutely suitable for science fiction, and I wish Zemeckis was brave enough to retain that ambiguity. Still, a glorious philosophical journey.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Contact vs Interstellar.,"Deep space exploration, theology versus science, extraterrestrial contact, a central father-daughter relationship: there are a lots of similarities between Christopher Nolan's recent hit Interstellar and Robert Zemeckis' Contact; hell they even share the same star in Matthew McConaughey. There is, however, one massive difference between the two films: Contact is a genuinely great film, while Interstellar is merely entertaining in a 'did they really just do that?' kind of way (I often wonder if Nolan was having a laugh at the audience's expense).Obviously, Interstellar boasts state-of-the-art CGI, meaning that it trumps the rather dated looking Contact in terms of jaw-dropping visuals, but with an intelligent script based on the work of Carl Sagan, a terrific central performance from Jodie Foster, and a superb supporting cast that includes James Woods, Jake Busey, Tom Skerritt and John Hurt, Zemeckis' film is the clear winner. Thought provoking and life affirming, Contact leaves the viewer with a genuine sense of awe and wonder; Interstellar, on the other hand, leaves one impressed with the current state of special effects, but pondering more than a few awkward questions regarding the plot (that tidal wave gets me every time, and don't even get me started on the intergalactic bookshelf).8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
EVEN BETTER THAN THE BOOK!,"It rarely happens, but this film is even better than Carl Sagan's book by the same name. ""Contact"" (his novel) is fascinating, but the film adds a visual dimension to the story that helps to fully connect the main themes of science, politics and faith (subjects that don't particularly fit together very easily).The true strength of this film is its relevance. Science and religion continue to fight for dominance even though reasonable minds accept the need for both. It's like church and state - the functions may differ but the goals are similar. God wants us to be inquisitive about the unknown. If He didn't, we'd still be spending our nights in caves, vainly trying to figure out how to start a fire so we weren't freezing to death in the middle of Winter. This film supersedes all of this, and whether or not you believe in God or not is immaterial. It is a tribute to Sagan, and a testiment to all that is human, both good and bad.Jody Foster gives the finest performance of her storied career. There's not much more I can add to this that hadn't already been said.No spoilers here as usual but I will reveal that in real life Carl Sagan was a unrepentant atheist who frequently ridiculed religionists. He felt faith to be foolish. However, his widow, Ann Druyan, has described herself as an agnostic rather than an atheist, stating that ""science must withhold judgment on questions it cannot answer.""",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Boredom?,"Contact, what can I say... brilliant concept, award winning director, some of the best actors in the industry, crap film.

Painful, because the film is incredibly boring, and to see such fine talent like Jodie Foster involve herself in what I would say could have been a very promising subject, instead it was big budget turkey.  I think the main problem with Contact was the translation of the book into film.  Contact perhaps would have faired better as a tv mini series, or at least, they should have rehashed the script into something a little bit smaller.  As it is said, time slows down when your not having fun, the 3 hours in the cinema felt more like 18.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Mostly for sure not Robert Z's best movie but saved by the 3rd act.,"Many things about this movie do hold up anymore (mainly the special effects, which were better even in 2001 a Space Odyssey and that came out almost 30 years before this). It also wasted too much time in the middle when they went to Washington and it felt like the whole outer space alien discovery phenomenon was ignored and shoved to the side during scenes when they wasted time with a ball or dance or whatever that scene was. I can also see now that other movies that came out later copied a lot of the material and plot from this movie (namely Arrival and Interstellar which pretty much had the exact same things in it, but those were much better made films imo and did things much better).However...there were several things I liked about it. I feel like the genuine human/earth-wide reaction to this event would've gone a lot like how this film portrayed it (with people being both inviting and hostile toward the aliens and it becoming a big cultural explosion of unique reactions and celebrations/festivities but also gearing up for war). The film also did a good job going full circle in the end with the religion, philosophy, and science themes and discussions that took place throughout the film. Jodi foster acted very well too, it's one of her best performances for sure and I liked what they did with her and her dad in the movie as well.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Excellent - but sentimental,"Judging from some of the negative comments about Contact from other viewers, they are approaching the movie from the wrong perspective.  If you haven't yet seen this excellent movie, but are considering it, here is the one thing to keep in mind:Contact is not about an alien civilization.  It is about OUR civilization and how contact with aliens would affect it.The whole point of the movie is to highlight the things that make us human. It raises excellent questions about science, religion, and the search for meaning in life.If the movie has a fault, it errs on trying to skirt the issue of science and religion in an overly sentimental way - ultimately giving in to a sort of maudlin nod towards faith.  Sagan's book from which the movie was adapted had much more of an edge to it - and gave the nod to science.But this softness notwithstanding, the movie is still outstanding.  Just keep in mind that it is about US humans - our foibles and our strengths - and not about the aliens and you'll enjoy the movie much better.",,Anonymous,Mystery

A surprise on the DVD,"This is a clearly a high-prestige sort of sci-fi movie, what with Carl Sagan's name attached, and no doubt a large budget. Frankly, I was disappointed; I found it very talky, more pretentious than profound (as if, for a largely science-fiction-fan audience, there's anything daring or even controversial in the notion of funding scientific research and reaching out to possible extraterrestrial life!), freighted with a truly awful, unwatchable performance by Matthew McConaughey (with his accent, popping eyes, and bared teeth, he seems to be doing a bad impression of William F. Buckley, Jr.), and featuring only two action scenes, one of them genuinely gripping, the other so-so. // What interested me more than the film itself was listening to two of the three commentaries included on the DVD. The one by director Robert Zemeckis addressed itself almost entirely to the complicated and expensive special effects that seem a component of just about every scene; it's an initially interesting subject that eventually grows tedious and rather dry. Conversely, the voice-over commentary by Jodie Foster shows that this intelligent actress and filmmaker is even brainier, more thoughtful, and more articulate than I'd imagined.

Later Matthew McConaughey, one of the selectors, told Jodie that he deselected her because he did not want to lose her.This looks totally illogical and whimsical.2 – The ending is too is totally unconvincing!

"Very interesting and worthy but, my god, but it is full of itself!","Since childhood, Ellie Arroway has been interested in space and radio signals, spurred on by the death of her parents early in life.  As an adult she is a scientist who listens to space for signals from the stars, however her programme has it's funding cut and she finds herself looking for private funding.  Four years after securing such funding, she discovers a mathematical signal from space.  As the Government gets involved the signal reveals more information - thousands of pages of mechanical schematics. As the design is built, the world reacts to news of alien life.It is hard to complain about a film that tries to be an intelligent sci-fi at a time when the genre reaped greater box office rewards if you were shooting them like Independence Day.  It is a shame then, that the film doesn't totally work as a whole, even if it has moments that are thought provoking, exciting or interesting.  The plot is great in essence, however it bogs itself down with too much in the way or spiritual philosophising and emotional back story that, while being an OK idea, just complicates the issue unnecessarily.  The essential questions of who and why are lost in bigger debates that the script simply can't cope with - turning some discussions into weird pillow talk between Ellie and Joss!What it does do well is capture the fight between religion and science in this area - both come off equally well and it was well done that the film didn't slant too much in favour of either.  The politics and religious zealotry is given a bit of a pushing - but the good thing is; it never actually felt unlikely!  In fact, if anything, the project being a multinational project and scientis given a reasonably public free hand is more fiction that some elements here.  The film opens very well with a great pull back into space, where you really feel the vastness of space, and ends with a visually impressive scene that would have had much more impact if it had just lost the whole emotional back story connection (regardless of `to make you comfortable' reasons).  Between these two moments the film generally keeps things moving with the sense of discovery, but it does regularly get bogged down and it needs a terrorist to add some action - we could easily have condensed or lost a good 20 minutes of this film and things would have been better for it.The cast is quite deep but they don't all do well.  Foster is very good I felt, her character is developed reasonably well for a sci-fi and her performance is good.  McConaughey is less fortunate, his character is a bit of a mystery to me and the early scenes with him are pointless apart from setting him up for later.  Morse is lumbered with a horrid two-part role, neither of which is very good.  However the support cast is good and includes such actors as Woods, Fichtner, Skerritt (who is surprisingly welcoming of the aliens all things considered!), Lowe, Bassett, Busey, Hurt and Bill Clinton as himself!Overall this is a good film despite being weighed down a script too full of sentiment, back story and unclear philosophising.

The film isn't just about the destiny of one person; it delves into the destiny of us all.This cinematic piece beautifully illustrates how, despite the remarkable progress we have made, our journey as a species is still in its infancy. It suggests that the milestones we've achieved are just the beginning, and there's a vast expanse of potential and discovery that lies ahead. ""Contact"" addresses this concept by showing that the individual's quest, while significant, is part of a much larger picture - the evolution and advancement of human civilization.The film excels in its ability to articulate this perspective. It's not merely a story of personal achievement or scientific discovery; it's a metaphor for humanity's relentless pursuit of understanding and its place in the universe.

However, whether or not the information presented in this movie is factual or not is completely and utterly irrelevant.This movie allows us to tangibly feel an existence that is greater than this world. It allows us to feel beyond the scope of our immediate surroundings and deep into the cosmos. How many movies, books or other media have achieved that? Very, very few if anyIt's beyond my comprehension that such beauty and complexity could be captured on camera. This movie is a technical masterpiece that in a very rare moment of cinematography captures the unknown and presents it to us.

This movie obliterated any preconceived ideas I had about how the world works and I feel truly humbled and grateful for having had the experience of seeing it.Jodie Foster was incredible. She conveyed amounts of passion, determination and awe that I have not seen from any other actress, ever! She was able to take her acting to the level that this film required, which is literally pushing the boundaries of one's capability to feel and express that feeling to an audience. She was the right person for this job - I'm not sure anyone else could have summoned enough emotional energy to make the performance compelling enough to match the depth of the story. And I can't think of a deeper story than uncovering the mysteries of the universe. There is no question that Jodie is an integral part of this film and without her Contact does not exist.I cannot praise Contact enough. It has done for me what no other film has been able to - transported me to a different reality and convinced me that I was actually in that reality. I can without question say this has become my favourite movie of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
World powers build trillion dollar dome for Ayahuasca experimentation.,"Interesting movie with some obvious yet painless flaws in the script.Jodie kicks ass, but there are some casting disasters.Sometimes the whole thing dives into this american audience clichéd exagerated content and it gets painful to watch (for example, the mass circus near the antennas).The whole religious faith crap seems surreal, medieval, as if the inquisition's bonfires where still warm, but then we snap out of it and remember that, yes, the world is still in a medieval state of mind. The US are a curious case because medieval religious darkness co-exist with avantgarde liberal thinking.The ayahuasca trip and the communication gap between consumer and ignorant audience is a constant in life and there is only one solution: try the ******* substance yourself, ********!Not a bad movie.

Exciting Dialog Between Science and Religion,"Contact, the 1997 film directed by Robert Zemeckis, is an absolute masterpiece that deserves the highest score and stands as a testament to the power of cinema. From the moment the movie begins, it immerses the audience in a gripping narrative that is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally resonant.Jodie Foster's performance as Dr. Ellie Arroway is nothing short of outstanding. Her portrayal of a brilliant scientist who becomes the conduit for humanity's first contact with extraterrestrial intelligence is a tour de force. Foster's ability to convey the complex emotions, ranging from wonder and awe to doubt and determination, adds depth and authenticity to her character.What sets Contact apart is its exploration of profound themes, including science, faith, and the quest for knowledge beyond our world. It presents a nuanced and thought-provoking dialogue between science and religion, inviting viewers to contemplate their own beliefs and ponder the mysteries of the universe.Visually, Contact delivers a stunning and immersive experience. The scenes depicting the construction of the machine to facilitate contact with alien beings are a testament to the film's impressive visual effects, even by today's standards. Robert Zemeckis's direction shines throughout, seamlessly blending the scientific and emotional aspects of the story.Overall, Contact is a cinematic triumph that has left a lasting impact on both science fiction and philosophical cinema. It offers a rich and rewarding viewing experience that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll. Whether you are a fan of science fiction or simply appreciate thought-provoking storytelling, Contact deserves its place among the greatest films of all time, and it is an absolute must-watch for any cinephile.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Science vs. Faith,"Contact (1997), directed by Robert Zemeckis may be a Sci-Fi movie, but for me it's first of all a philosophical one. If you expect an action movie with UFO's, such as Independence Day (1996), then you picked the wrong movie.The movie's main theme is science vs. faith, and its moral is that there are things in life that one must accept without a proof. It raises questions like the existence of god, the existence of intelligent life somewhere in the universe, where we came from and what we're doing on earth (as a good example for taking some of these elements and ruining them, see K-PAX (2001)).Technical aspect is top-notch: Excellent direction (Robert Zemeckis), cinematography (Don Burgess), music (Alan Silvestri, Zemeckis' regular), script (based on the novel by late astronomer Carl Sagan), sound, editing and breath-taking special effects - while a great portion of them is ""natural"" and hard to notice.The impressive cast includes Jodie Foster (in an Oscar-worthy performance), Tom Skerritt, David Morse, James Woods, Angela Bassett, Jake Busey, the fabulous John Hurt, the always-annoying Matthew McConaughey, and many other guests.8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Amazing story but flawed characters.,"Contact is an incredible movie that touches upon the intricate subject of both science and religion as well as their somewhat opposing values and beliefs. This notion is clearly depicted in the form of human relationship, particularly speaking, the relationship between Eleanor Arroway and Palmor Joss, a scientist and a priest. Their contrasting beliefs and ideologies together with their shared love for each other shows not only the difference between science and religion but also their similarities. Both Jodie Foster and Matthew McConaughey did a brilliant job at playing their roles.Overall, it was a delightful experience to watch a fictional story of the event of alien contact.One complaint though, on my part, is that most of the antagonistic elements of the movie such as Drumlin or Kitz, are all depicted as ignorant and arrogant power figures that do nothing more than annoy and constrain the main character, which seems quite stupid in all honesty. In a global effort to make contact with an alien civilization, would such people really go as far as take advantage of an honest and talented scientist, whose discovery has literally altered the course of history, simply for the reason of personal gain? All Drumlin did was finish Arroway's sentences and steal her glory while pretending to be innocent. Same goes for Kitz, all he did was criticize when everything seemed like it went to toilet.These details might seem minor but I feel like they were a bit exaggerated really. But they are what they are, only minor annoyances, doesn't in any way affect the great story.7.5/10 would watch again.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Hallelujah!!!!,"This is coming from a non-believer, but a true fan of this movie. Hollywood has FINALLY managed to make a fantastic sci-fi movie.I can not express my feelings about this film, but I can say that it has affected me greatly. I have started questioning things, like Faith, the Universe and Mankind.This portrayal of people's reactions, interactions and actions is but brilliant. Not only do the moviemakers ask how we would react to the knowledge of another form of intelligent life, but they avoid to focus on ugly and slimy the aliens, and instead focuses on US.Jodie Foster is magnificent in this movie, and should AT LEAST have been nominated as Best Actress, and in my opinion won every award available that year. Also the movie itself should have won. Although Titanic was a good movie, and it did make me cry, it didn't touch me as much as Contact. I cry every time Ellie Arroway says: "" ..some celestial event. Poetry! They should have sent a poet. (-) I had no idea...."".",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Interstellar of the 1990s,"It's a really successful movie. Especially considering that the movie was built in 1997, you can see that it is more impressive and realistic than many movies made about science today.Towards the end of the movie, Eleanor Arroway is trying to explain the feelings that she could not prove, but lived and felt. This means that everything that is actually in religion (Islam) cannot be proved by the human mind. Some things must be accepted. In this film, atheists can see that there is some evidence of dialogue to support their own views. But at the end of the movie, when they see what I wrote above, they must understand that they are wrong.
(I exclude exploding the space shuttle made by exploiting religion.)References are made to many things in the movie. If you watch the movie paying attention to every detail, you will notice them. Although Eleanor made the discovery himself, David Drumli stole it from him; Tesla-Edison was a reference to the duo. I don't think the new generation that has grown up with technology in 2019 can understand this. All of the current technology has been through the long-term thinking sponsor companies with the character of ""S.R HADDEN"". The value of nothing is not understood in its own time.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
How to reason religion for the '90s,"Let's start by saying, I enjoyed Contact and although I will be criticizing the movie here my overall impression remains a fairly good one.The movie begins very well introducing the characters, for the most part, completely.  The first moment at which maybe I stepped slightly back from the film was that when Palmer was introduced.  It seemed that his character was intended to be some sort of 'all knowing' advisor and he is sustained in this way throughout the film.The build-up and release of suspense to and during the first detection of the signal is excellent and I was preparing myself for a very thought provoking movie to continue the almost flawless beginning.  Unfortunately at this point I was somewhat disappointed.  Suddenly a character (Hadden) is introduced who seems like he's been plucked straight out of a James Bond movie.  From this point onwards the movie becomes less believable.Increasingly throughout I felt that Ellie's relationship with Palmer was implausible and that their two completely conflicting backgrounds could have been better argued.  I don't believe that Jody Foster's character was intended to be as weak hearted as she acted.The middle of the movie contains your usual combination of 'step back and see what the rest of the world is doing' scenes and the somewhat loose development of Ellie and Palmers relationship.  This leads to the second focus point - the construction and use of the machine.The end of Ellies journey, I feel, although far better than the kind of 'tentacled alien monster' story which it could have turned into, answered too many questions.  The special effects on the other hand were fantastic.The religious / spiritual untertones in the film came to their conclusion in the final few minutes when Ellie states that she has experienced something which has changed her forever, but which she can't prove (I forget the exact quote).  This makes a perfect analogy with Palmers similar statement earlier on in the movie when he is explaining why he preaches hence my summary 'how to reason religion for the 90s'.  I felt the argument used all the time in religion / science debates 'Science can't proove everything so this makes religion more plausible' being reiterated when the movie could have taken a new and unique perspective.A few quite severe plot flaws added to my disbelief towards the end of the movie also.  For example - How would Hadden ever have created the plans for creating a machine like the one shown genius or not?Summarising, I thought that the movie constructed in the first third, far more potential for itself than it fulfilled, and rather than dealing with the question it asked, it avoided it.  Combined with a few unbelievable plot elements this closed up much potential for further speculation.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
We are not ready for 'contact',"Good film if no other reason it made the audience think! Personally I don't think alien civilisation would want to contact us at this moment in our evolution. It's not a question of surviving our technological adolescence - It's more a question of surviving our ridiculous belief(s) adolescence. No person on this planet can prove or disprove the existence of God and the fact that millions of us are willing to attach ourselves to 'blind' faith and (some) kill in the name of it says so much - put simply we are not ready - Until we can collectively address the issue with clear minds we are in no fit state to move forward and a highly evolved alien intellect would know this. Unfortunately I fear it will be many generations down the line before we put away our religious icons and truly open our collective minds. I for one are quite open to the possibility that a higher intelligence put the ingredients in the 'pot' to create our universe, but like everyone else I cannot prove it and would not have the arrogance to preach it to others. Yes I think its likely that higher intelligence exist around the galaxy and beyond, its just possible one of them may be aware of our existence through the premise of the film (electromagnetic broadcast) - but I think there methods of contact or more likely observation would be so sophisticated we wouldn't recognise it. And in any event, as I said earlier we need to rationalise our thoughts. The most telling scene in the whole movie was the 'carnival' in the car-park - says it all really.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The biggest existential questions,This is my favorite movie. I admire Carl Sagan deeply as he is the one who made me appreciate science and think about our place in this Universe.I like how this film reveals the different reactions of people on something because everyone believes their own truth. I also appreciate the most the scientific accuracy as if right now you can rarely find that in sci-fi movies.,10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Comments from a personal discussion with the late Carl.,"Having met Carl Sagan in 1974, when he and his friend Frank Drake were in Australia, I have the benefits of an actual discussion with him on this subject that is of relevance to this movie and may be of interest.Carl Sagan's philosophy was a simple and very powerful one. Here is my understanding of it.If we discover intelligent life ""somewhere"", it will be the most important discovery we will ever make.Not because of any ""scientific"" knowledge that we can exchange; but because we will then no longer be the only intelligent life form.Thus, we will be able to review everything that we think we know about ourselves, because finally we will have another viewpoint, another reference point. (Aside: I realized this analogy many years later. If you learn to speak a second language, this will give you a different point of view on your primary language. This will give you a faint glimmer of what this concept is all about).It is these insights into everything that we think we know about ourselves that will be the greatest value of this realization.As a secondary point, the search for other intelligence, even if a complete ""failure"", will move us great steps in this direction. Thus, the search itself will be of great potential value.As very close secondary issues, made clear in the book ""Cosmos"" (which is a worthwhile ""primer"" before reading ""Contact""), Carl had very negative opinions on how the religions and the military had abused their positions in what he called the ""stewardship"" of our planet. He thought that their points of view were far too narrow in the context of the power and responsibility that they claimed in the leadership of the direction of thinking on this planet.""Contact"" (the book), then, is essentially Carl's personal ""typical best case"" scenario of an example of how all of this might happen. To see this, when you read the book, pay as much attention to things that happen in the ""background"" as you do to the main story.Finally, we come to the movie, which of necessity covers only a small fraction of the material contained in the book. My understanding is that he was involved in the making of the movie as best he could; and was reasonably pleased with the efforts that he saw.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Good Epic Film...,"My comment will be focused not on the subject of the film but on the films characteristics themselves. In cinema there are some main anchors points to which you can attach a film piece to and ""Contact"" is tagged to a very powerful one - an EPIC FILM. The difference between epic film ""wanna  be"" and real epic films, is that the real ones seem to have been a part of your life once the credits start to roll. All of us know this feeling very well, as we have all seen ""The Godfather"". Epic films usually tend to go outside the realms of the genre they were meant to be. That is why you can not say that ""Contact"" is an action or an action flick, even though it has most characteristics of both. There is drama in there too but its not that either, it's an epic film. Camera-work is on a decent level. Effects are well done. The film was not ruined by intolerable clichés phrases or dialogs. The plot was a hard one to get through, if you don't know what you're doing but that is not the case with Mr. Zemeckis. No matter of how controversial the topic may be to the audience, it is and will remain, as one of the thumbs up films of the 90's archives, because as far as cinematographic arts criteria go it is surely above the mediocre.A good example of an epic film.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Absolute masterpiece every human should watch,"Jodi Foster should be the ambassador of humans based on this film. You can tell she put a lot emotional effort into her performance. The movie is about the theory of wormholes and Jodi Foster's character is chosen to go through first. Trust me the visuals towards the end of this film are extremely well done. The movie does get a little slow towards the middle, but it was building up to an awesome thoughtful journey. There was some quirky casting and funny costumes.For example there was a terrorist that looked comically evil. He looked like an evil character from Zoolander. Even with that the film is still a solid 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Are we alone?,"""Contact"" from 1997, directed by master Robert Zemeckis (""Back to the Future"" ""Forrest Gump"" ""Cast Away"") and based on Carl Sagan's novel, is a splendid film that combines science fiction, philosophy, and the human yearning to find meaning in an unimaginablely vast universe. The movie follows SETI astronomer Dr. Ellie Arroway, portrayed intensely by Jodie Foster, whose relentless quest for proof of extraterrestrial life is both intellectually stimulating and deeply emotional. The script, rich with crisp dialogue, explores themes of faith versus reason, making viewers question their own beliefs while remaining captivated by the stunning visual effects and the hauntingly beautiful music score by Alan Silvestri. The portrayal of complex characters, especially the dynamic between Ellie and the enigmatic Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey), adds several layers to the narrative, creating a profound sense of urgency and hope. Also featured are Tom Skerritt, James Woods, Jake Busey, David Morse, and Jena Malone. Zemeckis's direction is both ambitious and intimate, effectively capturing the vastness of space and the profound question of ""are we alone in the universe,"" alongside the intricacies of human connections and squabbles. This film resonates on multiple levels, with a powerful and completely unique opening scene that sets the stage brilliantly for what's to come. Absorbing and compelling filmmaking from beginning to end.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Masterpiece of Sci-Fi,"I'm not a big fan of Carl Sagan, but the way they made this movie makes it a master piece of a drama, and a science fiction.There's no one element that stands out in this movie (except the excellent deliveries by Jodi Foster), but everything being done at such high quality is what makes this movie a gem from the '90s. On location scenes are beautiful, as are the in studio scenes. Character development in the story is excellent with each character getting their place in the story. That's pretty much all the element you need to make a fine science fiction movie.One other thing that stands out is that there's no conflict in this movie except human ones. It's not about war, destruction, or hysteria that drives the story. It's about new frontier, and first contact. I wish newer movies would show some originality at this level, and not rely on destruction, and conflict as their sole plot.This movie scores high from all angles, and that's what makes it superb.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
wow!,"I must say, this is quite an amazing and beautiful movie. It really gets you thinking.. We are not the only species living. Earth and the planets aren't the only things existing to hold other species. It's truly amazing how little and insignificant us and our problems are when we are walking on this tiny earth. How much information do our little brains know? Scientists believe they know everything through cold, hard evidence. The matter of the fact is that this scientist found out many unknown facts through faith and memory. She experienced a memorable journey out of this world that has changed her opinions and visions of life in extraordinary ways. She thinks she knows enough, but she comes back with unexplainable events capable of confusing everyone else that comes across her. She left many people with questions and disbelief. So how much do we know? This movie will get you thinking. I recommend this over any other movie that has been made after 2005. These are the movies with true meaning and depth that I would love to see again in this century. Some of you might want some intense action and amazing effects but I will assure you, -Contact- is very much worth your time and will leave you with unanswered questions about what really goes on above and beyond this planet.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Interesting Movie,"I found Contact interesting. I thought Robert Z did a good job of painting a great picture of the main character Ellie to know how she ticks. It was the proverbial ""religion vs science"" movie but I thought it was done rather well. I have never read the book, but I had the feeling that Robert Z watered-down Sagan's strong evolution theory philosophy (""no God"") in the movie. Although Ellie is agnostic at best, I did appreciate why she was (ie her Sunday school experience and the comments of the religious guy, both when she was young). I expected more ""God vs Science"" discussions in the movie, but the ones featured caught my attention, particular the conversation on the ballroom balcony.The climax was interesting, but not what I expected, which is disappointing. In the end, there is a slight twist to the ""religion vs science"" melodrama, which I thought would raise some eyebrows among some hardcore atheists and scientific types.Overall, one of the more intelligent Sci-fi movies I have seen in a while.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Awe-inspiring, fascinating science fiction drama.","`Contact' is one of the most thought-provoking, realistic and remarkable movies I have seen in quite a while. It falls into the often-ignored sub-genre of the sci-fi drama. Of course this is something which isn't attempted very often, because it is so hard to get the mixture just right. On a normal basis, the science fiction movie is a gung-ho `man vs. aliens' affair, but it could not be further away from that in `Contact'. This is truly one of the most intelligent, remarkably executed sci-fi movies you will see in quite a while.It is the thinking mans movie, but that's not to say that it's anything like the over-rated and often pretentious `2001: A Space Oddessy'. Unlike that picture, `Contact' engages the mind from the very start- and a fantastic opening at that. We see the planets flying past as we move further and further away from the Sun, whilst gradually hearing a radio signal move back in time until it eventually disappears. This is a very hard act to follow, but it maintains that thrilling peak for the entire 153 minute running time. The pace is a noticeably slow one, but that adds to the degree of intensity and interest.I have always been a fan of Robert Zemeckis' movies and this is right up there with `Back to the Future' as one of his best movies. Mastered almost every genre by now, he perfectly balances science fiction and drama, science and religion, interest and thrill, satisfaction and entertainment. Of course all other supporting work from behind the camera is as good as one could possibly expect. A brilliant, but and always evident score plays throughout, courtesy of Alan Silvestri. The cinematography and art direction were always going to be a hard thing to handle in a film like this. It is a serious and realistic sci-fi that has to lose the gung-ho effect. The serenity of space and the planet `Vega' is a consistent treat for the eyes and a tranquil image (different from the one that we're probably used to).Backing this is up is superb and consistently humane performances from the cast. Obviously leading the pack is Jodie Foster giving yet another mesmerising performances. While this type of film wouldn't be considered as an actor's piece, she brings just the right amount of gusto, determination and deep down vulnerability. This is definitely one of Matthew McConaughey's better movies- far superior to the likes of `EDtv' and `How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days'. Tremendous support from the likes of Tom Skerritt (Alien, Top Gun), James Woods, Angela Bassett, David Morse, John Hurt, Rob Lowe and William Fichtner. Also a bunch of cameos from CNN presenters, reporters, scientist, even Bill Clinton himself! It's original and highly convincing how they digitally added him in to certain scenes, instead of using some fictitious President.A realistic, thought-provoking and often astonishing piece of work, `Contact' is one of the best science fiction movies in years. If you want an `Independence Day' like action movie working on the principle of `Die- aliens-die!' then this probably isn't the film for you. Otherwise, this is a remarkable, unpretentious piece of work that should rightfully be in the IMDb Top 250. My IMDb rating: 8.1/10.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Are We Alone in the Universe?,"As someone who believes that there are literally trillions of inhabited planets out there in the cosmic playground of outer space and that much about their origins and destiny (as well as those pertaining to our own planet) have been revealed and documented within the last century in a series of 196 Papers known collectively as The Urantia Papers (or The Urantia Book) that were authored by various Beings-Not-Of-This-Realm who were commissioned to bestow this epochal revelation upon our planet including translating it into the English language (since English is not the native tongue of either our local universe of Nebadon or our superuniverse of Orvonton or of the Paradise-Havona Central Universe of Divine Perfection which is the dwelling place of the eternal God and around which everything else and everyone else revolves in accordance with the superuniverse plans of evolutionary progress and spiritual attainment), I was predictably pleased to watch a movie that to me asked: Are we really all alone in the universe of universes with this vast enormity of wasted space encircling us like lifeless set decoration or are we rather a part of some gigantic undertaking that is fusing perfection and imperfection and blending science and religion into one creatively unfolding project that is beyond our mortal comprehension to fully fathom and that involves other living beings on other inhabited planets who are in the truest sense, our cosmic cousins? So when I gaze into the starry heavens at the countless suns of space, I marvel at how seemingly insignificant it would superficially appear that our planet is and yet just as this movie highlighted the important role that faith plays whether in regards to believing in a Higher Power or believing in the existence of alien beings far removed from our galactic proximity, I do have faith that our sphere (Urantia) is just as precisely administered and just as lovingly fostered as if it were the only inhabited world in all existence.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"The best Science Fiction movie since ""2001: A Space Odyssey""","This movie reminds us how superb Science Fiction can be when done properly. It belongs in the same league as a handful of SF classics such as Kubricks 2001: A Space Odyssey.This is an intelligent and convincing story that for once pleases the science buffs as well as the mass audiences. The script is intelligent and thought provoking. The movie does not rely on seducing the viewer with special effects, as so many do these days.Excellent performance from Jodi Foster as the dedicated scientist who believes in her work. John Hurt's Haddon is simply superb. However, I found Matthew McConaughey's character Palmer Joss unconvincing and the fact that he finds his way into the Whitehouse struck me implausible. Tom Skerrit's character ""Drumlin"" was also weak and stereotyped. The rest of the performances were OK, and it's even got Bill Clinton in it playing himself!!!The message of this movie is interesting, and gives it a philosophical dimension: That there is a uncrossable gulf between the mind that can only accept empiricism as reality, and the mind that can knows that subjective experience can be just as real. Jodi Foster's character is given an experience comparable to a subjective experience that is quite real but which she cannot share or prove, and through this she is able to finally understand that there may be something in spiritual reality after all.In summary, I'd say this movie is as a good a science fiction film as you're going to get.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Contact (1997),"Young Ellie: Dad, do you think there's people on other planets? Ted Arroway: I don't know, Sparks. But I guess I'd say if it is just us... seems like an awful waste of space.Contact is a science-fiction film written by the late astronomer Carl Sagan. The title ""Contact"" refers to the main plot, in which the human race makes contact with intelligent extraterrestrial life for the first time. However, it has a double meaning, because the title also refers to the contact made between human beings, and how significant events can effect the dynamics between various groups of human beings.Contact is about Ellie Arroway, a brilliant astronomer who passionately supports the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence project, a passion which is not reciprocated by those around her. One day, after years and years of listening to various radio frequencies across the universe, she finally hears a signal coming from the star Vega. This signal is unmistakably intelligent, as it consists of every prime number between 1 and 101. Upon closer inspection, something even deeper is discovered about the message, and what follows is an account of how this message effects the human race, including the political, religious, and the economic ramifications.Carl Sagan was a staunch humanist, who believed strongly in the value of human ingenuity, and our potential to be accepted into a fictional galactic community which he wrote about often, consisting of the populations of extraterrestrial species on other star systems and planets. Contact most definitely incorporates all of these ideas, and is unmistakably Sagan in it's depth of inspiration, emotional content, and hope for humanity.This is a film that has always stayed with me; it's a deeply moving and profound piece of art that poses serious intellectual questions, but at the same time makes an argument that not everything can be rationalized, including life, love, faith, and the existence of God. At its core, the film is a study... a study of the interactions between human beings, and the methods human beings will utilize in order to make sense of their existence on this ""pale blue dot"" of ours, whether it be by science, religion, destruction, or love.It's not a perfect film, but it's one that has inspired me greatly; I wouldn't be the same without it.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Really good take on science vs. faith,"It was nearly the turn of the millennium and we'd amassed in less than a century more science and technological prowess than in all of human history. People were in for that perennial question about science and faith. ""Contact"" made great work of it. Passionate astronomer Ellie Arroway's (Jodie Foster) struggle for the funding of her ""pure research"" project is crowned by her discovery of extraterrestrial intelligence and she tries to keep her composure while her boss David Drumlin steals the spotlight and credit every step of the way. She has a one-night stand with a religious writer, Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey), who decries the pervasive influence of science and technology in everyday life and insists that science couldn't answer all the questions we got.

Unpretentious and effective,"For sci-fi, this is brainy (what would one expect from the late Carl Sagan?), clever, humorous, coherent, and family-friendly. The pretext is that we have gotten signals from life out in space -- life that has gotten the worst possible introduction from humanity, an early television signal from the Third Reich (nazi Germany, of course). Humanity gets plans for a machine that can supposedly get people elsewhere in the universe... a sort of Heaven.To be sure, I am not convinced that the machine so much gets people to the Other Side and doesn't create the illusion by analyzing the thoughts of its 'passengers' -- but the ambiguity looks intentional.The satire of anti-rational religious figures, UFO cultists, political extremists, and the like is exactly as one would expect from Sagan, someone who long told us that space travel to the stars would be so difficult that it might not be worth the effort.

The opening is so unique, confident, clear, and effective that I know I'm in the exact right hands to tell this story. Robert Zemeckis took over the pre-production efforts after the studio fired George Miller, was granted full artistic control including final cut, and built off of what Miller had established to tell the filmed version of Carl Sagan's novel about alien contact. I'd love to see what Miller would have done, but it's hard to imagine a better combination of director and material than Zemeckis and Contact. Zemeckis is inventive technically on par with Spielberg, has the same kind of gentle humanism throughout his work, but he also is firmer in his commitments to where stories should go.Since I made so much of how this movie starts so well, let me talk about that for a moment. It's an extravagant special effects shot that tracks back from earth, picking up speed and going further and further into deep space, passing out of our planetary system, our galaxy, and even further until we get a sense of how small our world is in the scope of the universe. This is matched by the sound of radio waves, dominated close to earth by contemporary radio and television signals, and going backwards in time until we can hear the first television signal powerful enough to be sent into space some ways away for a half second (that becomes important later). After that, it's silence as we get a stronger sense of just how much space is out there. It's a perfect start to this film.Ellie Arroway is a scientist who works for SETI, using time on large radio telescopes to search the stars for signs of alien life. She's brilliant and eagerly directing her career down a dead end according to David Drumlin, the president's science advisor who has control over funding and satellite time. Eventually fired, Ellie and a small team of like-minded scientists find funding from a large corporation's funding arm, Hadden Industries. Using this money, they listen to the stars until the stars start speaking.There are a couple of personal stories going on at the same time as the plot. The first deals with Ellie's father who died when she was nine. Using flashbacks, we see how her widow father lovingly guided her first steps into searching for answers in the stars with a telescope and a HAM radio. He dies of a heart attack one night when they're supposed to stargaze, and she rejects the local priest's explanation of God's will, but she still misses her father. She still needs answers, so she runs to her radio and calls out to her dad. The other personal story deals with Palmer Joss, a man who left the seminary because he couldn't give up the sins of the flesh, who is writing a book about the lack of meaning in a world dominated by science. He looks and sounds like Matthew McConaughey, so her immediate sensual desire seems to be understandable, but she can't commit. Ellie looks to the stars for meaning, not to the Earth. Science is her God, to put it another way, and she feels like she needs nothing else.Now, to talk about a Robert Zemeckis movie without highlighting at least one great individual sequence feels empty, so I shall tackle that now. The first appearance of the signal from space is great, just so great. It comes as a series of pulses announcing the signal's presence to the world that's listening. Ellie's efforts to speed into the command center from an isolated spot among the 27 radio telescopes, shouting commands over her radio while her fellow scientists try to catch up with her orders, the building music around it, and the frantic early steps and simply trying to capture and verify what they're hearing is an amazing combination of visually effective storytelling, editing, and sound design that stands as one of Zemeckis' finest single sequences. And this movie is only about a third done. There's a lot more greatness to come.The signal from space, that demonstrated intelligence through the use of prime numbers, recalls the attentions of the world, and the US government suddenly descends on Ellie's quiet little stargazing spot. Drumlin arrives alongside the National Security Advisor Michael Kitz. From the moment Drumlin shows up, he's wresting control and the credit away from Ellie, and Ellie barely seems to realize how bad it is. She can see it, but she doesn't realize how hard she needs to fight it. It doesn't help when the first signal has its visual aspects revealed to show Hitler's introduction to the 1936 Olympic Games.Now, one thing this movie does with surprising intelligence is how it handles a variety of reactions from the world to the news. The cults that rise up both in support and in rejection outside the radio telescope farm feel like the sort of mix of crazy humanity would cook up, but they're mostly a sideshow. The central reaction is Ellie's, and she's counterbalanced by Joss. Ellie looks out at these people with a mix of pity, confusion, and a little bit of fear. The irony is that both she and the sideshow carnival are looking towards Vega, the source of the message, as a source of meaning and truth, the exact sort of thing that Joss was saying was absent in our modern science-driven world. Ellie's journey ends up being one of humility and faith as she realizes the limits of her own experience. It ends up recalling Arthur C. Clarke's Third Law: ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.""So, the message has plans for a giant machine hidden inside it. S.R. Hadden, the reclusive billionaire who resembles Howard Hughes (and would be modeled after Elon Musk if made today) figures out the primer to decode the language, and the world is off to spend almost half a trillion dollars to build it. The machine has a capsule that carries one person, and Ellie and Drumlin are both up for the seat. Drumlin, once again, steps on Ellie's toes and she takes it. That's not really a criticism of her character, mind you. Ellie is a professional working in a tough bureaucratic setting. She acts like a professional when she gets outmaneuvered by Drumlin, eventually losing the prized seat to him. It would be out of character for her to, while still working on the project, to break down into tears and recriminations against him. She can do that when her funding gets pulled near the beginning of the film, but not when she's spent time learning to be a team player with a desire to see the project through to the end.When a religious extremist sneaks into the completed site and blows it and Drumlin up, the world thinks it has wasted a gob of money on a project that went nowhere until Hadden shows up with another machine built in Japan. Two machines for the price of two. Ellie ends up the pilot and gets sent through.Now, the movie as a whole gets a lot of praise, but that tends to end when Ellie reaches her destination. The trip out is tense and beautiful in equal measure. The sequence that sends the pod through the machine is another great suspense sequence, but it's when Ellie gets to that beach built off of her memory of a drawing she made of Pensacola as a child and the alien visiting her in the form of her father that people lose faith with the film. They wanted to see an alien, and they see a great alien design, not just David Morse. However, I think that Zemeckis leaned towards the lesson that Kubrick learned while making 2001: A Space Odyssey. No alien will ever life up to the audience's imagination. The design will always be too terrestrial in nature. So, instead of going to spectacle, which he gave in the trip there to the beach, Zemeckis relies heavily on Ellie's emotional journey, and I think it works. Ellie started her love of space mixed with the tragedy of her father's death. Some part of her had mixed the idea of science and the soul into an idea that if she could hear far enough, she could see her dad again, and suddenly there, millions and millions of light years away from Earth, she sees him again. There's an emotional release from her as she fulfills what she had dreamed of as a girl, something relatable to the audience. At the same time, she sees her journey from a cosmic point of view as the first step out of many (there are echoes of Clarke's assertion that we are a child race here).When Ellie comes back, she has no proof over her journey, just her lived experience. She cannot prove that what she saw was real, but she must still try and convince the world that they did not waste their time and money on the project. Her desire to be believed becomes an echo of Joss's earlier arguments in favor of faith in God, a fascinating parallel. She can prove that this machine really did as much as she asserts as well as Joss can prove the existence of God. I imagine it costs a fortune to simply run the machine a single time, so I can understand why people wouldn't be jumping at the prospect of funding another trip just to see if what she said was right.It's a wonderfully intelligent film that embraces complexity in several forms. Acting is really good across the board, especially from Jodie Foster as Ellie. It reaches for a real sense of awe and nearly accomplishes it, which is a hard thing to do in general, all while telling its story well. This is a great film, and it may be the best Zemeckis ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A brilliant, awe-inspiring sci-fi drama.","9.5 out of 10Jodie Foster stars as a radio astronomer who receives a signal from outer space, and thus begins a media frenzy of speculation over the signal's origin, its purpose and its intent.  This brilliant sci-fi drama from director Robert Zemeckis achieves heights of awe-inspiring visuals and ideas not seen since 2001: A Space Odyssey, and in its approach to develop Foster's character, surpasses even that film. I'd like to say more about the movie, about its themes and controversial debates, but much of the joy of watching Contact is discovering how the plot unfolds and witnessing the visual surprises for yourself (suffice to say that the opening and closing segments are among the most beautiful passages ever seen on film).

Very important film,"This movie is important because it tries to show what people are really trying to find in religion. In other words, the actually real and tangible parts of religion. It does this without resorting to absurdities.Speaking of absurdities: The movie tries to stay scientifically correct as much as possible, with very few plot holes. You can enjoy the mystery and adventure, and realize that you don't need complete fantasy to be amazed at what the universe could possibly offer.Jodie Foster is just amazing in this movie, playing an intelligent and morally good person with the best interests of humanity in focus.Matthew McConaughey plays well as a weak person but one who is also good at connecting with a larger less intelligent audience with whom his character share a lot of traits and ideas.Jake Busey's role as the explosive preacher might not be mentioned a lot, but I'd like to give credit here.

"Almost Heaven, Pensacola","Tragedy during a meteor shower in her childhood helps shape the character of atheist astronomer Jodie Foster (as Eleanor ""Ellie"" Ann Arroway). Ms. Foster works for the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI), which monitors signals from space. Though tirelessly dedicating her hours to listing for meaning in the static of space blips, Foster takes time out for a sexual encounter when she meets handsome wavy-haired Matthew McConaughey (as Palmer Joss). Opposites attract as Mr. McConaughey is a deeply religious man. They want to mate some more, but Foster moves on when her SETI funding source is threatened...Sometime Robert Zemeckis doesn't seem like he was in Carl Sagan's ""Contact"" book...So, Foster leaves McConaughey's telephone number behind, after she packs. We see her place McConaughey's number by the telephone next to the bed where they played ""hide the telescope"". The reason for this scene is unexplained, so we'll just have to assume McConaughey's number is being left for the next occupant. Or, maybe the cleaning person. Apparently, Foster's suitcases are jammed, and/or she's one of those people who don't like putting anything in her pockets. Really, she couldn't possibly have disposed of the paper any other way, because we need to play up this ""romance"" and widen the audience...Also regrettable is the film's muddying of the ""science"" versus ""religion"" waters...Anything more on that subject could affect your viewing pleasure. Getting beyond the criticism (and physics improbabilities), you still get an exciting adventure. Foster offers up another strong characterization; amazingly, she has acquired an alien receptive look. The special effects are outstanding, and enough of Mr. Sagan's spacey thoughtfulness remains. The use of ""real"" people (Bill Clinton, Larry King) is interesting and may someday lose the datedness; until then, Rob Lowe is a hilarious stand in for Ralph Reed. Any re-make should play up a romance between ""Ellie"" and ""Kent Clark"" (blindly played by William Fichtner).******* Contact (7/11/97) Robert Zemeckis ~ Jodie Foster, William Fichtner, Matthew McConaughey, Tom Skerritt",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

An oft misunderstood classic,"Some movies are too smart for their own good. Contact is one of these, presenting the fault-lines between science and religion in a poignant, character-driven tour de force while subtly judging on their respective merits. Consequently, the ""big picture"" may be lost on some viewers.The film follows Dr. Ellie Arroway, an ostracized astronomer whose search for extraterrestrial life has effectively driven her into professional exile, as she proves the world wrong by discovering an alien transmission from Vega. Throughout, she relies on her unwavering faith in science, which is juxtaposed against the spiritual faith of her on again, off again beau. Her quixotic idealism is also tested by more opportunistic elements of the scientific world, which seize upon her discovery and hijack its publicity. The real wildcards include an old, rich eccentric who secretly backs Arroway as ""the game of the millennium"" unfolds, and a reactionary terrorist group.The relationships between the scientists, politicians, and even nations involved in this ""game"" give the movie its flavor and character depth, but the real complexity lies in the motivations behind the principal players, as well as the ultimate revelation that Arroway makes at the end of the film. A thousand words cannot do justice to the philosophical questions that it asks. For instance, what is God? Why do we believe in him? Is it because we're alone? If we shouldn't believe in God because he can't be seen, then what about love?There is not much I can add to the other analyses given, but I hope that viewers watch the movie with their own faith and their own questions in mind. If you are a born again Christian, or an Atheist, or whatever, does this movie reinforce your own belief? How should science and religion interact?I feel the final act taught Dr. Arroway that her faith in her journey, and by extension her very faith in science, are inherently subjective, but that they are no less profound or true for being so. It also shows that the truth may be forever hidden, thus it needs to be taken on our faith alone. Perhaps you'll see it differently.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Finally! Some intelligent science fiction!,"I love this movie. The special effects seemed to be there to support the plot, rather than to be there just to dazzle. The plot actually dealt with intelligent themes, especially theology which usually scares away screenwriters.True, it's not perfect. I didn't believe that someone as young as Palmer Ross would be appointed to take care of the ""religious"" part of the decision committee, especially since he isn't even ordained. I could've done without the Tom Skerrit character and the subplot of him winning and then dying. And it was very distracting and unnecessary to have Clinton in it.These are minor carps. And more than made up for by sequences showing that the first signal returned was Hitler. How chilling. Or the opening sequence which uses the powerful sound of complete silence.Those I've encouraged to see it were disappointed for the most part. There were no big climaxes or explosions or zooming spaceships with overlords in cool imposing costumes. Instead they had to endure emotions, philosophy, theology, and science. The concept of thinking during a movie turned them off. To them the definition of ""entertainment"" is to turn the brain off and forget the rest of the world for two hours.If this is your movie philosophy, you may prefer empty-headed but special-effects sci-fi extravaganzas like Independence Day. If you don't mind a science fiction film of a slower pace that offers riches to your mind, you'll enjoy Contact.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Rivetting, brilliant, and beautiful.","In my opinion, Contact is the best film adaptation of a speculative-fiction book to date.

That was my first exposure to Carl Sagan.The movie ""Contact"" was based on the book written by Carl Sagan. Sagan died while the movie was in production. Sagan was an atheist, and the atheist view is very prevalent in the movie. The only religious references are that of the former priest Palmer Joss, who eventually becomes Clinton's spiritual adviser, how appropriate, and the weasel who is David Drumlin.I think the movie could have been better if we weren't brow beaten with the atheist and humanist viewpoint.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Life-Affirming Epic Imagining Universal Concerns We All Have,"Contact is a $90 million outer space film made by Hollywood with major stars from the director of Who Framed Roger Rabbit and the Back to the Future trilogy, and yet has a profound effect that no viewer can escape, a universal concern that we all have. Is it not probable that intelligent life exists somewhere else in the universe? And, what would have to happen for people to reject belief in a god?There is a fascinating point at which the story becomes ambiguous. After two hours of watching Jodie Foster's earnest, ambitious and brilliant heroine fight to discover life beyond earth, she has an experience that cannot be explained with full certainty, neither by the filmmakers or the audience, yet it affirms our life and our existence, that even if we ever make contact with alien life, we may only find that sharing existence with them is all that makes it feel significant. The film is a spectacle, yes, but there is so much surrounding that spectacle, the explosions, whorls of light, and tragic and infuriating midpoint of the story. It is a narrative expression, and incidental elegy, of Carl Sagan's work and ideas, urging human beings to realize that we are not core essence of existence, that we are an infinitesimal fraction. It is a deeply upsetting thought to many people, but it only makes our millions of years of survival and persistence unthinkable and dear.Robert Zemeckis's often under-appreciated philosophical epic clearly pivots the question of whether intelligent life exists on other planets, but it also explores how belief is proved. And regardless of the build-up to its cataclysmal climax, it doggedly hinges upon that theme. Foster and the character of Matthew McConaughey's function as counterpoints to each other, seeming at first to be a token subplot concerning badly gratuitous love interests, but their relationship develops far, far beyond that. They are an important dynamic that balances her striving for palpable evidence and unrelenting intellectualizing with his dogmatic point of view through faith and personal feelings. The movie is honest and loyal to what is historically proved to be realistic in its view of religion and science clashing constantly throughout the story, with some surprisingly rough consequences.Foster's methodical crusade is lonely, just like we are all alone. She just happens to be more in touch with this formidable feeling. Her boss, a corporate attention whore played by Tom Skerritt, tells her the field of search for extraterrestrial life is professional suicide. But that's the only reason she's in this profession. She's made fun of, but her consumption sits complicated with personal obsessions. With her father, played with very real vibes by David Morse, she shared the enthusiasm of picking up obscure station signals on their amateur radio apparatus. He died while she was still young, and she became unflappable that by some means, sooner or later, she could contact him. This belief is at issue with the certitude that she does not believe in God or the paranormal. Her search for extraterrestrial life is her interpretation of that childhood right. Contemplating the infinity and inscrutability of the universe, you're inclined to clarify it with a supposition like God, but one doubts that a God isn't a redaction that fosters our self-worth in the face of something around which we cannot get our mind.Movies like Contact clarify why most sci-fi blockbusters and other humanistically solipsistic space films relinquish me with dry and unfulfilled feelings. When I look up at the sky at night, when I see footage of the arrival of the research vehicles on Mars or the moon, when I read about astronomy and its variants that deal with its overall configuration and evolution, I graze a mental phoenix. Space and time are so immeasurable in all respects, and our existence is so momentary, that all we know is like one infinitesimal clue in an unimaginably colossal black, well, space. Has another life-sustaining world existed and determined more? We've only been listening for roughly forty years. A beacon's probability of getting to us at the fitting time are so far flung. Can one really allow their preexisting faiths obstruct them from the natural curiosity and inconceivable astonishment?Zemeckis fills his movie with formulaically defined but nonetheless interesting characters, played by particularly good actors. There is John Hurt's enigmatic billionaire who spends his life in the skies within his jet, landing only sparingly. He follows Foster's search and beckons his own boundless assets. And there are two presidential advisers, James Woods and Angela Bassett, who, in the ritual of American alien movies, see the signals as a likely menace to earth. But the film's honest depiction of the world's most influential ideologies in the chasm of its own, their consideration of an alien threat seems more of a real-life likelihood than that of Hollywood.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Some movies teach you something,"This is one of that kind of movies that leave you with the feeling that you have learned something by watching at it. I have always respected Carl Sagan since I saw the Cosmos TV series when I was just a boy. It's not only that he shows how science is, but puts so much heart on it, so much illusion that eventually you have to say ""thank you, Mr. Sagan"", because you have really been ""infected"" by his ""disease"": the quest for knowledge and the joy of knowing. The same spirit lies on this film: we've been told many things that science knows nowadays, the script lefts the door open to develop our fantasies and illusions... but stops on time before figuring out too many things that could mislead us because we really don't know them yet. I also want to thank Sagan, Foster and all the people responsible of the script for showing the due respect to the religious feeling of most people, although pointing out the problems and paradoxes that the events of this film would cause if they really happen. I learned very much with this story about the wonder of being, the marvels of Universe, about respect and prudence. Again, thank you, Mr. Sagan",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Enjoyable, though not for all ages.","The controversy generated by this movie is astounding. Many claim that the ages-old battle between Church and Science, began with Carl Sagan; an outrageous lie of ignorance, at best. The fundamental differences in belief go back as far as the days of Constantine and court magicians. Alchemists were persecuted by the Church for heretical acts, and ... oh, but this is useless.This film goes a long way towards outlining the governmental interferences known to take place between ufologists and ""real"" scientists who, infuriatingly, side with the Church where extraterrestrial life is concerned...or they did until the last few years. Now, it is considered acceptable to admit that there ""may be"" other life out there, and many of Sagan's theories are considered an axiom today, such as his often-quoted philosophy, that ""...if humans are the only life in the universe it would be a terrible waste of space."" At the heart of Contact, you are taken along one woman's journey to self-discovery, but all around her, others are making their own discoveries, even if they are too selfish and duplicitous to share them with her. Often, in real life, these people are just too self-involved to realize that they have HAD an epiphany and it soon goes away.But at any rate, Contact delivers awesome entertainment, some poignant drama, and a fluid and stylistic presentation from Sagan and Zemeckis. It's a bit dated, but not so much as to detract from one's enjoyment. This is a really good movie, with a decent budget, and it enjoys an impressive rating here at IMDb (to be so preachy). I would say it would be a decent Friday/Saturday night's viewing, as long as the subject matter is appealing to the audience.Foster delivers a genuine performance in which the viewer has no choice but to subscribe to her character, and become embroiled in her intrigue. A top row performance, but I have never seen Foster give any less, even as a child star.Fichtner is a tremendous talent as a character actor, and he does not fail herein to engage. You should check out some of his other, more flamboyant, performances. That man can ACT!

"Contact is great science fiction, one of the most realistic I've seen","Contact is great science fiction, one of the most realistic I've seen.

close up turn off,"If you are totally infatuated, OTT and obsessed with Jodie Foster, then this is definately the film for you.  If you are just a fan, or you just like her, or are actually rather indifferent to her, it isn't.Most of this long, long film are taken up with close-up shots of her face. Yes, there are other characters, Tom Skerritt, etc, but they are there only to give the appearance, the impression, that this is a bona fide movie, and not a video eulogy to her.  The story is the usual implausible aliens cliche, complete with the inevitable clips of Hitler ranting which apparently always obsesses aliens so.  Special effects are good, though limited. At one point I was fascinated by a colourful nebula; that lasted 2.4 seconds, then it was back to close-ups of Jodie.And, during some of those long, silent close-ups, it occurred to me that Jodie Foster is not exactly the most beautiful face ever seen on celluloid, in fact far from it.  Still, if we had to stare at Kournikova for two hours solid, no doubt her charms might start to wane too.This is a film for which you will never see a 'Director's Cut'.   Clearly the director was given carte blanche to indulge his mania for Foster's face, and the idea of cutting any of that out was anathema to him.See this film and every contour, every crease of Jodie Foster's face will be etched in your mind forever",,Anonymous,Mystery
Most intelligent alien film ever made,"There are so many ridiculous alien films around. Aliens, capable of traversing the unimaginable depths of space, something that we are centuries, at least, of doing ourselves.
The level of intelligence this takes is therefore beyond anything we know on planet Earth.
Therefore if like most alien films would have you believe they are solely intent on our death, it would be like us killing ants. They would wipe us out with ease. However it seems incredibly unlikely that as a species that could posses such interlect, they would still be as ignorant and moronic as they people on this planet. That war and all forms of violence would simply be beyond them.
Contact is a infinitely more likely scenario. It's a beautiful story, well acted and so cleverly written. The best film about aliens ever made",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

An SF movie without martians,"""Contact"" starts with a beautiful scene in which the camera zooms out of the earth and while the camera is zooming out we hear sound fragments from further and further back in time. For light there is a relation between distance and time (lightyears away). I don't know if there is also something like ""soundyears"" (I guess not), but the opening is imaginative all the same.Signals like sound are not only playing a major part in the opening scene, but also during the rest of the film. The film is about signals that seem to originate from an advanced civilisation. A passionate scientist (Josie Foster) tries to come into contact with this civilisation.In this way ""Contact"" is an SF movie in which the foreign civilisation tries to communicate by way of signals and not by travelling in person. So no Martians here. This benefits the reality (in SF of course to be interpreted in relative terms) of the movie and also keeps the special effects within limits. Compliments for a director who in other films does not economize on special effects (for example ""Back to the future"", 1985).A weak point in the film is the number of side plots (too much). There are sideplots with respect too:religion versus science;
competition between scientists;
the reaction of the population on the extra terrestrial signals;
an excentric millonaire.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
THE BEST MOVIE EVER,"Well at least for me.  This movie describes all the feelings I have ever had about religion.  It is a great movie all around minus the performances by Matthew Mac(well however you spell it).  That part of the movie could have been much better done with a better actor, but was still crucial to the movie.  In response to the once review that hated the movie cause they only saw one alien.  WELL, DUH!  I'm sorry, but what would make you think this was a movie about aliens.  ""A journey to the HEART of the universe."" - Where do you see space ships and aliens in that quote for the movie.  Plus if you can't get anything out of a movie this great you're doomed to what I call ""general public"" stupidity.  Back to the greatest movie ever.  Yeah, it is that. Well if you don't think so, that's okay - science and religion don't interest everyone.  But I think this movie has one thread that ties us all together.

A moderately diverting trip into space,"I thought I knew the 'twist' at the end of this movie before watching it. Turns out that was only a half-truth, and my foreknowledge didn't affect my enjoyment whatsoever. Oh well.Jodie Foster plays a young girl into science (once a rarity, now virtually the case in ever movie. Apparently, it's too sexist to portray them as liking dolls and dresses or something). Her doting dad dies one day, and she grows up desperate to prove his theory of life in space by making 'Contact' with extraterrestrial lifeforms. Title drop. Nniiccee.Matthew McConaughey is the bloke she has a one night stand with, but being a religious type is more than a bit skeptical of her beliefs. Think Mulder and Scully from The X Files, but reversed, and you've got some idea of their relationship. (also, I must say he looks and sounds much more like a stoned-out surfer dude than a priest, but what do I know?)The movie goes through the gears of introducing it's not-very-complex characters (including archive footage of Bill Clinton, who apparently wasn't asked first) and it remains amiably entertaining throughout, with a few high points and some dull spots. The two-and-a-half hour length doesn't feel justified, but it's hard to ponder on what could've been cut out. Who'd be an editor?!Basically, contrary to what some overzealous critics have said, Contact isn't anything too complicated at all, considering it's weighty subject... unless you count the Star Trek-esque technobabble that springs up now and then. It's just a nice way to waste half an afternoon... before forgetting virtually everything about a week later.I only saw it today, but trust me...

Very disappointing.,"This movie took up a very relevant theme, religion vs. science. Yet I felt it was biased towards science from the outset.  For example if you look at who you have representing religion: an ex-holy man (who quit being a priest because he could not manage the chastity vow? Of course not all Christian religions require their priests to take a chastity vow.), and a religious fanatic. Also, the alien's own words support her viewpoint. So while this movie takes on a very serious and challenging topic, it does not seem to want to, or be able to, dealing with it with the amount of thought and insight that is required. Also,as a side note I found the portrayal of the presidential security advisor to be very one-dimensional and irritating. Ultimately a disappointing movie.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Would have worked more as a TV series since it had a lot to tell even with the bloated runtime,"An interesting but uneven psychological science fiction that deals with different perspectives on existence of life outside Earth as well as what will be the reaction if a contact actually happens. Only problem is that it takes itself too seriously and tries too long to present a justification for everything that happens in the movie.Eleanor (Jodie Foster) has been fascinated about long distance communication and life outside earth from a very young age partly influenced by her father (David Morse). She focuses her studies and career towards this and chances on a communication from an unknown source. This communication after a lot of research is understood to be a design for building a spaceship to reach them.Jodie Foster as usual gives her best, but what sets the tone in the movie is Jena Malone's innocent passion which makes us understand what the older Eleanor does what she does. The intermittent politics, romance, science fiction - all take up a lot of runtime leaving too many things to conclude hastily. It could have worked a lot better as a mini-series like Taken or Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. I have admired a lot of Robert Zemeckis films where most of them has a naughty child-like passion and an intelligent main plot to them. Climax draws comparisons with the superior 2001: A Space Odyssey but still Contact does enough to hold its ground.Would have worked more as a TV series since it had a lot to tell even with the bloated runtime",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Excellent brainy sci-fi,"Directed by Robert Zemeckis and based on Carl Sagan's novel, Contact was a 1997 science-fiction film about a scientist (played by Jodie Foster) who makes a groundbreaking discovery when listening to radio frequencies coming from space as the world finally takes notice of her lifelong research.The film was well received by critics and audiences alike back in the late 90's and, today, it's easy to see how it influenced the likes of Interstellar (which also starred Matthew McConaughey) and Arrival, among others.Unlike your typical sci-fi blockbuster about extraterrestrial life, Contact took inspiration from Close Encounters Of The Third Kind and focused predominantly on the Earth-set prelude to the central discovery and its aftermath, never straying too far from the emotional and intellectual conflicts the main characters face. Along with a third act sequence that's definitely out-there, Contact aims to tell a very human story about science's relationship with faith so, while it boasts some terrific cinematography, it's hardly a spectacle until the ending and this sober approach might alienate (no pun intended) those viewers expecting something in the vein of, say, Independence Day.We follow Dr. Ellie Arroway's (Foster) story from childhood, when her relationship with her father was tragically cut short, to her career-driven adult life, all the way to the ends of the galaxy and back. Foster gives a pitch-perfect, layered performance as Ellie and the supporting cast, which includes James Woods and John Hurt, along with McConaughey's Christian philosopher/love interest, is excellent also.The way in which the message received from space is gradually decoded and is interpreted by various characters throughout is fascinating, especially seeing as the first image they uncover is controversial. Ellie faces countless obstacles on the way towards her goal, even afterwards, and, by the end of the film, there's something comforting about seeing how much that character has grown. In terms of the science/faith debate, the film seems to promote a balance between the two rather than pick a clear side and that was probably a wise move, though it won't please everyone.Contact may not be an action film but what it lacks in big, exciting set-pieces, it makes up for in great writing, storytelling and performances. This is sci-fi more along the lines of 2001: A Space Odyssey and it has a certain amount of depth, though it thankfully never feels too pretentious for its own good.A must for any fan of sci-fi.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Nope. Sorry Jodie.,"Jodie tries her heart out, and obviously has acting ability, but I didn't buy her as an astrophysicist or whatever she is supposed to be, much less a badly cast Matthew McConaughey as a man of faith with awful hair.These mismatched stars are hearing alien signals from a distant planet that require decoding by NASA, The White House and everyone with a Maths degree. I won't give away what unfolds, but there are moments of genuine wonder, suspense and excitement.Unfortunately, the 90s hokiness doesn't fly in 2024. The underlying messages about faith were too heavy handed and the performances too distracting. Zemeckis rolls out some familiar Gump beats with some amusing historical insertions, and Woods is again perfect as the scumbag.

Zemeckis's Very Best,"Carl Sagan, a sensible man of science. That's what one might think of him after seeing his exceptional novel coming to life in Contact. Robert Zemeckis's love letter to mankind's search for extraterrestrial life is one of his best among many other greats and a very few menials. Sagan beautifully crafted story about the search for answers might not be a very thrilling film, but it is for sure the one you will rejoice.A young girl (Ellie) who show a great deal of interest in the fields of science and mathematics grows without the care of her parents, both of whom have died when she was very young. Ellie grows up to be what she had initially intended to be, a scientist dedicated to searching for extraterrestrial life. In this far-flung pursuit, she comes across many hurdles, but she never gives up on her dream and that finally pays off as she finds the signal she had been searching for. This signal after many days of work proves to be a way to Contact Extraterrestrials but like at any other time as Science rises Religion tries to bring it back to the ground to its wretched state. Despite these frail deeds, humanity makes Contact by sending Ellie to represent all of humanity, but of this Contact she does not have any proof and a race which never asked for the proof for God asks for proof of this historic journey into the cosmos. While Ellie happens to be the only person to witness this truly legendary moment in the history mankind, mankind itself starts to despise her, but she never tries to give away to their stubborn foolishness for she believes that she had had Contact set aside what the world is saying about it or her.A Dedication to Carl Sagan, Robert Zemeckis's Contact is a film which celebrates two of highly controversial emotions, Human Persistence, and Belief, he tries and succeeds at blending both of these emotions with high precision, allowing none of both to overpower each other. The Background score was not very enchanting but was suitable for the situations it was played in. The simplistic and yet beautiful cinematography of the film is like the one you can see in other Robert's greats. Matthew McConaughey performance among the many great ones was the one you will love most. The Science Fiction part of the film which Robert Zemeckis was crowned king for his Back to the Future trilogy looks more like possible science than impossible fiction which most movies try to sell.You should and will watch Contact if you for one love science as much as I do. The film did not capture the recluse Ellie, but it did justify her Curiosity and persistence depicted in the Novel. It captures very truly the perks and struggles one might encounter on his way to chase the unchangeable.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Entertaining,"I don't usually go much for films that get into religious/philosophical concepts, but this one was fascinating nevertheless. The idea that another civilization might contact ours as a result of our telecommunications is wonderful.There were also some nice touches in the film. My favorite is a charming allusion to the star Vega, which features so prominently. When everyone's communing in the desert, among them are the Vega Car Club of Southern California. Perfect, especially since the Vega is such a forgotten vehicle these days, with very few left running. Not that it was a very good car, but I suppose it was a decent small car, reasonably priced.

Books to Movies...bulls to bullion cubes,"As with ""The Postman,"" I read the book before I saw the movie...and wondered what happened to ""the rest of it."" Oh well, at least the movie makers captured some of the controversy and interactions in Carl Sagan's ""Faith vs. Science Dialogues."" Jodie Foster is perfect for the ""Dr. Ellie Arroway"" role, but you would know that only if you've read the book. Too bad one of the central themes in the book were swept away for Cinema: The sometimes interstellar distance between members of the same family. And a driving force for SETI contact, I might add, for the main character. (It doesn't make Movie sense, because Ellie's mother isn't alive and married to the cold genius that is her real father.) So, ""Ellie"" is unaccountably scared when the machine is started up? The last time one like it was powered up, it turned a launch gantry into tons of twisted scrap metal. Anyone would approach a similar vehicle with some trepidation, to put it mildly, especially as the countdown clicked down to zero. Too bad the Movie didn't even consider the ""repeating pi sequence"" of the Book that would pique an alien's attention. But then, I preferred ""Gordon Krantz"" to ""The Stranger"" and ""Who will be responsible now, for these foolish children?"" to the mano-a-mano battle with ""The General."" Better to have had ""George Powhatan"" show the example of Cincinnatus/George Washington. Still, it's a great achievement, a popular SF-like film that boosts SETI and dares ask, ""What if the Aliens aren't the least bit interested in us unless we have something to show them?"" ***/****",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Sometimes Cerebral, Sometimes Silly.  Ultimately, It's a Missed Opportunity","With all the fun popcorn sci-fi movies we get each year, I think people forget how interesting and cerebral science-fiction can be. Contact is an ambitious look at the lengths of our universe and our human reach, but it sometimes gets a little too obsessed with itself to make a great watch.Directed by the great Robert Zemeckis and stars Oscar winning Jodie Foster as Dr. Arroway, a scientist who first discovers a potential connection to a life form from an unidentifiable place. Contact is mostly a film about a young girl devoting her life to the research and passion of her late father, but it deals with some heavy themes and ideas. Some ideas are perhaps way to grand scale and broad for the film's grasp, but at its core I really dug the bond between a father and his daughter here. David Morse plays her father in a limited role, but his presence is felt throughout the film.Jodie Foster's performance as Dr. Arroway is also a highlight. As much as it appears this is an ensemble piece with established actors, this film is largely on her shoulders, and she always kept me engaged. Unfortunately, her character is given a love interest in Matthew McConaughey's character, Palmer Joss. It's one thing to have a one- note character as a love interest. But it's even worse to have that very character ONLY be used when the plot feels like it needs the audience to be more invested in an ""emotional moment"". The Joss character is merely a plot device and is a hindrance on the enjoyment of Contact as a whole.But Joss wasn't the only highly flawed character. As Arroway gets closer to analyzing the 'aliens' message to the humans, a character named S.R. Hadden secretly meets with Arroway. This scene, along with every scene he appears in, is completely tonally out of place. This is Contact's biggest issue. The film's first half is tonally balanced and grounded in realism (at least for sci-fi), but once Hadden enters the picture it feels much more heightened than it does grounded. His character seems like a villain straight out of a Bond film, and that just didn't fit in with the rest of the story.I like what this film challenges us to think about and explore. And to its credit, the third act's payoff is truly unlike anything I have seen before, so there's no shortage of originality there.

One of the very best science fiction movies of the 90's,"When I first saw Contact, I breathed a breath and thought that finally did they make a very interresting sci-fi movie with real people and with a story that makes so much more sense than all those other stupid sci-fi movies out there nowadays, like Independance Day.An alien civilization contacts earth and instructs us how to build an interstellar transport device, so that we can come to them. It is a very original idea. We meet Ellie (Jodie Foster) who dreams of reaching the stars all her life, motivated by the loss of her mother and later her father. We see how her obsession almost destroys her when all her wishes and dreams become real. There is life out there.Then the film take a dramatic turn and all the world is presented. We see the American government trying to make it a matter that is better to be classified for national security (I almost laughed when I heard that). There are the religious fanatics that say that Jesus has returned and other religious fanatics saying that the Devil is tempting us with this. There is even a group of new nazis that's screaming that Hitler is alive, because of the signal containing the plans to the transport device was transmitted with the television transmission from the 1936 olympic games when was Hitler making his speech.The movie so expertly realizes the social hysteria created by contact other than us. Both from the scientists, who say that we should examine the unknown, and other people, who say that we should leave the unknown alone.And finally there is the ultra rich person (John Hurt) who can have transmitted and made all this happen just for his personal amusement.There is so much going on in this movie. The special effect are so subtly inserted into it that we hardly notice them until at the end. I especially love the effect when young Ellie runs for the medicine cabinet after her father has collapsed. We hardly notice it, because it so subtle and we are so involved in the story and the character. That is what special effects is supposed to do, in my opinion. Not have a bunch of stuff that are obviously effects and have a thin story around it. The effects are supposed to help and assist the story and character, not the other way around.When the movie ended I was left thinking of how magnificent this movie was. It had almost the same effect as 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' and 'Metropolis' (although very different films).",,Anonymous,Mystery

Fascinating and True....,"This movie still interests me every time I watch it. No, it is most certainly not a great or perfect film, and definitely not the best of the decade, as some have claimed. It is, however, a fascinating show of what would happen on Earth if Alien Contact were ever achieved. Everyone would freak.This is the story of a young scientist named Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster) who has lived her entire life believing that there must be something else out there sharing the universe with us. Otherwise, it seems like an awful waste of space. After fighting a losing battle for years to keep her program alive, she finally discovers an alien message by complete chance. After further study, they then discover that it is the blue-prints for a machine to be used to send someone to (presumably) meet them. With that news spread to the world, so begins the chaos of human reaction as the world must decide how to act on this data.The story is brilliant, one of the best things about the movie. We have all wondered at one time or another in our lives if there were other beings trying to contact us from outer space. Could there be intelligent life-forms out there? If so, what do they want- are they hostile or benign? This is the question that is posed for America in this film, and the country reacts exactly as I imagine it would in real life: Skepticism, over-reaction, and fanaticism all inter-mingling with each other. The portrayal of how the human race reacts is so true, that it feels frighteningly real.The cast works very well at their individual roles. Jodie Foster shows her real acting chops once again as the dreamer-of-a-scientist who really is searching for just one thing: Meaning in her life. The supporting cast does just what they're supposed to: support. Matthew McConaughy plays the role of the man who is stuck between two worlds just fine, and James Woods, Tom Skerritt, David Morse, and Angela Bassett all turn in nice work. The real stand-out of the supporters is William Fichtner as Ellie's blind mentor. He does very well.It's a fine movie, one of the better science-fiction dramas for sure.

Best thing to say is to watch this movie with an open mind, and draw your own answers. If you watch this movie with preconceived notions of what is truth, you won't enjoy it, because you'll feel betrayed. This movie takes you along a certain conclusion and just when you feel the glow of affirmation, it yanks the rug out from under your feet, and says: ""Guess again!""But it does give one answer, one which we all know all along, yet each one of us fears the most: that the answers are within ourselves.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It could have been a legend,"The idea of the movie is great! Actually a very unglamorous look at how you might imagine, the first contact with aliens: a sober and factual presentation of scientific analysis and mathematical subtleties, but the movie is not boring, not only by cross-shooting human shortcomings, but even by the more and more constructive splendor and majesty of the event. He remains at any moment convincingly realistic, almost documentary. But then the film loses in the end in such a spiritual nonsense, it's like crying! He could have been a legend, really a yearning desire, as it might happen in reality, really, but it is a slap in the face of the audience, I think. As well as saving the confession is no longer of the two clerks in the last scene of the movie. Just like crying!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Excellent portrayal of the war between science and religion,"To those not versed in the science/religion conflict they can easily think this is just a science fiction movie.  Nothing can be further from the truth.  In fact, ""TRUTH"" is what this movie is all about.  The search for ""TRUTH"" -- science's way or religion's way.  The theme of this movie was the vehicle to drive home this long lasting debate.This was Carl Sagan's last stab at the hypocrisy in religion, and religion's anti-science stance.  On the one hand religion wants us to believe in a god without proof, but those very same people demanded evidence of Arroway's trip.  Typical.Everywhere in the movie we see the conflict between religion and science. Once Dr. Arroway finds the evidence, what do the ""believers"" want to do? Militarize it!  Again, a typical approach from the religious side.  If they do not understand it, or it differs from their world view, destroy it! Science just wants to understand it.Another example is who do they send to visit these aliens?  The ""true believer"" to spread the Word!  How many times has human history seen the results of these trips!   One would expect these far more advanced aliens would have dispensed with such believe systems.  You cannot advance to that stage still clinging to antiquated, and superstitious, views of reality.I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and saw it at the theatre 3 times, and have watched the video many times more.  I always catch another snippet of conflict.Thank you Carl Sagan!!  We miss you.Richard Wakefield Toronto, Ontario, Canada",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

OMG!  Actual SCIENCE fiction,"The best first-contact film since Close Encounters.  I personally think it exceeds that film, mostly due to the realism of the premise:  Should first contact happen, it is far more likely to be via radio-signal than via an actual visit.  Which is more economical?  Sending ships out to hundreds of thousands of stars, or beaming a program saying ""come see us, here's how"" at those stars?Jodie gives a typically wonderful performance here.  Since the film rests on her, that's enough.  Matthew does turn in an adequate performance as her love interest/moral foil, and whoever it is who plays the blind scientist does an incredible job.As to effects?  Beyond anything you'd expect.  The intro has become my sound-system demo, for instance.  There are so many subtle effects shots in this film, you need a program to count 'em all.  One of my personal favorites is the ""camera through the door"" scene.  Check the DVD extras to see what I mean.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
2001 for 90s!?!?!? Blasphemer!,"Contact is Hollywood cheese.  The only good part was the very beginning shot starting above the Earth...brilliant. From there, this over-rated, predictable, and insulting movie went downhill.I couldn't stand Jodi Foster's character, as if the only justification for not believing in God must be some traumatic childhood event. Mac-what's his name was pompous and boring, his role as a spiritual advisor was wholly unbelievable.  If this guy is supposed to be a 'thoughtful' religious person, that doesn't say much for the movie's view of Christianity! His 'deep philosophical insights' were hilarious!The movie used the same, worn-out 'reality' techniques of showing 'real' CNN newscasts, morphing president Clinton, Larry King, etc...like Armageddon and ID4.  The purpose, I assume, is to generate this pulling-us-together, patriotic momentum.  I just ended up getting tired of it...it was fluff that wasted vast portions of the movie.The borrowing from the great '2001' was blatant.  But where 2001 is a powerful, unique vision and a great movie, Contact attempted to Hollywoodize a compelling concept--Forrest Gump meets 2001, stock characters and formulaic relationships.  People who liked this movie got caught by the same ol'bag of tricks.  Contact was no deeper than Armageddon or ID4, despite its trying to tackle a serious issue.

Is there life out there somewhere?,"Bear with me.A young girl is encouraged by her widower father to explore the world and beyond; soon left orphaned, she turns inward and relentlessly pursues the signs for intelligent life in the universe, only to be thwarted at every turn by an evil nemesis and yet be assisted by a mysterious shadowy figure with the power to make his machinations stick.  Add to this a love story between our driven scientist and a fallen yet equally driven spiritualist and you have all the making of a mass of hokum that in lesser hands would go downhill faster than a Radio Flyer on Mount Everest.However, we are in the hands of Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Back To The Future) who masterfully weaves the framework drafted by Carl Sagan into a marvelous tapestry.Jodie Foster is Ellie Arroway, the driven scientist who needs empirical evidence for anything to exist in her world.  She's part of a SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) group about to have their funding pulled by Dr. David Drumland (Tom Skeritt), who at the film's open is the director of the National Science Foundation.  Arroway's childhood traumas and fascinations have fused to turn her into this driven force; she is a woman with a vision and she is not easily deterred.  Ellie briefly becomes involved with Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey), a man who nearly became a priest, but who admits that celebacy was a problem for him, which makes him no less devout as a messenger for God's word.What evolves is a story that explores the relationship between society, science, and religion.  Its characters, which could easily fall cartoonish in the wrong hands, are well-drawn and expertly directed by Zemeckis, who had some prior experience with 'toons and apparently was aware what to watch out for.Lest you think my opening was a criticism of Carl Sagan and Ann Dryan's screen story, it was not.  Sagan and Dryan provided a good story structure for screenwriters James Hart and Michael Goldenberg to build on.  Zemeckis, aided by Alan Silvestri's music, keeps it all in tune and doesn't provide us with pat answers, and yet keeps us interested.One of the more endearing qualities of this film is its true-to-life representation of what would happen in America should what happens to Ellie happens to us.  From beginning to end, every part of her experience rang true.So, for a thoughtful way to spend 2½ hours, rent or purchase this film. You'll enjoy it.My Vote: 8",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Embrace ideas, not belief structures.","""Contact"" is one of my all time favourite films. I am intrigued by its balanced presentation on technology and spirituality. I am thankful for its liberating ideas and concepts, on what makes the species of man so rare and precious.It speaks to people like me in particular, who believe in the presence of a higher being, but not necessarily one with a Christian/ Catholic persuasion.To me, Faith should be universal. It should be built freely around ideas and ideals, not belief structures. More often than not, the hierarchical bureaucracy of organised religion cripples our judgement. Scaring us into obedience and dictating our actions does not enlighten our search for truth and the nature of being. It only serves to restrict our freedom. Freedom to explore and freedom to evolve. Freedom, to be human.""Contact"" is thus a special and timely film. Equally thought provoking and heartfelt, it is required viewing for people struggling, with their faith, with their lives and the very meaning of their existence.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A brilliant treatment of the hypocrisy of religion and establishment.,"Contact is avowed atheist Carl Sagan's glorious swan song, a brilliant treatment of the hypocrisy of religion and establishment. Jodie Foster is characteristically excellent as Dr. Ellie Arroway, the gifted astronomer whose discovery of an alien beacon sets off a frenzy for control of how the discovery should be handled.Dr. Arroway is slapped down at every turn by those who do not appreciate her independent thinking. Her dilemma reflects the logical fallacy at the heart of all religion. When she will not accept on faith the ""truths"" imposed on her by religious zealots, she is denied the chance to be a part of a mission based on her research. Later, she is ridiculed for asking others to accept what she has seen with her own eyes.Purists among us will quibble over some of the film's science, particularly in an early scene where Dr. Arroway, a brilliant mathemetician, miscalculates the odds of finding advanced civilizations in the universe by orders of magnitude. But the film has many worthy diversions. Matthew McConaughey, as Palmer Joss, is supposedly the good guy among the religious right. He is cunning and calculating, and like most religious fanatics, he is willing to do anything to get his way, especially if it includes a chance to punish nonbelievers. But Rob Lowe is priceless as Richard Rank, a thinly veiled version of Ralph Reed, a bigoted, hateful power monger who wields his flock as a sword to further his political interests.Tom Skerritt's Dr. Drumlin lacks dimension, but is right on as the Machievellian politician exploiting Arroway's discovery. The supporting cast is sterling, including Angela Bassett, Jake Busey and David Morse, as Dr. Arroway's father. But the gem of the supporting cast is John Hurt. He is utterly magnificent as the ominous S. R. Hadden, the Howard Hughes-like scientist who lives on an airplane and funds the research that leads to the discovery of the alien signal.Trivia note: one of Dr. Arroway's colleagues is Dr. Kent Clark, and I can't help but wonder what Sagan implies by that, aside from the obvious.Far better than the typical Sci-Fi fare, Contact is a thoughtful and challenging look into the relationship between science and religion. It isn't hard, from watching the movie, to determine which side of the conflict Sagan came down on.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Its very Hollywood but raises some interesting questions nonetheless,"""Contact"" tackles a subject hard to make entertaining whilst retaining much intellectual credibility. I think anyone will admit, for this film to work you may have to temporarily place your cynicism aside and just go along for the ride. The central theme in this film is not to explore the scientific possibilities of time or space travel, but question of faith.The plot and acting itself is quite strong across the board. (Ellie) Jodie Foster gives a passionate performance, as the minority scientists with an unrelenting dream of making contact with another intelligence. McConaughey gives an adequate support role, as the contrasting personality to Foster, someone who believes in faith and in God. James Woods plays the typically cynical military officer. Finally, upon Ellie and her team receiving a convoluted message from intergalactic entity, a media frenzy ensues and ultimately the question of other life in the universe and other ethical consequences are explored. There is numerous cameo appearances from Hollywood celebrities which add to the authenticity of the film. As such this film does veer off and become cheesy and unrealistic at times, but I don't think the film could have worked if it hadn't.The film provides more questions than answers, and rightly so. Ultimately, whether you believe in God or science, ""Contact"" proposes that faith is required to believe in both. As science's criticism of religion has been the lack of empirical evidence, it is posed that empirical or tangible evidence is not the currency that makes something true. Science requires the belief in something which cannot be proved, just as religion does. What I took from this film is that we should tolerate each-other's beliefs, no matter how far-fetched they may be from our own perspective.Iroically, the film seems to set out proving the importance of making contact with an ET, but we learn that is more important to make contact with each-other.Worthwhile.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
For Carl,"This movie came to me at exactly the right time in my life.  Actually, I think that it just may have come to all of us at exactly the right time. On the cusp of the millennium, there has been a (documented) resurgence in things spiritual, and this movie (based on Dr. Sagan's life-long commitment to reconciling the spiritual and the scientific), has something quite important to say.  Don't invite the neighbors and their kids over to watch this one as a rental.  Buy the DVD (and the DVD player, if it comes to that) and watch it (multiple times!) in the wee hours by yourself.

"Good, but nothing special","After you see Contact, you will realize that Contact was more of a movie that simply got over-hyped. The movie has a good opening half, up to the part where they actually get the signal from elsewhere. I thought that the day after they got the signal was rather amusing, especially where they were driving through the chaos outside and the movie is playing the song ""It looks like a purple people eater to me"" was quite amusing.But the part where they start attempting to actually understand what they had just received was simply a bad joke. I almost laugh at the way their received images, having the alien's designs coming together in a cube shape, would something even use a design like this? Imagine how long it could seriously take to understand what came in a signal that includes image formats and whatever else.Then when they quickly get the stuff built, it gets blown-up by some terrorist guy. I can understand someone wanting to blow-up something from the aliens, but then there's a second built version which is unknown to the public and actually only gets to work for the privately built second try. The immediate success in their sudden second location was rather bazaar and lame. Especially when they finally believe the story of her talk with the aliens after nothing but finding extra length in the recordings. Couldn't this have simply been because the equipment wasn't turned off immediately?I honestly liked the opening half of another SETI-based movie, ""The Arrival"", much more than Contact.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of my favorites of the 1990's,"I will go a step further and say this is one of my favorite movies ever. I found it though-provoking, awe-inspiring, deep, thoughtful, analytical, and powerful. Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster) is a young, gifted scientist who is eager in finding the proof of extra-terrestrial life. This has been her ambition since the death of her father. She cannot fathom a universe so big without any other life, considering it a ""waste of space."" Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey) is a religious leader who crosses paths with her. Ironically, while he believes in God, Ellie is an atheist and demands proof of the existence of everything. At odds with Ellie is Dr. David Drumlin (Tom Skerrit) who keeps pulling the funding from Ellie's crusade. He eventually becomes the White House Adviser on Science. Suddenly, Ellie finds the proof she has been looking for. A definite signal comes from the star, Vega, which is roughly 26 light-years from Earth. They apparently intercepted a signal, then sent it back with their own schematics for a device that will likely transport someone somewhere. The White House takes over this project, and several nations join to build the massive device. Of course, Ellie wants to go, but vying for the honor are several others and she must compete. Then, the politics begin. The politics behind building and technology rights, who will go, and who will implement public policy. Some people expect hostile aliens, others consider them friends, and many people see it as the ultimate religious experience. I like this movie for so many reasons. At the outset is the politicking that goes on. It mirrors what the real world would be like if such a thing would happen. This leads to the wonderful acting that goes along with it. We all know the over-zealous pragmatist Mr. Kitz (James Wood), the level-headed White House Chief of Staff (Angela Bassett), the conservative religious leader Richard Rank (Rob Lowe), and the wise and insightful Kent (William Ficthner). We know a grand-stander and opportunist like Drumlin (Skerritt). What pushes this movie over the top, though, is the direction of Robert Zemickis. This is undoubtedly his best movie to date, even outshining his previous effort, Forest Gump. He adapts Carl Sagan's novel into a tour-de-force that not only lets us see how our society would truly react to such a thing, but also the dire consequences. He casts enough story, doubt, and confusion to make us wonder what really happened ... until the end. It also delivers a subtle, powerful message without being preachy or over-the-top. I left the movie theater awe-struck in a deep, profound way. I was scared, nervous, and moved. I have contended Contact was sorely over-looked in the Academy Awards because of the entertaining but over-hyped Titanic. It should have been nominated for best picture. Too bad. It was truly majestic ... and my favorite picture of 1997.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The climax was written lazily and not very imaginatively and the ending makes it completely pointless. No one wants to see this type of ending particularly after they have paid to see it in theaters. (Why even bother to make a movie if you are going to do it that way?) The climax should have involved only what it hinted at and the ending should have been the exciting alternative.

Great Film Adaptation of a Great Book!,"""Contact"" was based on the book by Carl Sagan, one of the greatest scientific minds of our times. The film, while not exactly like the book due to time constraints, is a spectacular adaptation that stands beautifully on its own.While the movie is about ""finding little green men"", it is also about finding trust and faith in others and in a power beyond one's self. There is plenty of political power-grabbing brinkmanship along with benevolent souls who come through when they see someone who is really just trying their best.I watched this movie for the first time since it came out which is now almost 25 years ago. What particularly strikes me is that the special effects still stand up and are as good as anything we might expect to see today. There was never a moment where I thought, ""Gee, that looks dated."" And all the special effects were used solely to support and advance the story. Never did I feel like there were computer nerds just creating crazy effects simply because they could. It is all very well and tastefully done.The cast is great. The acting is great. The story is great. The effects are great. Everything is great.The only reason I give it 9 stars instead of 10 is because the pacing gets a little slow at times making the movie feel a bit long. And that is really strictly a personal perception. That and Jodi Foster tends to over-act somewhat, especially given that she is supposed to be a cool-headed, rational scientist.After nearly a quarter of a century, ""Contact"" is still connecting!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Come on! lt's like you're saying that science killed God. What if science simply revealed that He never existed in the first place?,"We a just a small insignificant planet, in an ordinary solar system, in an ordinary galaxy, in an average part of the universe. Carl Sagan's novel reminds us of that fact and that we are insignificant without each other. Unfortunately, I would guess that 95% of the people watch this film would not grasp that and would continue to believe in what has been programmed into them from birth.It would be so easy to focus on the religious nut cases like Richard Rank (Rob Lowe) and Joseph (Jake Busey); or the opportunists like Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey) and Michael Kitz (James Woods); or the typical bureaucratic jerks that horn in on others work like David Drumlin (Tom Skerritt). However, they were just players on a stage where larger things were being explored.I consider this to be Jodie Foster's finest work; even better than the performances that won her her two Oscars. She is a commanding presence on the screen, and she dominated this film despite the efforts of others to push her aside.The incredible special effects and cinematography made this most enjoyable. I never tire of looking at Hubble photos, and admiring the majesty and beauty that exists in space. I never tire of this film and the promise of what could be.Thank you, Carl.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Profoundly affecting,"Zemeckis' finest film has everything a mainstream move should have: brains, beauty, and a little bit of stardust.The transcendentally brilliant Jodie Foster puts in a great performance as Ellie Arroway, a wide-eyed little girl in a woman's body. In Foster's Ellie, we see all the failed college relationships described in Carl Sagan's novel.After the death of her father (David Morse), Ellie becomes a star-gazer, convinced there can be no God. It's a simple, convincing, and rather moving set up, always propelling the story, even when the big themes rear their head. In, say, Spielberg's hands, this emotional core might have become cloying. But director Robert Zemeckis and screenwriters James V Hart and Michael Goldenberg tell the story almost entirely from the point of view of a heroine who is essentially an innocent in a world of cynical agendas. So when Ellie takes her voyage, those downplayed final scenes feel true, not mawkish.There are subtleties here which enrich the experience. Ellie is eventually blessed with her opportunity by the benign, paternal Hadden (John Hurt), who - unlike her own father - is able to cheat death. Also, why does Ellie not share Palmer's (Matthew McConaughey) fear of death? She purports to hold no fear of God; and yet, deep down, doesn't she truly wish to join her father, wherever he might be... in Heaven, perhaps?

Jodie Foster's acting makes this a classic.,"This is an excellent movie, mainly due to the excellent acting of Jodie Foster and John Hurt and some great scenes. While this is Jodie's movie, John Hurt as Hadden is excellent. The story is actually rather simple, but filled with great ideas, as you would expect from Sagan. The only element which drags is the Matthew McConaughey character. I am uncertain why, but it did not work. Apart from that this movie is a classic which you will find yourself re-watching, if for no other reason than to hear John Hurt say from space, do you want a ride.

I'll ask the questions here and leave you to come up with your own answers.1. Would Ellie have been so interested in scientific things if she hadn't been brought up by her father without a mother's influence?2. If Ellie's father had not died while she was still young, would she have been less anti-God?3. Who looked after Ellie after her father died?

Science and religion in wedded bliss,"If you can imagine ""Armageddon"" without the action you'd have a pretty good idea of ""Contact."" Perhaps this is because they both hail from the late 90s (""Contact"" came out the summer of '97 and ""Armageddon"" a year later). Toss in some elements of ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"" and -- voilà -- you have ""Contact."" Not that it doesn't possess its own uniqueness, of course.The story has to do with an astronomer (Jodie Foster) finding conclusive radio evidence of extraterrestrial life. The intelligence -- whatever it is -- then sends data on how to meet, but only one person can go.Foster's character is an atheistic scientist while her romantic interest in the story believes in God (Matthew McConaughey). The respectful tension of these two mindsets in the face of extraterrestrial contact is interesting and the filmmakers do a good job of maintaining a balance between the two, rather than advocating one above the other. Generally speaking, science and religion both pursue truth (the way it really is) but their methods differ, science stresses empirical evidence whereas religion looks to faith and love. Why can't we embrace both? (What a revolutionary idea!)Both vantage points are portrayed by people who are genuine and honest about their pursuit of truth. Between them is the character of David Drumlin (played excellently by Tom Skerritt) who is driven by selfish ambition and therefore willing to put on airs to attain his goals. But corruption comes at a price.The film is based on Carl Sagan's book of the same name. The balance in the film between fact and faith, atheism and belief can be attributed to Sagan's spiritual agnosticism. He rejected the arrogance of atheism and has stated: ""Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality. When we recognize our place in an immensity of light-years and in the passage of ages, when we grasp the intricacy, beauty, and subtlety of life, then that soaring feeling, that sense of elation and humility combined, is surely spiritual."" Although I'm not a disciple of Sagan I appreciate his humility, genius and honest reflections on the awesomeness and beauty of the universe and all it's mysteries.

some flaws,"Contact is a movie I have seen many times, and through it all, I have learned to sort of ignore all of the irritating, poorly cast male characters and focus on the big picture - the movie's positive message, the sophisticated plot and the often stunning visuals.

Contact may have been a book written by Carl Sagan, but the movie is all Jodie Foster. And as a vehicle for Jodie, it was well conceived. But Jodie's incredibly strong on screen persona is not easy for everyone to digest. And worst of all, it tends to rubs off on everyone else that is cast to play along side of her here.Anyway, Jodie is Dr Ellie Arroway, a brilliant, lonely, obsessed and tempestuous astrophysicist. Since the death of her Dad when she was a youngster, there has been a big wormhole sized hole in her world, and she attempts to fill it by searching for life on other planets. This very personal story is then weaved together with an intergalactic one involving not only all of humankind but otherworldly beings as well when she succeeds in making first contact with aliens from the Vega star system. They want to say hello and send down a taxi (which we must build ourselves) to ferry some lucky individual to the center of the galaxy for a rendezvous with......God? Anyway, only one person gets to go, which, although it makes no sense from a practical point of view, fits well with the movie's theme which is an exploration of one woman's very personal, spiritual journey. One very bright but socially inept young woman.OK, now perhaps because those that wrote the screenplay knew that Jodie's personality would not go down easily with everyone, they actually wrote jokes about her confrontational, ""pain in the ass"" style right into the script. That way you were at least told up front what to expect and it was OK - Dr Arroway is a seething mass of conflicting emotions, veiled and not so veiled hostilities, and childlike obsessions that often go beyond normal logic or reasoning. She doesn't always get along with others, particularly men, and particularly anyone that tries to control her. Instinctively, every male to her is either a loving father figure or someone just trying to jerk her around. Well, predictably, I guess, this is why all of the male's cast here are either jerks or Dads. Or sometimes both :) But does this make for enjoyable movie viewing? No, most of the time it doesn't. Not when you have actors like Tom Skerrit and James Woods cast in painfully confrontational roles and given incredibly lame scripts, playing jerks opposite Jodie. And neither does it work for me regarding Ellie's blind friend Kent, who I found irritating. But I reserve most of my scorn for Ellie's love interest, Palmer Joss (Played by Mathew McConaughey), who somehow manages to combine jerk/leering/frat boy with godlike/father/saintliness, and does it with a straight face. I mean, WTF? Who is kidding who? Well, Ellie seems to be attracted to both sides of this chameleon, though. I mean, it took lines like ""that must really chap his ass"" to get her attention initially, but down the line, she also bows down to ""you could call me a man of the cloth"", as if, by now balancing the ticket, she just might have found herself her perfect man? I don't know, but Palmer's White House ""Spiritual adviser"" connections are ludicrous. Couldn't they have cast someone less of a hunk for this role? Someone more cerebral? Jeff Bridges, perhaps?Anyway, I no longer laugh out loud at these sillier casting perplexities, and enjoy the movie for its originality plot-wise and for the science, the mystery and the journey into space. This is where Jodie is most at home anyway, not in the social arena. And ditto myself when viewing this movie. There is much to enjoy. A cool space transporter powered by strange technology that looks like a giant atom. A message from space that must be decoded. And without writing a spoiler here, I must say there are some unexpected plot twists along the way that will entertain. But ultimately, what it comes down to is Jodie and her relationship with all of these men, both the jerks and the dad's. Jodie frets and glares at the jerks. But in the presence of the Dad's she is soft, vulnerable, feminine and childlike in awe. I kind of find this to be a little disquieting, as though she never grew up, never accepted her place in the world amongst all of her peers. Maybe her journey, though and the fulfillment of her spiritual quest will settle her down. I think that knowing that might be a relief to us film goers, anyway. Knowing that Ellie Arroway, if she were ever to resurface in a sequel, would be a little mellower and forgiving towards those of us less Godlike than dear old Dad. And then maybe the jerks would disappear too...",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Wonderful Movie,"I have seen this movie a number of times and I watched it again last night on TV. I do not understand how anyone who could call this movie ""bad."" The story is not perfect but even with its faults, this is the type of movie which I can watch over and over. Carl Sagan is an amazing Science Fiction writer. And this movie is a lasting tribute. The performances are superb. Jodie Foster is believable as a driven female scientist who transitions from skeptic to true believer in life beyond what is know to us. Th story telling, cinematography and acting all make this film a classic. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who like science fiction,superb story telling and great acting.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Not bad but a bit confusing,"To make a movie about this subject is difficult and daring because there is too much at stake since it deals with complex scientific aspects that cannot be lightly treated and also moral and even religious aspects of great depth. Nevertheless director Zemeckis manages to surf through these obstacles avoiding the main barriers but not without leaving a few things partly unexplained. It's the story of a lady scientist and astronomer who is fascinated by the possibility of finding extraterrestrial contacts displaying the existence of (human?) life in other parts of the universe. She meets with enormous difficulties, antagonisms and resistances on that task of hers but also some support from other people and sources. The movie from a certain point on enters in a series of unpredicted events, full of agitation and emotion in which the performance of Jodie Foster as the main protagonist is excellent. In the last part there are some scenes full of visual and factual poetry and beauty. All this, however, with a certain lack of complete explanation of a few scientific and technical details treated too lightly like for instance the building of the mysterious machine according to plans sent from Vega. And the final ending though very poetic is a bit confusing.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Contact: Quality Sci-Fi Film,"I just viewed Contact for the second time. I had retracted my views on this film as a top 2000 film of all time because of an honest objection by one of my readers who disagreed with my assertion in the book. I took it out of the next edition; that was a mistake. I put it back in for the next several years' edition of 2000 of the Best Films of All Time. I was right the first time. It is a great film and does address several key questions: Is There a God? If There Isn't a God, then should we trust Science? Should we trust the Private Sector over our governments, God, and the Military-Industrial Complex? No one really knows the answers to these questions; we can only give our best guess; and that guess would be based on faith. Faith in science or faith in God? Maybe faith in both. There may not be much difference in any of these faiths. Everyone believes in something. I believe I'm going to have another gin and tonic.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A very exciting, thought provoking, and well executed film","It has been nearly a decade since this came out and it still echoes in my mind from time to time. I need not repeat what others have said in this forum... just to assert that this is one of the best films I have seen in the past 10 years.I am not a spiritual person, so I found the ending a little bit weak, so I vote a 9/10. Still, how better could one have ended it? I do not know.I found the build up to be very exciting and unique to a film that comes across as drama more than sci-fi. Yet it was all about the fact that science is just a subset of what can be known. No one has all the answers... not spiritualists or scientists.I think this film taught me just that, while getting me excited, disappointed, and then excited again. It recognizes some very deep thoughts that pass through many a human mind. At the same time, you can follow Ellie's adventure and be engaged, thrilled, disappointed, and enlightened.I need not mention the fine cast... so I won't (somebody else has certainly already done so). Needless to say, it was great.Not all will find this film as spectacular as I have found it to be. For them, I am sorry. This film opens the mind... it does not contradict your faith. It may seem to suggest that you examine your beliefs, but it also makes clear that you are free to believe what you believe.That is a brilliant balance.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Pretty good, but way over-rated","I didn't read the book, but if it was trying to say that a god exists because of the mathematical equation of a circle, I'd have to say the book was probably very stupid. However, I didn't get the impression that the movie was trying to prove to everyone that ""God"" exists. I got the impression that it was an equal minded, and very reserved look at the religious and ethical qualities of a contact situation. Too reserved, in my opinion. When I heard the movie had something to do with god, I definately hopeed it would be more controversal than it was. Certainly it started us thinking about religion, and sparked some conversations, but it wasn't a very big spark. They tackled a very important subject, but in my opinion, not nearly hard enough. As far as this movie being more intelligent than most sci-fi movies, that is ridiculous. Just because a movie has no action, happens to star Jodie Foster, or very carefully tries to bring up the issue of religion, doesn't mean that it was a work of genius. Even though I was pretty bored during some of it, I still think that it was a fairly good movie, but let's not get too carried away.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""If it's just us, it seems like an awful waste of space""","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)The contact frequency is pi times hydrogen, and the first transmission is the prime numbers 2, 3, 5, 7.... This is what WE would transmit and do transmit because such signals cannot be mistaken for natural phenomena. It's obvious that what we have here is intelligent science fiction. The general public may be surprised to learn-I know I was-that a significant segment of the scientific community considers the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) a pie in the sky waste of money and human energy. The prejudice is so great that until recently no self- respecting astrophysicist would dare specialize in it for fear of having no career. Well, there are a few brave souls. This is a movie about one of them.I didn't read the book-shame on me, but works of fiction by scientists usually make me blush in embarrassment for their authors. But Carl Sagan was no ordinary scientist, nor was he an ordinary writer. Still I suspect that what made this an excellent movie was the script by James V. Hart and Michael Goldenberg. It is extraordinarily well thought out and carefully crafted with deft turns of plot and a satisfying conclusion, with no need for spaghetti code patches near the end, the bane of most sci-fi and action/adventure flicks. It is also emotionally moving.There is, however, just the slightest ""written by committee"" feel to the movie. Everything is a little too neat and too well explained. It's a paradox of any art form that sometimes you can polish too much, you can overwrite and lose some spontaneity in the production. And yes, Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey) is a little too good to be true, and Arroway (Jodie Foster) really needs a serious fault or at least some kind of vice to round her out. Being a political innocent isn't enough. And the media and governmental reaction is a little too pat and cynical.However all of that is insignificant compared with the most difficult thing about writing a futuristic or ""superior civilization"" story, namely coming up some unknown technology or information to make it seem real. The formula for cold fusion would work, or the cure to cancer. But how can you do THAT?You can't (otherwise what you come up with would probably be more important than your script.) It is fascinating to see how Sagan, Hart, Goldenberg and Director Robert Zemeckis cleverly sidestep this pitfall. Only those who have tried it can know what a fine job was done here. And incidentally Zemeckis can be given credit for making ""Contact"" intelligible without any dumbing down, no mean feat in itself.As far as star Jodie Foster goes, it's clear she inhaled and imbibed the persona of the modern woman of science in preparation for this role, so well does she play the part of astrophysicist Ellie Arroway. They have her come out looking androgynous, which is appropriate for two reasons, one, she lost her mother early and had to identify with her father more than most (an explanation, if one were needed, for how she became a scientist); and two, those little green beings aren't going to be men or women, having given up our sort of primitive sexuality long ago. She is never glamorized; even when she dresses up, she still looks like a normal woman in a gown. And she is appropriately unpolitical and naive and far too honest in front of the camera, something the real Jodie Foster is not.Best line: ""It's so beautiful. They should have sent a poet.""",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The ultimate escapism,"This is an excellent film. I read the book after watching it and would recommend one do the reverse. The book, comparably, had a lot of filler and the movie pared the tale down beautifully. Still, the book was powerful in that very detail.Jodie Foster, while unlike the book's character, is wonderful. And thank the stars her love interest is Matthew McConaughey and not the circus-tattooed-lightening-struck fellow Sagan envisioned. All is forgiven for that fact alone. I personally would second guess a trip to the cosmos to spend my remaining years with Matt.The power of Sagan's idea- the consideration of life Elsewhere imposed on accepted Earth Science- is carried out in this movie. The details of plot don't matter, really. Sagan's point is well taken and faithfully conveyed.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A sad travesty of a great novel,"I don't know whether this signifies a fundamental cultural difference between the British and the Americans, but I hated this movie. It transformed an intelligent, sophisticated novel into a simplistic if not ridiculous film. Ellie's motivation to be an astronomer is trivialized into a Hollywood cliche (she wants to search for her lost father), instead of being rational and about the pursuit of knowledge. Her relationship with the preacher is ridiculously transformed into a love affair (good grief, the guy is a fundamentalist preacher, not a sex starved student). So instead of an intelligent mediation on religious versus scientific knowledge, we get cheap sentimentalism.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Do you believe in aliens? I do !,"**** out of ****The reason I like sci-fi movies better than fantasy movies (two of the genres which most tells fictional stories) is that the sci-fi movies gives us a vision of the future. It may be about how the world will look like a few years from now or what are we doing at the moment which will result in something even bigger in the future. Contact follows that pattern.Jodie Foster plays Eleanor Arroway, most of the time, called Ellie. Her character is simply amazing, she's a scientist who, since childhood developed interest in the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence and communications. To see her working is a delight. I find it really an art to study the outer space, listening to sounds in earphones and marking stars as already checked and negative as a result for alien search.While she meets Palmer Joss, played by Matthew McCounaughey, a theology student, writer and believer of God's existence itself, the movie show us a conflict between science and religion from the point of view of the two characters, since she believes only in science, while he believes in god, but also thinks science is important, although not at a point where you might give your life for it. This movie reminds me a lot of the Dan Brown novel, Angels & Demons. It's about a discovery made by Ellie, concerning life outside our planet. The story unfolds really amazing. Director Robert Zemeckis is one of my favorites. The ending though might surprise people in an unexpected way.I recommend it to any sci-fi freak.

astronomer searches for life on other planets(you might be surprised at the outcome),"this movie pleasantly surprised me.i had put off seeing it for years,mainly for 2 reasons.the first reason is that the movie looked like it would be 1 long bore.the 2nd reason is Jodie Foster.i have never been a fan of her.something about her just rubs me the wrong way.however,tonite the movie was on 1 of the movie channels,and i thought,what the heck.i'll give It a shot.i figured i'd watch for a short time,then become bored and do something else.that was not to be the case.yes,the movie is long,clocking in at almost exactly 2 and a half hours.but it doesn't feel like a 2 and a half hour movie.i thought the time went by rather quickly,and considering the subject matter,you wouldn't think that would be the case.the movie has a lot of dialogue and passive action,for the most part.a drama,more than anything.but the filmmakers made it interesting,and even compelling at times.the visual effects were very well done.the film has a beautiful look to it in many scenes.Jodie Foster did a good job in this movie,and i didn't find her annoying at all.i think she really brought some heart and soul,some passion to her character.i also liked the use of irony in a scene towards the end of the movie.it's nice to be pleasantly surprised once in awhile.for me ""Contact"" is an 8.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Awful, awful, awful...","I'm always shocked to read so many good reviews of Contact, particularly among people claiming to be SF fans.  This movie was one of the worst SF movies ever made.  It really should have had Peter Graves in it just for the theme.  It was Carl Sagen telling us that we are stupid and he is not.  I found myself wanting to yell at the screen during the movie many times when the entire planet's field of experts could not seem to figure out something that was so obvious to me.The ""religious"" elements of the story were just plain dumb.  Does anyone recall there being a belief test for astronauts before?  What was really amazing was that this religious extremism on the part of the government was supposed to be happening during the Clinton administration.  There was not one believable character in the government plot.There was no hint of scientific method.  The science was just plain bad.I'm reminded of many Star Trek episodes where someone says they heard voices or saw a vision.  The are immediately discounted as having stress problems or some other mental problem.  This on a ship where this type of stuff happens all the time.  This movie does this as well.  It protrays the entire world as not willing to pay any attention to what someone says when it's unexpected.  What did they expect?I could go on and on and about Contact.

journey to the unknown,"Since she was a young girl, Ellie Arroway has been obsessed with space and its unknown inhabitants. She has been meet with trouble for receive grants into her research of life beyond our realm of the galaxy. When her grant is running out and all look hopeless, a message from space arrives. The message is a pulsating noise in mathematical form, carrying information. On the deciphering this, Ellie and her team discover that the information are blue prints, to build a machine. The machine itself is a transportation mechanism, which they believe will take them to the machines maker and proof of intelligent lifeforms.Contact is a wonderful exploration of other life forms and the ramifications to this discovery. The realms of science and religion cross paths here, and they both have a show down. There are many themes explored in Contact; the destruction or re-enforcement of the higher being - God, if there is other life are they benign or malevolent, the religious undertones of faith and the search for truth. While the religious and scientific aspect do collide, they are neither condoned nor called irrelevant. Both hold relevant questions, while they don't have answer, they can't be discredited.Contact is surrounded in that mysterious unknown sense; very reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odessy. Both venture into the realm of intelligent life forms with unknown actions; are they here to help or bring our doom. While 2001 was more abstract and surreal, Contact hits hard with the science and religious side, yet still leaves room for interpretation; you are asked to make your decision.From the moment she appears on screen, Jodie Foster has that commanding presence. What makes this film believable is from Foster, you can see it in her eyes, delivering another strong performance. Matthew McConaughey brings one of his best performances as Palmer Joss, who can't relinquish his religious beliefs in search of higher beings. While the rest of the cast; Michael Chaban, James Woods, William Fichtner and Tom Skerritt don't give outstanding performances, Contact doesn't rely on them, as the story does circle around Ellie and Palmer, and Foster and McConaughey do hold the story strongly on their shoulders.Contact is a wonderful exploration into the heart of the unknown and the possibility of intelligent life forms, that space does hold tightly a secret.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A scientific sci-fi film,"As a scientifically literate sci-fi fan I find most SF movies, ultimately, rather irritating. But not this one. Firstly, the science is good (within the limits of the dramatic structure of a film) and, secondly, it deals with the political and social effects of such an event rather well. Besides those points, the film is well acted and full of good old human drama. It doesn't depend on spectacle.

It comes as no surprise then, when having the chance to read his book, "" Contact "" or at least seeing the movie, many more did not. What a loss.

Carl Sagan Managed to get his message through,"Originally a novel by Carl Sagan, an astronomer/philosopher, this film is a theological monologue (seeking to be a dialogue) in a manner of science fiction.  At the surface, this is a story about an astronomer Arroway who seeks for intelligence out in space.  She receives a message, which she decodes, and following the message, manages to build a space-ship-like structure.  After overcoming a series of obstacles, she gets to ride on the ship.Simultaneously, there's an intellectual/emotional relationship between a seminary drop-out minister Joss, who comfortably ""scores"" at the earliest stage of their acquaintance (no wonder he's dropped out of seminary).Underneath this narrative, we hear Sagan's attempt to reconcile Reason and Faith.  Arroway, who claims that mathematics is the only universal language, more or less represents ""reason"", whereas Joss represents ""faith"".On the one hand, we see the capricious side of religion, but then we are forced to admit that over 90 % of us belong to them.  In fact, you are not representative of humanity if you deny any ""greater being"".  We also hear Sagan when Joss says that it's not science or technology that corrupts humanity.  It's the incapability of humanity to handle them rightfully.  In other words, Sagan cries out and says, ""Religion is not against Reason per se.  Religion is sceptical of humanity which so repeatedly fails to handle Reason properly.""Until Arroway returns from the ""space trip"", she is far more convincing than Joss (i.e. we are led to be in favor of reason than faith).  The counter-balance takes place after she returns.  Her ""report"" is nothing but a ""sharing of testimony"" in an evangelical meeting (if you've ever attended one).  But this film does not give ""faith"" the victory, rather attempts to show both sides reaching out for each other.  Very post-modern.You can enjoy it either as a SF film or as a philosophical article which seeks for your response.

Pure sci-fi magic,This is worth seeing many times.  If anything can go right with a film it's this one.  All the acting is well done and the special effects are dreamlike in the last part of the film.  I watched with wonder.  Carl Sagan really wanted to know about other life in the universe. Sagan really has a distrust for government in this film and one can see why. This is one of the best films I've ever seen.

"Film Comparisons: The Next Voice You Hear, Day the Earth Stood Still, Red Planet Mars, Contact","Four speculative films:The Next Voice You Hear (1950) The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) Red Planet Mars (1952) Contact (1997)On three levels, these four films have aspects in common that make them an interesting film study. 1) Contact with a presence from beyond Earth, either from Heaven or somewhere in outer space. 2) Alien or God presents humans with message that cannot be ignored and which throws Earthlings into a certain level of turmoil about the implications of the message for humanity. 3) The contact has religious implications, either overt in The Next Voice You Hear, Red Planet Mars and Contact, or to a lesser degree in The Day the Earth Stood Still.I doubt that Carl Sagan would be pleased to see his humanistic book-turned-film Contact placed in this grouping, but I have enjoyed all four of these films and feel that they make for interesting comparisons.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Could be much better,"As always, Jodie Foster is a wonderful actress. The idea of the movie is very good, and the ""voyage"" of Jodie is incredible.  But the romantic story is a bore and all that White House crap destroys the movie.  I'm tired of Hollywood movies with the president of the USA in it (except for Tim Burton's Mars Attack!).

Science and Religion both use Faith,"Mostly out of respect for Carl Sagan I rate this 10 - It is in fact a diamond in the rough as others have said.As far as Production Value, the state of CGI Graphics when this film was made was poor - It could have been done better. That was the one thing that bothered me, some of the CGI was great, but at the time CGI was no good for planes, ships or a huge rotating Gyroscope. It was good however for storms and galaxies and planets.But despite this minor flaw, the sets were very well done, including Jody's ""spaceship"" and the structures surrounding it. But what drives this film is not how it looks, there are strong and weak aspects to that. What really drives this story is Character, and the fact that we ourselves can relate to the dichotomies presented here.Basically all through this film, Dr. Arroway refuses to see the merits of Faith, she only relies on what can be proved with Facts in Hand. But Faith in God cannot be accessed that way.This rigid thinking initially allows her to make her big discovery, but when it comes to the row she created and taking part in her own discovery, it prevents her from being originally picked as the person to represent man as a whole. We have Nick Lowe on one side representing the Conservative POV, and Matthew McConaughey on the other, who should be representing the Conservative/Religious POV but in fact Ms. Foster's character cannot see that he is actually her most valuable ally.This is how both Science and Religion should tread, they are in fact not at odds with each other, they complement each other. I think this was Carl Sagan's final statement with this book and film. Both require Faith to make work and if allowed to, Science and Religion can be used together to answer questions that neither alone can answer.I personally believe that if a machine like the one in the film were built, we would experience it differently from Within and Without.James Woods as the NSA chief almost reprises his great role as ""Citizen Cohn"" and Tom Skerritt reveals a Political Ass-Kisser and chump who is not above taking Arroway's discovery and using it for political gain, even while standing in her way earlier in the film. John Hurt in another chameleon role is SR Hadden, a mysterious recluse and main Arroway ally.And as much as Matt McConaughey bothers me, his character is pivotal to the film, as well as Gary Busey prodigy Jake as the psychotic religious fanatic which he so well represents. I believe all stereotypes are accounted for using appropriate actors.This film is worth sitting through, even though it moves slowly. Not many movies or TV shows lately have such a positive message to expound as this, but the source material and author says it all.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Surprisingly Thought-Provoking,"I was surprised at how well made and engaging this 1997 novel adaptation was (especially considering the mixed review scores on websites like Rotten Tomatoes). While I haven't read the novel, I can say that this version of the story is absolutely worth watching. While it may be long to some, I kept wanting to see what would happen next. The characters are relatively simple, but interesting and likable nonetheless. The performances are solid, even if some would argue the casting wasn't the best. The movie is exciting, but also surprisingly philosophical. There is lots of effective commentary on our place in the universe, and the conflicts between science and religion, which make the story more relevant today than ever. The effects have held up really well, surprisingly. With a good balance of practical effects and CGI. The technology looks realistic, and impressive. Everything looks real, like it could actually exist. I did think some of the dialogue was a little corny/unrealistic at the beginning, but I looked passed it as the movie went on, and was engrossed in the story. There is a surprising amount of warmth and heart, that makes this movie seem to have more of a soul. There were a fair amount of surprises in store, so I think it's best to go into this movie with little to no knowledge other than the synopsis. If you think it looks interesting, give it a watch.

Another actor would have filled the role in better and that is what a movie is about. See Flight for perfect casting.

"Interesting premise, comical execution","This movie adapts some ideas of physics advanced by some of the greatest minds to ever live. Unfortunately, those great minds had little do do with the execution of this movie.Jodie Foster is a renegade scientist with a chip on her shoulder who is convinced of the existence of extraterrestials, and their intervention in human history. Foster's acting is, as usual, extremely believable; however, the character is written like a bratty snot, who is surrounded by imbeciles. Somehow, contact with some unknown force does occur, providing an instruction manual for a device.Remember those gyroscopic toys kids used to play with? 'Nuff said. Apparently, this is how to travel through worm holes and what not. The gyro notwithstanding, other special effects are usually interesting, and the story has moments of original revelations to offer. Often, however, the movie falls back on clichés of government idiots and psycho zealots, before the scientist test drives her machine. What she experiences on her journey makes for a poorly contrived finale.The cast act enthusiastically, but their efforts are sunk by characters written as blithering idiots. They are not believable as people who would accomplish anything of this magnitude, nor does the film bother to make anything else plausible.

Get the deluxe DVD to explore just how difficult the movie was to make, the technical hurdles, the dedication of the actors. The deluxe edition has no fewer than three commentaries, one from Ms. Foster, one from the director and producer, and one from the technical team. Ordinarily, I would never listen to so much commentary coming from one movie, but I listened to them all, and watched the original movie over and over again to get a feel for the effort behind this production.

"One of my favourite films, both by Zemeckis and of recent sci-fi cinema!","I would readily admit this is one of my favourite science fiction films from the 90's. It's intelligent, well-acted and directed, and the special effects it has HELPS the story rather than IMPEDES it. Though she hasn't done much lately, either in the director's chair or acting, Jodie Foster is one of my favourite contemporary American actresses, and it's intriguing how her great talent's been utilized of late (ie., 'Elysium', and I'm still very mad at Spike Lee for having Christopher Plummer call her a 'cunt' in 'Inside Man').Personally, I must admit that I myself have worried what other worlds' inhabitants would think of our civilization from the messages it might get from Earth. Though I thankfully haven't lost any sleep over it (I have 'Thumper' in the apartment above me to thank for that), as Led Zeppelin would say in the classic 'Stairway to Heaven', '...and it makes me wonder'.As what happens in most of these movies, it's rather anticlimactic once the different cultures meet. I'll say to my dying day that the most difficult thing to do in cinema is end a film. Here (unlike perfect sci-fi masterpieces, like '2001: A Space odyssey' or the more recent 'Children of Men') the decent but otherwise unspectacular ending makes me avoid a perfect rating here. But it's awfully close, worth both owning and rewatching, and provides fairly early evidence (which would come to bold fruition in 'Killer Joe') that Matthew McConaughey could actually act. It's also a tossup between this, 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' and 'Back to the Future' for my favourite Zemeckis moment.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Contact,"Against advice from everyone in the establishment looking at stellar phenomenon, Jodie Foster's SETI scientist continues to look for extraterrestrial life. Inevitably she hears a signal which, once decrypted provides detailed plans to build some form of machine. Important people with the scientific community, politics and religious circles suddenly get very interested both in what to do next, who does it and what the societal implications are.Fabulously exciting and intelligent sci-fi thriller held nicely together by Zemekis and with a great central performance by Foster. What this does is examine how we'd react as a society if we really knew there was something out there. On the one hand you have the power of science and reason represented in the film by Foster and this clashes with the huge power of faith and spiritual implications, represented by Matthew McConaughey. Adding the real power though is politics in the guise of James Woods and Angela Basset from the Government and John Hurt as a dying zillionaire supporting Foster as he wants to go out having made his mark.Aside from all this fascinating debate which, if you avoid the nutters, seems to settle on there's room for both, just, there is the core sci-fi adventure. This is fascinating throughout and eventually reaches a satisfactory conclusion a la 2001. Great film.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It's hard to say whether or not I liked it.,"Here you have a three hour long movie that deals with the discovery of aliens, unknown life forms, perhaps god, and anything else that could come up in a discussion.'Contact' is definitely one of the best films ever put together. Why? Well, it has intelligent writing which is just enough for me to consider it to be great. But there's more to it like the good acting, the budget and how they used it in a fairly enjoyable way, the idea to bring this discovery/project to the screen, and above all, the fact that this is the future or the present.I personally found this film to be a little hard to follow. Yes, it had extremely creative and intelligent writing, which is why I liked it. But it also brought up many questions, answers and a script that I just couldn't keep up with. Obviously nobody else seemed to have this problem. In my opinion, you need to be partly up to today's technology to just get a grip on the plot outline. I could follow it for the most part, but when Ellie took her trip at the end, I really lost interest mainly because it was too complex.Jodie Foster was terrific as usual. She really put everything she could into the role of Ellie Arroway. She was nominated for a Golden Globe but sadly lost. The film was nominated for an Academy for Best Sound but lost. Somebody please explain to me why she wasn't nominated for and Academy Award. This was a performance that certainly was worthy of this award but wasn't even considered as one of the nominees. That has got to be one of the most disappointing things because she truly did deserve it. Not to mention that the movie itself wasn't even nominated. I'll get back to the cast. Matthew McConaughey was partly a good choice for being casted as Palmer Joss. His effort put into this role was once again very good. There's one problem. McConaughey just doesn't seem like the character that he portrays. Foster could get away with it but this guy can't. His performance: good. Expecting me to believe that he was this highly intelligent scientist: get real. Tom Skerritt who plays David Drumlin was okay but nothing fantastic. A good choice for this role but it could have been handled by a number of other people. There were so many people in this film with important roles that I can't remember them. Well anyway, the entire cast was good. Playing a scientist isn't always easy. I'll hand it to the crew for creating such a huge cast. Have you taken a look at everyone that was involved in this movie? This was a good way to make the idea and the plot come alive.When we're dealing with a Sci-Fi movie, a big budget is bound to come up. Most movies have a tendency to make the special effects overcome the film by turning the majority of it in an animated form. 'Contact' did have a big budget and everything was going good. I was pleased that there were some effects but not too many. Then that image was ruined. When it neared the end of the film or whenever Ellie finally takes her space trip, the animation did become too much. Her 'psychedelic' trip into wherever she landed was enough for me. Even the part where the machine (pod) gets destroyed. But it was ruined when the Pensacola drawing became somewhat real. Once again, this movie turned out like all of the others. This is the future of movies but is there any reason why 1 film has to have such a large budget to please the audience?I've yet to read the book. Half of the people consider the book to be better while the other half believes that bringing the book to life was a better choice. All I can say is that it was good to see a movie that actually did take a lot of time to create and didn't look like something that was put together in a week. I think that when a movie is created based on a novel, it shows that people still take the time to get the facts straight. Although this movie did take a lot of research to get it done, I found that it also had quite a few errors. Any other movie, I would frown, but being that 'Contact' had a good plot to go off of, I'll let it slide.While the budget had to cover the effects, it also covered a lot of changes of scenery. The machine itself, the control station or whatever the correct name for it is, the White House, the strip of satellites, and every other thing that was shown was greatly designed/set up. There is nothing better in a movie than seeing different shots of landmarks or anything. The worst is of course, viewing the same old set for the length of the movie.While I can say that I somewhat enjoyed the film, I did find some things that could be improved. 1) If this movie would have been shortened, it would have made it even better. I realize that a lot of time had to be taken up in order for the audience to get the real knowledge out of the point the crew was trying to make. And that this isn't the type of movie that can fit into an hour or two. But three!? 2) This film is definitely a serious film. Some basic or common knowledge about space could come in handy in order to follow it. It wouldn't hurt. But the writers, directors and everyone involved might have aimed a little too high.Did I like it or didn't I? I can't completely answer that for the reasons I have tried to explain. 'Contact' is an underrated film and Jodie Foster wasn't recognized enough for her performance. Worthy of a Best Picture nomination? Sure, why not. I've seen worse films nominated let alone win the award.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Thank God for 18 hours of static.,"This is one of those movies which work on so many levels... let's take the Hollywood level first.Jodie Foster does an *excellent* job as 'Ellie Arroway'... but she isn't alone in her excellence. James Woods plays the consummate a**hole, a role he plays quite well - in fact, there are points in this movie when you just feel the urge to yell at the screen, most of it unprintable. Matthew McConaughey does quite a good job, and his character is right on the mark... supportive and disbelieving at the same time. Each of them plays their roles in a way that is entirely believable... yet at the same time you want to question the role (not the actor, but the character). Skerrit also does a good job, limited though it is. They are believable *as the characters*... which is exactly what a movie is supposed to do.The camera work and the F/X are almost unbelievable... they are absolutely spectacular. While at one and the same time they portray the realities of life on Earth (the various satellite arrays, everyday rooms, council chambers), they also portray the wonders of the universe. One day we actually make it out there... only to find that Hollywood has beaten us to the point. Yet the Hollywood F/X don't leave us lost in a realm of... F/X; we can look at this (the star journeys, the systems, the arrays), and it looks real; or at least, real enough to be totally believable, which is the whole point of Hollywood.Yet as with any good movie, the special effects play second fiddle to the actors and the characters they play. You can have absolutely amazing  F/X, and yet have a bland and boring movie (such as ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture""). Here, the special effects - as beautiful as they are - definitely play second fiddle to the actors and their characters.With all of this, we can't forget the man behind the camera... Robert Zemeckis. He's brought us such slapstick broadsides as ""Ghostbusters"", but at the heart he is a filmmaker, a true director (not that ""Ghostbusters"" was false), and this movie shows it - he does an astonishing job, getting astounding performances out of his cast.The characters - based on the novel by scientist and philosopher Carl Sagan - are nothing less that miraculous... and oh-so-human. It's a very big round of applause to the various actors that you look at each of the characters and you can see where each one is coming from; whom they are supposed to be - that's what Hollywood is supposed to be like, and so rarely is. There are no fancy aliens in this; everybody is remarkable human. And very nicely done.A silly note: during the very beginning of the movie, when the camera view pulls out from Earth and into space, it's highly amusing that the words of (former President) Richard Nixon mix and blend with the theme to the ""Twilight Zone""...If you want to get into the metaphysical parts of the movie, it's solely about faith... faith in all its forms. It doesn't matter what you believe - this movie will probably represent your point of view. At the end, in front of the committee, we have one person asking Arroway (Foster) whether they should take everything on faith... which is especially ironic when you remember that one person (played by Jake Busey) has their own form of faith which destroys and kills... which faith do you believe? Or should we believe all of them? What is faith, other than an extreme belief in something which cannot be proven?In a final note - yes, this movie will make you think (if you have the brains to see outside your own narrow little world)... but in the end, it's the astonishing performances (mainly by Foster, but also by McConnaughey and Woods) that will pull you in.If you like anything other than hack-n-slash, then I'd highly recommend this movie to you... see it with an open mind, and perhaps it will make you *think*!If you've got even a little bit of openness in your mind, if you have ever asked ""Are we alone in the universe?"", then this movie will be quite satisfying... because it doesn't answer any of those questions; instead, it shows you how people - real people - deal with them. Very, very good.It's a mark of this movie that after watching it on DVD, you don't really care about all of the extras... the interviews, the director's comments - you've just seen the movie, which speaks for itself in every line; why spoil it with something else? But even as I say that, the director's (and others) comments on the second track are nice - hearing what they thought about this and that is a very interesting extra. Still, the movie itself - and Foster's excellent performance - is the real reason for buying this DVD.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Read the book.,"This poorly scripted and often contrived adaptation of Carl Sagan's masterpiece about a *group* of explorers *sharing* an incredible experience is something that really should be bypassed in favor of the original novel. Everything from the old Hollywood stereotyped female lead who can only be related to a male lead sexually (an old and unnecessary contrivance) to the writers of the movie almost literally putting words in Dr. Arroway's (Jodie Foster) mouth, to coin a phrase.

"Sci fi film makers, make Contact your benchmark","I've only recently joined IMDb, for the simple reason that I feel compelled to review Contact as the most brilliant movie of this genre. After watching so many more recent movies (Interstellar) I would like to implore all future movie makers of this ilk that they must watch Contact and take notes. This is one of my most favourite of movies ever made. Purely for the fact that it has many levels. First and foremost, the science is completely tangible. Why would it not be, after all, it was written by Carl Sagan. Secondly, there were so many breathtaking scenes. My favourite line from Hadden ""They still want an American to go. Wanna take a ride?"" Wow. That blows me away every time I see it. With the focus on religion vs science. The film leaves nothing to question. It brings forth the ethics of our actions and approaches these powerful subject matters and tackles them head on. For such a far fetched movie, the viewer is still able to grasp the story because of its loyalty to reality. You're made to care for Eleanor Arraway and accompany her on her epic journey. Going from a seti research scientist who is struggling to get the funding for her research. To a woman who is forced to confront political and religious barriers in the quest for science. I've seen this film a dozen times and I cannot fault it. It is magical, believable and stretches the imagination.

A different dimensional Sci-fi which is a gem to keep for coming years,"It may be yet another sci-fi movie where someone makes contact with 'aliens' but this time its different altogether. Its refreshing,bringing in the Most popular debate of SCIENCE vs GOD, giving a clear idea about what it is through a non-melodramatic Sci-fi style leaving us with a clear conception - both says the same ""Pursuit of the truth"".I was almost mislead to believe it as yet another aliens vs human movie but the course of the movie changed it. Though scripted brilliantly, it lacks in the screenplay and the dialogs could have been more powerful throughout the movie instead of showing only in some scenes.

Not sci-fi,"Sometimes I wonder how different people see and value a movie. Question is not if they just take popcorn or 10 bawling mates as companion, not if they do homework or talk entirely with their cellphone while important pictures pass the screen, go 5 times to toilet or are out for beer.The big question this film pulls up is why we struggle so hard in getting along with each other, why we fear, want and dislike possible ""neighbours"", why we don't believe what we can't see, also why we underrate our own existence, our hopes and dreams, why we reach out for new dimensions and once there's a little bit of answer soon boggle and deny because it disturbs the ""earthly"" universe.This is not a popcorn film. It requires attention and ability to disengage, to let loose. Pure Sci-Fi fans should go watch Starwars, Fantasy fans maybe Lord of the rings.

"Must see, and must think","Contact, for me, was simply a perfect statement of the need for appreciating that reality is most probably beyond the reach of one discipline by itself.The science/religion dichotomy should be accepted as, well, not good enough. Ellie, representing the scientist, is faced with experience that lies beyond her scientific explanation, yet she cannot let go of its reality to her.Palmer Joss is excellent, not as the representative of the religious, but as representative of the position we might do well to take - the line between the two extremes, the balance-seeker who can communicate beyond his own language (not one Bible text quoted, yet a decent defence of the room for ""God"").The bigger antennae is not a matter of technology, but, as we see in the last scene, of tuning in, making ""contact"" not with what's ""out there,"" but with what's inside of us - is it not more than just atomic activity?Meaning - a key theme, is shown to be lacking in the outlook on life these days, lacking in the continual pursuit of technological advance. Science alone is insufficient to give meaning that we are able to conceive and contemplate.This is a relevant thinking movie, for those who've thought that science and religion must antagonize.

Great Performance By Jodie Foster!,"Robert Zemeckis's Contact is actually a better film than I expected. For some reason, I was expecting this film to be a romance film with sci-fi elements added. Thankfully, this film turned out more to be an emotional drama with heartfelt performances and a chance to ask the viewer, ""can this be real?"" This film reminded me of Close Encounters of a Third Kind and in a good way. These films have positive messages on the outlook of what happens if aliens visited Earth.This film is about a very smart scientist who finally makes contact with a civilization not of this world. After dealing with skepticism, she finally convinces the world that all this is real. Tha aliens sends plans for the world to build a complex machine. What happens next?This movie features an all-star cast led by a powerful performance of Jodie Foster. I thought Matthew McConaughey was over-publicized because he wasn't in this film as much as I thought he would be but he still was pretty good. The supporting cast is one of the better supporting casts you would want to see in a film.Overall, this is a really good, thought-provoking sci-fi film. It has great visuals and they brought me to a sense of awe and wonder and truly made me think about if any other life exists and the ongoing battle between science and religion.

I didn't go for the obsession that Foster had for finding little green men. She played the part very convincingly though. But I really didn't care why, I was too busy rooting for her and hissing at Skerrit's character.Many people didn't like the ending. I thought it was the only right ending.

Another score for Jodie Foster in a wonderful film,"I am a fan of Jodie Foster since I saw ""The Silence of the Lambs"", where she shows one of the best performances by an actress ever. In ""Contact"" she proves one more time that she's just incredible. I can't understand why she wasn't nominated to the Oscar. Maybe because this film (that also deserved to be nominated) is very complex to the people in general- I am talking about the ones who liked ""Titanic"" (yuck!), ""Good Will Hunting"" (ugh!) and other dumb flicks.""Contact"" was one of the best films of 1997, a weak year for cinema, and it impressed me. The story is amazing, specially the last 30 or 40 minutes, which really kept my attention. This film, as another recent one - ""The Sixth Sense"" - is a thing to think about, and not just to watch and forget. Of course there are some moments when ""Contact"" fails, but the mistakes are very small and the film is great the same way.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The film that makes me feel less alone,"When I was a little girl Carl Sagan's TV Series ""Cosmos"" did for me what the spring does with the trees.

The cinematography, the plot, the acting- everything in this movie has layers and layers of beauty and soul. But for me the best feature of ""Contact"" is that it is a truly wise film- it doesn't presume to give us ultimate answers, it just gently leads us to asking even more questions.

A poetic and philosophical journey of science and faith.,"Contact is a well crafted film that is able to penetrate our sensibilities about the unknown. Are we alone in this great mass of space?

The spiritual and poetic opening to Contact, with it's sound to silence pull out to the distance universe penetrates the senses.The film tries to remain serious with it's ""Contact"".

There is political and religious debate as well as ego grabbers in this discovery.The special effects are beautiful and well crafted. It is a handsome film to ponder and discuss.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
a scientific critique of the film,"The movie ""Contact"" deals with many different aspects of what science is. Our three main characters, Eleanor (Ellie) Arroway, Palmer Joss, and David Drumlin, each have very unique opinions of science. Although each depicts a human character, each represents a different way of looking at science.Ellie Arroway's opinion of science is that the pursuit of science is the search for Truth. She is constantly searching for a higher meaning in life. She herself stated at one point in the movie, ""For as long as I can remember, I've been searching for some reason why we're here"" In her opinion, science is a means for acquiring knowledge and meaning. She uses science as a tool to discover more about our universe, because perhaps if we knew about other intelligent life forms out there, we might gain a little more knowledge about ourselves. She believes that there is no mystery in science, simply gaps in our knowledge, gaps which can be filled by understanding how we came to be.Palmer Joss is a drop-out theology student-turned-White House adviser, a very interesting and all-too-convenient character, always appearing at the right moments. However, he is key in this film because of his beliefs on what science is. Having come from a theological background, we would naturally believe he opposes science, and in the beginning of the movie, it certainly seems so. However, as the plot develops, so does Joss's character, and we realize how truly important his contribution to the movie really is. In the beginning of the movie, Joss says that science hasn't been able to give people the one thing they are most hungry for- meaning. He studies the harmful impact of technology on third-world people. However, he quickly combines his spiritual values with scientific facts and becomes the ultimate counselor to the White House. He brings about a sort of compromise between science and belief. He says at one point that he is not against technology, but rather against people who worship it at the expense of human truth. In short, his belief is that science is the search for truth, and if God is truth, as he believed, then God is technically science.Drumlin was incredibly distinct in his beliefs from Arroway and especially from Joss. He believed that science should be practical and profitable. Science should be practical in the sense that the science that people should practice should only be the kind of science that will advance us as a race and aid in our progress towards helping humanity. This is really what he means by profitable, too; certain sciences should not be practice if they mean pouring money into it and getting little in return. This is really why he opposed SETI. SETI was a project that demanded large sums of money, and he believed we would not get anything from it in return, not in the form of money or progress.Even though each of these vital characters has a distinctive opinion of what science is, they all use the same term for this tool, this system of knowledge, and therefore their opinions, however contrasting they may be, are very similar to each other's. They all have a true passion for knowledge that fuels both science and religion alike.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Contact provokes thought.,"For me, this movie cannot merely be classified as a Sci-fi film, it's much deeper than that.  I see it as an exploration, not only into the depths of space, but also into the depths of human religion and the science that compliments or confronts it.  Through Ellie, it chronicles the individual's personal spiritual odyssey, an evolution and maturation.  At the same time, it shows us our place in the Universe and presents possibilities of a far-reaching and awe inspiring reality.  Contact provokes thought.So essentially, my love for this film emanates from the fact that it encourages you to think.  (I would say ""makes you think"", however, there are those who can't be ""made"" to.)  Of course there are different levels at which this film's contents can be thought through and analyzed.  On one level it may cause you to realize things about the world you never saw before;  question long held religious beliefs, causing them to change or become affirmed.  It may turn your brain on to the wonders of space and you may ponder the possibility of intelligent life elsewhere in the Universe. On a deeper level, it may turn on your soul to the inherent awe inspiring beauty of the cosmos and your own place in it's vastness- opening your spirit and finding your connection to a greater energy.Like a good book, this movie is interpreted and experienced in different ways by different people; but I think on all levels this is a wonderfully engaging movie that plays on human emotions by capturing imagination.  At the center of it all we find Jodie Foster, who I feel, plays a major part in what makes this movie so wonderful.  She portrays Eleanor Arroway with the perfect blend of a scientific mind and a longing, lonely heart.  She truly did an exceptional job, doing justice to the deep character Sagan created, and I literally cannot envision Contact with any other actress.Again, as I've said, this movie, its characters, situations, and deeper meaning can be pondered and analyzed for many conclusions on multiple levels.  For instance, the role of Palmer Joss can be thought of as representing religious faith, with Ellie representing scientific questioning.  These two entities can, at times, be so far apart, each seeing the world from an opposite context.  However, in one of the wonders and perfections of the world, these critically different entities can come together in a union of thought and emotion, science and spirituality, by seeking to understand the other point of view and creating the beautiful possibility of mutual acceptance.I could go on and on about my further thoughts on Contact (but don't worry, I won't!), for the fact is, if you like a movie experience- not just movie viewing- this film will engage you.  There is so much Contact has to offer, its brilliant blend of an incredible story, convincing screenplay, thought out directing, and perfect casting, makes for an unforgettable movie experience- that is, if you let it.  Not everyone finds so much depth and inspiration in Contact as I do, therefore, I continue to believe that a movie is what you make of it.  But I promise, if you open yourself up to wonder, let yourself succumb to awe, and place yourself in the context of the Cosmos, you can get more than you ever expected out of this film.

"an ideas movie without the ideas, partly salvaged by its star","Jodie Foster can almost persuade you that this great flat slab of a film has some real weight. She's a master of the art not of rising above her material but appearing to raise the material itself, and she's terrific here, giving a concentrated and beautifully controlled performance as someone who has built toughness around herself like a metal sphere, who's pathologically driven, emotionally not so much fragile as seemingly broken beyond repair. Contact works best on its psychological level, as a portrait of the scientist as a young orphan, and it's worth seeing for Foster's performance, as well as for a couple of bravura effects sequences.Overall, though, it does not work either as philosophy or as drama, something that becomes painfully obvious when almost anyone but Foster is on screen. Contact wants to persuade you that it's a counterblast to the pulping and Hollywooding of science fiction, that it's a film of ideas. It's just that when you look closely, there are no ideas, no insights, just a set of stagy confrontations between crude and unconvincingly-depicted representations of certain types - the will to power, the will to faith, the will to knowledge.  They argue at each other for a bit (quite a bit, actually), there's a fantastic voyage, quite beautifully rendered, to a destination which comes straight out of TV movie land, and then we're back to the arguing at each other again.  This is a film that believes it can attain profundity by having its characters make statements a lot; it's addicted to the obvious, unimaginatively directed, slackly edited and with damaging plot holes, and has nothing whatever to say to anyone about anything that you couldn't get from the back of a cereal packet.With a couple of honourable exceptions the supporting cast do the opposite of supporting, mostly because their roles are so banal that there really wasn't anything to be done with them.  McConnaughey is unspeakably dreadful as the token lurve interest, while, more surprisingly, John Hurt is just embarrassing in a small but dramatically pivotal role.  The honourable mentions go to Jena Malone as Jodie in flashbacks - an excellent match for the star - and William Fichtner as the likeable Kent (one of the film's few concessions to subtlety is its not labouring the character's blindness, where lots of nudges about Vision would have been more characteristic), while Tom Skerritt as the opportunist Drumlin - not a good role - has a couple of good moments.  But this is Foster's show, and if you watch it to see her, plus a few belated minutes of visual grandeur that really do convey the sense of wonder for which the dialogue thrashes about so feebly, you'll find things to admire here, if not much to enjoy or excite.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Overrated,"I made the mistake of reading the book first, even though I should know that movie adaptations are never as good. And this movie is no exception. The book is deeper, more intelligent and much more imaginative. The movie is more contemporary and seems a bit dumbed-down. The climax when Ellie meets the alien intelligence is too short, and nowhere near as profound as it is in the book. The best part of this meeting (the revelation of evidence of God found in the number Pi) is completely missing in the movie. As a result, it ends up looking like these aliens brought Ellie all the way across the universe, but didn't have anything to say to her once they got her there. I still thought it was an okay movie, good PR for the SETI program, and more intelligent and thoughtful than your typical sci-fi or hollywood movie. Nevertheless, nothing new or profound is said about the themes that are explored in the movie; any first-year philosophy or divinity student would be ashamed of the discussions these issues are given here. At least the movie had the guts to address these themes of spirituality, faith and meaning in the first place, which is more than can be said for most movies. I would have enjoyed it a little better if i hadn't read the book first, but not by that much.",,Anonymous,Mystery

It has been 5 years since I first saw Contact and here I am at some ungodly hour moved to express the real love I have for this film.Not since Kubrick has a film struck a chord so deep within me and engaged me in so much self-debate about those larger questions ... are we alone? ... do you (should you) believe? ... is faith a characteristic that ultimately brings religion and science closer together? ... are we all seeking the same answers?Carl Sagan was the prototypical pragmatist. In his work as an astronomer and through his various commentaries, he came to be seen as a great respecter of fact and enthusiastic seeker of truth, a realist who saw SETI as a valid scientific extension of that hypothesis-based approach. Yet, in the end, the 'science' of Contact proves not to be enough and we are left to believe or to doubt, to have faith in the protagonist and her assertions despite a lack of any conclusive evidence or to chuckle along with the Hirt character.We know the fundamental importance of faith in all things religious but has any vehicle other than this film ever made a more literate argument for the importance of faith in things scientific?""Did your father love you?""

"brilliant, seminal, touching film","Contact was by and far cheated for any Oscar nominations in 1997.The adaptation of Carl Sagan's novel of the same name masterfully slimmed plot lines and complexities from the book into a beautifully cut work of intellect and heart.Jodie Foster, brilliant as always, works wonders as a freethinking astronomer searching for answers to her own life's meaning through seeking out intelligent life in the universe.The rest of the cast create Sagan's biting (and in no way completely impartial) cross-section of political and religious forces opposing Foster's imposed heroine efforts.  From Tom Skerrit's anti-villain Drumlin to Matt McConaughey's stellar Joss, to James Woods' scathingly funny Kitz and Angela Bassett's hotheaded White House staffer Constantine, everyone pulled their weight as an accurate representation of how the modern world would respond to such a thought-provoking event in history.Summed up, Contact is a debate on science versus faith that encompasses nearly every nuance of every shell on the topic, from religious viewpoints to scientific standards, to the very message the film tries to deliver: that ""in all our searching, the only thing we found to make the emptiness bearable is each other.""See this movie if you want to cry with comfort that you are not alone.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Perhaps my favourite film of all time.,"I love a movie with brains, and this movie provides. Written by acclaimed scientist and intellectual Carl Sagan, this book is overflowing with scientific facts and philosophical ideas. I eat it up every time; this film truly challenges you to think. But that aside, it is an excellent and well-made movie, containing action (near the end), romance (here and there), suspense, mystery, betrayal. Everything but war is included. Yet it flows smoothly despite this, and the two and a half hours whisk by, at least to me.Perhaps I'm biased; I first saw this movie when it first came out in '97, when I was 11, and it has been a family favourite ever since. It was only when I saw it again recently that I realized how amazing of a movie it is.Jodie Foster, as usual, does an amazing job, stealing the show when she needs to. The other actors are all worthy of mention, too. The special effects are very impressive, and so far they have withstood the test of time. The music, by Silvestri, is typically beautiful and fitting. The writing and dialogue are on the mark.I'm having trouble understanding why this film only has a 7.3 in here; its rating should be in the 8's, if I had my way. I'd recommend this film to everyone, and its tameness (rating wise) makes it largely appropriate for children. Even people who don't like science-fiction will like this, since it isn't until near the end.And that's my three cents.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

An absolutely marvelous film.,"This is my favorite film of all time. This movie captures my heart so much because it makes me imagine what extraordinary experience will be the defining moment of my life. Imagine your life's goal coming true and you are the only person on the planet who will ever be able to savor that experience. An utterly incredible premise.What also fascinated me so much about this movie was how the concept of intelligent life on other planets never deteriorated to the special effect and explosion extravaganzas that almost always characterized films in this genre. Contact, thanks to the book written by Carl Sagan, was put together thoughtfully and intelligently. I also thought that Jodie Fosters character received a major boost in the movie, which made the plot incredibly complex, enormously deeper than what meets the eye. Many of the internal conflicts of her character were presented in the earlier parts of the movie and you have to pay attention and catch them to understand just how significant each scene was. Then you will appreciate how important Matthew McConnahey's character was. If you passively absorb the movie, you will not get much of it! And if you catch those ""cues,"" you will understand why they made the ending like that.Technically, I was totally blown away by the discovery sequence. I was also completely astonished by the entire second half of the film. The physics, the visuals, the editing were so well blended into the fabric of her transportation that I was stunned agasp.

CONTACT spoiled by MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY's performance,"I thought the film was fine until it became clear that our boy Matthew McConaughey was going to play such a significant role in it. I had the distinct impression that Tom Skerrit held Matthew in contempt--see the film and judge for yourself. And by that I mean Skerrit the ACTOR held McConaughey the...actor...in contempt.Notice in the ONE scene where Jodie Foster and McConaughey kiss, they're about 4 inches from kissing when Foster blocks our view with her hand so we don't see their lips actually TOUCHING. Would any one of the great modern actresses want a record of herself kissing Pauly Shore? Would you? Foster probably couldn't go through with it, and you can't blame her for not wanting there to be a record of it on film.....Similarly in their bedroom scene together McConaughey lies in bed like he's posing for GQ; Foster, to her credit, plays the scene well, and convinces you they'd made love and she'd had fun. McConaughey looked like he'd been admiring himself on Larry King the whole time.....Later, when Foster leaves a Congressional committee investigation where she'd been grilled by skeptical Enron-enriched Republican congressmen, she sees her beloved Matthew standing alone in the hallway. She runs to him, throws her arms around him, and tells him how happy she is to see him again; McConaughey doesn't move, he barely acknowledges her at all. He looks like he's posing for a statue--THE STATUE OF LIMITATIONS. Little wonder that in end-of-the-year polls in ESQUIRE and THE NATIONAL ENQUIRER, McConaughey was voted 'WORST ACTOR OF THE YEAR' for CONTACT in both publications and, understandably (and significantly), 'WORST SUPPORTING ACTOR' for Speilberg's AMISTAD in the ENQUIRER.

"Despite crucial error, this is an involving story","One crucial error the filmmakers made in adapting Carl Sagan's excellent book is how they watered down Palmer Joss (it also doesn't help that Matthew McConaughey isn't entirely convincing in the role).  The argument of science vs. religion, or whether the two were compatible or mutually exclusive, was crucial to the book, and Palmer Joss was not only a three-dimensional character, he also had a clear point of view.  In the movie, however, his religious beliefs are just a generalized mishmash, and the movie suffers because of it.Still, this movie is quite powerful.  Jodie Foster shows why she was perfect casting as Ellie Arroway, using not only her intelligence, but her innner strength and vulnerability to play the character, and they all fit.  If the religion suffers, the science is well done without being too technical, and the filmmakers capture the wonder of it all without entering ""gee-whiz"" territory.  Many criticized the ending, but I think this is the one case that the relgion part wasn't dumbed down.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The best movie ever made based on the best book ever written.,"When I first saw the trailer for Contact, I immediately went out and bought the book. I loved it. It's the best book I've ever read, but the movie is even better. I have to say that Jodie Foster should have received the Oscar for best actress. Her performance as Ellie Arroway was superb. This is a great movie that everyone alive should see.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Excellent film about the spirituality of science,"Contact, based on Carl Sagan's novel of the same name, encourages us to question what it would truly mean if we found out that we might not be alone in the universe. Oftentimes it's seen as though the only people who would be called to handle such a discovery would be the leading scientists and the politicians. Contact argues that the scope would be much larger than that, because the impact of finding that we did not evolve alone nor were we created alone would affect us on all levels, both rational and spiritual.And for the most part the film handles these ideas and questions very well. The story is told from the point of view of Eleanor Arroway (Jodie Foster), who is one of the foremost astronomers in the world and who has taken it upon herself to search for signs of extraterrestrial life. And one day she hears a signal in the darkness of space, a signal that cannot have come from any human source. Coded within that signal the human race finds blueprints for a machine.The film takes great cares to keep the religious aspect of this discovery relevant to the plot. Matthew McConaughey's character Palmer Joss, a renowned Christian philosopher, is central in this undertaking, but personally I find his constant presence somewhat problematic from the point of view of the story because he's often railroaded back into the plot to spout his point of view and opinions. The film needs him to explore its themes, but he is handled somewhat clumsily as a character, thus making his message less effective.I'm also one of those people that really don't like the ending. And there are people that absolutely love it, but it's one of those endings that divides opinions left and right. I find it to be overly sentimental and to undermine the overall message of hope and discovery the movie has. But then again, some people find the biggest source of hope to be the ending itself and they like how the film gives the choice for them to decide what they want to believe. Bottom line being that you have to see the film and decide what you think about it.Contact is a fantastic science fiction film. It's got one of the greatest minds of the century behind its story, making it far deeper and thought-provoking than almost any film of its genre. I personally dislike some of Sagan's tenets, but I cannot dismiss the thought he has put into them. And that makes this film more than worthy of being watched and appreciated.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The best SciFi movie i ever watched,"Outstanding movie. It touches your deep core. For me this the best movie i have ever seen in Science Fiction.

I am in 2023 and i have to go back to 90s movies to feel it. The story, the acting, and the human feelings are at its top representation in this act.

Most intelligent sci-fi film to date,"Combine the intelligence, creativity and workmanship of Carl Sagan, Jodie Foster, and Robert Zemeckis and how can you get anything other than one of the two best sci-fi films ever made (the other being 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY)? Start with Carl Sagan's extraordinary book (which, although the film follows it pretty faithfully, you should still read for further enrichment). Add the Zemeckis seamless cinematic execution and technical wizardry (a la FORREST GUMP and BACK TO THE FUTURE). Then give the lead to Jodie Foster and let her run with it. Foster is arguably the _only_ actress who could carry the character of Dr. Ellie Arroway: brilliant, enthusiastic, strong but vulnerable, and unself-consciously sexy.Fine supporting performances are given by Matthew McConaughey (who in my opinion is unfairly trashed by critics), Tom Skerrit (who escapes the customary one-dimensionality of sci-fi antagonists), and David Morse. There are a host of walk-ons by journalists and public figures, from Dee Dee Myers up to Bill Clinton, but the best cameo is reserved for Rob Loew, who is _perfectly_ cast.Zemeckis excels in fleshing out settings, and his efforts in CONTACT are among his best. The TV clips and the ad hoc RV city in the New Mexico desert are especially delightful. The big set piece, a catastrophic explosion, is also excellent; the sense of immediacy and sickening dread as the event unfolds is reminiscent of what one experiences when seeing actual video footage of an air-show crash or a race car careening into the crowd. Possibly the most memorable scene in the film is the opening astronomical sequence, which will equally delight the professional astronomer and the scientifically uninitiated. Just that one scene is worth the price of buying the movie to watch over and over.The laserdisc transfer, which features Dolby Digital sound, is technically very good (especially the sound), although probably not among the very best. I would probably check out the DVD version first.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

One of the truly great science fiction films of all time.,"In an era of science fiction films where aliens are becoming increasingly unoriginal, and much less intelligent (their motherships' are now Macintosh compatible apparently), a film like ""Contact"" comes along, and makes us remember why science fiction can be one of the most intriguing genres in film.This film ranks right up there with other remarkable science fiction films such as, ""E.T."" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"".  All are truly great films that show us aliens that are more human and realistic than the aliens from films like ""Independence Day"" and ""The Astronaut's Wife"" where all the aliens seem to want to do is destroy every new life form they meet. Which poses this question, why would they waste their time on us?  Surely a race of beings who have conquered interstellar travel, would not see us as a legitimate threat.  But then again, maybe they don't think as clearly as perhaps they once used to.In the opening shot of the film, we are blessed with one of the great curtain-opening shots in film history.  A remarkable pullback that starts at Earth, pulls back through the outer reaches of our universe, and gradually changes into the eye of our main character Ellie Arroway.  This shot is a great summation of how movies can have a size as immense as the universe, and still be heartfelt and intimate at the same time.Ellie played by Jodie Foster is a scientist who spends her time listening to radio waves from deep space.  One night as she is listening to these, a clear signal comes through.  It turns out that after all this time that we have been sending out information across the galaxy, someone has heard us and responded.  As it turns out the message from space comes with instructions to build a machine.  But what does the machine do?  Is it a security risk to build it?  Eventually it is believed that the machine is possibly a transport to another world, but the catch is, only one person may go.  And this begins a debate between science and religion.  Did the message in fact come from God?  Should our first ambassador be a man of God, or a man of science?  The film deals with these questions, and gives honest answers on both sides of the argument, and it does so with an intelligence that is rarely seen in the movies these days.I won't spoil the ending, for it simply has to be seen to be believed. But I would like to congratulate everyone who was involved with the making of this film.  From Robert Zemeckis' incredible direction, to Alan Silvestri's breathtaking score, to the wonderful performances of Jodie Foster, Matthew McConaughey, James Woods, and David Morse.  If you have not yet seen this film, please do yourself a favor and see it.  It is a brilliant science fiction film that will give you your faith back in the genre.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Three words: Read the book,"Prime example of a book being squashed into a visual audience's attention span.  Fair movie, but skip it and read the book.  Carl Sagan's Contact is far and away one of the best modern-day science fiction tales skillfully written, but all of the gentle moments of character revelation are crammed into sound bytes to fit under 3 hours for Zemeckis's version.  Plus you lose Carl Sagan's original description of a semi-solidly formed global society where past sins are forgiven, as gender- and nation-based dissimilarities can be overlooked as the earth moves on.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Among the best realistic science fiction films....,"In '97, I read the book, Contact (Sagan, 1985) and then saw the movie.  I was not disappointed, although the movie was so much different from the book, and I wished they could have put more elements from the book into the movie.  The acting is great, especially with Jodie Foster.  The special effects are not really that wowing and they are not meant to be, it is supposed to be realistic, and they achieved their goal.  As a fan of Carl Sagan, I think this movie did justice for him, although he did not live to see it.The acting is very strong, especially with Jodie Foster.  She did a good job of bringing Ellie's character to life.  Another important actor in the movie, Matthew McConaughey, also did a good job of bringing Palmer Joss to life.  The rest of the characters were rather shuffled to the background, except for two annoying ones (James Woods character and Tom Skerrit's).  You have to keep rewinding the parts with the Christian Fundie character.  He's funny.The story of the film is great, even if different from the book, and is a little slow at first, but then its not a sci-fi action flick.  Some people groaned at the ending, but this is not a movie that lets you see anything. It's most important messages are that all humans have are themselves, and I think more people need to realize that.I highly recommend this film, and again, try to get it on DVD. ****1/2 stars (out of *****).",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Finally, a proper science fiction film","I've noticed that people either love this film or they hate it.

The only problem people may have is with the ending which is meant to be metaphorical, but can come across as a bit hokey and contrived.It's hard to describe the film without giving too much away. I'd say you really need to experience it and make up your own mind.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The last great sci-fi's super-production,"After the release in 1968 of Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", sci-fi reached his maturity and it lived great moments of triumph and success in the 70's and 80's with movies like ""THX 1138"", ""Logan's Run"", ""Blade Runner"" and ""Terminator"", among others. In the 90's, nevertheless, sci-fi lived other kind of moment thank to movies like this. Based on the Carl Sagan's novel book of the same name, I think that this movie exceeded the book to be a show of first class: a spectacular cast, good described characters, impressive F/Xs, excellent locations around the world and a well-studied look in every frame filmed by Robert Zemeckis turns this movie in a tour de force for the people who enjoy of one the best movies appeared in 1997. It is a deep reflection about our origin and place in the cosmos so like an emotional travel to answer the eternal question: ""is there anybody out there?""Behind of this simple question, it hides an intense look inside us. The movie forces us to look inside our hearts and souls, reviewing our hopes and fears about the possibility not to be the only one living race in the universe. Jodie Foster, turned in the heroine of the show, is a scientist who fights against all odds in her search to find extraterrestrial life in the universe. Her search has success when a message from the stars come to Earth that it suggests that not only there's life but it exists a way to contact it. Through of her eyes we see all the human reactions that the existence of alien life causes, from fear and paranoia to euphoria and hope. Through the characters, we can see all kind of people, from good ones and honest who looking for the common good to bad ones that they are crazy or they want success and power at all costs. Like all good sci-fi's movie, in the end ""Contact"" talks about humanity, about human condition and about human beings.After ""Contact"" there hasn't been other movie like this. No one of the next sci-fi hits (Armageddon, Pitch Black, Alien Vs Predator, Pandorum, etc...) kept the capacity to make a reading of the humanity like the old movies did (""2001"", ""Blade Runner"" or the own ""Contact""). I think that this ability, obligatory to make any great sci-fi movie, has been lost. Above his mistakes, ""Contact"" mixes elements that turns him in an amazing show for all ages: personal dramas, ambition, search of the truth, conspiracy, love, treachery, loss of beloved beings, thriller and includes a little of comedy. The visual force is so big that by it and others reasons I say that ""Contact"" is the last great sci-fi's super-production: because the search of extraterrestrial life species is essentially the search of our own identity like human species.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

This movie makes the Universe itself seem shallow,"This movie is hopelessly inept, which is a shame since it initially promises entertainment AND enlightenment. We root for Dr. Arroway, the strong non-sexualized female scientist/protagonist. All is crushed, however, by the weight of solemn movieplex convention: shouting into the wind, unfolding steadycam vista with soaring soundtrack, eccentric billionaire and nefarious black shoe, and technology so shiny it resembles a high-end cosmetic counter. Ideationally, the movie has all the intellectual courage and wisdom of a Howard Hughes anti-commie second feature of the fifties starring a semi-sober star in retrograde. More specifically, the faith vs science argument is propped up, referenced, alluded to, and even enacted (at times), but nothing is resolved in a meaningful way. We learn that space is very very big, space travel is like a waterslide, that ancestor worship can pay spiritual dividends, and that science is very similar to religion, in that both can be overlaid with sloppy sentimentality and imbued with supernatural talismans of womblike delight. This movie makes the universe seem shallow.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"A very, very good film about science and faith","Contact is a moving film about whether science and faith can coexist wrapped all up in sci-fi trappings. And Zemeckesis' and Sagan's (who wrote the rough draft of the script) conclusion is that they can. Jodi Foster's character represents the side of atheistic analyzer and Matthew McConaughey represents faith and experience. The film however puts it magnificently that though they are bound by different covenants, they are still seeking the same thing: truth. Rarely is Hollywood brave enough to tackle such hot and deeply personal issues in a film; and rarely do they do it so engagingly. This film will dazzle your eyes, move your heart, and stimulate your brain. For any who would claim to be religious and condemn science as of the devil or to any who would claim to be an atheist and condemn the faithful as ignorant and inferior human beings, I have one message for you: see this movie!

Intelligent Science Fiction,"I saw this movie at a then state of the art movie house with surround sound down here in San Diego and I have also watched it several times at home. I don't get tired of watching it and that says a bunch about the quality of the movie.Since so many people have written about the intriguing interplay between science and religion with its hopefulness themes, I thought I would bring up some more of the nuts and bolts aspects of this movie that were mostly great as well.Lets start with film editing and sound editing. That delicate theme song of the 9 year old Elli with were father is literally perfect, and I don't give praise easily. When the scene shifts to present day with the same notes but done in an orchestra setting to emphazise growth and maturity, it flows seamlessly. The night sounds at the Aracebo observatory are beautifully subdued but still noticeable even with the hum of computer fans droning along. More examples of great music and sound are as follows: The heavy sad notes that surround the heart attack scene. They are impactful to the scene but are timed to move on to the next scene of morning in which lots of more subtle sounds are used.Rustling of leaves a quiet moment and and a final short dirge to end it. My overarching theme here is how the director and sound editor let the music be a subtle accent rather then an overpowering guide to the key action or emotional moments. Of course the pulsing violins during the big action scene at the VLA New Mexico is the creme de la creme. It activates a short burst of excitement and just flows perfectly and then cuts out all together when Elli enters the control room. This gives me a sense of believable reality in which the action is carried on by the scientific process of discovery so well acted by Elli's team. Finally the sounds of the machine are completely believable, and peak with the point where the machine reaches its maximum velocity. Then the base music sounds indicating power come in for added impact. The effect is line with which Carl Sagen would have liked, that being complete humbleness around an exponentially advanced technology.I could go into other nuts and bolts but I have to do some other things so I will say that this movie is a very watchable movie. Its just plain great entertainment that asks more intelligent questions then most movies. The action and special effects are first rate as well. Robert Zemeckis is a top talent as far as I'm concerned so I'll keep popping it in the DVD player every few months for another great ride.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Consistently engaging and thought-provoking,"In some indigenous societies, the Milky Way is regarded as the road to the afterworld, the millions of stars in the night sky reflecting the souls of the deceased. Several extinct Native American Indian tribes whose beliefs are preserved in their mythology also imagine the spirits of the dead simply flying up out of their bodies to join other souls in the stars moving across the firmament. In Egypt, by the Middle Kingdom, tomb art began to depict star charts and it was thought that anyone who was given the correct burial rites could become a celestial body upon death.Though there is much room for interpretation, the association of stars with the deceased is suggested in Robert Zemeckis' ground breaking science-fiction film Contact. Based on the late astronomer Carl Sagan's 1985 novel, Contact is a big-budget film that has all the stunning visual effects (and some Forrest Gump-like gimmicks) one would associate with this kind of project but it also has much more. It is a consistently engaging and thought-provoking film that includes a strong ensemble cast. Two-time Oscar winner Jodie Foster brings a ton of passion and conviction to the role of young scientist Ellie Arroway and we are never in doubt that she is the probing, determined seeker after truth that she is portraying.Other strong performances come from James Woods as the overbearing National Security Adviser Michael Kitz who perhaps has seen too many Hollywood movies about bug-eyed monsters, John Hurt as oddball Billionaire financier S. R. Hadden, and Tom Skerritt as the ego-centered David Drumlin, the President's National Science adviser, who wants a piece of the action and the fame that goes with it. The film begins with a gorgeous sequence allowing us to visualize what it would be like to go on a tour of the universe (minus other tourists, of course). We take one small step for mankind as we visit the Moon, pay our respects to Mars, the Roman God of War, sweep through the asteroid belt, glide past Jupiter, become dazzled by the rings of Saturn, then head for places unknown and undreamt of in our philosophy.When we come back to Earth, we find ourselves in the 1970s as nine-year-old Ellie Arroway (Jean Malone) eagerly listens for messages on her short-wave radio as her father Ted (David Morse) offers encouragement. After her father's sudden death, Ellie dedicates her life to carry on her father's wish to probe the mysteries that science has not yet explained. Fast forward about fifteen years where a now mature Ellie (Jodie Foster) is a researcher for the SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) Institute, the program where radio signals are sent out to space seeking a coded response from any intelligent life in the universe that happens to have their radios on listening to Beyoncé.Although philosopher/author Terence McKenna proclaimed that, ""To search expectantly for a radio signal from an extraterrestrial source is probably as culture bound a presumption as to search the galaxy for a good Italian restaurant,"" it is during the course of this experiment that a radio signal from a star system 26 light years away provides instructions for building a machine for intergalactic travel, the means to forever end humanity's cosmic isolation. Securing private funding, the machine is built and the era of space exploration begins, though the results are nothing like you imagined.To its credit, Contact does not limit itself to the scientific aspects of Ellie's voyage to the stars but also focuses on her growth as a person. Although the obligatory romance between Ellie and religious scholar Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey) is tacked on unconvincingly, it does not detract from Ellie's ability to transcend the limitations of both science and religion and learn to appreciate, in the words of one African tribe, ""the thing that knowledge can't eat."" The question of belief in God comes up often in the film and Ellie's ""lack of faith"" is used to initially prevent her from being selected as the first space traveler but her deeply personal experience in space and her response to the awesome beauty of what she witnesses renders the question of belief irrelevant.Contact is an intelligent and often moving exploration of subjects Hollywood steers away from ninety percent of the time: Who are we and what is our place in the universe? Are we alone or one species among many? (Sagan said, ""If we are alone, it would be an awful waste of space."") What happens when we die? How will people react to contact if and when it occurs? The film, however, does not provide answers or tell us how to think and what to believe. What it asks of us rather is that we awake to the realization that we live in a universe that is full of mystery, one that may be very different from the one in which we have been taught to believe, and that the cosmos may now be beckoning to us to come home.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

After a tragedy involving the first pilot, Ellie is then chosen to journey in the machine, and the destination and aftermath will only further controversy and discussion...

This movie defines SF of the 90's like The Godfather was the penultimate 70's drama.The effects, the story line, the lack of cinematic ""extras"" that detract from the book, they all add up to a great presentation.A great movie, like a great book, makes you walk away thinking ""that could really happen!"" Contact is such a film.You hardcore SF readers that haven't been to a movie adaptation of a book since De Laurentis gave Baron Harkonnen the disgusting skin condition way back in 1984: read Contact (like you haven't already) and then enjoy the film.

"Jodie Foster's Performance. ""So beautiful...I had no idea.""","I was actually inspired to write this after seeing the AFI special on CBS, and their recognition of the top actors and actresses of our time -- prior to 1959 (I believe.) It got me thinking about current actors and who could possibly fill the shoes of those greats from the golden era of cinema. People like Judy Garland, Kathyrn Hepburn, Bette Davis, etc.Jodie Foster. Definitely. And I didn't reach this conclusion based on her two previous Best Actress Academy Awards. ""Contact"" was not a landmark film with a boffo box office. But it was an extremely well made and provocative movie that I enjoyed immensely. And more than the film, I enjoyed Jodie Foster's performance. There are many in the industry who, hush hush, may think twice when casting her in a romantic role opposite a male lead, the thinking goes: everyone 'knows' ... and somehow that detracts from her believability ... that we are watching someone whom we know is acting, because she cannot possibly be feeling what she's is supposed to be feeling when she kisses an actor in a sensuous manner.Painful for me to admit, but I used to be one of them ...until I saw her in ""Contact.""Foster's acting ... in two sequences in particular, transcended all of that for me: 1) the ""Okay to go"" sequence, and.... 2) ""It's so beautiful, I had no idea"" sequence.When AFI does it's eventual salute to Jodie Foster, as will AMPAS -- those sequences will stand out and should be included in her body of work sampling, precisely because ""Contact"" was not a milestone film. Jodie carried that film, and single-handedly propelled it to where it had to go -- during the climax, acting against SFX without the benefit of playing off another actor. In the hands of a lesser performer, the magic and mystery and awe that Carl Sagan was trying to imbue into this film would not have been realized.""I'm okay to go...okay to go... okay to go.."" Simple words of dialogue, really. What the actress does with them is a revelation and tribute to her skill and God-given talent. The pod is about to descend into an unknown abyss and travel through another dimension. ""I'm okay to go."" Scientific words. But in her hands, and in the way she delivers them... she made me cry. They embodied the core desire of the main character with such realism, such raw emotion, made all the more so because they were tinged with a combination of fear, excitement, courage and the indomitable human spirit, HER spirit -- within context of the film and, somehow for me, within context of her life -- that I could only tear up and cry and love her.Then again, when the character describes what she sees at the pivotal climax of ""Contact"" -- ""A celestial event ... so beautiful ... so beautiful ... I had no idea ... words cannot describe ... I had no idea ..."" Again, tears. As she emotes the words, I found myself thinking to myself, ""Yes, Jodie ... such a beautiful performance ... such a beautiful actor. You could have only done this by digging deep into the essence of your soul. To pull that out... from the depths of your core ... you must be so beautiful too ... I had no idea. No idea.""I must add here that I'm from Los Angeles, in the entertainment industry and I'm jaded. I know several celebrities. These are not the words of a some gushing fan. This is not fawning. This is simply respect and admiration for a truly brilliant talent. Look again at those scenes and her acting -- and judge for yourself. I only wish I was a high-enough ranking mogul to cast her in the romance film I just wrote. What luck any writer or director or producer must feel.",,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the best pure science-fiction films !!!!,"Contact is a 1997 American science fiction drama film directed by Robert Zemeckis. It is a film adaptation of Carl Sagan's 1985 novel of the same name; Sagan and his wife Ann Druyan wrote the story outline for the film.She's known it since she was a young girl, when she would magically connect with distant voices on her father's shortwave radio. She's known it since college, when she chose the search for intelligent extraterrestrial messages as her discipline. She's known it since she bargained for just hours a week of satellite time to sweep the heavens for evidence.

A singularly poignant statement that's still valid,"While you outgrow other movies and novels, I must say this still affects me like it did after I finished Uni.Human frailty, compassion, science, atheism, and faith in a beautiful statement that still speaks clearly, all in a not so much fiction as science vision that may very well become an experience of ours.Novelists and movie makers may make an impact - but only a few have something to say about what it is to be a human. Carl Sagan had both, leaving an undeniably great legacy, and this is a wonderful piece of that legacy.I recommend this movie to every citizen of Earth, of any age. It's interesting, witty, entertaining, emotional, and still looks very good indeed.

Taken deep into infinity and the limits of imagination,"After an amazing opening sequence, I found the film intially slow. But gradually I become drawn in, my jaw dropping, as the full message in the transmission from Vega was unravelled. From then on, I was absolutely glued to the screen, as if it was all really happening! Jodie Foster as astronomer Arroway delivers an exceptional performance - especially in the space journey sequences. These elevated me to rarely reached heights of movie experience: so frightening yet so wonderful. This is one of those films that has changed me, in some way stretched my conception of what is possible, what is beautiful, in existence.Jodie Foster's separate soundtrack of narration throughout the film adds another dimension, made me feel of getting to know her in some slight way.A really superb 'serious' sci-fi film, although the ending was, for me, suddenly rather obvious and disappointing.",,Anonymous,Mystery
The only truly universal language is mathematics!,"I remember the book being so well written and such a great story, but... with a slightly disappointing ending. I can imagine Carl Sagan thinking up the story and how it develops, and then wondering... ""How the heck am I going to end this"".Turning the book into a movie was a great effort and they have captured all the drama and issues and done such a great job on the writing and production parts. The ending is still a bit disappointing, but I can cope with that. The conflict between science and religious stupidity is just so ""American"", and it seems that nothing much has changed in the years that followed.I am particularly impressed with the Clinton sections, (even though the movie is set in 1988 and he wasn't Pres then). It shows just what can be done at the Weta workshops, they have taken archive footage, got someone to imitate the voice, then digitally morphed the mouth to get it all synchronised. A great job. I would guess that even Bill is happy with the result.The fact that my own view is that SETI is a waste of time doesn't alter my view of the movie. Other worlds? OK, possible, probable even, but it is not just intelligent life we want to know about, after all, the dinosaurs had some intelligence, so did Abraham, and Mozart, and Shakespeare, Edison et al. It is advanced intelligence we want, with radio telescopes and transmitters. We have had radio telescopes since about 1950, so that means that what I call the ""window of opportunity"", is only open about one millionth of its range, or even less, depending on how far back you want to go to say there was ""intelligent life"" present. Would anyone really go looking for something with their eyes open just a millionth?But next week... there might be an amazing announcement. Here's hoping!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Visually adventurous and theoretically interesting, Contact succeeds ala Indiana Jones in adventure and truth seeking yet fails every time that Matthew McConaughey smirks for the camera as casting clearly opted for box office over suspicion of disbelief.

excellent,"Have you read the book ""Contact""? Then you'll like the movie though it is different from the book. Characters and places were changed during the making of the screenplay and the movie but the story stayed the same: mankind is tiny in the universe but unique. One of Robert Zemeckis' best movies. Jodie Foster is great as Dr Arroway, Tom Skerritt plays an arrogant ""enemy"" perfectly. What happened to this movie in 1997? After creating Forrest Gump, Bob Zemeckis started to make ""Contact"" but this movie got lost in time (""like tears in rain"" - says the Replicant in Blade Runner). The answer is: Titanic. In 1997 James Cameron No. 1 hit motion picture flushed away anything else on the silver screen. Would people remember better of ""Contant"" if it appears in another year? Probably yes, because Contact is the best ""close encounter""-movie since Spielberg's Close Encounters Of The Third Kind. Watch it again - you'll see.

Beautiful!,"""Contact"" centers on Ellie Arroway,a child prodigy & then a brilliant physicist.She has a single-minded devotion to only one question.Are we alone? Or is the universe just an ""awful waste of space""? These questions though are not well received by the scientific community,at large.Most notably,the influential & resourceful Dr. Drumlin.This leads to the practical vs. pure science confrontation.Ellie though does find some like-minded people to help her in her pursuit.She is a living body of passion.She eats & breathes only to get back to picking up just any concrete evidence about extra-terrestrials.Amidst all this,the movie also manages to juxtapose some very large questions.The faith vs. science debate rages on with the character of Joss Palmer.He is a ""man of faith"",a Christian who also seems to know some science.His ideas are intersting & fit in quiet well in the movie.Ellie's run-in into Dr. Drumlin again,leads to the idealism vs. practicality debate.Do we want to hear what the other person is saying or just what we want to hear? The movie many such observations about humans & it's partially cynical that way.I absolutely loved how they handled the part after the ""big discovery"" is made public.The reactions of various sections of society hit really close to home.The movie constantly teases the belief aspect of our actions.Bring it to a head in the climax.Robert Zemeckis seems to be the high priest of Sci-fi movies.His works are taut,well-directed & very clearly focused.""Contact""'s special effects hold up well even today.Ellie's ""contact"" is an exhilarating scene.The machine and it's interiors are excellent set pieces.Jodie Foster is absolutely brilliant here.Her subtle reactions to the events around her totally sell her character & make us invested in her arc.Jodie carries the movie effortlessly.The movie is not without it's faults though.There are some scenes that felt hammy.Still,all's well that ends well.And end well it did.It was surprising to read that the critic reviews were so mixed..may I say that they should've sent a poet instead.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Brilliant movie,"I remember I saw this movie when I was little and I liked it a lot. However, now I was convinced the reason I had liked it so much was the excitement and curiosity it had stirred in me while watching it, and I didn't expect it to be so meaningful as I discovered it to be when re- watching it now, after approx. 12 years since I saw it.This movie is building up on existential questions we all have asked ourselves at one point or another in our lives: Are we alone in this Universe? Is there a God? What is the purpose of our life? etc). As the movie progresses, the feeling of getting closer to answering those questions is getting stronger and stronger, until it reaches it's climax: the part where you'll find yourself just observing, full of curiosity and excitement. The ending has its own unique way of answering those questions.Given the fact that it tackles such controversial, hard, essential questions and problems, one would expect this movie to collapse in an annoying unsatisfying feeling at the end.

Carl Sagan's Late Life Capitulation After Misleading so Many,"A pretty good mainstream blockbuster that is sort of a dumbed down, thinking man's, philosophical, science-fiction story of (first) Contact with ex-terrestrials. It is Carl Sagan's penance for misleading so many people. In the end he tried to make amends concerning his weak kneed ""scientific"" explanation that there has been no visitation because there is no physical proof, and they couldn't get here from there.You see, early in his career he ""dared"" to postulate that maybe this UFO thing needs some serious scientific study. But caving to peer pressure he soon learned that if he was going to be taken as a serious scientist, that open minded view was taboo and his career would find itself in a black hole.He was a dedicated debunker and intellectual fraud, and late in life he made a feeble attempt to ponder, at least the possibility, that well, maybe just maybe there might be something to this thing after all. Unlike his colleague J. Allen Hynek who devoted his life to uncovering the truth, Sagan took the safe path of least resistance and became a NASA and Academic hack.The movie is entertaining if not deep, although it pretends to be. But with such a mediocre Director it cannot be anything but a popcorn delivery system. That's OK, but one wishes for a little more intellect and a lot more creativity when such a subject is approached.By the way if anyone doubts that the Government, and religious and scientific leaders for that matter, with its control the populace policies would handle this in any other way, just search for ""The Brooking's Report"" on ET contact and discoveries. It basically stated that if this fact were made public there would be economic and religious collapse and world wide anarchy. Carl Sagan ""believed"" this until it was safe not to, shame on you ""Dr."" Sagan.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A classic serious sci-fi,"In 2006, more Americans would vote for a black than an atheist for presidency. Nothing strange in that. In 2006, with the on-going Iraq war and the massive tensions between Western and Islamic values, more Americans would vote for a Muslim than an atheist. Now THAT is alarming.I'm not making a statement against Muslims here. I'm just shocked that, in spite of the Islamophobia, in spite of the radical fundamentalists in (nuclear?) Iran, in spite of the Muslims holding the no. 1 spot as Villains in movies, news and culture, Americans still think atheists are more untrustworthy.This is one of Contact's points. Without spoiling anything, it's safe to say that Jodie Foster's character is held back thanks to her (non)-belief. Instead, the good stuff goes to the believer, and in a spot of irony, it's also lost thanks to a believer. When I first saw Contact, I didn't find it very realistic that all the religious people would be more content with choosing a contending religion instead of a neutral part, but the numbers above stumps me.All politics aside, Contact is a great movie. The first scene sets the scope perfectly and beautifully. Some scenes are very, very tense, thankfully avoiding the Hollywood Happy Music and instead going for a subtle, dramatic and threatening score.This and Silence of the Lambs will always be the two best Jodie Foster movies. Even though she is a great actress, I can't believe she will ever top this. She is nicely balanced by Matthew McConaughey, who, coincidentally, is a man of faith. Jake Busey plays a truly unsettling character, Joseph, who shows the greatest sides of blind faith. We even get to see some of William Fichtner, which I always consider a bonus in a movie.The plot is grand, to say the least. Carl Sagan always was a man of visions and even though I have not read the book, I can feel the scope and scale of it is very Sagan. Some people mean that Sagan's strong anti-religious stance in the book is diluted in the movie, which may or may not be true. Personally, I think a movie that wants to open a dialog is worth more than one dismissing the other idea all together.When all's said and done, Contact is one of the greatest science-fiction movies ever made, in the genre's purest form. People who dislike Star Wars, Star Trek, Alien and the like, should not worry; Contact is thoughtful and more about humanity than anything else. It's rating here at IMDb, an American site, reinforces the aforementioned figures. Had it been the same movie with a pro-religious message, I think this would have been high up in the top 250, and I hope that one day it will be.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Too bad,"Disclaimer: I am a fan of Carl Sagan and a former physics student... Furthermore, I will be commenting on the conclusion, so if you have neither read nor seen this work, please disregard the rest.Having just received ""Contact"" as a christmas present, I feel compelled to comment on it. I have seen it many times before, though not as many as I have read it, and hence my rather bad review (I had to own it, since I am compiling a ""Complete Jodie Foster"" collection).I think, that it is a movie that one has to see, but to grasp the real point, one has to see it, and then read and understand!To do the movie justice, I am obliged to state, that the acting from Jodie Foster and a few of the other lead actors had nothing to do with my bad feelings about this movie. The acting is great, but the adaptation for the silver screen is below ordinary sub-standard!One can always comment on the simplification of the plot, when a book is being filmed, but in this case, it would seem, that the point of the book is the opposite of that of the film. In both, Dr. Arroway is the lead character, but I had the distinct feeling, that while the book is a way of telling other scientists, being or in spe, to consider their believes once more, with the shadow of ""religious faith"" influencing the line of thought, this movie seems to me to be nothing more than a shallow action drama, corroborating the thought, that ""scientists may provide the means of our way of life, but they are wrong, and should be cast into the fires of eternal damnation""!!! (It isn't that bad, but well nigh).All things considered, it is another mainstream Hollywood movie, that tells another story than the book upon which it is based. It happens so often, that I seldom comment upon it, but since this particular movie has neglected well nigh all the major points of the book, I am loath to let my voice be heard.However, if you are just a sucker for a good story, and haven't the time to read, I can still recommend it, since the acting is quite ok.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Contact deals with so many issues and does it well: long-distance space travel, near-future science, religion, creation and how modern politics interplay with each of these. The astronaut selection committee's deliberations were relevant to any time period, especially when it came to the question of ""Who should represent Earth to the aliens?""

After so many years, the feeling is totally different from the 'first impression'.This movie was not about scientist and their discovery. It is about faith. People may get different result from the movie though. But, to take science as 'fact' is a big faith as well.The movie borrowed the shell of a science movie up until 3/4 of the length. In the last part, when we couldn't show what we 'feel' and 'see', others would have to take it by faith.This movie is not a pure faith movie, in that it still gives the loop hole that something left in proving the unproved jounery.Anyhow, this is a good movie that let people to think and feel.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

It is truly beautiful to get at least a fraction of 'time' - in our very rapid pace of life, these days - opportunity to use our vision and imagination how could our very best 'nature' looks like and what truly is important or could, or should be important to use our energy ecological.Everyone who helped and contribute such a great work, in such a movies like this one (thanks to very Carl Sagan - God blessed you for sure), with very open-hearted and amazingly genuine acting in it (especially two of them touched me, like already dozens of times before - hint: 'love' - in my opinion), I would like to thank you all and I mean it. It made my day to the fullest.Rate: 2=0 or 0=1 (2+3=5??)I think I should just saysimply 10/10 -otherwise I might be seem as being too delusional or schizophrenic for some people (mybe I am, who knows), nevertheless, have a nice day all of you, I think we are living in very precious 'the present' world, only our mind messes it up with our perception most of the time as a result of being irresponsible to ourselves and our beautiful Nature of 'Universe'.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The truth is within ourselves,"Robert Zemeckis strikes again, with a beautifully done SF story, an impressive drama about the quest for truth, for revealing huge misteries and for the sacrifices we're willing to do to accomplish our dreams.Ellie Arroway is a talented scientist, who searched all her life the proof of the existence of extraterestrial life forms. She has to fight not only with the difficulty of her job but also with the funders, the ones that pay for her research and who think that she is wasting her time and her talent on something that cannot be proven. One day Ellie picks up an audio signal, who proves not to be from Earth, but from a star named Vega. From this point starts the quest for knowledge, an impressive tale that will keep you watching until the end, although its pretty long runtime (more than 2 1/2 hours).Jodie Foster is brilliant as Ellie, she manages a great performance, alongside Matthew Mc Connaghuey and an also surprisingly good Tom Skeritt.Zemeckis shows the whole story with an extra touch of feeling, and during the film you get connected with the characters, you get to care about them or you get to hate them. But there are no ""bad guys"", no character to totally hate. Each one has good points and does good deeds. But they also screw up from time to time.This film is very good so i recommend it to everyone - you won't feel sorry. Vote : 8.5 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good intelligent sci-fi from the modern age of sci-fi films,"I've only seen this film a couple of times and have never seen it on the big screen which would surely do it justice but it is interesting that despite it's big budget and huge cast of special, visual and sound effects personnel it isn't really a big special effects type film. It least it doesn't depend on the special effects to carry the story. There is a story here. Based on the novel by Carl Sagan who consulted on the film up until the time of his death, this screenplay is wonderfully drafted by James V. Hart and Michael Goldberg. Jodie Foster is a radio astronomer who learned to love the mystery of space through the hope and wonderment that she shared with her father in listening to ham radio when she was a little girl. In her research she makes contact with intelligent life from the far reaches of space that give her coded instructions on how to build a device to traverse time and space to visit their world. A project so expensive that only a government or someone extremely wealthy from the private sector could fund. Joining Foster in the cast are Tom Skerrit, Matthew McConaughey, James Woods, John Hurt, Angela Basset and Rob Lowe. Robert Zemeckis who has had a diverse and successful career with such films as the Back to the Future series, Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Romancing the Stone and the Polar Express directs. Zemeckis certainly knows how to handle a big budget production and gets the most from his producers dollars. Several veterans of Zemeckis films including cinematographer's Don Burgess and Editor Arthur Schmidt are on board this project. There is a lot going on in this movie and the weaving of footage of real life characters throughout this film takes away from some of the story itself but this is a good sci-fi film and I would give it an 8.5 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A good movie,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""Contact"".  There aren't a lot of movies I watch more than once, but ""Contact"" is one of them.I've read some pretty negative comments on here about this movie.  You would have thought it was the worst movie ever made, based on those comments. Fortunately, the voting gives you a better picture of it (nearly 2 out of 3 people give it an 8 or higher).",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Frustrating and unfulfilling,"I have seen Contact twice -- once in the theater, and once on cable last night.  The elapsed year has not been kind to the film.  What I was willing to overlook then (in the name of ""enjoying the ride"") seems far more grating on a second viewing.This film has huge potential (even if derivative of too many older films to name).  It falls short except in certain well-done areas, such as the opening and Ellie's journey.  The damage is done by convenient pacing and slick Hollywoodisms that were tired when Spielberg invented them twenty years ago.Very few films can get away with Zemeckis' brand of manipulative self-importance.  Contact takes itself far too seriously to overlook its embarrassingly blatant shortcomings (Forrest Gump got away with them more successfully).  Spoofs like Austin Powers get plenty of slack from me.  Not this film.One funny note -- Palmer Joss' never-ending sudden appearances out of nowhere, all over the planet at a moment's notice, reminded me of someone, but it took awhile to place him...Dungeonmaster, from the old Dungeons & Dragons cartoon (1983).  Hilarious.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Wonderful film with a weak ending,"Often it helps to let some time pass before truly assessing a film (or any work of art, for that matter). I viewed ""Contact"" again recently after 7 years, and was both impressed (as I was before) but more frustrated this time. The film does a great job raising issues regarding extraterrestrial contact, all enveloped within a very engrossing story. But the ending left me cold. Ellie had been set up to be a strong, articulate, bright scientist -- clearly vastly superior to the Tom Skerritt character. Yet after her interstellar journey, she's not only mercilessly grilled by a huge Congressional committee (the James Woods character was way over the top) but reacts like a spoiled schoolgirl. (""What? Are you saying you don't believe me?!""). I would have expected a much different assessment of her experience than that from the government, and a much more articulate defense from her. Nevertheless, ""Contact"" is an extremely well-made, thought-provoking film.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Intelligent movie!,"where James Woods is, got to be good. He is not looking, but he is unique. I believe he is the only actor in Hoolywood who really reads the screenplay. He really chose the script where he is going to play. Some actors always play the same similar rules... but actually they don't fit there.My big ten points for this movie! This movie needs brain to watch it. The only thing I din like it (I am engineer) is: schematics for construction of that ship. Radio waves, why should aliens use radio wave? Codes, 3-dimensional, etc.. are stories for a kids...(this line i have extra add here: about the religious in this movie. i have notice half of you talks about it. Yes, u can simply say religion has nothing to the with it, and is doll. but it makes this movie more longer, and more participating)Best,D",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
And the Stars Go With You...,"This film depicts one of the most fascinating human searches.Fortunately, instead of focusing only on a scientific point of view, also provides a spiritual dimension, which is essential to be meaningful and depth.Carl Sagan firmly believed in life on other planets, and this fact is well portrayed in the character played by Jodie Foster. His tenacity, motivation and fascination with outer space, bore fruit. The topic: ""fight for a dream"" appears perfectly reflected here.This is a story in which science, beliefs, relationships, challenges, are interspersed.Science and spirituality had always been separated as two different or opposite worlds.With quantum physics, their paths have had no choice but to cross, and finally have agreed. Life and (mostly) death, are viewed from another angle. Although, certainly, there are still many things to explain.8,5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

True Science Fiction again at last,"If you feed on junk for long enough, you will get used to it.  Eventually you will get hooked on it.The recent Science fiction releases from Hollywood have been intensely disappointing for real sci-fi buffs but have at the same time been huge box office hits.  I enjoyed The Matrix and Independence day from an entertainment point of view, but as far as sci-fi goes these movies were thought provoking for the brain-dead only.Contact is boring only if you are entertained by non-stop special effects, slo-mo and stop action shots, lasers, phasers, warp drives, shields and planet pulping torpedos, weird ugly aliens, 'end of the world', 'alien take-over' and other cliche'd scenarios, gargantuan spaceships, robots, androids, humanoids, artificial intelligence graphically produced for those with a seemingly definite lack of intelligence and imagination.Contact provides the most likely scenario of a contact with an alien civilisation.  Via radio telescopes, unfortunately that does not leave much room for graphic depiction.  But yet it is handled in a thought provoking way whether you agree with the way the situation unfolds or not.Special effects were shown only when needed and in a controlled way. Ellies journey and the simulated blue watered beach set against a star filled sky was simply beautiful.  I for one wish that there was such a place in reality.  And by the way for those of you who as usual switched your brains off during the movie, that is not an alien appearing as Ellies father, it is a simulation.I am also amazed by the increasing number of American movie goers who find any thought provoking movie 'boring', and any movie hodge-podged and loaded with effects 'mind blowing and one of the best movies of all times'.  A sad indication of the 'Jerry Springer' mindedness of Americans today.For me 'Contact' is a science fiction classic.  An excellent combination of the factual, and the imaginative.  It has something for everyone whether you are an Aetheist, a Scientist, a Skeptic, a Religious person, a combination or none of the above.  It puts us, our planet, and our point in time into perspective. 'This is the way its been done for billions of years', Ellie is told.  Makes you feel pretty humble when you realise that not only you, but the entire history of our planet has been in around for an insignificant period of time compared to the eons that our universe has been around.It certainly made me think how far into space the broadcast of the Berlin Olympics has reached so far.  It also scares me to think that one day aliens may pick up broadcasts of the 'Jerry Springer Show'.Better than the book, Contact gets 9/10.",,Anonymous,Mystery
How can you not love this film,"Jody Foster is a treat as Ellie Arroway in this fantastic film based on the book by the late Carl Sagan. It was a completely different twist on the ""is there life in outer space"" theme and was very well presented. With a number one supporting cast, including Tom Skerrit, James Woods, Matthew McConaughay and John Hurt, it has to be good. I enjoyed this feature more than ""Independence Day,"" ""Armageddon"" or ""Deep Impact"" all of which I deem to be excellent films. Is there intelligent life in outer space? Who knows. If there is why would they ever wish to contact us? The scope of the film is magnificent and it also addresses the philosophical and religious questions that must be asked if discoveries of this kind were ever come to light. I would avidly love to see a sequel to this film. Two thumbs up.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Make your personal contact NOW!,"ContactDIRECTION % Nice touches throughout with the direction skill increasing as the movie progresses.ACTING t% Not Jodie Foster strongest role, but good enough to get the central themes across.EDITING/SPECIAL EFFECTS % Was that really President Clinton? Or showmanship editing from previous braodcast? Nevertherless other aspects including the special effect puts the marks up.PLOT % The search for life on other planets with some of the problems it would cause if they found it. One of the problems was this movie is that it assumes that different religions and faiths would probably act the same way (would they really!?) It brings up the question how should different faiths relate to each other in an increasing secular and competitive world? However the question of understanding faith will leave the unspiritual with questions in their minds, as it did to a few of my unchristian friends who saw the movie!STRONG WORDS AND VIOLENCE ETC g% Some in a few places, but not enough to distract from the overall message directly..MUSIC 4% Not the most noticably thing in the movie.SOUND q% High technology used to create beeps and other sound.HOOKABILITY t% Slow build up leads to........LASTABILITY '%......the what will happen next stage?OVERALL % If this movie just had that little bit extra it would have achieved the 90% mark or over.

Across the universe,"Foster went across the universe to find her dead father again and talk with him in a simulation. The picture from Hitler is the first sign for life on an other planet.

Wonderful movie...,"This movie is just breathtaking... ""Contact"" is a great sci-fi movie which is extremely underrated by the majority of public. People are still more into more action flooding unintelligent movies (such as ""Independence Day"", ""Armageddon"", etc.) than truly wonderful movies like ""Contact"". My all-time favorite actress Jodie Foster was amazing again here. I'm desperately looking for masterpieces like ""Contact"" in future.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Though not as good as the novel, ""Contact"" makes a great FILM.","Anyone who has lambasted the film has forgotten the BASIC FUNCTION of any movie:  to engage the audience emotionally.  Therefore, using Ellie's loss of her dad as a PARTIAL motivation for her search for extra-terrestrial life is valid, necessary, appropriate, and emotional.  Humans are emotional creatures.  If Zemeckis wanted to make ""Contact"" cold and without heart, then certainly he would have been faithful to every iota of the book.  But this is Hollywood, and to make a movie, you have to tell an accessible story.  And let's compare ""Contact"" to any other movie of 1997.  How many other movies actually do provoke ANY intellectual thought?  ""Contact,"" though not perfect, provided much food for discussion long after its audiences left the theatre.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
