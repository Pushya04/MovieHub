Patriotic,"I'm very surprised at the lower ratings here. This is a successful example of a movie which balances having fictional characters/situations take place in a historical setting while still maintaining some accuracy. Aside from that, the acting is solid and the effects and quality for a movie made in 2000 are top notch.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Heroes and Villains,"""The Patriot"", the story of an American farmer who fights in the War of Independence, is sometimes used, together with ""Braveheart"", as evidence of a supposed anti-British prejudice on the part of Mel Gibson. This is perhaps unfair to Gibson, who has gone on record as supporting the ties between Australia and the British monarchy (hardly the stance of a Brit-hating bigot). Although ""Braveheart"", which he produced and directed, was very much Gibson's own pet project, he was neither the producer, director or scriptwriter of ""The Patriot"". Indeed, he was not even first choice to play the lead. The producers originally wanted Harrison Ford who turned the part down, reportedly because he felt that the script turned the American Revolution into the story of one man's quest for revenge.Because of its anti-British stance, the film was badly received in Britain. One newspaper accused it of blackening the character of the British officer Banastre Tarleton who served as the inspiration for the villainous Colonel Tavington. One commentator went so far as to say that it was the sort of film that the Nazis might have made about the American Revolution had they won World War II. Unlike some of my fellow-countrymen, I was not too worried about this aspect of the film. The total death toll in the American War of Independence was remarkably low, not only by modern standards but even by the standards of other wars of this era, such as the Napoleonic War. Nevertheless, in every war ever fought there have been crimes on both sides, and the War of Independence was no exception. (The rebels could be as ruthless as the British, but none of their atrocities are shown in this film). Some of the deeds attributed to Tavington may be fictitious, such as the church-burning scene, but in real life Tarleton had a well-deserved reputation for brutality, and was not only loathed by the American colonists but also distrusted by his own side. In the film the British commander Lord Cornwallis is shown as outwardly gentlemanly and honourable, but prepared secretly to countenance Tavington's methods. In reality, Cornwallis wanted to have Tarleton court-martialled; Tarleton was only saved by his influential connections.I did, however, have some reservations about the way these events were portrayed. It was originally intended to make the film about Francis Marion, a real-life figure. Unfortunately Marion, although undoubtedly courageous and a skilled guerrilla leader, was also a slave-owner (as any landowner of substance in 1770s South Carolina would have been) and was therefore deemed unworthy to be the hero of a modern blockbuster (even though a TV series about him was made in the fifties). His exploits, therefore, are credited to a fictitious ""Benjamin Martin"". The slavery issue could have been avoided by moving the action to, say, New England, but instead the film gives us a wholly unrealistic picture of race relations in the period. The black workers on Martin's land are all free men, and black and white live together in harmony, with black soldiers willingly fighting alongside whites in the Continental Army. This sort of dishonest, idealised portrayal of slavery was at one time common in films like ""Gone with the Wind"", but I thought that it had died out with the growth of the Civil Rights movement.(Incidentally, a reason why so many Southerners supported the revolutionaries was that slavery had been declared illegal in Britain itself in 1771 and they feared that the British Parliament would eventually legislate to ban it in the colonies. Needless to say, there is no mention of this attitude in the film. In later life Tarleton became MP for Liverpool, and a vehement defender of slavery. In this, if in nothing else, he and Marion had something in common).My other reservation about the film's political stance is similar to Ford's. The film probably concentrated so heavily on British brutality because it is difficult to interest a modern audience, even an American audience, in the actual reasons why the war was fought. It is easy to make out an intellectual case for the principle of ""no taxation without representation"", which had been part of British constitutional thought since at least the Civil War in the 1640s. It is much less easy to justify the spilling of blood in defence of that principle, and Martin, scarred by his experiences in the French and Indian Wars, is originally shown as a pacifist, unwilling to fight or to support the Declaration of Independence which he believes will lead to war. His son Gabriel, however, joins the Continental Army, but is wrongly accused of being a spy and threatened with execution. Tavington, believing Martin to be a rebel sympathiser, burns down his home and murders another son, Thomas. Martin is forced to take up arms to defend his family and then forms a guerrilla band which he leads against the British. Despite the title of the film, however, Martin is not really motivated by patriotism; he seems less a patriot than a pacifist who has abandoned his principles in order to seek revenge.The film is attractively photographed, although I felt that it sometimes showed a sanitised, prettified version of eighteenth-century life. In some ways it reminded me of ""The Last Samurai"", another visually attractive epic flawed by a dishonest approach to history and by excessive length, although I would rate it slightly higher, largely because Gibson makes a more commanding and impressive epic hero than does Tom Cruise. From the viewpoint of anyone without patriotic preconceptions, it can be seen simply as an exciting (if overlong) adventure film- my wife, who is not British by birth, was cheering on Martin and booing Tavington. Nevertheless, its approach to history never gets beyond a simplified story of heroes and villains. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,History
Liked it - see below,"Just watched this movie for about the 20th time (I have it on TiVo) and for the life of me I cannot find the disdain many who have written here have commented on. Last I heard, this was FICTION - NOT a documentary; Ken Burns did not produce not write nor direct nor narrate this piece - Roland Emmerich, a man known for action FICTION did. Yes the depiction of the Revolutionary War was NOT 100% accurate but was never intended to be; just a drama set against the background of a war and it was refreshing to see the war in the background, whereupon American blood is spilled on American soil, was the Revolutionary War and not another Civil War piece; indeed, the Civil War has been played so many times in films over the past quarter century it was just refreshing to see a different war....Being somewhat of a military historian I will say that the depiction of soldiers going musket to musket in the open field was indeed accurate; many may find it interesting to know that according to the gentlemanly practices of King George's army, both sides would also recess for tea at noon every day and resume the fighting afterwards - guerrilla warfare was not popular during the day which is why Gibson's militia unit was so overtly successful early on. That being said, the comments about the accuracy with the muskets are fairly accurate but I will say that I only see straight barrel musket rifles - none of the bell shape tipped muskets; the longer you keep a projectile on a straight course the more accuracy at longer ranges despite the lack of rifling grooves in the barrels (I spent time on Rifle Teams for 5 years). The prime inaccuracy I noted was when Tavington shot the rider (running away on horseback) in the back with a musket pistol at probably 40 yards or more - so unlikely, it tarnished the whole scene.My favorite person - Billings; Leon Rippey's cynical, almost giggly snickering laugh completely stole the every scene where it was used and he is a long term favorite actor of mine; Jason Isaacs absolutely best screen villain of this movie (and perhaps in top 10 screen villains of all time).I guess it boils down to ""different strokes for different folks"" we all have our opinions on this and I've aired mine.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Well worth seeing - and accurate on many fronts,"The Patriot is NOT a documentary. It didn't pretend to be, and wasn't. Loosely based upon Francis Marion (the ""Swamp Fox""), it only touched on Marion's impact on the Revolution in South Carolina. If anything, it was downplayed. For instance, in real life, he had over 150 men in his guerrilla band. The movie portrayed him as having far fewer. As a documentary, it fails on this and many other points. As a movie, it is a tremendous success.As far as visuals, they were stunning. The wide-open vistas and battle scenes were breath-taking and beautifully filmed. Yes, it was violent, but that lent a realism to the film that most other films about this era lack. The look and feel of this period was portrayed well.The acting was superb. I won't give anything away, but this did NOT (arguably) have either an entirely ""Hollywood"" plot – people, including civilians, DIE, as they do in war – or much of a ""Hollywood"" ending, despite a relatively happy one. That was impressive, and made the film genuine, exciting and at times, shocking. Plot points such as Benjamin Martin's youngest daughter's feelings about her daddy, and the romance between his son and a young girl were touching, and even emotional.I found some things complain about. Crisp, clean, brand-new Colonial American flags suddenly appear after, and during, the final battle. In reality they would have been rags by then – or at least not so clean. One bad bit of dialogue: Benjamin Martin is on the beach with his sister-in- law, and he asks if he can sit down. Her reply, ""It's a free country – or will be soon,"" was a 20th century throw-away line dressed up with a 1780 caveat, and I cringed at it.The film was historically accurate in many respects. The formal way of speaking, plus the family-above-all, loyalty-to-The-Cause attitudes expressed throughout, were genuine, even though both are out of favor today. Children using weapons, and going off to fight on a moment's notice, was not an uncommon story, and supposedly happened in a branch of my own family. Relationships like Martin's and his wife's sister did occur, often out of necessity. I was surprised to read afterwards that the battle tactics of the last scene occurred, almost exactly as shown, at the Battle of Cowpens, including fierce hand-to-hand combat. Colonel Banastre Tarleton – the basis for the movie's character William Tavington – was indeed seen as a war criminal by American colonists at the time, and the real Tarleton even had a horse shot out from under him!But was it biased? Sure it was. Roughly a third of the American colonists were Loyalists, another third were ""rebels"", and another third were undecided. It would have made the story more complete and complex to portray this (or the time Tarleton mistakenly slaughtered some of those very Loyalists!) But I've read a poem online (""Ode to Valour"") dedicated to Col. Banastre Tarleton's ""heroic exploits"" that would shame modern-day propagandists.I think we all accept that not every British officer of this era was a monster. In fact, in the movie – as in real life - Cornwallis and other British officers were appalled that the ""Ghost""/Swamp Fox did not play by the rules of ""civilized warfare"", and chastised characters like Tavington who also breached them. The real Swamp Fox knew a bit about balance, however. After after the war, when the real Francis Marion served in the South Carolina Senate, he is said to have advocated a lenient policy toward the Loyalists. The real Tarleton survived the war, went home to write his memoirs, was seen as a hero, and was elected to Parliament. Maybe we need a sequel to cover all of these other aspects of the story. Until then, this one is a must- see.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Thoroughly entertaining,I have been a Mel Gibson fan since his very good Mad Max and his horrible Summer City. I loved this movie and it is in my top ten favorites of all time. Mel is very believable as Benjamin Martin who fights only after he looses one son to death and one son to the army. Heath Ledger plays Gabriel Martin who goes to fight for his country despite his father's protests. I know that not all of the facts are historically correct but this is a movie and did not claim to be a history lesson. The period is portrayed very well and the battle scenes are so well done that you almost feel you are there. This movie is very graphic in the battles and if you do not like the sight of blood and other realistic battle scenes then this might not be the movie for you. I watched the entire movie and did not realize the length. I was so engrossed in the plots.,10.0,Anonymous,History

"An epic and moving film with big name cast , emotion , violence , and impressive battles","Spectacular and breathtaking film about the American Independence War dealing with an enjoyable family and the tragic events happening along the way . Benjamin Martin : Mel Gibson is a conscientious objector due to previous wars he suffered and he is nowadays a widower of seven children : Heath Ledger , Logan Lerman , Gregory Smith, Mika Boorem, Sky Bartusiak , Trevor Morgan ... He is a former guerrilla soldier who just wants to raise his family in peace . Unfortunately , local Redcoats as Col. Tavington : Jason Isaacs , underlings : Adam Baldwin , and commander-in-chief : Tom Wilkinson have other ideas . When Martin's idealistic soldier son Gabriel : Aussie Ledger is captured , daddy gets caught in action . What would you do if they destroyed your home , threatened your family . Where would you draw the line ? Before they were soldiers , they were family . Before they were legends , they were heroes . Before there was a nation , there was a fight for freedom . Some things are worth fighting for .Revolutionary War vengeance pic with thrills , noisy action , overwhelming fights and well-played . The main character and central axis of the movie results to be Benjamin Martin/Mel Gibson, magnificently performed , as a bloodied veteran of the French and Indian Wars , and a few years later a pacifist , but his pacifism owes as much to pragmatism as conviction to defend and care his several children . A violently idealist movie dealing with historical events about the Independence War , battles between Colonians and British army . Alongside the great Mel Gibson appears the early deceased Heath Ledger and a large cast of secondaries giving sensational performances , such as : Chris Cooper , Tom Wilkinson, Joely Richardson , Tcheky Karyo , Donald Logue , Adam Baldwin, Leon Rippy , Rene Auberjonois and special mention for Jason Issacs providing a really baddie role as sadistic colonel.Adding a rousing and attractive musical score from maestro John Williams, Steven Spielberg's regular. As well as colorful and brilliant cinematography from Caleb Deschanel. This overlong , bloody and melodramatic motion picture was compellingly produced -along with Dean Devlin- and directed by Roland Emmerich (The Day after tomorrow , Godzilla , Independence Day , Stargate , Universal Soldier , Moon 44 , Ghost Chase, Joey) .

"Here's Mel to give the Brits an inaccurate historical thrashing, again...","The Patriot is based around one Benjamin Martin, an ex-soldier, who now happily living as a family man finds himself thrust into conflict at the break of the American Revolution.He loves the Brits does Mel Gibson, ""Gallipoli"", ""Braveheart"" and here with ""The Patriot"", see the pattern anyone? As with the aforementioned ""Gallipoli"" and ""Braveheart"", certain liberties have also been taken with events in ""The Patriot"" so as to glossy up for the eager Hollywood contingent. It's not my want to scribble about the facts of Benjamin Martin (Re: Francis Marion), or William Wallace for that matter, information as such is but a mere click away on the world wide web.So casting aside the artistic licence factors, is ""The Patriot"" any good? Well nearly it is -- nearly. Gibson is fine, he shoulders the burden of the film with great gusto and no shortage of emotional depth. It's very easy to accept him as a staunch family man who transforms into a blood thirsty warrior. The problems, acting wise, lay away from Gibbo's central performance. Surrounded by caricature villains (though Jason Isaacs' Tavington is deliciously vile) and underwritten characters (Chris Cooper wasted and Joely Richardson is but a mere prop), Gibson has no choice but to hog the screen. So much so it ultimately turns into a one man star vehicle, which for a costume war epic isn't a great thing really.Roland Emmerich (""Independence Day"" and ""Godzilla"") directs and handles the battle sequences very well, there's lashings of blood as men line up to shoot and dismember one and other. While cannonball's whizz, bang and tear off body parts, it's grim, yet oddly rousing stuff. Not even the overtly flag waving and sloganeering on show can off set the impact of the well constructed battles. There is of course lots of tragedy to be found in the film, and these are some what surprisingly, tenderly handled by Emmerich, but mostly it's via an on song Gibson, who remains one of the few modern day male actors capable of believable grief. All of this is given a John Williams score that suitably flits between rousing and ethereal, and things are further boosted by the sumptuous photography from Caleb Deschanel.There should have been more thought given to the racial (slaves) aspects in the conflict, and this coupled with the bad errors of under developed characters hurts ""The Patriot"" as a filmic exercise, not so as to stop it being entertaining, but more to stop it being a one man show. But as it is, thanks in the main to Gibson, and in spite of the overtly evident faults, it's an above average drama. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,History
Not everyone has background knowledge,"Me, I'm not bothered - a piece of colourful escapist nonsense. A popcorn movie, as the producers say. As a Brit in his 50s, the substantial liberties taken with history don't keep me awake at night, because I realise they are simply dramatic licence.Then I find myself in ""discussion"" on a website - to do with popular music, nothing to do with film - with a young American gentleman, and a jocular remark suddenly sends him off on a tirade, the gist of which is that he hates the British because of the atrocities we committed during the War of Independence, and he knows this to be the case because he saw it for himself when he watched The Patriot.OK, so the lad is clearly a bit lacking in the Education Department, and has been even more substantially short-changed in the Common Sense Department, but that doesn't change the fact that he - and, presumably, a not inconsiderable number of others like him - have taken this pile of poo on board as fact.I don't know what the answer is. Better education? More responsible film-making? Cull the dimwits?

"Not as Bad as I Remember, but still has Issues","The Patriot is a film that I've always had mixed feelings about. After seeing it again recently, I think I have a more coherent idea of how I feel about this film.To sum this film up neatly, it is a retelling of the story we know in Braveheart, with some alterations and being slightly worse.From a historical standpoint, The Patriot is about as historically accurate as Braveheart - that meaning that it really isn't. By now, many have already meticulously picked apart its inaccuracies so I won't really dwell on it too much. But as a piece of popular cinema, I don't think this film's intention is to be historically accurate anyway.The Patriot is an impressive looking film, I believe. The action sequences are exciting to watch and the scale of the battles are appropriate enough where there aren't noticeable CGI people also partaking in the fight.Speaking of the CG effects, they are looking a bit dated now. Some of the computer generated blue screen backgrounds don't look very convincing, especially when they go to Charles Town at the beginning of the film. But since the shots don't dwell too much on them, it's not too bi a deal, I believe.The acting performances aren't bad at all. Mel Gibson found his niche after Braveheart and went with it and his performance here translates incredibly well. The actors that portray the various British officers in this film do put on a bit of a James Bond villain performance and it does get a little distracting, but there is some complexity in the writing at times that makes up for that in those moments.It's also to be noted that the soundtrack for this film is amazing. Of course, this is the work of John Williams and it goes extraordinarily well when paired with this film. It is the shining aspect of this film and I cannot compliment it enough. It has to be one of the more underrated works John Williams has done.Where this film ultimately loses me is when it comes to the issue of slavery. I understand this is among the myriad of other historical inaccuracies with this film, but it's this particular aspect of American history that really hurts it the most. The most obvious example of this is when the workers on Martin's farm say that they work his land but are not slaves. It is also framed in this film that the British army offering freedom to any slave who serves with them is a bad thing, but later when the American army announces something similar, suddenly it's righteous. This, of course, wasn't the case and it's very misleading. There's a scene in the film where Gabriel makes a promise that once the British are defeated, the old world will be pushed out and a new world can be built; one where all people are free. This is so obviously untrue but the film ignores it. As a result, it feels like the one slave character shown in the whole film is duped into serving with the continentals just to be enslaved again once the eventual government decides, through inaction, that slavery is necessary. I get images of the American Civil War in my mind every time I see that scene, and it's that scene that really hurts this film the most- but ironically enough, maybe the most accurate part of it...The Patriot is interesting. I feel it's a bit long. Granted, I'm just coming from seeing the extended cut but I do think this film could have gone without some things. Not horrible if you're looking for a fictional story that takes place in a real time in history. Just don't use it as an educational tool unless you're going to talk about the uniforms and clothing of that period.",6.0,Anonymous,History

"Entertaining, but ultimately unbalanced and unsatisfying.","I had fairly high hopes prior to watching this movie for the first time. I actually enjoy 'period' films, and American history is a particular favorite.So I was very disappointed with ""The Patriot"". I felt that the director simply overlaid a generic story onto the Revolutionary War theme, and did so in a very unbalanced, black and white manner. I don't want to restate the many views already expressed, so I'll just say that my main objection to this film, was the way it assumes the viewing public are all simpletons. For example, why was it necessary for the director to bludgeon us with his obvious bias against the British in this film? I mean, how many atrocities did he require Col.Tavington to commit before he ensured that everyone in the audience was baying for British blood? Come on Mr Emmerich, haven't you ever heard of subtlety?Apart from the black and white nature of the whole picture, there were far too many totally unrealistic scenes. Are we really to believe that Benjamin Martin and his two young boys could so easily despatch an entire company of British soldiers?What a shame that what could (and should have) been a balanced, stirring narrative on an important period of America's history, was ultimately reduced to such formulaic Hollywood fluff. I sincerely hope that another studio/director revisits the topic, and does it right. As always, I suppose it all comes down to making a film that will score big at the box office, versus making a film that will actually mean something long after the movie posters for it have been torn down. If you like American period films, give ""Dances with Wolves"" a go - it's far superior!6/10",6.0,Anonymous,History
Cartoon version of the Revolutionary war,"This film left me with fixed feelings. I will begin with the negative and end with the positive. What bothered me most about The Patriot are the carcicatured portrayals of the British. I know they are supposed to be 'the villains' but often their cruelty is over the top, especially Jason Isaac's character. Another annoyance is the presentation of the battle scenes. While they are spectacularly choreographed and filmed, it's absurd when characters (eg. Martin's family) are viewing them like a football game instead of ducking for cover. Despite these quibbles, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Mel is absolutely convincing as the alternatively grieving and raging patriot. I found some of the death scenes so moving I started crying. The supporting cast is also superb and took their direction perfectly. I also enjoyed the detail payed to the costumes, props, and hairstyles. The Patriot is NOT an accurate historical docudrama but it is a rousing and entertaining well above average summer movie. Recommended, 8/10.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Very Well Done,"As a fan of historical films, I really enjoyed the movie "" The Patriot"" starring Mel Gibson who skillfully portrays the role of an American colonial during the Revolutionary War. Actors like Gibson have a talent for making history come alive on screen and engaging the audience. The movie held my interest. It was never dull or slow. The sets were just great and I often felt like I was in the middle of a battlefield. I loved the flashes of color, cannons blazing, colonial flags waving, the columns of British soldiers dressed in their best and brightest uniforms and the array of women and children who were colorful parts of colonial America. All in all, this was well worth the watch and a real change from the usual long list of action packed, special effects films which are a bit overdone.",10.0,Anonymous,History
An entertaining movie but not a history lesson,"Brig. Gen. Francis Marion, the historical person that Mel Gibson's character is loosely based on was a true war hero and patriot.  The ones who are denigrating his legacy are mostly British `historians' and those who are too stupid or lazy to do their own research.Actually, Mel Gibson's Benjamin Martin is a composite of 3 historical characters:  one of course was Francis Marion the `Swamp Fox'; another was an illiterate backwoods general, Daniel Morgan, who encouraged the militia at the battle of Cowpens (final battle enacted in the movie) to stand their ground against the British; and the third was a cavalry officer, William Washington, who pursued Tarleton after Cowpens and fought him in hand-to-hand combat, which they both barely survived.Gen. Marion used tactics that the Brits termed `ungentlemanly' for warfare, but he got the job done, just as the Viet Cong did 200 years later against our own GI's.  Marion knew, because of his lack of manpower, equipment, and experienced soldiers, he couldn't take on the superior British forces using outmoded and quaint European-style warfare (in fact, this idiotic style of warfare continued up until WWI).  The movie depicts this very well.  So Gen. Marion wisely used the only tactics left to him  hit-and-run, which he learned from fighting the Cherokees during the French and Indian Wars.The movie's villainous Lt. Col. Tavington, who is also loosely based on Lt. Col. Banastre Tarleton, is not too far from the truth, though a little over the top.It was during the retreat of Waxhaws that Tarleton came to symbolize British cruelty in the Revolutionary War.  Tarleton was seen as a ""butcher"" when American forces under Col. Abraham Buford laid down their arms in an attempt to surrender yet the British continued their assault.  From then on, his reputation grew and `Tarleton's quarter', in effect, came to mean ""no quarter"".In the tradition of the day, after the surrender at Yorktown, American officers hosted the defeated Cornwallis and other British officers at their respective tables.  But no American invited Tarleton nor would any eat with him.  Tarleton asked if the omission was accidental, and he was told that, indeed it was not, because of his past atrocities.Tarleton lived a long life, condoning his use of total war  burning houses, destroying crops, the end justifying the means.  He also would never admit to any fault at Cowpens, saying he was `outnumbered' and received inadequate assistance from Cornwallis.  He wondered, ""how some unforeseen event"" could ""throw terror into the most disciplined soldiers"".I didn't go into this movie for a history lesson but to be entertained, and I was, but after reading some of the inaccurate and illiterate reviews, I found it necessary to give a `history lesson'!  The movie wasn't perfect  it was cloying and obvious at times, but I give it high marks for effort and for bringing to the screen an important part of American history that has received disparate treatment in movies, and I think Devlin & Emmerich can now be forgiven for Godzilla.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Distorted history of heroes and villains,"Everything about this movie seemed like something from Disney would make, despite the violence. And it would be forgivable if it was made by Disney, but it's not. There is just way too much Hollywood in this, yeah it's a patriotic movie and probably will make the audience proud to be American. This is a very distorted historical movie in order to make everything seem more entertaining, and isn't one of those films that should be shown in history classes. Mel Gibson seems to love these types of roles, but he really isn't a great actor and it really shows he is acting. This is film is basically black and white, where it shows heroes to be heroes and villains to be villains. Nothing about this film is riveting or gripping, sure some patriotic Americans enjoy this film for what it is. Nothing is stunning about this film, although the cinematography is decent.

A Travesty of History,"Let us be clear about this. The burning of the church is a lie. It did not take place. The film, not the church, is the atrocity. Let us also get a few things straight about the American Revolution. It was fought on these issues 1. The colonists refused to contribute to the cost of their own defence (and no, that is not a spelling mistake) from the French, which had been paid for in British money and the lives of her young men. 2. It was fought so that the colonists could break out from the colonies in the East and invade Indian territory which the British Crown - George III - has designated as Native Title. Jefferson is well-documented as have his eyes set on the West. 3 In the south it was fought to maintain slavery. Most blacks fought on the British side and for good reason. They had heard of the Case of Sommersett v Stewart in which Lord Mansfield, chief justice of the King's Bench had granted habeas corpus to James Sommersett who was a slave in Virginia and had been taken to England.

"The Happy to be a Slave, Slaves","This was a great movie from an action standpoint and Mel Gibsons performance was outstanding, however in the movie the main character was a slave holder or in the very least a and I can't say I would view an active slaveholder as a true Patriot. Unless the African American characters in this movie were freed Americans being paid good salaries to be house servants and field hands, which I doubt highly, this character was not a patriot of freedom but rather a patriot of the freedom to enslave and oppress others.Whoever wrote this movie must have anticipated some criticism about how the African Americans would be portrayed because in one part the British soldiers offered the slave freedom and the African American replied that they are not slaves but they are freedmen ""happily working the white mans property"" and happily helping him with no concern for themselves. To me that part was the single biggest insult to my intelligence as an African American because we at no time in history were happily working any white mans property without some level of resentment which this movie fails to portray.The movie patronizes and pacifies the African American community by portraying happy slaves and the typical token black ""saving the white man to prove your worth"" scenarios as their token attempt to include blacks but only in the contexts of yet still another form of servitude of having to save a white person in order to prove our worth. Frankly, I'm tired of the idea that we as African Americans are only worthy if we save and serve white people instead of each other. The movie basically treats African Americans as passive props in the fight for independence when modern history tells us that there were more than one black man fighting for freedom and slaves were far more involved than the happy passive clueless slaves and sharecropers that this movie portrays us as. I for one wish that the British had won the war because independence day for American was a death sentence for millions of my ancestors. The British owned slaves too as we know but I believe that the American form of slavery was much more harsh and inhumane. I'm a U. S. Veteran now but had I been alive then I would have fought for the British as they had provided freedom to slaves that fought. I would have preferred the uncertain future rather than fight on the side of a Hypocrisy/Democracy. As a person who has experienced racism I would most definitely have fought for the British. The movies shows a few blacks being shot by the British and leaves out the fact that the British freed many blacks for their service I guess in order to make it seem as if blacks and whites were fighting for the same things which we were not. White Americans were for their rights for racial superiority and freedom for themselves to exclude, enslave and create a permanent underclass of blacks.I'm sorry I was by no means impressed with the token black man character (not the actor himself) earning his worth by saving a white man. I do get the point of the white man that was racist being saved by a black man and then is attitude changes but I'm tired of us being brainwashed to save white people all the time.",7.0,Anonymous,History

"Almost BRAVEHEART, but a few small flaws.","THE PATRIOT is an excellent movie. It is an excellent example of how to do an epic action film, but it tries to be a sweeping action, romance, family, and to a lesser degree comedy epic. However, the PATRIOT doesn't quite deliver the romance portion very well, and truth be told, the portion of the film focusing on the family could have been better. But what do you expect from Roland Emmerich, whose best attempt at a story about a family was INDEPENDENCE DAY? Nevertheless, Emmerich did a good job on that aspect of the film, it just could have been better. This is by far Emmerich's best film, and a quite surprising turn-around after the God-awful GODZILLA.Also, THE PATRIOT, in my opinion, did not take advantage of the American Revolution to it's fullest. In the final segments of the film, we see a quickie detail of the end of the war, but this film makes the Revolutionary War seem as if it was completely centered around stopping the band of men led by Gibson's character, which is, in my opinion, a mistake in story direction. The patriotism could have been pumped up, and that would have done for THE PATRIOT what Wallace did for Scotland: given the audience a surreal sense of honor and pride to be an American. I saw this movie on the Fourth of July, and at no other time of year could this movie have made me feel more patriotic, yet it still didn't completely deliver. Another slight annoyance is with the name Gibson takes on: ""The Ghost"" which is to say the least, not a very original idea nor a very original name to give the character. As well, the final confrontation, while excellently shot and gripping, it a bit contrived and unoriginal, a fault that BRAVEHEART did not have to carry by any degree. My last gripe is with the female love interest that Gibson takes on. She is not very well established, and personally, seems a bit wrong for Gibson's character. The floundering relationship acts like a sharp kick to the gut, taking a potentially flawless movie like BRAVEHEART and making it a mere great movie. Still, the movie is excellent, and to be quite honest, the scene where Martin (Gibson) rescues his eldest son is the most intense and vivid scene I have ever watched in my entire movie-going experience. That counts for something, and so does this fine example of an epic film. *************************************************",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Despite it's being fiction, it is certainly good entertainment","Whenever I see a film that is supposed to have historical basis, I am always a bit surprised to find out how much people complain about historical inaccuracies.  I admit that I have done so in a few cases myself (Thin Red Line).  However, in this case, I feel I must point out a few things.All such films come with a disclaimer saying something to the effect that the characters portrayed aren't real and the story is just that, a story. For entertainment.  Martin and Tavington did not actually exist, they are merely characters, possibly based (as has been suggested) on actual historical figures.  I often wonder if such films as Treasure of the Sierra Madre, or Rio Grande, or just about any western flick was judged so harshly when it came out as we judge 'historical' pictures today?  Or any pirate film?  Zorro?  Any film with knights in it?  It seems to me that unless you are making a documentary, the historical accuracy doesn't truly matter in detail.  Certainly, I enjoy films better when they seem to be a reasonably accurate portrayal of a time (costumes, technologies), but I don't carp about whether some person existed.  Even if they did, I expect the film to be untrue so I can be entertained. For example, most wars are not constant fighting.  Certainly some battles went on for days at a time, but there is a lot of waiting and a lot of marching.  Yet most war films seem to be battle after battle after battle, with no real respite except for the wounded.  Not so. How about some facts?    Fact:  Americans fought against themselves during the war.  Many Americans served with the British forces.    Fact:  There were in fact many atrocities committed by the British forces, rapes, property burning, etc.  Don't believe me?  Check out the history of what happened to the original signers of the Declaration of Independence, their families and their properties.  That's actual history, not just entertainment history.  Of course, this wasn't only limited to the British forces.  According to Massachusetts history, the Revolutionary forces (not necessarily the armed forces even) were, um, not kind to people who sympathized with the British.  The tavern recruitment scene suggests this quite well.  Were churches actually burned with a town's population inside.  Maybe, maybe not, but it certainly was dramatic, wasn't it? Fact:  Literacy was not as common at that time as it is today.  Many people, especially the lower classes, and slaves could not read.Did Cornwallis have a pair of great danes that were 'captured' by the enemy? I doubt it, but possibly. Were slaves that served in either army freed after a certain term of service?  Again, I don't know.  (I am not even certain that slavery was allowed in Britain at the time.  Indentured servants, I think yes (though the difference is slight, I grant you), but actual slavery, hmm.  I'll have to check on that.)  The colonies typically did form their own militias for local use.  The americans did, as a general rule, fight using more guerilla tactics  (especially early on, the american forces were composed largely of more militia than regulars, see below for comments on militia), check the accounts of the battle of Concord, and what happened to the British forces as they withdrew.War is brutal and ugly.  People die.  Many of the soldiers don't want to be there.  Militia, being less well trained and thus disciplined, does have a tendency to fight very poorly in set piece battles (check current and past arguments for keeping a 'standing' 'professional' army).Ignoring the historical accuracies or lack thereof (and btw, Braveheart was not 100% accurate either, though the main characters , Wallace, Robert the Bruce, King Edward, did all exist, but again, I don't seem to recall people complaining so loudly about that)  I found Mel's character to be believable and well portrayed.  Yes, there were elements of Hollywood happiness in the film (the beach town, he workers attitudes, the romances) and Hollywood sadness' in the film (the massacre, the child's death), but it was very entertaining.  I found many of the battles to be very realistic (okay, pistols WERE NOT that accurate and never have been) and sufficiently entertaining for my needs.Overall, a very good film.  Hollywood, certainly, but entertaining.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Roland and Mel deliver,"I was expecting Gladiator to be Braveheart 2, but that title goes to The Patriot.  What this movie has above all other movies this summer is a script.  Robert Rodat, who penned Saving Private Ryan, paints this Revolutionary drama with wonderfully broad strokes, but does not forget the human aspect.  Mel Gibson shows his acting chops in a characer similar to Wallace, but far more complex.  However, it is Jason Isaacs that, in the spirit of Alan Rickman and Tim Roth, steals the show with his deliciously evil portrayal of Col. Tavington.  What separates this epic apart from the other summer movies is Rodat's wonderful ability to evoke several different emotions.  Rodat wonderfully establishes many bonds and then breaks them abruptly with the death and destruction of war.  Truly there is more suffering in this movie than I have seen in almost any, and it makes the payoff at the end (you were aware that we actually win the war right?) that much better.  Emmerich also is able to capture the essence of combat tactics of the day.  Be it the minute-man behind the bushes style, or the open field style Emmerich milks every dramatic possibility from these old style battle tactics.  All this combines to make a wonderful movie that should not be forgotten come Oscar time (especially Isaacs).",10.0,Anonymous,History

An Amazing Film,"""The Patriot"" may very well be labeled this year's ""Saving Private Ryan"". While the two films are strikingly different, they share the common theme of American patriotism and this country's stand on independence.  ""The Patriot"" gives an idea of the kind of hardships settlers faced in the war for our independence.The casting of ""The Patriot"" was brilliant!  Mel Gibson once again gives us a moving performance as Ben Martin, a passionate man that is trying desperately to keep his family together after the death of his wife. Perhaps one of the more surprisingly superb performances is that of Heath Ledger (10 Things I Hate about You) as Gabriel Martin, the stubborn oldest son of the Martin family.  These two stars lead the cast in teaching such lessons as what it means to be a patriot and a hero, the cost of freedom, and the value of family.""The Patriot"" is a well written story that is guaranteed to give you goosebumps.  After seeing this movie, Independence Day will take on a new meaning for everyone.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Watchable film, yet don't take its message to heart.","This is a very watchable and enjoyable film, don't get me wrong. I feel compelled to say however that you should not believe a lot of what it says. I don't know whether Mel Gibson hates the British, or more specifically the English, but you would be forgiven for thinking so. But neither this film or indeed Braveheart do anything to make one think differently.In wars bad things do happen, but the idea of honour and decency is something British officers are very much trained to practise. Even if a 'rebel' office was to commit vile act he would not have done so under the blessing of his commander.Now as an Englishman I look at American films and wonder why many of the 'bad guys' have British accents. Perhaps an American will explain this to me one day. There is also something very wrong with the 'patriotism' idea in this film. It demonises one side (i.e. the British) and shouts the praise of the 'Americans'. Given the terrible acts carried out by the United states since such as the massacre of the native American Indians and the constant wars to expand its own borders this movie should have been more evenhanded. Especially since the old imperial system so vilified by Americans resembles very much what America is today.It is important to say that I don't hate America and i don't go to rallies in which American flags are burnt, indeed I look to America as a source of friendship, yet why does the American film industry continue to make overly biased and plainly historically inaccurate films? Oh and as a matter of my own national pride, the wars of independence were won entirely because of the aid granted to the colonists by France!",7.0,Anonymous,History
Reviewers Mad,"To somehow attempt to view this as historically accurate is to miss the entire point of the film. It is not based on true events of the character itself since its fictional. The surrounding backstory is a real event, the character and anecdote is not. People discussing this is just low hanging fruitAs for anti-british ""bigotry"", i dont really care. I would assume that if this movie is in fact anti-british, it probably got something correct afterall. Since the founding fathers after all were not progressives and were trying to set up their own regime and colony outside of the british empire. They were white, and english originally, but they (in the creation of america/constitution) were establishing a seperate civilization. And you can see this demonstrably when u see wars between all various european groups.People are mad because of 3 reasons. 1 - its ""historical inaccuracy"". 2 - ""omg Gibson doesnt like english people!!!1 and 3 - its cheesy and patriotic.

Potential was not exploited,"The main problem with 'The Patriot' is the inconsistent pace. With a running time of just under 3 hours, the movie staggers between scenes where the pace is exactly right and then drifts back into inanities and treads water.Especially the backstories / subplots of the characters seem constructed and are meager. Some events are just slapped together and ticked off in a few scenes (according to the motto 'eat or die'). At the end of the day, these events only serve to advance the frame story and justify half-baked motives of the characters. For the viewer, this simply seems clumsy.Of course, you can say that the main focus is on the war actions. But then you can leave out the characters' sideshows completely. Either you do it sensibly or not at all. The movie is called 'The Patriot'. The motive is clear, it's about honor for the country. So it wouldn't have been a problem.Time and potential would have been there, there are interesting characters, but we learn almost nothing about most of them. The consequence is one-dimensional characters. This is especially unfortunate for the figure of Heath Ledger. Unbelievable potential is wasted here.The movie is quite well and quality staged, the fights and locations are authentic. Especially the beginning is really good, after that it stagnates. Highlight for me is also Jason Isaac. He proved once again what a great actor he is.Whenever the movie focuses on the fights and the war, then it can convince. As soon as it's about the part up to the next battle, the focus is set wrong in my opinion.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Predictability and hokeyness triumph over good acting,"Good acting, strong characters, and an attention to historic detail (details, not events or characters) could not completely make up for a predictable plot and general hokeyness.Gibson was excellent as the tortured main character, as was Ledger and in fact every one of his children.  The little girl who played the youngest even managed to make me feel like crying in one of the most manipulative scenes in the movie.  The attention to detail, particularly the courtship rituals and war scenes (cannonballs, ""surgery"", etc.), was excellent.  That, of course is offset by the trampling of any historical fact that might have marred the blah plot, but more on that later. The humor was good too, especially one particular sight gag that did not lose laughability even though they showed it about four times.The patriotism angle was extremely mishandled, making me laugh at their trite phrases when I was supposed to be moved by their ardor.  The real patriotism of that time would have been much more moving.  But, this is Hollywood and this is a Summer Blockbuster. The uninspired plot and predictability were the last straws.

What do the British think of this movie?,"Roland Emmerich saw Mel Gibson's ""Braveheart"" and what did he do? He thought the US should have its own Braveheart and called Gibson to help, giving him the lead role. This film begins badly: as I had occasion to refer to when I reviewed ""Braveheart"", Gibson's film is terribly bad as far as historical accuracy is concerned, however appealing and cinematic it may be (and it is, its undoubtedly epic). This film is unfortunately not better, at least historically and with regard to the English, who are portrayed in an almost insulting way. Okay, there are atrocities in war but everything has limits, and the British still had, at this time, a mentality very much for the gentlemen's war, at least the officers. I accept the argument that its fiction and not a documentary, but even if it is, it should respect more its historical background. I believe that many Englishmen did not accept the way this film portrayed their army. Despite this, the film has some historically correct details, as is the case with all the well built and elegant colonial settings and the costumes, in particular the military uniforms. The way the soldiers fought, quite formal in its essence, is also historically accurate. As a piece of entertainment, the movie works well. The epic way it was designed is nice, looks great in movies and even on TV. It has an extraordinary soundtrack by John Williams and cinematography, colorful and vivid, looks great. I also give a word of praise to the actors, Mel Gibson particularly. This actor had an interpretive tone very similar to what he kept in ""Braveheart"" but without that horrible fake Scottish accent. Here, Gibson seems more at ease with his character, a man seeking personal revenge in the midst of all the conflict he engages in. Heath Ledger, still young, also gives serious evidence of talent. Joely Richardson and Tom Wilkinson met what was expected of them, even though their characters did not require much. Jason Isaacs gave life to the villain and, although his character is not credible at all, he can be very sadistic and scary, showing the cruelest side of the war.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Deep thoughts amidst the cartoony glory,"Three things stand out about The Patriot.First, the production is gorgeous.  Both the beauty and the bloodiness of 18th Century life is captured with loving detail.Second, the production (effectively) uses every cliche and hoary stereotype they can to play up the melodrama.  Good guys are brave and noble, occasionally rash when driven to extremes, but of good heart and true. Bad guys are egomaniacal brutes, doing everything but twirling their moustachios.Third, countering the above, Gibson's character does a fine job of at least exploring the very real, very troubling questions of duty and violence. To whom does one have a duty -- self, family, neighbors, country, God?  How far does one go in pursuing that duty, to what depths of violence does one sink? What is just, what is honorable, what is socially acceptable, and what is moral?  How do you live with yourself after making such decisions, and seeing the cost they bring both to yourself and to others, either through your actions or your inaction?Though ultimately it all dissolves into a bright-hued melange of patriotic fervor and Happy Endings, at least these questions are touched on and mentioned before being discarded.  The lessons of the film touch directly on our lives and on world events -- one gains a new understanding of recent violence and warfare in the Balkans, for example, after watching The Patriot.",7.0,Anonymous,History

A good movie in need of some editing.,"First off let me say that I liked The Patriot, and I think it's worth seeing -- especially given that there are so few movies set during the American Revolution, and this movie's acting and production values are good.It's not a history lesson.  It doesn't purport to be a dramatization of actual historical events or the lives of historical personages though the inspiration for its plot can certainly be found among historical events. The only historical figure we see in the movie is a briefly glimpsed George Washington.  He doesn't speak and is seen from afar.The story centers around one Benjamin Martin, played by Mel Gibson.  He's a Carolina plantation owner, widower, and hero of the French and Indian War. The movie opens with Martin putting his souvenirs of that war, including an engraved tomahawk, into a trunk and cryptically stating that he fears his sins will come back to haunt him.  Those sins turn about to be organizing an atrocity against the French and their Indian allies.  His role in that event is known to almost everyone except his children, and the memories of war keep him from taking up arms against the British though he thinks the colonies should be independent.  His duty, he maintains, is to protect his family.But a son's willful enlistment in the Continental Army and the brutal actions of the decidedly ungentlemanly Tavington, an officer in the British Dragoons (his character is based on an actual officer nicknamed ""Bloody"" Tarleton just as Martin bears more than a passing resemblance to Francis Marion aka ""The Swamp Fox"" -- subject of a Disney movie of the same name) violently transforms Martin from a sullen neutral into the sort of violent avenger familiar from many of Gibson's other movie characters (see Hamlet, Riggs, Porter, and Mad Max) and, eventually, into a true patriot.I didn't mind this character arc, expected as it was.  Dramatically it works, and, historically, the brutality and military and diplomatic incompetence of the British did push many a person off the fence during the Revolution and into the arms of the rebellion.There are other things to like in this movie.  Historically, it does a good job in showing that not all the Colonials were pleased to have the French as allies, particularly the older soldiers who fought against them in the sometimes brutal French and Indian War.  The Carolina theater, with its savage guerilla warfare, a civil war where colonist turned on colonist, sometimes for political ends, sometimes to settle personal grudges, is well depicted.  And the movie shows a wide variety of Loyalist, British, and Colonials.  No side is universally brutal in the war.But the latter is part of the movie's problem too.  This movie has too much going on, would have been served by another edit.  Screenwriter Robert Rodat wrote the excellent Saving Private Ryan.  Here, though, free from dramatizing events set against a quite specific historical event, his focus drifts.  At times, he seemed to be trying to write two movies.  One is about the American Revolution and its ideals.  The other is darker and about the practical and moral dilemma of whether leniency or brutality is the best way to bring a guerilla foe to heel.  The latter is the more fascinating movie, but it often overshadows the story of the Revolution.  Indeed, this plot of atrocity and reprisal could have been set in many time periods (including Missouri during the Civil War).The movie also is weighed down by two romantic subplots.  One is a palatable, subtle romance between Gibson and the sister of his dead wife. The other is an intrusive romance between Martin's son and a woman whose main purpose is to satisfy the dramatic dictum that the innocent must suffer.The movie also suffers from a lot of movie cliches:  enemies who conveniently go down with one shot except, of course, the villain; many a coincidence; and dramatic entrances at darkest hours as well as some literal flagwaving (though, in the movie's defense, flagbearers at this time were important to not only the morale of the military but also to its tactical deployment and would remain so at least through the Civil War).  Roland Emmerich, never a particularly subtle director (Exhibit One:  his Independence Day), delights in sentimental tokens in a way that would warm the heart of a Victorian melodramatist.  Besides the nascent American flag, he drags out  lead soldiers and silver necklaces and uses them not once, not twice, but several times as touchstones of poignancy.I call them cliches.  But maybe these are what other people meant when they referred to the film as ""old fashioned moviemaking.""  However, the film's overuse of slow motion was certainly not old fashioned.Historically, I was slightly bothered by the rather unbelievable congeniality that slaves and freedman showed towards Martin, a slaveholder, and his family.  (Though the movie does accurately show blacks fighting for both sides.)  The flintlock handguns used in the movie also seem to have unbelievable range, accuracy, and lethality.Michael Mann's The Last of the Mohicans depicts the warfare of the period in a more exciting way.  Gettysburg and, of course, Waterloo do a better job showing the terror and tactics of Napoleonic style warfare though this may be the first movie to try and accurately depict the effects of cannonballs on massed formations as we see some decapitations and general maimings.So why do I recommend this movie?  Because, beneath the sentimental excess and dramatic cliches, there is an interesting story of brutal warfare on American soil, and Gibson, in two or three scenes, is allowed to show a genuinely dark character who (rather like Clint Eastwood in Unforgiven) has been reformed by the love of a now dead woman and finds his violent nature again brought to the fore.  And it troubles him and his family.",,Anonymous,History
This is history done wrong.,Once again Mel Gibson has made a real hash of history which doesn't sit well with people who know anything about the subject.As an action movie the film is okay and I think Heath Ledger is superb. The grand camera shots are fantastic which makes it all the more harder to bear. This is history done wrong. A film that is up there with the worst of them (Braveheart being top of the list) yet something pulled me towards it.I even bought it when it came out. Perhaps I liked the plot or perhaps I just forgot about history and simply watched an action film.Even so it is hard for an historian to like it completely. Even more so when one is English.Anyway the upshot is that as a historical film it flops flat on its face but as an action film it has its moments. Though I doubt I'll ever watch it again. Not after studying the subject further.,6.0,Anonymous,History

The main problem already is in the movie's title.,"This movie is so patriotic that it's not even funny anymore. I mean when the main character is literally fighting the English with an American flag, then you know that it can't get any more patriotic as this.Yet the movie is made with lots of profession and is still eye candy and entertaining to watch. The movie is not as heavy to watch as ""Braveheart"" but is still full with many epic battlefields of the same proportion.The balance of drama and spectacular scene's is fairly well and acceptable, with the exception of some needless plot lines that only waste time and the same goes for some of the characters. I have some mixed feeling about the story. The movie begins dramatic with Mel Gibson as a family man that is still coping with the loss of his wife, then it suddenly starts to focus much more on his oldest son (Heath Ledger) and finally for most parts on the war of independence. The way the story is told is not always good or logical.Another problem with the movie is Mel Gibson. A lot of complaints were that he played to much of the same character as he did in ""Braveheart"". I experienced this the same way back in 2000 when I saw ""The Patriot"" in the theater. Basically what I saw was an American William Wallace fighting for freedom. But yes I must admit that now 4 years later this hardly is a complaint anymore.Jason Isaacs once again was a pleasure to watch. His character was an incredibly stereotyped bad guy but he is such a great actor with such a great villain look that he actually made the character an enjoyable villain. Biggest surprise for me was Chris Cooper. Now, I know that nobody is going to believe me for saying this but I already felt back in 2000 that this guy would some day win an Oscar, something that happened in the year 2003 for his role in ""Adaptation"".The cinematography by Caleb Deschanel is wonderful and so is John Williams musical score, which both got nominated for an Academy Award along with Kevin O'Connell, Greg P. Russell and Lee Orloff for the category best sound.You'll most likely appreciate this movie much better if you are a (patriotic) American. For those people I rate this movie an 8/10. For everybody else this movie is nothing more as an entertaining movie without any memorable scene's or deeper meaning. For this majority I rate this movie an:7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,History

It sure deserves it. It's a lot better than ""Erin Brockavich,"" ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" ""Quills,"" ""Billy Elliot,"" or the dumb ""Traffic."" I hate those movies.

A corny epic but entertaining.,"Those who can abandon their sense of logic and knowledge of history may become sufficiently absorbed in this wannabee epic about American revolutionary freedom fighters to endure its 160 minute run time.

"""The Patriot"" is another epic that reaffirms all the genre characteristics applied to Hollywood's vision of conflict between nations, but delivers everything a war film needs","Until the early 2000s, Mel Gibson's name was on the rise and synonymous with the box office. A fact driven by several successes with the public and even critics, such as ""Braveheart"", which earned him several awards, including the main one from the Academy at that time. Well, this title directed by Roland Emmerich directly evokes Gibson's feature, only changing the dominated people, from the Scottish to the American.""The Patriot"" takes place in 1776 and we begin to follow the story of Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson), a war veteran, a widower, who fought against France and against the natives of the land, and understands the horrors of a battle. Traumatized, Martin seems to raise his family within universal anti-war values. With a gigantic family to raise, and young children to look after, Benjamin opposes the opening of an armed conflict with the British, for the independence of the nation, precisely to avoid yet another tragedy. And the character's motives are absolutely believable. However, the figure of his eldest son, Gabriel (Heath Ledger), appears as an obstacle to a more peaceful life. Gabriel Martin is a patriot and wants to fight for the nation, going against his father's wishes. And he will. It turns out that in the middle of the conflict he needs to return, injured. On this return, the British surround the city where Benjamin and his family live, and it is there that the British commit barbarities against his family, even killing one of his children. From there, driven by the feeling of revenge, Benjamin abandons pacifism and joins Gabriel in an attempt to build an army strong enough to destroy the British presence in the colony.As a war film, The Patriot brings an important difference: unlike works such as Saving Private Ryan, Platoon or The Cannons of Navarone, which narrate battles that took place in lands far from the residences of their protagonists, this film shows a bloody dispute that , as Gibson's character observes right at the beginning of the narrative, was fought in the backyards of the Americans themselves - something that allowed their enemies to attack their opponents' families in order to lower their morale (it is curious to see the Yankees suffering the same types of abuses that would come to inflict on the Vietnamese about two hundred years later). The scene in which one of the rebels discovers his wife and child dead, for example, is dramatic and shocking, causing a strong impact on the viewer.Incidentally, The Patriot is full of scenes like this - and there is nothing sadder than seeing a father handing guns to his children, still children, after instructing them to shoot at the enemy. Unfortunately, this is the reality of war, the most stupid and irrational way to resolve a basically commercial issue (in the end, it's always the money that counts). In any case, Roland Emmerich makes a beautiful historical reconstruction, being well advised by the excellent costumes of Deborah Lynn Scott (already a strong contender for the Oscar) and by the realistic art direction of Barry Chusid. The battle scenes are also strong and intense and - although they pale in comparison to the sequences of ""Saving Private Ryan"" - they end up shocking the viewer by their brutality.The film demonstrates what happened in the first act, with the death of the youngest son of Mel Gibson's character. Which is shocking for its realism and its meanness to a child. What follows next is already known. The direction does not abuse violence, but uses strategic moments to use it, as in the great war scenes, in which the characters' heads and legs are cut off, but with some caution so that it does not become just blood and carnage. Brutal in the right measure, the film feeds, for two and a half hours, a powerful climax, which is the moment when Benjamin comes face to face with his son's tormentor, Colonel William Tavington (Jason Isaacs). By the way, Jason Isaacs is insufferable in this film, a worthy executioner.The script, written by the same Robert Rodat of ""Saving Private Ryan"", is interesting and well structured, in addition to offering several moments that clearly work as comic relief - something practically non-existent in Spielberg's masterpiece. With that, Emmerich creates a film that, despite being ""easier"" to watch, causes less impact and has its drama diluted by the jokes. A good example resides in the scene in which Martin negotiates a prisoner exchange with General Cornwallis: amusing, the sequence makes the public relax momentarily. On the other hand, the naivety attributed to Cornwallis makes us take him less seriously, reducing the threat posed by his impeccable war strategies (besides, it's hard to believe that an experienced military man like him would accept Martin's conditions without even sending a messenger to ascertain the conditions of the officer's held hostage by the rebels). Another negative aspect of The Patriot can be found in director Roland Emmerich's constant attempts to manipulate the viewer's emotions in a Manichaean and unjustified way (proof of his lack of skill in the dramatic field): the sequence in which young Anne makes a passionate speech (but contrived) in a Church becomes embarrassing, clearly bearing the label of a ""Hollywood moment"": the music rises, the characters stand up one by one and everyone looks at each other with emotion. The result is ineffective and falsely ringing.However, the big problem with Rodat's script is the villain played by Jason Isaacs, a certain Captain William Tavington: stereotyped and poorly constructed, the character is the personification of the ""British evil"" portrayed by Emmerich. Sadistic and arrogant, he takes pleasure in coldly killing his opponents and their families. To top it off, he ends up taking on some typical characteristics of Hollywood bandits, including indestructibility - only the hero will have the power to defeat him, of course. Unfortunately, by summarizing the American Revolution to the figure of a villain, the script loses its main focus: instead of following the development of a war for the independence of a nation, we are led to summarize our expectations of the dispute between two men, who end up personifying the ""good"" and ""bad"" sides of the dispute. Thus, when the two finally confront each other, The Patriot loses momentum and concludes with a rushed narrative about the outcome of the war.Another curious aspect of Robert Rodat's screenplay is the neglect of the issue of slavery: the fact is that several important members of the American Revolution (including the man on whom Gibson's character was based) owned slaves, something that was completely ignored by the film (the only slave in the story serves only as an excuse for Emmerich to show how his militia colleagues come to respect his bravery). It would have been much more interesting if O Patriota addressed this curious paradox: the same men who fought for the nation's freedom denied this right to their slaves. Certainly, the film would only benefit from this new approach, which could perfectly replace any scene related to the love affair between Gabriel and Anne (Lisa Brenner) or Benjamin and Charlotte (Joely Richardson).Despite everything, this new work by Roland Emmerich is quite effective, even if it forces us to swallow the exaggerated American patriotism (but what could we expect with this title?). In any case, I regret to see that the film could have taken even more ambitious flights, being able to repeat the feat of works like ""Glory"" and ""Platoon"", which definitely serve as excellent studies on the insanity of war and on the very attraction that Americans feel for everything involving gunfire and battlefields. If the plot is not innovative, it is very well filmed. Directed by Roland Emmerich (Godzilla and Independence Day), with photography by Caleb Deschanel (Anna and the King) and soundtrack by master John Williams (Star Wars, Superman, Indiana Jones).The war scenes, despite the flying legs and heads, can't match the opening half hour of Private Ryan, both by the same screenwriter, Robert Rodat, and the hand-to-hand battles aren't as good as those that Ridley Scott either. Filmed with Russell Crowe in The Gladiator, but the film manages to excite, despite the excess of patriotism, as the title itself already shows. Mel Gibson's performance undeniably guarantees the film's heroic vibe, acting now with gallantry, now with violence. ""The Patriot"" is yet another epic that reaffirms all of its genre characteristics applied to Hollywood's vision of the history of conflict between nations, but which, on the other hand, delivers everything a war film needs.",8.0,Anonymous,History

"It's a movie, not a history lesson","I will never cease to be amazed by the criticisms leveled at films for their historical inaccuracy. To this I have two suggestions: go read a history book on the time and place depicted in a film or sign up for a history class! I love history, but have never watched movies to get a history lesson.Movies exist for one reason and one reason only - to entertain. In this regard, The Patriot does a fine job. The acting is excellent, and all the characters were well cast. The pacing was good, and I was never bored. The battle scenes were exceptionally brutal, which must be typical of combat situations throughout the ages. Most war films depicting the American Revolution are fairly sanitized or rely upon drama and acting to carry the story. Not so with Patriot - I'm surprised they didn't try to depict the carnage that undoubtedly resulted from firing grapeshot or cannister shot.Although realism is not typically a word I would choose for any film, I felt that the depiction of combat here was probably much more realistic than most such movies. Many history books will try to teach us that warfare in the 18th century was a bit of a ""gentleman's"" competition of sorts, where quarter was given if asked, and honor was observed in such matters as the beginning and end of conflict, prisoner exchanges, and the like. This may have sometimes been the case between fully professional forces like those of England and France, but such countries seem to have held a different opinion entirely of rebel forces. These were apparently regarded not only with disdain, but outright contempt. Afterall, those guilty of treason have traditionally been treated much more harshly than other enemies.Patriot seems to take this probability and run with it. The colonists who fought against England in the American Revolution were regarded as traitors, and were likely treated very harshly if captured or engaged in battle. The British in general were portrayed as pompous and at times villainous, but this is certainly not out of line for the way they undoubtedly felt about the rebels. Concurrently, I'm certain that the colonists who took part in the rebellion had a great deal of contempt for the British as well, but particularly for the Loyalists, or those colonists who remained loyal to and fought for Great Britain.My criticisms revolve around the flow of the movie. There are many, many tragic scenes that were obviously a plot device to hammer home the horrors of war. I felt that one or two would have sufficed to make such a point, but instead we receive multiple such scenes. Some chopping would have definitely been appreciated.Overall, Patriot is an intense, interesting take on a theater of the American Revolution that is not often depicted in film. I would recommend it to those who appreciate the genre of historical drama.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Do we look like idiots?,"As an American, I felt ashamed when I watched this movie. How must our British friends over the Atlantic feel when our movie industry produces a piece of historically inaccurate trash such as this? For any Brits reading this I can assure you that the assumptions made by this film are not the general opinion in our country (though this movie's performance at the box-office might suggest otherwise). Some of us have actually studied the events surrounding the war of independence and might feel that the British should NOT have been portrayed as Nazis. Unfortunately they are - despite the fact that they abolished slavery before us, a fact which proves they were more humane than we were at the time but which is lamely demonstrated in this movie. I've been to London recently and the Brits are amazingly tolerant about propaganda like this (not to mention Austin Powers). Luckily their famous sense of humor is alive and well. The whole film is an insult to the collective intelligence of the American people and that is enough to overshadow any positives aspects the movie might possess.",1.0,Anonymous,History

"Roland Emmerich makes a lavish action packed epic of the revolutionary war, that plays with the same exaggerated revisionism of an 80s Rambo type movie.","Set in South Carolina in the year 1776, French and Indian War veteran and widowed father Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson) seeks to live a peaceful life with his seven children even as tensions between the American Colonies and Britain continue. Benjamin tries to remain as divorced from the escalations as much as possible, but his eldest son Gabriel (Heath Ledger) joins up with the Colonial Army against his fathers wishes. Two years later as the Revolutionary War rages on, Gabriel returns home wounded and with dispatch orders. Benjamin offers aid and shelter to both British and Colonial troops who've been wounded, however the arrival of the brutal and sadistic Colonel William Tavington (Jason Isaacs) of the British Army's Green Dragoons orders the colonial wounded killed and Benjamin's home and surrounding land razed for providing aid to dissidents. Matters are further worsened when the dragoons find Gabriel's dispatch orders and arrest him to be executed as a spy and Benjamin's second eldest son Thomas (Gregory Smith) is killed for intervening by Tavington. Driven by anger and grief at the loss of his son, Benjamin uses his legendary skills to kill the regiment escorting Gabriel for execution and over time becomes a reluctant leader in the Revolutionary War.Written by Saving Private Ryan scribe Robert Rodat and directed by the 90s and 2000s answer to Irwin Allen, The Patriot fits well with the times in which it was produced. With the looming era of Bush and Neoconservatism awaiting us on the cusp of the new millennium (""irregularities"" in Republican tactics notwithstanding), The Patriot was in the right place at the right time with its romanticized take on the revolutionary war harkening back to revisionist 'Nam movies of the Reagan era in the 80s designed to aim with explosive spectacle and cheesy one liners to give wish fulfillment that stood in stark contrast to the realities of Vietnam. The Patriot is certainly better made than any of those old ""man on a mission"" films from that era such as Rambo, Mercenary Fighter, Strike Commando, or Uncommon Valor and disguises its purpose as violent wish fulfillment under a somber tone and epic production giving it the ""skin"" of something like Saving Private Ryan but the ""substance"" of Rambo, and depending on what you're looking for this is right on the money.Say what you will about German born filmmaker Roland Emmerich, but regardless of what you think of his films or their quality, the man knows how to cater to the broadest bunch of the American public he can even in regards to something like the Revolutionary War which traditionally has not seen too many winners at the box office such as high profile misfires 1776 and Revolution serving as examples of substantial loss on such endeavors. With The Patriot, Emmerich taps into the same gung-ho jingoistic mindset he played up in Independence Day except now rather than emulating Irwin Allen disaster epics with large ensembles of A-List stars, the movie focuses on a family in an extraordinary situation and a man seeking peace who through external forces brings out a dark side he'd long left behind. As typical with any Emmerich production subtlety has no place here, the idealized beginning is absurdly idealized the heroes and their arcs are absurdly delivered (including a racist soldier and a slave revolutionary who's intent on becoming a free man whose relationship goes exactly where you expect it to), and its villains are absurdly evil (often doing things that have little basis in historical fact). The movie boils down the Revolutionary War to one man's quest for vengeance against the man who killed his son and falls well within the framework of similar Mel Gibson revenge thrillers of the era such as Payback or Ransom except with tri-corner hats and muskets. The action sequences are quite solid with a particular standout sequence being Benjamin's one man assault on a British prison escort where he hides several muskets in the woods and moves around constantly to take down the regiment before running out of ammunition and using a Tomahawk. Despite Emmerich's reputation for CGI overload, when Emmerich is given an R-rating and practical effects he can show impactful and creative action and you get that aplenty here.The Patriot is exactly what you'd expect from an over the top director like Roland Emmerich teaming with an over the top actor like Mel Gibson when tackling the Revolutionary War. You get an above average revenge fantasy with some solid action, spectacle, and not an absolute middle finger to historical fact, but at the very least a prominent middle finger. The Patriot gives exactly what you'd expect from a movie of this time with this particular cast and crew.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Private Ryan was fictional as well, no one complained about that.Also the critics say that the person Mel Gibson's character was based on was a cruel savage beast of a man.  Well Mel Gibson's character is very savage, although he has been PC'ed a bit to make it more appealing.Those minor points aside this is an awesome movie.  The battle scenes are frighteningly real.

On of the only accurate things that is good, is Martin's comment about Cornwallis being a military genius. He was. He was, however, out of his comfort zone in dealing with the rabble of the American colonies. The Revolution contained many great stories, and any would make for entertaining watching.

It's only harmless fictional entertainment isn't it?,"Wow. You have a German director depicting the British burning down a church full of women and children. Now does that strike anybody else as ironic? After having read through the majority of these comments there seems little doubt that the film makers had their target market and they reeled them in. They went for the good ol' American flag waving, it's only a movie, don't take it seriously, good vs evil, black and white, don't need any depth or characterization, American movie goer. The more discerning American based comments do not like the movie for many reasons not only the 'dreaded' Historical Accuracy (it's only a movie! Geez) or the Nazi Brits. It really would be interesting to note American reactions if the shoe was on the other foot but then it wouldn't be Hollywood so they probably wouldn't watch it anyway. This film should not surprise people however. As someone else has noted Hollywood likes to portray the British as villains and has done so for many years. They always insult the American intelligence by figuring they need a simple good versus evil story and having an accent, preferably an English one, as the evil side fits in nicely with this. They must know what they are doing too judging by the money involved and the money the likes of this make. There is a disturbing trend towards skewing facts in movies and I for one do not subscribe to the fictional entertainment debate. The simple fact is a lot of people do not know, or care to know, history and they will take movies like this as fact. I know this from personal experience. It's absurd and insulting to the British. The sad part is it's only getting worse. 'U-571' took extreme liberties considering the US were not in the war at the time the movie took place and it was the evil Brits who actually captured the Enigma machine.

A great summer flick for all you musket carrying Patriots.,"Seems like the people making this film were trying to go for some big epic in the likeness of some other film about a war ravaged Mel.  Though this film is quite excellent, I have to say that this film has some glaring flaws.First of all I must say that the action scenes are very good.  The first gun fight with Mel acting as an one man army was superb.  And when you see a cannonball flying through the air, expect some type of appendage to fly off. Then after that, the scenes got duller and duller.  Though maybe historically accurate, watching a whole bunch of guys line up like idiots to take turns shooting at each other is not that exciting and somewhat agonizing to watch when one realizes the stupidity.  I guess nothing can really compare with hand to hand combat(especially with huge swords *hint hint*).As for the story, it was executed in a decent manner.  I loved the scenes in the beginning with all that father-son tension between Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger.  However, when the second half of the film came rolling along, the cheese was laid on pretty thick and it started to stink bad.  Though these scenes added a more light hearted tone at times, I felt it detracted from the dire tones of war.In addition I must commend the actors for doing a fine job.  I really had no trouble believing the father son relationship and the representation of the British villain by Jason Isaacs brought chills to my spine.Overall, I would recommend this film to just about anybody except for those impressionable young kiddies.  Though I wouldn't say that the action can compare to scenes from Gladiator or BraveHeart, I'd say they come pretty damn close.  With an awesome soundtrack, flying limbs, a likeable protagonist and cold-hearted villain, I'd say prepare yourself for one intense ride.",,Anonymous,History

Once Again Mel Gibson Hits the Mark,"Although I am not an avid movie watcher, I am an avid lover of excellent movies.  Mel Gibson has always been one of my favorite actors, and as with many, Braveheart would have to be one of my favorite movies.  Once again, Gibson has given a role such realism, humor, character, and gentle charm, to make The Patriot the must see movie of the summer, if not the year.  Mel Gibson was not the only person to make this movie great.The directing was superb, beyond anything I expected, and everything I hope to do someday.  Nothing in the movie, factual or technically, caused the viewer's concentration to be broken.  The costumes and props were amazingly accurate, and all fit the plot of the story perfectly.  The plot itself was realistic and contained many facts accurate with the war itself, causing me to feel as if I was actually witnessing a real event as it took place.  Violence, the reason the movie received an R rating, was abundant, but not overly used.  Although much bloodshed was shown, and gruesome ""hospital"" scenes were included also, they were strong enough to remember, but brief enough not to be overdoing it.  A testament to the excellent directing is the amount of superb performances by all characters.Every actor played their role beautifully.  Each performance was real, and plausible.  From the son to the slaves, all performances added to the story and brought their own little piece of realism to the movie.  Not one performance in the movie took away from the story, all were acted with great emotion and beauty.  Although, Heath Ledger's performance is perhaps as strong as Gibson's, and definitely advanced the story with great emotion and realism.  My praises also go to the editors, and the writers.Clean, I truly enjoyed the cleanliness of this movie.  I was not distracted from the plot by abundant and crude language, nor were unnecessary sexual scenes included.  So often good movies are spoiled by distracting sub-plots and unrealistic uses of vulgar language.  The language that was used at times fit the era, but was not over-used even then.  Thank you for writing a story that is so tight historically, and truly engulfs the viewer in some of the most heroic and tragic times of our country.To anyone, of any nationality, I would recommend to see this movie, at no point is it portrayed that the British are completely a cruel nation, rather that one man over-steps his boundaries.  For anyone this movie is a testament to true courage and perseverance, and is an inspiring and enjoyable movie to watch.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A solid 7,"I read the news paper review in the Winnipeg Free Press, and the guy chopped the movie down.  I decided to take my wife out anyways, because the reporter started to run anti American diatribe and would hate the movie regardless.  The journalist should learn some professionalism, because the movie was not that bad.  I gave it a solid 7 and I would probably have to see it a second time to pick up details I missed the first time, and probably like the movie even more.  Gibson is such a good actor, his accent helps in this film to give it realism.  Gibson is the type of actor whos physical gestures can really make a seen. It has great villains, family, revenge, and historical perspective that makes the movie believable.  The comeback of the historical epic is a nice change from your by the numbers, humdrum, action flicks.  This film will shock you, inspire you, and make you laugh.  My wife cried during one of the scenes, and if a movie can do that to a person, I think its worth the $8.50.",7.0,Anonymous,History
People lay off the harshness of the rhetoric,"Jeez,...this is JUST a movie people. Judge the movie on its own merits, please. Several comments for this movie are more comments about America versus being reviews of the film.Yes, as an American History teacher I know the film, in some ways, is highly inaccurate. The British are portrayed as devils, of sorts, as they behaved in ways that NEVER would have been condoned by anyone. In this regard, this is a VERY flawed film. But, remember this is Hollywood and the film is meant as entertainment. And, apart from the ridiculous way the British are portrayed, the film is about the most accurate account of the war to date. The style of fighting, excellent acting, beautiful music, location shots and showing the mixed attitudes of the Colonists towards the war earn high marks for the film. This is sort of an Americanized version of Braveheart.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A family caught in the current of great events,"This is the story of a man whose family is the most important thing in his life. That family is threatened by the outbreak of revolution and war. From the perspective of 225 years we call this event the Revolutionary War, but it was fought like a civil war because most Americans of the day considered themselves Englishmen.Mel Gibson is great as a man determined to hold his family together and keep it safe from the destruction of war. How well he succeeds or fails in this effort is what the film is all about.If you are my age you will remember the 1961 Jimmy Stewart movie, Shenandoah, set in Virginia at the outbreak of the Civil War. Shenandoah deals with the same theme found in The Patriot. I always thought Shenandoah was Stewart's best film. Mel Gibson's performance in The Patriot rises to that same level and I think it should earn him an Academy Award.Whatever comparisons you've heard involving The Patriot and Braveheart, forget them. Both films have great energy, sweep and thousands of extras but The Patriot tells a story to which every parent can relate. This is a film you must see. You will want to own it and see it often.This film has it all - scope, thousands of extras and poignancy. So... if you've got 2 1/2 hours you don't know what to do with, go see The Patriot.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Um, Okay","Peaceful farmer Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson) is driven to lead the Colonial Militia during the American Revolution when a sadistic British officer murders his son.You know, I love history, and the American Revolution is a fascinating period. Pretty much anything from 1600-1800 is just amazing to me. And yet, this film made it seem so silly and boring. Perhaps I should not be surprised when it was made by Roland Emmerich, who does not seem able to really add any gravity to his films. (See ""Godzilla"".) The worst part is the casting of Mel Gibson. Heath Ledger is great in any part, but Gibson just looks like a thug coming down from a weekend bender. He has a few roles he has played well, but is overall forgettable. And he helped make this film forgettable.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Long Live Banastre Tarleton,"Please if you have'nt seen this inaccurate Hollywood attempt at the American Revolution, then steer well clear.The character of Colonel Tavington makes a villain out of Britains military hero Major-General Sir Banastre Tarleton. A man who led a valiant loyalist force against the rebels. Brag all you want but the amount of Loyalists compared to Rebels is far greater. You can talk all you want about the ""Waxhaw Massacre"" but the fact remains a rebel shot Tarletons horse and his troops had a right to open fire at the spur of the moment, fearing they were going to be fired at.Anyway I won't go on anymore about Hollywoods attempts to make Tarleton a villain. The fact remains it is a bad film that does make the uneducated viewer believe the wrong things. EG :African-Americans overwhelmingly supported Britain and many units of these fine men were formed. :The Native Americans who for years have been portrayed far worse than us in Hollywood, also fought for us.I know there are many good Americans out there who recognise these errors and I applaud them for that. The fact remains though that Hollywood is turning Great Britain into a nation of villains.And another thing, stop calling us ""English"". WE ARE British. England, Scotland, Wales, Nothern Ireland even some Gibraltarians consider themselves British. Thats what we are. I can't tell you, that you must never call a Scotsman an Englishman. My mates were up in arms at this point.I'm not turning this into an Anti-American rant. On the contrary America is a fine country with much to offer, only Hollywood is educating Americans about the rest of the world for the worst.",,Anonymous,History
Another movie that surprised me....,"And in a good way, too. Given the title and subject material, I had expected to be deluged with ""Isn't America a wonderful nation"" type of dialogue and endless exposition of how freedom is to be valued etc. Whilst there is a certain amount of this, it was nowhere near as bad as I had feared an, as a result, I found myself enjoying the film for what it was - one man's struggle with his own demons and morals - and not yawning my way through the propaganda.Gibson gives a solid performance as the aforementioned haunted individual, reluctant to take up arms against the British as he knows what horrors war will bring.The British are portrayed variously as strutting fools or vicious, callous murderers. Jason Isaacs in particular is excellent as the commander who will stop at nothing to get the job done - in this case, crushing the American rebels. As a Brit, I suppose I should be more upset at the portrayal of my countrymen, but I know well what a dark time our colonial past was, so it didn't actually bother me. I actually found the characterisations rather humorous, which was perhaps unintentional. However, the characters are far too one-dimensional to take much exception to.There are some interesting battle scenes and some eye-openers too. For instance, the thought that warfare was once conducted by lines of men standing facing each other and shooting until one side was completely wiped out or ran away made me smile in disbelief at the foolishness of it all. The fact that it is also true is the most shocking thing. Now, of course, we can obliterate an enemy without ever having to look in his eyes, so you tell me which is the most insane.The story did seem to drag slightly in places, but not overly much, and the plot threads are very predictable. You know who will end up with who and who will die, who will win over the friendship of who, despite mistrust etc. But this does not harm the story in any real way.Overall one of those movies that will probably end up being shown on TV at holiday times. Worth a look.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Not Your Real Swamp Fox,"With the name changes of Francis Marion to Benjamin Martins and Banastre Tarleton to William Tavington, director Roland Emmerich was free to take a whole lot of liberty with the southern theater of the American Revolution. If anyone is expecting to see a factual account of what happened in the south from 1779 to 1781 they will be gravely disappointed.Mel Gibson is the Martins/Marion character and the biggest poetic license was taken with that character. Most basic of all Marion is presented as a family man who was a veteran of the French and Indian War and took up arms again when his plantation was sacked and son killed. Francis Marion was a bachelor, he got married and did raise a family after the Revolution was won. But that certainly would have knocked a very large prop out of Gibson's character motivation.Jason Isaacs is the Tavington/Tarleton character and he's every bit as nasty a piece of work as Banastre Tarleton was in real life. The man relished war and killing and believed in waging totally against His Majesty's rebels. The phrase 'Tarleton's Quarter' came into the language after he massacred some colonial troops who had surrendered. He was real big on those kind of atrocities, Governor Thomas Jefferson of Virginia fled with no dignity when he got word that Tarleton's troops were minutes away from Monticello. He knew exactly what the author of The Declaration of Independence would have received at his hands.It would have been poetic and nice if he had met his end during the Revolutionary War, but Tarleton went back to the United Kingdom and took up a seat in Parliament and was a noted defender of slavery and slave interests. You can see him at work doing that in the film Wilberforce which concerns William Wilberforce's campaign to halt the African slave trade.Heath Ledger as Gibson's oldest son and Joely Richardson make a fine pair of eager young people looking eagerly to a new nation dedicated to what Jefferson espoused in The Declaration of Independence. Rene Auberjonois's character of a fighting parson is borrowed from George Bernard Shaw's Reverend Anthony Anderson in The Devil's Disciple.Tom Wilkinson plays Lord Cornwallis and he appears in too many history books to give him a pseudonym. But for some reason Chris Cooper's character who was Cornwallis's opposite number is not called Nathanael Greene. He's one of the most remarkable commanders of the Revolutionary War, a man who never won a battle, but managed to hold the British army completely at bay in the southern theater due in no small part to people like Mel Gibson's Benjamin Martins(Francis Marion). There is mention in the film of General Horatio Gates who fled after the Battle of Charleston which the British totally routed the colonials and took the seaport of Charleston. It was Greene who was brought in to replace the mistakenly highly touted Gates.Francis Marion is sometimes given the credit of starting the use of guerrilla war methods, but that distinction properly should go to Major Robert Rogers during the French and Indian War. Marion certainly was skilled in the art of it as The Patriot shows. As for Rogers he was a Tory in his political beliefs and offered to get a guerrilla outfit going for the Crown, but was not taken up on his offer.The Patriot received Oscar nominations for Best Cinematography, Best Music Score, and Best Sound not winning in any of those categories. But the film deserved those nominations. John Williams in doing the music successfully integrated period songs with some modern themes and the cinematography, especially in the battle scenes showed what combat was like in that era. They were every bit as well done as Ted Turner's Civil War trilogy or Pearl Harbor.The Patriot if not the story Marion and Tarleton who probably never met face to face in real life is still a good depiction of the issues surrounding the American Revolution.",8.0,Anonymous,History

After all, 97% of the movies that are released during the summer are meant to appeal to anyone possible, except those who expect films to bring out more than trite surface emotions.

Ridiculous self-indulgent rubbish,"I've never seen a film with such astonishing revisionist tendencies as The Patriot.

And the fact that when the country actually got around to it they actually had to have another whole war because one side really wanted to keep African Americans in chains - these things mean nothing to the creators of the Patriot, who are only interested in playing the evil, corrupt, power crazed, racist big monarchist bad guys against the simple farmer folk who love black people and freedom and don't really even WANT to fight and who are actually Australian in upbringing.As films go, this one is insulting to all concerned, and particularly insulting to history and vague formless notions like TRUTH and JUSTICE (and through association, we would LIKE to assume, the American way)...",1.0,Anonymous,History
Good adventure but flawed history.,"Although, the film was enjoyable and the actors excellent, I felt that the script was written with 21st century attitudes, not 19th.  Often dialogue was glaringly modern as for example when a character says ""It's a free country (pause), or at least it will be"".  This is a modern phrase and I doubt that anyone in the middle of a revolution in that time would have ever even thought in these terms.Also, I felt that African-American characters and their interactions with the white characters were treated in a ""politically correct"" modern idiom, rather then a 19th century one.As a lover of history and with a special interest in the revolutionary era, I found these types of errors really irritating, and although I can recommend the film as a good adventure, it has very little to do with reality.",7.0,Anonymous,History

"A Rousing and Exciting, if perhaps a bit shallow, film","First, I would like to point out that I liked this film.  I liked it despite its many failings (and there are many).  I enjoyed myself, I felt compelled by the action and moved by the emotion (despite the inherent smarminess of some of the 'emotion jerking' scenes).  I would recommend the film to anyone looking for a reasonably good summer action film.However, I was a bit disappointed by the fact that this movie did not rise above the normal summertime conventions.  I was hoping for a Saving Private Ryan or a Braveheart, but instead got Lethal Musket 4.  Even the scenes that were intended to bring out the 'character' of Benjamin Martin did little but use exploitive camera shots and overly emotional music rather than relying on story and acting (not to dismiss Gibson's acting, which was quite good and convincing).  I lay much of the blame on Emmerich, who I feel could have done a much better job with the material he had to work with.The one scene in the film that I was particularly moved by was at the beginning, when Martin sets off with his two youngest sons to rescue his oldest son from the British.  I felt that this scene communicated well the pain and distress of a veteran who had been forced into a violent confrontation that he did not want (my own father was a Vietnam vet, and the scene did resonate a few chords with me).  This was an intelligent, disturbing and moving scene.However, the rest of the film had a difficult time deciding what it wanted to do, and how it wanted to do it.  The battle scenes were somewhat exciting, but far too clean (especially considering the technology of that period), this was not a war film.  The romance was underdeveloped and confusing, this was not a romance.  The history was highly inaccurate and overly dramatic (which I do not have a problem with, per se), so this was not an historical re-enactment.  So what was this film?Essentially, it was a bunch of action scenes and politically correct niceties tied together into a fun summer film package.  The movie seemed to have wanted to be taken seriously, but never became serious.  This is unfortunate, but not tragic.  The Patriot is a film worth seeing (particularly on the big screen), but don't go expecting SPR or Braveheart, you will be disappointed.  I did not go expecting that level of film, and I was pleasantly surprised.  Enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Largely a revenge tale,"This film takes the romanticism out of eighteenth-century/Napoleonic-era warfare and lays bare the brutality of musket and cannon fire into packed ranks. And then, of course, the bayonet charges and ensuing hand to hand combat is not really much different than the battles of Caesar's legions. The film is beautifully photographed and well-directed. However, the title ""The Patriot"" is quite unfortunate, given that it is largely a revenge tale (Mel Gibson's forte) that happens to have the Revolutionary War as a backdrop. Gibson is, by turns, charming and ultra-violent. Joely Richardson was lovely here, although I may not have recognized her in the period costumes.

Don't waste your time: If you want to see a great war film (dealing with rebellion against tyranny) - go watch Secondløitnanten (1993) (finally available on video/DVD).

Historic inaccuracies .....,"... are always a good reason for many people to bash an otherwise excellent movie. I have already encountered many examples of this practice here (U571, Saving private Ryan just to name a few). Fortunately, this sort of undue criticism can be easily seen through. Since it are always the people who find that their heritage is done injustice who write these sorts of reviews, they can easily be identified and ""filtered out"" through their location which they seem to be so proud of. Come on you Brits, are you really that narrow minded? Get a life! How do you think the Germans ought to feel about every other villain in a Hollywood production having a German accent? Luckily those poor guys have no clue because 99% of them only watch the German dubbed version in which the good guys speak German too. Belgians for instance are always pictured as a bunch of idiots: the rest of the world is made to believe that the only intelligent Belgian around is Hercule Poirot and he is so eccentric and ugly than no Belgian would want to be compared to him. Hey even Jean-Claude Van Damme is so embarrassed of being Belgian that he always plays a character from France or Canada to justify his accent.Anyway, The Patriot is a really great movie which just has about everything to offer: Romance, action, drama, suspense and superb cinematography, but you have to take it for what it is: fiction, no more no less.Please lads, If you really insist on seeing historically accurate things go watch documentaries instead but be very careful which ones you choose because the truth can hurt a whole lot more than fiction.",10.0,Anonymous,History
No Braveheart but still is enjoyable,"The Patriot is yet another war-epic by acclaimed acotr/director Mel Gibson. Set during Revolutionary War, Gibson portrays fictional militia leader Ben Martin driven to war by the loss of a son by British soldiers. Now, Martin will stop at nothing to defeat the invading British and save the young country.The Patriot is not exactly original. It follows the same reasons for a man going to war as Braveheart did with Gibson in the lead. Gibson isn't bad, his character isn't exatly an easy one to play but he's played it before so it comes naturally. He is able to portray a lovable father and military man at the same time which is often hard to do.Jason Isaac's plays the British colonel responsible for Martin's son's death. He is superb. he's cunning, he's full of hate, and is easy too hate. You are able to relate to the hatred felt by Martin very easily. He does by far the best job of the actors.There are some problems to the film. The innacuarcies are numerous whether it concerns the battles represented or characters in general. What bothered me the most are characters not taking enough things serious. For example the militia destroy the vessel outside of Cornwallis' estate and Colonel Tavington just drinks up watching it even though the colonial militia is right outside their door. There at war for God's sake.However even with the inaccuracies and the characters being a bit too one-dimensional it does give an excellent story to its audience. The battle scenes are visually stunning and suspenseful. The film shows us the 'honorable' way of fighting in lines of men facing each other and firing until either line retreats or is destroyed. It is quite interesting really to watch the old style of fighting and compare it too war of today. The film, in the end, portrays the message of taking war-fare to far and freedom. The drama is very good and villain is top-notch. Hopefully it's entertaining for you, it certainly was for me.The Patriot.

An Honest Review,"I have issues with this. The American Revolution was filled with lofty goals of real freedom, the kind that the world had never seen before... and this ignored a lot of them.At the same time the war in the South, well that was a totally different beast and as much as the British might love Banastre Tarleton (or whatever he is called in this film) and as much as Wikipedia might have white washed him, the man was nothing more than a butcher and a rapist.There were atrocities on both sides, but when The Swamp Fox did them, they called them ""Tarleton's Quarter"" for a reason.And this film does some justice to the Southern front in the Revolution, and it wasn't until the rise of Communism that the western world saw someone that delighted in depopulating as much as he did.It goes really soft on a lot of what happened down there, and it has to in order to keep the rating below an X.But it does a good job of depicting Francis Marion and how he waged a guerilla war and didn't just march into battle and stand still for the British to kill... especially since they were outnumbered and out gunned.And it did an excellent job of showing the grudge between the Americans and the French, who were very unlikely allies... especially in the South.So as much as I hate this movie and give it one star, I still go back and give it 10 stars because I love it just as much.",10.0,Anonymous,History

It should have been called 'TRAITOR',"Once again, Hollywood (and Gibson) try to re-write history. As with the anti-English 'Braveheart', films like this load of nonsense fail to point out is the truth behind the myth. Whilst mistakes were made by British officers, they were by no means the buffoons portrayed in this film. Having been saved from take over of the Colonies by the French, the colonists then refused to help pay for their own protection via taxation, and a number decided to revolt against their Country (Great Britain). By no means was the revolt a popular one and thousands of colonists fought for their home Country against the rebels. Others remained neutral. The French, Dutch and Spanish didn't fight much in the Colonies as they declared a World War on Britain and attacked or threatened British possessions everywhere they could - especially India, worth a LOT more than the colonies at that time. They were no fools and could see the danger to Britain of fighting on several fronts at once. It was less 'let's help the rebels' - more 'let's help ourselves, while we can'. This in turn drained the treasury and resources which meant that German troops were sent to fight. These troops were trained to fight European wars, and not against amateurs who rarely stood up to proper battle. Eventually UK troops had to surrender when a French fleet stopped the reinforcements and supplies reaching Yorktown. After that, the traitors succeeded and 'Independence' was gained. A high % of the colonists then moved to Canada. Funny thing is, the War ruined France, leading to the Revolution (thousands murdered) and the sale of Franco/American colonies to the new US. In the 1800's, the American Texans decided to revolt against the Mexican Government and stole Texas. Americans generally don't like France, which is ironic as but for them they'd never have achieved 'Independence'. Hulk prison ships were used mainly in the Anglo/American war of 1812, by the way. And the reason for the White House being WHITE? It was painted to hide the charred walls when British forces tried to burn it down when the American forces were pushed back from Canada to Washington. British officers even ate the Presidents dinner as he was in too much of a rush to escape. I love my American friends - but get SO tired of teaching them their own history....",,Anonymous,History
What great war films are made of,"Let me start out by saying that ""The Patriot"" is one of the greatest films I have seen in a very long time. Its tremendous originality comes from the fact that no other movie(s) about the Revolutionary War have been quite like it. And buried within the film it tells a story of a family. This family is slowly, and unhappily torn down by the war. It is a very sad film in the way that the family is destroyed(many of Mel Gibson's children are violently killed)and it really shows the bonds that they hold with one another. Another aspect that I particularly enjoyed was the acting. Jason Isaacs(Event Horizon) does an excellent portrayal of a ruthless antagonist, and Mel Gibson also does a splendid job as a father, desperately struggling for redemption and vengeance. I recommend all 165 minutes of this film, because even though you will cry, the overall film is not depressing, and the end will leave you with a smile on your face.Note- I also want to say that the MPAA was foolish in their rating decision. Small children probably should not see this, but as for teenagers and the like, it is certainly appropriate.My rating(1-10):10",10.0,Anonymous,History
Strong Movie.,"The acting is good, the shots are beautiful and the battles look great. Unfortunately, this movie is amazingly inaccurate. I can understand distorting some facts in the name of art, or ""hollywood license"" but this film just takes it to another level. Another part I did not like was the score, it literally put me into a rage every time I heard it. This movie is unbelievably melodramatic (even more melodramatic than an episode of Greys Anatomy, and that's saying something!).Despite that, it's still quite good. Before I saw this, I expected there to be a lot of ""go America"" Flag waving, but to my surprise this was a lot more subtle than I expected. Although, it does exist (to the point where Mel Gibson is actually waving a flag). The acting is good, especially Mel Gibson. I watched this film because I absolutely love both Tom Wilkenson and Chris Cooper, and I wasn't too disappointed. Watch this film for it's battle scenes, they are great (they pale in comparison to the 1968 adaptation of War & Peace, but are great nonetheless), and there is also some humor in this film at times. My one concern is the negative portrayal of the British. They are our close allies and are a nation of tradition, history and class, they deserve better than that. I understand that the movie needs a ""bad guy"" but they didn't have to go as far as they did. I hope the Brits understand, that this is just a good, old fashion summer blockbuster, nothing more. Other than those things, the film was better than I expected, I did enjoy most of it. I hope you will too. Unless of course, you're British.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Not all you see is true,Just wanted to note that not everything you see in this film is true. The most controversial one was the rounding up of women and children and putting them death. This alone spoiled the film for me as it was not only not true it was grossly unfair to the British and how they conducted war. Does anyone in their right mind believe that the Americans would have come into WW2 to save the British if an event like that had really taken place. Not a chance.More likely it was a crude attempt to compare the British with the Nazi's who did in a very famous incident round up women and children and burned them in a church in Ordouver France. That was the most glaring inaccuracy. The other most glaring inaccuracie was the treatment of the people who became the United Empire Loyalists and emigrated to Canada after the war. Yes there were soldiers but remember they were soldiers in the British army taking orders. They were not brutal monsters as the movie would have us believe. Nor were others who were eventually made up the United Empire Loyalists. They just supported the losing side. In fact there were well documented brutal attacks by the American patriots on the United Empire Loyalists after the war. So who were the brutes?Most of the others were dumb like firing muskets in the rain. Sorry you can not light a musket in the rain. The movie was reasonably good but the glaring inaccuracies spoiled it. Unfortunately the vast majority of people will blithfully accept it as the truth. It appears the first casualty of a war movie is also truth. The makers of the film should be taken to task for this.,6.0,Anonymous,History
The Patriot should become a classic.,"I had been waiting for a long time for the release of The Patriot.  But, because of recent reviews, I had some reservations about the film and if I would see it at all.  Besides being a movie buff, I'm a history nut and Family Genealogist, so the haggling over historical accuracy was a factor influencing me. Unlike most people, too much playing with the facts would turn me off Very much.  Well, I'm happy to say that The Patriot, despite some minor transgressions, is a Very Entertaining movie and should be a classic in its genre for years to come. Sure, it doesn't emphasize just how much loyalty to England there was in the south, hence the reason England shifted their strategy there.  How Loyalist militias were involved.  Nor do they show the approx. 80% support the blacks gave the British as well, making the refugee hideout very unlikely.  Logistical errors, such as large mortars at inland campaigns during the Revolutionary War, can be forgiven since it didn't figure prominently. The story is about his family and the events that effect them.  It's about Personal sacrifice and principle.  This is where the story makes its biggest statements.  If most people stopped and realized that the Revolutionary War was NOT a popular war, but one fought by a minority of people dedicated to the cause, they would probably be shocked.  Such was the sacrifice those people made to create the first real Democracy since ancient Greece. Martin's character is Not based just on one person, as some critics try to claim in order to deflate the film because of the background of that person, but on a composite of at least four people.  The idea, after all, is to present the movie based on the events of the time.  It's not a documentary. In this sense, it fulfills its purpose very well.  Excellent entertainment with some minor historical alterations doesn't hurt this film.  Ignore the over sensative hupla about the ""errors"" and enjoy a very good film. Ladies....bring some tissue.  There were very few dry eyes amongst the ladies I seen leaving the theater.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Good film,"Good filmRodat wonderfully establishes many bonds and then breaks them abruptly with the death and destruction of war. Truly there is more suffering in this movie than I have seen in almost any, and it makes the payoff at the end (you were aware that we actually win the war right?) that much better.

Be it the minute-man behind the bushes style, or the open field style Emmerich milks every dramatic possibility from these old style battle tactics.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Those English are awful people.  Let's kill 'em.,"(That was sarcasm.)Hollywood's general portrayal of the English is puzzling. (Not being English myself, I make this comment as a neutral and detached observer.)First, you have your garden-variety romantic comedy.  An English person in a typical romantic comedy is a moderately cute blond guy dressed in unprepossessing catalogue attire and touting an exaggerated British accent, which passes with the general public not only as a sign, but as the very essence, of sophistication.  Indeed, what a hottie a British man is: foreign enough to be exotic, but not too much so; just enough accent to make English sound like a foreign language; and yet, you don't have to learn a language to communicate with him -- which, given the Americans' overwhelming aversion to foreign tongues, is of utmost importance.Then you have the other genres, in which the English characters range from sterile and repressed to downright demonically villainous.  THE PATRIOT adheres to the latter stereotype.  I cannot begin imagine how offensive this movie is to the English viewer.And what of history?  The American revolution was the revolution of the intellectuals; it was over taxes, fine points of political participation, the meaning of citizenship -- it was not prompted by acts of extreme terror and genocide, as the  movie seems to suggest.  There was violence to be sure, but it occurred on both sides, and it was neither the long-term cause nor the trigger for the American Revolution.  And let us not forget those colonists who were severely punished by expropriation of their property, banishment, imprisonment, and execution merely for refusing to renounce their allegeance to their original sovereign.Of course, the sophistication of the revolution's causes does not mean that the colonists were unjustified in rebelling.  But the Americans are forever plagued by a nostalgia for a story of woe more compelling than that saga of resentment over the stupid stamp taxes.  We envy older nations their titanic struggles, their big chunks of suffering.  WE did not have a Hitler.  WE did not have to struggle for our very survival as a people and a culture (yet). For all that lofty verbiage in the preamble to the Declaration of Independence, the grievances that follow it seem boring and petty.To that extent, THE PATRIOT is a miserable cry of that nostalgia rather than a conscious indictment of the English.  Though I doubt that would make the English viewers feel better.",,Anonymous,History
Enjoyed this movie,"First I would like to comment on those who say that Mel Gibson's character was based on Francis Marion. That is partially true. I have the movie on DVD and I watched the featurette on the film. The moviemakers in this featurette said that Benjamin Martin was based on three characters, including Marion. Now I would like to comment on the movie. I thought it was well done. In particular I enjoyed the musical score and how it added to the different moods in the movie. The ending was appropriate with the visual of a house being rebuilt symbolizing the work that needed to be done now that the war was over. This movie is highly recommended!

A great movie that deserved all the acolades it got,"I believe it was even nominated for all 11 of them. A great film with Mel Gibson and his acting chops are incredible. Heath Ledger too. This was a great movie. It's the familiar American Revolutionary War history, personified into a story of a farmer named Benjamin Martin, a father who was part of the French-Indian War (I won't get too into it, you have to see the movie for yourself; all I can say is this is part of the character and the movie's plot and builds onto his character in the movie). He lost his wife and is a widower (similar to his role in ""Signs,"" 2 years later), and some of the familiar topics of a father dealing with loss are part of it. Here we see his ascent from a reluctant man who is opposed to war (not because he's a pacifist, or opposed to the war effort -although he was cynical about it, as one scene shows, because he asked what would make 1000 tyrants a few miles away better than one tyrant 9000 miles away - but because he has 2 sons and a daughter to raise with his new wife) into a major hero who spearheads the Revolutionary War effort, and the Continental Army. A movie that hits it hard from start to finish, with great performances.Unlike what one user said, this notion that Spain is Hispanic is hilarious and moronic. It's just a cover for the racial definition. Nuyoricans and Italians are non-white, Hispanic, Latin with Latin English accents.Cinemax content advisory: rated R for violence (V) and adult language (AL).",9.0,Anonymous,History

Another 'Gibson',"was my first thought, by which I meant 'historically inaccurate' which is a pity as I know Americans who think it's an accurate portrayal of their history (my second thought was 'Hollywood'!!) which is bad enough but Gibson should know better so why does he make these sorts of inaccurate films? Money of course. Ham it up & the dumb punters will flock in with it by the barrow load. Thank goodness there are people around on sites like this to put the record straight. HOWEVER it is a dramatic film but should be shown with warnings about the inaccuracies. The filming and costumes and the whole production is excellent but as I say, as others have, spoiled by the anti-British tenor.",,Anonymous,History
"Very enjoyable film, but don't expect a history lesson.","An exciting movie in the rare film setting of the American revolution. This film is more about family than the war though. Family is the reason Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson) wants to stay out of the war, and family is the reason he eventually gets involved. The acting by everyone is very good, especially Gibson and Heath Ledger. Their developing relationship is very believable. I would have liked to see a little more on the philosophical reasons for the revolution itself which were pretty much glossed over in the movie. The violence tends to get a little gratuitous, some scenes more for shock value than plot advancement. The violence aside I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to any adults who feel they can handle those kind of scenes.",7.0,Anonymous,History
This is my favorite movie.,"I like this movie ""The Patriot"" because it so realistic.

Their gun is one shot per reload, so their fight like stupid who stayed in the line while hoping that the bullet will miss in their head. I remember when we were watching this movie with my family and cousins, 6 years ago. My 7 years old tom boy cousin ask us why the soldier eats candy while their still in war? haha She meant that the soldier was reloading their gun by tearing the bullet by their teeth and she thought that they were eating a candy on that time.

Dangerous Propaganda,"I don't like to use the word 'pretentious' very often. It's a 'high-sounding'word often used to dismiss something or someone without explaining why.

I believe it preached hatred too. It was'Bloodthirsty. It showed nothing but ignorance of history; villifying the British. It is a known fact that 1/3 were revolutionaries, 1/3 loyalists and 1/3 in the middle. It is sick how it vilifies the British commanders as genocidal scum, and then makes out the loyalists as dishonourable weasels.

"An Amazing Movie, Depicting Accurately America's Proudest Moment","What the heck are all of you people talking about when you say that this movie isn't accurate! It is by far more accurate than some I have seen. First, let me say that I'm an avid fan of Braveheart and I believe that The Patriot ranks right up there with it. The story is wonderful. It keeps you on the edge of your seat not knowing what is going to happen around the corner. I'm also one of those who believes that great special effects are not the only key in a good movie, but with The Patriot I was in awe.Now, it's my opinion that The Patriot was very accurate. First of all, for all of you saying how cruel the British were, Col. Tavington was about the only one. All other depictions of the British, such as that of General Cornwallis, made them out to be good men only striving to be gentlemen and follow the rules of war. Cornwallis even chastises Tavington many times for his cruelty. Along with this point, I don't think the Americans were seen as ""god-like"" by any means. Yes, they were seen as idealistic and good-hearted in many cases, but Benjamin Martin (Gibson) was fighting with his utter cruelty during the French and Indian War throughout the entire movie.As for the accuracy, the clothing, sets, language, and characters of this movie definately came close to perfectly matching those of American History. For example, while some the characters of the actual movie are not historical, most are based on men who did live. Mel Gibson's character is made up of many men who lived during the Revolution, including the ""Swamp Fox"". And for all of you who say Jason Isaac's character was depicted as too cruel, he was based on a historical British officer.Now, I do agree that Mel Gibson's role in this movie was very much like his role as William Wallace in Braveheart, but he unfortunately, he is one of the best men in Hollywood to play the role. And for those who might say he shouldn't have played the role because he is Australian, Mel Gibson was born in New York. He didn't move to Australia until he was eleven. You might want to check your accuracy before you make that comment.",6.0,Anonymous,History

"America's birth, bathed in blood","There have not been many films about the American Revolutionary War. That is somewhat surprising as there are so many stories there to be told. The Patriot tells the story of one man, Benjamin Martin, who fights for his family. If at the end of the fighting independence has been achieved that is all well and good. But for Benjamin Martin family comes first. He is reluctant to fight, unwilling to place his family in danger. He won't go to the war. But the war comes to him. Right to his front porch. With horrifying consequences. And so Benjamin Martin takes up the fight. And what a bloody fight it will be. Nobody ever said the birth of a new nation would be pretty. There will be tragedy, heartbreak and grief along the way. Nothing worth fighting for comes easily.It is a blow to his family which drags Benjamin into the war. A blow which will be avenged quickly and savagely. The tone is quickly set for a film which will be bathed in blood. But there is more to Benjamin than brutal violence. He proves to be smart, cunning, an inspiring leader. Mel Gibson gives an excellent performance in the role, capturing all that makes up this very unique man. There is a quiet dignity and honor to Benjamin Martin and Gibson brings that out. But there is that brutal side to him as well and Gibson handles that with aplomb too. Speaking of brutal, there is the film's main antagonist, the unspeakably evil British Colonel Tavington. When first we meet him he commits an obscene atrocity. And it only gets worse from there. This is truly one of the most reprehensible film characters ever. Jason Isaacs relishes the role, embraces the evilness. It's a solid performance from Isaacs but the character really does go too far. He's too evil. He does things which simply are not believable. Yes there were surely atrocities committed in this war but this film takes the character past the point of no return. Bad things may have been done but not that bad. No wonder so many British critics were up in arms upon the film's release. It's good if a film has a villain you can truly despise but this villain is just too much. He leaves such a bad taste in your mouth that it detracts from the film.The over-the-top villainous Tavington is not the film's only flaw. There is a lot of dialogue that is clunky and awkward. The film clearly goes on too long, approaching three hours and at times really struggling to sustain itself for that length of time. But despite the flaws the film does enough good things to be deemed a success. Gibson is excellent, Isaacs a worthy foil. Other winning performances come from Heath Ledger as Benjamin's son, so eager to join the fight, and Chris Cooper as an American Colonel trying to hold his ragtag army together. If you want a bit of romance there's that too, Joely Richardson and her absurdly bountiful cleavage paired up with Gibson and bright, young Lisa Brenner for Ledger. And then there is the war itself, the brutal battles. The film spares nothing in its gory accounts of 18th century combat. The close-range gunfire, the bloody bayonets, and the cannonballs that do truly grotesque things to a human body. There are two good stories here, the big picture revolution and the more personal story of the Martin family. Those stories are meshed together very well by director Roland Emmerich. We haven't gotten many American Revolution stories in films. This one, flawed and highly fictionalized though it may be, is ultimately a satisfying one.",7.0,Anonymous,History

I enjoyed this film much more then Gladiator, because it delivered in so many more ways.  Gladiator is only superior in the acting department.  The Patriot's action scenes are alive and vivid, as opposed the closed in feeling that Gladiator had.  The Patriot's finale, or the final battle to the film, contains wonderful action sequences.

'Braveheart 'Fights For America This Time,"This is ""Braveheart"" all over again, except instead of mid-whatever-century Scotland and England, it's the United States and the American Revolution. Mel Gibson plays a similarly- heroic person he played in Braveheart but he's still fighting the British, time time as an American patriot ""Benjamin Martin.""The cinematography is a high point in this movie, with lots of pretty shots outside and inside. It's just stunning at times. Kudos to cinematographer Caleb Deschanel for a job well done. It's also a terrific audio movie with a lot of surround sound that's impressive, especially when the cannons are shot.Storywise, it's nice to see the hero praying and asking for God's forgiveness when he's too violent. Meanwhile, Jason Isaacs is brutal as the villain, ""Colonel William Tavington."" (The Brits complained about this film saying that character was unfair and also that Cornwallis is made to look a bit too stupid. For that reason, anyone who lauds this movie gets negative votes from the Brits.)Yes, this is All-American flag-waving which nauseates Liberals but makes most the U.S. citizens happy and it's certainly something one hasn't seen much in films since the 1950s. Good for Mel Gibson!Even though it's considered an ""epic,"" I would like to have seen this cut down a bit from 165 minutes which is a tad long. Warning: this gets a little bloody in parts. It's not as gory as Braveheart, but there is still a good deal of violence. There is no problem with the language, however.In all, a powerful story beautifully filmed.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Neesdless to say that is not going to happen as his sons get drawn into the battle. The old warrior comes back and starts fighting the British.Heath Ledger plays one of his sons, while the ever lovely Joely Richardson plays his sister-in-law (wife is dead).

Historical hogwash,"I'm an American, but I don't hold a grudge against the British.But there are some people who hold grudges for decades, apparently including the director, Roland Emmerich, or for centuries, like the star, Mel Gibson. And some, sadly, hold grudges based on lies.This movie is not about history; it is a grudge-fest based on lies.The movie has a scene of the peaceful American townspeople, after being lured inside a church, being killed when the British set fire to the church.I think that if anything like this had actually happened, I would have heard about it, particularly in my college course on the American Revolution. The British, and especially their German mercenaries, weren't saints, and neither were the Americans, but they were downright gentlemanly compared to the sadists portrayed in this anti-British propaganda.I would chalk it up to just another bit of historical nonsense from the film industry if it weren't for Mel Gibson, who has a long track record of such historical garbage, or for the German director Roland Emmerich.You see it was Nazi Germany that actually went around massacring whole villages in cold blood. The scene Emmerich portrayed in ""The Patriot"" actually corresponds fairly closely to what the German Wafen SS did at the French town of Oradour-sur-Glane in 1944. They lured all the women and children in the town into the church, and after they finished listening to the killing of all the town's men, the Germans killed everyone in the church. You can see pictures of what remains of the town on the internet.This was not the only time Germans massacred entire towns in France; there were also Tulle, Ascq, Maillé, Robert-Espagne, and Clermont-en- Argonne. And Nazi Germany did the same in many other European countries and in the Soviet Union.It seems Emmerich wants to create some equivalency between the British and the Germans by portraying an entirely fictional scene in a mostly- fictionalized movie about the American Revolution.Sorry, Roland, but myth does not equal history. Neither the British nor any of the Allies went around killing entire towns out of revenge, or for pure sadistic pleasure, as the Nazis did.Sadly, some viewers will come away believing the hogwash in ""The Patriot"" if they watch it. Your best bet: don't watch it.",1.0,Anonymous,History
The Patriot is a perfect example of the degradation of Amerian cinema,"When I saw The Patriot, I shook my head. This is what modern film has come to. This movie made millions of dollars, and what does it really do for humanity? What cultural value does it have? Absolutely none. It tells the same old glorious story we've all heard since 5th grade about the under dog American rebels taking arms against the big bad British empire for freedom and liberty. BS. All the stuff about patriotism and honor and fighting for one's family and country is so cliche. The characterization is completely formulaic and unrealistic-on one side you have the evil British guy who seems like his only job on earth is to kill every American rebel, and on the other side you have the strong but gentle family man called to action to defend his family and his country...wow, we haven't seen that before. There is no depth to this movie, no deeper meaning...basically, no point.",,Anonymous,History
May impure blood water our fields! (dvd),"I don't know the exact reason but the American Revolution have always interested me (more than mine in 1789). Maybe it's because as a kid i had a wargame called ""Yorktown"", that was unfortunately unplayable but with a board and pieces fascinating. Last year, i read the novel ""New York"" from Rutherfurd and the years of this war were among the best pages of the book. In movies, i recall only ""Revolution"" with Pacino that i sadly rate ""1"". Thus, my expectations were high with this movie, all the more that it included my best actor behind Pacino, this is to say Mel Gibson.Mel differs from Al in the sense that Mel is more fatherly but in the meantime more torn by inner madness. Here, his two traits are brilliantly exposed but the movie is far more interesting by the fact that it makes understand how it is to be a civilian victim of war.Today, war is a TV show and we are faraway of any threats. Here, the battle happens in your garden, your house is destroyed by the first belligerent that comes, your community is shot to make up for the lost battles.Next, the movie is a great lesson of history: it recalls that France had really been decisive in helping the colons and that it was the only army before 1950 where whites and blacks were fighting together.With all those facts and a beautiful cinematography, the movie is a very strong drama. On a more trivial note, i only knew Ledger as his Joker part and seeing him naturally and playing a good son was moving.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A let down,"8/10.  Not as good as ""Braveheart.""  A lot of the battle scenes and backdrops were obviously computer generated/computer enhanced.  Contrast this with ""Last of the Mohicans"" where the battle scenes were much more realistic.  Also - I was not that impressed with Mel's performance in this movie.  It was inferior to that of Daniel Day-Lewis from ""Last of the Mohicans.""  It was hard to buy into the conflicted image portrayed by Mel - something just did not work for me.  Also - the villain in this film was pretty bland and was hard to hate(he was just a bore).  Contrast that to the villains in ""Braveheart"", ""Last of the Mohicans"", ""Rob Roy"" where you could really get into disliking the bad guy.Like the Brits who object I also find myself doubting the whole plot line with the eeeevil Dragoon.  More like a vision of WWII and later than a vision from 200 years ago when chivalry was still in fashion.It was still an entertaining film and worth seeing.  But in my opinion there was a lot wrong with it.  Perhaps too much time and effort in the special effects and not enough effort on characterization development and story line.",10.0,Anonymous,History

The Carolina theater of the Revolutionary War brought to life,"Released in 2000 and directed by Roland Emmerich, ""The Patriot"" is stars Mel Gibson as peaceful South Carolina farmer Benjamin Martin who is driven to lead the Colonial Militia during the American Revolution after a wicked British colonel (Jason Isaacs) murders his son. The late Heath Ledger plays the older son with cutie Lisa Brenner playing his wannabe girlfriend. Rene Auberjonois is on hand as a pastor-soldier for the Militia while Tchéky Karyo appears as a French officer on the side of the Americans. Joely Richardson plays the sister of Martin's late wife, and potential love-interest.The basic plot was taken from 1965's ""Shenandoah,"" but there's more than enough difference for ""The Patriot"" to stand on its own. As my title blurb points out, the movie successfully brings the Revolutionary War to life, focusing on the Carolina campaign. Speaking of which, the South Carolina locations are excellent, particularly the Old Spanish Mission swamp encampment, shot at Cypress Gardens, Moncks Corner. The only part shot outside South Carolina was the British Headquarters, filmed at Stratford Hall Plantation, Virginia.I'm not a big Gibson fan and there are too many Hollywoodisms for my tastes but, other than that, ""The Patriot"" is an entertaining way to acquaint yourself with the Revolutionary War. Read some articles and books for more accurate details.The film runs 165 minutes (175 minutes, extended cut).GRADE: B",7.0,Anonymous,History
Inspiring if historically inaccurate epic,"being an Englishman I was slightly wary of the negative view of my fellow English in this 'war of independence' saga. However, although the English are portrayed as arrogant and aggressive oppressors, the film itself is a visual delight with strong characters that transcend the inaccuracies of English involvement in the New World.I thought Gibson was reasonable but it was really the staged battles that won it for me.The energy that is uniquely American came across vividly in this film which should have won more awards than it did.Well done Hollywood- you turned what could have been a very 'bloody'and 'serious' film into an enjoyable journey into the birth of America.",9.0,Anonymous,History
The revenge of Braveheart,"This time Mel Gibson takes his revenge against England. In ""Braveheart"" he was tragically killed by the cruel English, he fought for independence. This time, even if he pays a lot for his freedom, arrives at the end of the movie standing triumphantly against the defeated enemy. Surely, ""The Patriot"" presents some moments quite unbelievable, when Gibson kills the English troop with the help of his 10 years old boys (two children shoot better than professional soldiers?), but it is a good movie. Emmerich knows how to catch the attention of the spectator with fantastic fights, well orchestrated and very impressive. The actors are good, especially the newcomer Ledger, the evil Isaacs and the great Wilkinson. Great photography by Caleb Deschanel (he deserves an Oscar for his work).",7.0,Anonymous,History
Outstanding!!!But.....,"This is a VERY good film. Mel is perfectly cast as the troubled father trying to come to grips with his wife's passing, and with some terrible ghosts of his own. All the while trying to hold on to the most important thing in his life. His family. I went to see this fully expecting to see another jingoistic, sabrerattlin',AMERICAN movie. Thankfully, I was surprised. Mel and Heath sucked you into their lives and hung on.  The cliche's were there(cruel British commanders, traitors, cowards,etc)but they never pulled you too far off course. The battle scenes were terrifying and the supporting characters, though not, in some cases , well developed, they still worked for the film in a whole. I did however find the the final confrontation with the ""evil"" British colonel a little over done. There battle seemed better suited for a Lethal Weapon movie than a Revolutionary War epic. It seemed a little contrived and tacked on. So we can have one more cheer for the hero and satisfy our own need to see vengeance. Only a small negative note. I hope that the American goverment will give Roland Emmerich a citizenship now. After ID4 and now The Patriot, I think he deserves one.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"It's WAR people, real WAR","I liked this movie very much, This movie is one that every one should see and think about it really hard about how the USA got it's start and where it's going now. It's a sad fact about war, bad things are done by both sides and this movie tells you that. The major big battles in this movie really happened and pretty much as this movie shows them too.The actors portrayals of the characters were a very good performance maybe Mel Gibson's best to date. I really found Tom Wilkinson as General Cornwallis not just excellent, but for the most part historically accurate. His surrender at Yorktown sending his subordinate to surrender his subordinates sword, (I'm not giving the ending away here, that's how it really happened. Read a book!)And the battle fields scenes were so awesome, you could see the terror and bravery of the men on the firing line. You could even see a cannon ball flying around every so often, (the one that came right at the camera made me jump, I was sitting in the center front row, YIKES!!)In conclusion this movie reminds us we need to look at the past to see where the future is going.

Disgrace to cinema and American history.,"Not only is this movie consistently predictable (who'd have thought a fight to the finish between the good guy and the embodiment of evil at the end?) but it makes a mockery of US History.There is one obligatory villan who would never have found his way into the British army as an officer.  Then there is the depiction of the happy slave, an insult to the millions of Africans brought here and chains and whipped and raped by their ""masters."" Anachronisms abound, from what people to say to the weapons of war. The Patriot is what a historical epic directed by Ed Wood would have been like.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Felt manipulated,"This is a good movie, but the direction was contrived and the audience I felt was unabashadely manipulated . The sequence for instance where the youngest daughter finally speaks to her father ( Mel Gibson ) is excessively corny and predictable. Also the villain is so grotesquely evil , it is impossible to believe . No historian on earth would give an ounce of credit to this portrayal of a British Army officer . Now , there were instances of Hessian atrocities during this war ( these were German mercenaries hired by the British ) but the conduct of the British in this film is totally out of context . It may sound like I didn't like the film but I did , I just wish Mel Gibson didn't have to soft soap audiences with his own distortions of history . He is a great presence on film and his sometimes awful dialogue (not just in this movie) is not always his fault . I don't blame the British public from being angered over the callous treatment of an army that was not the great superior force it was portrayed to be. Thanks......",6.0,Anonymous,History

a well done historical caricature,"""The Patriot"" is quite an amazing mixture of the best and the worst in a movie. The acting is quite good. Mel Gibson is way better than in Braveheart as he does get to act and not just to do loud screaming, weapon waving and undergo physical and emotional torture. All of his children are excellent as well. And there is quite a bit of good humor and some impressive battle scenes.However the script is far too predictable and sooo terribly stereotypical and too Hollywoodish. There are a few emotionally overcooked episodes, especially each time Gibson is striken by another tragedy (brrr, and I thought ""Ransom"" was bad!)My biggest problem, however, is the unbelievable historical inaccuracy of this movie. Yea, yeah, I know , this is not a documentary and the director should be allowed an ""artistic license"". However, no matter what artistic interpretation of historical facts the director makes, he has to capture the spirit of the time. Otherwise we are treated to a fairy-tale, which is exactly what happened here. In fact the ""Patriot"" is a particularly superficial and shallow fairy-tale.Why did they have to demonize the British so much and present them as inhuman savages worthy of German Nazis? This was certainly not the case in reality and it was not the ""inhuman atrocities"" of the British Army that drove most Americans to fight in the Revolutionary War. Of course showing the Brits torch a church with the whole village locked inside is much more dramatic than trying to explain the whole ""taxation without representation"" thing! I am neither American nor British (in fact I am from Russia) but this film's treatment of the British seems very much like a slander.The treatment of slavery in the movie is totally idealistic and has nothing to do with reality. In fact I am surprised that they chose to set the movie in South Carolina which, of all the American states, is the one most responsible for perpetrating the abomination of slavery in America.What makes it really bad is that most young Americans are so ignorant of their own history that they are likely to accept the historical caricature of ""the Patriot"" for the real thing.Having said all of this, I have to confess that I rather enjoyed this movie. So go see it and then read a good history book afterwards!",7.0,Anonymous,History

A Roland Emmerich action movie set in a historical time period.,"Over the years, I've seen most of The Patriot (2000). Having now purposely sat through the entire thing (and the Extended Cut, no less), I can see parts of its appeal. Now, I'm not going to watch a Roland Emmerich movie for any kind of historical accuracy. That Emmerich set The Patriot during the Revolutionary War is merely a backdrop for over-the-top action sequences. Some of its political statements are cringeworthy now, but there's an amount of entertainment here that is hard to ignore. And that's what this movie is: entertainment.The star power in The Patriot is hard to ignore. Mel Gibson, Heath Ledger, Jason Isaacs, Chris Cooper, and Tom Wilkinson all deliver outstanding performances. In particular, the ""win at all costs"" Colonel William Tavington (Jason Isaacs) was a great motivator and foil for Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson) to avenge the losses he endured during the film. This subplot comes off as ridiculous in a historical film but works well for an action film. Fortunately, there are moments of humor to offset the brutal violence that runs throughout.However, with a film made with the hindsight of future historic events, there are several scenes that mostly just made me roll my eyes. While I'm sure there were individuals from the south who shared sentiments that were more in line with their northern countrymen, the whole ""we solved racism!"" segments are so corny as to detract from the movie as a whole. But again, there are a ton of tropes that would not be forgiven for a purely historical film but can mostly be shrugged off in the context of this action movie.A Roland Emmerich action movie set in a historical time period, I give The Patriot 3.5 stars out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Education is what we need!,"Having just seen The Patriot, I was disappointed in many of my fellow IMDb reviewers. A few, (e.g., David-546), I found did accurately reflect and identify the film's weaknesses. I generally do not mind films that are inaccurate since that is what I expect, but in this case, the inaccuracies spoiled the film and, unfortunately I agree with David that many will not believe this film to be substantially inaccurate. I understand and agree that to achieve great drama, films often need to portray history inaccurately but care must be taken. It seems to me that this film could not have been made if our education system was at all competent and confirms for me that our country is in dire need of major improvements. This movie is just another example giving evidence of how poorly most of us have been taught by our school systems. Isn't it interesting that Hollywood can not find a way to make a truly great film of this singularly most important part of our history. Calling Mr. Spielberg.Just for the record. I happen to be a fan of Mel Gibson and have always enjoyed his performances and he does a fine job in this film. It is the script and its message that is troubling. For example, we not only confuse the meaning of the Holocaust when we displace it in time, peoples, and location but we falsely attribute this horrific event and that is just wrong.",7.0,Anonymous,History

This movie is not a history lesson,"Let me first say I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It wasn't, in my opinion, Braveheart, but it was very entertaining. In reading some of the reviews of this movie, many people have found fault with the fact that it was historically inaccurate. I don't believe this movie was intended to be a documentary. Like so many fact based movies that preceded it, it was intended to be, plainly and simply, a MOVIE. If you want history, go to the library or the History Channel. I find it amusing that a great majority of novels, when they are made into movies, are changed so much [characters and plots changed, added or deleted] without, for the most part, people getting upset about the changes. Yet when a movie is based on actual incidents and/or characters, people tend to get upset that they may not be totally, historically accurate.

Exceptional Epic that Requires Right Intentions and Interpretations,"Having read a lot of comments on this movie, I have to admit that I felt confused because the criticism sometimes seems to cross the ""borderline of acceptance."" I am aware that someone may not like this movie, may see some serious flaws in it; however, it does not mean that the film lacks all possible merits. Let me, therefore, make a just analysis like all the commentators who assess Roland Emmerich's production objectively retaining a positive attitude.There is no need to say once again that THE PATRIOT is no history lesson. That fact appears to be unquestionable. I would move even further in this case saying that it seriously simplifies history, its significant period for America, the war which brought the country a dawn of independent existence. This historical inaccuracy not only refers to the factual errors but misinterpretation of that reality. Showing the British as wretched villains and American militia as heroes who have to escape and fight the absolute regime is a false picture that leads many viewers to a wrong perception of important aspects in the historic war. Let me mention here the character of Col. Tavington (Jason Isaacs) who appears to be absolutely evil and...who is the royal soldier, the English noble. As a matter of fact, from the psychological point of view, there are no such people who are absolutely good or absolutely evil. In this respect, if we analyze Benjamin Martin's (Mel Gibson) acts, he is totally justified when slaying those soldiers as, metaphorically speaking, he kills the army of evil people who bring only death or captivity (of course that was not the point in history). Therefore, those distortions in THE PATRIOT might make the film an inaccurate epic and a sort of ""easy going fairy tale"" for childish viewers. However, that moment does not end the analysis, does not hold the ""last word"" condemning the production entirely. What are the merits of the film?THE PATRIOT is a fine cinematic work. If you consider the stunning cinematography, flawless action, rich sets, strong storyline, impressive costumes and genuine performances, it is a movie that deserves attention. Here, I would like to mention Mel Gibson who does a very good job in the main role portraying a noble character, the southern farmer who does not own slaves, a good father who is on the verge of terrible acts caused by tragedy. Some even overrated his role as ""American Braveheart"" but there was some truth in that ""exaggeration."" Jason Isaacs also impressed me with his performance depicting his unrealistically cruel character and, I must admit that he really fits to that role. Heath Ledger is fine as the stubborn and a bit fanatical son, Gabriel Martin. Tom Wilkinson is memorable as cold hearted Charles Cornwallis. Female cast include terrific acting from Joely Richardson as Charlotte and Lisa Brenner as Anne. But, except for the artistic merits of the movie, THE PATRIOT has something more to offer.It is the film that truly addresses modern viewers conveying the significance of two most precious pearls that humans have, values that are much talked about in our times but usually distorted: family and peace. In most parts, the content appears to deal with war but stresses its gore, its monstrosity and the harm it does to humanity in general, attacking its core of healthy existence, the family. It makes the main character ask the question of importance, the choice between state and family, follow love to countrymen or love to the closest persons. He is bound to make critical decisions after experiencing the real gore of evil. The horror of war's effect on people that Benjamin Martin warns against during the assembly held in Charleston is beautifully depicted in two scenes for me being the key moments of the film. First, it is a shocking, perhaps most disturbing and indeed historically exaggerated scene when Col. Tavington orders his men to burn the church and people closed inside. Second, it is the moving scene when Benjamin's little daughter Susan bids him Goodbye. These two lead us to the gist of whom hatred, whom war attacks most: the good, the children, the peacemakers, the innocent. Those who prayed to God were killed by this world, the reality which is ruled by fire of hatred; those who loved their closest with childlike hearts were bound to face parting and fear of death.Yes, I am aware that a lot of commentators will not agree with my opinion on THE PATRIOT. Yet, I do not impose my viewpoint on anyone by any means to become preachy. All I wanted to say was: try to see it deeper, try to find a hidden pearl within the gray commonness. I rate the film 7/10: 2/10 its historical content but 9/10 its cinematic merits and message.Yes, Benjamin Martin seems to shout out loud like once William Wallace did: ""FREEDOM"". Yet, his message appears to go further: ""FREEDOM FOR FAMILY, FREEDOM BUILT IN PEACE"" being a father who strives for a happy smile on his child's face, for a peaceful, free heart with no more tears of parting.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Bloody but powerful,"The Patriot takes place during the American Revolutionary war against King George of England. Filmed entirely in South Carolina, per the credits, that provide a realistic background on which Emmerich painted the story.Mel Gibson as Benjamin Martin is a man who wants to eschew violence, knowing what the price is, and what it can do to your soul. This is usually a very good basic theme for films, because you see the person struggling against himself, and no one does it better than Gibson. He finds himself pushed headlong into something that he knows he should avoid, but cannot.His son Gabriel, played by Heath Ledger, wants to be like his Dad. Dad fears that his patriotic son will undergo the same fate as he. Dad loves his family of 7, and protects them fearlessly because he is a single parent.The battle scenes seem realistic for the time. I think the costume design and direction was terrific, adding to the bloody realism. That's the one negative from the film - it's in your face blood - left, right, center, back, forward. Maybe that was necessary to impart the stark realism, I am not sure. But it is there, so be warned.There are not too many happy moments in this film, and the ones there are bittersweet. There are many sad moments where you can't believe what is happening. Hollywood provides a Hollywood ending, no fear. But still, you walk away stunned and saddened at the whole somewhat tragic story.Patriot won 3 Academy awards, and is a fine picture. It's only the excess blood and somewhat long story at 2 3/4 hours, that makes me give it only a 7/10. The acting is top notch, as is the story, direction, and costume design.

Long winded but not unworthy,"If you are not an American and/or an American history buff, you are sure to think this movie is a tad too long and laboured. This is not to say that the piece is unskillful or without merit. It certainly is. Direction, cinematography and the sheer grand scale of the battle scenes make it well worth the ticket price. Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger manage their roles tolerably well, but in the end are let down by the extreme length of the film and cannot sustain our interest.

"Great Entertainment, a pure adrenaline rush of a film!!!!!","Frankly I have been disgusted with the majority of the comments about this movie. I am an Australian and I thought this movie was great, not just because it starred two Australians, not that you can really call Mel Gibson an Australian, but because it taught me what hardships the Continental Army went through to beat the redcoats, wo at the time were the best infantry on the planet.People have complained about i's historical accuracy, and no-one said the film was even meant to be historically accurate. Actually, the battles at Camden, which Gibson and Ledger watch from a house, Cowpens, the battle where Tavington was killed and the movie-ending Siege of Yorktown were all real battles and really did take place.This was a great movie, and it should be praised for being the epic that it was!!!!!!",,Anonymous,History

If its pro-American, and it shows Americans fighting our enemies, then the libs cry foul. Their favorite battle cry always revolves around that common destroyer of speech...racism. Many people writing comments about this movie apparently have a 'problem' with how the blacks were treated in this film. Hmmm, one guy spent 5 pages in IMDb commenting on the so-so historical truths about slaves and the American Revolution. The facts remain the facts here folks, we Americans got rid of the redcoats. Thats the bottom line here. History has been written much about that war. This is a movie and attempts to entertain people. Thats it. Not every movie has to have a ""bad white men"" ""good blacks"" ""good indians"" message. This movie was very entertaining, good scenery, good costumes, and a good storyline.

the way that leads to freedom,"This is the film-maker of ""Independence Day"", Roland Emmerich who made this historic adventures movie which the action takes place in the eighteenth century during the Independence War of the United States. Emmerich manages rather well from this epic movie. Anyway, the result is better than the conceited ""Independence Day"". This is a movie rather well made and careful, especially at the level of the (bloody) sequences fight.There's also an honorable performance that owes a lot to Mel Gibson, brave and lucid when it's necessary. Heath Ledger, eager to join the army so as to defend his country against the English soldiers. On the other hand, Tchéky Karyo isn't equal to his role. I'm under the impression that he was hired only to make the spectator remember that the USA gained their independence with a little help from the French. Otherwise, he isn't really equal to the performance and he's there just to be decorative.It's also obvious that the screenplay was inspired of several movies. You think about ""the Last of the Mohicans"" when Gibson sets an ambush in order to set his elder son free. But also ""Robin Hodd"", and above all ""Braveheart"". However, the screenplay doesn't succeed in hiding a certain manicheism: sadistic English soldiers face Americans settlers filled with good feelings. You can also notice a shy but pointless presence of humor. At last, you find in this movie, some beloved subjects to American movies: strained relationships between a father and his sons but an unexpected event will bring them closer (here, it's war). But also, the difficult choice to join the army, the question of the honor and revenge.This movie only relates a minor episode of the Independence War.

It's no Braveheart . . .,"It's no Gladiatior either, although all three movies share a suspicious amount of plot points . . . peace loving father, loses loved ones, seeks revenge, lots of close combat fighting . . .

It may not be as good as Braveheart or Gladiator, but Braveheart is one of the best movies - if not the best - of the '90s, and Gladiator is one of the best movies of the last few years, so not being quite as good as those is hardly a major strike.Despite the lulls in the action, and despite just a few too many minor plot lines, The Patriot has some marvellous battle scenes, memorable characters, and at least one plot twist that surprised me.

kindergarten history,"Samuel Johnson was right when he identified patriotism as the last refuge of a scoundrel, and the proof is in this cartoon call to arms from the makers of 'Independence Day' and the Hollywood remake of 'Godzilla'. The film is a bubblegum whitewash of early American history, with all the misguided crowd-pleasing appeal of an Armed Forces recruitment ad, casting Mel Gibson as a conscientious objector (in screen vernacular always the next worse thing to an outright sissy) who rediscovers the moral rewards of deep commitment during the Revolutionary War, mostly by slaughtering half the Redcoats in New England. Screenwriter Robert Rodat waves the flag more stridently here than in his previous 'Saving Private Ryan', helping Gibson to shed his pacifism by presenting him with an adversary (British colonel Jason Isaacs) so evil and sadistic that even his own troops despise him (and later impaling the villain directly onto the Stars and Stripes, in a particularly grisly bit of low-brow propaganda).The story invites obvious comparisons with Gibson's own Oscar winning 'Braveheart', but despite the quality of the production (and the transparent self-importance of its epic 160+ minute running time) the film is still little more than a prestigious vendetta drama, on the same emotional and intellectual level as any Charles Bronson 'Deathwish' scenario. Ace cinematographer Caleb Deschanel provides the fabulous scenery, and then newcomer Heath Ledger valiantly takes up the matinée idol torch passed to him by his on-screen father (and fellow Aussie heartthrob) Gibson.",3.0,Anonymous,History
The Patrionator,"Quick Name one reason why TV is cool. Ok How about this? It lets you see movies like The Patriot without having to buy a ticket. Sure, you'll miss a bit of the R-rated carnage, but hey, that's why we have imagination. It's why Quentin Tarantino released the pull-way version of the ear-ectomy in Reservoir Dogs instead of the alternate version that actually showed Michael Madsen's razor work. The mind is the real stage, the real screen.The Revolutionary War will probably never work well on the Hollywood screen. There are several reasons for this, all of which would require more space to properly examine than is available here. Suffice it to say that, despite its crucial role in the history of America, the Revolutionary War is simply too quaint to sell major tickets; best to leave it to PBS, maybe. Pigtailed men running around in knee breeches, marching in rigorous order and firing flintlock rifles that require minutes to load between shots doesn't exactly put us on the edge of our seats. But neither does the scowling, bellowing Mel Gibson, even as he hacks his way through a platoon of Redcoats like Toshiro Mifune with a tomahawk, avenging the rather brutal and unnecessary death (in terms of the story) of his youngest son at the hands of the British. The Patriot will, and probably should, irritate anyone with a reasonable knowledge of history, the references to which, in this film, skip off reality like a flat stone across water. The War of Independence really does deserve better. It was far, far more interesting than its pro-forma representation here.So, is there nothing good to say? Well, damn near. However, The Patriot did render a superb villain in Jason Isaacs' Colonel William Tavington and it is around this somewhat trumped up spirit of darkness that the film really orbits. The Tavington character radiates the same cold light that emanated from what is possibly one of the very greatest portraits of nastiness ever brought to the screen: Jack Palance's gunfighter Jack Wilson in Shane. The fact that Tavington was forced by the powers to act more like an equestrian Reinhard Heydrich than an English gentleman of the era betrays the film's lack of confidence in its own historical foundation. The Brits pulled some funky stuff during the Revolution. Armed conflict tends to bring such things out in us. But atrocities as heinous as were ascribed to the British in The Patriot never occurred. Director Roland Emmerich is German. Perhaps he has residual issues over the outcome of World War Two. The historical person on which the Tavington character was obviously based, Colonel Banastre Tarleton, actually did command British forces in the Carolinas during the War of Independence, and was certainly interesting enough to warrant a film of his own. Tarleton was not the near-satanic presence that Tavington embodies, in fact quite the opposite. It's safe to say that if the boyish Tarleton, and not Jeb Stuart, had been commanding Lee's cavalry at Gettysburg, he would not have been dashing about stealing wagons instead of shadowing the Union army. The outcome of the battle, not to mention history, might well have been different. Still, the Tavington character is the one element in the film that really resonates. Maybe The Patriot should be re-released under the title, Bad Dragoon.Rene Auberjonois, whose alienated, unflinching Constable Odo was probably the best thing about the otherwise moribund Babylon Five rip, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, and who played the courageous reverend in The Patriot, also played the young George Washington in a 1974 episode of PBS' N.E.T. Playhouse, ""Portrait of the Hero as a Young Man"" depicting Washington's participation in the opening actions of the French and Indian War, when he commanded colonial militia under the British. For those wondering why Mel Gibson's Benjamin Martin refused to answer his son's (Heath Ledger) repeated question: `What happened at Fort Wilderness?', I may have an answer. There was, of course, no such historical place. If the definitive authority on such matters, the eminent 19th century historian Francis Parkman fails to reference it, then, it was never there. However, there is a Disney resort of that name in Orlando. Mel was probably embarrassed to admit that he overpaid for his cabin.",,Anonymous,History
Where's the giant lizard?,"I can't believe it. Are Devlin and Emmerich going legit on us? Well, no, not really. Finally, a movie with more patriotism and flag-waving than Independance Day (or ID4 to those with short attention spans), I didn't think that was possible.This is Mel Gibson's American stop on his 'Free the Planet From the English' tour. Let's see, we have Scotland, America... now if only he could free us Canadians from the tyranical rule of the monarchy! Now that's a movie! Him and Bob and Doug McKenzie, drinking beer and fighting the English! He's an Aussie, you know?Okay, I'll try to control myself. Mel plays a cheeky fellow who gets mad and goes on a killing spree (what, again? how many killing sprees can this guy go on?). That's what we want to see, and that's what we get, so in that sense the movie works. Sure, the fight scenes aren't as entertaining as Braveheart or as thrilling as Last of the Mohicans, the battles aren't as well choreographed as they could be, but it's fun non the less. I know it's the period, but there is something very dull about a bunch of soldiers standing in a row waiting for bullets to hit them (some of them just looked sleepy, ""Oh, is it my turn to fall down now?""). Almost hard to believe wars were ever fought like that.Col. Tavington (Isaacs) is a lot of fun as the villian, and I hope to see more of him (I only remember him from Event Horizon and a bit part in Armegeddon). He's a nasty little poofter, yes he is. Mel hates him because he slowly roasts and eats Mel's children before his very eyes (no, he didn't do that. He's evil, just not Mike Tyson evil). Mel gets revenge though when he beats him to death with an American flag (again, not quite, but almost). The rest of the performances were all cardboard. When there wasn't a battle going on I didn't care much for what was happening on screen. Sorry, it just didn't stir my emotions, move me, or do much of anything to engage me, not matter how hard it tried.This was written by Robert Rodat of Saving Private Ryan fame? I guess Ryan was one of those rare cases where having a dozen ghost writers actually worked, because this has none of the emotional impact of Ryan.I know, I'm making it sound much worse than it is.

The last reviewer has it wrong.,Certainly the story has quite an American slant but it does not depict all the Americans as being good and the english evil. Some British officers clearly have trouble following the orders to burn homes and kill innocents. Benjamin Martin is based on Francis Marion and is depicted as the immoral and ruthless soldier That Marion was. He savagely kills the english soldiers as do many of his recruits. Tavington is based on the British Col. Banastre Tarleton who was by all accounts a a ruthless butcher himself who was known to kill surrendering soldiers. The film does take many libertys with facts but if Americans make a film about the American Revolution I would say that is is okay if we portray the British as the bad guys because quite frankly...they were.,7.0,Anonymous,History

It's been around a year since I last saw it, so forgive me if I seem a little rusty.I've read enough literary sources on the American War of Independence to direct my own film on this topic (*laughs*) but I just couldn't dislike this film. I guess many British viewers perceived it as a follow-up to 'Braveheart' and, therefore, a swipe at them and their history...again. It seems strange though: the British are shown winning enough battles in 'The Patriot' and, if you recall, director Roland Emmerich is German. Now who were Britain's biggest and most trusted allies during the War of Independence...yes, Germany! Let's not forget either, Mel Gibson is Australian!!'The Patriot' is concerned more with family values than war itself, but that doesn't strictly mean that there is any lack of bloodshed. The battle scenes are gory, don't get me wrong, but satisfyingly action-packed. There is also a worthy degree of authenticity here: the accents seem polished enough, if not a little too polished, the costumes are splendid, and the colonial scenery/architecture is impressive. It also seems unusual and refreshing that the film focuses more upon militia skirmishes rather than full-blown battles.Mel Gibson's performance is great too. His character has many facets: caring, romantic, warm, loyal to his family, and almost comical at times. However, this is contrasted by his more brutal, barbaric and blood-thirsty side which we see in battle. Gibson manages to pull each and every one of these facets off in a decent enough manner.While historically speaking the film isn't totally true to life ( - but then again, what is?) it will keep most watchers entertained.

"Rousing, vigorous, with the strength and conviction of Mel Gibson's performance and the realism of the battle sequences. ***1/2 (out of four)","THE PATRIOT / (2000) ***1/2 (out of four)""The Patriot"" is a rousing, vigorous Revolutionary War epic from the view point of a family full of vengeance and strong wills. Mel Gibson reprises his ""Braveheart"" characteristics for a production that shares many common factors, such as frequent and graphic battle sequences that are persuasive, personal, and tragic. He stars as a widower named Benjamin Martin, who contains fond memories of his late wife and is raising several children on a South Carolina estate in 1776. Of course, he is haunted by deep secrets in his past and is an expert on the French and Indian war. King George's taxation without representation is the subject of conflict here, and although Martin believes the policy to be unjust, he wants nothing to do with supporting war with the British.Benjamin's oldest son, Gabriel (Heath Ledger in an overzealous performance), goes against his father's strong intentions and joins the rebellion by enlisting as a soldier in the war. Soon a wounded Gabriel returns to his father's plantation as a battle occurs in the front of their livelihood, and the diabolically cruel Col. William Tavington (Jason Isaacs) orders the novice solider to be hanged. In fury one of Benjamin's other children (Gregory Smith from ""Small Soldiers"") is killed for interrupting the process, compliments of Tavington.Naturally this action triggers an impulse within Benjamin whose rage causes him to switch to battle mode and, with the help of his two younger sons, ambushes the party in charge of Gabriel's hanging. Benjamin then takes up arms against the British and is given the command of a militia. With the help of French warrior Jean Villeneuve (Tcheky Karyo), he marks a full-throated revenge against the man who killed his son, and who changed his previous life.The film is fond of bridging on emotions such as love, patriotism and betrayal. These emotions are true to the story, and relate well with the audience. There is also some mild comic relief, revolving around simple-minded misunderstandings and character traits. Mel Gibson's ""Braveheart"" similarly portrayed such humor to ease the tension. But in a movie with as much human depth and tragic occurrences as ""The Patriot,"" why would the filmmakers want to induce chuckles. They only decrease the seriousness of the subject matter-although the production is careful not to tread over its head in laughs and foolishness.I did see a few excessively familiar clichés within the material of ""The Patriot""; how many times do we really need to see a father raising his children on his own because his spouse passed away a few years earlier. In lesser films I can see where their dim-minded writers would purchase this concept from the marketplace of customary clichés, but when I witness this particular mechanical abstraction in a movie with as much power as this, it is really shameful and sticks out like a sore thumb.What really propels ""The Patriot"" from being a good movie to being a great movie is the strength and conviction of Mel Gibson's performance and the realism of the battle sequences. Especially in war epics, Gibson is capable of portraying characters of flamboyance and passion, while at the same time can drive the film's many action scenes into excitement and thrills; not many actors can do that, but Mel Gibson can.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Wasted effort,"I was hoping that this movie would be an American Revolution ""Braveheart"", but no such luck.  This film was simply a load of boring schmaltz.

Superior to Braveheart,"I know the strong opinion of most who've written here regarding this film, and perhaps I'm chancing my already tenuous reputation as a reviewer to say it, but all the same I'm willing to put this on the line:  The Patriot is one of the better historical fiction movies of the past ten years.Is it fastidiously historically accurate?  No.  Characters use standard American English accents, and some modern colloquialisms are present. Slavery, which was a fact of life in the colonies, is much played down--perhaps in our politically correct times, this is inevitable.  But the makers of The Patriot are not striving to create a period piece in which every bit of historical minutiae is perfect--rather, they seek to create a certain mood about a period of our history.Mel Gibson gives one of the better performances of his career, as a widower and father whose former bloody past haunts him.  All he hopes is to see himself and his family spared from war--alas, the war comes literally to his doorstep.  To his credit as an actor, Gibson is perfectly credible in a role that requires him to go from a gentle family man willing to nurse Redcoats back to health, to a gore-drenched Colonial nemesis repeatedly hacking into a British soldier's body with a tomahawk--all within the space of about twenty minutes.This film is superior to Braveheart largely because, as an action-oriented film, there is less posturing and more action.  Simple men are not usually in the habit of giving rousing speeches; Gibson's character does not.  His men stick to him and trust him not for his fine words before a battle, but for his consistent actions during one.There is definitely some character typecasting:  Our Hero, the Love Interest, the Noble Villain, the Ruthless Villain, the Doomed Young Lovers, etc., and the movie has taken some knocking in the press because of it. However, I challenge these detractors to name a single classic work which does not employ such stock characters.  Shakespeare, Chaucer, and the Italian commedia dell'arte style are immediate examples.  No, Shakespeare this ain't.  That doesn't mean it isn't a worthwhile movie.If you want to revel in the thoughts of the idealists who forged the Revolution, rent 1776.  If you're curious about what it must have been like for the common men, the workers and traders and farmers of the Colonies and their families, to become involved in a war that was not of their choosing, you should see The Patriot.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Not That Bad,"This film was pretty much what I expected. If I want accurate history, I will watch the History Channel or a PBS Documentary. Jeez! People this is a Hollywood film. Of course it's not going to be accurate. When did films become responsible for accurate history? This is a historic work of fiction. Nothing more. For what it is, I thought it was okay. Not nearly as bad, as I have read on this site. It's entertainment. It is what it is. Nothing more. Sure maybe Mel is a tad self indulgent, but so what. So was Orson Wells, so is Steven Spielberg, and a slew of other directors. With this much hatred for a film I thought maybe Pam Anderson was in it. Now that's a film that needs to be dismissed.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Wow!,"Kudos to Mel Gibson, he had me hooked from the start with his realistic portrayal of American Revolutionaries. I know very little about the American War of Independence because the English School system does not place great emphasis upon it but I can see that he has perfectly captured those who valiantly fought against the English. Why, from the opening sequence I can see that this is a perfect portrayal. A pacifist man and his children (who can all read and write whilst working on the sizeable farm) along with his freed African-soontobeAmerican workers all go off to fight the demonic English with only four racists Americans in sight (all minor parts. I won't try to count the racist English). Gibson's character is perfect, a bit angry at times but perfectly well adjusted to modern society. No less than a miracle for a man supposed to have lived about two hundred years ago.The portrayal of the Americans is wishful thinking and the portrayal of the English is point-blank racist. But that doesn't matter because they're English with their bad teeth and besides you can't be racist to white people. This villifying of the English in this film is typical not just of Mel Gibson's work, nor of that of American cinema in general but of the entire American culture. The only English character's that are portrayed in American celluloid are either there to be mocked, killed or play the part of Kato to the American Green Hornet.",,Anonymous,History
"Not the best Gibson film, but a classic still.","`The Patriot' is a great film with a little bit of everything. The acting is good, especially from Mel Gibson. The special effects are pretty recent, making for a great battle scene or two. It's historically accurate, so it's even educational to a certain degree, and it's very authentic feeling. It's not Gibson's best film, and there's a boring moment or two, but overall this is a great film that I highly recommend.The most noticeable thing about this film is the authentic feel it gives off from start to finish. The costumes and buildings and sailboats and war tactics and everything else are very impressive, and really do the job of transporting you to the Revolutionary War. The film was shot on location in South Carolina, and there are some really beautiful scenery shots. I hear the costumes were all copies from authentic ones lent from the Smithsonian, and they certainly seem like it. They acting isn't always of the best quality, but it does make you feel like you're really seeing the past through this film.This is basically a war film, but the war was very well chosen. The reason for war films is to make you realize how terrible war is so that you will be educated enough to avoid them should that power ever come to you. It has to do with the old saying `If we forget history, we are doomed to repeat it.' The problem with most war films is that they are not very entertaining, since really they should not be. `The Patriot' does function as a War film, especially since it puts an emphasis on how negatively it affects family, but it also seems to function as your basic tearjerker as well, and it does pretty well in both departments.There are four scenes that really go for the tears in this film, and I think I have cried during all four at one time or another. One especially involving the main character's daughter gets me every time. There is a bit of good humor now and then, but mostly there's just an overwhelming sense of dread the whole film that builds up to these horribly emotional scenes. It's very enjoyable, if you like that kind of thing.Jason Isaacs plays the bad guy in this film, and he does a terrific job of it. He is ruthless and terrible and you hate him so much that it really makes the movie important for you. His performance is very noticeable, along with Gibson's, though Heath Ledger's may have been over-rated.The battles are great, utilizing the best combination of extras and CGI to be seen for a while. They do get moderately bloody, but that's to be expected in a war film, and there isn't any language or sex at all. Though there are too few battles for this to be called an action movie, but when it does come it comes in spades. The only real problem with this movie is that it is a bit on the long side, and tends to drag in one or two areas. These spots aren't horrible, though, and don't take away from the rest of the film. If you aren't into the whole emotional aspects of movies, it's still good as long as you don't mind a few additional boring scenes. I would defiantly recommend this movie to you, whatever you expect in movies, as long as it isn't comedy.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Shots of farther than 20ft with a flintlock pistol are very possible. Flintlock rifles were the sniper rifles of the time and extremely accurate. None of the shots shown in the film were impossible.

Pretty good epic by summer flick standards,"A fairly good story in search for a better director than the one they were given, but despite that, it's still pretty good. Luckily it's no Godzilla and no ID4!Mel and Heath are great, and so is the rest of the cast. Spike Lee had some problems with black representation. It is an extremely PC look at a rather un-PC time period. All those rednecks I would doubt take on to a black man so easily, but then again, we knew this wasn't 100% historically accurate.There's enough story, explosions, fights, drama, love, etc. to entertain you. Never gets too slow, but you do catch yourself thinking they could of cut 15 minutes from it and lose nothing!It brings up one really good point: there need to be more films about this exciting time period in the history of our country and certainly films that go more thought provoking and historically epic in its arch.Bring them on!",7.0,Anonymous,History
Hollywood at its worst,"I went into the movie theater without knowing that the director of ""The Patriot"" was Roland Emmerich. I wish I only knew... now I wouldn't feel bad for giving my money to this kind of movie.""The Patriot"" is, by all accounts, Roland Emmerich's worst film. And I have seen Godzilla, Independence Day, and the decent Stargate... well ok, almost decent.Seriously, Emmerich is a hack, and it's depressing to see that his movies still make money despite getting worse and worse. Not that this movie is bad in every way... there is a pretty good photography, although nothing stunning. That's about it.

High Camp,"If one good thing came out of this production, it's that Mel Gibson met Caleb Deschanel, DP, and the two would go on to make THE PASSION OF THE Christ. But this one was strictly a paycheck effort. Columbia Pictures needed a tent-pole of the summer of 2000. Mel Gibson needed to pay off that Hamptons beach house, or put the finishing touches on his private chapel. 25 million dollars only goes so far these days.With Emmerich, you pretty much know what to expect. Something along the lines of a low-rent Bruckheimer production, but with more cheese. Emmerich is going to put Leon Rippy in all of his movies. I thought it was funny how most of the British officers are either wig-wearing fags or stiff as cardboard martinets, with the exception of Isaacs. Those eyes burn with intensity! The man could easily become an international superstar.In war, the terms ""good/evil"" do not have any application. In war, especially fighting a war where you live, you kill or get killed. But a lot of the action scenes here are awfully contrived. The plot has to go from A, to B, to C, so if you want reality, watch PBS. This movie is fairly entertaining, but it's a work of fiction. Any Englishman who professes to be offended by this movie, is giving the movie far too much credit. I give the movie points for Isaacs, and for the scene when Gibson weeps with unbearable sadness when Ledger dies before his eyes.",,Anonymous,History
"Ok but far,far to long and patronising.","I have often wondered what the German people must think when they watch the WW2 film that make the Americans out to be such wonderfull people and the German soldiors to be the absolute epitemy of evil.

First there was Braveheart,which incidently i thought was brilliant and now we have the Patriot which comes nowhere near Braveheart. The Only comparison i can make is that they both make they English out to be complete bastards. I suppose i am slightly clouded in my judgement of patriot because of it's anti English stance so maybe you should not take to much notice of what i think of the film. As for the film let me start by saying it's not to bad. It is entertaining but it is far too long. It could have been cut by at least an hour to make it more comfortable to watch . It also has to many sentimental moments that are quite patronising at times but that is only to be expected from Hollywood. The big plus point about the movie is the special affects during the battle scenes. At one point you watch the flight of a cannonball and the distruction it does,which is one of the best special affects i have ever seen.

Long and Draggy but Not Very Bad Movie,"I won't be talking about the historical background, as I'm not qualified for that. However, the movie as a whole is much worse than ""Braveheart"" (which, by the way, not as fantastic as people and critics say).The story is too long and draggy. I think the director needs to cut some more unnecessary scenes. He did cut some already, but it's not enough. I couldn't believe that he's the same director who did ""Stargate"" and ""Independence Day"", although his latest movie (""Godzilla"") is also quite disappointing.The acting is not that good, except for Jason Isaacs, Gregory Smith and some of the kids. Mel Gibson seems to suffer ""Kevin Costner"" syndrome -- too confident and too heroic (blame it on the scripts). Heath Ledger is no better and needs to learn more from his on-screen younger brother.The music sounds to cheesy, maybe that's because the director puts too many over-dramatic moments. It's even more melodramatic than ""Titanic"".At least the movie is not a very bad movie. I could still enjoy it. And I would enjoy it even more if only the movie were shorter.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Very enjoyable Hollywood blockbuster.,"Benjamin Martin(Mel Gibson) has a dark, shady past which he dearly wants to forget. Being a widower with seven children to care for helps him to do that very thing, but when his son Gabriel(Heath Ledger) signs up for the army to battle the Brits in the American Revolution, it's not long before events go awry, resulting in a family tragedy...When Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich(producer and director respectively of such films as Independence Day) decided to do this film, they set out to make it a ""really beautiful movie"". If asked whether they had succeeded, the answer would be a semi-yes. It's not that this film isn't great, it is, it's just that what we have here is a Hollywood blockbuster beefed up with a decent plot and some good character development.You won't be surprised when Mel turns in a performance that's as charismatic and captivating as ever. The treat here is Heath Ledger's star turn as Gabriel. Ledger hasn't ""ditched the accent"" as promised, but that doesn't matter, because here he has made his character someone you really care about. In ""10 Things I Hate About You"", he seemed promising, and now, in The Patriot, he dislays his full potential.There's ample CGI usage on show here, a real standout being the fabulous recreations of whole towns. Of course, the entertaining battles are also effects-heavy and there's an amazing sequence where an in-motion cannonball takes up the whole screen for a split second and then proceeds to remove an unfortunate soldier's head. Exhilirating stuff, and guaranteed to make the audience jump.It's no wonder that Spike Lee was getting all hot under the collar about the movie's script turning a blind eye to the treatment of blacks during this period in history. It was the 1700s, after all, so it's no mere historical inaccuracy to have American Southereners(!) talking about racial equality. It's just plain unrealistic Hollywood nonsense, and badly affects the film's believability.The Brits are made out here to be real meanies, committing atrocities within the film that didn't even happen in the real war. Thankfully, this works for the film, because it's refreshing to have a baddie that you really hate(Jason Isaacs in a cold-blooded performance) instead of someone pathetically weak like Joaquin Phoenix's Commodus.The final thing to be said about this film is that it has a richly sentimental feel to it. Mercifully, the emotional scenes never reach mawkish heights, but there's still a fair bit of heart string pulling about. That said, Emmerich compensates for the sentimentality by throwing in a good number of moments chock-a-block with gore, which is fair enough.Rating:4 out of 5",8.0,Anonymous,History

The Patriot is a strong period drama with dynamic characters and gripping circumstances.,"The Patriot (2000) is a movie I recently rewatched on Tubi. The storyline follows a farmer with a history of fighting against Native Americans who is initially reluctant to join the fight during the American Revolution. However, when a British officer commits heinous acts against his son, the farmer is compelled to take up arms.Directed by Roland Emmerich (Independence Day), the film stars Mel Gibson (Mad Max), Heath Ledger (The Dark Knight), Jason Isaacs (Harry Potter), Joely Richardson (Nip/Tuck), and Chris Cooper (American Beauty).This is one of those period pieces where you can predict the general trajectory of the story, but the journey remains compelling. The cast is well-chosen, and their chemistry throughout is excellent. The father-children dynamics are particularly well-developed and add emotional weight to the narrative. The film's depiction of the era, from the settings to the costumes and props, is immersive and draws you into its universe. The shootouts and action sequences are well-executed, providing a solid dose of intensity.In conclusion, The Patriot is a strong period drama with dynamic characters and gripping circumstances. I'd score it a 7.5/10 and strongly recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,History

"Too Broad, Too Cliche","This is one of those films that you feel you have to see.  For those of you with discriminating taste in film, I'm letting you in on a secret: You don't have to see this.This is a film for a mass audience appeal, not for those of us who want our history and action served to us with a touch of humility and a dash of realism.  This film attempts to capture the feel of two superb films: Braveheart and Saving Private Ryan.  While both were brilliant, and at times understated, this film is never allowed to be either.  Robert Rodat's script is average fair, borrowing heavily from Ryan, Braveheart and Last of the Mohicans.  This script is not terrible, but it is not a stroke of genius. It lacks depth but is full of breadth, trying to do too much in just under three hours.Still, this movie could have faired better under the supervision of a better director.  Roland Emmerich, who in MHO has not made a good film since Stargate, bungles any of the chance Gibson or Ledger, or even Jason Issacs might have to make this film a classic.  He paces the film poorly, does not allow his characters to become anything more than catalysts for special effects, and leaves the audience wondering if the Brittish were truly that evil.If you liked U-571 instead of Das Boot, then this might be the film for you. But if you are looking for a classic, go see Gladiator, wait for August 29th for Braveheart on DVD, or purchase Last of the Mohicans.

"Great movie, just don't use it for your history homework","""The Patriot"" is a superb movie set in South Carolina during the American Revolution. Although the characters (with the exception of Lord Cornwallis and references to King George III, George Washington, and General Gates) the events, locations, lifestyle, and details are mostly accurate. Benjamin Martin, while not an actual character himself, is the epitome of those militia leaders who fought in South Carolina in the Revolution, such as Francis Marion, Andrew Pickens, and Thomas Sumter. As a native South Carolinian and lifelong resident of Carolina, I was deeply appreciative that the film was not set in New England. The Revolution began in New England, but the vast majority of it occurred in the South, especially in the Carolinas. The battles mentioned in the movie, such as Charleston and Camden (the biggest British victory of the war b/c of General Gates's ignorance) are real places that are still beautifully maintained as historical sites today. The final battle of the movie is loosely based on the battle of Cowpens. The scenery and locations in the movie are incredibly accurate, having mostly been filmed in South Carolina. The weaponry, tactics, uniforms, architecture, and other details are very accurate. However, there are a few things that I noticed are incorrect:1. At the beginning of the movie when the family rides over a hill to Charleston; there are no hills of any kind near Charleston or anywhere in the low country of SC.2. Again, there are no hills from which to leap down onto a road and ambush the British from.3. The fact that Benjamin Martin's slaves aren't slaves but paid freemen is incredibly unlikely. No slave holder at that time, even the historical figures that Martin is based, on would have done that.4. Tavington is a green dragoon, but real green dragoons wore green, not red (hence the name)5. The Native Americans that Martin killed in the past were indeed the Cherokee (not the Mohawk as Deagleman's review said; they lived in New York), although there was never a Fort Wilderness6. There were no French in South Carolina to help the militia7. The huge victories Martin won are unrealistic; the real fighters such as Francis Marion literally fired two shots and ran, they did not eliminate whole convoys or fire 8 guns 5 times in 2 minutes. However, Marion and his cohorts did employ a number of clever escapes.8. During the Revolution, the Americans still had British accents; there was no difference between the way they talked9. South Carolina was the only state during the Revolution that did not allow African-Americans, slaves or not, to serve in its militia or regular army. Occum would not have been allowed to fight. He also wouldn't have been granted freedom for his service even if he wasn't in South Carolina, because freedom was only granted for service with the regulars. However, there are accounts of slaves fighting for or alongside their masters with the militia either in exchange for freedom on different terms or just because they were told to.In conclusion, the message of this movie is one that is distinctly American, one of hardships, loyalty and sacrifice (as well as really cool fight scenes and some great lines, particularly by Monsieur Villeneuve). In addition, the movie is also careful to point out two of the most little-know facts:1. Slaves were still kept in large quantities, particularly in Sotuh Carolina, despite the Declaration of Indepence's ""all men are created equal"", as a result, some slaves fought for the British instead of the colonists for their freedom2. It can be argued that the American Revolution was begun in the North, waged in the South, and won by the French""The Patriot"" is a fabulous movie with a breath-taking performance by Mel Gibson, Heath Ledger, and Jason Isaacs. I highly advise you watch it, whether you are a history buff, a Southerner, a Yankee, someone from another country, or just somebody who likes great action and war movies.",9.0,Anonymous,History

However, it makes me laugh that Britain thinks the filmmakers owe their country an apology. This was a movie, my friends.  The Revolution happened, but that was long ago.

And so I have to admit that it's a three hour movie during which I hardly ever looked at my watch. The fighting scenes were exciting and authentic, Mel Gibson acted the same as in all his previous films, the screenwriter put in some lovely humorous scenes, and the story - surprise, surprise! - was not always predictable: It was more ""cruel"" for the viewer than the story in other mainstream movies. Entertainment factor: 9/10Did you notice that with landscapes the camera always started with the same move? First filming at a rather low level and then moving up. That shows that director Emmerich lacks ideas also in his newest movie. (It wasn't much better with ""Independence Day"".) Quality factor: 2/10Together that makes a rating of 6 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Good bit of film,"I really enjoyed this movie.  I was expecting something exactly like Braveheart, but it really wasn't.  Mel Gibson's character has no real desire to fight, even thought the reluctance is there.  The themes are similar, however.  Regardless, very well done film with good performances all round (esp. Gibson).  Not nearly as pro-American as other Roland Emmerich movies which was good, considering I'm not American :) (although the portrayal of the British seemed a bit stretched).  I never really saw it as American vs. British, but rather a personal struggle with the war as a backdrop.  The title is a bit misleading, IMO.I recommend people go see it.Woz",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Another Braveheart? No, but not a bad try.","I went to see The Patriot with some trepidation; could MelGibson match the directing and acting of Braveheart? The answer, unfortunately, was no. However, he didn't do abad job by any means. The film is impressive, with all ofthe leads giving solid performances. The battles are spectacular; usually CG (computer generated) extras, suchas were used here instead of armies of real actors, giveme problems. Here, though, they were unobtrusive and realistic. Of course, being a very picky fellow, I had problems with thefilm. Where Braveheart was very Hollywood in parts, ThePatriot was so in spades. Be warned: slow-motion sequences set to swelling orchestras abound. Emotionalmanipulation is overwhelming. The film is fundamentallypredictable. On the other hand, it looks so good and does agood enough job of keeping us involved that I for one amwilling to partially forgive that. 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Braveheart 1776,"Take your wife if you go. I did, and she enjoyed it more than she thought she would. However, I enjoyed it less than I thought I would. I enjoyed the battle scenes and as far as I know they seemed pretty realistic (except for the silly hand-to-hand fight near the end). I didn't think the story had much new to offer -- basically the movie was a combination of SHENANDOAH (with Jimmy Stewart) and BRAVEHEART with a little bit of STAR WARS thrown in (when the girl gave the little patriotism speech in the church I leaned over to Cindy and said ""Help me, Obi Wan Kanobi...""). Overall, I would have preferred a little less of Mel Gibson and his personal issues and a little more of the American history.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Revolution #2,"Perhaps director Roland Emmerich is trying to make up for Godzilla, which he also directed. Perhaps he's trying to show us all that the success of Independence Day wasn't just a result of magnificent special effects and a hefty budget. At any rate, Emmerich was taking on quite a challenge, for the last American Revolution movie was that 1985 Al Pacino disaster ""Revolution"". 1776 never seemed so distant as when Al donned that furry hat and passed himself off as an 18th-century trader. Oh, sure, with that accent, no less.This time around, there's a foreigner at the fore. Mel Gibson's from Australia, as some of you might know. Wouldn't know it to hear him speak, of course, with an American accent that's more fluid than anything most of us will ever use in our own lifetimes. Get Mel behind closed doors, though, and I suspect he's all ready to put a shrimp on the ol' barbie. Here, of course, he's as American as he always is in the cinema. Gibson stars as Benjamin Martin, calm farmer, hero of the French and Indian War. Legend has it that Martin went crazy at Fort Wilderness (not the place in Disney World, I soon discovered) and killed a bunch of bad guys. But now he's older and wiser, and he's darn sure he won't be laying to arms against any ol' Redcoats, taxes or no taxes. He's got something like nine kids to feed, all by himself (all you single moms out there, feel free to either commiserate or express your outrage). Well, things tend to change quickly in movies, even if the movie's 160 minutes long (ouch!). Before too long, Ben's pitchfork-deep in the melee, helping the colonials to defeat the British, who are represented (rather haughtily, of course) by Lord Cornwallis. Those of you who remember your history know that eventually(WARNING! WARNING! PLOT ENDING REVEALED! DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU LIKE SURPRISES ABOUT THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR, WHICH OCCURRED OVER 220 YEARS AGO!)Cornwallis surrenders, and the colonists win their freedom. Ah, but half the fun is getting there, right? Luckily, the movie doesn't bog us down with historical details such as battles, dates, etc. Remember Braveheart, that movie with an Australian playing the part of a Scotsman who rallies his people to revolt? This movie's not like that at all, since we have an Australian playing the part of an American who rallies his people to revolt. But while both films are completely different (!), let's look at some wonderful similarities. Disorganized rabble? Check. Evil despot? Check. Gallons and gallons of spilled blood per person? Check. Gratuitous violence? Check and double check!If this were viewed as a historical drama, there would be all sorts of problems with the accuracy of the plot (in fact, the British complained loud and often when the movie premiered, something about it portraying them as evil despots bent on world dominance, or something). Luckily, most of us don't care a whit about such stuff and nonsense, so we look at this movie to show us action. Pounds and pounds of action, preferably in the form of senseless violence. I mean there are decapitations! Who wouldn't want to see that? Many people, of course, but not too many - this film kicked butt at the box office.As a morality tale of sticking to your guns, the film loses its way a little, I think. Benjamin Martin goes against his beliefs for some pretty solid reasons, but after he takes the plunge, all bets are off and we have a straightforward action movie. But as a chance to see Mel strut his hero stuff, it's golden",7.0,Anonymous,History
"An excellent, if somewhat flawed, film and a well-told story.","An excellent film even thought it occasionally takes too much artistic licence. The story concerns a former soldier in the English King's army who has argued that liberty can be brought about by negotiation. He reluctantly joins the American struggle for independence when he witnesses the brutality of the English soldiers first hand.The story is well told and keeps the viewer's attention throughout its more than two and half hours. It is not a flawless film by any means, too many set pieces for one thing, but its portrayal of English brutality is not, as many have suggested, unwarranted. It should serve as a reminder that the British empire ruined entire civilisations and killed millions. No country has yet negotiated or voted its way out of England's grasp, many countries such as Scotland and Wales have failed. Ireland repeatedly tried negotiation and failed, and had to resort to violence. Just like the Americans did.If you liked this film I would recommend ""Braveheart"", ""Michael Collins"" and perhaps ""The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc (1999)""The director is Roland Emmerich a German whose best known films include ""The day after tomorrow"", ""Stargate"", ""Godzilla"" and (very appropriately) ""Independence day"".",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Good, not great- melodramatic but tense and action filled.","Roland Emmerich has been known to bring to the screen such films as Independence Day, Godzilla and The Thirteenth Floor. While these films are good in the sci-fi action sense, he has never done drama or war (I never thought he would do war). But he does here, and he brings a 18th century/revolutionary war film that hasn't been matched (in my eyes) since Barry Lyndon. Mel Gibson is the perfect choice in the role as Benjamin Martin (he has his second soldier role here, the 1st was in Braveheart) as he embodies drama, action and goodness in one big whollop. If you know history, you already know half the plot in this movie before even seeing it.The other half shows a veteran of the war in 1763 who doesn't want to be apart of the Revolution, but is pulled in by revenge and payback (and for the clause). Great entertainment, as another example of war and it's horrors is shown here. One of the better films of 2000. A-",7.0,Anonymous,History
Moral: don't annoy Mel Gibson,The only positive thing that I can say about this movie is that at least it will support Tom Wilkinson's future acting career. Hopefully he will find projects far more worthy of his talent.What most US based critics appear to have overlooked is that the movie is equally insulting to the American Revolutionaries - a generation of Americans will now grow up believing that the Revolution was won only because the British made the fatal mistake of annoying Mel Gibson.I would like to think that Jason Isaacs is sending the whole thing up with his 'Stupid boy!' line (anyone with a passing knowledge of British sitcoms will understand my reference).One day someone will make a decent film about the Revolution. Unfortunately 'The Patriot' is a turkey of some magnitude.,,Anonymous,History
"A too ""political correct"" movie","Well I went to this movie, expecting myself to a eighteen century ""Braveheart"". Big mistake ! The special effects wasn't very ""special"", the atmosphere of epoch is just sketched and the story is just a little bit better than a south-american ""telenovelas"". Of course, the great Mel Gibson do everything he can to give to his character life & consistence, but he can't miss a fight scene one against twenty like in, I know ... ""Mad Max"". The screenplay ? If you expected to something really incendiary stay home ! A mediocre ""political correct"" screenplay show the earlier black people emancipation, but not a single word about native Americans. The British are all killers ( even they try to mask this ... ) and of course incapable to see what mean democracy... at least this is the opinion of producers. I wonder myself - how the French is among the ""good guys"" ? At last I must admit that some players perform remarkable, but...

A very great movie!,"This is one of the best movies on the revolution that has been made. And it pointed out that, in truth the Revolution was won in the South. Washington, first off did not want to fight a war with England, in fact he spent most of his adult life trying to become an English officer. Secondly about Washington was he couldn't win a battle if he had 10 times as many men as the English. And finally, and worst off all, after he won, the poor who had really forced him to go to war and I know as the first in my family fought, and was at Valley Forge starving and without food was situated near the house Washington & his wife stayed at. Eating 3 meals a day, warm as necessary! Oh he was painted, kneeling praying for his men, NICE PUBLICITY STUNT! Then after the war he and his rich friends got to vote, while the men in who had been in the trenches did NOT get to vote. Then Washington tried to steal the land of the western PA people because he had a gift of that land, from an English lord. So he tried to make them pay taxes in silver or gold, knowing full well they had none, and used the barter system to trade for what they needed, CAUSING THE WISKEY REBELLION, as that is what they used to barter!

Patriotic Kitsch,"'The Patriot' is a good film by the norms of Hollywood, belonging to the genre of the historic epic drama. On the positive side it is well done, well acted, with quite a complex action line. On the bad side all is very expected,  many of the 'memorable' lines as well as the characters behavior belong more to low grade history books rather than to an artistic film.  It looks like cinema art did not develop after 'Gone with the Wind'. The film is also very one-sided in its historical approach, pro-American and anti-Brit. Being quite well done, no wonder that American viewers are moved and resonate positively, while British viewers may find it ultrageous  - see some of the IMDB comments. Mel Gibson is on some kind of programatic path with his creation lately, and I like less and less what he is doing. He seems to forget that art is more valuable and durable when political or religious propaganda are played lower key.Over all I watched the film with a mix of cinema enjoyment, and lack of comfort because of the too obvious historical and political message. Too much message, too little emotion. Curiously enough, 'The Patriot'  reminded me some of the films I saw in my younger days, in Communist Romania, where the propaganda machine was enrolling the cinema industry into making films in service of the official ideology. Worth seeing, but controversial for me - 7 out of 10 on my personal scale.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Issacs is the star of the show.,"I remember when this first came out I was angry with Mel Gibson for making another film , after Braveheart , where he fought the nasty English and being a competitive Englishman it got to me which of course , looking back is silly .In this , Gibson plays a farmer , Benjamin Martin , who is driven to lead the Colonial Militia during the American Revolution when a sadistic British officer murders his son.While Mel Gibson is clearly the lead in this film the star of the show , without doubt , it Jason Issacs . He brilliantly portrays the evil Colonel William Tavington who is one of best baddies in a film that I can think of and it's because of the vendettas Ben and William have against each other that make the film so watchable.Sure it predictable but it's also not afraid to be brutal in its portrayal of the British.There is one scene where the Colonel burns a church down full of people inside .I'm sure it's exaggeration for the affect of the movie because I can't believe that would ever have happened but it adds to the rising anger for not only the Militia but for the audience as well .It's two and half hours and while I feel no movie needs to to be that long it never felt like it outstayed it's welcome.Not bad at all .",8.0,Anonymous,History

Army of Perfect People,"Mel Gibson plays Benjamin Martin, or ""the ghost"" - a one man army, family man and a colonel in the Continental Army. He joins the war against the Britts to get vengeance for his sons death, and to look after his oldest son, who joins the fight despite his fathers disapproval.The Patriot is an OK movie, but it lacks the feel of realism, as it is soaked with Hollywood clichés and overflowing heroism, without the grim look of real war. Racism in the south is shrugged upon by small disputes of skin colour in the start of the movie, and ""honor to fight with you"" in the end.Battles are well done, with the red coats and the blue coats marching against each other on open fields in the old ""honourable way"", but the war itself is not the focus of this movie. The focus is put on Martin and his militia, hiding in the swamp and fighting against the Britts on their own terms, ambushing supply wagons and chasing the evil Britt cavalry Captain responsible for Martins son's death.In another words it seems the war for Americas Independence is only in the background, while these two - the hero and the antihero - fight each other. Gibson's character being the perfect family man, who can look beyond skin colour, a man of principle, and of course legend among soldiers. The British cavalry captain is apparently the First Anti-Christ, burning down churches, killing women and children left and right, and of course enjoying it! What I'm trying to say here, is it is not even trying to be historically accurate, and it is not trying to give a statement against war, as all good war films do.But it is worth watching.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,History
Interesting and enjoyable,"Another historic film by Mel Gibson, enjoyable and frightening. One gets the feeling that Mel has something against the British, second film where he goes hard out to kill English troops. Although I am 1/2 English myself, this film made my blood boil toward the English so I can understand what would make a person do the things he did.

One scene when Lisa Brenner stood up and gave her patriot speech just made me cringe. That scene should have been cut out altogether! The only thing that made this film good was good 'ol Mel.Most people would have compared this film to Gibson's Braveheart, but I am more likely to compare this film to The Gladiator. Both films deal with a man who face similar situations. I have to say that I enjoyed Gladiator much more than The Patriot.The Patriot was predictable and too melodramatic.

"Formulaic, predictable, historically questionable, but fun","Okay, let's get the criticism out of the way.  This film was about as historically accurate as Braveheart.  That is to say, there WAS an American Revolution, and it was fought against the British.  The film is formulaic - it's the retired gunfighter being forced out of retirement by dire personal tragedy, forced to commit heinous crimes in the name of justice story. John Wayne did it, why not Mel Gibson?  Also, except for minor plot points, this was an off the shelf script, about as predictable as the orbits of the planets.  Those are the bad points.I enjoyed the movie.  I liked it, and as an example of cinemagraphic excellence, it shines.  Seamless CGI effects make the viewer feel as if they were really on an 18th century battlefield.  Mel is a capable and personable enough actor to carry off this grand a story with relative ease.  Oh, and do they make one HATE the British!  Mel must have a personal grievance against the English.  The Bounty (where you again can see Mel in a ponytail) was not complimentary to Her Majesty's navy, Braveheart showed us the evil Longshanks, and now The Patriot's Colonel Tavington (Jason Isaacs) makes William Carey seem like Mother Teresa!  All in all, an enjoyable film, as long as one doesn't intend to accept it as historical fact.",,Anonymous,History
A movie that tried too hard - even Mel couldn't save it.,"If the director could have just picked a theme and stuck with it, this could have been a great movie, but somewhere between the responsible father, invincible soldier, paragon of masculinity, clever frontiersman, and American patriot that Benjamin Martin was supposed to portray this movie lost me.  What was he fighting for?  What was America fighting for?  Are the answers to these two questions the same?  If someone had just tried to make that last answer yes, this could have been a great movie...unfortunately, the answer is ""maybe"" and what we got was a little bit cluttered - a good movie?

Best I've seen on the American Revolution.,"There's some ""Hollywoodized"" history here, but ""The Patriot"" is arguably the most accurate movie ever made on the American Revolution.  Many Americans, because of their conditioning,  tend to have a ""Manifest Destiny"" attitude towards their revolution. They have the vague belief that the colonists were inevitably going to win. But the war was an extremely difficult one and easily could have been lost, were it not for some good fortune and the alliance with France.Gibson's movie zeroes in perfectly on the extreme difficulties of the revolution, and graphically depicts the mind sets of the Patriots, the Loyalists and the ""middle group"" that was constantly being pressured by both their rebellious neighbors and by occupying British and Loyalist forces. The South was one of the bitterest areas of the Revolution, partly because the British were growing desperate to crush the rebels, and all of this comes through in the movie.My only slight misgiving is the length of the movie and perhaps too much depiction of family sentimentalities.  The concluding scene, which shows an American triumph and the survival of the hero, is quite appropriate, and invokes memories of ""Braveheart,"" another Gibson triumph.Well worth watching, for both history buffs, like myself, and other types of movie goers.",8.0,Anonymous,History

If only.......,"In my own theories about the modern world of film-making, there are lots of obsessions with making films that contain depressing details of savagery and slaying and they can be very tricky that it isn't everyones' taste and it can be told better in documentary programmes. In the classic case of the film titled The Patriot, I can imagine it being in around the late 1770s prior to the fall of British control on the USA. There are lots of good features about the film and the times are well reconstructed here and they are very much like Yorktown and Williamsburg with the architects and this is what I particularly like about this film and it reminds me of my visit to these places. I think most of the characters on the silver screen are fictitious and the casting of Mel Gibson is quite good while Jason Isaacs is excellent as a brutal army commander having already starred in a mini series called Civvies. As already stated, there are weaknesses about the film and its plot along with some depressing battlefield scenes and some overacting but in fairness, it actually happened around that time.",7.0,Anonymous,History

I am english and i can accept(as all english people have) that the patriots gave us limeys a butt kicking and with a lot of help from other european nations(notably france)or not,you still beat us and thats what matters.But what does bother me and what does matter is how hollywood constantly alters history to sell movies,you won the war,why lie about it???,you dont need to lie about this,make a film about this subject and keep to the facts and there will always be one ending to this film,an american victory.Is this not good enough? wont this please an american audience?

Interesting and entertaining for 3 hours!,"The really gives audiences what they would want to see for their money. It is a three hour film filled with glorious scenery, action, special effects, Mel Gibson pulling some wonderful faces and a whole cast of likeable rogues.  It had echoes of the director's previous film, Independence Day and the writer's previous film, Saving Private Ryan.  If you could imagine these two films melted down together and then taken to the lowest common denominator you would have The Patriot. The film is too exaggerated to take the history as more than a backdrop to the human drama.  It mixes humour with tragedy, never taking the audience down into the darkness too deeply.  Mel Gibson's character has some depth and complexity, but I felt that this was never really explored, which was a pity. It did however, keep me interested for 3 hours, which is quite an accomplishment.  I put this down to the very professional technical merits of the film and a series of watchable stars inhabiting interesting characters. Just out of interest, it was one of the few films that actually uses the Dolby Surround Sound to service the plot.",8.0,Anonymous,History
The Patriot - so close,"Going in, I didn't expect much of the Patriot.  This is usually how I approach films.  I think I was better off having done that in this particular instance.  Don't get me wrong.  The Patriot is really not bad at all.  But it lacks any real oomph.  There are a couple of cheap shots, IMHO, that just want to get an audience reaction.  On top of that, there are some characters who seem either too forced into the film or too cliched.  Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger are awfully good, as is Chris Cooper, but the above elements, combined with some odd plot elements and a weak score from John Williams make me hesitate to recommend the film to everyone.  If you are a war buff or this movie comes to your local second-run theater, check it out. Otherwise, don't be in a hurry, unless you want to see some great cinematography for about 3 hours.",6.0,Anonymous,History
This is how it happened,"Look, I don't mind historically inaccurate films--Braveheart was terrific fun, this, however, is bobbins!!! The Evil Empire lost the war because RoboGibson destroyed the Brits single handed. Who else could save the US but the mighty Gibson...Half patriotic, half killing machine ---no one will stand in his way. If there was a remake of Independence Day don't bother with fighter jets, tanks and computer virus' just send in The Gibsonator. I'm looking forward to a sequel when The Mighty Gibson goes to all the former British colonies and saves them (whether they wanted it or not) from The Evil Empire...Because this film is right on the nose, we regally burn down buildings with people inside just for the sake of it, we're Brits it's what we do.*sigh...*That's pretty much the film...",1.0,Anonymous,History

Braveheart LITE,"This film is somewhat thrilling, and at the same time empty.  It has no historical significance, except for maybe our ability to turn our history into pop corn entertainment.

Majestic motion picture about the American Revolutionary War,"""The Patriot"" is without a doubt the best movie about the American Revolutionary War that was ever made. The movie is somehow the Revolutionary War's version of ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" but only in reverse. Where in ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" is a story about a young German student Paul Baumer who gets caught up with the pro-war enthusiasm of August 1914 and eagerly joins the Kaiser's army only to lose his love for war after seeing up front the horrors and bloodshed that war spawned. Where as in ""The Patriot"" the story is just the opposite.In the movie we have a man Benjamin Martin, Mel Gibson,who fought with honor and bravery in the French and Indian War of 1754-60. Martin was so repelled by the war that he never wanted to have anything to do with war again. It wasn't until his home was burned down and his young son Thomas, Gregory Smith, was murdered by the British and his older son Gabriel, Heath Ledger, taken away by them to be hanged that Benjamin Martin changed his mind. Turning into a tiger and fighting like hell against the Red Coats with a fury that was impressive enough to inspire those of his fellow Colonialists to fight along with him.""The Patriot"" is both grand in scope and deep and rich in the history that it presents. It's everything that a movie about an historic event like the American Revolutionary War should be. Well written and acted with beautiful and breath-taking photography and with an eye on the details of the era 1775-1781 that makes you feel as if you were there.You can see just what a good actor Mel Gibson is in his first battle scene when he attacks a British unit with his two young sons who have his older son Gabriel being taken away to be executed. In a matter of minutes he changes from a peaceful and law biding person into a savage and blood-thirsty killer that's so convincing that it almost makes you for just that moment feel sorry for the British soldiers. Who are about to kill his oldest son and murdered by shooting in the back his younger son Thomas just moments before.There's a number of equally effective scenes in the movie ending in one of the most action packed and realistic battle sequences ever filmed in any war movie in motion picture history.With the movie ending at Yorktown Va. with the British Army of Gen. Cornwallis trapped between the Continental Army on land and the French Fleet blocking their escape to the sea on October 19, 1781 that ended the Revolutionary War in the American Colonialists favor.""The Patriot"" is always being compared to Mel Gibson's previous historical movie classic ""Braveheart"" and alway seems to come out second best. I feel that ""The Patriot"" is every bit as good as ""Braveheart"" if not even a better movie. It's ""The Patriot's"" misfortune to have been made some five years after ""Braveheart"" so it comes across like it's not an entirely different movie then ""Braveheart"" but it's sequel",10.0,Anonymous,History
Great Depiction of an Ugly Time,"This film could very easily be misunderstood. It does depict, irrefutably, a very dark time in American History and I believe it achieves its purpose, quite satisfactorily. Whenever a Hollywood production is released, there must be drama, a protagonist as well as an antagonist, a hero and a villain. It must be a spectacular rendition of the story it tells and to remove the spectacle is to gamble with the Box Office returns. Benjamin Martin (M. Gibson) may be depicted as a ""larger than life"" figure, but isn't that the whole point of making a film, to elicit some emotion? As far as exaggeration is concerned, according to a previous review of the ""rescue"" scene, the reviewer seems to be the only one exaggerating. It is not a ""company"" of men, not even a platoon, more like a couple of squads, so when a review is being submitted, at least have the foresight and respect to get the facts straight. This is a great film and very inspirational besides.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Identity crisis,"The Patriot has been described, rather prematurely, as an american Braveheart.  While The Patriot is nothing like Braveheart, it is still far from the greatness of that movie.  Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad movie, just flawed in two very annoying story elements.  The first is death. I won't say who dies, but there are a lot of key characters killed off.  So many, in fact, that I stopped caring after a while.  The other problem is the biggie.  The filmmakers, apparantly, couldn't figure out what type of movie they wanted to make.  There are revenge movies, like Gladiator.  There are movies about wars, like Saving Private Ryan.  The Patriot seems to want to be both of these movies at the same time.  The lead character vows revenge on a british soldier.  This is a movie on its own.  However, they try to place american history in very inconvenient places.  I couldn't figure out if the movie was made to show Mel Gibson's character, or to give an insight into the American Revolution.The Patriot isn't that bad though, and it has its strong points.  Mel Gibson gives another stunning performance as our hero.  He seems to posses the same drive that allowed him to play William Wallace.  Heath Ledger shows that he is ready for the spotlight with his role as the rebellious son.  Jason Isaacs is one of the best villains in a year with all kinds of great villains, such as Joaquin Phoenix in Gladiator, and the storm in The Perfect Storm.  The Patriot is a three star movie, which is too bad.  It had some great potential.",7.0,Anonymous,History
One of the most riveting war epics,"First off, I am a big Mel Gibson fan, have been ever since Braveheart. I haven't seen a movie yet where he doesn't give every performance his all. The Patriot is no different. Not only is the movie historically accurate, it nails the source material. Gibson's character is based on the famous Swamp Fox, and plays the part perfectly. What makes his character unique is that he is human, and is flawed. The action sequences are well timed, and are not there just to keep the bored viewers entertained. I have seen this movie five times, four of which came from school. Every year in American government, we watched this film as a reminder of what history was like, and the people who fought for our freedom in the events leading up to the signing of the Declaration of Independence. All in all, a very good war epic, and one of Mel Gibson's best performance.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Entertaining War Movie,"The Patriot is set during the war of Independence and is about a man seeking revenge for his son, who was killed by a sadistic British soldier.Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson) is a peaceful farmer raising seven kids alone, as his wife has died. His eldest son, Gabriel (Heath Ledger) immediately signs up to go to war, however, he is later captured by Colonal William Tavington (Jason Isaacs), a British soldier notorious for his brutal tactics and sentenced to hang. When Benjamin's second eldest son, Thomas (Gregory Smith) goes to help his brother, he is shot down and killed by Tavington in cold blood.Taking his younger children to live with their aunt (Joely Richardson), Benjamin sets out to avenge his sons death.The Patriot is a very entertaining movie and unlike most war movies, doesn't last for about four hours. It runs just over two hours. Mel Gibson as always, is very watchable as he is blessed with a lot of screen presence and electricity on screen. Jason Isaacs captures Tavington's cold heart perfectly and is enjoyable to watch. However, the scene stealer is the young actress who plays Benjamin's youngest daughter Susan, Skye McCole Bartusiak. Just eight years old at the time of filming, she has delivered a performance that could put to shame some of the greats. The depth and emotion she brings to her character is unbelievable and their is one scene involving her that will have you crying your eyes out.If you're an American, you will particularly enjoy it as it is very patriotic (as the title may suggest), but even so, it is a very enjoyable movie.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Worth The Watch,"I like this film. It is directed by Roland Emmerich. Mel Gibson & fellow Australian Heath Ledger are realistic as father and son. This is the film which turnedill-fated Ledger into a heart-throb. Even a very young Logan Lerman plays one of Gibson's sons. Jason Isaacs is perfectly cast as the primary antagonist. He has made a career of playing ""the bad guy"". Tom Wikinson, Adam Baldwin and Chris Cooper round out the powerful cast. There is truly outstanding cinematography by Caleb Deschsnel which is accompanied by the excellent soundtrack by John Williams. However, it tends to be more dramatic & romantic, as opposed to realistic. Personally, I prefer the outstanding film ""The Last of the Mohicans"" (1992) led by Daniel Day-Lewis, Madeleine Stowe Russell Means, Eric Schweig, & Jodhi May. It is superbly directed by Michael Mann. Regardless, ""The Patriot"" is still a great watch & well worth the time. A solid 8 in my book.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Nigh-jingoistic and wildly inaccurate... but a ripping yarn, nonetheless","Don't see this looking for accuracy -- there are a thousand details either wrong or fancifully construed (why would redcoats waste valuable lead to kill rebel wounded, when they were so well known for their bayonets? why do we only see characters reloading or priming when it suits a plot-point? how do characters manage to carry their muzzle-loaders barrel down and still fire the weapon?). It's rife with stereotypes such as the ruthless Tavington (obviously modeled loosely on the Tory dragoon commander Tarleton, for whom was coined the term ""Tarleton's Quarter"").Some of the special effects are a bit hokey and gratuitous. The cannonballs-taking-off-limbs effect got old... oh, I dunno, THE FIRST TIME?!... and why did they have to digitally matte some shots of troops manouvering in the field?).And the plot -- hoo, boy, hard to recall a more manipulative effort in recent memory. Burning the whole town to death in the church was a bit over the top. And Gibson pulls out every item in his bag of tricks to jerk the tears.But you know what? Despite all that, it's still a well-made hollywood flick. Gibson pulls out all his tricks -- but he's _got_ the tricks to pull (easy to forget with some of the tripe he's turned out that he's actually a damn good actor).

Liberty to oppress anyone from the Chinese to the Irish.  Liberty to wipe out the heathen Indians who squat on white mans land.  Liberty to drop two atom bombs when one was probably enough. Liberty to not be Communist or suspected to be Communist (McCarthy should be an honourary Englishman).  Liberty to plan a contained nuclear war in far away Europe.  Liberty to fight for freedom in the world anywhere, anytime until a soldier sprains his ankle or something then have the Liberty get the hell out.

Bravery ando fight,"From the movie Patriota 2000, it can be understood that if a man isolates himself from the war, she comes to him, that is when a father of a family seeks to fight for the life of his son, it is noted that many times he fights for freedom, for Having dignity as a human being, as a family, that brings many consequences or brought many obstacles that must be resolved during the process.In the scenes it is possible to see that wars or defending survival implies a liberation and a general development as an individual, community and country. A scene that stood out a lot is when the leader of the film is classified as a traitor to the British army and also a fighter who seeks the freedom of his community, in the same way when he leads men who are tired of the same reality.Something that is very controversial is the number of deaths such as the massacre that was obtained in those wars, for the independence of the United States, a level of courage is expressed at the time of loading weapons, shooting and facing the weapons of the enemy, it should be clarified that each of those situations or scenes that were narrated in the film do not show the concrete reality of what happened.",7.0,Anonymous,History

I recommend this movie.,"The director Roland Emmerich did his best. All at the highest level: casting, screen writing, filming, fight scenes and more. Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson) well done! Different combined genres ""Drama + Action +War + History"" made the movie good for look. Mel Gibson played the best father's role that loves his family very much and will make everything for protecting them. Col. William Tavington (Jason Isaacs) is good too. Keeps himself confidently! He was a good villain. Without such good villains some movies seems incomplete. The patience of Benjamin is fantastic. Imagine yourself: Your son is killed but you taking no action at that moment. Benjamin waits for the good moment. The best scene that draws attention to itself is when: The dozen Redcoats approach, leading Gabriel on the rope. Benjamin waits in the thick undergrowth. On the hillside, Nathan and Samuel grip their muskets and exchange a frightened, troubled look. Benjamin picks his moment and FIRES, killing the Redcoat Lieutenant with a shot to his chest. Benjamin runs to the wounded Redcoat, grabs his hair, yanks back his head and SLITS HIS THROAT. Then, without pausing, wrenches the tomahawk from the Redcoat's body, and races back toward his sons.

A Story That Should Be Told.,"Tha American War of Independence is a story worthy of telling. A people wrest a nation from the world's greatest military power.

Good people do bad things and vice-versa. I think the Nazis had a lock on herding women and children into churches and setting them on fire. Doesn't seem British to me. Happy slaves saying all men are all of a sudden created equal ignores that a hundred years after the Patriot, battlefields would be in vogue again without any evil foreigners. And a hundred years after that there would be finally the civil rights movement. Can't someone tell this story with a little factual content? It would be a great story.

"Mel, swords, bloodshed and those damn English!","Films about war are always full of inacuracies.  They have to be.  When you have a hero with the face of Mel Gibson or perhaps Sylvester Stallone ( when he was big )or whomever, you are vying for box office dollars in a crowded market.  So you are appealing to the masses, and in this case, the masses are Americans and the timing is the Independence Day weekend.  Does it really matter how accurate this film is?  Does it really matter if it shows the Americans as nothing but brave patriots that are only interested in becoming independent?  Does it really matter if most of the English in this film are nothing more than blood-thirsty mongers that want to burn, and plague everything in their path?Of course not.  And I could really care less either.  This is the summer season and in the summer, in the big picture, all I ask to be is entertained.  I am not here for a history lesson nor do I care if this is nothing more than a xenophobic account of what may or may not have really happened to my neighbours to the south.  I want to sit in the theater and suck back a Coke, devour some M&M's and be entertained.  And so far, with average efforts like Shaft, MI2, Shanghai Noon and abyssmal ones like Battlefield Earth, the market and the fans, people like me, are ready to enjoy some ass kicking, and some entertaining ass kicking.  Mel Gibson and Roland Emmerich provide that here.The Patriot is a simple enough story about a great war hero from the years past that has hung up his musket and sword and wants to raise a family.  He has done some heinous things in the past that he is obviously not proud of and he has a terrible and imminent fear that his sins are going to come back to haunt him.  The United States has decided to go to war with England for it's freedom and it's independence.  But William.... I mean Benjamin wants no part of it.  His oldest son, Gabriel, (in an amazing performance by Heath Ledger from 10 Things I Hate About You) is eager to join the battle.  Soon after, he returns home with battle wounds and Benjamin is tending to both countries wounded on the porch of his house.  It is then that Col. William Tavington comes along, and for reasons unknown, except that he is a sadist, decides to take Gabriel hostage and then hang him, kill all of the American wounded, burn down Ben's house and then he kills one of his younger sons. Quite a guy this Tavington is.  This, of course, gets Benjamin into the war. And it is this next scene that is one of the best battle scenes I have ever seen.  Benjamin and two of his young sons attack and kill the men that are taking Gabriel hostage.  The battle is great because the men that are being hunted and killed are not cartoon characters that pop out of nowhere only to die.  They are young, scared, boys, following orders and are just on the wrong side of the war.  You see the fear, the anguish and the sheer horror on their face as they are about to die patriotically.The rest of the film has a few minor sub-plots of love and other boring stuff that only serves as a purpose so that when someone's wife or girlfriend dies, it gives the men a chance to seek vengence.  But the real highlight of the film is the battles.  They are bloody and brutal and I enjoyed them immensely.  When a cannonball is launched and it takes off legs and heads, it gives you the proper perspective of war.  It is just enough to remind us that as much as we are enjoying this ""film"", these events really did take place and just like Saving Private Ryan, they were brutal and final.  This is not like Commando, when Arnold mows down 95 men with an M-16 and they drop like flies.  This is violent, nasty and bloody.The Patriot may be liked by Americans because it is about their fight for independence.  It may be liked by them because it shows how they fought for what they have.  It be liked by them because it shows how proud they are of what they had and what it took to get it.I like it because it is fun, entertaining and it is a great summer flick. That's all.  Nothing more and nothing less.  I'm very glad this film was made because here we are, now heading into July 1st, Canada Day, and so far this summer, we have had one amazing film (Gladiator), one truly hilarious film (Road Trip), two moderately funny films (Me Myself and Irene, Big Mommas House) and a slew of okay films (take your pick).  The Patriot won't top Gladiator as the best of the bunch so far, but at least it can be mentioned in the same breath.8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,History

"Technically-impressive war film, but it's all been seen before.","The Patriot is a Revolutionary War action film from the team of director Roland Emmerich and producer Dean Devlin, known for lame sci-fi schlock like Godzilla and Independence Day. With Patriot, this pair has once again fallen short of their aspirations. Although it has substantial technical quality, this cannot mask that that movie is a stale rehash of scenes and ideas we have seen too many times.Mel Gibson stars as Benjamin Martin, a Colonial farmer with a dark past he earned for his actions during the French and Indian War.  He also has over a half dozen children, and because of this, when the battle for independence between the American Colonies and the British Empire spills into his backyard, he chooses not to fight. However, his oldest son Gabriel, played by relative newcomer Heath Ledger, is eager to join the rebel army, and thus drags his father into the conflict.Gibson and Ledger are both good in their headlining roles, and bring much-needed credibility to the cast. The other stand-out here is as Martin's second oldest son, proof that good child actors do, in fact, still exist. But the rest of the actors can not stand up to both the intimidating presence of Gibson, nor  the limpness of the unoriginal and overlong script. Chris Cooper looks simply bored as a Colonel and old friend of Martin's, and Tom Wilkinson plays General Cornwallis as a prissy fop. That's pretty much how all the English in Patriot are depicted: as either simpering fools like Cornwallis or his Lieutenants, or blood-thirsty savages like the head villain, the devilish and psychotic Colonel Tavington.Tavington enters the picture in the first half-hour, committing an act that thrusts Ben Martin into the struggle between America and England. Up until this point, The Patriot has been fairly subtle and ponderous, but all the while exciting. When Tavington arrives on the scene, the film deteriorates into a cheap and lazy action movie with all the predictable turns, albeit some great cinematography.That great cinematography, along with the performances of Gibson and Ledger, are all that help the movie hover above its boring, pedestrian script. We've seen these scenes time and time again, and they seem to get worse every time. Gibson recruits a team of rag-tag guerrilla soldiers to help him in his fight. There's a Frenchman played by Tchéky Karyo, and that description is the soul and essence of the character. He's French. He has funny French clothes, and a funny French accent. There's also a preacher who shocks his town in a supposedly comedic scene by taking up arms with his fellow Americans. Along with these two is an assortment of two-fisted scoundrels and pirates. They're each given a couple of clunky one-liners to help solidify them in our minds before they're killed by the evil British. It doesn't work.The worst of these characters is a slave who fights with the Colonials in order to win his freedom, following a new statement decreed by General Washington. The other soldiers despise him, but once he saves their lives, they become honored to have him on their side. This is just one example of the fake, mock sentimentality pressed onto the audience throughout the movie. On the subject of slavery and these politically correct emotions, the Africans we see working in the fields of Martin's home are discovered to not be slaves at all, but are instead free black men who work the land for Gibson, and are paid. How Emmerich or screenwriter Robert Rodat did not recognize the stupidity of making such statements about their character, in the time period of the film, is incredible.The rest of the cast fares even worse. Jason Isaacs gives an admirable attempt as the wicked Tavington, but like almost everyone else in Patriot, he cannot rise above the cartoonish nature of his character. He kills children. He says evil, despicable things. He burns an entire quaint little town to ashes by locking them inside their church and having his men set the structure ablaze. Maybe all this would have some weight if the viewer didn't realize from the first minute the two laid eyes on each other that The Patriot would conclude with the trusty fist fight between the heroic Gibson and the serpentine Isaacs, complete with slow-motion dramatics and characters who choose to give speeches while they have more than enough time to dispatch their foe.Also weak is Joely Richardson as Charlotte, the sister of Gibson's deceased wife. It's not really her fault; her role as Martin's love interest is shallow and strangely cryptic, considering the character she's playing. An even worse female role is Anne Howard, played by Lisa Brenner, the requisite cute love interest for Ledger. She's annoying and grating, and although her ultimate fate of pitiful, its hard to imagine how the movie would have been bearable if she had a larger role.The battle scenes are nice, but after the first time we see one, nothing changes. We are then treated to the same-styled carnage several times, and each one gets even more haphazard and unexciting. The final conflict of the film makes an attempt at a Braveheart-like spectacle, but cannot rouse much substance to go along with its epic camera sweeps. To its credit, the rest of the movie makes no effort to even try and rip-off much of anything from the similarly-themed Gibson classic.In the end, The Patriot is a well-made film, but we've seen everything it has to offer numerous times, and many of those experiences have been far superior.Patriot receives a 7 out of 10.",,Anonymous,History
American war of independence,"A very enjoyable film but inaccurate in places. Portrays the English as rather fascist especially with regard to burning people in a church, something the Nazis did in France! I think with a little more research on behalf of the film makers this could have been an accurate historical drama. The portrayal of slaves fighting alongside continentals does make one think that they were forced into doing this as historically the English offered freedom to any slave of a rebel colonist. Also George Washington at this time still owned 250 or more slaves as did most of the signatories of the declaration of independence. The main character played by Mel Gibson was also a slave owner. On the causes of the war, taxation, the average American paid one shilling in taxes to the crown of england, where the average Englishman paid 25 shillings a year.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Although historically inaccurate, performances of such talented actors truly ignite the screen and brought this movie to life. It clearly displays our heroes hardships, sufferings, sacrifices, the joys, tears and countless lives they have to give up to mold and to present the gift of freedom to this country. Although this movie may not be suitable to everyone (due to violence) but beneath the external bloodshed and brutality, lies its true meaning: The family bonding, which may be one of the strongest point of this film.I would highly recommend this movie to everyone.

Seriously...did everyone *really* miss the point!,"I heard it called everything from ""mindless dribble"" to a ""masterpiece of cinematography"". My favourites are that it's ""anti-English"", which is laughable as it honours one of England's most cherished legends.990 reviews (I'm sure there were more but this seems to be the limit)and only 5 have even come close to evaluating what this movie was *really* about.For the 985 other reviews (who apparently failed Literature 101), I'll let you in on the writer's little secret. What ""The Patriot"" is, is a clever, metaphoric, adaptation of ""Robin Hood""...plan and simple.It was so obvious to me that I can't understand how, in five years, no one has pointed it out before (exception: Kledge - 22 July 2000).Let me Cliff Note the sub-plot for you (Sorry, I won't be as clever as Sid in ""Sleep With Me"")...Benjamin Martin (Mel) is Robin of Locksley, Charlotte Selton is Maid Marian (as was -to a lesser extent- Anne Howard/Martin), Gabriel is Will ScarlettCome on...John Billings is so obviously Little John (complete with the same family he had in ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"") ...the list goes on and on, they even have a Friar Tuck!I mean seriously...the Spanish Church is obviously Sherwood Forest... they even mount ""steal from the rich"" raids. And, the rescue of Robin's men (err...I mean Martin's men)...straight from the Robin Hood legend.And, for you 400 whiney royalist, who complained about how ""unfair"" the movie was to the ""historic accuracy"" of the British army....whaaa, whaaa, whaaa! Col. William Tavington was not portraying a historic Dragoon Captain, he was portraying Sir Guy of Gisborne. He was an evil SnOB because *Gisborne* is an evil and ruthless character. If you're comparing historic accuracies, use Robin Hood lore, not Revolutionary War history! ...and then, don't bother. Metaphors are the spice not the main course.That they were able to weave this into a totally different period piece as nothing short of remarkable.Bottom line, it's an entertaining, *multi-level*, movie.

This war movie will make America Rebuild for good!,"This was a good war movie. It was about a family where one of the boys named Gabriel(Heath Ledger from Knight's Tale) is senteced to be excecuted by the British. This movie is based on the American Revolution in 1776. It explains what occured during that time on the Carolina part of America. This is a good movie for adults to watch if they are into history. The events of this movie is set 225 years before Sept, 11. People in America can watch the movie to know what tragedies occured back then during the American Revolution. The only thing is that the story has been changed around for a more fictiony type film. In real-life the Americans killed the British by burning the church down instead of the British killing the Americans. This movie offers action as well as drama. This movie is good to watch. This movie offers sadness as well as hapiness to this film. This movie should have been one of the most banned movies in the post-Sept,11 era because this movie was sad while the terrorism films such as Die Hard, and The Siege was at least happy and more on the enjoying side.

It is understandable that the Brits have disdain for this movie as it certainly takes liberties with the truth and shows them in a bad light. All directors have creative license to maximize the entertainment value even at the expense of rewriting history if it is necessary. This is a work of fiction loosely based on events and people at that time. It is not a documentary proclaiming that all you are about to see is factual. Gibson is great in the role of Benjamin Martin, but it is his adversary that makes the movie special. Jason Isaacs was masterful in his portrayal of the sadistic Col William Tavington. A supporting cast that includes the impeccable Tom Wilkinson, Joley Richardson and Heath Ledger only adds to the enjoyment of a memorable movie. That Is Entertainment!",8.0,Anonymous,History
a decent shot at an epic movie,"The Patriot is by no means one of the greatest movies ever made.  Anyone who says so needs to take a look at the AFI list and see some of them.  But it is an enjoyable film, and it is a good shot at an epic story.The film does a fairly good job of balancing the conflict between telling a story about a man and his family and telling the larger story of the revolutionary war.  I do not make any claims towards the historical accuracy of the film--as far as I am concerned that is a non-issue--but I do think that as a film working within the confines of a historical-epic-drama genre, it does a good job of handling the Hollywood structure, as formulaic as that may sometimes seem.I would definitely hesitate to say that this film is Braveheart in the Revolution. Except for falling into the same genre, fighting the same opposing nation, and starring the same lead actor, as movies they are quite different.  Braveheart focuses on the passion of William Wallace and his ability to lead a nation to freedom against all odds.  It's like Moses in the bible--he leads the people to freedom but can't live in the rewards of it.  The Patriot is much more about the personal story of one man and his family in the larger context of America at war for freedom.  Benjamin Martin is haunted by the ghosts of his violent past, and must come to terms with them if he is to live in the present.  It is about the struggle and determination of Americans to gain freedom, but it is also about coming of age and maturity, the changing relationships of father and son, etc.One of the things that I liked about this movie, was that even though the antagonist Col. Tavington was genuinely evil, his superior, Gen. Cornwallis, was not depicted as one of the evil redcoats, but rather as a somewhat anachronistic gentleman unable to adapt to the changing rules of war.On the whole, a decent summer movie.  Not spectacular.  But fun to watch.",,Anonymous,History

Outstanding movie that deserved a far better review at its release..,"This was one of the very best movies ever made about the American Revolution. This movie was panned solely by the elitist critics because it portrayed (shudder) ""children using guns."" Sorry to the people who did not like this sad but true fact of life, but that is the way things happened for real back then. The British really did commit countless atrocities against American women and children during that War. There were the infamous prison ships that captured Americans were sent to die on from slow starvation. Many of the original signers of the Declaration of Independence themselves suffered greatly at the hands of the British. That is a movie Mel Gibson should make someday. Sorry to the English but your ancestors were not prim and proper in the way they brutalized America back in those days. All Americans and immigrants to the USA owe it to themselves to read the true history of what really happened to the original signers of the Declaration of Independence. One General who signed the Declaration for real whose own house had been commandeered by the English soldiers asked why it was not being fired upon by their own cannons? The men under his command did not want to target his home. He then gave the order himself to fire upon his own home which was then totally destroyed. In real life he died a penniless pauper on the streets after winning the war. This movie should be required watching for all American School children. Sorry if any English people are offended but no offense to you but the outrage I read in print and I heard in audio clips from your side of the pond over the brutality portrayed in this movie was far less than what was actually done to many of the signers of the Declaration of Independence.

Beautifully made war epic,"""The Patriot"" is a sweeping war epic that takes place during the Revolutionary War in 1776. Beautifully directed by Roland Emmerich (""Independence Day"") and well written by Robert Rodat (""Saving Private Ryan""), ""The Patriot"" stars Mel Gibson in one of his best film roles as Benjamin Martin, a widowed farmer who's taking care of his seven children. Martin had fought in an earlier war, and doesn't want anything to do with the Revolutionary War. That is until a terrible incident happens to his family, and he is forced to fight against the British. Gibson gives a powerful performance here, and he should get an Oscar nomination. Also giving a good performance in ""The Patriot"" is Australian newcomer Heath Ledger (who starred in last year's ""10 Things I Hate About You"") as Gibson's oldest son Gabriel, who joins his father in action. The other roles in the film are good, but the performances by Gibson and Ledger are the ones people will be talking about. The film also works on a technical level. The action scenes are brutal as you would expect from a war film, but very well done. The beautiful look of the film is also a plus. And there are some comic moments thrown in for good measure. I only had one minor complaint with ""The Patriot"" and that it's overlong. The movie runs 2 hours and 40 minutes, and it drags a little here and there. If it had been 20 or 30 minutes shorter, it would have been better. But other than that, ""The Patriot"" is for the most part a terrific war film, and far, far, far, far, far, far, far, far, far, far better than Al Pacino's 1985 disaster ""Revolution"" which was also about the Revolutionary War.***1/2 (out of four)",9.0,Anonymous,History

Dramatic,"I don't like violence, and this movie had lots of it and some gruesome scenes, but the story was more than just about a war, it was about a family, individual lives of very human people who fought for their country.

There were cruel people on both sides of the war, I'm sure (Tavington was the most cruel in the movie, though).Overall, I thought the movie was very dramatic and riveting, with good acting and suspenseful moments and emotional moments (yes, I was crying). It would have been even more emotional (and too gruesome) seeing it on a big screen.  I wouldn't recommend it to young children.The little girls on the movie were cute.  The young girl who played Susan was a good actress, and the scene where she finally cried ""Papa!"" and ran to him was very emotional.It's a powerful movie, showing war in all it's awful reality and the families that were separated by it.",8.0,Anonymous,History
It a movie folks and a good one,"First it's a movie and not a documentary, it captures the emotional sentiments at the time and the main character is made of really 3 people roles into one storyline and it does not promise history. It does however capture the tactics that won the war for the Americans as well as capturing some of the brutality that happens in war and the British could be rather brutal as the tavington was . Tavington was at the battle of cowpens and drove his army very hard and the men were tired from an all night march in order to capture the Americans before they could cross the river. However on the American side they had planned for this and set the trap. Before this was the battle of kings mountain and that commander had promised to come and fire every house if the Scottish Irish did not join the Brit's.. they took their accurate hunting rifles and decimated the British on top of kings mountain and they were well out numbered and beat them terribly.Cornwallis was trying to meet up with tavington and he should have waited and rested his army. But he went in and got his army clobbered and survived.This film combines these essentials in a compelling story again not actual history, but certainly capturing the character of the times. It would take many hours of documentary over a period of days to tell the actual and interesting history. But let's face it Even it's the directors cut this film has limited time and has to keep peoples attention. The film motivated me to read more about the time and watch some other documentaries.

Excellent movie,"THE PATRIOT is an excellent movie with attention to historical detail in terms of dress, interiors, and modes of speaking. In terms of actual history, however, Hollywood has revised history to suit their script. For instance, the great battle at the end of the movie was supposed to be based on the Battle of Cowpens, but General Cornwallis was not at Cowpens. Banastre Tarleton was in charge of the British troops at Cowpens. Secondly, there was no ruined plantation mansion at Cowpens because it was literally an open range ""cow pens,"" hence the name ""Cowpens."" Mel Gibson's character was supposed to be based on Francis Marion (the Swamp Fox), but again various liberties have been taken. The character of Tarington is based on Banastre Tarleton (a.k. The Butcher), but again another fictional character. Tarleton's Legion actually wore green uniforms with red trim. The King's Own Dragoons wore red uniforms with white trim. The attention to historical detail was great, but again various liberties were taken for the sake of Hollywood revisionism.

The Last Refuge of a Scoundrel,"In 1776, South Carolina widower Mel Gibson (as Benjamin Martin) is reluctant to join in the War of Independence from England, preferring to settle differences through talks with King George.

Just as I expected,"I went into ""The Patriot"" expecting a great movie portraying the Revolutionary War as it was and not overexaggerating on a fictional storyline which would totally ruin it.

Very Well Done Historical Fiction,"WARNING: This review may reveal portions of the plot.When a film is done well, the length doesn't matter -- it can be long or short, and people will enjoy it. When a film is done VERY WELL, then the amount of time needed to tell the story should be used -- whatever that length of time. In the case of ""The Patriot,"" it takes almost 3 hours.""The Patriot"" succeeds best by taking a story that we all think we know -- the War for Independence -- and making it personal. It succeeds in showing what the cost of war is, even when the ends seem just. It shows how a man can be pushed in war to a point no one in his family or friends -- including himself -- could believe he could reach.But don't take this movie as historical fact. While wrapped around history, there was no Benjamin Martin. Martin is the war's everyman, the militia leader called into action to save a family that he desperately tried to save by staying OUT of the war and couldn't. He knew how bloodthirsty he could become, and it scared him. What the film will show is the historic events that created the war, the division of the country on both sides of the issue, and how close we came to losing this war as it dragged on for almost 6 years. (Be honest -- did you know that the War for Independence was more than 5 years long? Or that it only STARTED in 1776, not that it ended then?) It takes our history books and puts a face to them, although that face is the face of a fictional character. Somehow, that's okay, for it takes the statistics from history and makes them real for us today.When ""Saving Private Ryan"" came out many veterans described it as the most accurate portrayal of WWII ever made. Roland Emmerich has attempted to do the same with ""The Patriot."" By showing the strain the war put on family and friends, he has succeeded valiantly. He also succeeds in creating some of the most gruesome and horrific battle sequences ever put on film. At one point, I found my stomach starting to churn in disgust.As the father of the film, Gibson is concerned what his young children have seen him do. Likewise parents should be concerned if their young children see this film. It is bloody and grusome. Hand-to-hand combat is extremely vivid. Children are shot, stabbed, and burned to death. There are hangings and firing squads. This film does not withhold any of the horror of war, which is why it received the R rating.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Not your average review,"The Patriot is worth seeing for several reasons. It has great acting, I was thrilled to see Heath Ledger given a bigger role, and allowed the chance to prove that he could carry it off (which he did with style and ease). Of course Mel Gibson was fantastic (I would be surprised to get less from him), but my main point of writing is to tell you what no one else here has (yet). This movie is not a ""feel good"" film. I didn't walk out of the theater thinking how entertained I was, or how happy I was to be alive. I walked out wondering if it would be better if we were all dead. Those people that found Braveheart to be entertaining will find this to be so as well. However, I am getting slightly tired of writers (directors?) who think that the ""bad guy"" has to be more than bad... You know, after he murders an innocent child, I think everyone was sufficiently ready and happy to see him die, must he get worse? As if the murder of one child isn't enough for us, the writer feels if the ""bad guy"" doesn't just KEEP doing horrendous acts, we might not feel he needs to die. Must he top every horrible act with one more gruesome and depressing to the audience? Every time the movie gave me hope that some semblance of happiness or justice might come out of the show, it tore it away in the most cruel manner. Every time I started to smile at the scenes of loyalty and love, I was stunned and shocked back into my state of horror, and despair for those in the movie. When it was over, unlike the teenage boys sitting in front of me talking excitedly about how much blood there was, I felt numb. The acting was superb, the sets and costumes lovely and the filmography, fantastic. The story left me numb by the end and today, when I think of it, I wish I hadn't seen it. A lot of reviewers (professional and otherwise) like movies full of despair and without hope when they are done well.

Oh where would we be without Gibson potraying us as Nazi's.,"Yes I'm English. I'm also a student of History. Which means I feel that I have a right to call this the biggest pile of tosh that I have seen. I should have expected the English soldiers not to be potrayed in a nice light, as it is directed by Mel Gibson, and will include his dislike/hatred of the English (Braveheart was similarly biased, though not too badly, though Gallipoli was just an insult to English soldiers), but I wasn't expecting the average redcoated soldier who was simply doing his job, to be shown as a mass murdering fiend who went around setting fire to churches with people inside. that particular event happened, though it was done by a group of American militia, who locked and set fire to a church with Virginian loyalist families inside. none of the atrocities dedicated to the British soldiers EVER happened. The War just wasn't like that. Personally, I think America was in the Right in trying to gain its Independence, but it was over the ridiculously high taxes imposed on the citizenry to fund an American continent army to fight the French in Canada, and not over ""Freedom"" which they alreay had to a large extent, and DEFINATELY not over slavery, for which most, including the main character Benjamin Martin (In real life he was Daniel Morgan), did not care about. He actually owned a number of slaves, bet you didn't know that. I think its insulting to the black population of America, because the result of the war was that slavery was still in practice long after it was banned in the British Empire. bet you didn't know that either. Bet you didn't know that the English baddie who murdered all those surrendering troops, in actual fact never murdered POW's in real life.So Kudos to Mel Gibson for altering history to make himself look like the man who won the War of Independence, and to making the British soldiers (and there were Scottish, Welsh and Irish soldiers fighting there as well, which the director of Braveheart forgot to include in this film).And before any of you out there say something like ""Well, we still won limey"" just remember that I think America was in the right in the whole war. I just don't like bald faced lies.",1.0,Anonymous,History
An example of how TRULY good acting is what makes the film.,"Although this movie was neither historically accurate nor too out of the ordinary creative wise, ""The Patriot"" remains a movie well worth the admission price.  Personally I am there to be entertained, and if the facts have to be skewed (as history does ANYWAY folks) in order for me to have a good time, so be it.  Nobody said this was a documentary.  The acting was superb.  Mel Gibson (Benjamin)was stellar as a revolutionary war hero, striking emotion straight into the heart and mind of the viewer.  Heath Ledger stole the show as Ben's son Gabriel. The flow of his acting style never falters.  These two fine individuals did an amazing job with a worn-over script that should have hit the dirt hours ago.  Even the villain, in particular Jason Issac, was incredible.  Not many actors can take a role so vile and conniving and evoke such emotion to keep one satisfied.  And talk about support!  The children, in particular the two sons and the youngest daughter, exceptionally livened up the show.  I can't wait to see more films with the bravado these talented thespians exalted.  Now, the downers...Yes, some parts of the show were unrealistic, and fine detailing such as better attention to the era historically or even more English accents would have been appreciated.  Many parts were predictable, but I suppose most movies are nowadays.(One thing that did surprise me was how the Frenchman didn't criticise Benjamin's French oratory skills!) The love-story element was there, but at least they didn't go overboard with it.  The bloodiness could have been lessened, but war isn't exactly squeaky clean. Also if anyone came out hating the British after seeing the movie, I think you missed the point...the director did attempt to show conflict over the issues concerning and surrounding the war.  This sadly was not done to perfection as it very well could have been.  However, ""The Patriot"" remains basically an action movie with a message.  After seeing this movie I had something to talk about, which is more than I can say for the plethora of dull, quick money films the industry has wheeled out lately.  I'd give it an 8 for effort.",,Anonymous,History

Then charging with bayonets. It's kinda cool at least for a film. The military fighting scene was good.If you are a person who care about history and good plot then this movie may not be for you.

William Tavington--Is quite believable and is the best on screen villain I have seen in a long time...One other name that I know you want to remember is Heath Ledger--he plays Gibson's oldest son Gabriel and he's hungry to see battle in the American Revolution...He reminds me a lot of  Chris O'Donnell, and should be a name that will be around for years to come...I want everyone to know, that if you go to the movies only once this summer, put 'The Patriot' high up on your list of films to see...I know those who see this film will enjoy it a lot...Its just a shame that there aren't many films that are made on The American Revolution, because it was one of the most exciting points in our history...I believe I read in a newspaper recently that there were ONLY 10 movies that were made that had to do with the American Revolution...I believe that movies can be used as educational tools, and a film like this one would be a perfect tool to use in U.S. history classes if they're studying the American Revolution...But go see this film, just because it is an excellent film, and is definitely worth the money...You will enjoy it a lot...",8.0,Anonymous,History

To put the behaviour of an British Officer (historically a colonial i.e. American) in such a context is not only historically untrue but highly unethical. I was frankly disgusted and outraged.

Gibson got $25 million for this???,"""The Patriot"" is a mediocre movie with a predictable plot.  It's beautifully shot, but were everyone's teeth that good during the Revolutionary war?  I suppose this movie will go down in history as the first one where the star got $25,000,000 for making the film.I was a little shocked at how cardboard-thin all of the characters were, and how corny and ultra-predictable the ending was.  Gibson has done some great roles, but this is not one of them.  He did it for the money folks!  Let's face it, this whole movie was made for the money.  There is not an artistic bone in this movie's body.  The seen where the Redcoats lock up the inhabitants of a small town in the town's church, and then burn the church down with everyone inside, was so over-the-top that instead of being a horrific scene, it just made me go ""Yeah right, like that REALLY happened.

War in your own back yard is so different from a conflict miles or continents away.  Once you are forced todefend your family and country, normal rules of decency vaporize rapidly. There is no such thing as decent war.Acts of brutality have occurred on both sides.  Seeing a movie like this makes me want to research the history of the revolution.

The First Great Revolutionary War Film!,"Considering the amount of time and money that Hollywood has invested in chronicling America's other wars on film, it is surprising that it has taken nearly a century to create the first great film about the Revolutionary War. The Patriot is a stirring epic that is historically accurate while remaining thoroughly entertaining (what happens to Martin's family actually happened to a number of the signers of the Declaration).  Mel Gibson gives one of his strongest performances as Benjamin Martin, a widower and former war hero who strives to protect his family from the horrors of war.  And as his son, Gabriel, Heath Ledger comes into his own following the promise he showed in his breakthrough performance in ""10 Things I Hate About You""  The acting is uniformly strong, the effects terrific, and the visuals gorgeous. While the film is weighted down by a couple of clichéd themes (the black man fighting for his freedom and the white man who learns to respect him for doing so...I don't know if there was a certain amount of irony intended in this, but even so, it's a pointless sub-theme).  While there are some gory war scenes, ""The Patriot"" is really an honest love story between a father and his family, and is well worth the admission price.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Pretty bad,"To be fair some of the action/battle sequences are good, but my God it's nauseating at times. Mel Gibson uses the American flag to dismount the main villain from his horse, he waves it about in slow motion to bad music to 'inspire' to rebels to keep on fighting in the climatic battle, and he has black people working on his farm in South Carolina but they're not slaves of course they're more like modern-day employees who actually want to work there(!). The white rebel racist ends up as the best friend of a freed slave (who himself has suddenly fallen in love with the rebels who kept him as a slave in the first place), when 'Mel'asks Jodie Foster if he can sit down next to her she replies 'It's a free country... or at least it will be' (talk about vomit inducing), and this whole thing about Mel Gibson being a patriot is nonsense - he joined the revolutionary cause to get revenge for his son, not out of feelings of patriotism. And I never understood why rebels were called patriots anyway, surely the Loyalists were the patriots. Finally there's the thing about the British soldiers being portrayed carrying out acts of genocide which the Nazi's would've been proud of. This is so offensive words can hardly describe. Oh... and hardly any of the actors are that good (ironically the two which most stand out are British - Jason Isaacs and Tom Wilkinson). This film has a (very) small number of positive attributes, but overall it's stomach-churning drivel which, unfortunately, some people WILL take to be historically accurate.",1.0,Anonymous,History
There is something wrong with this movie,"There is something wrong with this movie. Not that it is badly made or lacking in production values. Indeed, all that money can buy has been generously bestowed on it and, if you are willing to disregard certain things, you will probably spend a good evening. But certain things simply cannot be ignored.The problem, as others have said, is one of historical truthfulness. Not that one should be too pedantic about the details history : I see nothing inherently wrong in inventing characters and refashioning events, when this is well-done. What, however, is wrong, very wrong, is to accuse people of the past of crimes they did not commit. Nobody will dispute that there is a streak of ruthlessness in the British character and that, during the American Revolution, history records many instances of confiscation, looting and destruction of insurgentsÕ property by British troops, as well as hangings of people actively involved in the patriotic cause. At the same time, that ruthlessness had limits and to suggest that  atrocities such as those described in the latter part of the film (systematic slaughter of innocent civilians, including the entire population of a village) could have been been perpetrated by British officers, let alone condoned, if only tacitly, by Lord Cornwallis, is a calculated insult to a great nation to which America owes its deepest cultural roots and which remains one of its closest allies. Furthermore, in the film, those scenes of atrocities are utterly useless, for, already within three minutes of his first appearance, Tavington has done more than enough (and within the limits of the harsh rules of war as they were understood at the time) to fuel Ben MartinÕs spirit of revenge for the rest of the film - and a spinoff TV series, if they care to make one.Another major problem with THE PATRIOT relates to the rather dubious brand of patriotism which it preaches. Once upon a time, Hollywood knew how to make films celebrating the love of America in such a way as to infectiously communicate it to millions throughout the world. Think of such fine productions as SERGEANT YORK, ABE LINCOLN IN ILLINOIS, MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON, among numerous others. Alas, it seems that the recipe has since been lost and that the only forms of expression of patriotism known to contemporary American movie studios are loud, vulgar and unimaginative. Truly, there must be more subtle ways to advertise the love of the US than to wave the Star-Spangled Banner to the sound of blaring fanfares over and over again!...The most questionable aspect of that newfangled patriotism is its utter insensitivity to the feelings of people of other nations, whose lives are presented as expendable (think of the many tasteless jokes about redcoat-killing in THE PATRIOT...), whereas American lives are treated as sacred and infinitely precious - as if only Americans were fully human... Such a view is both offensive and morally repulsive. I suggest that American movie producers make it a priority to look for ways more respectful of human dignity to enhance a national patriotism which can otherwise be so admirable, and especially for the way in which it succeeds in transcending ethnic and racial differences.PS For the record : Lord Cornwallis was not an elderly military genius, as depicted in the film, but a YOUNG man (born in 1738, he was not yet 43 when he surrendered at Yorktown...), who owed his position more to his birth than to his professional competence, as well as a liberal gentleman who, in subsequent years, did much for the advancement of the civil rights of Irish Catholics (THAT should be of some interest to Mr. Gibson!)",,Anonymous,History

Many British Generals and British soldiers even refused to fight in the War of 1776 because they did not want to war against their 'brothers' so why would they burn and attack their 'brothers' ???? Another thing that made me laugh was the white soldier saying to the Black soldier 'its been a honour fighting with you' LOL LOL LOL .Were Americans not ashamed when they saw that part of the movie and the ending when it showed the black men and whites living together happily(LOL)Lets get something straight on this.Great Britain abolished slavery in 1807 , the US abolished slavery in 1865.Surely some americans would have seen something wrong with those scenes with the Whites and Blacks( i bet blacks americans would have) Other scenes that annoyed me,Mel gibson and his sons killing a column of British soldiers,why did the Americans even need an army they could have just sent families out in groups of 3 to kill the British.Also one that might even annoy the French when Martin(Gibson) says 'Our French allies finally arrived' The French helped the US to get revenge on the British and considerig that the US needed the French more than france needed the US, they can turn up when they want.I will not bother going into to Battle Scenes although they were very impressive.Why did the makers have to make the British look so evil and distort the truth??

Who wrote the script? Twelve monkeys locked in a room?,"""The Patriot"", another piece of Hollywood c**p which audiences ate up. This is by far and away one of the worst movies I've seen in the last ten years. First off, why is it called ""The Patriot""? Mel Gibson's character only fights because his son is killed, not because he wants to defend the land which he lives in. The protagonist is a typical one dimensional cold hearted guy with a British accent and that's about it. Speaking of the British, I don't have a problem with bending events/history to improve a story/themes, but Roland Emmerich just twisted facts so that the audience would hate the British and feel proud to be Americans every time Gibson shot one of them. The aspect of the movie which really left me scratching my head, besides the hokey story and terrible acting, was the end when everyone came back to rebuild Gibson's house. This must have been the most unrealistic part of the film. You better believe after the war these people would have been getting drunk and having sex, not building a house. I also thought that the ending depicted the soldiers as slaves or rather was a plug for Fascist government. Sure it put a tear and some people's eyes when they came back to build the house, but think about it, it's like they are tied to their master Gibson and can't break away from him; the end was like the slaves returning home out of the goodness of their hearts.

"Severely flawed in it's whitewashing of history, but exciting and highly entertaining","This film came out around the same time as star Mel Gibson's ""Braveheart"" and I remember people thinking he'd directed this film as well, particularly because of savage battle scenes. However, ""The Patriot"" was directed by Roland Emmerich, the reliable producer/writer/director of many enjoyable but empty headed summer popcorn films, including ""Independence Day,"" ""White House Down,"" and ""Stargate."" While most of his films are unchallenging crowd pleasers, ""The Patriot"" stands apart in his filmography as quality piece of filmmaking. The film was written by Robert Rodat, who also wrote ""Saving Private Ryan,"" and he brings the same mix of realism and and emotion to the American Revolutionary War that he brought to WWII. Mel Gibson plays a farmer and retired war hero who wants nothing more than to left alone with his family and to run his farm. However, Gibson is pushed to his limits by Jason Isaacs, best known as the sneering Lucius Malfoy in the Harry Potter films, who play as a sneering British Colonel. Gibson's fictional Benjamin Martin is an amalgam of several Revolutionary War heroes, but primarily seems to be based upon Francis Marion, The Swamp Fox, who was a pivotal figure during the war, leading a group of irregular soldiers in a guerrilla war against the British in South Carolina, even after the Continental Army had been driven out the state. After Gibson's son, Heath Ledger, is captured by Issacs, Gibson leads his own ragtag band of soldiers against the redcoats using what was at the time was very unusual guerrilla tactics. The small and large scale action sequences in ""The Patriot"" are the real highlight of the film. They are exciting, brutally realistic, and most importantly, are emotionally poignant. There is an early scene in the film when Gibson ambushes a British detail to free his captured son, Ledger, where he uses his very young sons as his soldiers, and the filmmakers don't shy away from the young children's shock at their father telling them how to kill men, as well as taking time to show the aftermath and their reaction to their father's brutality. Besides being and exciting and unflinching in it's graphic and realistic presentation of war, it's the emotional component that elevates ""The Patriot"" from simply being a technically effective crafted battle sequence. However, although the film does a fine job of presenting a realistic depiction of war for this time period and also does an excellent job of period detail in terms of costumes, architecture, and set decor, the film grossly fails in it's whitewashing of history in an attempt to present a politically correct hero who's more palatable to audiences.. As I said before, ""The Patriot"" is a work of fiction, but having Gibson's Martin ""paying"" his black farmworkers instead of owning slaves seems wildly disingenuous (Francis Marion owned slaves). Additionally, the real-life Francis Marion committed many war atrocities, even by the standards of his time, which are completely absent in this film, although there are hints of something in Gibson's past during the French and Indian War. If ""The Patriot"" had been as honest in it's depiction of history in these respects as it had been in it's depiction of warfare, this film may have been a true classic. Despite this major lapse, ""The Patriot"" remains a strong piece of filmmaking, with an emotional center that focuses around family, which gives the film a resonance that is lacking from many war films. Well worth watching despite it's flaws.",8.0,Anonymous,History

This film is well worth the money to see but bring a tushy cushion as it is long, runtime 2:40:00. Good job to all involved, you do this American proud!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Prehaps the worst movie I've seen in the last 10 years,"This was the most over long, not good enough to be a TV mini-series (except in length), piece of garbage. I found it to be manipulative, sentimental tripe. Historically it was simply ridiculous. 2 3/4 hours I'll never get back. Mel Gibson can get any movie made if they'll make ""The Patriot"". The idea that the British were on a level of evil with the Nazis is idiotic. Setting this movie in the Carolinas, where there was 50% black slave population and then not even adressing the issue, again shows a level of ignorance that is really startling. It's like they made this junk up as they went along. I suppose Gibson is so well established and the audience so ignorant he can get away with it.",1.0,Anonymous,History
very exciting,"Although I did not want to see the movie originally, I have to admit that I am glad I did.  By far, it is the best movie so far this summer.  The movie never stops entertaining whether it be action or comedy.  It was just great. Mel Gibson, again, makes an incredible performance, and Heath Ledger exceeded all of my expectations.

Oscar material,"The Patriot is a great movie that definitely deserves to be at least considered in the race for the Oscars. I think it could have won also the Golden Globes. Don't get me wrong, i liked Gladiator very much, but this one is at least as good as Crowe's film.I think it's useless for me to tell you the story: you probably already know it. Just let me tell you that i was totally sursrised by the touching way this movie was done. It's awesome, it doesn't even allow you to blink, it makes you cry, smile, but most of all admire everything on screen.Mel Gibson plays great a difficult role. He is just like he has to be, and - my opinion - better than in Braveheart.But the huge surprise comes from Ronald Emerich. A director that started with normal SciFi's, then he specialised in destroying american cities (Washington in Independence Day, LA in Godzilla), now with The Patriot, he enters in the category of really great directors. He created a surprisingly touching and sensitive film, also spectacular and entertaining.This is definetely one of the best movies of 2000, if not the best one.

American Braveheart,"Mel Gibson stars in this year's Braveheart, The Patriot,directed and produced by the two guys that brought ID4 and Godzilla. It also stars Heath Ledger, Joely Richardson, and Chris Cooper. Gibson plays Benjamin Martin, a French and Indian war hero, father of seven, who doesn't want to fight in this war but when the war comes home, the only thing he can do is fight. And if you've seen a Mel Gibson action film, when something happens to his loved one he goes crazy, real crazy. The film is a very good history lesson in the Revolutionary War. It goes over a lot of historical moments and talks about a lot of people. This isn't a war movie without battle scenes and they are intense. They are extremely bloody and get the ""war is violent"" point across very well. They have a John Woo type quality to them(a lot of slow motion). Mel does what Mel does best, good acting, brings a coolness to the screen and kicks a lot of butt. Heath Ledger does a good job as well as Gibson's oldest son. He proves that he can do a big budget action film and can hold his own with a huge superstar. The one thing The Patriot falls short in is the dramatic gaps between the action. They run very long and make this film longer than it should be. The Patriot is a fantastic film that is a must see but it's  long(over 2 and a half hours) and one very bloody film.",9.0,Anonymous,History
One of the worst films ever made. Seriously.,"Whenever I ask friends what their favorite film of all time is, I always try to follow up by asking what they would consider their most unfavorite film as well. The answers can be very telling. My least favorite film is Mel Gibson's ""The Patriot"". Aside from a complete and utter disregard for historical accuracy, it is so obvious and ridiculous in its manipulation of hokey emotionality, that I can only imagine that it will go down in history as one of the worst films ever made. Among my strongest complaints: 1 - ""The Dragoon"" suffers from the overblown, overwritten, overevil, scenery chewing villain complex unexcelled in the history of cinema, even as Mel Gibson villains go. Honestly, I would not have been surprised in the least if he had demanded to be brought a box of kittens, puppies and baby ducks, and then jumped up and down on the box, in slow motion, allthewhile cackling maniacally. To prove his evilness, he has an entire congregation locked into a church, and then has the church burned to the ground, to teach the rebels a lesson. The church literally burns completely down, but then in the ashes, one character finds a silver necklace, to prove that his love has died in the holocaust. Actually, the necklace must have been made of titanium, as it did not melt, or even scorch in the firestorm. 2 - Gibson's Ninja Children. When Gibson's oldest son is arrested, he and his several dozen motherless children go into the woods on a rescue mission, after one bit of instruction ""Aim low, aim slow"", the children are transformed into perfect marksmen, unaffected by the multiple killings each of them commits. Every shot kills a soldier, and not one of them gets the slightest scratch, or shows any emotion at having killed people.Oh, I could go on, but even thinking of this trainwreck gives me such a headache that I really ought to stop.",1.0,Anonymous,History
"Enjoyable, but easily the worst of Gibson's war epics.","Rating: ** 1/2 out of ****Everything about The Patriot screams epic: the cinematography, the battle scenes, the score, the costumes, the sets, everything that is except for the script, which relies so much on overused clichés that some scenes are even a little painful to watch. Did we really need the subplot involving the little girl who won't talk to her father? Or the relationship between the racist and the slave and its contrived, ""Hollywood"" resolution? The basic story sounds just fine, a father who must join the Revolutionary War to protect his son, but director Roland Emmerich and writer Robert Rodat felt the need to tackle as many ""issues"" as possible to make this a true epic saga.It's too bad the screenplay lets the movie down because The Patriot is noteworthy in many respects. Mel Gibson delivers another terrific performance, quite effortlessly, too. This type of character, the revenge-driven family man, is dangerously becoming a stereotype for Gibson (the family man stuff is still in both We Were Soldiers and Signs, sans the revenge). Jason Isaacs proves to be his equal as the delightfully nasty Colonel Tavington, a rather cartoonish role but played with zeal and fervor by the talented and underrated Isaacs. Heath Ledger makes his breakout performance here, but I fail to see what the hype was all about; he's flat and dull, though he's shown marked improvement recently in The Four Feathers.The Patriot features two memorable action sequences, the first is a hair-raising, heart-pounding forest ambush that had me thinking the film would be daring to enter realms Hollywood usually strayed from. Silly me, the rest of the movie was pure Hollywood and seemed to forget all about the at best ambiguous behavior of Gibson's character during the forest attack. The final bloody battle sequence is appropriately rousing, thanks to the well-choreographed mayhem and John Williams' stirring score, but concludes on a somewhat pathetic note, as a certain character suddenly appears to grow eyes on the back of his head (you'll know what I mean when you see it). These first-rate action scenes deserve to support a better, more even film.Before The Patriot, there was the immensely superior Braveheart, a gripping epic that delivered genuine passion, heart, and rousing battle scenes that made the three hour running time fly by. After The Patriot came We Were Soldiers, a riveting look at modern warfare, and its combat scenes were among the best of its kind. So The Patriot qualifies as a bridge between two superior motion pictures. Since it's a crowdpleaser, I have no doubt many crowds will be pleased. But realize that clichés can never be an apt substitute for real drama.",,Anonymous,History
"Hard to watch, but true to the subject matter (war)","This is one movie I will not see again.  Not because it was poorly done, but because it was very difficult to watch.  To its credit, it was very frank in its handling of the subject of war, and how war does not discriminate who it hurts or how or when or why.  It just hurts.  A lot.If you do not have difficulty with frank violence, I highly recommend this movie.

And with no taste or respect for anything.To sum it up: this movie made me sick to the stomach. I strongly advise you not to see it.

Historically Inaccurate Tripe,"This movie makes anyone who's ever opened a history book wince in pain. If this was your only source of American history, it would have you believe that after a spectacular battle at what I assume was ""William Wallace Hill"" or something like that (seeing as how nothing like it ever happened), the noble American army pushed back the barbarian horde that was the British forces. This in turn led to Cornwallis falling on his sword in shame and, subsequently, all the slaves were freed (ALL of them).Before watching this movie, keep some things in mind:1. George Washington was a MAJOR CAUSE of the French and Indian War.2. Little to no slaves were emancipated as a result of the revolution and those that were, returned to ENGLAND with the British forces.3. The British army strictly adhered to the Rules of War; the American army resorted to guerilla tactics such as burning towns and attacking at night (and even on Christmas, a traditional day of cease-fire).4.

Ridiculous.,"Before entering the theater to see ""The Patriot"", I wanted it to be a good movie.  Half an hour in to the movie, I wanted it to be over. A conscious effort was made to make the movie as contrary to actual history as possible.  Why?  The actual motives and actions of the people involved in the American War of Independence are far more interesting and noteworthy than the ridiculously over-dramatic characters hoaking their way through the too-long story-line and unfocused plot of this movie. Please understand, I respect Mel Gibson and I am very willing to overlook ahistorical cinema for the sake of a good movie.  I enjoy ""Braveheart"", ""Henry V"", ""The Last of the Mohicans"", etc.  However, none of these movies are interrupted by a ridiculous beach marriage scene that has nothing to do with the plot.  I know everybody else likes ""The Patriot"", but as one of the characters says in that beach scene, ""It's a free country.""",1.0,Anonymous,History
Blunt yet sophisticated,"Leaving accuracy and bias aside, there are two kinds of movies based on history. Some are good for entertainment and gives a basic explanation of why and how a event happened, leaving out and changing many details. Others are more sophisticated, trying to give us every detail and every angle on how it happened.This is a ""sophisticated"" recreation. The direction is sophisticated. The choice of scenery for each dramatic moment is nothing but perfect, and there are plenty of beautiful stray visuals in between. The acting is sophisticated, understated yet clear and as sharply directed as the subject requires. And the buildings, weapons, uniforms and other costumes are recreated with consistency, leaving nothing off because of budget limitations.And yet it's strikingly blunt.It's blunt in it's storyline, relying on ""generic basic archetypes"" to tell us what happened to the typical soldiers of each side and group, the typical black ex-slave, the typical women, the children etc. It's blunt in it's narrative, using devices like slow-motion in the middle of battles, drawn-out ""NOOOOO!!"" pleads and sudden changes of music to beat us over the head with something important and tragic happening.It's blunt in the point it makes, never showing anything to suggest why someone would not pick up the fight-even as Gibson's character himself expresses dislike for it early in the movie, noone could possibly avoid thinking it's just so we can see him change his stand soon. And, it's blunt in it's depiction of the English-American conflict.""Why do people believe they can justify death?"", Gibson's character says nearing the final battle, asking why the English army does what they are doing to the American people. Nothing in the movie gives any explanation to that either. The viewer comes out completely ignorant about the roots of the conflict, why it became violent or even what exactly the rebels were fighting for.We know nothing about the British Empire or what exactly they want to kill all those innocent people for. The only message one really gets, is that it's okay to go one-against-40 with a troop of highly trained soldiers using nothing but a rifle and a steak knife, if you've seen a mean-eyed officer kill your son in front of the rest of your family. So as a political message, the movie comes off as almost completely impotent - there is nothing in real life, in the current world that this movie can be said to openly take a stand against.Also, a sudden angle change about two-thirds through with a long, pointless and emotionless wedding scene and low-brow ""humour"" does further to enchance the pointlessness of this movie.Yet the visual imprint of the movie is strong and sophisticated, just because of the brilliant images and scenery. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys artful photography as well as excellent battle recreations, but don't expect too much of the plot.",,Anonymous,History

Moving...Heartbreaking...Brilliant!!,"This movie is one of, if not THE most brilliant movie I've ever seen! The screenwriters were obviously trying to show the harsh reality of the Revolutionary War, showing women and children being killed along with the soldiers. The scenery was incredible, the music score breathtaking!But note, behind the ""Action Epic"" exterior of the film, there is a heartbreaking story underneath. Although the previews may not show it, nearly EVERY emotion the human body has, will be expressed while watching this film: Rage and fury were expressed most by me when British officers put the innocent to death right before the eyes of their loved ones; along with sadness and sympathy (shall I say flowing tears?) when the characters you loved were unexpectedly killed. This movie is not a predictable war story, where the ""good guy always wins"" ... Although the monsters in the story get what's coming to them, the good guys have definitely lost something.Mel Gibson is FABULOUS! The whole movie is you seeing out of his eyes...You see the horrors he sees and feel the anger he feels. Heath Ledger was the reason I saw this movie, and it was definitely worth it. Both actors were incredible!I'd say that this film is for the 15+ audience, for it is extremely violent and graphic, but with NO swearing (2 words at the most) and no sex (although, romance certainly blossoms). The camera work in the film is Oscar-worthy! The battle scenes show constant impaling, decapitations, and endless bloodshed. The scenes can easily be compared to those of Saving Private Ryan: both films written by Robert Rodat.I give this movie a definite 4 stars!

Incredibly Great Movie,"It is very easy to criticize, lampoon or scold movies by Roland Emmerich ß his works are often out-of-the-real-world, too bombastic or unreal. But he does his job well and he is great as a director in The Patriot.This is the movie that I am never tired of watching again and again. Everything here is almost impeccable and incredible. Mel Gibson as Benjamin Martin is the best possible choice for this great heroic role, as well untimely passed away Heath Ledger as his son. Also, Chris Cooper is unbeatable in his part, and Tom Wilkinson is over the sky as General Cornwallis. There are many great actors here, and I think that the whole line-up is very very good. The battle scenes are made with a sheer touch of a genius and are very realistic and blood-chilling. Some humorous touches are also vivid and present and make the movie somewhat warmer and dearer. One can easily go down to the minutest details and criticize the inaccuracies, but they are all invisible when you sit and enjoy a very decent work, and 2 hours + fly very fast.

"Masterfully written&directed,brilliant cast and true English Redcoats","Not so many movies tackle this part of the American history/world history.The script and plot are far more subtle than some would have it.For instance, look at and listen closely to the convention held in Charleston at the beginning of the picture. It is magnificent drama and magnificently rhetorical indeed (a treat!!) . Mel Gibson is overwhelmingly brilliant. ""Would you tell me please, Mr. Howard,Why should I trade one tyrant 3000 miles away for 3000 tyrants one mile away?"" (Mel Gibson's ""why""is still echoing..). I find no weakness in the plot, of course some are ill at ease with good sentiments and patriotism, but the film is much more than that. The encounter with Cornwallis (Tom Wilkinson is ever so impressive)is superb. The stark contrast between the English side and the American one may seem a caricature, but I am convinced it does reflect the profound differences that could be found at that time. As for the cast, the fact that all the red coats are played by English actors enhances the quality of the whole undertaking. The French actor Tcheky Karyo also adds to the compelling dimension of the film. Every part is brilliantly acted and we must not underestimate the quality of the performance of Heath Ledger or that of the colonel of the British cavalry. Watching this film only once is a crime.

Hero Holds Family Together,"The film begins with Benjamin Martin, played by Mel Gibson, foreseeing the coming of the Revolutionary War. Martin was a hero for the Americans in the French and Indian War and has a personal knowledge of what war is like. While he supports the ideals of the rebels, Martin does not support the war because he fears for his family. One of Martin's sons is then killed by a British Colonel (Jason Isaacs), and this inspires him to join the war effort. Martin and his eldest son form a militia and carry out a series of guerrilla-style attacks on the British. Martin is motivated by revenge on the Colonel and the film culminates in a battle between Martin and the Colonel.The central idea of the film is to show how war affects people on an individual level rather than on a broader scale, and this approach is very effective. It presents Martin as a man who struggles to hold his family together in the midst of a war. Within the family, the movie focuses on the father-son relationship between Martin and his eldest son, Gabriel, played by Heath Ledger. Through the battles that they fight side-by-side and in their conversation about love, Benjamin and Gabriel become closer than they had ever been. This theme of the family is an aspect to which everyone can relate and allows ""The Patriot"" to hit close to home.Many elements of the film are outstanding, including the director's use of the beautiful South Carolina countryside. Also, many scenes are shot at dusk, which causes the viewer to pay more attention to detail. The casting is excellent-Gibson appears to have a connection with the children that only a real father could portray. Especially commendable is the way in which the director uses camera shots to focus on what he wants the viewer to see. Many times in this movie the actions between the characters show us more about their relationships than does the dialogue. ""The Patriot"" uses these aspects and more to superbly show the effect that the American Revolution had on this family.",8.0,Anonymous,History

As for the acting, this is the type of movie that Mel does best. I can also say that the supporting cast was great too. The children, even though their part was small, did a great job to make you love them, where as the villains made us hate them beyond belief.

The Propagandist,"...""Braveheart"" take two could be an alternative title. But really, ""The Propagandist"" would be most apt, since this laughable ""history"" is some of the most virulent Anglophobic claptrap I have ever seen. All the blatant inaccuracy of Revere's famous Boston Massacre engraving seems to be the approach, i.e., forget the facts, just hate the Brits! I couldn't decide if the cartoon characters shown as the Brits were more one-dimensionally stupid or one-dimensionally bloodthirsty. Oops! Maybe I've missed some unexpected character development in a Gibson flick - the Brits really were two-dimensional: stupid AND bloodthirsty.And gee, what a ""good massuh"" Gibson's character was to his slaves - they all loved him. Kind of makes you want to be a slave and wonder what all that abolitionist nonsense was about! Can anyone even begin to believe how mangled the facts are in this mess of a film? Turning regular British soldiers into incessant civilian-murdering thugs may have been what one would expect of a period propagandist like Paul Revere, but surely we ought to expect a bit more truth and enlightened approach these days. And the watering down of the hateful institution of slavery, practiced by these ""patriots"", just sidesteps an historical dilemma we Amercians ought to be coming to grips with some day.I am also very tired of the untruthful clichés in supposed historical films, and I thought the American public would be too at this point. What is really disappointing to me is that some of my countrymen are so sheepishly jingoistic that they'll get caught up in this ""hooray for the red white and blue"" mentality and like this film, despite what trash it really is.For example, if these film makers had made a brand new Western showing the old clichés - the peaceful, civilized, settlers getting massacred by the savage, bloodthirsty Indians - the film would have been hooted out of the theater. But somehow, because it is so ""patriotic"" to support the American revolution, and fashionable in some quarters to think badly of the Brits, we accept the same level of outrageously untruthful clichés in this film.I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone who would prefer some small level of truth in their so-called historical films.

"Yea, Yeah, Yeah","Gibson was, as usual, stellar. Isaacs was a vicious, haughty, overbearing, slimy monster.  But that's where I fell out of sync with the film. I couldn't accept the hyperbole of his evil, and it soured the rest of the story for me. Cornwallis was an officer and a gentleman. In real life, he would have had the Isaacs character [Tavington?] shot at dawn. I began to wonder if that character was a pastiche of Banastre Tarleton, who had a bad reputation on that score.Too much unrelieved evil on the part of the British, and too much saintliness on the part of the Americans. The political correctness with the black men being freed and accepted as equals by the South Carolinians tore the tissue, and the rest went down the toilet.Nonetheless, I enjoyed the movie. I just wish it hadn't been billed as American history. It wasn't.  I found it inspiring and exciting, and -- bottom line: Braveheart 1776.Sandman",,Anonymous,History

Masterpiece,"""The Patriot"" is an epic historical drama war film from 2000 directed by Roland Emmerich and written by Robert Rodat. The film stars Mel Gibson, Heath Ledger, Joely Richardson, Jason Isaacs, Chris Cooper, and Tom Wilkinson. Set in Berkeley County, South Carolina, it follows Benjamin Martin (Gibson), an American colonist opposed to going to war with Great Britain but, along with his son Gabriel (Ledger), gets swept into the American Revolutionary War when his home life is disrupted, and one of his sons is murdered by a cruel British officer (Isaacs). Mel Gibson's portrayal of Benjamin Martin is both nuanced and compelling. Gibson's performance is complemented by an exceptional supporting cast, and the film's battle sequences are emotionally intense and visually stunning, depicting the brutality and chaos of war. Costuming and production design are exceptional, creating a rich and immersive experience. The cinematography beautifully captures the sweeping landscapes and the grim realities of war at the time, adding to the film's overall impact, and we get another great soundtrack from John Williams. There are many great movies about the Smerican revolution, and this is among the best. An underrated gem.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The Patriot is as good as movies get.,"This is a great movie with scenes, action and passion. Mel Gibson is fully developed as a character and he gives it his best.

"According to this banal collection of movie standards, it was Mel Gibson, not George Washington.","The Patriot is well filmed, but in the end it's just a ""politically corrected"" amalgamation of well-worn and painfully predictable Hollywood stereotypes and storylines, with scenes and plot ""twists"" lifted directly out of movies we have all seen a thousand times.  (There is a certain verisimilitude, though, imparted to the 18th Century battles scenes reminicent of the same type of ""reality"" that was brought to the D-Day landing segment of ""Saving Private Ryan"", and for this one can really gain some appreciation for what American soldiers went through during the Revolutionary War; I suspect, however,  that the true reason for this was the film makers' desire to show people's limbs being separated from their bodies by 12 pound cannonballs).So here we have Mel Gibson as a South Carolina plantation owner, widower, and loving father to seven children: a well know ""bad-ass"" from his exploits during the French and Indian War (1754-63), Southern aristocrat Gibson now does not believe in violence, and wishes only to farm in peace. (This brings to mind the Clint Eastwood character in ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"", who joins with the rebels only after his family is murdered and his farmstead burned by marauding Union troops). Gibson's politically correct plantation has no slaves, remarkably enough, but families of African-Americans happily working there of their own volition, as we are duly informed; the African-American woman who is the housekeeper and cook speaks perfect 20th Century English, and apparently can read too, since she casually examines the mail dropped off by a rider in the opening scene.  Actually, Gibson himself has no Southern accent, though some of his neighbors do.At this point the evil English officer is introduced to the movie, who promptly and cooly shoots Mel's 15 year old son to set the plot into motion. His character is identical to the English villain in ""Rob Roy"", or the Sheriff of Nottingham from Robin Hood, for that matter: the upper class accented heartless butcher, seeking to compensate for his own wretchedness and unhappiness.  Forced into action, and to return to violence, Gibson's character confesses to the atrocities he and his collegues visited upon the French during the previous war.  In previous generations a military hero would have been shown in a psoitive light; for PC Hollywood today, however, the hero's exploits are now to be reviled as sadistic and murderous: his victory is not one of courage and tactics, but of torturing captured French soldiers (who had themselves committed heinois acts).So the movie lurches on from battle to battle in predictable sequence. Some of these scenes, and indeed the climactic battle scene, seem to be directed lifted from ""Braveheart"", although with weapony slightly more advanced: hordes of men yelling and charging on broad fields with Mel in the thick of it.  Along the way the British are turned into SS troopers, more happy African-Americans are found living in African harmony somewhere near the coast (presumably of South Carolina) but speaking without the slightest trace of Southern, or African-American dialects or accents.  (A boorish white soldier in Gibson's command who scorned the black slave enlisted by his owner in Gibson's militia of course is later saved by him, and solemnly proclaims that he is ""honored"" to serve with him, lest any in the audience have missed this message).George Washington and the Continental Army get pretty short shrift in Gibson's war, but in the pivotal battle, conveniently just before Yorktown (where the British surrendered) Gibson rallies the troops 'round the flag when the lines are faltering (just before finding and facing his nemisis among the 30,000 or so present on the battlefield)and siezes victory from the jaws of defeat- the Revolution is saved, and America is born! (Not before the ""we've-seen-this-at-least-a-thousand-times-before"" fight to the finish between Gibson and the evil British officer who murdered his son(s).This scene comes directly from ""Rob Roy"" in its choreography).This movie unnecessarily demonizes the English, plays havoc with history to effect its Hollywood PC messages, disparages the accomplishments of American revolutionary soldiers and layers on tired diagloge, plot devices and sermonizing for any who have missed their ham-handed point of view.  As history it's a joke.  As a ""patriotic"" American film, it's disingenuous. As entertainment, it's only passable (barely).  It is not absolutely horrible, but that's really the best thing I can say about it, and that's rather sad.",,Anonymous,History
A Wonderful Birthday Present,"I, and quite a few other Charlestonians, saw this movie for the first time tonight.

Graphic action film that carries deep emotional weight,"It's a fine line, in film, between a scene with emotional truth and a scene set up to manipulate your emotions.  Sometimes the camera holds a little too long on a crying man's expression of grief or the musical score is a bit heavy handed.One wouldn't suppose that the director of Independence Day, Roland Emmerich, could handle the subtle balance between a serious drama and a story with graphic sweeping battle scenes.  He does.  The Patriot keeps you guessing. Often as not, the story will seem to lead in an obvious direction and then it veers off and does the unexpected.This is grand Hollywood film making that doesn't shy away with showing the carnage of battle, in both large clashes in open fields and small skirmishes, but it also touches on men and their families and a central conflict between a good man and an evil man.  Much of the film's emotional weight is carried by Mel Gibson.  There are a couple of scenes that would make even a hard boiled cynic weep.I must admit that I was concerned by the prerelease trailer showing Mel carrying a  flag into battle.  It seemed an easy way to manipulate the heartstrings of any good American.  His use of the flag, in the film, is actually far more personal and dynamic than one would expect.This is an action movie that isn't predictable and a drama that will please the serious filmgoer.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Patriotic whitewash,"The British do not fare well in Mel Gibson movies. 'Braveheart' made effete treachery, murder and blackmail seem like the main British virtues. In 'The Patriot' British soldiers shoot wounded prisoners, execute civilians, commit mass murder and generally nasty up the landscape. The American militia fighters are saints by comparison.Was the Revolutionary War really this horrible in South Carolina? There were elements of guerrilla warfare and civil war in that conflict, but I doubt if the British were as bad as portrayed in 'The Patriot.' It seems Hollywood movies today are not content with giving us conventional bad guys. They have to give us human flesh-eating serial killers (Hannibal) or military psychopaths like the British in 'The Patriot.'Still ... the real groaner in 'The Patriot' is the way it distorts reality on the touchy question of slavery. After all, Hollywood can't make Mel a hero with feet of clay. They can't glamorize colonial America's fight for freedom while accurately portraying the slavery that made the Founding Fathers hypocrites.Here I am on solid ground, since I recently read ""Slaves in the Family."" The book details the lives of a South Carolina plantation family and their slaves from colonial days to the present. Slaves in South Carolina were treated worse than draft animals -- bought and sold, worked relentlessly, whipped, and punished for running away by being branded or having ears or toes amputated. For most of South Carolina's history, it was illegal to free a slave.Mel Gibson is clearly a wealthy landowner in 'The Patriot,' with a dozen or more black people working in his house and fields. Yet when passing British trooops tell his workers they are no longer slaves, one of them declares that Mel's blacks are not slaves, but free men.Huh?And later when Mel and his family are running from the British, they seek refuge in an idyllic seaside village populated entirely by black people who are obviously not slaves. Mel and his kids are given refuge by Abigale, their former housekeeper and mammy. It's a touching scene when Mel's kids are reunited with Abigale ... and as phony as anything ever filmed.The black character who gets the most screen time is a slave who fights  in Mel's guerrilla band. His master is too old to fight, so he sends a slave in his stead. Enduring the racial taunts of his ""comrades,"" the slave discovers he will be freed if he serves a year for the revolutionary cause. During that year he saves the life of one of the worst white bigots, and when his year is up he continues to fight for ""freedom.""Fat chance.'The Patriot' has some virtues as entertainment, but those are ruined for me by its completely distorted portrayal of slavery. The contradictions and glory of our Revolution deserve honest treatment.",,Anonymous,History

It's an exciting example of historical fiction,"The main foreground characters and action are mostly fiction, but the spirit of the partisan actions in the Carolinas during the Civil War is honestly stated. ""Benjamin Martin"", a veteran of the French and Indian Wars, in which he apparently committed some acts of which he is now ashamed, is reluctant to get involved in the American rebellion against British rule. He has a large family of which he is very fond and caring. When a very over zealous and sadistic British colonel murders his next to oldest son, he goes berserk. Single-handed, he kills a patrol of 20 solders and frees his captive oldest son. After that, he becomes a partisan leader and there is no stopping him.We see the English campaign in the Carolinas mostly through ""Benjamin Martin"", and we follow him to the final defeat of Cornwallis. The ""Martin"" family affairs are fiction, but there is little doubt that tragic incidents like those portrayed, i.e. house burnings, killing of civilians, etc. actually occurred. The character ""Martin"" is probably based in part on the real life partisan Francis Marion, famous as ""The Swamp Fox"". Along with several other similar guerrilla leaders, Marion dealt the redcoats some serious blows, similar to those portrayed in the film.I found this an excellent semi-docudrama, with the fictional family serving as a canvas on which to paint the hellishness of war, even in a good cause.

A glorious triumph... Roland Emmerich's masterpiece,"PATRIOT is easily my all-time favorite Mel Gibson movie (yes, I like it even better than Braveheart, even though they're both really wonderful and spectacular)... PATRIOT has more noble passion, heart, soul, honor, emotion, loyalty, character, warmth, drama, faith, romance, blood, tragedy, sacrifice, honor, dignity, and glory than Hollywood's released in years, perhaps the entire past decade.  While it is not perfect, PATRIOT is a cinematic showcase of everything movies should be!PATRIOT is always going to remain controversial; many people will love it, and far too many snobs will hate it (even refusing to see it!) Congratulations to PATRIOT's makers for having the courage to make this precious movie, especially considering how much their deluded & elite Hollywood neighbors will bash them with hatred and malice.The acting is phenomenal...everybody from Heath Ledger to the precious little daughters deliver stellar performances.  The feeling and tone are mesmerizing....stirring sensory poetry.  Cinematography too beautiful for words.If you liked Titanic, Last of the Mohicans, Glory, Braveheart, Forrest Gump, Clear & Present Danger, First Knight, and you're a fan of soap operas or historical romances, PATRIOT's right up your alley!Screenwriter Robert Rodat, Director Roland Emmerich, Producer Dean Devlin, and star Mel Gibson each top their previous career achievements here... PATRIOT may lack the financial success of their previous works, but this is a movie they can be most proud of...an accomplishment of such pure heart and soul that future generations will cherish this on video forever.  I only wish I had paid MORE money for my ticket, to help PATRIOT's Summer 2000 box-office coffers approach the levels of its certain eventual video popularity.For all of PATRIOT'S minor artistic flaws (all of which are expected for a movie - after all it is just a movie - including the hysterically snotty elitist bigotry of DH's totalitarian-fascist ranting, which hypocritically engages in revisionism and hate-filled stereotypes of its own), this movie is more genuinely heroic and emotionally sincere than I ever expected out of this Tinseltown bunch.Roland, I love ya babe!  Don't let your snobby industry rivals get you down - keep up the good work.  Millions of Americans are honored to have you as a friend, neighbor, and fellow soulmate.

Mel Gibson gives a stunning performance as a father forced to go to war during the American Revolution.  I've heard people say it was ""just like Braveheart"", but I disagree.  Without the added responsibilities of producing and directing, Mr. Gibson was free to concentrate on acting his part, and he did a job beyond expectations.  Skye McCole Bartuziak also gave a very moving (and impressive) performance as Martin's (Gibson) youngest daughter traumatized by the losses she'd endured.All in all, there wasn't anything about this movie that was bad.

And now for something not historical...,"""The Patriot"" allows Mel Gibson to portray a character very similar to his fictitious version of William Wallace from ""Braveheart"" (1995). Rather than the medieval Scottish highlands, the action this time takes place in America during the American Revolution. Mel Gibson's character, Benjamin Martin, is similar to Wallace in being motivated to fight the English after a personal loss and lead a ragtag group of soldiers.""The Patriot"" boasts great sets, shots and costumes supported by an impeccable score from John Williams. The only point against the film's cinematography is an exaggerated use of slow motion shots. As with ""Braveheart"" (1995), the story of this film cannot by any means be taken as history. The film exaggerates the virtues of the continental army and the atrocities committed by the British. If you can get past that, it's possible to enjoy this film. The story follows a good pace and the action scenes are excellent and well-staged, even if some of them are over-the-top. ""Braveheart"" (1995) exceeds ""The Patriot"" for interesting story developments and characterization, but ""The Patriot"" is still solid.Mel Gibson essentially reprises his role with William Wallace and does it with the same energy for another good performance. The members of Benjamin Martin's family are all well-played and as is Charlotte, the sister of Benjamin's dead wife. Jason Isaacs plays Colonel Tavington with smugness and audacity that would later be seen again in Lucius Malfoy of the ""Harry Potter"" films and creates a great villain. Also on the British side was Tom Wilkinson, who was enjoyable to see as the gentlemanly and proud General Cornwallis. On the revolutionary side, the supporting cast was decent. Particularly notable was Tchéky Karyo as France's representative and Rene Auberjonois of ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" fame as the preacher.

Entertaining movie about the Revolutionary War,"The Patriot is a good Revolutionary War movie but it is fiction.The story follows Benjamin Martin, a farmer in South Carolina with a checkered past whose perfect life comes crashing down in the turmoil of the American Revolutionary War. When a brutal British dragoon officer, Colonel Tavington shots one of Martin's sons in cold blood and torches his home he seeks revenge by joining a local militia. As Martin's militia disrupt British supply lines, Tavington resorts to sadistic acts of cruelty against civilians until Martin and Tavington do battle.Excellent costumes, acting, and the fact that it really is the only war movie depicting the Revolutionary War make it worth watching.The biggest grip with this movie is the historical inaccuracies. What makes it worse are that Martin and Tavington are loosely based on real people (""the Swamp Fox"" and Colonel Tarelton). First it is a movie so let's just calm down. However some of the scenes are so inaccurate it is disgusting. The fact that his African American workers are ""freemen"" and they eventually hang out with other free slaves is odd. Slavery was common in the South so dont sugarcoat it.The second topic of controversy involves supposed British atrocities especially the scene with the church. This gets the Brits in a tizzy as there are no records of British troops killing civilians in that manner. But let's not try and dim the real atrocities committed by British and allied troops and the effect it had on the American people at the time (Americans were not angels at the time either). Between 1.5 and 3% of the American population died in that war (not including civilians). Civilians, like in all wars, were murdered by enemy troops albeit not on orders from high command. Homes were ransacked regularly and put to the torch. For example, Norfolk VA and Portland ME were both bombarded and torched by the British. British and their Indian allies massacred 300 American civilians at the Battle of Wyoming, 12,000+ American POWs died on British hulk ships of deprevation and disease with a death rate in excess of American POWs in WWII. More than 100,000 Americans became refugees and fled to Canada after the war. To put these numbers in perspective, that would be equivalent to the US today losing 5 to 10 million military members, 1.5 million in POW camps, having San Francisco and Seattle completely destroyed and losing 15 to 20 million people as political refugees. This war affected Americans like no other including WWII and the Civil War. Virtually everyone in the country came into contact with enemy troops, every state had battles and suffered occupation. This is not to say the British like Nazis but the horrors of war were there as they were in most wars of the 18th century in some form or another (the Seven Years War AKA French and Indian War in the US featured plenty of horrors in Europe and America).

A simple farmer of English roots,he seeks to fight no more.The Patriot (Martin/Gibson) wants peace for the Nation, and simplicity for his family. When the British kill his young son in cold blood, he unleashes the anger of a soldier of the French/Indian warrior. Some historical facts are accurate,but mostly it is a collage(not college)of persons. A tyrant British Col. of the Dragoon Regiment, seeks to wipe out all rebels who oppose the King James. Gibson,skillfully displays his peace of life and his anger of injustice when he continually strikes a dead Redcoat. Upon finding his senses, he fordids his eldest son Gabriel, to Continue to fight against the British Red. A soldier, Martin once fought for Britain, now Martin fights against. Face it,It's unacceptable to love the United States of America. Well done, Thanks, Mel A.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Mel Gibson, more like Awesome Gibson.","Historical fiction is not easy. But this movie is fantastic, even though it may not all be 100% historically accurate, that is what historical fiction is.
Regardless of it not being fact it is still wildly important, because so many people at the time had stories like this. They lost family. They were pillaged. Loved ones died. This movie isn't a history textbook on the revoutionary war, and that doesn't take away from the overall message of the movie.
It's an incredibly important, moving story with a kick-A script. Not only is it deeply moving and important but there are some rather funny comedy interjections in the script (This could just be due to the vibe of the night of watch). My only complaint would be the sometimes goofy cheesy moments that disrupt the flow of the things.
Sad that heath ledger passed away because he's a stellar lad.
Mel Gibson is also a beast in this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,History
READ A BOOK!,"I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw one user comment refer to this film as a ""Stunning American Civil War Epic."" Yes, and ""Saving Private Ryan"" was a ""Fabulous Vietnam War Film."" Hello people! Read a book! I'll give you a hint: go back four score and seven years before the American Civil War.This film was a perfect example of today's American cinema: lush cinematography, amazing special effects, beautiful actors and no substanceno story. This cliche-ridden clap-trap goes on too long and tortures the viewer with hollow characters and emotional ""string-pulling."" The problem with most war movies (and particularly ""The Patriot"") is that they try to exalt warfare as a glorious and necessary activity. War is a horrific thing. As long as we elevate and worship warfare through the cinema it will always be with us. This movie is a nearly three-hour infommercial for the NRA.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Actually its crap like this that makes me proud Im not American.,"Its hard to believe that Mr Gibson would make the same mistake as he did when he appeared in Braveheart, but he does! When I looked at Patriot I sometimes had to close my eyes to keep myself from vomiting. In opposite to the previous writer, Id say that its extremely possible to tell the next scenes. We have seen these movies over and over and as long as they keep selling we will keep seeing them coming, but one day people will recon it for s***, grab a can of beer and rent something worth the money!",,Anonymous,History
Good but a little inaccurate,"Its a Great war movie and a nice patriotic/revenge story, but there are a few over-exaggerated historical details. (Such as British atrocities, the man the movie is based off of, etc). But if you're not there for the history and just want a patriotic movie to watch for July 4th, why not?",8.0,Anonymous,History
!!!!!,"Down right patriotic, not only an entertaining well acted film, but family values and a history lesson.  Mel at the top of his form once again.  Its a shame that family movies don't do as well as the so called PG13 movies with all the sexual content and language we could really do without.  This movie far surpasses ""the perfect storm"" in depth and character.  Yet it is falling behind the wake of it.  Oh well, some of life's pleasures are knowing where the true gems are and this is one of them, you wont be sorry if you go see it.",10.0,Anonymous,History
One of the most heart-rending movies ever made.,"I cried from begining to end the first time I saw this movie. The characters were real, the scripting was well done, and the acting was brilliant.

Revolutionary War Painting Brought To Life !,"This movie was perfection at work. Roland Emmerich put away all the aliens and huge lizards which were interesting now he has created a cinematic masterpiece that will be remembered for years to come. Every moment catches you, sucks you in like  a hurricane on rampage why? for starters Mel Gibson was at his maximum level of perfection, plot was out of this world, visual effects added so much more I felt like it was a painting brought to life each scene was perfectly put together, I felt like I was their living the revolutionary war, but the absolute story line was what blew me away it was like no other revolutionary war picture it was not about war it was about family, freedom, faith, the human spirit, and what each man gave up for this great land we call United States of America were every man & woman is free. Only thing I suggest is you watch this movie closer than you ever watched a movie you must pay attention to the small details to really appreciate this movie for its perfection.  Before closing I just must say this is what Hollywood needs more of!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Braveheart; now this? What's next? Blame England for WW2?,"First I'll say the costumes and some of the battle scenes' choreography are the only good things about this.  I was so disappointed in The Patriot.  I wanted it to be a classic but it is simply awful.  Mel Gibson, you should have known better than to have anything to do with this overly long, depressing dud.Shame on the screenwriters for playing fast and loose with so many historical facts.  Of course judging by the release of U571, Hollywood film writers see fit to rewrite history any way possible.Shame on the screenwriters for this strictly by-the-numbers story.  The bad guy is written so over-the-top evil, it's beyond laughable.  We deserve better than this turkey.  It is so bad, it makes The Postman look like Masterpiece Theatre.I got the impression the producers couldn't decide if this was supposed to be a drama, action, or some historical documentary.  The story focus bounces all over the place.  I imagined the writers had a good idea originally for a decent romance story set in 1776 but then somehow decided to turn it into a gratuitously violent anti-war, anti-British cartoon.Save your money and your precious time and rent Braveheart instead.",1.0,Anonymous,History
"good patriotic, historical fiction","For all of those critics who bash this movie for its historical inaccuracies, you have to understand that this movie never proclaimed to be a factual documentary.  It is simply BASED on events that transpired and the lives of a number of important figures during the Revolutionary War.  With this view in mind, I thought the Patriot worked very well, stirring up some much needed patriotic feeling into our cynical society of today.As far as the inaccuracies, I actually thought there were a lot more inaccuracies in Braveheart, a wonderful film with a story that bears little resemblance to the actual story of William Wallace.  For those who doubt all of the brutal tactics used by the British, the real-life British Officer Banastre Tarleton was known to be almost every bit as evil as the Tavington character in the movie.  With that said, I don't know of any event where he burned a church full of people, that might have been a little much. However, he did execute captured colonists and civilians, and was known as being astonishingly ruthless.  In real-life, Lord Cornwallis actually approved of Tarleton's tactics (the movie gave him a more positive outlook), and was so incensed after he was defeated at the Battle of Cowpens, that he chased Nathaniel Greene's army all across the Carolinas.  The result was that he eventually tired his army out and allowed Greene to make a few stands that sent Cornwallis to Yorktown.Others have complained that the movie did not show any of the brutality of the Americans.  It thought the shot of Mel Gibson repeatedly bashing the British soldier with blood all over his face and clothes, as well as the instance where the militia continued to kill British soldiers after they shouted for surrender, managed to give some of the American brutality.With that said, I did have a few problems with the movie.  There were a few scenes of laughable cheesiness, such as Heath Ledger's girlfriend standing up in church to give her speech about independence, and the mano-a-mano fight between Tavington and Martin.  I would also have liked to see more of an exploration of the internal struggle between loyalists and patriots. Also, the movie made it sound as if the slavery problem was not such a big deal-something must have happened then between the Revolution and the Civil War!  Overall, however, a well-done, beautiful (the sets and costumes seemed very authentic), & inspiring movie.  *** (out of four stars)Interesting  note: Mel Gibson, was not cast as `The Swampfox' Frances Marion (the character that Benjamin Martin was clearly based on ), because it was found that Marion spent his free-time hunting Indians!",,Anonymous,History
Historical inacurracy is NOT an issue!,"I've read tons of negative reviews about this film and I must say that the huge majority of them are completely ridiculous and groundless. This is a MOVIE. The makers of the movie NEVER made any claims as to it being historically correct. For those  people who have criticized the scene where Gibson and his sons take out 20 men and complained that this was so impossible that it was comedic. Well, if British soldiers are dumb enough to stand side by side with their fellow comrades and make themselves such an easy target on the battlefield that only an idiot could miss them than I must say that they are just as likely to stand around in the open and let themselves be butchered by an invisible enemy as they are to letting themselves be butchered w/out defense on the open field. Secondly, I can understand how foreigners (not Americans) think the patriotism was over done. For Americas this was an excellent, patriotic film that made every one PROUD to be an American especially since it opened on the 4th of July. Then there is also the slave issue. The stereotypical idea of slaves is that every single slave, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, was a miserable beaten and unhappy wretch of a human being. Certainly, there were many who led unhappy lives but there were also those who either had their freedom granted to them by the owners or those who were not treated badly. The issue of slaves, as depicted in the movie is not impossible or inconceivable. All in all, if you disregard the ridiculous claims about historical inaccuracy, it is a wonderful and excellent film. I strongly recommend this film be watched, especially by Americans.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Not a history lesson but perhaps the best movie of the year.,"A work of shear genius. The second of only two movies this year that truly hold the audience captive. This, and Gladiator are the only films of the 2000 season that fit this category.The Patriot at its base is a human story of a man trying to hold onto the remnants of his family at all cost. The backdrop being the Revolutionary War.  It is impossible to create an exactly historical film and still draw an audience.  It is after all a form of entertainment and certain things must be changed in order to provide entertainment. If I wanted a complete history I would have opened a book or watched the history channel. History is written by the victor and British history is perhaps the greatest example of this idea. This film draws from its base historical fact, showing the atrocities  of war, and the will of man.  Col. Tarlington, who is based upon a real British officer Tartlton, often called ""The Butcher"" lead his group of Green Dragoons into some of the bloodiest acts of the war. One including the slaughter of a troop of Continental army that were hacked upon by the Green Dragoons after they surrendered with sword and bayonet until not one of them was left alive.  The depiction of this character I believe to be one of the strongest points of the film. Jason Isaacs gets deep into the mind of evil. You can see it in his eyes and with every clinch of his jaw.I loved every aspect of The Patriot. The acting was superb, Gibson once again showing brilliance and Leger giving a glimpse of greatness to come.John Williams does it again, providing a score that pulls at every emotion. You will laugh, come to near tears and feel pure hatred as the movie progresses. It is the perfect Fourth of July event, for if this film doesn't tug at your heart as an American you may need to rethink where you live.This is a must see at any cost, but do not be bogged down by the criticism of the historical accuracy of the film. Enjoy it for the great form of entertainment that it is.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Awesome Movie,"A couple of weeks ago my father took our family to see this. We may be Canadian, but as I was watching it I could sense what a surge it would send through the American audiences.My first words will go to the talented actors of this particular movie. Heath Ledger proved that he is worthy of an adult career...even though he is only 21. Mel Gibson performed to the T once more, living up to his pretigious reputation.All of the other actors added flavour and emotion to the movie...from the elderly Cornwalis to Benjamin Martin's youngest, non-verbal daughter.As I left that theatre I knew I was in for some obsession. The movie left you with an imprint of its message, whether or not you liked it.To all these critics, who think that Mel Gibson is predictable: so he is. Yet he'll get your blood pumping faster than any other actor on the face of this earth.",,Anonymous,History
A well acted and beautifully filmed American history lesson.,"The Patriot was beautifully filmed, well acted and historically accurate. Mel Gibson and the supporting cast were truly compatible and really complemented each other. It will be compared to Braveheart, but that  only makes it just as fine a historical presentation. We have had too few films of late depicting American historical events. It will be among the year's best films.",9.0,Anonymous,History
