What a crime thriller should be,"I like it when a movie can keep me guessing until the end, and Gone Girl just did that. Most of the time I didn't know where this film was going, and each new twist and turn was a surprise. You can't help but get pulled into the story. The actors all gave excellent performances, as well. I don't think I'll ever be able to look at some of them the same way again. This movie is what a crime thriller should be.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Mixed feelings, hear me out.","There's no denying that this is a great film and from what I've heard a great book as well, you can see that I gave it a 9/10 rating, but there's a catch especially for me personally with this movie. The shorts version I can tell you and with my hand to God no lie this movie single handedly put the nail in the coffin for my marriage without me even being the wiser. So for as much as I do appreciate the detailed and intriguing story, watching it years later after my divorce it sends chills through my body knowing that my ex wife and I enjoyed this movie together, and obviously me not knowing just how much she loved it but how it inspired her to go about divorcing me in the way that she did, be weary because there are sick people (men and women) in this world that will vindictively assassinate someone else's character and well being just to avenge whatever perversion that they're transfixed on in their own mind. I'm not looking for sympathy or anything, I'm just stating a fact that happened to me, I don't advise watching this for the first time with a love partner, it could unhinge the mind beyond a point of no return, I'm absolutely 100% serious about this, this is not a joke.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"A Cynical, Masterful Caricature of Modern Relationships","Amy and Nick Dunne are young, stylish and charming. The immaculate dream couple? It seems so, at least on the face of it. But infidelity and financial troubles let the glamorous façade crumble. One morning, Amy disappears without a trace, and Nick becomes suspect. Did he kill his wife? The media depict him as an uncaring husband, and he's trying desperately to correct that image. But what if he really is the murderer everyone believes him to be?""Gone Girl"", based on the Gillian Flynn novel of the same name, is a masterful thriller, a sharp-sighted media satire and a cynical analysis of modern marriage. Flynn herself wrote the screenplay for the movie adaptation, and David Fincher turns the already disturbing story into something even darker. ""Gone Girl"" is a perfect fit for Fincher, as it is concerned with two of his favorite themes: gender issues and modern media. The main topic here is how the media are shaping our own identities. Nick Dunne has to adapt to the expectations of the public in order to survive. As his lawyer Tanner Bolt puts it: ""This case is about what people think of you.""Amy and Nick both just play a character. They pretend to be a perfect couple. The movie suggests that pretending and being are not as far apart as we tend to think. When everyone plays along, the shallow masks are going to work. The much-maligned ending underlines this insight perfidiously. It's the point where ""Gone Girl"" becomes a pitch-black social satire. The last act isn't a thriller anymore, it's a grotesque caricature of modern relationships. I've never seen anything like it, and I can't praise Fincher enough for the risk he took with the last half an hour of this movie.Ben Affleck is great as the insipid husband Nick. You love to hate him. Rosamund Pike is simply mind-blowing. You'll also see Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry in unusual roles. My personal favorite is Carrie Coon as Nick's caring yet foul-mouthed sister Margo. She's the heart of this movie, because unlike everyone else, she genuinely speaks her mind. Kim Dickens as the clever detective Rhonda Boney is pretty approachable, too.""Gone Girl"" might be Fincher's most splendid masterpiece yet. This movie is so unsettling and cynical, it feels like it was directed by the love child of Alfred Hitchcock and Lars von Trier. If that's not awesome, I don't know what is.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Interesting end,This is a 2.5 hour movie and sometimes these days it's difficult for me to stick with the longer movies but this never felt long. You were always curious what was going on. Let's just say it didn't quite go the way I expected but I was intrigued the whole time. The acting was great. This could for sure be considered a slow burn and I'm actually currently watching the TV show Sharp Objects by the same author and this is paced much better than that. There's a couple things I didn't particularly thing got solved or like how they went at the end but overall a great movie.,8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Great film but the ending was terrible,"I'm not one for reviews, but I tremendously enjoyed this film but felt empty at the end of it. That ending was shockingly bad, such a let down to a great film. Still worth watching but you will end up cursing the writers, producers and perhaps even the actors for that low quality ending. Even if the story was written to end this way, it could have been communicated far better and with far more realistic excitement. It seems like they just plonked it at the end rather than continue the story. What the hell happened? Did they run out of time or needed to release it by a specific date or did the original scriptwriter run off? The end the film was not of the same quality of the rest of the film and left me feeling shortchanged.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Gone, but definitely not forgotten","Wow, actually a thriller that's pretty good. Yes, it's fair to say that 'Gone Girl' is a really engrossing film. As with almost every film, it's based on a book. And, as with most films based on a book, I haven't read the book, so I haven't got a clue how well the film relates to the source material. But then I don't care. I just enjoyed the ride.'Gone Girl' is one of those films where you don't want to say too much about for fear of giving things away and spoiling it for people who haven't seen it. Ben Affleck plays a (reasonably) decent husband whose well-to-do wife disappears. The media circus that follows then starts to reveal that the truth is far more complicated that it first seems (not to mention the obligatory police investigation). It's fair to say that what follows is a film that twists and turns, so you only really get one chance to watch it and not know what's coming.Many people don't really like Affleck when it comes to acting (even less now he's due to don the Batsuit!), but I think most people will relate to him as he gets pursued and hounded (unfairly? You'll have to wait and see!) by the media. Rosamund Pike plays his (gone!) wife with a flawless American accent. Again, you'll have to see whether she's found alive or dead. The story bounces around back and forth in time, making sure you're just confused enough never to put too much together before the film's ready to reveal what's happening.If I had one complaint it's that the film is a little too long. Perhaps ten to fifteen minutes could have been edited out at around the three quarters mark, just to speed it up. But that's a minor gripe. Basically, if you like your thrillers twisty and turny (and have a couple of hours to spare on a film that you really have to concentrate on) give this one a go.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Crazy!,"This film wasn't as bad as some people say it was. It was actually good. It was a pretty nice psycho thriller. It had me guessing at times and there really weren't any dull moments. This film was well done with just enough suspense to keep me interested. The acting in this film was great as well. Now, I'm not a big fan of Tyler Perry's films but his acting is good. He had a wonderful performance in this film playing Tannor Bolt, Nick Dunne's (Ben Affleck) lawyer. He was really perfect for the part. For me it was kind of weird seeing Neil Patrick Harris playing a serious roll as the crazy ex boy friend of Nick Dunne's (Ben Affleck) wife, Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike). Rosamund Pike and the parts she were in were well done! I mean she pulled that roll off! Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) was allegedly killed by her husband Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck). From the beginning Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) is the suspect and the craziness starts from there.

"All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players !!!!!!","I have always been a huge admirer of David Fincher. He is undoubtedly one of the most consistent and masterful storytellers in modern cinema. I also think when it comes to dark, disturbing thrillers, there is very few who can match the directorial skills of Fincher.Like many of his previous films, Gone Girl is a very long film, but in a true Fincher-esque fashion, it is as engaging as possible without any scope for the viewer to feel bored. The pacing is perfect. The scenes have a dreamy style to it, which brings the dilemma of ""whether this is a true account of things or has this been made up by the narrator.""The theme of the film is the fact that humans at the basic level are all actors and pretenders. Very seldom do we decide to be our real selves. Generally all of us put on a mask to make ourselves look good in front of the general public and also to pretend to be the person that our nearest and dearest want us to be. Gillian Flynn's screenplay based on her own novel is brilliant and it is also a damning indictment of how media can shape and mould mass perception and it is also a cynical account of the institution of marriage.Ben Affleck is good, Tyler Perry is good, but this movie from an acting perspective belongs to Rosamund Pike. She owns every scene that she is in and delivers an Oscar-worthy performance.Fincher has once again has made a fantastic film. The last 30 minutes might not be completely logical, but it is still symbolic. If you are about to get married,stay away from Gone Girl.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Dark And Twisted, Full Of Great Visual Storytelling","Dark and twisted, David Fincher's stylish new mystery thriller was derived from Gillian Flynn's intriguingly slick tale from her complex and suspenseful novel. By far one of the best acting performances to have come from Ben Affleck, 'Gone Girl' boasts some strong yet disturbing portrayals from Rosamund Pike, Neil Patrick Harris, Tyler Perry and Affleck. Fincher has garnered fame and recognition as a mainstream director, that is not only able to engulf the audience within the picture, but actually make them part of the scenario. Fincher exercises upon his trademarks with the swift and stunning cinematography, the chilling score and tight editing, all of which makes 'Gone Girl' a movie full of great visual storytelling.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Another David Fincher winner and one of the year's best,"David Fincher to me is one of the most talented directors around today, and while Se7en from personal opinion is his best film Gone Girl is up there with his best. Fincher directs with his usual superb class, giving the film great style and keeping the story alive(Gone Girl is easily one of the year's best directed films), and the whole film looks absolutely great with brooding lighting that evokes the creepy atmosphere brilliantly and Gone Girl is also a film that makes good use of digital, after seeing many directors over-using or cheapening it it was refreshing to see the technique done with taste. Trent Rezner and Atticus Ross's music score gives the film a haunting vibe and adds much to the unsettling intensity that a lot of the film(at least two-thirds worth), managing to not do it in an in-your-face manner. The use of sound mixing was interesting and came off cleverly, almost like a distant thought process. Gone Girl also has a brilliantly written and adapted script that does a great job balancing dark humour- that's not overused and is often hilarious- and suspense mystery (The Cool Girl monologue in particular is a masterpiece of script-writing, one of my favourite film monologues ever), while the story(apart from taking a bit of time to get starting) is absorbing from start to finish, rich in detail and characterisation and is filled with shocks and unpredictable twists that will be guaranteed to leave you reeling. That it is adapted from superb source material(one of the best books I've read in recent memory actually) helps it, and that it is faithful to it is commendable, a case of being faithful to the source material actually coming off wonders rather than being bogged down by being too faithful. The not-what-they-seem characters are incredibly interesting and richly developed, especially Amy who is one of the most chilling female characters of the year. And the acting is one of the high points of the film, as good as Fincher's direction and the score are it's Rosamund Pike's knockout turn as Amy in restrained- she only has to raise an eyebrow or something like that and it says a lot- but quite terrifying mode(especially in the third act) that makes the film. It will be a great surprise if she isn't at least nominated because it is easily her best performance. Ben Affleck has the other not-what-they-seem role and plays it with oozing charm and brooding intensity, while Neil Patrick Harris surprisingly excels in a very against-type role(who knew he could be sinister?) and Tyler Perry oozes charisma and is very funny. Carrie Coon is the standout in support, it's a tricky role and the moral compass of the film but Coon is touchingly likable in it. The ending does for my liking end too suddenly and the storytelling got implausible and lazy at this point, but apart from that Gone Girl was a winner and one of the best of the year. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Perfect example of a modern day thriller,"David Fincher has done what i thought was the impossible, by making a movie from a book, and it actually being good, i'm even going to say better than the book, and i don't give that out lightly.First off, the use of sound within the film, both diegetic and nondiegetic really sell this film to me, it does a great job in unnerving us as an audience and its just a little off, if i looked at the score of the film, i wouldn't be surprised if it comprised of tritones (For those who don't know, tritones make music sound just that tad off), and the synth sorta sound reminds me a lot of Alex Forrest's signature tune from ""Fatal Attraction (1987), Adrian Lyon""The Story is fantastic it really shows the disconnect between people in the modern day, and how the media influences everything so strongly.In Summary this movie is a great watch, and if you enjoy the genre, or just trying to put together pieces of a metaphorical puzzle you will enjoy this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Unique and darkly funny,"Two movies for the price of one.That's a fairly glib start to a review of a movie that I really liked, but it is true. The first half of Gone Girl is a fairly standard ""did he or didn't he"" mystery thriller. Then, about an hour in, the perspective shifts entirely and suddenly you realise that you're watching – perhaps – the most pitch-black comedy that you've ever seen.Despite the abrupt shift, I still think that Gone Girl holds together extremely well as one whole movie. Ben Affleck's Nick manages to inspire sympathy without ever being truly likable while Rosamund Pike's Amy (the star of the show in my opinion) is brilliant, terrifying, hilarious and despicable in various combinations and occasionally all at the same time.David Fincher's direction is both classy and clever (as usual) and several scenes are particularly outstanding due at least as much to his brilliance as that of the actors involved in them. My one complaint would be over the length – it really didn't need to be two and a quarter hours long. There were certainly a few moments, particularly in the first half, when I wished that the movie would hurry up and get to the point just a little more quickly.Gone Girl is a movie unlike any that I've ever seen before and as such largely defies further description. I would recommend this movie to all (with a warning that the adult rating is well earned) but especially those with a dark sense of humour. The darker the better.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Best performance of an actress for 2014!,"Having read the book, it was not an easy feat who will be able to bring to life the leading character of the book, which is Amy Dunne.

If Fincher was looking to out do himself...he has succeeded.,"Gone Girl marks Fincher's tenth feature film and his most mature work since Fight Club. Centering on Nick Dunne, a husband desperately trying to find his wife all while having police and media accuse him of murder. The story sounds straight out of the Scott Peterson case and the film looks unlike any film I've seen in recent years. Lead by an all star cast featuring Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike, Tyler Perry and Neil Patrick Harris, Gone Girl rises above the pack with smart storytelling, phenomenal pacing and perfect performances. What Gone Girl does so brilliantly is taps into the audience's psyche regarding marriage and the ideology behind a sanctioned union that is corrupt. It is really heavy stuff when the story really gets to the meat and bones of it all. With plenty of twists and turns, Gone Girl keeps you, not only second guessing the whole idea of marriage, but the intentions of every character in the film. It is truly one of the most twisted films adapted from an even sicker and twisted book that's out there right now. Gillian Flynn does wonders with her adaption from her own novel. The dialog is crisp, the characters are multi-layered, it truly is a pitch perfect script that doesn't have one false moment in it. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike are EXCELLENT in this film. This is a different Affleck, a very human and realized Affleck. Nick Dunne is a wonderful role for him and captivates just how good he can be with a terrific director. Harris and Perry give well rounded performances as well but are nothing compared to Affleck and Pike. David Fincher and his long time collaborator and cinematographer, Jeff Cronenweth create a dreary, horrific tone for Gone Girl that makes every twist and turn that much more gut wrenching. Every shot is meticulously planned, showing each shot as if it were a still frame that spoke a thousand words. It is truly gorgeous filmmaking. And now for the score...Trent Reznor and Atticus Finch deliver a perfect score, besting their Social Network and Girl with the Dragon Tattoo score. If Reznor won for Social Network, I fully expect not only a nomination but a win for this film. Overall, this is a mesmerizing film that demands multiple viewings to truly get the full experience. It is impeccably made, beautifully acted and an all around near perfect film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

"""Gone Girl""- A remarkable character-centric mystery/drama that excels courtesy its incredible performers and David Fincher's expert direction.","I would like to start out by addressing something I find totally unfathomable- the sheer volume of criticism the film has attracted here on IMDb. Though, I cannot say I am completely unsurprised by it... after all, this site in particular seems to bring out the worst side of people, and attracts many of the ""Negative Nancy's"" of the internet. Still, it's rather disheartening that so many people are being so dismissive of this film over trivial or even objectively incorrect perceptions of it's ""weaknesses.""""Gone Girl"", directed by modern cinematic mastermind David Fincher, is one of the most stirring, mind-bending and thrilling mystery/dramas in years. Elevated thanks to Fincher's expert guidance and universally incredible performances from it's expansive cast, the film is very much the perfect modern thriller, delivering enough edge-of-your seat twists to keep you enthralled and still pondering the implications of the film long after it's finished...Ben Affleck stars as Nick Dunne, a man whose seemingly ""perfect"" marriage has been crumbling for some time, culminating in the disappearance of his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) the morning of their fifth anniversary. Nick soon finds himself at the center of an enormous cluster of problems, including the growing media circus surrounding the case, uneasiness with local authorities who are trying to find Amy, and his own inconsistent attitude, which is painting him in an increasingly suspicious light. What happened to Amy? Is Nick truly the loving husband he wants to work to believe he is, or is he the sinister sociopath that media wants to paint him as? And, most importantly... did Nick in fact kill his wife?While I cannot give too much away as to avoid spoilers, I must say the casting and performances are incredible, and absolutely spot-on. Affleck knocks it out of the park as a troubled man who may not be the figure he outwardly tries to portray himself as. Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry make for thrilling supporting roles that take you by surprise, especially considering their predominately comedic backgrounds. Kim Dickens gives a great turn as a local officer who is simultaneously one of Nick's biggest assets and also one of his biggest detractors. And Carrie Coon shines as Nick's sister, who serves as his moral support, despite not always telling him everything he wants to hear.But it is Rosamund Pike, the titular ""Gone Girl"", who shines the brightest. This is her film. Everything about her role is intriguing, troubling and keeps the mystery and suspense alive. In particular, her journal entries which comprise the backbone of the film... and also lead the audience to question whether she or her husband had their own ulterior motives in the marriage, and warps the perception of the story. Pike deserves so much more recognition for this role. Because this is the role of a lifetime.Writing duties are handled by Gillian Flynn, whom also wrote the novel upon which the film is based. While I have not read the book (and therefore refuse to compare it), Flynn constructs a tight, concise, yet also deliciously mysterious tale, and some of her framing devices and artistic flourishes help elevate what could have otherwise been quite the routine film. I'm excited to see what comes next for Flynn, because this film has definitely made me want to keep my eye on her work in the future.Director David Fincher continues to prove his status as one of the great directors working today with this film. As he has with previous works, he soaks this film in his deliciously dark, twisted, sometime nihilistic visual and storytelling sensibilities. And it fantastically compliments and augments the uneasiness of the story, and the unsure relationship the audience has with the characters.And finally, there is the remarkable score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. My god, this is one of the most unique and fascinating musical scores I've heard in some time. I've been increasingly interested in the duo's work, especially after their last collaboration with Fincher on the ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" remake (which I will admit, I think has a slightly superior score), and they once again provide the perfect audible backdrop to the visual experience of the film. Bravo, Reznor and Ross.""Gone Girl"" is easily one of the best films of the year, in my opinion. It's a stellar example of modern mystery and tightly- assemble character drama. And it's a film that will haunt you long after it ends.It's a perfect 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"It's clever, funny, something a little different.","I have a huge amount of love for Gone Girl, it helped to re-ignite interest into a genre of films that had really started to die off, the mystery.

Gone Girl,"A drama in the beginning became a thriller by reasoning. The best muse I felt was the setting which provided the inspiration for the switch. The best actor in the movie was Ben Affleck with best face - confused state of mind. The story-line really I felt catered to the well-informed because it changed. It's meant for those that anticipate watching the whole movie not just parts. It requires attention and attention to detail; thought provoking.

Captures Most Of The Book's Bizarre Mystery,"Its a little tough for me to watch/review ""Gone Girl"" seeing as how I had already read the book. For a plot that relies heavily on surprise and misdirection, I already knew what was going to happen, and that obviously makes it a different viewing experience. I was very impressed, however, by how the film was able to capture the basic essence of the Gillian Flynn novel (maybe it helped that Flynn wrote the screenplay herself!).For a basic plot summary, ""Gone Girl"" tells the story of Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) and his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike). One day, Nick comes home and finds his home a crime scene and his wife gone. Lead investigator Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) immediately suspects Nick, whose Ivy League nature and shadowy past make him seem like a viable candidate for the crime. Despite initial support from sister Margo (Carrie Coon) and Amy's parents (played by David Clennon & Lisa Banes), the case against Nick seems to keep getting worse and worse. Could he really have killed his wife?This movie excels in a number of different areas. Flynn is able to seamlessly move the plot from book to screen (no easy task) while still retaining its creepy nature and haunting themes. The casting is also spot-on. Affleck is playing practically the role he was born for (good-looking suave guy who may just be a complete slimeball) and Pike is similarly perfect in her own way. I can see why this one was nominated for a number of Academy Awards.Of course, probably the hallmark of ""Gone Girl"" is that besides spinning a great mystery, it also provides some subtle (or not-so-subtle) commentary on the institution of marriage. I wish I could say more, but to do so would be the ruin the surprises for those who haven't seen it yet. For lovers or young newlyweds watching this movie, I can easily see it producing either deep conversation or very awkward moments.Why not a five-star rating? Well, my exact ranking would be 4.5 stars. I have to go the other direction, however, primarily because I HAVE read the book previously. If there is one thing that doesn't transfer over it is a little bit of the deep commentary on relationships in general. ""Gone Girl"" is a psychological thriller, so some of that is probably better examined in the slower pace of the novel. While reading the book, I was completely sucked in and entranced. Most of that carried over into this film, but not necessarily ALL of it.Of course, I can easily see someone who doesn't know the plot ranking this a five-star effort all the way. It manages to tell an individual mystery filled with over-arching themes about relationships and marriage. A truly haunting tale.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

A Hitchcockian thriller of postmillennial proportions,"""Gone Girl"" has Ben Affleck as a man who becomes the central suspect in his beautiful Ivy League wife's ghastly disappearance from their upscale Missouri home. What happened to Amy Dunne? If you've read Gillian Flynn's book or have seen the film, then you already know the story, but I'll spare the details just for the sake of spoilers.David Fincher has a penchant for making films that are stylistically rich, masterful in many ways, though not always exactly thematically profound. ""Gone Girl"" falls somewhere in-between, heavy on visual slickness with some profoundly interesting ruminations on marriage, celebrity, social status, and the all-seeing spotlight of 21st century media bleeding into our lives at the most inconvenient and horrific of moments. These are obviously transferred from Flynn's novel, but Fincher's treatment of the material is apt and his vision is stunning.The sinister quiet of suburbia echoes throughout the film's open spaces, and an unusually haunting aesthetic is carried with it. The million dollar house tainted only by the smallest speck of blood; a wife who may or may not be in a danger; curbs alight with news vans and paparazzi. The universal hysteria and obsession we have with murder and crime is fully realized here, and the nightmarish situation is brought to life in a way I've never seen on film before. Flashy modernist photography accentuates thematic elements while juxtaposing with the film's more classic narrative roots, and to great effect.Needless to say, the performances here are incredible. Even as someone who is not a Ben Affleck fan, I found his performance to be truly admirable, walking the line between innocent small- town guy to deserved hex object. It wasn't until halfway through the film that I realized just how nuanced Rosamund Pike's performance was— she is so good that I was fooled by her banality, and the role becomes almost metonymic as the film unravels her throughout its narrative. Carrie Coon is wonderful as Affleck's spunky and supportive sister, and Tyler Perry and Neil Patrick Harris somehow work here despite my skepticism of their casting.The film eventually unveils its absurdist thriller roots about midway through, and unfolds in a way that is Hitchcockian in both style and substance, with shades of ""Vertigo"" bleeding into the frames. The film's conclusion is of similar Hitchcockian proportions— unbelievable and yet wholly tangible. No matter how absurd it may seem to be, we do not question it because we really aren't allowed to.Overall, ""Gone Girl"" is a solid thriller through and through, and is one of the best movie-going experiences I've had in recent memory. Like all the greats, its narrative has all the appropriate twists and turns and is consistently engaging, but rather than simply doing that and taking the route of imitation lone, it's very aware of and engages with its sociohistorical locus. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
David Fincher one of the greats,"David Fincher is one of those directors I get excited for as soon as a one of his films gets released. He just knows how to make a bloody good movie.His track record of films is just getting better and better with time.So Gone Girl based on a book by Gillian Flynn is probably the best film I have seen this year so far. It keeps you on the edge of your seat for so long and while it may not have a ground breaking original idea (Nothing really does nowadays), it does it well. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike do great jobs as well as the rest of the cast. Especially Rosamund who really does smash it out of the park, I got the same feeling off her as I did from Rooney Mara from the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Hey look another film Mr Fincher Directed).Its just an intense thriller with themes that go along with it like marriage and relationships and how we portray ourselves for people in our lives and the public.Not much to say really apart from WATCH THIS MOVIE!The only criticism I can find with the film it is quite long and the opening is slow a build up to a great pay off. I feel the book would fill any gaps that other people may find with film and I heard the book has a different ending also so if you do not like the ending maybe read the book for a more satisfying conclusion? The ending for me made sense and maybe open up for a sequel? Meh who knows....Anyone watch this film!Thanks and hope this was useful for anyone who reads this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
David Fincher proves he is a hard hitting Director once again.,"Gone Girl could be the best film so far this year but Viewer discretion is DEFIANTLY advised. The film follows Nick and Amy Dunn a newly wed couple settling into life in Missouri. But it that all changes when Amy goes missing. The entire country jumps on board to try and help find Amy. And slowly everyone starts turning on Nick. The Back nice guy that is pretty oblivious to everything around him. But if you think you have this movie figured out, think again.THE GOOD STUFF! It's directed by David Fincher. One of the most ambitious dark directors of the modern age. And he's done it again. The script is very tightly written. Movies based on books tend to either flop or are critically praised. But when you have the author of the book writing the Screenplay not much can go wrong. The Dark humor that is sprinkled in is perfect for the scenes that its used in and is often hilarious. The film has a mood surrounding it that is unlike any movie you will ever see. Through out you are at the edge of your seat yet also constantly looking behind you as a deeply unsettling feeling creeps over your body. This is in large part thanks to the performances by the leads. Ben Affleck and Rosamund pike are so terrific in there roles as well as just about everyone else.THE BAD STUFF... Well like I said there isn't to much that can go wrong when the books author is on board helping write. There is really only one thing that I didn't like in this film. Near the beginning there was a lot of nudity. Now don't get me wrong i'm OK with it as long as it helps to obtain what the film is going for. Which closer to the end its used perfectly. But the nudity at the beginning feels completely unnecessary and forced. And there wasn't much shortage of it either.The Verdict Gone Girl is without a doubt one of the best films of the year. Featuring outstanding acting, superb writing, and just an overall mood to it that is unlike anything in film. But some of the nudity took me out of the movie because of how forced it felt.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Expect some Oscar nominations for this outstanding piece of cinema!,"Gone Girl starts just as good as it ends with an unforgettable bang!If you're unfamiliar with Gillian Flynn's book Gone Girl, Gone Girl is about Nick Dunne's wife (played by Rosamund Pike) who suddenly disappears one day without a trace and a subsequent search ensues. It's a pretty basic story and premise on the surface but under the surface, the film touches on themes such as marriage, trust, perception and how we view people through the media.Gone Girl is beautifully crafted by the master of deep moody films David Fincher and that essence is present in this almost masterpiece. The cinematography by Jeff Cronenweth is spellbinding and almost revolutionary. You can expect to see praise at the upcoming Oscars for directing and cinematography.The score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross was so pulse pounding and riveting that it gives the movie an entirely new meaning and feeling. Once again expect an Oscar nod for these gentlemen.Finally the magnificent acting. The acting all round was just brilliant with no one lagging behind. However, the best performance of the entire film and possibly the entire year is the magnificent and awe inspiring Rosamund Pike. Her performance just took the film by storm! You can expect some Oscar recognition for her this year.My problems with the film are to do with the script. In some scenes (which are as rare as a good M. Night Shyamalan film), things just fall flat. I also disagree with the ending - I thought it ended a bit too abruptly for my liking.I highly recommend you check Gone Girl out - it's an impressive and unforgettable film that will be recognised at the upcoming Oscars and that will stay with you long after the credits have finished.★★★★ or 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Maybe, maybe not","David Fincher is a phenomenal craftsman. His visual style dominates every inch of the frame but why is it that I left the theater so untouched, so unscathed. I told the story to someone over dinner and I couldn't do it without laughing. This is no comedy, or is it? So, what is it about David Fincher's movies that include some shocking stuff without shocking me. I can observe without participating. Cold, maybe that's it. The passionate story is told without passion but with a feverish attention to the cosmetic veil that covers or masks the real story. I wasn't bored, just impatient and a bit put off. I admired the performances and wondered about the casting of Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry. I suspect is code for something but I can't imagine what. After all said and done, goo see it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Another hit for Fincher,"Gone Girl was one of my most anticipated movies of 2014 and surely, this latest effort in Fincher's career did not disappoint. This gripping drama follows Nick Dunne as a husband who's wife went missing and the case is on to find out what really happened. Based off the novel of the same name, the screenplay written by the book's author, Gillian Flynn, is a well executed script for a big screen drama.Speaking of writing, Gone Girl utilizes the usual cliques you would expect from a typical drama and twists them around in directions one might not see coming. The script for this movie is excellent and well worth the possibility of an Oscar nomination for best adapted screenplay. The dialogue feels very natural and compelling, the structure for the story is solid all-around, and the pacing flows very smoothly despite the lengthy run-time. Overall, the movie has a fantastic script that will keep you engaged throughout the story.The performances for the most part are fairly solid across the board. Even though I'm not a big fan of Ben Affleck as an actor, I do believe that he puts on a great performance as Nick Dunne. Tyler Perry also puts on a surprisingly great performance and I would like to see him be in more dramatic roles outside of Madea. However, the real big standout is Rosamund Pike whose excellent performance as Amy Dunne takes the main spotlight. As for Neil Patrick Harris, well, he isn't bad, but lets just say he's just good and not great like the rest of the cast.The cinematography is also one of the film's strongest assets and David Fincher certainly knows how to set up a shot. They're steady and smooth from scene to scene in order to give you a clear shot of the characters at hand. Most of the editing is properly well-done; although a few transitions during certain scenes could have been executed more smoothly. The score is also great and Trent Reznor, once again, showcases his musical talents with the music choices being used for each scene.Overall, I think Gone Girl is one of David Fincher's best works to date and its one of the better movies to come out in 2014. An excellent script, great performances, and solid visuals makes Gone Girl guaranteed to be worth your time and money. I highly recommend that you go out and see this great movie and I going to give it an 8 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Convincing story and brilliantly cast, a sure-fire shot for Best Picture.","GONE GIRLBased on the critically-acclaimed best selling novel of the same name by Gillian Flynn, here we have a thrilling, engaging picture that will keep you constantly doubting yourself just when you think you've sussed it out.The story, for those that haven't read the book, revolves around the disappearance of Nick's (Ben Affleck's) wife, Amy, with Rosamund Pike playing the titular role. Split into a solid three acts, each one will have you confused - in a good way - more than the last, with you either rooting Team Nick or Team Amy for who you think is in the right - or the wrong.Some powerful narrative is provided by Pike, which only aids in the deep story and gives insight into the characters inner thoughts. At two and a half hours long, it's a lengthy sitter, but being so engrossed in the film as you are you will hardly notice, so an achey bum shouldn't be a worry.Each member of the cast are fantastic in their roles, especially praising Pike who - really stealing the show - convincingly shows us her idea of 'crazy bitch wife'. Brilliant, none the less.Neil Patrick Harris, of How I Met Your Mother fame, also gives a great side performance as ill-fated, creepy stalking ex Desi.This has to be one of, if not, the film of the year. No fantasy, no science fiction, this is something that could happen, which makes it all the more compelling. David Fincher - director of Oscar winners The Social Network, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and nominee Fight Club - adds another picture to his impressive portfolio and with it, a sure Best Picture winner.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
David Fincher is great again.,"Ben Affleck stars in this twisted thriller, based off the best selling novel by Gillian Flynn and boy was it perfectly adapted to the screen. Now Ben Affleck I thought was gonna shine over everyone, but Rosamund Pike's twisted, dark performance improves this film to a near masterpiece mystery. I thought Ben Affleck was just great, but he didn't get the Oscar nom, well there was just way more competition. The David Fincher direction is very noticeable in the film and he has perfectly made another dark mystery, making it more effective with every twist. Rosamund Pike, she very well gives the best performance of the year for a female, also just acting in general. This woman knocks it out of the park and she embodies the twisted, insane darkness of Amy from the book. Tyler Perry was a huge surprise of all and he didn't ruin the film and actually improved it. Neil Patrick Harris was OK, but he just wasn't the right guy for this role. This film was snubbed by the Oscars in the Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Original Score categories.

Unsure why this movie has so many negative reviews....,"Quite honestly, this was one of the best movies I've ever had the privilege of seeing. Not sure why there are so many negative reviews..

In many ways the best film ever,"David Fincher has done it again! And on a whole new level. Gone Girl is a masterpiece which includes everything you would expect from a Fincher film, mainly the overall visual image of the film is classically Fincher (beautiful, stunning & cool).Gone Girl plays with the viewer, from start to finish you don't know what to expect next, there is no moment of relief where you feel safe that nothing significant is going to happen, real edge of your seat stuff. The two main characters (Ben Afleck & Rosamund Pike) steal and throw away your allegiance more times then you can count, the film makes you want to choose a side and sympathise with a specific individual, however it is almost impossible to do so. You will: hate, love, feel sorry for and be surprised by both lead characters many many times throughout. (I would also like to add that Neil Patrick Harris gives an amazing performance, the best acting I've ever seen him do)It is like no other film I've ever seen before, and to top it off I cannot find any aspect of the film that I didn't think was perfect.

The master of complex and implausible.,"If there's someone inside the film industry, which is capable of depicting in a beautiful, dark and cold cinematography, stories filled with plot twists and fairly implausible characters, that is David Fincher. An obsessed retailer that in over 120 minutes can carry out scripts that nobody else could. Gone girl is not the exception.Bringing out the best from Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike teaching us that she will be one of the most sought actresses of the following years and giving dark challenges to Neil Patrick Harris, Tyler Perry and Emily Ratajkowski, Gone Girl gives us one of the most immersive thrillers of the year, and several years back. Being true to his style, Finchi- Noir does it again in theaters, delivering with a dark picture and a haunting sound, one of the most complex and sociopathic marriages the history of cinema has ever seen. In 149 minutes, we have the opportunity to be part of the investigation of a crime with a ton of faces, filled with several decisions to make and with two sides to choose from. You really want to keep watching those turns, that sometimes make sense and sometimes don't, for about 149 more minutes.David Fincher in my opinion.1. Fight Club. 2. Seven. 3. The Social Network. 4. Gone Girl. 5. Zodiac. 6. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. 7. Panic Room. 8. The Game. 9. The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. 10. Alien 3.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Occam's Boxcutter,"The institution of marriage, being a foundation of civilization since the dawn of man, has adapted to subsequent eras but, in some aspects, not necessarily improved. Problems between men and women abound regardless of the type of their relationship, resulting in various commentaries and insights as to possible solutions, either temporary or permanent. Yet, the central question remains: can two people, often complete strangers when initially meeting, remain faithful to one another and build enough trust to establish a meaningful and fulfilling relationship? There have been several notable examples but, as time seems to reveal, knowing more may result in understanding less.At last, we have a cinematic representation of the perilous ups and downs of the journey from courtship to romantic climax to marital pitfalls, all within the context of an increasingly cynical social construct. Certainly, the subject of strained marriages is nothing new to the movies, but David Fincher's adaptation of Gillian Flynn's best-selling novel goes deeper, bleaker and more harrowing than any other film of its kind. Fatal Attraction was a childish affair compared to the Dunnes.As the film opens, with a rapid and nervously jumpy energy, Fincher gives a masterclass on how to establish mood in a thriller. Every scene is impactful, every shot built to further the tension and tighten the air. The conclusion seems fairly certain, and Fincher wants us to want that conventional denouement. After all, wouldn't that be easier and safer to digest than anything else?Yet, Fincher refuses to gratify our simplistic expectations. Flynn, in adapting her own novel, tightens up the pace and slightly alters the ending to create a remarkably paced and exquisitely fashioned narrative, but it is Fincher's trademark cool, detached visual style complete with complex shadows and hints of blue and gray that put the finishing touch on this experience. One simply cannot look away from this film. At the halfway point, the 'reveal' utilized deflates any and all expectations we may have had, only to overwhelm us with endless questions as to how, what and why. The rest of the film covers those inquiries, yet still retains a level of ambiguity and forlornness. We continue to watch because it is in our interest as thriller-fans to do so, but on a subconscious level, there is the knowledge that conventionality is out of the question.Fincher's stylistic, sometimes smug, modus operandi is exemplified through his extraordinary ability to cast perfectly. Long understood as an overtly-handsome, sometimes aloof actor, Ben Affleck carries this film thanks to the control and forced exactness of Fincher's directing. His aloofness, as several critics have noted, is utilized here to the greatest effect, causing the character of Nick Dunne to remain an enigma and a sympathetic man simultaneously. Very few actors could pull this off, but Affleck makes it look easy, using his broad, muscular body structure, puppy-dog eyes and down-turned smile to keep everyone guessing as to his true motive.Motive is more crucial here than in most thrillers. Flynn's story questions the deepest expectations and assumptions we make about other people, particularly those we think we would like to spend a significant portion of our life with. Affleck can reflect this as can Rosamund Pike, whose Siamese eyes, creamy skin and sultry voice give nothing away about herself, keeping our guesses constant throughout. Early scenes between Nick and Amy, showing their attempts to win each other over, can only truly be understood in light of the entire film, an aspect of Flynn's novel Fincher exploits particularly well. If nothing is as it seems, what are we supposed to presume could or will happen?As the authorities track the clues as to the whereabouts of Amy Dunne and Nick's involvement, the notion of the simplest answer being best arises. This is frequently a logical error, yet on a certain level that may be the best method of approach. Applying this train of thought to the director, it has been argued that nearly all of David Fincher's films have been an attempt for him to overcome the frustrating and creatively-retarding experience on his first feature, Alien 3. While remaining a simple critical tool to find thematic relations amongst an otherwise diverse career, this notion is tempting to grasp. If there is any truth to it, it may be that Fincher has finally gotten the quality of clout needed to be able to make exactly what he envisions. He has often said he usually gets about 70% of his vision on screen, the rest being compromised out. Somehow, this film feels uncompromising. It is exceedingly dark, foreboding in its attitude not just towards marriage but humanity in general. Questions will abound, but answers often remain just out of reach.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

David Fincher's latest masterpiece,"David Fincher has delivered once again. His latest masterpiece, Gone Girl, is an uneasy thriller based on the novel of the same name by Gillian Flynn, (who also wrote the screenplay for the film). I won't go over too much of the plot here, but the basic premise is about married couple Nick and Amy Dunne (Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike). One day Amy goes missing and Nick is the prime suspect. But all is not what it appears to be. The less I say the better regarding the events that unfold.The film is very much a character driven piece – the many layers of the characters' personalities being revealed slowly and purposefully, and as the movie goes along you grow more and more curious and intrigued by what has happened and what will happen.There are solid performances from all involved. Ben Affleck in one of his best roles ever, gives a strong and studied performance. Rosamund Pike is absolutely stunning, and deserves an Oscar nomination. The supporting cast including Kim Dickens, Carrie Coon, Tyler Perry and Neil Patrick Harris are all fantastic.The cinematography and editing are perfect, the production design slick. The score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, marking their third collaboration with Fincher, is chilling.David Fincher is one of the most creative and innovative directors of our time, and although Gone Girl is not my favourite Fincher film, he never fails to bring to the screen a unique and stylish cinematic experience.Definitely worth seeing on the big screen, Gone Girl is dark, beautiful, terrifying, tense and at times humorous.

Rated R. For Ridiculous.,"Gone Girl focuses on the bizarre and destructive plans of a sociopathic children's author, plotting to frame her hated, philandering husband for murder by disappearing, and then possibly doing herself in or committing unspeakable crimes on the lam.This film should be commended for the sheer amount of characterization, the realistic (ie: suburban, drab) production values and the sheer amount of story detail and facts included in the story. It really has content, or strives to, over sheer filmic style and none of the, you know, computerized special effects, which are the modern hallmark of Corporate Hollywood.The film is also, however, totally ridiculous. As if someone had strived to synthesize Silence of the Lambs with an old fashioned Hitchcock thriller (Vertigo, anyone?) and the results were unintentionally funny.Not just a crime thriller, but also a marital drama, something of a horror pic and there's an ongoing (ultimately repetitive, and annoying) parallel story about local newsmongers framing events, putting sensationalist spin on the disappearance/unsolved crime and of course all kinds of assumptions about gender roles and marital abuse. About 60 percent of screen-time is dedicated to stock procedural scenes of police and journalist types mulling through clues, interview accounts, photos and literally bags of trash to get details on missing kids author Amy Dunne.This film is TRASHY - every other scene is packed with sex, foul language and gratuitous crime drama details, somehow the whole affair seems palatable due to the mature, nuanced dialogue and the ever present 'realism' via hand held shots, underexposed color and suburban drabness.As I mentioned, the film is dedicated to a realist aesthetic, but ultimately, the movie just doesn't know how to end itself - I won't spoil any details, but clearly Fincher and co. thought Gone Girl's antagonist was just too interesting for justice, which is what the audience actually wants.Basically I don't recommend this film as essential viewing. It goes for two and half hours, and after sitting through extensive plot twists and character reveals concludes in an incomprehensible ending, leaving you wondering how you ever bought into the films absurd premise and muddy plot motivations. Gone Girl is a character driven movie with an ending that sucks.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Cyphers and story holes...,"""Gone Girl"" is so smoothly-filmed and staged and acted, a less-seasoned moviegoer is apt to come away from the picture with nothing but admiration and praise. An upscale married couple in New York City hits a financial bump and ends up living with the husband's family in Missouri (in an equally beautiful home, by the way). After a few years, with the relatives now deceased, the couple's marriage unravels and, before long, the wife turns up missing (their glass table is shattered and police find a mopped-up bloodbath in the kitchen). Adapting her own novel, screenwriter Gillian Flynn sets up an intriguing first-half, with the benumbed (and unfaithful) husband at first courted and then reviled by the ever-present media. But the second and third acts of the film are where it runs into trouble, ignoring story holes and stumbling over plot-points. The final scenes, which are dragged out interminably by director David Fincher, are so static and unconvincing as to be ridiculous, mitigating his fine work in presenting this lurid tale (the picture ends up being all about presentation and little else). The central couple (Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike) are thoroughly unlikable, detestable people, while most of the supporting characters (with the exception of a likably dry police detective played by Kim Dickens) are equally appalling. There is really nothing in ""Gone Girl"" to engage our interest except for Fincher's jagged, nasty way in telling a juicy story--but here, the juice leaks out early. ** from ****",4.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

"Deeply Disturbing, Beautiful Masterpiece of a Thriller!","(DISCLAIMER - This review contains potential spoilers. However, if you've read the book or watched the movie, read on!)David Fincher's GONE GIRL is nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece!The acting is superb. Ben Affleck plays Nick Dunne, the likable asshole so well, to the point where it made me uncomfortable to like him. His actions and reactions in the film are ingeniously timed, wonderfully realized, and real in every way. Rosamund Pike, however, is the true standout. She absolutely steals the show as Amy Dunne, the psychotic wife. Her portrayal of the sociopath is so cool, calm, and collected - it comes off as much more realistic when she does break down and go ballistic. Even when you know her motives, she keeps you guessing the WHOLE time. Desi Collings is creepily and wonderfully brought to life by Neil Patrick Harris. Carrie Coon is awesome as Margo Dunne, the unglued sister of Nick who has a front row seat to all the action. Tyler Perry is another hilarious standout performance as Tanner Bolt, defensive attorney for Nick. Also worth mentioning is a star performance by Kim Dickens as Detective Boney.The movie is beautifully rendered on screen. The lighting, color palette, and cinematography are all wonderfully beautiful.The screenplay, written by the author of the book upon which this movie is based, sizzles with wit, snappy dialogue, and narration that feels real and conversational.The music is so perfect for the situations it's put in. One of the best uses is towards the end, when Amy seduces Desi into sex and then kills him. The music pulsates and pounds, and the whole time they have sex, you are totally on edge. However, when the deed is done, and she kills Desi and completes sex with him as he bleeds to death, the music crescendos and the terror is fresh. Even though you knew something was not right, the music prepared you for it and elevated the scene.There is literally nothing they could have done better for this movie. It's dark and twisted, macabre and humorous, sexy and violent - everything a modern thriller should be.10/10 - Would Highly Recommend",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Incredible,"Gone Girl was a movie I waited on watching for several years due to the extreme nature of the whole film. From the opening shot, I couldn't take my attention off the screen. It is directed with a level of professionalism and passion behind every movement, sound, word, and frame. It's an extremely unpredictable and effective thriller which had me feeling incredibly uneasy and off balance, which was a clear sign of perfect filmmaking. The cinematography was gorgeous and every shot was either stunning in terms of framing, or mind blowing in terms of the amount of work put into the particular shot. The performances were amazing, and I was consistently taken by surprise by the depth and complexity behind the tone and portrayal of every character. Gone Girl had an incredibly well written screenplay for such a rich, authentic, and captivating thriller. This movie was presented with an artistic way of going about developing characters, framing certain shots, and building extreme tension and unease. David Fincher's direction along with the immaculate screenplay and rich performances made this one of the best movies I've ever seen. Although this movie is phenomenal and very well done, it's a disturbing, graphic, and violent thriller which is not much of a surprise when you consider the past work of David Fincher. In the end, it's simply one of the best movies I've ever seen because of how it is perfectly directed, superbly acted, very well written, and extremely effective.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Mind Blowing Enigma,"Gone Girl begins posing itself as a basic crime drama taking place in a seemingly grounded world that deals with real life situations. The movie does have the promise throughout its smaller first act before all the answers were revealed, but once it shifts to its next move, the story becomes undeniably ridiculous. People, at first, might find it pretty exasperating as it flies away its realistic sense, but once you notice some sophistication towards its mind-bending twists, you can somehow forget bragging about its absurdity and just stay on how the ride would ever turn out. That is how these types of movies work anyway, though Gone Girl constructed it with genuine surprises thus results as a preposterous, yet a thought-provoking thriller.Put the ""unbelievable"" complains to the side, you can see the commentaries all over the place. It is not generally about the investigation for the missing wife, it's more of an exploration to the marriage of the couple, observing that sometimes even at the most intimate relationships could not see the true colors of an individual. Much of the characters may have push the limits of their humanity, but it does help giving effect at bringing fear to their actions and behavior. While that point is palpably terrifying, the amusing side of this mystery is where the social satire sparks. The publicity's involvement to the case is obviously poking fun at the ones who only intervenes to seek public attention; the media often exposing, even distorting real life tragedy for the sake of entertainment, while the straight up people out there are still scratching their heads. The film just extends every darkness the story would show.The story does have its silliness, but David Fincher never lets the central case feel like a joke. There is some strange humor to found in some areas, but most of the time, the direction convinces you that wherever this mystery is going, it is something real serious and possibly twisted that people would still keep thinking about it at the post viewing. The score of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross also helps living up to its uneasy tone. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike are both pretty good in their roles.Affleck may not be everyone's favorite actor, but here he makes the audience really root for his character, while Pike clearly gives herself a spellbinding turn. The rest of the cast remains quite entertaining.Gone Girl comes from simplicity to pure insanity, and that usually troubles to crime/mystery films, but this is one of those exceptions. It doesn't bother negating its enigmatic turns, instead it brings depth to it. Other than the fact that it has thematic connections to social naivety and mass media, the benefit mostly goes to its direction which manifests a colder atmosphere and an interesting rhythm that makes the audience tag along throughout, even when the story takes things too far. That is basically describing the usual style of David Fincher, and that is also the same way of saying the director's achievement triumphs yet again.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A Haunting Look At Marriage and Media Culture,"It's a scary world out there. We see it through three-second snippets of a serene neighborhood in Missouri as each credit quickly fades with every shot. Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) calmly exits his house and takes a trip to the bar he co-owns. After a dispirited talk with his twin sister, Margo (Carrie Coon), revealing how frankly exhausted he is from his wife's personality, Nick returns home to find his wife missing and the glass coffee table shattered. In between the present scenes when we see Nick publicly transform from a sympathized husband in the media to an abhorred one—suspected of cold murder—the story introduces us to Amy (Rosamund Pike).Pike's Amy Dunne immediately has our support and understanding—a wife of unimaginable, elegant beauty. She's intelligent and classy, carrying a fond taste for the sophisticated—the arts. What makes her even more mesmerizing is the fact that these types of rich female characters are a saddening rarity. Oftentimes, actresses are reserved for the tired role of a ditsy romantic interest that has absolutely no self-purpose or motivation. Right from the start, Amy makes us fall in love with her; the amount of dignity, (admittedly) inner arrogance, and wit she possesses is particularly refreshing. She narrates her sentiments through a daily diary, tracing her marriage's evolution from the ""lovey-dovey"" stage to the inevitable phase of irritation five years later.Suddenly, the marriage has taken a turn for the worst. Goosebumps start to form on my arms as I clutch the jacket on my lap harder. Nick begins to display a frightening temper as Amy becomes concerned with their future (and eventually her life) in this loveless and fading marriage that has taken form. Everything about her—her delicate skin, the heartbreaking look in her eyes, her perpetual state of fear—reveals Amy's true vulnerability, which makes me that much more concerned for her as well. What have you done, Nick? The media circus is outside his house every day of the week—incessantly flashing cameras and begging for interviews. The hot media frenzy has found a new victim in this tragic couple. A haunting score in its creepy mellowness— occasional rhythmically blood-pumping with the resounding bass, and sometimes purely heartrending—from frequent David Fincher collaborators, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, adds that final stamp to Fincher's staple atmosphere-setting.Affleck gives a surprisingly impressive performance (as well as unsurprising since Fincher always gets the absolute best out of his actors whether or not the audience is skeptical about them going in— Jesse Eisenberg and Rooney Mara are perfect examples). He has a manner of innocence and ostensible normality about him (unlike the typical characteristics of a psychopath, he's not meticulous or perfectly composed) but yet keeps us doubting as he continually makes the wrong decisions.Moreover, the way this film is edited amazes me—it enthralls you and somehow creates a slow-burn of a thriller with terrific pacing. The juxtaposition between the characters' current activities as a sequence anxiously unravels is astonishing and consequently creates sheer suspense and many gasps from the audience. The two-and-a-half-hour runtime is essential in regards to the exceptional character development/characterization, which ceaselessly continues to contradict our impressions of and sympathies for its characters.Not only does Fincher's latest masterpiece paint a bleak portrait of marriage—the constant denial of your relationship's issues, the expectations of standard marriage and the notion of living up to that— but also showcases the disheartening, malign, and corrupt nature of our media culture. Every individual can live or die based on public perception—one's portrayal on the usually sensationalized, exaggerated outlet that composes the news stations and interview sessions. Unfortunately, society impatiently jumps to conclusions, logically flawed/irrational as they are, expecting the black-and-white dramatics of a fictional narrative.Gone Girl is unrelentingly complex when it comes down to its meaty characters, topical dark subject matter, and overall plot. Its utter brilliance is also proved by the fact that it will undoubtedly stir lengthy conversations. Following the unforgettably terrifying and audacious climax—especially the very final shot—I stay in my seat, not moving an inch, as the credits roll. The packed theater is also unusually still and silent for those brief seconds. There have been few times when I was this eager to have a full spoiler discussion—when I had this much of a craving to go in for a second viewing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Loved loved loved every bit of it!,"This is just an example of awesome filmmaking! Everything worked for this movie! The acting was impeccable, every actor did their job beautifully, and each character was so complex in the film. Everyone had two sides to them, or at Least you come to find out. Rosamund Pike was amazing as our lead actor, very well deserved Oscar nomination and Golden Globe nomination. And let's not forget Ben Affleck our other star. He did a great job of playing the somewhat disturbed and confused husband. This mystery thriller had soo many twists and turns throughout the whole thing! That is what I love, surprises!! I was very shocked to see tyler perry involved in this, but he did very well with his material, and so did Neil Patrick Harris! Warning: if you get unsettled at rough violence or sex, this probably is not the one for you, the whole story is very eery and somewhat dark. Oh, and the ending is mind bending!!

"Detective hat and cape on, Holmes.","Gone Girl [2014] is a drama/mystery/thriller (directed by David Fincher) which follows Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) as the disappearance of his wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike) creates massive national media coverage to decipher whether he's guilty or innocent.No spoilers. The movie trailer gives nothing away. So rest assured the mystery stays intact as you press play. As the story unfolds and more details are revealed concerning their tumultuous relationship, the more you'll switch from one side to the other. It's in the subtleties at first, then the big reveals. We are first the news audience, knowing only what is shown on the surface. Fincher slowly feeds us behind the scenes knowledge and creates an uncomfortably close for comfort intimacy with the characters.Great casting. Rosamund Pike gives a highly captivating and haunting performance as the missing wife, Amy Dunne. A performance so solid it has earned her a Golden Globe nomination. Let's hope she wins it, because it would be richly deserved. Tyler Perry (yes, that very one) appears in a minor but visibly valuable role, as Tanner Bolt (Nick Dunne's attorney). Perry provides the comedy relief in what is a tense and disturbing film. Neil Patrick Harris plays Desi Collings, an old boyfriend of Amy, whom is painstakingly pivotal to the morbid goings-on in Gone Girl. Side note: Desi lives in divinely beautiful house.Impressive original score. Now to tie in the acting, story, directing, is the wonderfully composed score by Atticus Ross and NIN band member Trent Reznor. It is the perfect accompaniment to the morbidly mysterious tale.It's a heavy watch. No doubt a thick and foreboding cloud of deep thought will linger above your head after the film ends. It stays with you awhile. A shocking, intriguing, morbidly engrossing ride for the whole one hundred and forty nine minutes.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Definitely NOT the worst movie ever...not the best either..but glad I gave it a chance.,"I understand why people didn't like this movie. There were lots of mistakes. Lots of unanswered questions. A tidied up episode of CSI it's not. But is that the reason we watch movies? For me a good movie is about keeping me captivated, entertained, and I need to feel something for the characters. This movie did that and more. Ben Affleck and Carrie Coon were very convincing as a loving brother and sister. Rosamund Pike's performance as a psychotic killer rivaled Glenn Close's performance in Fatal Attraction. While I would probably not hire Tyler Perry's character to defend me for murder, his performance was a breath of fresh air. And then there is Kim Dickens. She was soooo good as the lead detective on the case, she should have been nominated for an Oscar. I felt for these characters, they captivated me,and I genuinely wanted to know what was going to happen next. And that makes for a good flick in my book.I was disappointed however in how the movie ended. And to elaborate on my earlier comment, there were plenty of plot issues, loose ends, and things that didn't add up. For that it doesn't get a perfect 10. Not even that close to a perfect 10.

Gone Girl - Review,"Gone Girl is a very dark mystery film. It has all of the elements of a who done it story. However, this film has a twist. The film has a big twist; when the twist happens the film switches gears. The film is about two and a half hours long, but that doesn't matter. When I watch the film, I feel like time fly's, and I'm left wanting more... that's a good thing. The film is extremely fast paced so you're going to have to keep up. I truly believe that this film deserves at least three viewings for someone to really enjoy it. If you watch this movie again and again, then you'll pick up on things that you didn't know were there. The score to this amazing film is eerie and also haunting. I feel like the music really blends in well with the story and scenes being played out on screen. The performances in this film are a mixed bag. I feel like Ben Affleck does his job, but he doesn't give a Oscar worthy performance. I Also feel that all of the other actors in the film only did their jobs. However, Rosamund Pike knocks it out of the park. I'm glad Rosamund is nominated for a Academy Award. In my personal opinion, Rosamund Pike out acts everyone in this movie. This is Rosamund Pike's movie. Rosamund is a rising star. I hope she continues to get roles as juicy as her role in Gone Girl. The film is full of twist and turns and I don't think you're ever going to guess what happens next. This isn't your typical who done it movie. This isn't your typical mystery thriller. In my personal opinion... this is director David Fincher's best work since Seven. If you really want to be entertained, if you really want to be on the edge of your seat, and if you really want to watch a film that will shock you, then I highly recommend Gone Girl for anyone who likes to be surprised.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Woman playing the system,"This movie could be a blueprint for women to treat men badly or it could be an indicator that women, not all, but certainly some, have gone really bad and they can game a system that supposedly is only fair and designed to protect the woman.Any movie that contains a man abusing a woman will get a discussion about what we should do about this situation, and it's often generalised to all men. A movie containing an abusive woman will never get any real discussion. In fact, it will be excused by the man accepting the situation.This movie is treated by most as a thriller in which we find out what happened to the woman. I understand in that sense this movie works exactly like that. The cast are good and acting is good, and it moves along at a fair pace with plenty of surprises. It's worthwhile seeing. It just begs the question that most will never ask, would this happen if a man disappeared?",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

An Average Movie,"I'm surprised at the viewer reviews of this movie. Every review I've seen for pages has been either a rating of 1 or a rating of 10 and I'm amazed that what I considered a pretty mundane film is evoking such impassioned opinions. The storyline of a wife framing her husband for her murder is a tale that has been told many times before (and often told much better, imo). The plot was far-fetched with plenty of holes, as many reviewers have pointed out however, although I wasn't ""on the edge of my seat"", I was reasonably entertained. The antagonist was definitely despicable and I was rooting for Ben Affleck's flawed, yet good, guy and his twin sister. All-in-all, I would sum it up as unremarkable - worth watching on video on a rainy night when you just want to enjoy it for what it is without thinking too hard. If this movie deserves a rating of 1 out of 10 (or for that matter 10 out of 10) what do we have left for the truly awful (or truly masterful) movies?",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
An unfamiliar suspense thriller!,"The argument over the best suspense thriller director in recent times ends with David Fincher. After successfully directing The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo, Fincher presents another unpredictable thriller, Gone Girl (also adapted from a book with the same name). Gone Girl starts with a cozy pace gradually getting the audience interested with a story based on disappearance of Amy (inspiration to Amazing Amy series). Amy's husband falls into the suspect list as their bad marriage relationship emerges. As the movie progress the captivated audience is made to believe in something absolutely defying added with an even more dubious ending. Fincher intermixes tense relationship with violence to create a spectacular mystery. The show stealer performance by Rosamund Pike is notable and justifies her character beautifully. It feels so good that Fincher never disappoints with his work!",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
**A Twisted Tale of Deception and Duality**,"One thing I could say after watching 'Gone Girl' is I am becoming a David Fincher fan and looking forward to watching his other movies too.Gone Girl, directed by David Fincher and based on the bestselling novel by Gillian Flynn, is a masterful psychological thriller that keeps audiences on the edge of their seats. The film explores themes of marriage, media manipulation, and the masks we wear in our relationships, crafting a narrative that is as engaging as it is unsettling.From the outset, we are introduced to Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck), who becomes the prime suspect in the mysterious disappearance of his wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike). The film intricately weaves timelines, juxtaposing Nick's present-day turmoil with a series of flashbacks that reveal the couple's once-idealized relationship. As the story unfolds, we witness not only Nick's struggle to prove his innocence but also Amy's shocking and calculated manipulation of the narrative surrounding her disappearance.Ben Affleck delivers a nuanced performance as Nick, capturing the weariness and frustration of a man caught in a nightmarish situation. However, it is Rosamund Pike who steals the show, portraying Amy with a chilling blend of charm and menace. Her transformation throughout the film is both disturbing and compelling, earning her several accolades, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress.Fincher's direction is meticulous, with a sharp focus on the film's dark themes and a visually striking style that elevates the tension. The moody cinematography and haunting score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross contribute to an atmosphere of unease that permeates the entire film.Gone Girl's commentary on media sensationalism and public perception adds a layer of complexity, prompting viewers to question how narratives can be constructed and manipulated. The screenplay, co-written by Flynn herself, is sharp and sardonic, filled with clever twists and biting social commentary.Overall, Gone Girl is a gripping exploration of marriage, trust, and the darker sides of human nature. It challenges viewers to consider what lies beneath the surface of appearances and the lengths to which people will go to protect their secrets. With its compelling performances and intricate storytelling, it remains a standout in the psychological thriller genre.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

A very intriguing plot with superb acting and editing.,"Even by watching the trailer you get a sense of suspense and this can be felt throughout the whole film. It was brilliantly made and edited. One thing I did not like though, was the numerous black screens. Probably it added to the atmosphere of the film but the cut-offs really bothered me. Also from the trailer, you get a sense of intrigue and want to find out more. Let me warn you, the reviews might tell you that this is not a normal film, but it will far exceed your expectations. This was crazy.I'm not even sure if I liked it all that much, and might be a bit mind-blown at the moment, but I do have to admit regardless that this film was incredible. The way it managed to manipulate the audience's views and feelings at times was exquisite. Not many films are able to do that. Plus it's such a (I was going to say psychotic which wasn't what I was going for, but somehow fits the film) psychological film. I've always wanted to watch more of those, for example Inception, Now You See Me, which are both favourites of mine. But this was almost too psychological. Too much so that after the film everyone in the cinema was silent. Take it as a good or bad sign but it certainly was an accomplishment.The acting as well was superb. Ben Affleck played his part really well making the audience wonder if he really did kill his wife or believe that he did not. But the real master in this was Rosamund Pike. It's really surprising how the trailer shows almost nothing of the movie, but that's a good thing. Anyway, Pike was beyond brilliant and I certainly will view her differently now. I would spoil it if I revealed more. Neil Patrick Harris was pretty creepy in this too though I don't know why. His character doesn't seem like such a bad person.One thing that I do have to say, is that they have a bit too much sex scenes going on. OK, I know I'm not a fan of R-rated stuff (violence, swearing, sexual scenes) but there was too much in this, and I'm not even sure if some were necessary. I admit one or two of them is crucial in telling the story and making more of an impact but do we really need so many?In conclusion, whenever I think of this film both my hands go up to the sides of my head and extend forward with my fingers spread in a gesture that implies being mind-blown.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Gone Girl,"Directed by David Fincher (Fight Club, The social network,), Gone Girl is an adaptation from a novel written by Gillian Flinch. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Rike (Nick and Amy Dunne) are the leading roles and they give an outstanding performance that really helps taking the film to the next level.Gone Girl is a gripping thriller that constantly surprises you by its fantastic plot. It is the story of Nick and Amy Dunne, they form the perfect couple but on their fifth anniversary Amy goes missing. Nick, disoriented, finds himself caught in the middle of a mediatic storm and a police investigation. Slowly we understand that this couple is nothing like what it seems to be. The plots gets darker and darker as David Flinch makes the autopsy of his characters. The film changes tone as we go through the appearances and discover the truth about what really happened. The media play an important role in the movie, Nick is constantly followed by horde of journalist. They talk about his story on the television and the journalists don't hesitate to judge and to take sides in order to attract audience. David Flincher clearly denounces the lack of moral judgment of the press. (Witty,) the story makes a dark critic of the American society in general, denouncing the importance people give to appearances.In my opinion, this film is a very good thriller with a unique style, griping and dark but not too heavy. David Flincher really keeps us on tenterhooks, with an exceptional plot that can't seem to stop thickening. His two main characters are fascinating and he describes them in a way that make them hard to forget. Sometimes the film can get a bit excessive but I would still strongly recommend you to go and see it for yourself!",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

You never disappoint me Fincher,"So Gone Girl is directed by the amazing David Fincher and essentially centers on a man named Nick (Ben Affleck) who comes home to see that a table in his living room is destroyed and his wife has gone missing. Honestly if I said anything else besides that I might spoil something because this movie had an amazing marketing team. I went into this movie expecting it to be sort of a who-done-it type of movie but what I got was so much grander. This movie is utterly messed up and I loved every second of it.We've got a lot to talk about so lets get going. First off, the acting in this movie is great. All around great. Rosamund Pike gives what should be an Oscar nominated performance. A lot of the movie is told through flashbacks of things she wrote in her journal and it's so engaging and I just wanted to figure out everything I could about her and the people she surrounded herself with. One crazy thing, at least to me, was that whenever Ben Affleck was on screen I never saw him as Ben Affleck, I really did see this character he was playing. He wasn't this strapping, good looking guy. He honestly looked like he gained weight for the role to look like the average suburban guy. I just couldn't see an actor the whole time and that is worth commending. One of the huge surprises was Tyler Perry, dude where has this Tyler Perry been all these years?? I want more of this because he was great! Same with Neil Patrick Harris, he's a great actor and deserves good roles.David Fincher's direction in this movie is on point. Every second of this movie looks amazing on a technical level. Each shot has this depressing filter on it that compliments the tone of the movie perfectly. David Fincher always knows how to make his movies look exactly right but he also always makes sure that every shot is the perfect one to use and I can see it done for this movie. Something I love about this movie is it's portrayal of the media when it comes to cases like these and how they constantly try to get the public to agree with everything they say even if what they're saying is completely wrong. To be honest this movie had me believing the media in it for a good majority of the run time until things began to add up about half way through the movie. But I won't dive into that because I'm keeping this review spoiler free.Another thing I love about this movie is it's ability to keep me guessing. Is this character going to do this and is this character going to kill this character? For the full 2 1/2 hours I never lost interest and for a movie to be that long, along with the fact that 99% of the movie is just talking, and still keep me totally invested is pretty great. It also helps that the movie was so great to look at.I could gush over this movie all day and night. David Fincher has crafted another amazing film and I can't wait to get this movie on Blu- Ray in a few months.I give Gone Girl a solid 10/10 and recommend anyone who is a fan of David Fincher's other films to go see this as soon as you can.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Gone Girl one of the Best Film!,"Great things were expected of Gone Girl seeing as it is directed by one of the finest modern auteurs David Fincher and he delivers. This is a compelling thriller based on the novel of the same name by Gillian Flynn. Gone Girl- the book was ripe for Fincher to adapt and it is easy to see why- the book is filled with unreliable narrative, red herrings and twists. Acting is amazing from the ever-reliable Ben Affleck but it is Rosamund Pike as the missing wife who steals the show.

Awful,"So implausible. There is really nowhere to begin. The acting was adequate but the plot was so full of holes it was just sad. This movie averaged 8.2 on IMDb based on the input of over 300,000 viewers. Very troubling. I guess the biggest problem I had was once her plan became obvious to nick and, (correct me if I'm wrong but did she not leave a note with the Punch and Judy dolls admitting to the whole thing ????) nick doesn't go right to the police and say here I solved the case for you the whole thing from then on was ruined. OK even if there wasn't a note confessing to all the crimes and ending the mystery and the movie, still, when they found all that stuff in (HIS SISTERS SHED!!!) why would they not go to the police then, no normal human being let alone two would think that the police wouldn't find it or try to hide it for a minute.

So bad.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Captivating to its core,"After seeing this movie I became speechless. The only word that came to my mind was ""WOW"" but I don't think even that justifies how amazing this movie was. Gone Girl is hands down one of the best thrillers I've ever come across.David Fincher, known for his previous films like Fight Club, Seven and The Social Network, has masterfully directed this movie. He brings out tension throughout this film like no other filmmaker. The cinematography is top-notch and the screenplay by Gillian Flynn, who also wrote the book, is extremely engrossing. Flynn adds a ton of development to the characters accompanied with many twists and turns which allowed the film to be riveting as well as unpredictable. On a technical level, Gone Girl is perfect.The acting was superb. Ben Affleck is terrific as the husband. He portrays a great amount of emotion whilst being under media scrutiny in the film. An actor who I was skeptical about, who is in the film, is Tyler Perry due to his filmography consisting of the poorly received Madea films but to my surprise he shouldered his role well. However, the best part of the film is Rosamund Pike who gives the best perfomance of her entire career. Not only is her character so interesting but her portrayal of that character is Oscarworthy. Her dialogue delivery and body language is perfect. I can't envision any other actress playing this role after seeing Pike's performance.Gone Girl also has a lot of social commentary on the media and the way we perceive them. It's incredible how one headline can change a person's view on someone or how one small detail can be manipulated to make someone look bad. This message, alongside the main story, were done in such a realistic manner that we, as an audience, can relate to and believe what the characters are going through.All in all, Gone Girl is outstanding. The nail-biting script, Fincher's harrowing direction and the amazing performances by everyone make this film really intense, dark and disturbing. If you're a fan of thrillers or enjoy films as a whole, definitely seek this film out.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Something Wicked This Way Comes,"Every once in a while Director David Fincher resurrects and creates an instant classic that's quite hard to pass by. This year, he reawakens to adapt a bestselling thriller that made it in the charts in 2012 and delivers a film that drives home a point.Based on Gillian Flynn's thriller novel, GONE GIRL (2014) unearths the secrets at the heart of a modern marriage. On the occasion of his fifth wedding anniversary, Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) reports that his beautiful wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike), has gone missing. Under pressure from the police and a growing media frenzy, Nick's portrait of a blissful union begins to crumble. Soon his lies, deceits and strange behavior have everyone asking the same dark question: Did Nick Dunne kill his wife?The circumstances were convenient, absurd, and arguably stupid, that at some point you scratch your head and think differently. But knowing that Fincher is behind all these, we faithfully submit to such irrationality and let ourselves get swayed, believing that we are in good hands. With a perfect cast and intelligent direction, GONE explores the duality in all of us and wonderfully presents the argument: that even in the most absurd of things, our willing suspension of disbelief is slowly killing our most prized common sense. That in our generation of uncensored social media, sensationalized programming, down to the smallest of gossips, we all embrace and fight for a truth as fabricated by just one.It is a film worth seeing. With a villain, soooo evil, I doubt if you'd be able to sleep at night without thinking how we can be so cruel.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Intense, smart and intriguing.","Fincher scores again with this amazing piece of art.We follow Nick Dunne on his journey to discover what(or who) is behind his wife disappearance. A quick and intense pace keeps the audience guessing what's to come, and how, through the entire movie. The plot points keeps the audience at the edge of the seat on the expectation of the dissolving of the case.Fearless acting, smart pace, astonishing visuals and a intriguing theme. A lot of people are going to watch this masterpiece, and you reader is probably one of them... So prepare yourself, cause it's a hell of a ride.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
OMG Are You Kidding Me !,"I'm a fan of David Fincher, movies like Se7en (1995), ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008), The Social Network (2010) are top- notch but I'm a big big fan of ""Fight Club"" and no movie of his has been this good but I think Gone Girl came pretty close though both movies are just little different but the twist is mind blower.Gone Girl focuses on the dark side of domesticity that how a family can be this disturbed, I'll try no to spill any spoilers but I'll tell you that the spoiler is revealed at the middle but the amazing thing is that it still hooks you to watch the rest and the ending I think can't be that good. Ben Affleck as Nick Dunne was amazing but OMG Rosamund Pike as Amy Dunne a.k.a GONE GIRL was brilliant, excellent and marvelous, I will only say this that she has the every right to win the Academy.Since this is an adaption to Gillian Flynn's book which she also writes the screenplay which I think was very clever from Fincher to choose Gillian for this job and she excellently done it, the movie is very much to the book and everything goes as I hoped. If you are choosing the movie to watch first its okay but read the book also its brilliant.This is a mystery thriller movie and all the fans of this genre must watch this.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"A cynical, 21st Century look at love and marriage","David Fincher is one of my favorite directors, and for good reason. He's able to take ordinary or middling source material and spin gold out of it. Such is the case with his latest film, GONE GIRL. GONE GIRL is the story of Nick and Amy Dunne, a seemingly happy married couple who live in a Missouri suburb. However, Nick's life turns into a living hell on the morning of their fifth anniversary when he comes home to find his wife missing, and eventually a suspect in her disappearance. In case there are people who haven't seen the film (or read the book), I'll stop here to avoid going into spoiler territory. The film, for me, is a success in every category. David Fincher has yet again created a visually rich and technically superb film that is beautifully shot. The performances were also incredible, from a perfectly cast Ben Affleck as Nick to Rosamund Pike as his wife, Amazing Amy. In fact, Rosamund Pike is a revelation in this film and, in my opinion, gives the second best female performance of 2014 (first place going to Essie Davis for THE BABADOOK). She does an excellent job at portraying a manipulative, conniving woman and Ben Affleck was perfect as her affable husband. It should go without saying that this film does not paint a pretty picture of marriage, and in fact is downright cynical towards it. In a more general sense, it takes a look at the facades we put up for others and the degree to which we attempt to influence other peoples' perception of ourselves. How much is truthful, and how much is a lie? To a lesser degree, the film also examines the way in which popular media affects public perception. This is portrayed in the film by a Nancy Grace stand-in, Ellen Abbott (Missi Pyle). And, believe it or not, Tyler Perry is great as Tanner Bolt, the lawyer that Nick hires to prepare his case, and also helps him do some image rehabilitation. Overall, I loved the film's acerbic wit and satirical edge, not to mention that the story takes a number of twists and turns that you won't see coming. This is one of my favorite films from last year, and I highly recommend seeing it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
David Fincher crafts a meticulous picture with a bravura performance from Rosamund Pike...,"Calculated, meticulous, and completely engaging, David Fincher tackles one of his freshest and stylish films of his career with the adaptation of Gillian Flynn's novel ""Gone Girl."" Intelligently structured by novelist Flynn herself, the film features a mannered turn by Academy Award winner Ben Affleck while the absolute success of the picture is indebted to the lavish and grandiose performance of Rosamund Pike.If you are unaware with the story, stay clear of any plot spoilers as possible. Obviously I always respect such a demand. Simply put, the film tells the story of Amy Dunne (Pike) who disappears from her home on the day of her fifth wedding anniversary to her husband Nick (Affleck).We have to applaud Gillian Flynn, a novelist turned screenwriter that composes a tense and mystery story that evokes a fascinating social commentary on marriage and media. A taut thriller, some of which may find bloated, but still satisfying by credits end. There are quibbles you can find in certain character motivations or certain events that lead to our ultimate resolution but it's not enough to ruin the experience. Flynn launches herself in the Oscar race for Best Adapted Screenplay with a very good chance of standing on stage this year.On one hand we have Ben Affleck, an actor of considerable talent that showcases another notch in his belt for his career. Reserved and orchestrated with impressive restraint, Affleck keeps the audience on the edge of their seats with audible suspicion. We've seen him in movies like ""Hollywoodland"" and ""Argo,"" both of which brought him great acclaim. This will likely be one that will follow suit.Unfortunately must admit that I discovered the beautiful Rosamund Pike in Lone Scherfig's ""An Education"" over five years ago. Since then, I've only gotten glimpses in features like ""Made in Dagenham"" and ""Jack Reacher."" A career topping turn as evolved in her newest work as Amy Dunne in ""Gone Girl."" I don't think I've seen a more complex female character that allows an actress to go places we haven't seen in quite some time. Pike is a revelation, an actress that should run the gauntlet for every Best Actress award in 2014. She's passionate, intense, and damn near impenetrable, taking risks that pay off for every single movie moment she's involved in. I absolutely loved her.You can't deny that meticulous and craftsman genius that is embedded within director David Fincher. ""The Social Network"" and ""Se7en"" have been prime examples of how to tell a well executed story. Stylistically, ""Gone Girl"" offers nothing amazingly new for his repertoire. Director of Photography Jeff Cronenweth uses his same techniques that have made him one of the most exciting cinematographers of today. The real technical highlight is the score of Oscar-winners Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. Balanced, unsettling, and musically tense, the duo develop another stunning score for the year.The supporting cast all have high points, most notably the spunky Carrie Coon of HBO's ""The Leftovers."" Her quirk and ferocity stand up as an unforgettable highlight. Tyler Perry gives the world a terrific example of life outside ""Madea"" and by God, I want some more. He steals many of his scenes shared with his co-stars. Neil Patrick Harris also delivers in his brief amount of screen time, one that will channel a new generation's Anthony Perkins. Kim Dickens, Casey Wilson, Patrick Fugit, and ESPECIALLY Missi Pyle make their marks accordingly. Don't be surprised to see the Screen Actors Guild cite this for Best Cast Ensemble.As a vehicle for awards players, the big chances will stand for Screenplay and Best Actress, both of which are win-worthy. In some ways, I feel Fincher has crafted his equivalent to Martin Scorsese's ""The Departed,"" and obviously that worked out for very well for the overdue director. This is something that audiences will eat up, talk about at their water coolers, and probably revisit for years to come. It's hard to imagine how an awards member will see it but it will definitely appeal to many out there.""Gone Girl"" is an undeniable winner. Haunting, unpredictable, and completely unforgettable, Fincher's film stands tall as one of the best things to be produced this year. Their might be similarities to ""Prisoners,"" maybe even ""Psycho,"" but ""Gone Girl"" has enough going for itself to stand on its own.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Probably the best film of the year. A masterpiece.,"I must point out here that I have not read the original source novel, also I will be extremely careful to avoid any spoilers as this film MUST NOT be spoiled. Aside from that, I feel totally confident in declaring this as the best film I have seen all year. Fincher has crafted one of the all time great thrillers, and has done so in an aggressive and brutal fashion. Although its premature to call it a career best, its fair to say that this film deserves to be in contention for that honor at least.Firstly, the acting is stellar. I demand an Oscar for Rosamund Pike, for giving the best performance I have seen all year. I will not describe why it is so remarkable, as it is a clue to some of the film's reveals, however you will be shocked suffice to say. Affleck is perfectly cast and works well, playing to his strengths and probably giving the performance of his career. In the supporting cast, Carrie Coon and Kim Dickens are great and I hope they receive more work in the future, possibly even some high profile starring roles. However, better still is Tyler Perry, delivering a shockingly hilarious and fitting performance, showcasing impeccable comic timing and oozing personality in every scene. The film has a cast for the ages, everybody works well and every scene raises the bar further into the stratosphere.The screenplay is excellent, written by the writer of the book (Gillian Flynn) and containing all the delicacy and detail of a great novel. However with enough of an adaptation to feel naturalistic, its not 2 and half hours of having a novel read out to you, as it easily could have been. It gives the actors all the space and material to show their skill and presence on screen and has a twisted plot line worthy of Fincher.The cinematography is wonderful. It is shot with the detail and precision of a master, a title which Fincher has more than earned by this stage. Well balanced lighting, a fitting palette, it truly looks perfect. The set design is also perfectly planned and well constructed, encouraging you to look for even the slightest clues in Fincher/Flynn's warped minds.Overall, I implore you to watch this brutal and devilishly twisted little number from one of the best collaborations in modern cinema. If Flynn writes every Fincher film in the future, with Pike as the star, then I'd be overjoyed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Overrated...,"Was looking forward to this film, had read positive reviews, etc. Very disappointed after seeing this film. I admit it's not completely horrible, but definitely not in the same category as other top rated films on this site. This is not an 8 or 9 IMO. Story and acting reaches a comedic level, where at one point during the film I thought I was watching a satirical dark comedy. Definitely a watchable film, but not close to deserving the hype and attention it received. Rosamund Pike was certainly memorable and in my opinion gave a much better performance than Patricia Arquette in Boyhood, but again at times I found the story downright laughable and implausible.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

It's one of those movie that when you think you have everything figured out, it makes another turn...In a good way. David Fincher is a great director and I was impressed with his movie ""Zodiac"" which this has a similar vibe going for. Except with more immersive elements and less detective aspects going for it.

An incredible adaptation,"A novel as brilliantly disturbing as this deserves a proper adaptation, and this movie delivers in spades. It's incredibly faithful, and steers as close to the source material as any adaptation ever did, only changing/condensing/ejecting what it genuinely needs to in order to fit into a movie's runtime without being overly long.The casting is fantastic, the performances believable, the editing great...everything about the movie is a joy to behold, and does the source material a great service by changing so little of it.Rosamund Pike, particularly, is a revelation here. The way she effortlessly switches between Amy's multiple facets, from sweet and people-pleasing to determined and conniving, and everything in between. Yes, the whole cast are great, but this is truly Rosamund Pike's movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
880 reviews and counting....,"I just saw ""Gone Girl"" tonight. However, by now this will be the 880th review, so I will try to be very brief. After all, just about everything that can be said about the film probably has. Suffice to say I liked the film but think its extremely high rating on IMDb is perhaps a bit higher than I'd rate it. It's good...but I can't see it as the 140th best film of all time. So what did I like? Well, the Nancy Grace-like 'journalist', Ellen Abbott, was terrific and I am happy about anything that makes Ms. Grace look bad. I also liked most of the acting. I actually thought Ben Afleck was really good. The plot also reminded me a lot of a great old film ""Leave Her to Heaven"". But I also felt the film was too graphic--too bloody and too much nudity for me to let a kid or teen or even more see the film. Overall, an impressive film but not among my favorites of 2014.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Gone Girl,"Gone Girl an adaption of the stunning 2012 novel of the same name by Gillian Flynn. It chronicles the aftermath of Amy Elliot-Dunne (Pike) disappearing on her fifth wedding anniversary, and in flashback how she and Nick Dunne (Affleck) first met.The casting is brilliant. Pike captures Amy's chameleon nature, while Affleck is suitably sympathetic but aloof. Carrie Coon makes Go a very likable character, while Detective Boney is handled well in Kim Dickens' hands.Despite a hefty running time, Gone Girl does not have a dull second. The twisty-turny plot keeps you on the edge of your seat with the shocks played out in much the same way as the book. Altogether, it's a very faithful adaption with only some superfluous detail left out for simplicity. A treat for fans of the book is the slightly reworked ending. The only original material in the entire movie is reserved for the closing moments, giving those familiar with Flynn's original an opportunity to be left wondering what's going to happen next, one more time.Although the transposition from page to screen was virtually flawless, Gone Girl loses something in movie form. The twists are slightly less sudden and shocking; the subtlety of the relationship's transformation over the years is less intricate; and the ambiguity of who to support is less pronounced. It loses some of its complexity in determining the heroes and villains, and for that reason it doesn't quite live up to the source material.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Disappointing,"I'd been wanting to see it with great expectation, since I'd heard good critics and I think,or thought, Fincher was an interesting director. Seven and Fight Club were good, intense, demonstrations of this, and of Fincher's mastering of the genre.I should have second guessed, since he also made incredibly boring films like Benjamin Button and video collections of the most distasteful musicians.On to the movie. The first hour is like an episode of CSI, in fact, I think it actually is. The case is therefore obvious and what bothers me most is that these people underestimate the audience and don't even bother to check the story they're telling. Unlike CSI, this movie is like 2.30hs long, which is completely unnecessary, but Fincher seems to think, like many others, that length equals quality, or at least Oscar consideration.And when you think: OK, we're only in the middle of the movie, this might get better (because you can't think that they've made such a fuss over this mediocre film), then it gets worse.Someone commented that there was a twist but it lasted like 10 minutes and then it just flat-lined, that's exact. After the fleeting twist there's another boring drama hour, that adds a super flaw to the film: improbability. In the suspense genre, the use of clues, the credibility of the script, is everything.This movie is full of loose ends and the plot just doesn't work.I say, the only remarkable thing in the film is the casting, Rosamund Pike is right for the part, Neil Patrick Harris does a great supporting role and Ben Affleck has the perfect dumb face for the lead.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Enjoyable!,"This stands out as a good suspense thriller that keeps you engaged. The movie is paced well. I'm a little surprised that Rosamund Pike is nominated for Best Actress - I didn't think her performance was that worthy - that's not to say it's bad, just not exceptional. Naturally having Ben Affleck as the lead gives this movie a lot more punch and he doesn't disappoint! Certainly deserved the hype it got. When the movie is over and you give it more thought there are a few holes in the storyline but that doesn't matter. It's meant to entertain you and that's what it does. It's not out to change your views or opinions on any subject. Sit back and enjoy it for what it is.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Good God Girl! What is she up to now.,"A visceral and intriguing blend of whodunit and disturbing romance...of sorts. I haven't read the book (eeeeek I hear the patron saints of 'books before movies' moan!), but this did impress me.Some of the dialogue felt sickly - but reminded me of how I felt when I was once in love- a very long time ago indeed! But none the less, the writing stuck out like a sore thumb, but when I thought about the style it made sense.It also proves that no matter what the situation, sometimes humans can just manipulate others by turning on the tears and conforming to generalised stereotypes and the story line highlights this along the way.A must watch for all you mystery hunters out there.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Disturbing and overwrought,"Right on the occasion of their fifth wedding anniversary, Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) finds that his wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike), has gone missing under suspicious circumstances. The police's attention soon turns to the husband just as the high-profile case turns into a media circus that uncovers dark secrets about a seemingly perfect marriage.While Fincher's direction is no doubt stylish, Gone Girl plays out a little too long for the ""urban myth"" type of thriller that is ends up being. A thought-provoking start turns into sheer shock as characters become harder and harder to sympathize with. The very convincing acting can't make up for an implausible and macabre script that made the movie a disappointment in my eyes. All it manages to achieve in matters of leaving the viewer petrified is lost in a contrived plot and an overindulgent runtime.6/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Great movie in spite of the ending seeming not quite perfect,"I just rewatched this film. I had forgotten a lot of the details. Overall I found it to be a fun movie to rewatch and felt that it holds-up better than most. If anything it might be more interesting to watch following the ""me too"" movement than it was when it came out just before the me too movement. Although the media focusing so much attention on this one story seemed more difficult for me to accept in 2020 than it did around 2014. There are just so many crazy news stories in 2020 that this sort of narrative doesn't seem like the kind of thing that could spark the kind of public attention which is shown in the movie. The 2014 world for this story seems to treat this missing wife story with the kind of interest one would only accept in 2020 of the wife or husband were big celebrity prior to one of them going missing.The other issue I have with the movie is that the very end just doesn't seem to wrap things up quite enough for a few characters. In particular the relationship between the wife and busband's twin after the wife returns isn't even really addressed. Afleck's character would seemingly need to be seen telling the sister if he is going to chose her or his wife to be his closest confident long term. He never has that opportunity in the end to show where he standsI'm not sure if maybe I'd like a scene which takes place years in the future or a few more months or maybe just a few days after the movie ends; But the male lead agreeing to have the baby just didn't seem to me like enough of an explanation of what a viewer could/should expect to happen down the line with the story to end right there.Both of these are relatively mild critiques. The story is overall largely original and well constructed. The acting and filming are great. There is some elements of visual art within the cinematography without it being distracting. The story really is only partially mysterious and not too surprising for the first half. What makes the story very interesting is what happens in the last half. I haven't read the book. But I see that the book author adapted her book into the feature film.The VO is used well. Often book authors use too much VO for adaptions. The pacing doesn't feel too slow or too rushed. And the story is interesting to follow. And given that both of the main characters have some serious flaws, it's important for the side characters to be likable and for the overall insanity of the story to keep the viewer interesting in the outcome in spite of the dysfunction and coldness of the main characters. The film succeeds in those regards. The twin sister, lawyer and main detective are all sympathetic characters to make up for the main two characters being largely flawed.It's definitely a film that I'd argue is worth seeing if you haven't yet had the opportunity.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"'My God, this place literally smells like feces.'","Gillian Flynn wrote the best selling novel and then adapted his own success to the screen. David Fincher (Fight Club, Se7en, The Social Network, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Panic Room, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, etc) directs this twisted tale of hate and anger and passion and deceit and obsession and the minds of sociopaths, and out comes a film being considered for an Oscar. Wow, are we all really into this?On the occasion of his fifth wedding anniversary, Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck, chubby and out of shape) reports that his wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike), has gone missing. Under pressure from the police (a very well cast Kim Dickens and Patrick Fugit et al) and a growing media frenzy, Nick's portrait of a blissful union begins to crumble. Soon his lies, deceits and strange behavior have everyone asking the same dark question: Did Nick Dunne kill his wife? Nick's sister Margo (Carrie Coon, excellent) is supportive and grounded, Nick's lawyer Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry, never better), Amy's previous lover Desi (Neil Patrick Harris), and a television interviewer Sharon Schieber (Sela Ward) and other actors who can't be mentioned because doing so would give the plot away make this very long and sick film work.So, very superb acting from everyone involved, careful direction that makes sure the audience is able to witness all the disgusting twists and turns of this warped story make it obvious why this is an Oscar contender. As a story it is a profoundly sad commentary on marriage, the paparazzi, gossip, television news casting, and our current hunger for sick stories that fail to resolve anything.

"Preparation for Mank: Gone Girl boasts one of the best screenplays of the decade, as well as some incredible casting choices.","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)This is it. The last David Fincher's film I'll be able to review before Mank, his next masterpiece... I hope. I've been through Se7en, Fight Club, Zodiac, The Social Network, and now it's time for Fincher's latest installment, Gone Girl. Clearly, Fincher loves to work with people he knows. Jeff Cronenweth has been his director of photography in half of his movies, same for Kirk Baxter as part of the editing team, and Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross in the musical score. Even his production designer, Donald Graham Burt, has been around since Zodiac. However, Fincher always works with a different writer, and this time, he partners up with a debutant screenwriter, Gillian Flynn, author of the original novel that originates this adaptation.Usually, when it comes to writers, I take this change of media with a grain of salt since writing a book isn't exactly the same as writing a screenplay (it's completely different, I was being generous). With that said, Flynn absolutely destroys my self-doubts, delivering one of the best scripts of 2014. From the exceptionally captivating, perplexing disappearance of Amy to the underlying theme about how press and media treat this type of news, Flynn's screenplay is impressively able to develop each and every narrative in the most perfect way possible. With a remarkable use of time/date stamps, the viewer follows in a detailed manner the events that build up to the tragic day through different perspectives, mainly Amy's and Nick's.This story's greatest accomplishment is how it makes the press influence what the viewer thinks about the characters, just like in real life. Nowadays, people don't even click to read the full article and understand its context. A single headline, as far from the truth as it might be, is enough to start a worldwide online debate. The same goes for television networks, and their news shows: if it's on the national news program, then it must be true, people think. I may be wrong when I wrote the whole ""change of media"" matter before, but of this, I'm sure: take every news article you read with a grain of salt because most of the time, the full, true story isn't entirely revealed.This takes me to Ben Affleck (Justice League, The Way Back) and what I consider one of the best casting choices of the respective decade. In case you don't know, Affleck has been pursued throughout his whole life by journalists who try their hardest to expose his personal life, no matter how disrespectful it may turn out to be. Nick goes through the exact same obstacle. There's non-stop news about Amy, and it only becomes a matter of time until Nick starts being accused of being a terrible husband, and ultimately the obvious killer, even though the press can't find a single proof. Affleck doesn't even need to incorporate a new character since he has the necessary life experience to offer an utterly brilliant performance. Definitely, one of my favorite actors working today.Since I'm in the realm of performances, I might as well continue with Rosamund Pike (Radioactive). Her interpretation of Amy is almost the opposite of Affleck's, in the sense that the latter gives a seemingly simple yet powerful display, while Pike has a much more complex, layered role. She can be menacing and scary but also loving and kind. The puzzle surrounding her disappearance is mostly based on a perspective enigma, as the viewer is told the same story through different lenses throughout the first half of the film. Honestly, this is probably a career-best performance for Pike, who portrays a character of extremes, allowing her to demonstrate her jaw-dropping emotional range.Carrie Coon (Margo Dunne) is another actress I've grown to deeply enjoy watching, and she's terrific as Nick's sister. Her chemistry with Affleck is spot-on, and I sincerely hope that one day she becomes one of the most coveted actresses in Hollywood. Tyler Perry (Tanner Bolt) is also pretty great as Nick's lawyer, but Kim Dickens is even greater as Detective Rhonda Boney, who partially plays the same role as the viewer by trusting that what she sees and hears is undoubtedly the ultimate truth. Flynn's screenplay is packed with twists and turns, some of them more surprising than others, but the third act saves an unexpected, shocking turn of events, leading to a powerful ending that will leave most audiences speechless, myself included.Two minor issues. One of them, you probably have already figured it out since I left Neil Patrick Harris (Desi Collings) out of the cast compliments above. Harris is fine as the character he portrays, but I can't help but feel that he wasn't the right actor for the role. This is a classic Fincher movie: dark, somber, depressing, tragic, and with its own share of violence and blood. In fact, it possesses one of the most disgusting, disturbing uses of blood in a single scene I've ever seen. Harris is an excellent actor, but he stands out from the rest of the cast, and not in a positive way. Again, fine performance, just not the right role for him. The other problem is admittedly an irrelevant nitpick regarding a few details story-wise that stretch the believability of everything just a bit.Nevertheless, this is still a phenomenal film, and it's another evidence of David Fincher's masterful visual filmmaking. Once again, Fincher works with his known crew members to create a sumptuous look and feel. With seamless editing, a memorable score, and fantastic camera work, Gone Girl is technically magnificent, but it's Gillian Flynn's debut screenplay that steals the spotlight. Boasting jaw-dropping twists, including an utterly shocking third act and respective ending, Flynn's narrative is incredibly engaging due to its remarkable structure and puzzling mystery, never losing an inch of excitement or interest. Ben Affleck is one of the best casting choices of the decade by interpreting a man whose life is deeply affected by the press and media, which should never be fully trusted (a clear and powerful message to the audience), while Rosamund Pike delivers her career-best performance with an emotionally devastating display. Despite the misstep of casting Neil Patrick Harris in such a dark movie and a couple of nitpicks regarding the investigation, everything and everyone else turn this into one of the best films of the 2010s.Rating: A",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
The entire movie is a masterpiece,"From the beginning soundtrack, the day passing by, the houses, to the very ending that let you think. I started watching this movie as a recommendation and ended up being one of my favorite all times. The Mystery it's not what you're quite used, the inner ""detective"" will try come out and will, but it's quite obvious at a point. The best part is, it's not when you find out what happened that you get bored, it only feels even more interesting and deep and sucks you in and the intentions gets more and more clearer to the viewer and they will connect to the movie and not want to look away a single moment.

This movie won't let you tell the next scene.,"Initially, I wasn't convinced about this movie. I thought it was a simple story about a woman who went missing, someone was guilty, or her husband, or someone was trying to frame her husband. Flashes of her life appear in the background. However, my understanding of the film changed from minute to minute. Halfway through, the first plot twist appeared and changed everything. I already understood this movie in a completely different way and I thought that its ending would be simple since we already knew everything. But no - the filmmakers continue to surprise us with further plot twists. The ending of the film is completely different than I expected. A bittersweet ending.

"""Don't settle for anybody just so you can have somebody""","Here's a film that keeps you hooked from start to finish. Watching the trailer, I thought I'd be able to predict all the plot twists well in advance, but it turned out to be just the opposite. Even the way the trailer clips were arranged managed to build anticipation without giving away any major reveals.I watched this movie based on recommendations from people who told me it would make me rethink trust in relationships-and it did exactly that. It dives into the dark, unsettling side of truly knowing someone you love and have committed to for life, exploring how things can take unexpected turns when secrets start to surface.What really struck me, though, was that even after all the shocking reveals, the film delves into a new layer, where despite the toxicity, manipulation, and betrayal, the couple chooses to stay together. This adds a fascinating, almost haunting portrayal of a relationship stuck in a loop-where people stay together, not because of genuine happiness, but because of familiarity and the fear of being alone. It's a mirror to real-life relationships, showing how people can often prefer to stay in a broken relationship, then to break and create what they need.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Daring and Vindictive,"The most significant thing that's being emphasize in this film is the conspiring story of a husband and wife relationship. Director David Fincher phenomenally distinguished the resentful side and perspective of the two main characters (played by Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike) and guides audiences through dark and pessimistic plot development. The mood throughout the film complements with the mysterious conflict and I liked how Fincher made the idea of the climax extremely confidential. Rosamund Pike delivers her most menacing and adventurous performance of her career and makes ""Gone Girl"" more interesting and engaging to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Too far,"There was a point at which I thought, ""This movie is brilliant! I never saw that coming!"" It had me second-guessing my own perspective as a viewer. The plot was incredibly well thought out. Then, it went to far. It wasn't just too long in terms of run-time, it was too long in terms of the number of plot twists before the end. It got too incredibly outlandish, cliché and sensational. In the end, I had no idea what the artful manipulator's end game was. What was the motivation? I don't know what you want! This movie, like it's character, should have quit while it was ahead. Still, I think this is one of those stories that's going to stick with me.

I was really happy with the casting choices and how it follows the plot of the book so closely. Also, round of applause to Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike who kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the whole movie even though I already knew what was going to happen. You could tell they put a lot of hard work into it and they both fully embraced their characters and it payed off. It has a pretty long screen time of 145 minutes but it doesn't drag for a minute.

"Exciting, frustrating, emotional, confusing, brilliant!","I actually watched the film before reading the book, and have since become an avid Gillian Flynn fan and love both, Dark Places and, Sharp Objects, the latter of which I am extremely excited about seeing as a series.
Back to the film...What starts off as a fairly normal missing persons thriller, quickly becomes something that you least expect. It is extremely faithful to the book, which I always approve of and very little was even left out. Ben Affleck is fantastic and whatever you may have thought/think about him as a person, do not let that cloud your judgement when watching, Gone Girl, as he is really is believable. However it is Rosamund Pike who steals the show as the missing wife. She is just outstanding, really fantastic. There is enough sex, detective work, subplots, good dialogue etc to interest fans of the different components of a thriller, but for me the overall story line is just so perfect that I wonder if it truly ever could have failed as a film.I am currently waiting for my two next favorite books to make it to screen, What Happened to Michael by N F Paupe, who has the equal power of deception and intrigue that Flynn does and , The Dry, by Jane Harper, a book that will explode ( literally) on screen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"""The bigger the lie, they more believe it""","""Gone Girl"" is an impressive psychological thriller. This film is overwhelming, it takes you to be bored almost never during the viewing. A film that is carried by the skill of Fincher and the almost perfect writing of the film, with sensational actors. Ben Affleck confirms his high stage with a great performance, although I believe that in this film more shine Rosamund Pike which perfectly applies the madness of his character. Fincher is confirmed on a very high level and in my opinion this film is quite inferior to Fight Club or Seven, which are real masterpieces, but Gone Girl keeps up. I liked the structure of the relationship between Nick and Amy, with a beautiful origin story and a perfect character evolution. I liked the secondary characters, especially Margo, but also the other additions were up to par. The script and photography are exceptional, the soundtracks have kept me in tension above all in the second part of the film, the most interesting. I loved the way of telling the couple's past and present through writing Amy, making you understand everything one piece at a time. The ending of the film is very successful and left me in deep anxiety, probably seeing some of his previous films now I have deduced that Fincher does not like the final decided. I can't wait to enjoy this film again to understand it better but above all to see another Fincher film to see if he is really the thriller magician..

"A Twisted Tale of Love, Lies, and Betrayal","Gone Girl is a masterful psychological thriller that redefines the genre with its intricate storytelling, intense suspense, and nuanced exploration of human relationships. Directed by David Fincher and based on Gillian Flynn's best-selling novel, the film delves into themes of deception, love, betrayal, and media manipulation, creating a gripping narrative that keeps viewers captivated until the final frame.Rosamund Pike delivers a career-defining performance as Amy Dunne, portraying her with chilling precision and unsettling charisma. Her multifaceted portrayal of a woman who is equal parts victim and villain is nothing short of mesmerising, anchoring the film with a presence that is as compelling as it is terrifying. Opposite her, Ben Affleck excels as Nick Dunne, embodying a character whose charm and ambiguity keep the audience constantly questioning his motives. The dynamic between Pike and Affleck is electric, intensifying the tension as the layers of their relationship unravel.David Fincher's direction is meticulous, enhancing the film's dark and unsettling tone. Every scene is crafted with precision, supported by the haunting and atmospheric score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. The music amplifies the film's sense of dread, perfectly complementing Fincher's moody visuals and measured pacing. Gillian Flynn's screenplay adaptation captures the essence of her novel with razor-sharp dialogue and a narrative structure that seamlessly transitions between past and present, truth and deception.What sets Gone Girl apart is its ability to transcend the mystery genre, offering a profound exploration of the complexities of marriage and the façades people construct in relationships. The film's commentary on media sensationalism and public perception adds another layer of depth, making it not just a story about a missing woman but a critique of societal voyeurism and the manipulation of truth.The plot twists are executed flawlessly, subverting expectations at every turn and keeping viewers in a constant state of suspense. As the story unfolds, it reveals the darker corners of human behaviour, challenging the audience to grapple with moral ambiguity and the fine line between victimhood and culpability.In conclusion, Gone Girl is a tour de force of storytelling, performance, and direction. Its blend of psychological intrigue, social commentary, and intense drama creates a film that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll. With its unforgettable characters, masterful execution, and thought-provoking themes, Gone Girl stands as one of the finest examples of modern psychological thrillers and a cinematic experience that continues to inspire conversation and analysis.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Potentially Great Film Ruined By Ending,"I will preface this review by saying that, for no particular reason, it took my wife and I 5 years to finally get around to this movie we have always wanted to see. The first hour was enjoyable, interesting story, good acting, endless possibilities. The second hour even better, amazing twist, even more possibilities! However.... the last ten minutes destroyed all hope for this to be the great film we anticipated based on reviews we have read over the years. A terribly unrealistic, unsatisfying ending brought this almost great movie from a 9/10 rating to the 6/10 you see before you. Not to dwell but the ending was so disappointing that it reminded me of an old low budget horror movie from the 80s that leaves an opening at the end for a sequel that would end up even more underwhelming than the original. I am not recommending that anyone skip this movie, just cut it off around the 2 hr 20 min mark and make up your own ending. ANYTHING would be better than the ending that played out. Oh... the unnecessary fading to black in and out of every scene gave the feel of something edited on an old desktop.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Massively overrated. Great performances. Troubled script.,"This movie has problems.It's not necessarily a problem, but the main characters are very unlikable. Smug, miserable, privileged white people with white people problems. My first attempt at watching the movie, it turned me off so much that I turned the movie off after about 45 mins. My second attempt, I decided it was intentional, some dark satire. I thought of the Coen Bros, whose murder stories are also full of un-likeable characters and losers. Instead of the eccentric larger-than-life characters of their movies, Gone Girl's are all cynical and beaten down by um years of wealth and success and selfishness. OK, rolling with it!Not really feeling any sympathy for any of the characters, more of a bemused revulsion, I was kept captivated by the twists and turns of the plot. There is a big twist to the entire attitude/feeling of the movie half-way through - it didn't work super well for me, being met with a slightly exasperated yell of ""come ON"" and a laugh. I stuck with it, but the tonal change is dramatic and for me, lands on coming across as silly. It's accompanied by a long, cynical important monologue from a main character that I think(?) is supposed to be somewhat sympathetic. But it's all cliché. It's like a parody of feminism and the media. It lands awkwardly.The movie continues to take some twists and turns, and they hook you, the pacing works, it hits a stride. And then the main suspense of the movie wraps up. And then it continues for another 20 minutes. You await the final twist. Ohhh where is this finally going to end up? Nowhere. It ended 20 minutes before. Just really hammering home the cynicism. I literally hated the ending. It leaves massive plot holes, abandons all the characters to their miserable lives, and made me want to throw something at the screen for the 20 minutes of reveling-in-cynicism at the end. One of those movies where eventually it just fades out abruptly and the credits quietly roll. Ohhh powerful.. Nah. Exasperating.It's worth watching, all the acting is phenomenal, including Affleck, it's great casting for him, and Pike is supremely hate-able (superb). But the characters hardly even develop. Only the main two characters do - they're cynical and miserable and learn to embrace being cynical and miserable. One becomes more human and believable, the other, far less. Feels odd. The side characters are completely undeveloped and essentially generic, but the actors do what they can. NPH is a stand-out, always great when allowed to tap into a sinister side.The twists and turns of the plot hit a high point about 3/4 of the way through -- at that point, despite the repulsive characters, I'm in for the ride. But it just kinda falls apart from there. Inconsistency. Long, thoughtful monologues give way to rando crap happening without a lot of attention to detail or interstitial shots. The dramatic twists are a bit over-advertised, inviting clever explanations for how it all works that are instead quickly glazed over...Ending with a tortuous 20 minute cynical wallow of an ending. I found it all a bit too pretentious, and it just sent me back to the beginning of the movie and my first impressions. I really was supposed to care about these smug, miserable, privileged people - is that who this movie was made for? A bit nauseating. It's no cynical cousin to the Coen Bros.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

It's the kind of films you start disbelieving in the idea of marriage from.,"The film is absolutely gripping from the first scene. The raw and chilling look of the wife makes us want to see the layers of her character. And the husband is also very well sketched in his flawed relationship to his twin. Interestingly confusing at first whether or not he is the murderer, but soon resolves that question and takes the story forward. The transformations of look of the wife is spectacular. Acting- A grade. Plotting of murder-amazing. Characters- believable, even the wife is relateable inspite her actions. What she wanted is what people want from each other in today's relationships. Marriage is compromising self to get the love of the partner, and wanting the other to be as they like, it's this relateable theme which grabs the attention on a deeper level.
No matter the compromises, things do get beneficial at the end. Oh! What a sarcasm on the face of people from the fine storyteller!",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Cinched !!!,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend, his sister, and her husband. We were all enthralled watching this drama-thriller about a man whose wife had disappeared and the revelations about them both. Ben Affleck is the star with nice supporting turns by Neil Patrick Harris, Tyler Perry (yes, the guy who's usually known as Medea!), Carrie Coon, Casey Wilson, and many others. However, the most compelling performance is from Rosamond Pike. I remember liking her as a Bond girl in Die Another Day but here, she's really on fire if you know what I mean! All I'll say now is you may or not be surprised by the twists and turns that happen in this film but you won't be bored, that's for sure! David Fincher has done it again!

A MUST WATCH !!,"Acclaimed director David Fincher presents a tense thriller adapted from Gillian Flynn's (screenplay is by Flynn herself) best selling novel of the same name - the story of a marriage gone bad... bad... BAD... a super-twisted & knotty BAD !! This movie explores the vulnerabilities, helplessness, frustration and the sheer desperation of being tied down in a doomed marriage.Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) and his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) are writers who have lost their jobs in the recession and are forced to relocate from New York to small town Missouri on account of Nick's mother who is diagnosed with fatal cancer and Nick's new job as a teacher in a local college. On the day of their fifth marriage anniversary, Nick, on returning home, finds Amy missing. There are also signs of struggle. Nick alerts the cops who begin an investigation that is bathed in the spotlights of a 24*7 news media melee, given the fact that Amy was a minor celebrity. As the hunt for a missing person transmutes into a murder investigation, skeletons start tumbling out of what was once considered a ""forever after"" fairy tale marriage and the needle of suspicion, slowly, but surely, turns towards Nick.What are the problems that caused these die-hard, hot-for-each-other romantics to fall out ? And, how bad is the fall-out ? Is it so frustrating and are they so desperate to kill for it ? The movie narrates all this and more in a plot that presents one twist after another which leads the viewer to believe one way only to trump them in the very next scene in deceit with their feelings oscillating between Nick and Amy with each unravelling of the knots. I refrain from detailing any further of the story which would be providing spoilers that would spoil the viewer's experience.Marriage is HARD WORK. It is a continuing exercise in mutual understanding which sustains and nurtures the seeds of mutual attraction which are supposed to sprout into an everlasting and deepening bond with strong roots. A continuing work in progress to build and reinforce compatibility through mutual care, trust and most importantly, communication. But, many, if not most, marriages trap the couple as hapless prisoners in an humdrum existence constructed on the ashes of their hyper-expectant beginnings that are divorced from their real selves. While one may never know the veracity of the adage of marriages being forged in heaven, there are more than ample proofs that once the frills & thrills of initial courtship fade off, deficits in mutual compatibility and communication could well render the marriage as a living hell with no escape.Nick & Amy Elliott Dunne traverse the entire spectrum of a marriage from its blissful beginnings to banal existence and onto fatal desperation in all of five years. While the rifts start appearing when the reality of depression, retrenchments and financial issues start to bite in, are they the cause or merely symptoms of some deeper fissures ? Despite seven years - two years of courtship and five years of being married - of knowing each other, how well do they know and understand each other ? What and how deep are their feelings for each other ? Do they know each other at all ? Or, are they just familiar with the exterior personality that each wants to present the other ?David Fincher has crafted a nail biting non-linear thriller which while being centered on an intriguing whodunit murder mystery also transcends the genre to explore the murky waters of modern marriages as well as that maddening phenomenon of our days called 24*7 news media. He pries open the Nick & Amy's layer by lifeless layer to pull out the diseased underside hiding behind the picture perfect exteriors. He also presents a commentary on the all pervasive sensation hungry news media which thrives on tabloid-isation of any news with scant regard to issues of privacy or even decency. News anchors - a la Arnab - preside over daily news shows which are stage managed kangaroo courts dishing out near vigilante justice based on insinuations and innuendos.Fincher's masterly skills are in crafting a film that strikes a fine balance in blending a first rate thriller with a nuanced study on the growing morass of modern marriages which are staged on flimsy foundations which end up spawning disenchanted couples and a growing number of divorces and dysfunctional families, societal hypocrisy, sensation seeking news media and an industry of attorneys who survive on familial discord. In examining the life of Nick & Amy, Fincher holds a mirror to our own relationships forcing the views to reflect upon them.Ben Affleck is absolutely stunning as Nick Dunne, sporting a role with several shades of grey which requires him to be a consummate romantic to completely outwitted husband caught in the quagmire. But, it is Rosamund Pike who aces the tricky role of ""Amazing"" Amy showcasing with equal ease, romance, charisma, glamour and chilling malice. She is chameleon like in moving from being vulnerable to venomous to calculating to crowd pleasing to much more effortlessly. She is sure to earn several Best Actress nominations for this titular role and may also win a few. The spot-on supporting cast consisting of Neil Patrick Harris as a creepy jilted ex stalking Amy, Tyler Perry as an attorney specialising in defending husbands accused of murdering their wife, Carrie Coon as Nick's twin sister who is only support and Kim Dickens as the homicide detective are effective. The background score by Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross provides an accentuating texture to the proceedings.A slick, superlative and layered thriller that is a disturbing, yet, edge-of-the-seat entertainer that gets under your skin and makes you squirm. The following lines that open and close the movie are likely to resonate within the viewer long after they have finished watched it.""What are you thinking? What are you feeling?

Great movie ruined by terrible ending.,"At the time of watching this movie, it had a rating of 8.4 on IMDb. I normally trust that whatever movie has an 8.0 rate or more should definitely be a great film. Well, I hope this is the exception that confirms the rule, because this movie might be one of the worst I have ever seen. Why? you must be wondering. Because of the last 30 minutes. Up until that point I was really enjoying it, generally speaking. But man, that ending is appalling, utterly atrocious, and plainly nonsensical! A great thriller turned into a love story of pathetic proportions in a matter of minutes. The only positive i found at the end was the way they portray the power of media and public opinion in society. The rest should go down the garbage shoot.In these types of movies, there's only one premise: keep it real. If you do, you'll have a great film, which will improve with every twist and turn you add. If you don't keep it real, and your thriller becomes too surrealistic, you'll find yourself going from cleverness and brilliance to false cleverness and stupidity.

Makes me scared of getting married,"David Fincher's immersive and intimate direction has enabled Affleck and Pike to create a truly terrifying depiction of how humans will alter their own personalities to get what they truly desire from a relationship.
Affleck's excellent performance really takes the audience on his emotional journey to hell and back, and his interactions with all of the supporting characters feel incredibly genuine, and exactly how anyone would react should they go through the same emotional trauma that he does. However, the true star of the show is Rosamund Pike. She is able to portray so much escalating hate over the course of the first half of the film, and her cunning personality really shines as she is able to manipulate those around in order to fit her ever adjusting motives as the landscape around her continues to alter in different ways.
All in all, the direction, acting and cinematography all come together in such a way that conveys a message of hate and how far someone will go to make the person who has hurt them the most suffer even more than they have. The film ends in such a crushing way it gifts the audience a new perspective on their current morality.

Yes, you might say that some parts leave questions about how realistic it is, but that's not what this movie is about and not what the movie should be aiming for. It's about a journey for the viewers, to see what's going to happen next, you should let yourself go and see how a story about insanity is going to unfold.

Gone Girl is the FILM of the year. (unless another can be better),"This film is phenomenal. If you have read the book, you would understand why this film was going to be just like the best-selling novel of 2012. It was suspenseful, absorbing and kept you thinking on what would happen next? But the big question was:Who killed Amy Dunne?Gone Girl starts on the day of Nick and Amy Dunne's fifth anniversary, but things goes awry when Amy becomes missing. No one knows where she is or where she would run off to, but the looks of a struggle in the Dunne's residence points fingers to the number one suspect: her clueless husband Nick.The movie twists and turns, transitioning from the highs and lows in Amy's diary to the first day, two days, four days and so on of her disappearance. It'll have you on the edge of your seat, guessing on what you think what happened to her, but I bet all the answers were wrong.It was amazing and to make it even better, the author Gillian Flynn was the mastermind behind the screenplay. She brought her own baby to life and made it into this cinematic WTF fest until the very end. It has you wanting to know more about these two characters. You don't know who you can trust until you see the biggest WTF twist in the movie. As if you think the twists in this film is over, you're wrong.Ben Affleck was amazing as Nick Dunne, the strange behavior of a man, trying to understand what happened to his wife, but all his secrets comes to light as well in all of this frenzy that became his life. This is the best I have seen Affleck in a while.Rosamund Pike.... I have seen this woman in several movies, but this film. The way she portrayed Amy Dunne, the beautiful, All-American wife, was ridiculously amazing. She has you in the palm of your hand, believing every single word she gives until she lets you slip between her fingers. I am happy to see her go as far as she did in this film. I can definitely see Oscar buzz in her direction.David Fincher did it once again with this film. He puts in the place, and it makes you feel like you're there, taking every step he did with this film.

"Intense and Beautifully Acted, A True Modern Day Masterpiece,","Gone Girl is an incredible movie with an extremely well written storyline and an absolutely outstanding cast. This film is easily one of the greatest thrillers I have ever seen, some scenes are truly terrifying, mostly because all of the events in this movie could happen in real life, and the built up of suspense is magnificent. Ben Affleck does a fantastic job and this is easily a career highlight for him, and although these movies are nothing alike, it does give me new hope for him playing Batman. The best performance was without a doubt Rosamund Pike, her character easily had the best dialogue, she didn't seem like an easy character to play and she delivered her performance perfectly, she didn't hold back, she was creepy, disturbing and in a very strange way, very likable, I really hope this will change Pike's career for the better, she's shown here just how talented she really is. I think the film is formatted exactly as a thriller should be, starts off very mysterious without giving much away about the main characters and gives us more information throughout, without spoon feeding us, and the further it goes the more thrilling it gets, which is very pleasing. Tyler Perry and Neil Patrick Harris,two actors who I would previously only associate with comedy, actually pull off genuinely great dramatic performances, I was skeptical about them starring in it but they were great, I really hope to see them in more dramas in the future, also a scene involving Harris's character, which I won't spoil, is certainly the movies highlight, a beautiful piece of film making. Beautifully filmed, unpredictable, thrilling, mysterious and filled with twists, David Fincher and everyone involved in this deserves a huge path on the back for making what I consider to be the best movie of 2014, I haven't given a film a perfect ten out of ten rating in a long time, but Gone Girl deserves it, a must see for all moviegoers.Nick Dunne is suspected of killing his wife Amy after she mysteriously disappears, although several evidence in their house suggests otherwise.Best Performance: Rosamund Pike",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Extraordinary story !,Daym! What a movie! Love the way the thrill goes on for the first hour of the movie! I USUALLY Don't WRITE REVIEWS THO BUT THIS ONE... this one NAILED IT!One thing that should have been corrected was that the movie should have been for a 2 hour film! Scenes should have been cut between but OVERALL it was a great movie! The thrill of finding the murderer should have gone on ! right till the end of the movie! And the rest could have been brought up in a new movie .. getting 2 movies easily from this story!Anyways a great movie!

"Great premise, weak characters.","Gone Girl is broken up into two parts, as the twist of the story happens right in the middle. Having never seen that before, It's hard to deny that I was very engaged and interested to see the story flip in on itself. What I found most impressive was the way the film radically changed my perception of it's characters several times through my first watch.Unfortunately, I do think this film is held back by some seriously lack luster performances. It shines in it's ability to tell you just enough to be invested in the protagonist, whilst saving his flaws for fascinating reveals. However, Ben Afflecks relaxed schlub is highly forgettable and fails to deliver any convincing emotion, and Rosamund Pikes blank faced sociopath is equally uninspired.Overall, Gone Girl offers an interesting plot ripe for inspiration. However, the characters were either written or performed in a way that they themselves were not as interesting as the things that were happening around them. If you find a story more important than compelling performance, I would highly recommend Gone Girl.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Will you love or hate the movie after you have watched it?,"The movie is clever, fresh and charming and at the same time cruel, overbearing and dumb. The actors and the director have made a great job. It has a story that will keep you watching till the end. At the same time, the story is a puzzle and you want to resolve that. It's possible that you will find the key to resolve the puzzle while watching it. You will enjoy more if you don't resolve it, but still, i think the movie is worth watching if you don't mind about the strange feelings you have after seeing it.In other words... I'm feeling like i have been at a great party and now waked up the next day with some headache but at the same time have stories to tell from the night before without remembering what happened at the end. So, if you don't mind the headache go for it. But be warned, if you go to the party, you know how it will end. Right? I love and hate Gone Girl.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Strong and riveting thriller with a twist,"Ben Affleck has been a great actor in recent years and I was glad to see him in this movie. Gone Girl was an intense, powerful but engaging movie that leaves you breathless at times. The movie however is not perfect or even near perfect, it has its flaws. At various points, the movie was very monotoned and moved as slow as a snail. There are also a few questions that are left unanswered, mainly dealing with the character Amy and her motives. Then there were several scenes that didn't seem relevant to the plot. On the other hand, the movie had some positive factors.Ben Affleck's acting was pretty great, the best of his performances I've seen since Good Will Hunting. Rosamund Pike's performance was pretty good too. However, the best aspect of the movie was not the performances but the plot twists. Around halfway through the film, you learn shocking truths about some of the characters that would make your jaw drop. If you ask me, I was caught off guard by some of these characters. I couldn't tell whether they were innocent or bad but thats the beauty of the characters.Now I've never read the book so I don't know how good the book is compared to the movie. Overall, the movie is very worth watching, especially if you are a Ben Affleck fan.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

On hand is also Tyler Perry as an attorney, Neil Patrick Harris as Amy's ex-beau Desi, Kim Dickens and Patrick Fugit as the police investigating the case, and Sela Ward as Sharon Scheiber.

Entertaining psycho-thriller,"Gone Girl keeps you guessing for a while about one thing - did he do it - and then keeps you guessing for a while about another thing. It's hard to talk about the plot without giving away spoilers.The story describes the complex relationship of two writers who meet, get together, then move from a big city to a less big place. You are left guessing what each one is thinking and doing, and why. Affleck does a good job as Nick Dunne, the good looking down-on-his-luck guy. He loves his wife, or does he? His wife loves him, or does she? Then she is Gone, one day, like that, and you ask - what happened.Rosamund Pike is terrific as the wife, Amy Dunne, a talented author with a complex mind, and complex past with her parents. Her acting is spectacular throughout. I remember her from the Bond film - Miranda Frost - and here she delivers too.Affleck's movie sister - Margo - who plays his twin, is equally fantastic and emotional throughout.It's the acting that makes this a very good movie. The story itself is a bit simple once you see what is happening. Then it moves to a cat and mouse game, and the finish where you sit there and think, humh, OK, that's one way to end this. My only con is there are sexual scenes that I think were pushed a bit too much into the graphics - a bit more subtlety might have improved this movie.See this movie if you like thrillers that keep you guessing till the end.

Loved the book; loved the movie,"(No spoilers!) I was so up for the Gone Girl movie (trailer) because the book was one of my ""Best Reads of 2013."" The movie could have disappointed in so many ways, and it did not. According to the credits book author Gillian Flynn wrote the screenplay, and in the few places the movie departed from the printed page, it didn't make a big difference.The acting throughout is terrific. Ben Affleck, is a natural playing everyman Nick Dunne caught in snares of lies. Rosamund Pike (An Education), amazing as Amazing Amy. In a radio interview director David Fincher said that after watching clips of so many actresses over the years, he can get a read on them and their acting tricks pretty quickly, but when he saw Pike's clips, he couldn't ""read"" her. It made him think she'd be perfect for the Gone Girl, and he was right.Also liked Tyler Perry as defense lawyer Tanner Bolt and Kim Dickens (Treme's chef Janette Desautel) as Detective Rhonda Boney. (By the way, do you know your spouse's blood type?) Everybody's manipulating someone, except maybe Nick's sister Margo (Carrie Coon). The omnipresent TV talk show hosts commenting in the background are too realistically sleazy to be all that entertaining. The movie website is as Fox News might have produced it.If you like a suspenseful story, you'll like the twists and turns of this one. If you haven't read the book, there'll be more surprises, but even if you have, it's an exciting tale. There remains a weak spot at the very end, but there's so much else that's laudatory, it's easy to forgive. Rotten Tomatoes critics rating: 87%; audience score 92%.

Crazy. Best movie I've seen in a while. Deserves to be in IMDb Top 50 list.,"This movie had really great writing. Was anyone surprised with the amount of dark humor in the movie. Not only was it dark and twisted, but it was hilarious! Very smart and witty writing. I've seen it two and a half times in theaters already. The novel is even better. Flynn wrote the screenplay so she was able to get the right tone and dialog, but there's just more room for it in a novel.I never really considered myself much of an Affleck fan before, but after Gone Girl I'd say that from now on I'll be seeing whatever he puts out. I liked The Town and Argo, and will admit he's a suitable director, but his acting wasn't anything special to me. But to me Gone Girl was an INCREDIBLE example of Affleck's acting and how he really is on a hot streak. So glad Fincher got him to do this, he's the perfect guy for the role, and if you haven't seen it yet, pleas go see it.I was also blown away by Rosamund Pike. I've admired her work for a while (she was one of the best things about Die Another Day IMO) but Gone Girl was something truly special. People are murmuring about Oscar buzz for her but at the very least I think this film will catapult her to the so-called A list.Upon my second viewing, it became abundantly clear that Gone Girl was a perverse Romantic Comedy, albeit a Dark Comedy. The kind of comedy only Fincher would have the cunning to pull off with a straight face. It plays like anything but upon the surface, but like Amy and Nick Dunne, there's plenty more than meets the eye.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
You Don't Know What You've Got Till It's...,"A lot of people might describe Gone Girl as a roller coaster ride. One of those movies that is in constant flux causing your stomach to tie up in knots. But it's really more of a maze. It's dark and brooding and sometimes it changes suddenly and unexpectedly, and sometimes we get lost, but the more lost we get the better. In the movie Amazing Amy Elliot Dunne has gone missing from her small town suburban Missouri home and the search to find her alive or dead begins a thrilling odyssey, where lives are ruined and each clue births a new mystery to be solved.But despite it's entertaining, ever shifting, half mystery half thriller angle, this is all just a cover for what the film is really about. The truth is, the only person we'll ever really know in our lives is ourselves. When we look into someone else's eyes there is no way of knowing what calculating clockwork might lay beyond. Even someone we love, someone we've grown up or grown old with, can become a total stranger. This is what the real heart of the movie is about: the ever changing masks we choose to wear. Because in truth we're all actors and we're always tailoring our performances to the audiences present. In the movie, Nick plays the part of the gallant boyfriend turned perfect husband, while Amy plays the part of the cool girlfriend turned wife.And after Amy disappears the focus becomes Nick's performance. How is he acting? Is he smiling at a time like this? Why doesn't he seem more concerned? His sister reminds him that he should look a little disheveled so that it appears he's had a long sleepless night while worrying for his lost wife. He's coached by lawyer Tanner Bolt to play the part of the f*ck up husband begging for forgiveness. All the while Amy plays the part of the abused housewife, the quintessential missing upper middle class white lady. And by the movie's end the characters will shed their old masks and don new ones, even more gruesome and terrifying than before. No one is really interested in the truth (except perhaps Nick, to a certain extent) and there is no justice. But how can there be justice in a world that is stained by the mainstream media and the Nancy Graces of the world, who act as judges of abstract character traits rather than anything concrete.Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike are quite honestly astounding in their performances. As the movie starts both actors seem to be wooden, robotic and inauthentic. But as the movie progresses we start to see the humans behind the facade, the true characters of Amy and Nick, if only for small fractions at a time before they sink back into their roles be it the witty writer, the poor woman from New Orleans, or the loving couple with a fresh start. And David Fincher is able to adeptly guide us along this labyrinth, keeping us on the edge of our seats and never challenging us to sit back and turn our brains off as the gears click. Aided by meticulous editing, beautiful silver coated cinematography and an often mellow, entrancing score, we're pulled into this dark saga that's less about finding the girl that's gone missing, but rather discovering the souls of these melancholy people trapped in some kind of awful twilight. But as Fincher takes us deeper into this mystery, as he uncovers mask after mask trying to reach something real we become resigned to the fact that we all have something to hide. It's not just Nick. There's a little bit of villain inside all of us, and we just have to keep covering it up, because god forbid anyone see us for what we truly are.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Twists your mind.,"Whenever I write these reviews on a movie I've just seen, I always get myself in the mood again by listening to the film's soundtrack as I write. As I sit here right now and the eerie sound of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross's score envelops me, I feel unlike myself. I feel not like a person I know. Not like a person at all. It's an unspeakable feeling, one that can only be put into words poorly as I have done. This sensation (which it is a sensation) is just a taste of what this entire movie does to you. Because this isn't a movie that you go and watch, this is a movie where you sit down and become Play-Dough in the hands of the filmmakers. And what they mold you into in the end - well, it's beyond description.""Gone Girl"" is about a wealthy middle-aged man named Nick Dunne, and his wife Amy. Nick returns home from visiting his sister Margo one day to find Amy missing, with signs of a struggle in the living room. Nick, along with Amy's incredibly wealthy parents, begin a search to find where she has disappeared to, as we slowly discover who is responsible for what has happened to Amy Dunne.""Gone Girl"" stars Ben Affleck as Nick and Rosamund Pike as Amy. I have never been fond of Affleck's acting ability and was no more impressed here. Affleck is a good filmmaker, his movies typically turn out well, but I always come away feeling he was the weak point, whether his role was behind or in front of the camera. Rosamund Pike on the other hand was outstanding in this film. Pike has had a bit of an interesting Hollywood story. It has always seemed she was one step away from stardom, but never quite in the spotlight. In my opinion, that is the perfect position for an actor to be in. She has the name to get those larger roles, but the unfamiliarity to get into those parts and make them significantly more believable. That scenario worked perfectly here, and the role of Amy is one of the best female performances I've seen all year. Making up the unlikely supporting cast are Neil Patrick Harris, Carri Coon, Missi Pyle, Kim Dickens, Emily Ratajkowski, and Tyler Perry.David Fincher is the main man responsible for this film, a director with quite a rap sheet. With credits like ""The Social Network,"" ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,"" ""Fight Club,"" and ""Se7en,"" it is easy to fathom that this is a film that messes with your mind. I have always had a little personal hate for movies of that kind, not because I think it somehow makes a bad movie, but just because I'm too proud to admit that I was so manipulated. And boy did that happen here. In this two and a half hour movie, I had my beliefs about these characters and the story and I could give concrete defenses for them. Fast forward ten minutes and I have completely flipped sides. After watching this movie, I am confident I would make a lousy politician.I still don't know how much I like this movie. I've always felt the best films are the ones that create strong characters who by the end of the two hours you know like your best friend. That didn't happen with this movie. The reason it didn't happen is because you were constantly being tricked into believing different things. I didn't like that, but it is undeniable that I completely fell for it. These filmmakers didn't make me believe what I wanted to believe, but they made me believe something. And then they took that, made me doubt it, and then made me believe something else. This film didn't fit the main quota that I'll give for a ""good movie,"" but that wasn't what they were trying to do. They were aiming for something completely different, and they succeeded perfectly.I always try to keep an open mind with movies, but I often fail. I am positive that there are a lot of people out there, and can even think of a few, who would love this movie. I didn't like the movie, but I loved that these filmmakers are so good at what they do. So as I walked out of the theater, I was wondering if the female worker who handed me my ticket was indeed female, or if David Fincher had tricked me into believing that too.I give ""Gone Girl"" an 8.0/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
good and thought provoking,"It is a well made and intelligent film for adults, bleak and pessimistic in its outlook on people, women in particular. Maybe it went too far in the depiction of a failed marriage and of two people who fail to live up to mutual expectations. There are countless marriages that do not work but usually people just divorce, they do not turn out to be cynical psychopaths, even if they hate each other. But then we would not have a best-selling book and a film. What I liked is that Fincher is not afraid to ask whether marriage is basically a trap for two people pressured by the society and religion to stay together at all costs. The film is rather mysogynistic, it dislikes people. The women come off as even worse than men, usually stronger and more manipulative. The only character which is pleasant and not dumb at the same time is the female detective. Her police partner is well meaning but dull and stupid, the lawyer played by Perry is smart but cynical. Nick's sister, played by the attractive Carrie Coon, would be nice if it weren't for the signs that she is in love with her brother (in a non-sisterly manner) and psychologically hung-up on him. The film also undermines the myth that a child is always a blessing for a marriage, here the child allows Amy to trap Nick in their unhappy and twisted marriage. The production values are high as in all Fincher films and Trent Reznor's music is excellent - minimalistic and not overbearing but always stressing the point.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Not classic Fincher, but still astounding.","David Fincher's resume is arguably one of the finest among those still working in Hollywood today. Se7en, Fight Club, The Social Network and Zodiac are all modern masterpieces; his latest, Gone Girl, is not in that league. Yet, like Panic Room, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, even second-tiered Fincher is fantastic. His direction here is more understated than usual, the Fincher trademarks – sudden outbursts of violence, grimly lingering camera movements, misleading shots – only becoming noticeable in the final act. He wisely allows Gillian Flynn's flip-flopping narrative enough room to breathe (Flynn's script changing direction from her own best selling novel which provides the source material), the multiple perspectives and hidden meanings ensuring you never know who to side with. It's not just plot twists and turns that keep you enthralled though, Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike are superb as the complicated married couple; their chemistry-turned- tension is scintillating. Affleck's career turnaround – after three astonishing directorial efforts plus impressive performances in The Town and Argo – is now complete, whilst this will hopefully be the role that finally propels Pike onto the A-list where she belongs. If there's a gripe to be had it's the final few minutes, with a downbeat and ambiguous finale not as satisfying as it could've been. But this is a minor quibble in what is otherwise a captivating, intriguing and beautifully complex motion picture.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

"Good thriller. Not a #250 Best,  but interesting nevertheless.","I'm always skeptical about movies that last more than 2 hours. If it's not a blockbuster kind of film, the chances are that it will be boring. I saw yesterday ""The equalizer"" with Denzel Washington (2:12 duration) and it was boring as hell.Surprisingly enough ""Gone Girl"" in its almost 2 and a half hours it's far from boring. I dare to say that it was really interesting until the end, and that says a lot.So if you want my quick recommendation: Go see it.I'm not a Ben Affleck fan but he is good in this. In my opinion he is no cut to play heroes. He is more like a regular Joe, with human weaknesses, so this role suits him. Rosamund Pike looks crazy enough, ""trapped in her own world"" so she's a good cast too. Same goes with the rest of the cast with the exception maybe of Neil Patrick Harris.The direction is not boring and keep you interested through its whole length. Some randomly added flashbacks help the narration, and are not confusing as in some other films.The atmosphere of the movie is great. It's a thriller that it can go both ways (and maybe even follow a ...third option).The music score is more like a music pad of electronic music (made by synthesizers and not an orchestra), and it is present all the time adding to the mystery.The movie it's not only about thrills. There is some substance too. About marriages, about expectations, about the world of electronic media, about how your public image can affect your life nowadays.Oh. And you get to see a glimpse of Affleck's ""average"" member (if you care, which I seriously doubt) in a shower scene, obviously made as a publicity stunt.Overall: Recommended as a good solid thriller. Good, but certainly not among the 100 best of all time, like IMDb rating suggests.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
twisty cold-hearted thriller,"In small town Missouri, upper class Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) reports his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) missing on their 5th wedding anniversary. Detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) investigates and notices some oddities right away. He doesn't seem to know much about her life including a friendship with neighbor Noelle Hawthorne (Casey Wilson). She was a successful children's book author in NYC. He moved home to care for his terminal mother and later his delusional father. The couple's money is mostly her's. The bar he co-owns with his twin sister Margo Dunne (Carrie Coon) was actually paid by his wife. He lost his college teaching job. She hates that he is a sloth and her money is draining away. TV personality Ellen Abbott (Missi Pyle) makes a meal of his presumed guilt. However the case gets more twisted. Desi Collings (Neil Patrick Harris) is Amy's stalker. Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry) is famed defense lawyer. Andie Fitzgerald (Emily Ratajkowski) is Nick's young mistress.This is a great demented brilliant Lifetime movie on steroids. It's twisty and cold-hearted. The acting is superb headed by Rosamund Pike and Carrie Coon. Ben Affleck is a solid lead. The directing is relentlessly compelling. This is not to say I have no problems with the movie. I never once believed Nick killed his wife and therefore the twist is not that shocking. I choose to believe that David Fincher did not make Nick look guilty because he didn't want it to be manufactured. Nevertheless the whole story does have a manufactured feel like Amy's disturbed scheme. I also couldn't see past Neil Patrick Harris or Tyler Perry. NPH doesn't give off the creeps that his character needs desperately. Tyler Perry is Tyler Perry and I can't see his character without his Tyler Perry persona. The best moment actually comes when Amy gets robbed by the couple. That is a shocking brilliant reversal which caught me by surprise. The last half is deliciously cold. The movie ends a bit early but it's already over 2 hours long. Modern movie don't usually go far longer than that and it's set up for an interesting sequel.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Humanity,"I just watched Gone Girl!!! It seems talking about a possessive girl. But when you look closer to the act, you would observe her insecurity from loneliness and being stereotyped as a good girl as Amazing Amy. As she has been forced to be someone she isn't, she keeps her reputation by libeling men and tries to have more personal space by threatening them. Being polite, kind and nice to people, getting married, having children, and bringing up children.....These all are the female figure in most countries. She can't escape from the media, because she is the girl in the novel, so she chooses to have the freedom in this limitation. She is a murder of her husband's freedom, but she is also murdered by the stereotype of women in society. I love the movie=]'' It's a typical theme with a bloody, rational expression.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Speechless,"I'm not going to give any clues to the plot, this film needs to be seen without knowing the end. It's very rare that the entire audience remains silent and seated when the lights go up. Brilliantly acted - Ben Afleck and Rosamund Pike were superb, they played 2 very complex characters incredibly well. I found it very hard to feel biased towards either of the main characters, which I think was intended. The film is very pared down in how it was shot which enabled the viewer to completely concentrate on the characters. There were admittedly some parts which were less believable, but they didn't take away from the overall enjoyment. I need to see this again and again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

David Fincher doesn't disappoint again,"David Fincher has his own style and never disappoints me and that goes for this film as well. It all starts off innocently enough, but after a while it becomes a mystery and by the second half it was getting pretty damn interesting for me and I was very interested to see how it would end. I was really pleasantly surprised. It was building up nicely and it was unpredictable for me and I didn't expect it to turn out the way it did. An interesting and at times breathtaking piece of work. For me, a great film that I recommend, especially if you've seen anything by this director and like his mystery flair.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Oh. My. God!,"I thought that I was going to like the movie but didn't expect to love it that much! How could I live without watching such a masterpiece?I used to like Ben Affleck, but now I don't just like him no, he's one of my favorite actors from now on.On the other hand, Rosamund Pike did very well performing her side of the movie. Writing, directing, soundtracks, etc... Nothing in the movie wasn't perfectly presented.Now this is how crime movies should be presented. This is what those stupid producers should spend their money on. Not like most of these days movies which give us nothing useful to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
The unreliable narrator,"This lurid tale told from an unreliable narrator, has a solid 'did he? didn't he' hook - a man's wife goes missing and he becomes the target of public scrutiny when he becomes the prime suspect. Fincher classes up this trashy story and it's both a strength and a weakness, as he wisely never lets this become over the top sordid garbage, but also never allows this to be as fun when it wallows in its sleazy storytelling. Even still, the story is so emotionally cold and misanthropic, that there's fun aplenty from how twisted and mean Gone Girl becomes. Ben Affleck does good work, under playing his role, while convincingly carrying the weight of the stress of his bizarre situation. Tyler Perry's dialogue delivery as a high priced lawyer is sharp and witty and pulled off with his stunt casting. Rosamund Pike plays our Gone Girl who you will most likely not forget for quite some time. Gone Girl is a clever film, with an ending that falls a little too easily into place, but it's always entertaining and definitely worth recommending.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

The damn ending...,"OK, so there I am watching this movie, heavily engrossed in the story and loving it for the most part. Then the film did something really cool towards the third act of the film. I had no idea how this was going to end, and neither did the writers apparently...When this drama has been building up for nearly two and a half hours, you'd almost think that it would be impossible for the films ending to be bad. I was ready to accept whatever it was that was shown on screen before the end credits, however, the film doesn't end (in terms of the story). It leaves you sitting there with an underwhelming feeling. I get that there is supposed to be an underlying message behind it but it doesn't work for what Fincher set out to do. When you have all this build up throughout the film, its hard not to be disappointed with a film just cutting off without resolving anything.It's really hard to give a rating for this film as I loved all of it, apart from the last minute, literally. Just before the film finished, I was thinking to myself; ""what would I rate the the film out of 10?"" And I could only think to give it an 8 or above, but then the ending happened, the damn ending! 5/10.I'm not blaming David Fincher for this, the book its adapted from is obviously the culprit but I would still advise people to see it. Maybe others will love the ending. Having said all that, I did enjoy the vast majority of the film so I cant complain too much, its just a shame as it could have been so so much better, had it ended properly.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Well, we have our first clue.","There is nothing more exiting than a plot twist in the middle of a movie. But what if it shifts emphasis on it as a key element? A variety of elements are going to be necessary in order for this to work. First, a Gillian Flynn's bestseller book and a screenplay written by herself will be needed. And second, a changeable director capable of adapting to different script situations. Due to his constant changes in filmmaking techniques, David Fincher proved to be the ideal leader to direct this project.When the world of filmmaking opened its gates to me, one of the first rules I was taught was that music should not be included throughout the film, because it could affect the quality of performance of the actors. After seeing Gone Girl and David Fincher, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross in action, I believe that such theory could not be more wrong. The original score of the plot twisted thriller Gone Girl is one of the main attraction in this film, owing to its usage across almost every scene. This particular technique helped to keep the audience attention over the entire film. (In contrast to his movie SE7EN, where many scenes without music can be found). After watching the movie you will feel tempted to download the entire soundtrack. (""Like Home"" highly recommended).Other particular element spotted here was the improved performance of Ben Affleck and refined style of Rosamund Pike. The first one left his cocky pretentious acting style aside in order to achieve a pragmatic human character, while the second one provided us a variety of accents that could fairly be described as convincing.An old technique in the acting world says ""If you want to look like a psycho, don't blink and stare at the others"". No doubt this method worked for Rosamund, but what she did was absolutely well prepared, adding head movements and staring at the precise moment. Although she was not awarded for best actress in the Golden Globes awards, I consider her performance as the best of the season.Gone Girl combines both daily life and fictitious events to give birth to a sick, brilliant and addictive film, where you can easily identify yourself with any character (Or want to be as one of them). Cheers to everyone, especially to David Fincher, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, and of course to Gillian Flynn, the first step towards achieving a successful film is having an exceptional screenplay.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Top Fincher movie,"Like usual fincher doesn't disappoint. His use of tension is amazing and used in the perfect spots; I've never felt so much dread, not even most horror movies leave me with my mouth wide open. It took a bit of time to warm up to the first half of the film and I found the editing fades to the flashbacks a bit clunky. Wether it was intentional or not, I soon got over it and was fully hooked after the mid point. The immaculate detail of characters and a play on who to trust and root for was amazing. Precision of the ending should feel unsatisfied but it's not, more on the contrary. This overall was a worth while watch, minus an odd choice of editing in the beginning.

This movie is a masterpiece and absolute must see,"Gone Girl (2014) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently watched on Tubi.

Did he do the deed or was he possibly set up by his wife?This movie was directed by David Fincher (Se7en) and stars Ben Affleck (Mall Rats), Rosamund Pike (Die Another Day), Neil Patrick Harris (Starship Troopers), Tyler Perry (Diary of a Mad Black Woman), Missi Pyle (Galaxy Quest) and Kim Dickens (Deadwood).The storyline for this picture is very thorough, well written and creative. This movie contains fantastic characters, circumstances and pacing. The plot unravels meticulously and methodically. The cast is awesome and Affleck and Pike are brilliant.

Near perfect.,"There are so so many reviews about this movie already.But I want to highlight someone who comes short in my opinion.Ben Affleck.If you really look into it, you'll eventually see just how brilliant this portrayal is.A lot of people don't credit him well acting-wise.And maybe he really can only play one type of character? But so what. If it fits as hammer-on-the-nail as it does in 'Gone Girl', I'll happily watch more.The best thing is the dynamic between the two leads.Hate, resentment, but a soft spot for each other nevertheless. It's so much better since it's made believable that initially it started out well. That it wasn't doomed from the start.The ending is great.PS: However adores Amy Dunne or justifies her behaviour should seek therapy. The character is wonderfully written. Rosamund Pike is phenomenal. But ""liking"" the character herself? As inn ""You go, girl!""? You should put a restraining order on yourself.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Sickening But Compulsive,"This review is going into a large traffic of reviews so my humble offering will probably go unread. As a writer who has a smallish following of readers I am used to this, and this is why I prefer to give non mainstream films preference, which includes a large amount of semi-ignored LGBTQ film, older films that have sadly passed over the horizon of time or quirky shorts that get lost in the forest of what we call film. This film I did not even know was directed by David Fincher until I found a slimline copy of it somehow lost in my collection. I hate the title. It is a come and grab me title and I do not want to be grabbed. A lot of Fincher's work have similar pushy approaches; ' Seven ', ' Panic Room ', ' The Social Network ,' and of course ' Fight Club '. The latter has for me an overtly Gay feel about it , and the content of that scenario can easily have a Gay interpretation. And now ' Gone Girl ' which seems the darkest, most pessimistic of the lot. The message I took away from it was that we can trust no one or know what twists of perversion and horror they are going to inflict upon us; neither should we trust our own for hell is truly within and can destroy our sanity in the process of destroying others. I noticed too that one reviewer had said it had propelled his own marriage to a divorce. I believed him and this appals me, but such is the strength and power of Fincher's best work, and this is an excellent film. But do I like it ? No. There is a murder scene that is sickening to watch and after the film's semi-long running time I felt numb. Fincher has a vision of darkness and often claustrophobic savagery and he convincingly draws you in. During watching ' Panic Room ' in an Amsterdam Cinema a large rat literally ran over my body in the darkness. I took that as a sign that Fincher is dangerous, but then quite a few of our best directors (usually of the past ) are. But to return to ' Gone Girl ' it twists like a snake, and even dead wood Ben Affleck gave a superb performance, but it is Rosamond Pike's extraordinary acting that sucked me into the whirlpool. To sum up - see it at your peril, and see it alone for it is ultimately about aloneness and what the world conveniently calls evil. It is a vision too terrible to share with anybody or be responsible for them to see it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Jaw-dropping twists around every corner.,"There isn't a lot that hasn't already been said about David Fincher's latest murder-mystery Gone Girl. It only took the opening weekend for film reviews everywhere to be saturated with the buzzwords that are most certainly applicable to the film's effect and atmosphere, but not necessarily worthy of hyperbole. I haven't read Gillian Flynn's novel, I bought it a long time ago but haven't gotten round to it. I know want to read it just to get under the character's skin a little more. The film excels when its getting under the characters but moreso when it's pure chaos. It has a lot of interesting gender politics about the representation of men and women in the media, especially under rose-tinted or poo-tinted lenses. Although Fincher's portrayal of the media are quite cartoonish - especially with Missi Pyle who plays it like she would in a more radiant comedy - the absurdism is part of what the film has to say.It's disturbingly accurate too; straight after coming out from the cinema, the news in our car reports on a missing girl. But it's not just a zeitgeist, the dissection of marriage and the projections that we put on each other are studied with a heated laser pointer. It's all about the masks we wear and our subsequent breaking points. There are few scenes more compelling than the unraveling ""Cool Girl"" montage, perhaps one of the finest moments of Fincher's oeuvre thus far. It's a shame that it's more or less the peak. Not to say the rest of the film doesn't have its moments, it does, but I did find much of the framing of it frustrating, mostly regarding the way the narrative stops and starts around news reports. Its opening act is pretty mild. There's an odd approach to the film where things feel a little off. Performances outside of our leads are overly rigid, outside of a strong featured supporting cast with Kim Dickens, Carrie Coon, Tyler Perry and Scoot McNairy bringing a fleeting Argo reunion.Ben Affleck however, plays it loose and grounded. It's been noted that he's an ideal lead for the film, not only because you can like and dislike him simultaneously but because he's experienced public scrutiny like Nick Dunne has. Rosamund Pike is confident, elegant, calculating and cold. She truly makes you believe in the darkness of Amy Dunne but also the beacon that endears everyone to her. Fincher does a great job of balancing out the way we feel about the two of them, tipping the scales for and against at every turn. I am less enamoured with the way the film treats its third act, especially upon reflection. There feels like far too many liberties and oversights, unresolved moments prior awaiting payoff. It's in the nature of films like this, particularly Zodiac where paths are abandoned. But it also suffers a similar problem as The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo where the end rushes to the finish line without digging back under the character's skin for one last look.The score contributes a lot to this distance, great elsewhere but misplaced here. However, this doesn't drag the film down, it mostly confirmed the way I felt about it the whole time. The editing and cinematography are pretty terrific, but relatively understated for his work, but in a positive way that doesn't interfere with the story. Fincher has been made a big deal out of recently for his meticulous nature, and I agree, The Social Network demonstrates his ability remarkably especially lately. Perhaps I had my expectations for his work too high but I just found Gone Girl a little clumsy at times. Maybe I scrutinised it too hard, the way people scrutinise Nick. I just feel like Fincher is holding himself to a lower standard than he has the potential for. Anyway, it's a very good thriller with some jaw-dropping moments, not quite the great one people want to call it now but it certainly has a lot to say.7/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Just great,"Maybe I'm overreacting but I really mean it. This movie was great in every way possible. Usually when people talk about this movie they go on about the plot of the story and even though it came as a surprise, there are other ways of talking about this movie.First half is pretty basic story vise, main character finds his home violated and his wife missing. In that first half we get two view points, view-point of main protagonist Nick and the detective investigating this case. So as the detective is going deeper into the case, reading chapters from missing Amy's journal, we start suspecting Nick more and more but one can easily see that something is wrong about that picture which is presented to us. And that's as much of the plot that you're gonna get from me.Everyone was doing his/hers job perfectly, not attracting attention to their work. The score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross was perfect, for most of the running time i didn't really notice it that much, you'd notice it at just the right moments for just the good amount. Where a lot of people would try to use music to manipulate your mood. This was atmospheric at just the right amount.Camera movement/angles are perfect, again a lot of people try to be showoffy with the camera moves/long takes/weird angles, but here everything serves only a story telling purpose. Like most of Finchers films, you could turn off the audio and still get what is going on because it's perfectly orchestrated. Also, the color palate is very fitting given the overall theme of the movie.Performances range from good to GREAT.Ben Affleck has been in some really good movies over the years but his acting chops were never exceptional. Here he shines like never before, and maybe it's because the role just fits him personally. For good amount of the time he plays a man who's imploding, with only few bursts of anger. Even though we, the audiences, were manipulated to hate him in the first half I kind of liked the guy, but will be the first one to say that he's an A-hole. A lot of people didn't like him but to me he's just your normal guy who you can find in your neighborhood. Given the overall them of the movie I'd say that pretty much all of his actions are right fitting and that most of the people judging him would probably act the same way (since I don't want to go into spoilers, I will leave it at this).Rosamund Pike is THE STAR of this film, giving the performance of her career and I would be disappointed if there isn't a lot of Oscar buzz around it (but I also wouldn't be surprised if they ignore it because the Academy was never about honoring the very best). A lot of people are judging her character and her motivations for some of her choices but one thing that people tend to forget is that movies are not the exact representation of life,they're the illusion of reality. And also, we're taking about a sick mind that doesn't have a real 'I' because all of the media scrutiny she was exposed to. So her perception of morally right and wrong is different from everyone else's. But I can get people not buying into character motivations.This is going over the edge and then some in sole purpose of making us learn something about our selves, in this case about how we're only mammals who are for majority of the time just an echo... How we're all putting on masks of what we find is the perfect self, and what happens when you get into route and start taking things for granted... But also giving a great commentary on mass media and again proving the point that people as a mass group are stupid, panicky animals. Given this theme the movies ending and choices characters made are perfectly fitting and is only logical. I haven't read the book, and I don't really want to because this did the job for me and the author wrote the screenplay so I know it's what was intended in the first place.It's also worth noting Neil Patrick Harris's and Tyler Perry's performances too, but I wouldn't say they're anything other than good.If there is a misstep it's that only after the twist happened, the detective started raising some questions as far as the Nick's innocence or the lack of it, there was no indication of it before. But she was judgmental from the very beginning about everything so I'll let it slide.And in one of the sex scenes, which was very disturbing to say the least, penetration happened while Pike still had he underwear on... And yet few scenes later we get a way more exposing shoot of her in the bathtub. This movie was obviously not interested in censoring stuff so why? I guess MPAA would've slapped it with an NC-17, so I guess this is for the better, I was surprised to get this much into just an R and be so commercial. I'm loving that Fincher is getting this much attention and that a quality film making is third week at the top of the box office figures. Go see it, now!",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Gone Girl is Oscar worthy,"Gone Girl is Oscar worthy. It was a thriller throughout. It was just a great movie. If you like thrillers then you will love Gone Girl. Gone Girl has been the best movie I have seen all year so far. It is one of those movies where if you don't pay attention to it you will not understand what is going on next.Gone Girl is a movie that everyone will want to go see. Now parents this movie is rated R for strong sexual content and some other stuff, but it is very good. I recommend this movie for anyone who liked the book. It is one amazing movie.

Sloppy movie,"First the good things about the movie. The acting is good. The production values are high and it's well directed. All in all, it's also well cast, but the story line? Oy ve. Take a stupid pill before you see this movie. It's the only way you will get through it and find the plot plausible. Let me give you two examples. A woman gets injured so severely that she looses a quart of blood and has no wounds. At one point she enters the emergency room coated in drying blood and leaves in scrubs but still has the dried blood all over her. That's some sloppy hospital. This is some sloppy movie. I would wait until it's released on DVD. Perhaps then the director can explain the plot.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Do we really fully know anyone?,"Fincher is back after a three year hiatus since 'Girl With a Dragon Tattoo' and for me the wait was worth it. This time around he has adapted Gillian Flynn's 2012 novel of the same name (which I haven't read) and from all reports the movie sticks pretty close to the novel - probably due to the fact that Flynn herself wrote the screenplay.The film follows the once loved up couple of Amy (Rosamund Pike) and Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) who both lost their jobs in a recent recession and have had to move back to his hometown, where, using Amy's money Nick owns and runs a bar with his twin sister Margo (Carrie Coon). It is their fifth wedding anniversary and it is fair to say this is one relationship that has come to end of the road. After a call from a friendly neighbour about his cat (which he shows more affection to than his wife), Nick returns home and discovers that something is a miss - namely Amy is missing.The rest of the movie revolves around the 'media' witch hunt surrounding number one suspect Nick and Nick's quest to clear his name. Detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) does her best to crack the case while Nick himself has the help of well known lawyer Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry).The two and half hour run time seemed to fly by and the film doesn't quite follow the same path as most thrillers with some unexpected twists and turns, which is always pleasing to see, and an ending that may disappoint some cinema goers, but from what I understand stays pretty true to the book.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Was a 9 or 10 til the credits rolled,"This movie was fantastic. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time, until the credits rolled and it just ended out of nowhere. The ending was not satisfying and was trying to do the whole ""leave it to your imagination"" thing. I was not a fan of that. Other than the poor ending I would say the movie itself was super engaging, and a great watch. Although I'll probably never watch it again now that I know how it ends. It's one of THOSE movies. You probably know what I'm talking about. Affleck was fantastic, and so was the lead detective. I assume the book ended this way as well, that's the only explanation as to why it left the bitter taste in my mouth that it did.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A chilling and highly contemporary thriller,"David Fincher is rightly regarded as a darling of modern cinema, and he continues this with his fantastic adaptation of Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl. The novel was a best seller for months, and a piercing look at relationships in the 21st century, and the troubles of marriage. Of course, it does this with larger than life characters and a twist filled dark mystery, but its commentary is notable.Gone Girl focuses on the disappearance of Rosemund Pike's Amy Dunne, wife of the Prime Suspect Nick Dunne, played by Ben Affleck. The potential kidnapping/murder is interspersed with flashbacks to the formation of their happy relationship, and its slow breakdown via Amy's diary entries. To say much more about the plot would be to spoil a modern soon-to-be classic of the genre, and it's certainly a film that benefits from the viewer knowing as little as possible.With such a necessary limit on discussion of the plot specifics, one can suffice to say that the orderly becomes disorderly, nothing is as it seems, and the progress of the film, particularly its third act, is unexpected. But along the way the film takes aim at much of societies more recent ills. The media frenzy, the 'expert opinions', the social lynching, are all shown to be superficial and contradictory. Yet, they are also acknowledged as powerful and damning. The criticism of falsehood is less aimed at the media, and more of its followers.Indeed, falsehood is arguably the central theme of the film, and no more so does it tackle this than in relationships. Nick and Amy's relationship over the course of the two and a half hours of the film is put under our intense scrutiny, and they acknowledge the inherent falsehoods that were intentionally present. Along the way there are legitimate criticisms, such as the aspiration of the so-called 'cool girl' male desire. The criticisms strike at society today, and once again Fincher has captured an aspect of society in a time capsule. Relationships in the early 21st century are accurately captured here, albeit occasionally taken to their extremes.In terms of the cast, this is a a film that focuses on its leads, and Ben Afflect delivers one of his best performances here, ironically placed in a character who struggles to portray genuine emotions. Rosamund Pike however steals the show as Amy, an ex-writer who is buried under an inferiority to her parent's fictionalised version of herself (in children's books called 'Amazing Amy'). The supporting cast is impressive, including a truly creepy turn from Neil Patrick Harris, and Carrie Coon as Nick's rock of a twin sister.The film's screenplay is penned by the novel's author, and while I haven't read the novel, most accounts are that it is an excellent adaption. The script is where most of the ideas really shine, and it crafts somewhere between a thriller teetering on a constant knife edge and one of the blackest comedies in recent memory. Certainly there was a surprising amount of laughter in the cinema.David Fincher is once again a commanding presence behind the screen, and in that sense it's similar to his previous work. It's dark, it's brooding, and it tackles contemporary society (see The Social Network, Fight Club). Fincher often appears at his most comfortable in the thriller territory, and Gone Girl is no exception. Once again the score by Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross, making their third film collaboration, and the music's sense of false happiness is true to the film.The film definitely has the flavour of Fincher's later, more sophisticated nuance- as in Zodiac & The Social Network- rather than the rampant kinetic excess of earlier films (e.g. Se7en, Fight Club). If one must criticise, the end segment winds down awkwardly, and by comparison the film fails to capture the dialogue or tension of some of Fincher's previous work.It is unlikely that this is Fincher's best, though that's partly because of his consistent high quality. This is a director whose generally worst regarded film of the last decade was an Academy Award darling. Gone Girl is a masterful film that proves his quality.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Marriage Material!,"I'd started reading Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl a few months back and a few chapters in, I thought to myself ""Know what? I'd give Fincher a chance with this one and then I'll finish reading!"" Since then I'd been patiently waiting for Gone Girl's release. I was excited what with Fincher being one of my favorite directors. The previews didn't tell much but still had that eerie touch to it that kept me waiting. Finally, yesterday I got to watch Gone Girl and without further ado I'd like to add that it was without doubt one of the best movies I'd seen this year.Nick Dunne and Amy Dunne, upon losing their jobs and going bankrupt, relocates to Missouri and on the morning of their 5th anniversary, Amy goes missing. Investigation ensues and all eyes, including the media's, rests upon Nick who has no clue what happened to Amy. As the movie progresses all odds are against Nick and it becomes a crime drama thriller, a whodunnit putting all suspicion on Nick. Has he killed her or not? Nick also unravels some stuff about his wife. Gone Girl goes back and forth from the investigation and the media circus to flashback scenes where Amy narrates her fears about being with her husband. What's pretty obvious is that the victim is not who you think she is and throughout the movie you are trying to find out what's off with the whole scenario and at times you will find yourself perplexed as to who you should be rooting for, Nick or Amy.I have always adored David Fincher's movies be it the ill-received Alien 3 or Se7en. Of course most of the his films are adapted from original source materials but on celluloid he does know how to deliver an intellectually supreme thriller. David Fincher plays all the cards right here and Gone Girl makes for an immersive, tense and compelling crime drama thriller. You yourself adorn the detective's cape and try to figure things for yourself but Fincher makes sure that you don't reach the conclusion that easily as he constantly throws twists and turns at you that glues you to your seats.There's not one performance that could be looked down upon and along with Fincher's solid direction it all comes to a fine full circle. I remember seeing Rosamund Pike as a ravishing bond girl in Die Another Day and in many more mediocre roles from Doom to Wrath Of The Titans etc. Who would have thought she would deliver a performance that makes you go all dumbfounded. She went from vulnerable to intimidating to manipulative to sheer conniving. I'd say the best part about Gone Girl would be her. I'll just put this here, I am not a Ben Affleck fan and I was one among the many who cringed at the news that he was going to be the next Batman. I love his direction, I love his writing but I just don't like to see him screen. But its time to put all that out of the way. Affleck is solid here and gives one of his career-best performances and I am one step closer to tolerate seeing him on screen. Carrie Coon plays Margo, Nick's twin sister and she was adorably cute and her scenes with her brother were some of the best ones. Supporting cast also includes Tyler Perry, a celebrity lawyer who charges his clients a $100,000 as retainer fee and he does his part just fine. I am not used to watching Tyler Perry movies (thanks Madea), but some of the jovial moments were well done. Initially, I thought Neil Patrick Harris was an odd choice for a David Fincher movie but he gave an impeccable performance as well. Media also plays a major role in the movie and it almost plays like a character even manipulating you at times.Gone Girl is beautifully shot. It looked as if the whole of Missouri looked mourning in Amy's missing and it takes a more warm tone during the films third act. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross's score is indeed an icing on the cake goes perfectly sync with the spellbinding visuals. Fincher's own The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was banned in India due to its graphic rape scene and I was skeptic if Gone Girl, with its domestic violence scenes, would walk down the same alley. I thank the censor board for being sensible and not doing so and also zooming in on the non nude parts than chopping off entire scenes made much more sense.Mark my words, this movie is gonna test your bladders and you will feel like keeping it in so do go for this movie with an empty bladder and don't even think of that maxi size Pepsi at the counter. You wouldn't want to miss anything. Its close to 3 hours and the only times I looked at my watch was due to my impatient bladder than due to getting bored. Its that much engrossing.Gone Girl is a bit about marriage and what all can go worse in a marriage. Its a bit superficial, yes, but Fincher grounds the movie in a believable reality that it doesn't really matter. This isn't Finchers Magnum opus in fact it doesn't even come close to it, ie Fight Club. Nonetheless he manages to build a cohesive and immensely immersive Crime Drama that plays with your wits till end. Can't recommend this more!",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
8.5/10,"Tense from frame one and always unpredictable, this film is the living proof of David Fincher's mastery at directing, as he takes us through this journey with utter confidence.I had a great experience with this movie, it was really amazingly entertaining and scary at the same time to see how the events unfolded, but most importantly I wanted to see how they went down. I was on the edge of my seat for the whole duration because I simply could not wait to know how things would go down. As I was watching it, I realized simply how good David Fincher is. When the police enter Nick's house for the first time there is a scene where they start discussing particulars and it was stunning to see how Fincher managed to create tension in that situation with just a few details. By the way, performances across the board are great. Even Tyler Perry is great! I have been a big critic of Ben Afleck as an actor in the past, but here he gives what might be the best performance of his career, he plays the part perfectly and the point that proves it is the fact that you don't notice it. What can I say of Rosamund Pike's performance that hasn't been said before? She totally transforms and the by the end of the movie I was creep-ed and terrified by just her face, great work! Fincher is one of my favourite directors, I love every one of his movies and even like Alien3. But, with the exception of Zodiac, which is his favourite of mine, I have never jumped up and down for his movies, I really love them but they just don't make it up to a 9 for me. I can't put my finger on why, but I'll just say that they don't make me leave the theater shaking.I still love this movie as much as all of his others, it is a clear fit in his filmography and I recommend for everyone to see it and have a blast at watching perfect filmaking.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Magnificent Thriller!,"Gone Girl is a very dark suspenseful film. It has all of the elements of a mystery story. However, this film has a major twist. When the twist happens the film switches lanes completely. The movie is almost two and a half hours long, but that doesn't even begin to capture everything. The movie was brilliantly written and directed. From the cast to the acting to the camera angles; this movie is sheer perfection. When I first watch the movie, I felt like time flew by, and nonetheless I was left wanting more... but that's an awesome thing. The movie is slow moving for the first 20 minutes so you just have to be patient but it becomes extremely fast incredibly quickly and the pace is so fast you'll have to keep up. (No bathroom breaks!) I truly believe that this movie deserves for the audience, for someone to really enjoy it, to watch it at least 2 or 3 times. If you watch this movie over and over, then you'll notice things that you didn't know were there the previous times you'd watched it. This movie is intense yet haunting. I feel like the music really creates the suspenseful image, also; it worked extremely well with the plot and acts being played out on screen. The performances in this movie are outstanding. I feel like Ben Affleck is mysterious and lustful and plays the part perfectly. I also feel that all of the other actors in the film went well above their standards. Rosamund Pike absolutely knocks it out of the ballpark. I'm ecstatic that Pike is nominated for a Academy Award. In my personal opinion, Rosamund Pike, well there's no other way to put it other than she plays an upstanding psychotic woman. This is Rosamund Pike's big break. I hope she continues with her acting career and the acting skills she portrayed in Gone Girl. The movie is full of twists and turns and I don't think you truly see what's headed your way. This isn't your typical mystery movie. This is not your average suspenseful thriller. This is by far director David Fincher's best work. If you really want entertainment, if you want to be on the edge, and if you really want to watch a film that is completely unpredictable, then I HIGHLY recommend Gone Girl for anyone who likes to be surprised.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Gone Girl is a dark and cynical thriller that throws a wicked spin into the bells and whistles of modern-day marriage.,"Deliciously dark and wickedly funny, Gone Girl is a multi-layered potboiler that is every bit entertaining and compelling as it is disturbing and shocking. As both a crime drama and psychological thriller, nothing can prepare you for the whiplashing twists and turns that propels the story towards a rewarding and explosive finale, followed by ebbing shockwaves that will leave you in afterthought even after the end credits.While there are several avenues of praise for this well-made crime caper, top credit goes to director David Fincher for what has to be his finest hour in the art of macabre storytelling. Adapted for the screen by Gillian Flynn's novel of the same name, a large part of that art stems from the systematic crafting of a story that is intended to deceive the audience into thinking exactly what the narrator wants you to think. Perception, derived from illusion, forms the backbone of this story, including how we first relate to lead characters Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) and his beautiful wife Amy Elliott-Dunne (Rosamund Pike). They live in Missouri after losing their jobs as writers in recession hit New York City. On the morning of their fifth wedding anniversary, Nick returns home from a bar he co-owns with twin sister Margo (Carrie Coon) only to find a shattered coffee table and his wife missing. First on the scene is Detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) who doesn't find Nick's answers very convincing. In fact, the more Nick is scrutinized the more he appears to be hiding something and within hours the media and Amy's friends and relatives are out for his blood. With Amy's disappearance becoming headline news, speculation rises and Nick becomes the prime suspect. Making matters worse, Nick doesn't appear to be worried about his wife's disappearance either.Readers of the book will be happy to note that Flynn has also scripted the screenplay. In the wrong hands this film could have turned out pointless and vague – an undesirable yet unforeseeable byproduct of author-director mismatch. With Gone Girl, it's hard to poke fun or fault when the screenplay is adapted by the same person who wrote the source material. If anything, the script is fine tuned for the screen and matched only by the skill of the director, who just happens to be master twister Fincher himself. It's a perfect writer-director union as Fincher is not new to manipulating the audience into believing what they are seeing. That being said, the key words here are 'union' and 'manipulation', which turns out to be the flesh and blood of the story. On the outer layer this film might seem like a whodunit murder mystery, but at the core it is a comically dark social commentary about love and hate and the thin line in between. Before bringing that pot to a boil, Fincher employs a linear narration by allowing the mystery to unravel in real time alongside flashbacks that show how perfect Nick and Amy are when they first meet, to just how incompatible they become before the latter goes missing. Then there's the manipulation. It's not just about the Dunnes or spouse versus spouse or the disintegration of marriage as a spiritual institution. By the time we get into the thick of it, Flynn's commentary manifests into a trudging dark horse tethered to the manipulation of truth and justice, before galloping towards a pound-for-pound revenge finale.Despite clocking at just under 150 minutes, this is a film not to be missed. Even with an absorbing story and the director's skill in telling that story, Gone Girl wouldn't have turned out half as good as it is without the stellar performances of all involved, including supporting roles from Tyler Perry as Nick's defense lawyer and Neil Patrick Harris as Amy's creepy ex-boyfriend. But come awards season 2015, Gone Girl could be in the spotlight for no other reason than Pike's sensational role that illustrates the idiom 'Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned'. That alone should have a majority of viewers echoing the sentiment – W.T.F!",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
an incredible roller-coaster of suspense and thrill that leaves you begging for more,"Once again David Fincher has nailed his talent as a director. Through Gone Girl he has set himself a level apart.

Tyler perry is also great though he could have had more screen space. I didn't quite get the role of Neil Patrick Harris but still doesn't get in the way of the experience.

no one said that relationships are going to be easy,"It should be clear that no person can truly know any other person. Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"" dealt with this issue: the main character starts to suspect his neighbor of foul play. David Fincher's ""Gone Girl"" takes it one step further, focusing on a married couple. On the surface, the movie looks at the wife's disappearance and reveals the wife's unseemly side. But the sensationalist media's targeting of the husband is an equally important part of the story. The look at the secrets that people hide, combined with the look at sensationalism, amounts to an impressive movie.Ben Affleck puts on a good performance, but this is Rosamund Pike's movie all the way. Her performance as the manipulative wife earned her an Academy Award nomination. I haven't seen any of the other movies nominated in that category, so I can't determine if this was the best performance, but it's certainly up there. Among the other cast members, even Neil Patrick Harris - who just hosted the Oscars - puts on a serious performance. I recommend the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Gone girl is actually good???,"That's pretty much what 99% of movie buffs will wonder when they see the meta score on imdb for this thriller. It's actually decent, maybe even good?Well, it really depends on where you're coming from - if you're a finsher fan, and you were expecting something on par with the amazing, genre-busting fight club, I have bad news: this is a well constructed thriller but nothing special. A particularly long VO exposition sequence mid-movie seriously ruins this film chances at greatness.On the plus side, if you need something to keep yourself distracted on a rainy saturday, this isn't bad at all.The problem really is that the characters are paper thin, especially the wife, and I'm told that this is a major shift away from the complexity and subtlety of the book it's adapted from. Everything that happens in the movie is telegraphed 15 minutes ahead. Everything.Some have said the movie is a critique of feminism - nonsense. The movie is a critique of media circuses and mob mentality. But while it maintains a nice balance in the form of Afflek's character flaws, it doesn't offer the same when it comes to his wife.Performances are fairly subpar by the way - at some point one character jokes they feel like in a 'law and order' episode and well, not sure if it was intended to be so meta , but it hits the nail right on the head.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"A taut, nuanced psychological thriller which demands the audience play detective.","I'm going to start by saying, I absolutely love how this movie is polarising people. Just browsing IMDb quickly you get a sense that people either love it and totally understood the tone, or hate it and understood some of the tone but maybe not all. In my opinion of course. This is often the sign of a great film, better to be loved or hated than merely tolerated.I got it. I really really enjoyed this. I watched it due to there being a fairly poor selection of other movies to stack it against that were showing in my area, and going in with no assumptions or expectations I was nearly blown away, and about halfway through realised it might be one of those movies I watch several times throughout the course of my life.It's a lot of a things - another strong psychological study of sociopathy, a fairly well aimed critique of the tarnished sanctity of marriage (translation: marriage in this day and age is kind of a BS idea), an excellent use of the unreliable narrator plot device and in my opinion Fincher's best film since Fight Club. Yes, there are a few contrived coincidences and moments where the reality is heightened and stretched, but just remember - what if it's the character's recollection that has done this? Adds another level to the film and aids suspension of disbelief - it's the CHARACTER's bad storytelling, the film is intelligent and self-aware enough to allow this.Most of all, I love that it's a prescient social commentary, subtly exploring how the power of the media has increased with soap-opera style histrionics and truth warped beyond recognition, something deconstructed throughout and bluntly summarised when Nick and smarmy half-wit reporter Ellen speak before the reunion interview and he gives her a piece of his mind (I'm trying to avoid putting in spoilers hence the vagueness). Two awkward moments - the smile and the photo - and the whole country is willing to crucify him as a hot-tempered, sociopathic cad and deify his missing wife, the blameless and pure golden girl, America's gorgeous sweetheart, the real life inspiration for popular children's character Amazing Amy - the fairytale effect as it applies to the news in real life, and the equally damaging effects of social media when used for the same ends.The film is also smart enough to make the whole world and cast gray, rather than fairytale black and white, so almost any viewpoint postulated throughout could be a possibility. Maybe some of the wild speculations about the main characters in the film's version of news reporting could be correct... for example, Nick's relationship with Margo, is it a standard sibling thing or is there something unsavoury beneath? It's up to you to decide when and where the characters are being truthful, and if/when they are being misunderstood. If at all. It literally is one of those movies that could be interpreted a different way each time you watch it, your allegiances changed by the perspective you watch it in at the time, by subtle clues you may only just have noticed.I could write pages on this, I really could. I need to see it again to remember all the little nuances that lurk within, the masterful touches that make this more than a cheesy TV movie with a higher budget. Affleck can act, something I'd forgotten as it's been a while since Good Will Hunting, and Pike plays one of the best femme fatales since Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction or that other one in The Hand That Rocks The Cradle - for me she is to movie females what Hannibal Lecter is to movie males, a cold and calculating psychotic who uses emotions like pieces in a chess game, for whom the satisfaction is creating a puzzle/trap and watching with glee as everyone stumbles into it like rats in a maze looking for the cheese. The audience is complicit in this - we have to run around looking for clues, playing detective, deciding whose truth is closest to the actual series of events.Anyway, my TL;DR is the text I sent a friend of mine to summarise: If you haven't already seen Gone Girl, I'd highly recommend it. Dark, intelligent psychological thriller with some mystery elements and a careful helping of social commentary. Arguably Fincher's best work since Fight Club.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Grade: A+,"Gone Girl is the latest addition to David Fincher's long filmography as a director of suspense and mystery. This particular film focuses far more on relationship dynamics than any other of his films of the same genre, and does a much better job with it than his movie The Curious Case of Benjamin Button did. Fincher has always been a master of camera and editing, but with Gone Girl, he proves he has truly mastered direction of the actors, and is in total command of everything on the screen.From the get-go, Gone Girl poses its driving questions: what happened to Amy Dunne, and was her husband Nick Dunne involved? Ben Affleck is very convincing as both an everyday suburban man and as the possible kidnapper of his wife. The film toys with the audience's emotions and sense of direction with its unreliable narrators: both Nick and Amy. We get the sense he's a good guy, but there's enough reason to doubt. Supporting him is his sister Margo, played by Carrie Coon in a spectacularly nuanced and overshadowed performance. She is helping Nick every step of the way; that is until she develops doubts of her own. Is Nick Dunne responsible for what happened to Amy?Our answer is handed to us on a silver platter in the middle of the film, a move that at first I thought was poor writing on Gillian Flynn's part. As the story continued though, I realized that this was necessary, because the story is not over, and the movie poses even more questions on the audience and soon you have no idea where the film will take you. It's a fun and terrifying ride all the way through.Gone Girl is supported by great performances by Rosamund Pike, who deserves an Oscar nomination for displaying an amazing range of character; Neil Patrick Harris, in possibly the most shadowy performance of his career; Kim Dickens as the head detective of the investigation; and Tyler Perry, who provides great comic relief in an otherwise dark and twisted film.As always, David Fincher's film features great cinematography (Fincher keeps his movie cinematic and distant by staying on a tripod and only moving in close when necessary), fantastic lighting to manipulate how we feel about the characters in certain scenes, and efficient editing (although in moments it doesn't linger where it should, some scenes end too abruptly).The ending might leave some frustrated, as it leaves with us more questions, but by the end, it doesn't matter: David Fincher has shown us in terrifying glory what people are capable of doing to each other, and doesn't try to make us feel comfortable or safe for a second. I left the theater feeling disturbed. And I wouldn't have had it any other way.Grade: A+",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Fincher Once Again Comes Thru,"Gone Girl (2014)**** (out of 4)David Fincher's adaptation of the best-selling novel about a husband (Ben Affleck) who finds himself under media scrutiny when his semi-famous wife (Rosamund Pike) goes missing is certainly something twisted and wicked but what would you expect from this director?I went into this film knowing nothing of the story, outside of the wife going missing, so I was really along for every twist and turn that the story threw at us. Obviously, with this type of mystery, it's impossible to fully discuss it without spoilers so I will avoid that for any new viewer. With that said, there's no question that Fincher can handle a bizarre mystery like this but what makes the film even more memorable is the rather sly and bitter social commentary on the media and how they'll destroy anyone just for a good story and ratings.Fincher is too smart to make the social commentary stick out like a sore thumb but he does manage to put it in the film and play it off well with the mystery that we're watching. The way the film unfolds is so brilliantly done and edited that you can't help but be wrapped up in the mystery one moment, cheering for one character the next minute but then a second later be feeling something completely different. The film had a rather laid back approach and it clocks in at nearly 150-minutes but the roller coaster ride is there from the opening scenes to the closing one. Again, I'm going to avoid spoilers but you and your date will certainly be discussing the outcome and events for months.What really helps are the terrific performances including Affleck who once again proves he can act whenever he wants to. This is easily the best performance of his career and not for a second do you see a superstar but instead you see a husband who is facing the biggest stress of his life. Pike is another standout as the wife who will certainly go down in history as....well, I can't say it because it would spoil too much. Neil Patrick Harris is also very good in his supporting role and even Tyler Perry brings a certain style and cockiness to his role, which was really needed. Carrie Coon as the sister and Kim Dickens are also stand-outs.GONE GIRL, due to its story, has a few moments that you might question and there's no question there are some major twists and turns along the way. What's clear is that this script and cast could be given to a dozen different directors and I think it's safe to say that ten would probably really mess it up. It's the type of story that one false move in the directing department could lead to a train wreck of a movie. Thankfully Fincher is smart enough to pull the material together, bring his style to it and deliver a very memorable film that keeps you guessing, and most importantly thinking, up until the credits roll.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Dark and twisted - Fincher at his best,"David Fincher is David Fincher and in my eyes he can do no wrong (because cinematically speaking he simply never does). Gillian Flynn's book got intense reactions out of its readers. It's a type of story that people either loved or hated and I have a feeling the same will happen with the film. I loved the book but I loved the movie just as much. This ended up being one of those rare situations in which I really did not mind changes made to the story - I think it has a lot to do with the fact that it was the writer herself who was adapting the book and that's probably why the changes did not take away from the impact of the story.This is not a movie for the faint of heart. If you are squeamish give it a pass. If you are a fan of David Fincher's work, you simply cannot pass up the chance to enjoy the fruits of his artistic labor. Fincher's understated style puts even more focus on the dark elements of the story about a love story gone wrong. Rosamund Pike finally got an opportunity to shine as an actress in a main role and it was about time. (and I think Ben Affleck was really great in a role of the husband) If you loved the book do not hesitate to see the film - David Fincher really manage to do justice to this beautifully twisted story.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

David Fincher has OUTDONE himself!!!,"David Fincher is one of the two directors which can blow your mind ,and the other one is Christopher Nolan. Gone Girl is directed by the Mastermind behind movies like Fight Club,Se7en,The Social Network,Zodiac -- David Fincher -- He just completely blew my mind. Another classic from the ACE Director Fincher. If you think Gillian Flynn's Book is good then you are definitely gonna love this movie. Gone Girl, starring Ben Affleck as Nick Dunne and Rosamund Pike as Amy Elliot Dunne ,as husband-wife, is a Mystery thriller with some amazing twist and turns that takes place with these couple and how the world & media reacts to them. Movies also goes deep into the thinking of a psychopath and his victim. Fincher directed the movie Perfectly, literally. Star of the movie is - Rosamund Pike - phew!! that girl just nailed the role of a lifetime, an amazing find by Fincher with a perfect role. Ben Affleck is good too but his character is not too expressing, so it was okay. Just 3 hrs ago i thought no movie can outdo the Fight Club, well that thought just got changed. MUST MUST WATCH!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
The lady vanishes,"The main plot twist, which could only be a surprise to those who haven't read the book, is very predictable, but some of the later twists are neatly executed, although often credulity-stretching. The ending is nicely unpredictable and brings a pleasing sense of Just Desserts.Ben Affleck makes a good fist of Mr Nice-Guy who may not be such a nice guy, but the movie belongs to Ms Pike. Her threatened wife is definitely not from the school of Doris Day in MIDNIGHT LACE; the echoes are rather more of Glenn Close in FATAL ATTRACTION or JAGGED EDGE, two movies to which this film owes a hefty debt.The sex-and-violence quotient is fairly high, but I'm surprised the film didn't sneak below its 18 rating. Leavened with some humour, particularly targeting the media vultures who descend on the family house in outlandish numbers, this is at heart just a spiced-up version of the earlier screen melodramas (THE LADY VANISHES!!) which must have inspired the author. Hokum, quality hokum even, well scripted and stylishly directed, but not quite as ""classy"" as WHAT LIES BENEATH, another of the movies that I found myself remembering while I sat through this.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"""Gone Girl""--Fast and Furious","Sometimes, while bringing a book to life in a movie, a lot is lost in translation—-not in this case. Both the book and the film are so damn good, perhaps because the extraordinary author, Gillian Flynn, is also the screenwriter and she knows what is an essential distillation of the narrative.The movie is a fast-paced dark and dangerous ride directed by the remarkable David Fincher (""Social Network"", and ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button""). Like the novel, the film leaves you questioning how well you truly know those around you, perhaps especially the person you married. Are there secrets you may never know?

Enormously entertaining,"I stepped away from horror for a few hours on Saturday to see this. I wasn't particularly eager to see it, but the reviews were too good for me to skip. I must say, it's amazing. I always say that Fincher is a good director, but he's completely dependent on the material he's given. Fortunately, the material here (a novel by Gillian Flynn, with a screenplay written by her) is excellent, and Fincher paces it beautifully. Also backing it up wonderfully is another great score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. The story shouldn't be gone into too much - though I knew the two major twists and still followed along with giddy enjoyment to every moment - but it opens with unhappy husband Ben Affleck discovering that his wife, Rosamund Pike, has gone missing. Evidence points heavily towards him, but he insists of his innocence. Soon the whole world seems against him. My favorite part of the film was the satire of the 24 hour news media. Missi Pyle is great as a loathsome TV news host obviously based on Nancy Grace. There are tons of excellent supporting performances, including Carrie Coon, Kim Dickens, Tyler Perry (yes, he's good!), Neil Patrick Harris, Patrick Fugit, Casey Wilson and Emily Ratajkowski amongst others. My second favorite film of 2014 so far and Fincher's best work ever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Don't Take It Too Seriously...It's Entertainment!,"I can't believe all the negative comments and reviews of this movie! And the Message Board comments are ridiculous with the comparisons to ""real"" life and the ""he wouldn't do that!"" and ""she couldn't get away with it!"" This movie is pure satire and entertainment. There is no reality or reason here. If you want to watch this movie and actually enjoy it, then put aside your common sense, pull out the popcorn and watch as the fairy tale story of Nick and Amy unfolds. You can expect a twisted tale of attraction and lust, love and hate, obsession and terror and you won't be disappointed.

Gone Girl will keep you guessing and leave you wanting more!,"Gone Girl will keep you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end! Rosemand Pike and Ben Affleck seem to have it all, that is until this perfect couple's life crumbles to something painfully scary to watch! Be ready to love and hate this all star cast. You will want to give a loud shout to each of the key players, and as the plot gets thicker and thicker you will not be ready for what unfolds, you may even shed a tear or two. And when the movie is all through you will be left with your jaw dropped, stomping your feet, while screaming NOOO! Gillian Flynn's; Gone Girl is absolutely one of the best thrillers of 2014!

Mind twisting thriller,"""They say the mind bends and twist in order to deal with the horrors of life"".Now that being said I have to say when I sit down to watch Gone Girl it is without a shadow of a doubt Gone Girl is one of the most intense and twisted films I ever watched.Not only for the chilling and powerful story but also visual and the tone of the film matching the story of the book it just more than enough to hold your attention it just delivers on high emotions and present itself to be one of the best films in a long time.However there are a few scenes that can be too much for the viewers and make you turn away trust me you will turn away from the scenes that can be too graphic just given a fair warning it still has a lot going for it.Rosamund Pike's performance is just perfect in this movie she deliver one of the best performance of any leading actress she just brought this movie to attention. Ben Affleck also showcase given the right script he can act and he did very good in the film, Tyler Perry also did a good job in the film. Along with the other cast members who did their part to give this movie the credit it deserves.The writing in the film is just unbelievable that it play mind games with you from the start and more than enough plot twist that will just shock you it likes they hired someone who knows the mystery of the mind to give you a thriller that it's biggest strength is the power of the mind it's just amazing how clever they pull this film together.Seriously the best way to give this film justice is for you to give it a watch because it just one of those rare Thrillers brought some of the most clever and most intense story telling ever in any motion picture and it showcase that there is hope for motion picturesWith powerful Story telling, amazing performances and visual that matches the tone of this film you will be in aweI Give Gone Girl an 8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Coffee,"I sometimes enjoyed this, however what prised me off was the Lead detective arrives at the scene with a large cup of coffee, search's the scene with one hand whilst the other hand contains the coffee cup, every scene with the cop is her with the cup of coffee, what utter bs, since when would this happen in real life, even in the USA. This just ruined the whole movie, clumsy in my opinion, really can't see how it gets an eight? Lead actress certainly deserved her nomination for best supporting actress.

Three out of four ain't bad,I loved the first three quarters of this movie but I think the ending was ridiculous and almost funny. The acting was great but the premise became ridiculous. All clues point to the aloof husband as a missing wife cast is investigated. The whole town helps to figure out the whereabouts of Kate. I was hoping for more aha moments but it became so far fetched it disappointed me. I must give it credit for being an extraordinary tale and it had me guessing all throughout. Ben Afleck did a superb job in a part that seemed made for him and Ms. Rosemund Pike did a great USA accent. Three out of the four stages of this movie is great.,6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Lame and unrealistic.,"Currently rated 8.0 on IMDb... are you kidding me?This film is not THE worst I've seen, but, in all honestly, 8.0 is far, far too high a rating for what I thought was one of the lamest movies I've seen in recent years.If you're going to make a movie that doesn't have a protagonist... if you just want to tell a story... at least make sure it's a good story and believable to some degree. The events in this movie are so unrealistic and played-up - things like that would NEVER happen in real life.There are lots and lots of really obvious plot-holes - not a good thing in a move that's already near-unwatchable.Some events in the movie are shockingly unrealistic. For example, all she does for disguise is dye her hair a slightly darker colour. Then she (with her new identity) sits with her new-found friends watching (and discussing) her own story on TV, and nobody seems to notice that the woman on TV is the same one sitting next to them, with slightly darker hair. Oh, puh-lease. If this isn't an insult to human intelligence, then I don't know what is.Basically, there are plenty of ""what-the-fcuk"" moments; it makes you wonder whether the people involved in the project were intending this movie for the mentally handicapped. Indeed, one HAS to be a bit ""slow"" in order to enjoy this poorly-written plot. If you're into analyzing movies, you will find this one downright insulting, I'm sure.This movie can be criticized for hours - there's too much that's wrong with it, but I think I've wasted enough time watching, and then reviewing, this train-wreck of a movie, so I'll be moving on now.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Basic Instinct Would Be Proud,"Gone Girl is a mystery thriller that would make fans of Basic Instinct proud. It has the vibe of the 1992 film and does an excellent job of keeping the viewer following the story as a bystander from the film. When events unfold the audience is lead to have the view point of those watching the story on the news. You rarely have time to think ahead as the film has so much action and information relayed in the present.The film follows Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) as he discovers that his wife is missing and the resulting media attention to the disappearance. As more and more clues turn up events cause the viewer to question the husbands role in his wife's (Rosamund Pike) disappearance.This story is expertly written to keep the audience on their toes throughout the entire film. David Fincher (Seven, Fight Club) directs the film to perfection. He creates an atmosphere of suspense and doubt that grips the viewer and never lets go. Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry give great performances that show the versatility of their acting skills. Ben Affleck gives another top notch performance to add to the list of his recent hits while Rosamund Pike steals the show.If you are looking for an intelligent thriller that views like you are reading a book make sure to add Gone Girl to your list. Watch it with a friend or during the daytime because a late night solo viewing might test your nerve.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
It's a brilliant film and one of the most cynical films made on marriage.,"It's a brilliant film and one of the most cynical films made on marriage.Marriage is one of the most toughest bonds of human race. To sustain that thread despite all it's finesse and yet it's shambles, there is always an inherent fear that a small knife may cut the whole thread. Marriage is one of the finest threads that was ever made, Now to go to any extent in marriage is also possible, but does any sane marriage involve self-murder, no and I can say that's almost impossible. All married ones beware before you watch this and those anticipating marriage, think again of the one whom you are going to marry. Marriage or rather a relationship with the person we love is going to thought through after seeing this in a theater, I bet you.Impossible is nothing for this director David Fincher who has made mind boggling films like FIGHT CLUB. He turns a simple story head on, adds a flavor that's so spicy that you may love it or hate but you just can't ignore it. He gives similar treatment to this film.You start understanding and decoding the story, it becomes something and then after few minutes if you think you have almost sorted it out, then again it transpires into something else. It's a tough one to call and I can only say, this is mind boggling stuff. Fincher is one of the few directors who can direct the film in a way that is deeply interesting and yet there are many layers involved into it.This is a very layered movie, like an onion as the layers are peeled, we seem to get to the core, but this is something more surprising, the moment we think we got it, we would have lost it. It tests the intelligence of the viewer and that's how this film has won hearts.I can safely say, this is one of the very intelligent movies that has come in recent times. I have not seen much of Rosamund Pike who plays Amy Dunne in this film but she is the true protagonist who drove the story all by herself. Just her portrayal as Amy has made her one of the finest actresses of this year. The rest of the cast has done a good job too.A 4/5 for a must watch film and I request this has to be seen in theaters, let the naked truth be told brutally if need be.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"good performances abound, and love the social/media commentary","Granted, I'm behind on finishing-up my 2014 watch-list, and I still have ""Interstellar"", ""Birdman"", ""American Sniper"", ""Whiplash""(late edit new#1) and ""Nighcrawler"" on my watchlist, so there is still a lot of sorting- out to do in terms of my 2014 top 25 list. BUT, for now, ""Gone Girl"" is at the top.That's out of about 50 viewed films from last year.""Gone Girl"" is an absolute immersion into a great murder mystery. The plot seems to be ever-evolving, and the whole thing is bolstered by some fantastic performances from a great cast. The six largest roles(Affleck, Pike, Harris, Perry, Coon, and Dickens) are deftly handled. Tyler Perry is probably the best surprise here, but everyone is good.The film has pitch-perfect pacing. It doesn't wait too long to get into the main plot, and most of the character-development is done via flashbacks, and just enough is used to both give us some background, but not tell us too much about the 'character' of these characters. Most of that comes late in the film, and that's good because it helps the audience reserve judgement.Trent Reznor's music is toned way down from say ""Social Network"", but I think that's appropriate for a film where the plot is the main course.The entire movie is ""less fancy"" than FIncher's previous work, but it's right up there with everything else. On my ratings I have it a smidge below ""The Game""(#2 of 1997), about even with ""Social Network""(#2 film for 2010), ""Seven""(#2 of 1995) and ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" (#2 film for 2011),.. it's a touch better than ""Zodiac""(my #5 film of 2007) and ""Fight Club""(#9 for 1999)... it's a lot better than ""Curious Case"" and ""Panic Room"", neither of which made my top 25.This film throws out some pretty big twists in the last half-hour. It couldn't have ended any other way, but the ending is certainly one aspect that might detach this film from it's audience as we really want to see what happens next - but isn't that a trademark of many great films?I highly recommend this. I went-in with some pretty high expectations and it did NOT disappoint.The three others I watched it with concurred..very...good...movie. Albeit less re-watchable than some of his other works - if for no other reason than the genre. I'd still like to watch it again though.88/100It could have used just a touch more scoring, and perhaps a bit more of Fugit and Dickens' cop scenes to further explore that side of things, but overall, it's very good, and it will certainly hold onto a top 5 spot for 2014. Can it hold onto the top spot? Dunno, we'll see.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
One of the best mystery films I've ever seen,"Gone Girl is a mystery thriller film starring Ben Affleck and directed by David Fincher (Fight Club, The Social Network etc.), based on the novel of the same name. It was excellent, one of the best mystery films I've ever seen. It was very well paced and kept my attention the entire time. Ben Affleck was great too. I think it's safe to say he's well and truly redeemed himself by now.The story focuses on a man named Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck), whose wife Amy (Rosamund Pike), amid their failing marriage and losing both their jobs, suddenly goes missing one morning. Due to the amounting evidence against him and the way the media portrays him, Nick quickly becomes the prime suspect for her disappearance.As I mentioned previously, Ben Affleck was great in this movie. It showed the potential he has to be a good Bruce Wayne/Batman in the upcoming Batman VS Superman film. The direction by David Fincher was excellent as well. All of his director's trademarks were there, from his silhouetted dimly lit scenes to his ambient musical score composed by Trent Reznor from Nine Inch Nails.I rate it 9/10. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys mystery films and the work of director David Fincher.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
It's OKAY...,"I'd say it wasn't as good as I expected... and I guess that was the problem. I expected too much. I can imagine this movie would've been a surprisingly good if I didn't expect anything but the media hype ruined the experience for me.I see two major flaws. Many plots are unrealistic. The movie makes it seem so easy to frame and get away with murder. Second flaw being Ben Affleck. I command his success as writer, director, and producer lately but his acting just never improves. And this was very interesting role too. Only he can make such interesting character so mundane. And in contrast, Rosamund Pike's performance was surprisingly good.I certainly am not looking forward to him being the new Batmat...This movie could've been so much better with different lead actor.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

"Started great, middle OK...then bombs.","OK, so I saw this film tonight at my local cinema and was hopeful the movie would live up to the hype I had been reading. Yes I have heard that the book is great although can't be bothered with reading it.Anyway the film starts slowly where Affleck's wife goes missing and we follow the manhunt and the media frenzy as BA tries to put the puzzles together about his wife whereabouts, with his twin sister. Evidence start to stack up against Affleck as does peoples opinion. I won't spoil it for anyone but the plot didn't disappoint and the film is quite enjoyable for the most part.Direction, acting, music and storyline blend well together to reward the film-goer. But here is where the film disappointed me or rather the storyline. For the last 15 minutes of the film I could not believe what was happening. It was as the author had given up on the last pages his book on how to come up with a great ending and goes for some unbelievable long-shot, hope it will stick conclusion. The story was so captivating and believable that I could see Fincher on the red carpet with the Oscar, but the ending killed the movie for me.When all is said is done, could have been thriller of the year(IMO) but came up short.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
One of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life!,"It has been two days since I saw Gone Girl, and I am still seething inside. Not because of the poor casting, the worse acting,the stilted and pretentious dialogue, the ludicrous plot contrivances throughout, the laughably idiotic ending, the illogic, the unnecessarily long running time, the boredom, the inanity, the vile atmosphere, the lousy score, or any of the other details that made this the most excruciatingly painful cinematic disaster that I have ever experienced. Nope, and I don't plan on expounding on any of this stuff here, either. That's already been done more than adequately, and would just be piling on to the exceedingly obvious.So why did I register here to write my very first review EVER on such a forum? I guess it's mainly because such a huge percentage of the viewing audience enjoyed this rancid bucket full of wriggling fish guts, and I seriously need to vent. Look, we all have our guilty pleasures when it comes to film, and I'll be the first to admit that I probably like my fair share of stinkers for one reason or another. But Gone Girl goes beyond the pale of what should be minimally acceptable in terms of base artistic competence. What the hell is wrong with you, movie-goers? Were you not paying attention at all? This movie is ridiculously bad, bad, BAD, and at every turn! How can the public, not to mention the lion's share of professional critics, for godsake, lap up this excrement? Was there a big sale on lobotomies somewhere?Anyway, I guess that's my rant. I DID want to extend my sincere thanks to all the reviewers here who seem to more or less agree with my take. To tell the truth, I was so riled up by the end of this picture that I literally felt physically ill for some time afterwards, and it was such a refreshing balm to come here and discover it wasn't just me.

Meet a Psychopath,"After a stressful day of work, I decided to go to the show and see Gone Girl. The reviews after release were strong, and I was intrigued. I will be frank that Ben Allfeck has never been one of my favorite actors. Nevertheless, I relented and found myself sucked into an intriguing plot about a story I knew nothing about. In a way, I like being surprised having not read the book before seeing the movie. I think had I known the outcome it wouldn't have been as interesting.Unfortunately, I can tell you NOTHING in this review beyond the superficial gist of the movie. It would be a crying shame to spoil it for you, so I won't.The story starts out on the truthful fact that marriage is hard work. Marriages can fail. People can drift apart. However, it's how the husband and wife of a marital union handle the challenges that determine the outcome of sticking together or getting a divorce.We've all been privy to true-life instances in the media where a man has killed his wife. The plot is like watching the 6 o'clock news of the latest missing spouse. Nick Dunne returns home one day to find his cat wandering outside and his front door open. When he enters the house, he finds a scene reminiscent of a struggle and his wife has disappeared.Of course, when the police get involved, Nick is the first person they attempt to eliminate in this strange disappearance of Amy Dunne. Nick is far too nonchalant about her disappearance, which sheds suspicion upon him. Everyone thinks he murdered his wife. As the story progresses, more evidence mounts against him making him look quite guilty of bludgeoning her to death. Nick, on the other hand, is playing a game of anniversary clue with his missing wife and decides that she is staging an elaborate prank.Needless to say, the movie's first half is riddled with the question of whether he did or did not kill Amy. You are left with the evidence to sort out on your own until suddenly the story takes an 180 degree turn in the opposite direction. I will confess that I had this sneaking suspicion it was going to play out this way. Even though I was correct in my assumption, it certainly did not prepare me to see the outcome that leaves you speechless, questioning, unresolved, and unsatisfied. It's quite a void after the credits roll, which haunts you on the way out to the parking lot.Even though Ben isn't my favorite actor, I will say his performance in this movie is well played. He was the droll and unconcerned husband at one point, worried at another, and mortified toward the end. As far as Rosamund Pike's performance, she was so disquieting I hope I never meet her face-to-face. Outstanding performance that will define her for years to come.Somewhere in this story lurks a narcissistic psychopath that will make your skin crawl. The film doesn't have any fright factor, except for one horribly disturbing scene that will make you gasp as it plays out. However, like any good thriller it does a good job of leaving you inwardly distraught as a result. In conclusion, it's worth a movie ticket, a medium popcorn, and two and half hours of sitting in a dark theater. Though I read there was a scene of frontal nudity of Ben Affleck's prize possessions, I'm here to report I never saw anything. I mean that too! I'm not sure if they cut it out of the film or if my eyes just glazed over. Maybe I can get a partial refund since I didn't get my money's worth.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A captivating tale,"The less you know about this movie, the better. I consider myself lucky enough to have had no expectations.While I don't dislike Ben Affleck, the director is whom I'm a fan of. ""Gone Girl"" seems to be a typical mystery/thriller on the surface (and it is, to a certain extent), but there were quite a few unexpected turns and shifts that made me wonder what genre it really belongs to.With a two and a half hour runtime, the narrative and pace never got me bored. Several elements could have been so cliché in the hands of the wrong storyteller, but here they were handled effectively.The acting is overall credible, Ben's performance believable even though his body-language makes him more often than not look like a bull in a china-shop. Rosamund Pike shines here. I'm not familiar with her work but her role will certainly reverberate strongly in her career in many years to come.My only slight surprise was how low-key Fincher was in his style, in comparison to his previous work, such as ""Panic Room"" and ""Fight Club"".I recommend this movie for a mature audience.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Fincher on top form with an enthralling classic,"(Note that this review will be specifically spoiler free!)One of the year's most anticipated films, David Fincher's Gone Girl doesn't disappoint delivering a stylish and sophisticated cinematic punch to the guts.Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) arrives home on the day of his fifth wedding anniversary to find the door open, signs of disarray inside the house and his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) ""gone"". Amy is the real life incarnation of ""Amazing Amy"" – the fictional children's character of books authored by her parents (played well by David Clennon and Lisa Banes), and so is something of a minor celebrity. As such, her disappearance generates an intense media frenzy and suspicion quickly falls on the hapless husband Nick, who can seem to do nothing right in terms of self-implication.Speaking from the pages of her own diary, Amy describes a marriage that appears to be far less idyllic than it appears to the Missouri neighbourhood in which she lives, adding further fuel to the fire.To say more (all of the above is within the trailer) would be wrong. Just to say that It is a roller-coaster of a script, by Gillian Flynn from her own novel, and delivers a suitable number of twists and turns.Ben Affleck is excellent in the role of Nick, but the acting star of the show for me is former Bond girl Rosamund Pike as the flashback-featured Amy: a stunningly good performance and I would be surprised if this doesn't end up with an Oscar nomination.David Fincher clearly brings out the best in his actors, with Neil Patrick Harris (TV child star of ""Doogie Howser"") playing a creepy part extremely well, Tyler Perry highly entertaining as Nick's legal beagle, Carrie Coon excellent in a film debut as Margot, Nick's supportive sister, and Kim Dickens (""Hollow Man"", ""The Blind Side"") riveting as the detective investigating the case. Also outstanding, in a couple of notable ways as well as the acting, is British-born Emily Ratajkowski. A brilliant ensemble cast that work extremely well together.Key contributors to the film are Fincher's usual soundtrack team of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross (""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"", ""The Social Network""), who deliver a genuinely spooky and highly effective soundtrack that again I would suggest is well into Oscar nomination territory.Whilst I have some quibbles with the overall story (it is easy to pick holes in it as the lights come up) I can't readily fault the film it is another Fincher classic and I suspect that this film will feature large at the Oscars in February. Note that (after my recent rant about the ""15"" certificate awarded to ""The Equalizer"") the film earns its ""18"" certificate for a combination of sex, language and violence. The film is genuinely disturbing in places.One of the most enthralling and well executed films of the year so far.(If you enjoyed this review, please see my other reviews at bob-the-movie-man.com.

Messed up movie.,"I think that this movie was a dark and very messed up one, I think that both of the main characters were awful people in their own right and I think that this was one of the most unsatisfying movies I've ever seen. I really think that both of the mains got away with both been crazy and evil. Although Ben and Rosamund played the characters well, I find myself hating both of them and would've liked to see them get punished. In the end it was a great thriller but an awful ending in my opinion.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
I Felt Like Something to Be Jettisoned,"Once in awhile a film comes around that throws your brain into so many places that it becomes hard to come to grips if you actually like it or not. Don't get me wrong I liked Gone Girl. I think it's a brilliantly directed film. But this film also ticked me off more than one I can remember. David Fincher films tend to have that effect on you at times. And a sign of a great film is one that makes you think for hours upon hours after viewing, and Gone Girl does that. It's one of the most twisted, obscure, and disturbing films I have seen. But not because any obscene images or gross out scenes. But because it is such a cynical view on marriage and relationships in general, or even just the human brain. You leave the theater asking, do people really think like this? Is trust a big enough issue to where a sustainable relationship is completely off the table? First of all, major props to everyone involved with this film. All of the performances are marvelous. Affleck is at his best and Rosamund Pike gives what is most likely an Oscar worthy turn. But it's once again David Fincher who is the star of the film. Every scene looks and sounds beautiful (thanks to a little help from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross). Fincher directs with such ease that at times you feel like you're actually observing these events happen in Missouri and not in a theater. A scene in particular near the end of the film that was so perfectly directed and looks so unbelievably real that it's hard not picture Fincher getting an Oscar nomination for directing.The screenplay was done by the author of the book of the same name by Gillian Flynn. From what I hear, she is great at writing well developed characters. And I think the characters worked really well on screen. Tyler Perry's Tanner Bolt gave both comedic flare and a relatable character for the audience in a movie that involves several off-the-wall crazy people. I'd like to think that I can trust the people closest to me to be honest and not hide secrets. It's hard to like any of the characters in this film. Fincher often gives us glimpses of good characters but with many flaws. Gone Girl very well may be his most depressing movie. It's hard to imagine this author having a family and kids and being able to write such horrific tales without thinking twice.Onto the highly publicized 'twists'. I'll say right off the bat that I didn't expect any of them coming. But I wasn't overly shocked either. It was built up to me to be something that is so unthinkable that it will be hard to wrap your mind around. Sure the film surprised me at times, but it's no Se7en. I think if I wouldn't have had both my sister and my girlfriend build this book and it's twists up so high I would have had a more fulfilling experience. But I did love watching this movie. It's also perhaps a movie I appreciate more on second viewing. Most of Fincher's work is significantly better after a few watches.Overall Gone Girl sets out to do exactly what it wants to. It's a haunting tale and the supposed ""husband kills wife"" style film. It's also a funny play on the media today and how our view on the world is solely based on what the media feeds us. With this beginning the Oscar season it's hard to say how it shapes up against the field. But I will say Pike and Fincher are locks. With Affleck hopefully picking up his first acting nomination as well. As a score, it's very hard to give one. This film is truly the 'Zodiac killings' of a review. I don't know that I will ever grasp what the right score is for a film like this.+Pike+Affleck deserves his first acting nomination+Fincher's direction is PERFECT+Well written characters+Does exactly what it sets out to do+Tyler Perry was actually GREAT!+Score-Not-so-shocking twists-Ticked me off-Ending8.4/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Gone Girl,"With his wife's disappearance having become the focus of an intense media circus, a man sees the spotlight turned on him when it's suspected that he may not be innocent.Gone Girl is directed by David Fincher, adapted by Gillian Flynn from her 2012 novel of the same name. It stars Ben Affleck, Rosemund Pike, Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry. I was really excited about this film as David Fincher is on of my favorites director and he's a perfectionist so I knew deep down that it'll be a good one. I was even more excited when I discovered that he hired Ben Affleck to play the husband. This role is perfect for him and he's fantastic in this movie. Rosemund Pike is also excellent; this is probably the best work I've seen from her. I loved it. First I have to say that I read the book before... But for those who did not read the book before, you barely know anything going to this movie. The trailer didn't reveal a lot of things and details, which you don't need to know until you are sitting in the theater experiencing the movie for yourselves. There are so many hidden facts to the story and that I won't spoil to you as so you'll be able to experience them without knowing. I'm glad to see that Fincher cherishes this kind of movie experiences as well. As the film progresses I was continuously surprised, it got darker and darker and meaner. My mouth was dropped. It's really intriguing and you don't know who to root for. You are the detective, watching everything the husband does. Plus, this movie legitimately make you think about the way we perceive the media, the news and factual events. How you just see what the media is showing you. You don't know all the facts. Also how the news and media affect the situation of this man; as a viewer I evolved behind the scenes of how a person's life can crumbled to the ground simply based on a few lies. Technically Fincher is a visionary director and that's what I love about his work. His frames are PERFECT. Secondly I liked the fact that twits and turns of the movie don't came out as showy as I'm use to; just as ""wow..."" thanks to this really good screenplay. The cast was really good. Beside Ben Affleck and Rosemund Pike who are fantastic, I wasn't sure of Tyler Perry and Neil Patrick Harris... So let me tell you that they are great as well! Finally, for being as long as it is the story keeps you certainly interested till the end with an heavy content. You want to get to the end to find out what really happened? What will happen now? And then? What's next for them? This movie is REAL, every situation is realistic. This is obviously one of the best movie of the year. It's a dark story, even a bit rude but I can see the truth in a lot of things that are portrayed. What is so shocking is that things like this are really happening in nowadays society.Overall Gone Girl has some flawless features, a dramatically powerful core, it's wonderfully acted and it's damn sad when you start thinking about it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Bye bye,"I haven't read the novel, so I cannot compare the movie with it or tell you if David Fincher changed anything (for better or worse). So I can only judge this movie without anything in the back of my head comparing anything. Being free of that, I can say that I really loved this movie. I had my expectations and even having seen the trailer, I was surprised by quite a few things that happened in it.Performance wise you get more than great work. Ben Affleck might have gotten a lot of backlash, because he got cast as Batman (his Daredevil stint might have to do a bit with that and his Gigli movie), but he's showing here that he can act. The movie also shows us depths of human behavior we wish didn't exist, but we know they do. This really does go out there, with (some) nudity and violence, so it's not for the squeamish. The story alone though might have a bigger and harder punch for some, than anything shown ...",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"I enjoyed it, but the ending nearly ruined it","For its first hour, it is a well done murder mystery: did Nick Dunn kill his seemingly angelic wife? All signs seem to point to him, perhaps even a bit too much.In its second hour, it successfully changes to, basically, a chilling portrait of this evil bitch plotting to frame her husband for her own murder. So far, so good.But in the final 20 minutes, the story awkwardly, unsuccessfully switches gears again, and becomes a satire, giving us no resolution to the story, and expects us to ignore several gaping plot holes. We, the audience, were taking the story mostly seriously, but then we find out we were not supposed to, apparently, which makes the entire two and a half hour ordeal seem pointless.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Gone Girl. She be gone!,"I wasn't planning on seeing Gone Girl, but I'm glad I did. For a movie that has a listed running time of 149 minutes – which translates to 3 hours plus of cinema chair buttock time – it engaged for the entire period, with no lulls or 'boring bits'. At its core Gone Girl is a dramatic mystery, although moments of humour and horror are applied to provoke audience reaction – a particular standout moment had everyone in the cinema looking at each other with ""damn', did that just happen!"" across their eyeballs. You'll know the bit. The situational drama becomes ridiculous and convoluted - but at the same time is entirely believable. To allude to the plot would ruin much of the surprise, but the initial premise of 'girl is missing' is built upon to reveal a far more interesting tale. The polish of the movie should hardly be surprising really – David Fincher (Fight Club, Social Network) continues to direct story adaptations to a very high standard, capturing the ambiance of suburban America and providing a commentary on the role that sensationalised media and the age of instant communication can have in preconceiving instant judgements. Oh yeah, and the circumstances surrounding (some) missing people. The acting performances are delivered very well across the board. Ben Affleck's second coming continues (let's hope it carries on for Batman vs!), but it is Rosamund Pike that really stands out. She has been in a lot of films I've seen recently (A Long Way Down, Hector and the Search for Happiness, What We Did on Our Holiday) with Gone Girl delivering the most complex and complete character performance yet. It wouldn't be surprising to see recognition come awards season. Added to the great direction and quality acting is another grade A theatrical score from Trent Reznor – the electro classical combination creates genuine moments of disquiet and tension at key points as the plot unfolds. So why wasn't I hyped for Gone Girl in the first place? I mean, the movie doesn't really have any faults. Well, it was a case of the trailer judge hitting the hammer and missing the mark. The trailer looks like it tells you the entire story, in what felt like a desperate attempt to garner interest – but that was a very incorrect assessment by myself. If you like good quality drama stories, take the time to watch Gone Girl, it doesn't feel like 3 hours. Note:- if you are watching with a partner, just make sure you are solid before going into this.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A movie that should get people thinking,"The movie starts out as the story of a couple, and it evolved a lot, in a complex manner, but predictable(at least to me). The acting was very good, the plot was also realistic, what people should really get from this movie is that not everything they see on TV is true, and that appearances are deceptive, good and evil are concepts we shouldn't be hypocrite about or take for granted just because some other people tell us what the definition of those two words are, and I believe this movie has done a marvelous job of questioning our 21st Western society's moral dogma, more than offering us with an interesting story.I would recommend this movie to all people, except minors, because of it's violent scenes.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

"Not only is Gone Girl as good as you've heard, it's better!","Directed by David Fincher (The Social Network, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo) and based on a popular novel by Gillian Flynn, Gone Girl is the story of Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) who discovers on the morning of his 5th wedding anniversary that his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) has disappeared. As police begin to investigate her disappearance, it becomes clear that their marriage is not as it seemed and soon after the media descends on his home to cover the salacious story. Seedy details about Nick's personal life emerge and his strange behavior only serves to fuel suspicion. As lies are uncovered and secrets are revealed, inevitably the police, the media and the public arrive at the same conclusion: Nick Dunne murdered his wife.I loved just about everything about this movie; whether it's the creepy score, it's consistent suspenseful tone or it's scathing critique on marriage and the dangers of ""keeping up of appearances"". At first the film goes where you might expect; you'll laugh at the silly moments of their courtship, you'll fawn over their romance as the story of their relationship is retold leading up to her disappearance. But marriages are not often as they seem and neither is this film; you'll recoil as events unfurl (for the sake of not spoiling this for anyone, I won't say any more than that). Let's just say this film has a few scenes that will shock and stay with you! It was very unpredictable and had a few turns that had me gasping out loud.There's also some obvious, but still really interesting commentary on public perception, the power of the media and it's ability to drive narrative (I found this to be a pretty sobering and relevant analogy given current events and how the US media has portrayed them). The film also cleverly plays on gender stereotypes and uses them to effectively drive home it's message. At times this felt like an unconventional horror film (I might even say it's a modern day take on Psycho), but it also has some elements of Fatal Attraction.While I thought Ben Affleck's performance was nothing to really get excited about (he does have a few strong scenes), what really stands out here is Rosamund Pike (Barney's Version, An Education). Her performance as Amy is simply incredible! As the snobby film critics would say, this is a ""Tour De Force"" kind of performance. She really takes over this film and delivers work that you can't help but get immersed in. If she doesn't get an Oscar nomination, it will be a travesty because this was an unforgettable performance and I can't think of a better performance I've seen this year to date. Yes, it's THAT good.The last 15 minutes may leave you a little puzzled (characters make decisions I can only describe as incredibly strange), lead to a few questions and will spark debate. I'm usually never a fan of ""I need to spend an hour on the IMDb Message Boards so I can full understand this"" kind of ending, but it does seem somewhat appropriate given the tone of this film. This is also definitely the kind of film that requires multiple viewings to grasp all of it's themes and I will certainly oblige as I found this completely engrossing.Thoroughly entertaining from start to finish, this really is a brilliant film and easily one of the best of the year. Do yourself a favor and find a way see this, you won't regret it.Was my review not horrible? Great!

"7 for the thriller, 8 for the message about our relationships","This movie starts out as any other thriller out there, the wife to the main character has gone missing after a few hours away from home and the search is on to find her. Nick played by Ben Affleck is a somewhat dull character and it's actually hard to tell if that's because he is played by Ben Affleck or if it's the reason Ben Affleck got the role. Sorry Ben. Under the surface Nick is clearly not as much of a nice guy as he would make others believe and any critic with a feminist view saying Nick is portrayed as a good guy with the wife being portrayed as a bad guy needs to put their sunglasses away.Compared to Nick, the wife Amy is an intriguing character played by Rosamund Pike which I really think is an asset to this movie and hopefully we'll see more of her in the future. Besides Amy, few characters contain any substance to chew on for the audience and overall it's quite stereotypic. The story as it unfolds also feels a bit too fictional and Desi Collings played by Neil Patrick Harris feels downright silly.However, the movie gets your attention and makes 2.5 hours go relatively fast. The dynamics between Nick and Amy as we are told is interesting.But what this movie really does is using the format of a thriller to deliver a strong message about the roles we humans play in our relationships to get our needs fulfilled, both the ones we are born with and the needs we've been learned to have. This role playing is something we do everyday, mostly happening below our radar making it even more effective. When the movie in the end then introduce a very concrete and real role playing game above our attention radar we are tricked into thinking that this is something awful happening. But, just as we are told, in reality this is not at all different to the constant role playing we spend the days of our lives doing; ""this is what marriage is"".",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
One of the best thrillers in years.,"Gone girl is an excellent thriller with so many twists. It keeps you guessing through the entire film, I thought it was a little slow on the uptake, but as the film goes on, you realise it really needed that slow start to help build up the image of the perfect life slowly falling to pieces. The quality of acting is brilliant, especially Rosamund Pike. The only exception being Missi Pyle as Ellen Abbott who I thought was awful, I cringed every time she was on screen. But don't let that ruin the film for you. I must admit, the ending lets the film down a little bit. After sitting through a two and a half hour film, you want an eventful end, something that makes it feel worthwhile. Unfortunately, it just kinda finishes... it's an interesting but largely unsatisfying end. I would have rated this film a 9 if the ending had have been more satisfying. Overall, one of the best thrillers in years, needs to be watched.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Human Is Horror,"I am a fan of horror films, but this drama / thriller manages to be scarier and more horrifying than the branded horror ones. It reveals how brutal and violent some people can become, while some others try to be moral and sane. I have this effect almost in every one of David Fincher's films, especially ""Seven"", ""The Game"", ""Zodiac"". He digs into the dark side of human heart, and found. I believe Fincher use a few selected unusual individuals as a platform to tell his stories, but it somehow feels a lot more universal than that. He makes us feel that these dark sides are all over and not at all unusual. Look at the character of Amy. Hers is not what one would easily come across. But we feel most natural to see her roaming around and planning her next sick moves. This is David Fincher's gift. He tells someone's story, and it becomes everyone's story. I am not native to the US, so I can't critique on how realistic it is as an American story. I saw some bashing at this film, perhaps to get its rating down a notch or two. But it feels real and around for me. An article is recently released on how and why Americans are so attracted at killing themselves. There is a linkage between the article's thesis and this film's plot line. A very free society has its weakness: it is so free a weak soul can feel so unattached and get blown away by just a breeze. In fact, I had been in the US for a few years, and start to understand how ordinary and un-winnable it feels to be an average American. The country has achieved a great success as a society, millions still yearn to go there, and yet it keeps pushing people for more and more. Is this by way of explaining random shootings, school killings, and serial killings in the US? If so, ""Gone Girl"" should be renamed as ""All Gone"" or ""Almost Gone"" to be appropriate.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
The 1-star reviewers are missing a very important point...,"I was quite surprised to see so many people bashing this movie and even bashing other people for liking this movie. It seems like most of the negative reviews are from people spotting ""holes"" in the plot and calling the entire movie unbelievable. Well, I'm sorry, but you're missing the point entirely.A huge theme throughout the movie is this: facts are not as important as the perception of those facts. Why are there no court scenes in the movie? Because their trial is the Media, with Ellon Abbot presiding as judge and America as the jury. Tyler Perry's character is not being paid to be Nick's lawyer in court. He's his ""lawyer of the media"", a PR consultant. Why does Nick have to practice putting on a certain face whenever he talks to media? Or why Tyler Perry's character urges Nick to come forward publicly with his ""secret"" before anyone else does? Because the Media decides who is innocent and who is guilty.Are there ""holes"" in the plot? Absolutely. But the holes don't matter in the movie because America makes their judgments from what the Media has told them. The capstone to this point is when the detective starts rattling off holes in Amy's story, ironically just as the negative reviewers here on IMDb are doing as well. And why did the FBI agent react so negatively to the detective's questioning, which was mere due diligence on her part? The answer to that question is the point.It's a shame so many people missed this.Overall, this movie is well acted and very well directed. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Trash,Just watched this film tonight on DVD. I was looking forward to it as I heard so much about it and being up for awards. What are they so excited about? I found it a horrible movie. Falling asleep in first half of it and then could not believe it when she was found alive. From then on I couldn't stand any one in the film save Neil Patrick Harris and female detective.The female lead was awful and so was her acting. I was hoping she'd get put away where she belonged. Ben Affleck did okay but not his type of film. I felt he wasn't given a decent script and spent most of the film in a sort of trance. His character was so weak when you thought he'd drop the dame fast. But she controls him and I hated that. No one in this film has any redeeming quality at all. But maybe Harris. Big mistake for Ben to do this. No one else in film any good. Sorry. It really made me sick.,,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

A short review *GONE GIRL*,"Doesn't matter how many times I've seen it, It still grips me and catches me off guard every time. The book was pretty damn good, no question, but Fincher takes Gillian Flynn's novel/screenplay and elevates the words into hypnotically watchable cinema. Easily his most unusual cast(Ben Affleck, Neil Patrick Harris and TYLER PERRY?!) and yet every single actor is PERFECT and even though she wouldn't have been my first choice, Rosamund Pike is incredibly sinister and calculative as ""Amazing"" Amy and definitely earned her Oscar nomination for Best Actress that year. It's not Fincher's most provocative or disturbing work but it's still one of his very best films and without a doubt worth more than one viewing to really take in the collage of performances, story, music, sound and indelible images. It's truly one of those movie you should before you die",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Ok thriller,Ok thriller. I have heard some say that the film is a statement on marriage but who cares. It still needs to be told within the framework or the rules for which the rest of the story has been set. I read someone else say that it is OK to switch your brain off for a movie as long as that is established early in the film but not in the last half of an hour. The ending ruined several story threads and made them pointless. If anyone seriously thinks the film was some serious commentary on the state of marriage then I think you are kidding yourself in the hope of convincing yourself that you are smarter than you are. But even if it was no excuse for dropping the ball to get the story over with. I have no issue with Amy getting away with it or being convicted or being killed or whatever end the author chose but that needed to be done well. Instead it ended in the laziest way imaginable and therefore ruined the time I had invested in watching the movie to that point.,6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Exceeds the established expectations of crime thrillers.,"Gillian Flynn published a book titled ""Gone Girl"" in 2012, which soared to the New York Times bestseller lists, captivated critics, and invigorated audiences across America. As anyone would assume from the commercialized system of entertainment, ""Gone Girl"" was developed into a motion picture. Flynn wisely adapted her own novel into the screenplay, and director David Fincher accepted the mission of satisfying the zealous fans of the novel. Thankfully, Fincher has been successful in making a movie that will permeate through cinemas just as the novel did through bookshelves.On their fifth wedding anniversary, Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) returns to their quiet suburban home in Missouri to find his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) has vanished from their home and the only clue left to her disappearance is a messy crime scene suggesting a struggle. Did Nick kill his wife? Is he holding her hostage? Was Amy murdered by someone else? If so, then by whom? These are the questions that plague police, reporters, and spectators when assessing Nick's apathetic attitude to the situation and the contradictory evidence that emerges.The first act of ""Gone Girl"" is told from two different perspectives: an objective view of Nick dealing with ramifications of Amy's disappearance and a subjective telling of the love story before Amy went missing, told from Amy's perspective via her diaries. The film functions sufficiently through this period, sometimes it even transcends, but the sharp turn ""Gone Girl"" takes in its second act discombobulates the viewer. Subsequently the film prospers. By act three, ""Gone Girl"" pushes every boundary imaginable, and the final turn of events will not abate from your mind for hours after leaving the cinema.Within the spear-edged twists of the screenplay lies a mordant stand on probing themes of husband and wife dynamics, marriage deceit, and the fabrication of ideas of being a ""celebrity."" One of Amy's first diary entries begins with Amy underlining this sentence: ""Marriage is hard work."" ""Gone Girl"" asks the question in the most extreme case scenario, do any of us truly know the person who sleeps next to us? The screenplay presents its leading characters in a reticent way, both guarded and unwilling to compromise. The strength of this approach supplies the film with depth because neither character is entirely sympathetic, both have their explicit flaws, and each are mired together in marital issues beyond repair.David Fincher directs ""Gone Girl"" with the same storytelling standard he has brought to ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,"" ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,"" ""The Social Network,"" ""Zodiac,"" and ""Se7en."" There is no question who made this film. Fincher's lark auteur touches are on maximum display in ""Gone Girl,"" and are just as crafty as ever. He adorns his take on the heralded novel with his typical, but ever so effective, scratching, toned score and somber darkly-lit cinematography.Everyone seeing ""Gone Girl"" is probably familiar with Ben Affleck in some capacity. He's swell as Nick Dunne. However, most people seeing ""Gone Girl"" are probably inexperienced with the British actress Rosamund Pike, but after seeing this film, everyone will know her name. Not only does she have one of the most tremendously written female characters in recent years, but she performs it without a blemish. Pike is eager to summon the terrifying Amy Dunne, and the product is a bravura piece of acting.If you have never taken any of my opinions on film seriously before, take this one. I plead that you see ""Gone Girl"" because it is a cinematic experience that needs to be lived. The echelon of talent from Fincher, Affleck, Pike, Flynn, Jeff Cronenweth, (the cinematographer), Kirk Baxter (the film editor), Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross (the composers) make this an inconceivably good film, which exceeds the established expectations of crime thrillers.* * * * / * * * *Grade: A",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Psychotic Perfection,"An excellent adaptation of the sensational novel, Gone Girl features Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike in career best performances, particularly Pike in a star making role. Fincher again proves he is among the best filmmakers of his generation.Affleck comes home one day to find his wife Pike has disappeared. There is a broken table, blood spots and a series of envelopes left by Pike for their anniversary treasure hunt. Of course, he is the prime suspect, and we spend most of the first half in flashback trying to figure out what's going on.Go in reading nothing, and you will be blown away. On rewatch it's even better. Everything from the acting, screenplay, cinematography and especially the score are at the highest level. Psychotic perfection 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

"That's a very ""clever"" movie!","First of all, when I first watched the official teaser of the movie I liked it and I had high expectations about it. Eventually, it was as good as I had imagined and I enjoyed it, a lot. The plot of the movie was very interesting and mysterious, but not innovative because there are many mystery movies similar to this one. The storyline was very clever, well-written, well-explained and innovative. The characters were very interesting, well-developed and kinda likeable. The casting choices were nice and their performances were excellent, especially Rosamund's acting. I have to admit, it was a very intense movie from start to finish and the plot twists were perfect. The opening scene was predictable and slow paced, but it was very promising. The 2nd act was very intense, mysterious and fast-paced. The ending reveal was definitely unpredictable, shocking and the twist was very well-explained. Overall, ""Gone Girl"" was an enjoyable mystery/thriller film, intense, breathtaking and I would definitely recommend it to anyone!",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Professionally Satisfied!,"There's is no denying that this is a good movie! I was really surprised at how the ending concluded. And even though it was a lengthy movie, the suspense and thrills made it easy to not go to sleep on. However, on a personal level, I hated the ending because it seems that the devil gets away with it, lol. I mean, I hate it when I watch films where the villain seems to get away it - it's these kind of endings that makes me want to see a part two. But then again, it made me question, ""who is really the villain here."" Having said that, it is pretty challenging for me to critic a film where the villain causes chaos and destruction, and just walks away like a hero. So here's my honest conclusion: this is an entertaining and fun movie to watch. If you haven't seen it already, please take a look and let me know what you think.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Marriages are Made in Heaven? Not in David Fincher's Universe!,"The problem with Gone Girl, David Fincher's first rate adaptation of Gillian Flynn's novel, is that there's relatively little one can say about the film's gnarly plot without giving away the twists. So I'll step lightly over the plot synopsis.On the day of his fifth wedding anniversary to Amy (Pike), Nick Dunne (Affleck) returns to their small-town Missouri home to find signs of a violent struggle and his wife missing. The police arrive on the ""bit-too-arranged"" crime scene to find specks of her blood, as the search fast gains national attention, with the media circus rolling into town in a frenzy of crass curiosity. The more the cops investigate, the worse it looks for Nick as his responses are unfairly interpreted as too cold to be genuine outpourings of grief. The noose is slowly tightening around Nick, who it turns out is harboring a few secrets of his own. Despite his best efforts to appear sympathetic in front of the cops, the cameras and the court of public opinion, Nick can't help coming off as insincere and smug. But a mid-film twist turns the movie from complex whodunit into a psychological thriller. The shift doesn't come entirely out of nowhere and in spite of the tonal shift, everything feels naturally derived, taking us from sympathy to revulsion and back again to sympathy for the central protagonist.Gone Girl bounces back and forth seamlessly from the investigation and the attendant media circus to the horrific dissolution of a fairy tale union. The audience is always kept one step ahead of the characters thanks to extracts from Amy's diaries and a series of flashbacks, which show that a once-idyllic marriage founded on sizzling mutual attraction has begun to flounder on acidic mutual disdain. The storyline itself is pure pulp – a twisting, lurid crime tale with uncannily familiar elements. But in the hands of an immaculate craftsman like Fincher, Gone Girl is a sleek work of art that polishes its literary source, leaving all of the story's vitriol and venom intact. The black humor of the film consistently bites as it spews bile all over the sanctity of marriage. Fincher orchestrates the drama beautifully, providing the film with a steady, unhurried pace that proves perversely effective as it starts to shred the audience's abraded nerves.The lead actors have a palpable chemistry that helps construct the narrative of two loving individuals crumbling under the weight of marital infidelity. Ben Affleck's self-conscious presence translates into an indispensable part of his character, imbuing Nick with an ambivalence that leaves us uncertain about whether we should be cheering or booing him, even when the narrative is ready to throw him to the wolves. Rosamund Pike leaves nothing behind, delving full throttle into an iconic performance as Amy. She uses her cool exterior to mask a seething lump of volatility - an intoxicating blend of slow burn and volcanic flash – that makes her an overwhelming presence. The supporting cast also delivers wonderfully realized performances.David Fincher's graceful cynicism proves to be the perfect channel for this comedic tale of moral decay that remains one of cinema's most supremely cynical statements about the institution of marriage.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Fincher is one of this decade's best director,The gone girl is one hell of a thriller movie which introduces us to one of the best sociopath(psycopath) heroine of all time.

A Cleverly Written Mystery,"Ben Affleck is Nick Dunne and Rosamund Pike is Amy Dunne in this story that is a mystery at times, a thriller at others. I love the way that the film's exposition leads the viewer to one conclusion, then another that is contrary to the first, then another. Eventually, the film becomes a commentary on public opinion and the media, even as it explores the complexities of an unusual marriage.The action starts with the disappearance of Amy, but the story evolves quickly. I have read other reviews that decry an abundance of plot holes, but I find most of them to be misunderstandings of the story. Others can be easily explained with some creative thinking. As a whole, the story is cleverly written.This film deserves its high score. The performances are strong, even in their moments of restraint. Rosamund Pike has cited Sharon Stone in ""Basic Instinct"" as an influence and it is noticeable in her sometimes measured manner. Ben Affleck, at times, reminds one of the prototypical Hitchcockian hero-victim.The Reznor and Ross soundtrack is atmospheric, giving the film a suspenseful, unresolved feeling.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Gone Girl is a cult film!,"""Gone Girl"" based on the 2012 novel of the same name, is a psychological thriller about a mysterious couple. Nick Dunne (played by Ben Affleck), who becomes the prime suspect in the sudden disappearance of his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike), is the primary plot of this movie. ""Gone Girl"" is one of the rarest movies I have experienced after a long time that has kept me at the edge of my seat. It confused me, shifted my perspective on the two main characters, and thrilled me with its taut screenplay.It was a critical and commercial success, grossing $369 million worldwide against a $61 million budget, to become Fincher's highest-grossing film. The film is now considered a cult classic.Pike's performance was widely acclaimed by critics, and she received nominations for an Academy Award, BAFTA Award, Golden Globe Award, and Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actress. Additional nominations included a Golden Globe Award for Best Director for Fincher and Golden Globe Award, BAFTA, and Critics' Choice Award nominations for Flynn's adapted screenplay, which won at Critics' Choice.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Love this film,"Two movies for the price of one.That's a fairly glib start to a review of a movie that I really liked, but it is true. The first half of Gone Girl is a fairly standard ""did he or didn't he"" mystery thriller. Then, about an hour in, the perspective shifts entirely and suddenly you realise that you're watching - perhaps - the most pitch-black comedy that you've ever seen.Despite the abrupt shift, I still think that Gone Girl holds together extremely well as one whole movie. Ben Affleck's Nick manages to inspire sympathy without ever being truly likable while Rosamund Pike's Amy (the star of the show in my opinion) is brilliant, terrifying, hilarious and despicable in various combinations and occasionally all at the same time.David Fincher's direction is both classy and clever (as usual) and several scenes are particularly outstanding due at least as much to his brilliance as that of the actors involved in them. My one complaint would be over the length - it really didn't need to be two and a quarter hours long. There were certainly a few moments, particularly in the first half, when I wished that the movie would hurry up and get to the point just a little more quickly.Gone Girl is a movie unlike any that I've ever seen before and as such largely defies further description. I would recommend this movie to all (with a warning that the adult rating is well earned) but especially those with a dark sense of humour. The darker the better.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

An excellent film ruined by its ending,"...No spoilers...I had heard good things about Gone Girl and was pleased to finally watch it. The film starts well and only gets better as the storyline progresses. There are twist and turns which constantly shift your opinions of and emotions toward the characters. I felt well and truly gripped - there was plenty of suspense, as well as moments which make you switch between being frustrated and calm.As the film approached the end I was thinking of awarding it a 9/10. It was very good. Unfortunately the ending completely ruined it for me. There were several ways in which it could have ended. I personally was hoping it would finish in the way I am sure almost everybody who watches it would want it to go. Even a more open ending would have also been acceptable, however instead it went in an incredibly annoying closed way. Such an annoying way in fact that I now never want to see the film again because I know I will spend the whole film remembering how let down I felt at the end. It was not just that it ended not in the way I hoped, it was also that the ending they chose had several flaws in it.Overall, this is a film which could have been great (and for that reason I won't be too harsh on the rating front), however it was completely and utterly spoiled by the last few minutes. It is well worth a watch, as long as you turn it off ten minutes before the end.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

"A well crafted, authentic adaptation of a fun, twisting thriller","Gone Girl is one of the more authentic adaptations I've seen, along with Silence of the Lambs. Both make small changes to better suit the film medium but capture the all key plot points and more importantly, the tone and intention of the novel. The plot is pulpy and nothing exceptional in Gone Girl, but the way the story unfolds and the details you learn about the characters still makes it quite satisfying. The book is great for all the small details that make the characters feel so realistic and that you can understand their psychology, and the movie here does a fantastic job of translating those nuances into the characters and tone via strong performances and excellent direction from Fincher. Pike is a standout and scene stealer, and the movie truly rests on her ability to effectively convey Amy's psychology. She's fantastic - if anything, I wish Fincher had spent more time with her and given more details about her mindset, especially how she really felt early in the marriage, but it still works as her presence is rarely on screen but often felt. The third act in the movie did seem to sacrifice a bit of the psychological delving that I love most about the movie in favor of hitting the plot points and twists efficiently, but even then it's all so well crafted (especially the one bloody scene in the movie) that I was engaged the whole time. Very well done, great watch if you haven't read the book but also really satisfying as it captures the essence of the book and translates it to the screen seamlessly.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Fincher versus genre,"David Fincher is a skilful director, and his 'Gone Girl' is compulsively watchable. But the movie ultimately comes up against the limitations of its own genre. It's not so much a satire (which paints an exagerated portrait of the world out of righteous anger at how things really are) but rather a piece of gleeful cynicism, a tale of horrid human beings each trying to ensnare the others in their plot. As such, it reminded me slightly of Tom Wolfe's famous novel, 'The Bonfire of the Vanities', but without the associated social commentary; there's potentially interesting material in the strange life of its female protagonist, but the film ultimately reduces her to a straight pyschopath, which to me at least is not so interesting. The ending is also a bit anticlimactic, as if the story is one trick short of a full house. I enjoyed it anyway, but Fincher has definitely done more stimulating work elsewhere.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Affleck is stupendous. His ability to demonstrate a range of emotions while sprinkling in the occasional dry, hilarious witticism is perfectly done here. Neil Patrick Harris is spot on and so effectively defies his Barney-type performance to become something serious and even creepy is wonderful. And Tyler Perry, ladies and gentlemen!

"Excellent acting, suspense, and certainly kept me guessing.","( This is being written in my 'simpleton mode' because I was typing all day before watching this film, but hope the points get across:)The acting was awesome. The sets were true to life. The main actress played a great psychopath. As a musician/composer I strangely enough did not notice the music. That means either it was dull or it was so good at seeming together the moods of the film that it went past the ears straight into my subconscious mind.Now as far as the story line goes, I felt the lack of any images of his wife on all of the media coverage was unrealistic and it seemed to lessen the chance that the girl she befriended at the hotel would ever connect the dots and rat her out. The film reminded me of how much I really hate mainstream media and Nancy Grace. Living out of any spotlight has been a real privilege. People shouldn't wish for such icky things. The last 30 minutes could have played out in any of a number of ways. One of which I would have taken (too?). I can't say, that would be a spoiler;) Bottom line, the film was a very good suspense thriller that kept me captivated. By that last 20 minutes the I think just about any viewer would feel they were being shown a top notch movie simply because of the awesome acting.

Unraveling Deception,"David Fincher's ""Gone Girl"" is a chilling exploration of marriage, manipulation, and media sensationalism that leaves audiences on the edge of their seats from start to finish. Adapted from Gillian Flynn's bestselling novel, the film masterfully navigates the twists and turns of its complex narrative, keeping viewers guessing until the very end.At its core, ""Gone Girl"" is a psychological thriller that delves into the dark underbelly of domestic life. Fincher's direction is taut and suspenseful, as he skillfully ratchets up the tension with each passing scene. The film's non-linear structure adds an extra layer of intrigue, inviting viewers to piece together the puzzle of what really happened to Amy Dunne, portrayed with icy perfection by Rosamund Pike.Thematically, ""Gone Girl"" explores the facade of perfection that masks the flaws and fractures lurking beneath the surface of seemingly idyllic relationships. Through its sharp satire of media sensationalism and public perception, the film offers a scathing commentary on the nature of modern marriage and the toxic dynamics that can emerge within it.Central to the film's success are the powerhouse performances of Pike and Ben Affleck as Amy's husband Nick. Pike delivers a career-defining performance as the enigmatic Amy, oscillating between vulnerability and manipulation with chilling precision. Affleck, meanwhile, imbues Nick with a sense of ambiguity and unease, keeping viewers guessing about his true motives until the very end.But perhaps the most impressive aspect of ""Gone Girl"" is its ability to subvert expectations and defy genre conventions. Just when viewers think they have the story figured out, Fincher throws a curveball that upends everything they thought they knew. It's this willingness to take risks and challenge audience perceptions that sets ""Gone Girl"" apart as a truly unforgettable cinematic experience.In conclusion, ""Gone Girl"" is a gripping and provocative thriller that gets under your skin and stays with you long after the credits roll. With its razor-sharp writing, impeccable direction, and powerhouse performances, it's a film that demands to be seen and discussed. A modern masterpiece of suspense that will leave you questioning everything you thought you knew about love, loyalty, and deception.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Comes close to the book's brilliance--and that's a big compliment.,"They were never going to pull off the *exact* same feeling and depth of the book, as many narrative devices used in the book are impossible to translate to film. What David Fincher and Gillian Flynn came up with, however, is a close second.The story of Nick and Amy Dunne could not have found a better director or cast. Then they had Gillian Flynn, the original author, pen the screenplay. Boom. Yes. That's how it needed to be done. All aces so far.Much of the plot's aspects and details were included, even if they are rearranged and adjusted for the film's benefit. The most satisfying survivor of the transition is the now infamous Cool Girl speech played over THE pivotal moment in the story--possibly the part in the film that gets the closest to the thrill of the novel.Where there thematic arguments, points, and plot developments missing? Of course. Did I miss them? Of course. There were a couple of huge things missing that changes the DNA of the story a little too much, rendering it less gut-punching than the book. I'd tell you what they are, but in the world of Gone Girl almost *everything* is a spoiler.A vital element of the book is just how relentlessly thorough it is--the narrative doesn't stop until every single point is made with brutal accuracy. So in contrast, a movie version will inevitably feel truncated, or like a ""best of"" montage. That's why I HIGHLY RECOMMEND reading the book first, waiting a few weeks, and then watching the movie. That will be the most satisfying way to experience this insane, razor-sharp story.Ultimately, this should have been a mini-series. But what they managed in a 2 1/2 hour film was remarkable.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Nick and Amy are a perfect match.,"Nick's sister does not understand why he can still live with such a terrible woman. She won't understand.
I remember chatting with my friends once and talking about the bottom line of marriage. I thought about it, there is no universal bottom line, the bottom line of marriage is the bottom line of each other. When you pay for a marriage, you pay for each other's bottom line.

""" My man could kill me "". One of the best thriller of the decade.","Rosamund Pike is outstanding, Ben Affleck's great and Fincher's directing is masterful.

I really liked it but...that ending sucked,"Didn't know what to expect as I somehow missed this film when it came out but I ended up really enjoying it. Good plot twist as well and it was interesting to see where it was going to go. However, I thought the ending was worthless and ended up ruining something great. There could have been more to it but it ended up with a rushed conclusion like they ran out of time and ends up just sucking and leaves you disappointed thinking ""really that's it?"".

A great and realistic movie,"The movie was very very good, the best part of this movie was that it showed how much can the reality of a news be different from what we see in the media! It also said that we shouldn't trust a woman just because she is a woman. No one trusts a stranger enough to let him come into his house and give him all the information but when the stranger is a woman and she's hot, men trust easily and that's stupid.Anyway, I suggest you watch this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Tightly made, slow to get going but then it gets going in classic thriller fashion","Gone Girl (2014)First a warning—don't read any (ANY) reviews about this movie unless you want to have at least a little of the plot surprises ruined. I've tried hard to not say too much here, but it's impossible to be perfect. Read on, here and elsewhere, with caution.On the surface, ""Gone Girl"" is a common thriller formula. A husband and wife are having a tense time of it, one of them seems to have committed a crime, the main character seems to be wrongly accused. And then some facts pop up in the wrong places and the story gets more creepy and complicated. This is what thrillers do—set up a murder, set up a likely perp, have the facts lead us in circles through lots of spooky territory.On those terms this is fairly straight up story-telling. Yes, there is a sort of big twist an hour into the film, though you see it coming. But there are bigger twists in better thrillers. And yes there is some chilling psychology at play, both with the leading man, Ben Affleck, who plays a very regular guy with almost too much regularness (he's sometimes a bore), and with the leading woman, Rosamund Pike, who keeps it in check beautifully.So what does actually make this movie hum along so well, once it gets going? The filmmaking. The formal, technical aspects of a movie make it good, in that slick David Fincher way (remember ""Fight Club"" above all). Transpose this plot into a film noir setting with sparse, contrasty black and white and much faster editing and, well, you have a better movie, perhaps. But you have the same result—a movie that uses drama in the camera, editing, and sound to propel the twisty plot.There are some good commentaries out there about the roles the men and women get, and how they reflect on society. There is the chief detective, a smart and wily woman without the coy maternal edge of McDormand in ""Fargo."" There is the African- American lawyer who lights up every scene (this is none other than Tyler Perry, and he's great) and who is maybe the only one who gets what's going on outside of the couple themselves. And there is the wife, about whom I can say nothing.So, yeah, get past the opening half hour which is kludgey and slow. Smell the quickening plot in the second half hour, and then hold on for the real stuff, the final three half hours as the conflicts actually clash and cause smoke and fire. To call this a post-modern thriller that wears its clichés proudly on its sleeve might be an excuse for using so many clichés, but it's all well done, very well done. See it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
The Worst Hitchcock Film I've Ever Seen,"This film wanted so bad to be a Hitchcock film, I thought I was going to see Ben Affleck in a dress by the end of it. Not that I'd want to, and thankfully I didn't have to endure it. However I did have to endure this painfully bad film nonetheless, seeing as how I went to see it at the theatre with friends. Anyway, calling this film the worst Hitchcock film I've ever seen is about as much praise as it's going to get out of me. Nearly every scene in this film seemed overly forced and ridiculous to me. The entire film felt like a sarcastic farce, as if the filmmakers themselves felt their audiences were just a bunch of morons when they made this crapper. Maybe they are right for the most part, judging by the ratings on here. Oh well, each to their own. If you liked it, you liked it and good for you. I for one felt it was one of the worst big budget mainstream thrillers I've ever seen, in fact, maybe THE worst! I was wishing I conned my friends into going to see The Judge during and after watching this garbage. Honestly, what separates this film from your average Lifetime movie? Not much, slightly better acting and much better cinematography, that's about it. I couldn't wait for this overly long and incredibly dumb film to end. It seemed for a while as if it never was going to end, and I was stuck in some sort of movie hell. Don't waste your time. 2/10",2.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Disgusting great movie,"The acting is superb (especially from Rosamund Pike), the story awesome and twisted and thrilling, and the dialogue, while not that realistic, it is quite beautiful. Poetic? Maybe. I love it. Also, the characters are really complex. I was engaged by all their stories and lives.But, I was disgusted by how they approached this story. It reverses the reality and turns our sympathy towards the other side, begging us to understand how unfair this stories usually go in real life. And that's just perverse, knowing (as the creators all should) how big the problem really is, how difficult is to fight back to make it better, and how rare is the occasion were the problem wasn't more than an scam/lie from one side to victimize itself.But even in disgust, I can't deny how good the movie was.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A brilliant crime thriller that keeps your eyes fixed on the screen.,"""Gone Girl"" Is directed by ""David Fincher"".It stars Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike, Tyler Perry, Neil Patrick Harris, Carrie Coon and Emily Ratajowski.""Gone Girl"" follows 'Nick Dunne"" who's life Is turned upside down when his wife ""Amy"" goes missing. With her disappearance making headlines across America, ""Nick"" Is being targeted by the media and some think he killed his wife. Knowing that he didn't do It, ""Nick"" goes to find his wife with the help of his sister and try and get the media and police off his back.I'm a fan of crime and thriller movies. So I was Interested In watching this film. I thought It would be good as ""David Fincher"" Is one of my favourite directors working today. Nut this film not only met my expectations, It surpassed them by a million miles.The positivesFirst of all, the plot Is brilliant In this film. I wont spoil It as I feel you'll love this film and understand where I'm coming from If you watch It. This film had so many twists and surprises that my mouth was wide open for large portions of the film. Every time you think you know what will happen Is suddenly not what happens. I saw other reviews of this film and noticed people didn't like the ending. For me the ending Is perfect. My mouth was wide open and I was shocked to the core with what had happened. This film Is watchable from minute one. It's perfectly paced and no scene felt out of place. The camerawork and editing of this film Is brilliant. Not only does the film look amazing, but the camerawork on display Is brilliant. There is not a single shot In the film that looks bad. There's so many long takes In the film which look great and when cuts do happen, they're perfectly paced. The colour pallet to the lighting Is great and It fits the movies tone. From a story and visual side of things, It's perfect. The acting Is great In this film from near enough everyone. ""Ben Affleck"" gives one of his career best performances. ""Rosamund Pike"" Is a great actress and she gives another brilliant performance. ""Tyler Perry"" Is an actor I'm not a fan of. But he's actually great In the film. Overall the acting was fantastic. The music Is genius. It's eerie and creepy which not only fits the tone but also enhances It. Even when the score plays over the studios logo, I loved It. It Invested me within two seconds. When you hear It at the end In complete silence, I was shivering. This film also Isn't afraid to make the characters unlikeable In their own ways. I won't spoil why but It's great that we can route for any of the characters. They all have plenty of flaws and positives which makes It hard for the audience to take the side of just one character. Usually, In these sort of films, you would always route for the person trying to find the missing person, but you can't do that with this film. You could have an entire debate on why you are on the side of this character and against the other. But this film also does send messages on how media presents news stories and how the news overexaggerates stories. It's great how the film says when you watch a news broadcast, just keep In mind there maybe something you don't know about which the media does not want you to know as they know It wont make a big story.The negativesThere's only a couple of negatives I have with the film. First of all, no disrespect to ""Neil Patrick Harris' but he was miscast as the character of ""Desi Collings"". I think he's a great actor and he tried really hard In this film but he just did not fit the role at all. He tried to be a smirky sort of person and he just didn't make It look convincing unfortunately. There's also a small nit-pick which will spoil things if I talk about It but It involves a friend and a toilet and that's all I can say without spoiling. Finally, there's loads of paparazzi pretty much every time ""Nick"" goes out and he's followed around a lot. But when he goes to a very public place In the middle of the film, not even a pedestrian starts trying to ask him questions. It just took away some of the realism away unfortunately.Conclusion""Gone Girl"" Is a great piece of cinema. Apart from one miscast actor and a couple of nit-picks. It's perfect. A great plot, a great message about the media, brilliant acting, beautiful camerawork and editing, spine-chilling music, twists that make your mouth drop, a shocking ending and character's that are Interesting make 'Gone Girl"" a film that needs to be watched.I'm going to give ""Gone Girl"" a:9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
This is a classic thriller,"One part disturbing. One part psychological thriller. One part Scott Peterson case. Throw in a little Basic Instinct and Fatal Attraction.

Rosamund Pike was a GEM, oozing with appeal yet conveys a terrifying presence, truly worthy of the Oscar nod. Ben Affleck did justice in his portrayal of Nick. Overall, what a success in the realm of book adaptations, a guaranteed place in the top 5 films of the year.

"Good film but too long, poorly edited","I have not read the book, M'Lady has.We both felt like we'd endured over 2-1/2hrs. IMDb says runtime is 1hr49min & another site lists it at 2hr20min. It felt like the latter.We agreed that with better editing the film could be about 15min shorter with nothing lost. Parts of the film were just too slow.I felt that about 25 min could have been cut from the middle with 5- 10min added to the end for a little more depth. Things wrapped up a little too ""neatly,"" as though the Director realized he'd stretched things out too long already.I found the story fascinating & M'Lady felt it was true to the book.In summary, a good movie that generates a lot of discussion afterward but it could have been tighter, moved along a bit faster & shorter.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Iv Seen Better Reviews for the Expendables 3,"I don't review movies often but after seeing the horrible reviews people gave this movie I had to say something. It is not near as bad as people say.

Beautiful and intense Thriller with best career performance by Rosamund Pike,"This movie kept me glued to my seat from the first moment until the last. Cinematography is great as well as the complex and articulate story which goes back and forth with narration in such an Interesting way and is told perfectly. Pike is so perfect for the role, as her psychology remains such a mistery througout the whole story. I really enjoyed this movie as you can see by the rating that I gave it, If I must say one thing that diden't convince me 100%, it has to be Ben Affleck acting, which, at times seems a bit uptight and not really natural considering the circumstances that he encounters himself in, but again, really great movie all together.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Gone Girl (2014),"Directed by David Fincher. Starring Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike, Carrie Coon, Kim Dickens, Neil Patrick Harris, Tyler Perry, Patrick Fugit, Lola Kirke, Emily Ratajkowski, Boyd Holbrook, Lisa Banes, David Clennon, Sela Ward, Missi Pyle. (R)When his ""amazing"" wife (Pike) disappears, aloof husband Affleck is suspected of murder, unleashing a media firestorm that captivates the community and nation at large, but truly not all is what it seems. Ice cold yet blistered in scorch marks, director Fincher does what he does best: an elegantly stylish, meticulously-crafted thriller that looks phenomenal, frame after frame, serving every dark impulse and lunatic intent, paired well with an unnerving score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross that provides false reassurance. Gillian Flynn's adaptation of her own best-seller is a hysterical dark comedy, serpentine mystery, trashy potboiler, and sinister study of sociopathy all rolled into one; can't withstand much scrutiny, but many of those plot holes (particularly toward the end) actually serve the satirical calculations of its macabre delight. Every role is perfectly cast (yes, even Perry), with Affleck and Pike delivering exactly what's needed for their unforgettable lead roles, so very deserving of each other despite not belonging within 500 yards of one another--to be a fly on the wall... Calmly torpedoes any politically correct notion of misogyny, misandry, militant feminism, revenge fantasy, etc., but is still bound to upset those who demand rectitude in their lurid fiction, which makes it all the more ingeniously unsettling.89/100",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Ben Affleck seemingly plays himself in this master piece,If you haven't seen this film then make it your next movie night. The book is so good it handed the producers this amazing story and they pulled it off perfectly.Ben Affleck basically plays himself. I believe his ex wife said that he makes you feel as though the sun is shining on you...but then it's very dark when he takes the sun away. That said I also assume Scott Peterson was his muse for this role because the portrayal is uncanny.Rosamund Pike steals the show. The dialogue in this film is brilliant and she carries it well. Of course giving the famous 'Cool girl' speech. Whilst her character does some questionable things you can't help but root for her as she represents the frustrations of many women.,9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Gone Girl is a decent thriller.,"Thrilling and disturbing. By far, David Fincher's best movie. Intertwined with disturbing appearances of the main characters, the movie is filled with odd occurrences and dark comedy. It contains enough suspense and mystery to keep the audience gripping at the edge of their seats. The movie is about a former writer Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) and his glamorous wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) who present themselves as a lovely, endearing couple to the public. However, the image of their perfect union is shattered when Nick's wife goes missing on their fifth wedding anniversary and Nick becomes the primary suspect of her disappearance. This description of plot might not sound interesting but the twist is that the wife, Amy has planned her disappearance and has left clues for the police in order to framing her husband for her disappearance because he was unfaithful and cheated on her with another woman. In the end, the police find Amy and the couple surprisingly stay together. However, the couple does not stay together but because Amy has once again cunningly forced Nick into staying. Nick know he has no choice but to continue this relationship and maintain his faithfulness in order to protect his child from the child's mother, Amy. In this movie, Ben Affleck takes on the role of a man with a serious personality like he normally does and does an excellent job with executing his role. However, Rosamund Pike did an even better job at executing her role. She had a hard job. Rosamund Pike had to step out of her comfort zone and play the role of a cunning yet crazy woman, an interesting combination, which she took on magnificently. In addition, the combination of the eerie music and dark lighting at certain scenes throughout the movie provided an intense, suspenseful atmosphere. With the actors' fantastic acting skills and Fincher's incredible cinematic skills, the story of the dysfunction couple's love and communication magically comes to life. I would recommend this movie to someone that is looking for an exciting thriller who is not afraid of disturbing content and concepts.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
The distance between a cool girl and a gone girl is called marriage.,"Have read both novels and movies. Because of the relationship between the text, the novel is more in-depth in the excavation of characters. But in a limited space, the film also beautifully narrated a twists and turns story, layer by layer interlocking. As a film with twists and turns in the novel, some of the concepts are very interesting, especially the psychological description in the novel extends these concepts and raises many challenging questions about marriage and love.1, Cool GirlThere is a slight difference between Eastern and Western cultures, but in general, men like a creature called ""cool girl"". In addition to the basic hardware such as hot face Peugeot, Cool girl is such a creature. They can wear team uniforms to watch the ball game with boys, stuff pizza burgers in their mouths, but never worry about not wearing small clothes. They are smart, funny and humorous, and always have a big smile on their faces. They will not be jealous because their boyfriends talk to other girls and laugh, and they fully understand that men miss their appointments because of their buddies' parties. Cool girl won't nag, she knows when to be silent and should give her boyfriend his own space. She will not make unreasonable demands, nor will she interfere with each other.The man version corresponding to Cool girl is a precious variety called ""Prince Charming"", which is more common in various chicken movies and Korean dramas. Of course, in addition to the most basic equipment such as a tall figure and a white tooth, each of which reflects a gentle light, the white horse princes also have to observe the smallness of the heroines year-round like a 24-hour convenience store. Thoughts, other women's legs are longer than you, chest is bigger than you, face is bigger than you, they are all considered dung. He remembers every trivial or even the holiday anniversary outside Mars. The heroine saw a fish pond, a real estate, a small park or something. The heroine would overbearingly say, ""This piece of xx, I will contract for you (buy / Title)! ""What is Prince Charming? Do you think it's enough to send a designer bag? There must also be a matching wallet inside. Do you think a wallet is enough? Inside, you have to put in a variety of platinum VIP cards and enough cash!Regardless of whether Cool Girl and Prince Charming actually exist, at least many of us know how to perform mimicry and adapt to the jungle rules of gender relations. Just like Amy. The clever Amy saw Nick at first glance and knew that he liked ""Cool girl"", so like many other clever girls, she decided to enter the ""cool girl"" mode.2. Good love makes each other a better personThis is a sentence I have always believed before. But after watching ""gone girl"", I can't help but think, what if this better person is not you? What if you are just performing this better person and meeting the expectations of each other?
Just like the initial relationship between Amy and Nick, each of them is playing the role that the other person wants. Although they also get a lot of satisfaction and happiness from playing, deep down, they always know that it is not themselves. So when the mask of the play appeared cracked, and the true face under the mask appeared, their marriage was in trouble.
This is the essence of this book and this movie. When there is a gap between reality and expectation, where will marriage be based.Unemployed because of the financial crisis, tired Nick has no intention to cooperate with Amy's expectations, and Amy has decided to show his true personality because of Nick's decadence. The real she disgusted Nick. This is where Amy is really angry. He loves the ""cool girl"" she played, not her. This is a huge injury to her self-esteem.Her revenge is very interesting. At first she decided to frame him for murder, but halfway through, her mind changed. She found that she had inspired the Nick when she first met-no, or even better-which excites her and makes her feel that there is hope for the marriage between them to continue, as long as both of them return to their original Role-playing. Even Nick himself said after completing the touching interview, ""She brought out my best.""3. Unconditional loveUnconditional love, is this a wish that is too extravagant? Even Amy's own parents can't give her. For them, she is the prototype of Amazing Amy, the incomplete product that all failures need to make Amazing Amy complete. If we let our parents down, do they still love us? Is the same level of love? Have you even loved the part where we failed?Unconditional love. This is what Amy and all women like Amy expect from the other half. It is also what we think we can get from the family. But what kind of existence is it? Is it because of love, so love all the dark side of all your shortcomings together? Or because you love your strengths, can you tolerate your tolerable shortcomings? If it is the latter, if one day finds a flaw that is too large to contain, is love still there?Amy didn't get unconditional love from her parents, so she hopes to get it from the family she formed. In the book, she writes, shouldn't marriage love each other unconditionally? When she didn't get it, she decided to punish him.4. The bottom line of marriageThe ending is really sad. This is more sad than all life and death. It seems that the way to continue a marriage is that you have to wear a mask to perform.But the marriage in the world is really different, isn't it?Nick's sister doesn't understand why he can still live with such a terrible woman. She won't understand.
I remember chatting with my friends once and talking about the bottom line of marriage. I thought about it, there is no universal bottom line, the bottom line of marriage is the bottom line of each other. When you pay for a marriage, you pay for each other's bottom line.
From this point of view, Nick and Amy are a perfect match.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

A Pot Boiler by Any Other Name....,"I've decided that David Fincher as a director is only as good as his writers. All of his movies look and move the same. They're all dreary grays and browns and each one gives the impression that Fincher is striving to make The Great American Movie whether or not the subject matter warrants. It falls, then, to his writers to distinguish one of his movies from the next, and if there is any playfulness or humour in a Fincher film, it's not because he put it there.I haven't read ""Gone Girl,"" but since the screenplay is by the same woman who wrote the book, I trust that the film is fairly faithful both in story and tone to the story on which it is based. In that case, it's a crock of hooey masquerading as a serious work of art, a pot boiler that pretends to have something to say. Indeed, I've heard that Gillian Flynn intended for her book to be a commentary on modern marriage, to which I say, HA!""Gone Girl"" is entertaining enough while you're watching it, but the thing completely unravels as soon as you start thinking about it afterwards. It's all about plot and nothing about character. To a certain extent, Flynn has made her story critic proof, because the lead female character, played well by Rosamund Pike, is just flat-out insane, which means she doesn't have to be consistent and her motives don't have to be plausibly explained, because the explanation is ""Hey, she's crazy!"" Makes for a convenient narrative device but isn't especially interesting as a central character. Ben Affleck fades into the background, proving once again that he's far more interesting behind the camera than in front of it.Don't get me wrong, I actually enjoyed ""Gone Girl"" for what it was but didn't give it an once more credit than it deserved. And the ratings here at IMDb at the time of this review!! The 86th best movie of all time? Give me a break.

"Good, but not great.","Ben. Oh, Ben. We loved you and Matt for Goodwill. And yet, we can't forgive your for Gigli. There can be no two diametrically opposed movies ever. Gone Baby Gone was good, but not great, as Gone Girl is. We sit and wait for the action, the greatness, the imperious glorious abandon to come, and we are still waiting as the credits roll up the screen. What does this mean? It means Ben Affleck is no Martin Scorsese, no Robert Altman and no Steven Spielberg. No, he is mix between Eli Roth and Quentin Tarantino, always falling painfully short of greatness. It is no wonder Jenner Garner wants to divorce him. And yet, there is a Hitchcockian flare underscoring his work, which to me shows great promise, great potential, that could eventually culminate into something as brilliant as ""Strangers On A Train."" Perhaps the problem is that Ben just needs to ""Let himself go,"" trust in the force (instead of his producers) and man-up and grow some balls and unleash his true creative vision upon us.

Trash But Entertaining Trash,"!!!!!!! SUGGESTIVE SPOILERS !!!!!!I notice a lot of people are saying this is our generation's equivalent of FATAL ATTRACTION and I guess the trailers emphasised this a bit with a deranged blond woman as an antagonist . Based on a novel by Gillian Flynn I was reminded of a novel by Sean French called SECRET SMILE which was turned in to a ITV teleplay starring David Tennant just as he was embarking in his role of The Doctor in 2005 . I thought SECRET SMILE was an incredibly daft ,trashy , crime melodrama . . Considering both stories had a very similar premise I have the opinion that GONE GIRL is also an incredibly daft , trashy crime melodrama but one that's far more entertaining than it has any right to beI've never been a great fan of David Fincher . He does make good movies but I don't think he's made a truly great movie but GONE GIRL does show he's quite good at what he does . Ben Affleck is merely okay which is a backhanded compliment because he's one of those actors that I'm constantly puzzled as to how he became such a star and normally can't stand him . English rose Rosamund Pike who will probably be little known stateside is an absolute revelation as American housewife Amy Dunne a woman whose personality disorder manifests itself as misandry and goes about trying to frame her husband for her own murder and the performance is Oscar nomination worthy . For me however the star of the movie is the soundtrack by Reznor and Ross involving a sort of fusion between classic , industrial and techno beat . There's an absolutely stand out scene about halfway through where Amy gives a long monologue in voice over as to how she conceived her plan and the use of music is compelling and hypnotic and might just be my favourite soundtrack from recent cinemaDespite all this you need a great screenplay in order to make a great film and here GONE GIRL falls down slightly . I've never read the source novel so don't know how faithfully it has been adapted for screen but there is a massive plot turn towards the end that I found rather jarring almost as though the plot realises it has painted itself in to a very small corner and needs a way to wrap up the story . That said the ending is somewhat ambiguous and we're are left with the feeling perhaps Amy hasn't got away with . Her plan however would never have worked in real life but I suppose you're not supposed to give too much thought as to the plot mechanics and sit back and enjoy the ride which as trashy entertainment succeeds very well",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Wonderful, thrilling film with a disappointing and anti-climatic ending.","As the title says, this film is a wild ride from start to the end credits.

No more writing. The end.""There's no clever hints or suggestions as to what might happen beyond the great 'what ifs' - just a sadly unsatisfying gaping hole and scrolling credits.I would 100% recommend watching the film for the thrill, the acting, the storytelling and the drama.

Great Movie,"It's insulting that this film was only nominated for a single academy award. Gone Girl is able to take the plot of its movie which is tragic as is and spiral it out of control to the point of no return for the characters. The performances were all fantastic and Rosamund Pike was very well deserving of her nomination for best actress. Sadly the reason this doesn't fall under the category of a Perfect Movie for me is because of Neil Patrick-Harris' performance, whenever he was on screen I was taken out of the movie a bit, he should stick to comedies. But overall Gone Girl is a fantastic movie that I'd recommend to anyone who appreciates a good film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Very good and almost great,"One day Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) comes home from running his bar to find what looks like a break-in in his house and his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) missing. Quickly the police start up a search for her asking people to help. Then we see flashbacks to how Nick and Amy met and how their marriage was slowly unraveling. Then people start suspecting Nick. Did he or didn't he?Very good movie. The story is interesting and always keeps you guessing. It's long (2 and 1/2 hours) and slow but I was never bored. The acting is great. Affleck and Pike are both incredible in their roles. There's strong support by Carrie Coon (as Margo, Nick's sister), Kim Dickens (as a police detective) and Tyler Perry (as a lawyer). The only acting debit is from Neil Patrick Harris who's terrible. The only problem is the ending. It's TERRIBLE! It doesn't really end--it just stops leaving plenty of unresolved questions and plot lines. That really hurts the film as a whole. Still I recommend it.BTW there is no full frontal shot of Affleck. He appears to be totally nude in one scene but nothing is shown. You get a brief side glimpse and that's it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"""We have each other. Everything else is background noise.""","The idea is great and well developed. At first glance, it seems predictable, but in fact, it is not. It has unexpected... not exactly twists or turnovers, let's say unexpected situation development. Unfortunately, in a manner of many movies these days, a fantastic 90 minutes story was stretched and raped to 150 minutes and the final blow to the quality of this movie inflicts Ben Affleck who is lousy by default. I never saw a movie where Affleck gives a stunning performance and even my favorite ""Chasing Amy"" is partially ruined by his sleaziness. All in all, replace Affleck and cut it under 2 hours and you'll get strong 9/10. But this way... 7, maybe7,5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Fincher and Co. deliver once again...Brilliant,"Bringing Gone Girl to the big screen is a balancing act that only David Fincher could handle. Those familiar with the book, which starts out as a portrait of a seemingly perfect marriage and quickly turns into a literary trip down the Autobahn, will not be disappointed. Fincher, working from a script adapted by Gillian Flynn, weaves through every twist and turn with ease, helped along the way by a beautiful, yet subtle score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. The end result, a two and a half hour ticking time bomb dropped in your lap that you can't wait to explode. Once again, Fincher delivers a dark, twisted vision that is a perfect mix of all of his films, rolled tightly into one violent little package.Gone Girl is the story of a decaying marriage, told through flashbacks, diary entries and interrogation rooms, where nothing is what it seems. Fincher, one of the most meticulous directors around, perfectly carves out each act like an ice sculpture, and then runs a chainsaw right through the center when you least expect it. Even reading the book and knowing what happens, I still sat there in shock at those ""holy sh*t"" moments. I can only imagine how it feels to see these scenes unravel for the first time.The ""Benaissance"" is in full swing with Affleck as Nick Dunne, a role that no other actor in Hollywood could've done better. The entire casting is perfect, and it almost seems like Gillian Flynn wrote the book with these actors in mind. Nick's twin sister, Margo Dunne, is played by the Leftover's Carrie Coon, who continues her red hot year. Tyler Perry as hot shot lawyer Tanner Bolt was my only question mark going in, but he shut me right up. Neil Patrick Harris is as creepy as ever as Desi Collings, and even the underrated Scoot Mcnairy shines in his single scene as a boyfriend from Amy's past. But without question, the true star of this movie is Rosamund Pike, who is nothing short of ""amazing"", as Amy Elliot-Dunne. Amy is a) the titular character from a series of successful children's books, b) the loving, ""cool girl"" wife, c) a crazy bitch, or d) all, and none, of the above? Either way, she absolutely shines, especially in the major moments of the second and third acts.Gone Girl paces itself brilliantly, and the way Fincher and Co. depict the twists is a thing of beauty. Everyone involved with this movie seems like a lock come award season, although the subject matter might be a bit much for some voters. Regardless, this is easily one of the best movies of the year so far, and it's sure to stick with you for days after viewing it. Gone Girl fires on all cylinders, even though it has one of the more depressing endings in recent memory. Just like anything Fincher touches, this is a must see, and in my opinion, it very well might be his best work to date.For more reviews, check out EnterTheMindOfMadness.tumblr.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A ingenious movie that leaves you thinking if humans can be humane at all,"I am more of a science-fiction person that watches movies mostly for their effects and massive scenes.

The plot is so well thought that you get the ""aha"" and ""so that's what happened"" moments every few minutes, but it is apparent enough to let the viewer intelligent enough to guess some of the scenes, just so they get astonished with the next one.The movie leaves the viewer with the impression that there is a good/bad guy plot in the movie until the very end when the scenario twists again and leaves the viewer astonished and questioning if there's a bad character at all and what would they do in the characters' place.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

thelittledoorreview.com,"Review of the film Gone Girl The film adaptation of Gillian Flynn's best-selling novel Gone Girl comes across the screen with an eerie stillness that elevates from the very first moment where Nick Dunne, played adeptly by Ben Affleck, stands at the curb of his suburban home taking in the silent Missouri morning. It is an unforgettable beginning, one that comes to mind abruptly late in the film when the chaos has come full circle, and Nick is standing at the exact same spot in the early morning, except this time the curb is lined with television trucks.Gone Girl is more than just your typical murder mystery. At its heart is the concerns of relationships, specifically marriages, and the way in which people tend to eat away at one another, trying to devour the significant other with questions that seem to load the burden of reciprocity: What are you thinking, Amy? Who are you? What have we done to each other? What will we do? The questions not only imply the insecurities of relationships, the need to discover in someone else what you can't seem to find in yourself, but they foreshadow the major themes of the movie as well: the inability to truly know someone or to convey yourself to somebody else, the inevitable burdening of apprehensions onto the significant other, and the hope that a significant other can alleviate the itinerant loneliness that comes with life. The central conflict is a nail-biting spin-off of how far people are willing to go to make the person you once loved suffer mixed with how far are you willing to go to make it last.On the morning of their fifth wedding anniversary Amy Dunne goes missing, and the actions of Nick Dunne call into question his relationship with his wife, making him the obvious suspect. He is seen smiling in photos, his features are smug and somewhat emotionless, except to reveal the occasional self-awareness that he is good looking, a sweet heart in the heartland, and he does not seem to be overly concerned with his wife's absence, as if he believes it is some big hoax, his wife just trashed the living room and took off.The film oscillates between ""the day of"" Amy's disappearance as it progresses forward, to the earlier stages of their relationship, where you begin to realize they were a hopelessly doomed couple, artistic and witty, both writers in New York, both young and beautiful, idealistic, she wealthy from the trust her parents established publishing Amazing Amy children's books based on her when she was a child. What you will notice in the film is how the family dynamic is prominent throughout. The focus on Amy's resentment of her parents, creating an alter-ego of their daughter that excelled where she failed, despite the privilege and status it provided her as an adult, a privilege she recognizes and loathes at the same time. And Nick, whose twin sister Go lives in North Carthage, the suburban town they grew up in, where Nick thoughtlessly brings Amy to live when they both find themselves unemployed at the same time his now deceased mother is diagnosed with terminal cancer. That, and their father who they abjectly placed in a nursing home, visiting once a year, an apathy developed out of disgust for the way he raised them. Amy and Nick seem to have deep seated family issues at the core of their unhappy marriage, addressing the question of whether or not our inability to have rich and healthy relationships in America is not a product of having not many great examples of them. The point is that you could spend all day picking apart this movie, debating what it's about, analyzing its motifs and symbols, or simply admiring it. Because it is powerfully wrought, thoughtfully designed, and the translation from novel to film is one of the best in years.Gone Girl is a shocker, full of twists and turns that move at a gradual, yet surprising pace. The movie is about two and half hours long, but you won't find yourself drifting off, no, you'll find yourself entranced, unable to pull away from either Nick or Amy or Go or Tanner Bolt, Nick high profile lawyer, for that matter. All of the characters are played thoughtfully, with the exception of Desi Collins, play by Neil Patrick Harris, who seemed out of place amongst the seriousness of the film, or maybe it is just too harsh a contrast from seeing him as Barney in How I Met Your Mother. Still, this is easily one of the best films of the year, packed with surprises that shake off your expectations in the most exhilarating way. Well written, directed, filmed, and acted, an all-around pleaser that will leave you with an eerie stillness that follows you, like Nick standing at the curb of his suburban home, out to the car as you try to digest what exactly it is you have just witnessed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Another masterpiece from Fincher,"If you like previous Fincher works like The Game, then you will thoroughly enjoy this, as it is full of stylish twists and turns in the film making. As someone that's not a huge Affleck fan, I felt he really did a good job with this role but Rosamund Pike steals the show with her performance. The Soundtrack is really well done sounding like a mix between Vangelis and Nine Inch Nails at points. I believe films should be advertised purely by who directs it, as a David Fincher fan this film is truly damn near perfect from the subtle perversion within editing, the innovative soundtrack and especially great social commentary. I honestly feel this film will receive negative reviews purely for the issues it looks, essentially the opposite effect of a movie like ""The Butler.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Gone Girl - One of the best of 2014,"How can you tell when a movie is great? It makes you feel good? It makes you feel gut- wretched? It makes you want to watch it again? It makes you want to talk and write about it? For me Gone Girl is all these things except the first one. This is not a feel good movie. But it is one hell of a movie. It picks you up, swirls you around and just when you think you know what's going on in pulls the rug from under you like a slap to the face. No wait, like a f***ing punch to the face.Ben Affleck is one of the most hated Hollywood actors, but there's really no reason for that. Not anymore. Those infamous Daredevil, Paycheck and Gigi years are long gone. It's been 10 years. And for the past 4 years Ben Affleck has produced (with the exception of Runner Runner, let's ignore that one) really great work. As an actor AND as a director. In Gone Girl he was superb. Flawless as an actor who plays a flawed character.The supporting cast is great (and I mean including Tyler Perry). But the one who steals the show is, without a doubt, Rosamund Pike. Her portrayal of the missing wife is beautifully constructed and layered. It's a very complex character, certainly not an easy one to play, but Rosamund Pike succeeds in turning it into a whimsical character. Oscar nomination? Certainly. Oscar grab? Too soon to tell.David Fincher. You twisted man. And I mean that in a good way. You took a very demanding book adaptation and it's all just so exquisite. Every shot, every character development, every dialogue, every twist... Fincher had the right ingredients and he cooked them perfectly for you to savor every single moment.Gone Girl starts as a simple but intense thriller. Yes the first half of the film starts a little bit slow. But it's all part of the act. After that it grows to be much more. The film tackles subjects like the complexity of marriage and the compromises it demands, the manipulative power of the media, the gullibility of the audience and the curse it is to be the subject to scrutiny of public opinion (The Hunt. Another very good film that approaches this same topic).(T)he Good: The brilliantly played characters, Fincher's directing, Trent Reznor's soundtrack, and the motherf***ing twists and turns.(T)he Bad: Neil Patrick Harris.

Gone Girl: Men Are So Dumb,"""Gone Girl"" centers around a woman (Rosamund Pike) who goes missing (presumably murdered) and the media coverage which ensues and rapidly turns the husband (Ben Affleck) into the prime suspect. As this film moves forward, there are other characters which help accentuate the mystery aspect of this ""murder mystery""; e.g. Desi (Neil Patrick Harris) a past lover, Margo (Carrie Coon) the husband's sister and only confidant, and Tanner Bolt (confidently played by Tyler Perry) a charismatic Johnnie Cochran-type who loves to win as much as he loves the pageantry of defending high profile clients.Though the storytelling is continuously strong, the first half of this film is constructed in a way that due to the actual source material (which was adapted for the big screen by Gillian Flynn, from her own novel) and a heavy slathering of director David Fincher's powerfully distinctive visual sensibility, this is a film that will intentionally fool people into thinking it to be a stylized but somewhat routine murder mystery, when in actuality, what ""Gone Girl"" turns into is more so a uniquely inventive, satirical, tale of fatal attraction.This ""turn"" takes place about half way through, when a major plot twist occurs. A twist which separates this film from the routine and (aside from the morbid slather of dark comedy perfectly incorporated into a film about murder) puts ""Gone Girl"" into a genre all its own. Not to say that other aspects of ""Gone Girl"" aren't up to par. The fact is, most of the performances are engaging (if you know me, then you know I hate to admit that Tyler Perry was a part of anything worth watching) especially the work of one Rosamund Pike, who delivers a performance so visceral that it should elicit a vocal response from audiences. But all of that is overshadowed by the fascinating marital motivation concepts thrown at the audience (especially in the final scene) Fincher's direction, some excellent editing and another haunting score from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross.Final Thought: Though ""Gone Girl"" is still receiving mostly positive critical reviews, I believe this to be a film that due to its unconventional comedic tone and twist, Fincher's adaptation of this odd little novel may not be truly appreciated as a masterwork until years down the line. Hell, with a 4 out of 5 Star review, I know that I don't truly appreciate the structural and satirical brilliance of a movie like ""Gone Girl"" as much as I should or eventually will.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Slow But Engaging Thriller,"David Fincher's Gone Girl is a slow paced thriller and engages you for the full two and a half hours with a different way of story telling which is not something that we see quite often. The film stands out with solid performances to complement and back the narrative to make it a must watch thriller that is mixed with the right doses of emotion and drama. The variety in how the story has been treated is too refreshing and puts Gone Girl in the league of some of the best films from Hollywood.The story has two central protagonists Amy (Rosamund Pike) and Nick Dunne (Benn Affleck). They fall in love and gets married but gradually difference of opinion puts gap in their marital life. On their fifth wedding anniversary day Nick returns home only to find that Amy is missing leaving some hidden clues but not conclusive enough for a breakthrough. The investigation that follow for the search and cause of Amy's missing is presented too well in this film from Fincher.The film has a slow pace initially but gradually picks up momentum and the treatment of the drama is such that never the movie goes dull or unexciting. As said earlier, direction and screenplay is backed by solid performances from all the actors to make Gone Girl a well crafted film in every department.Ben Affleck was in fine form as Nick Dunne portraying the character entrusted to him with such perfection and finesse. Matching equally was Rosamund Pike as Amy. Kim Dickens (as Detective Rhonda) was another actor who stood out with a terrific performance to match the lead pair. Also impressive was Carry Coon as Nick's sister and Tyler Perry who is the advocate helping Nick in his legal battle.So in every aspect, this movie stands apart and here is one cinema you cannot miss at any cost. Since i haven't read Gillian Flynn's novel, i am not in a position to say how far the adaptation from book has been but that does not stop me from giving four out of five for David Fincher's Gone Girl, a slow and an engaging thriller with a presentation that deserves a big thumbs up.

I was thinking I had it sussed at first. Knowing that there were a couple of twists on the horizon. But the fact that it can mislead you so easily is probably the reason why the film has become as popular as it has become. There is virtually no way you will predict where this movie is going, and when you think you have. Your wrong.""Gone girl"" is a brilliantly twisted thriller that has a dark and complicated plot that will have you hooked on a film that manages to breath new life into the careers of many of its stars too.

Best Movie of The Year!,"Every so often, there is a movie with full originality, great acting, great filming, and wide twists in the plot. Actually, this isn't ""fully"" original since it is about a disappearance, but the subplots and curveballs thrown are good enough! It follows a seemingly happy couple's (Affleck& Pike) journey after the wife goes missing. Throughout the movie, secrets will be revealed and the unexpected will ensue as we find out what really happened to the wife and how the marriage already was. The themes of dishonestly, media and perceiving are what make this movie important to see. If there wasn't important themes, there would not be importance and the movie itself would not have been as good. This movie is a first-rate thrill ride that has not been done amazingly since Inception back in 2010.

Like the book, it has elements showing the arc of bad marital relationships and cutting observations about men (e.g. The view of the ""cool girl"") as well as the media, but mostly this is just trashy fun. Unfortunately it's also a story with twists that are predictable, plot bits which are implausible, characters who are cliché, and an ending which is ridiculous. Worse yet, the central idea, a woman serially lying about rape and abuse, has a problematic air about it. Lots of great performances here, slick storytelling, and a very watchable popcorn film - just don't think about it too much.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Girl Out to Lunch,"'Gone Girl' begins with a married man, Nick, returning to his suburban home to find an open door, broken furniture, blood spatters and his wife Amy missing. Within a couple of days, Nick's account of an idyllic marriage starts falling apart, and the local police begin to suspect he's a wife-killer. Ominous clues are discovered, while a tabloid talk-show host ramps up public hysteria with gossipy revelations supplied by one of Amy's neighborhood pals. Director Fincher encourages his audience to join this vilification of Nick as flashbacks portray the couple's troubled relationship from entries in Amy's diary.Although the film possesses a few innovative ideas, it ends up a trashy melodrama. The big revelation arrives far too early, and the last third of 'Gone Girl' becomes increasingly far-fetched as any residual tension evaporates. The characters remain resolutely shallow, so there's little reason to care what happens to them as the tale starts drowning in a morass of plot-holes - and by the time it reaches its conclusion, an intriguing mystery has been transformed into a farce.",4.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Fincher delivers yet again,"Gone Girl was a highly anticipated movie for me, solely because I am die-hard Fincher fan. I think that he has created some of the best crime movies of all time; namely Zodiac and Seven. So I went into Gone Girl pretty excited. I am happy to say that the movie did not disappoint.The trailers led me to believe that this film would be more in the vein of Fincher's pulpier work, such as Panic Room, and I was expecting a well-made murder mystery/ thriller. Really, I got much more than I bargained for.Gone Girl is a movie that is so dark on the surface, yet strangely hilarious and enjoyable, perhaps only for people with somewhat sick senses of humor. Fincher knows that this story is satirical, and he works wonders by contrasting the ridiculousness of the story with a very mute aesthetic. The aesthetic choices in this movie are not so different from later Fincher movies, with DP Jeff Cronenworth doing wonderful work as usual, and Trent Reznor/Atticus Ross delivering their most detailed score yet. The score compliments the themes of the movie very well, as there are many sweet melodies that are gradually overtaken by dark tones and grinding sounds, and there are some extraordinarily creepy tracks.Performance wise, the cast is stellar. Affleck, who I have previously been fond of directing-wise but never completely based on acting, hits all the right notes, in a very challenging role. Nick Dunne must be a prick and frankly an idiot as well, and Affleck shows this without losing the support of the audience, a very tricky feat. Likewise, Rosamund Pike is good. I'll leave it at that, because saying any more would give away her wonderful character.The supporting cast is great, although Neil Patrick Harris was not given a lot to work with, and I feel like the storyline regarding his character, Desi Collins, was not given proper attention, and thus was the low point of the movie.Many have complained about the plot holes in this movie, but they are really missing the point. Sure, Gone Girl is really plot driven, but it is essentially a satire, and by the end of the film, the plot is secondary to explorations of marriage, relationships, American media, and public representation. Also, Gone Girl is not a sexist film, despite some complaints that it paints women in a bad light. David Fincher is not a misogynist, he is misanthropic, and he paints everyone, male and female, in equally awful lighting.FIncher's general distaste for people and their behavior is so evident in this movie, and in someone else's hands, this movie would be unlikable and hard to sit through. Luckily, Fincher knows exactly how to balance suspense, humor, pathos, and absurdity. Gone Girl is one of the year's best movies, but because of some uneven subplots, is not perfect, and is also not Fincher's best. However, it is equally entertaining and thought-provoking; a perfect marriage of pulp and art, about a very imperfect marriage of man and woman. Do not bring a date. You have been warned.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Twisty, Turny and Temperamental, Gone Girl Will Hook You to the Very End","David Fincher works wonders with a seemingly-difficult literary adaptation once again. Here he keeps us impaled on the hook through a twisting, thrashing, contorting murder mystery where nothing, not even the victim, is remotely as it seems. It's a great ride, one which delights in misleading the viewer into endless amounts of incorrect assumptions, while also managing to spotlight several timely, pertinent thoughts about the excesses of a 24-hour news cycle and the public's gullible yearning for their next big chance to cast shame upon a pariah. Gone Girl is effective, dramatic, gripping and entrancing for most of its duration, but does overstay its welcome and begin to unravel in the last twenty minutes. With most of the answers already on the table, it's strange that the film lingers for so long after the fact, neurotically toying with its own plot holes and giving its audience time to do the same. That's not enough to completely undo all of the good that had come before, of course, but it's plenty to cast a little doubt.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"""Deep into that darkness peering...""","David Fincher's latest sleight of hand leaves the viewer spellbound for hours after witnessing this nerve-hitting, raw depiction of a marriage fraught with secrecy. Similarly to Se7en, Fight Club, and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Gone Girl leaves a lasting impression, which is the hallmark of all truly great cinematic performances. The cinematography is captivating, the storytelling is masterful, acting is flawless, and the score sometimes turns into the sort of gut-wrenching throbbing and pounding that not only underscore the scene, but rivet your eyes to the screen and set your heart racing. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike are both at their best in this picture. They deliver exactly what the audience should expect of a Fincher movie's cast. Rosamund Pike pulls a relentless performance, bringing a cool, otherworldly wife into life on the screen.Perhaps the only foible of the movie is Neil Patrick Harris. Although his acting is good, he is not on par with the rest of the cast, all of whom perform exceptionally well.Gone Girl is very nearly a perfect experience that tackles the questions of media abuse, the gullibility of the masses who take everything at face value that comes at them from the TV, and the twisted ups and downs of an intricately irregular, yet hauntingly familiar marriage.If you fancy an intellectual shudder at something beautifully complex and entertaining, you shouldn't miss Gone Girl.I give the movie 9 stars out of 10.

"Dark, stylish and oh so suspenseful","David Fincher is actually one of my favorite directors particularly for his Neo-Noir thrillers like Se7en and Zodiac, though he's probably better known for things like The Social Network and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. Fincher, in a word, is an artist. He creates incredibly intricate and memorable settings for his films through his unique and highly stylistic visuals. Every scene in every film is crucial to the exposition of the story and has been painstakingly defined to be as impressionistic as possible. Fincher is known for being a relatively challenging director that often requires countless takes for a single shot as to get it perfectly aligned with the his vision for the film. But what's the result? His films are precise, beautiful, and often lend themselves to creating unmatched feelings of suspense and realistic psychological horror, and Gone Girl is no exception.Ben Affleck (Argo, Good Will Hunting) and the lovely Rosamund Pike (The World's End) star in this unforgiving commentary on modern marriage and on the detriments of sensationalism. Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry also provide strong supporting roles alongside the other more minor characters of the film. The story is that Nick Dunne (Affleck) arrives home one day to find that his wife Amy (Pike) is missing under suspicious circumstances. The Dunnes are both talented writers that live in the small town of New Carthage, Missouri along with Nick's twin sister (Carrie Coon) and father. As the story of Amy's disappearance begins sweeping the town and state, Nick's character comes under increasing scrutiny after some of Amy's blood is found in the kitchen of their home and he naturally is suspected of having committed foul play. Certain things are revealed that seemingly vilify Nick although his guilt is still in question since people like NPH - a revealed stalker of Amy - are introduced that cast a shadow of a doubt in the audience's mind. That's basically all I can say without giving the twists and turns of the story, but they should be fairly easy to guess with enough Law and Order under your belt.The entire cast has a certain authenticity to them ranging from the overzealous neighbor that's out to crucify Affleck's character to the tenacious detective played by Kim Dickens. I was even surprised by Affleck in this movie as he doesn't seem like a caricature but rather a genuine every-man who has his situation go from bad to worse. It was actually Rosamund Pike that really blew me away in this film, not simply because she's absolutely gorgeous, but because her role as Amy illustrates the actress's diverse abilities on screen. Much like the movie Laura (1944) and how it propelled the strikingly beautiful Gene Tierney to stardom, I see Gone Girl having a similar effect on Pike's fairly relatively infant career. Until now she's played a few minor supporting roles in less than noteworthy films like Miranda Frost in Die another Day or Andromeda in Wrath of the Titans, but I have really started to take notice since her appearance in Edgar Wright's The World's End as Sam Chamberlain. My guess is you'll be seeing a lot more of the charming British actress in years to come.If you want a good head-start on your Oscar watch-list, this would probably be a wise place to start. Affleck and Pike will no doubt be nominated in the best actor/actress categories respectively, and I see Gone Girl taking home a few other various awards like Best Original Score for Trent Reznor and Atticus Rose's accompanying soundtrack.It might even sneak into the Best Picture category, though I don't see it as a clear front-runner. Fincher once again delivers a beautifully crafted suspense thriller that will leave you guessing until the very end and forever questioning your spouse's inner thoughts and intentions.Read this and other reviews on the DriveInZeppelin website.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Stunning Peace of Work,"Indeed David Fincher did it again. At the surface the movie script resembles a totally over the top fictitious story which could never happen for real, with the Find Amy Trust Fund and the nightly press coverage. Only occasionally once in a decade such a thing could happen in America but in the rare event it does the missing girl is either never found back or found dead. Press coverage of such events is these days mostly brought as aftermath after finding a dead body. Inside Gone Girl the audience is presented with a 'live' kidnapping where the wealthy parents within 24 hours setup a website with a trust-fund to find their Amy back, including day to day press coverage, like we have seen from the Madeleine McCann case. Gone Girl kept me watching for two hours and thirty minutes without even feeling the need for a break for a smoke or drink, which likewise only happens to me once in a decade. People who followed the McCann disappearance will no doubt do the same. A warning is at place though as the ending is quite unusual and will put-off a lot of McCannies including Amy's husband Ben Affleck who plays his amicable role as the Missouri husband very nicely. After watching the viewer will finally understand why it is that real rapers and sexual abusers never burn their hands on women like amazing Amy Elliot, and aim for the homeless and orphans instead. Is Gone Girl a movie which is only produced occasionally once in a decade ? It depends whether or not Hollywood is interested in doing a blockbuster about the disappearance of Madeleine McCann featuring its real details, which is no fairy tale as the Portugese Police department has made the entire dossier material available to the public, which has never happened before during the entire documented history of Interpol, Europol or the Metropolitan Police combined.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

I give it 7 stars for a decent effort in production, ambience, and acting, especially from supporting cast Carrie Coon, Missi Pyle, and NPH. However, if you peel through the plot, there are so many unbelievable holes and questions - unbelievable because how can a movie of this high production value gloss over these loose ends and expect the viewer not to notice?

"You Won't Soon Forget ""Gone Girl""","At first glance this might look like just another who-dun-it mystery thriller with a star-studded cast, but this film stands out proudly from the rest in that typically clichéd genre. The mystery unravels slowly and meticulously, forcing the audience to spend time with characters that they can rarely be sure of. Sympathies shift uneasily from one character to another and from time to time, everyone on-screen seems repulsive, but it's impossible to look away.It plays out like Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" or Clouzot's ""Diabolique."" Like these two films, it starts with a catchy little plot that lets you ease into the world of the film as you prepare to watch a fun little mystery, but then it plunges into depths that you never could have expected. The first hour could have been pulled out into a full-length movie, but it's not content to stop there--it drags its audience into some dark, twisted places, but it never stops being completely immersive and exciting. It pulls all of that off through some subtly beautiful cinematography (as can be expected from Fincher and Jeff Cronenweth, the cinematographer), and very quiet, but intense performances. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike both do an incredible job at giving the audience brief glimpses at powerful, but buried emotions.Maybe not the best date movie ever made, but most certainly one of the most effective mysteries of the last few years--""Gone Girl"" delivers like you can't believe. My advice is to stop reading reviews and just go experience it for yourself.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
The best thriller I've seen in a long time.,"It's finally time for another David Fincher movie. I've always loved that director due to many reasons. He makes fantastic thrillers in a way that only he can do. Last time, he did a remake of the Swedish movie The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, which I personally thought was really good. Even better than the Swedish version. So now it's time to see if Fincher can turn another best selling book into an amazing thriller, and yes he can.To keep it short and not spoil anything, Gone Girl is a movie about Nick Dunne (played superbly by Ben Affleck) who's wife disappears one day. After a short time, many suspects that Nick might not be innocent. Throughout the movie the story gets more and more exciting, and I was at the edge of my seat the whole time. The movie had a lot of twists and was never predictable. What's even better is that the movie barely included violence. But Fincher does something to make this two and a half our long film very exciting.To begin with, all the actors did a very good job. I'm not a fan of Ben Affleck, but he was really good in Gone Girl. Just like Neil Patrick Harris and Rosamund Pike. They did a lot to this film. Secondly, the story is very good. The plot might be something you've heard before, but it develops really well throughout the movie. The soundtrack also helped the film a lot, it was a great. And of course I can't forget to mention the superb directing by David FincherOverall, Gone Girl is one of the best thrillers I've seen in a while. It might not win an Oscar for best picture, but it sure has enough potential to get nominated. I had high expectations for the film, and the didn't disappoint me. Gone Girl is a strong 9/10.PS: It was nice to see Patrick Fugit back on the big screen, I haven't seen him since Almost Famous. Although he didn't have a lot of lines, he still did a pretty good job.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Domestic Horror at it's Finest!,"The first real horror release in the United States this October, doesn't come in the form of a cash grab movie about a possessed doll. No, rather it comes to us in the form of a nightmare of the American dream. Gillian Flynn and David Fincher have done for marriage, what Darren Aronofsky did for drug use in 'Requiem for a Dream'. 'Gone Girl' is a deliciously dark, furiously acted, and surprisingly funny representation of the dark side of married life. At times it's absurd as all Hell. But nevertheless, entertaining throughout.Nick Dunne (Affleck) returns home from the beach one morning where he wandered off to collect his thoughts, to find that his wife Amy (Pike) is missing, and there seems to have been a struggle upon her disappearance. As Nick calls the authorities to report it, what is instantly off putting is how relaxed he is towards the situation at hand. In flashbacks, we see the structuring of Nick and Amy's relationship. Everything being bubbly and perfect at first of course; And as it would be, financial troubles, infidelity, and just the wear and tear of married life takes its toll.It so happens that Amy disappears on the morning of the 5th anniversary of her marriage with Nick. She had left behind ""clues"" for Nick to discover that seemed to be leading him to a romantic conclusion, and the detectives investigating her disappearance think that perhaps these clues can be used to locate Amy. As the movie pushes it's plot going forward in the first half, Nick begins to be shredded by the media and local community. Everyone believing that he is involved in Amy's disappearance somehow, perhaps murdering her. This notion becomes even more potent when it's revealed he's been having an affair with a much younger woman.The plot thickens further when Nick notices an ex boyfriend at a rally fundraiser for Amy. He becomes worried of his appearance, convinced of his involvement. However, Nick becomes manipulated by the media even further, and as more evidence surfaces to which it looks like it's a no-brainer he's guilty of murder. However, the mother of all twists takes place, and Gone Girl takes a deep, dark plunge into madness very quickly. Without revealing too much, I'll say as someone who avoided the novel I had grand ideas for how I thought this film would play out. And god damn was I mistaken. The one thing that prevents me from giving the film a perfect score is the fact that it's story has such a distasteful view towards married life. As if nobody is ever to be trusted with your love, and that we're all inherently pieces of grool. Once the film kicks into absurdity, it becomes the blackest of black comedies maybe ever; but that's what's so damn fun about it. Do I sympathize with anyone in the movie? Not really. It's a well thought out examination of how media works into tricking people into jumping to conclusions, and there's some interesting things to gather from it's stance on how ugly things can become behind closed doors. That doesn't mean it's not shlock. However, it's shlock of the highest order.David Fincher is a master of perfection, and nothing's changed with this entry into his filmography. Every shot, every movement, every damn breath of a character is pre-planned, and executed to perfection. And as much of an advocate I am for 35mm, David Fincher is making the best case for digital filmmaking. He and returning favorite cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth captured this darkly lit story impeccably. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross return as well to provide a pulse like soundtrack, that never goes too far, but always creates the necessary atmosphere. Of course credit has to be given to Gillian Flynn on producing such a twisted story, and filling in scenes with such tasty dialogue in her debut as a screenwriter.What would this movie be however without great performances? And man they are a plenty. Affleck once again turns in a great role, this time very subtle and subdued. He's not asking you to feel sorry for him, and I like that a lot. The standout far and away is Rosamund Pike however, and unfortunately I can't go into details why. Man oh man though, she is absolutely at the peak of her game here. To my biggest surprise is how good Tyler Perry is playing Nick's snaky lawyer. Neil Patrick Harris as the creepy ex-boyfriend is fine, somewhat miscast I feel. Another small weakness in the film.Comparisons are being made to Hitchcock, De Palma, Verhoeven, etc. Fine I guess. To me, it was all Fincher, all the way. He earned his right to claim a style, 3 films ago. This is Zodiac, Panic Room, Se7en, The Social Network all rolled into one. It's not as good as 3 out 4 of those films, but it's yet another reminder that Fincher has meticulous detail in every frame. And a lingering sense of attitude and dread waiting behind every corner. Cheers to another great film, from a modern maverick of cinema.614moviebuff.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Heart-Stopping, Spine-Tingling, Edge-Of-Your-Seat, Movie Madness","David Fincher's resume shows that he is one of the finest directors in the business today. From Fight Club to The Social Network, you can't possibly go wrong. Well, believe me when I tell you that Gone Girl stands in the ranks of his best work. This is a hell of a movie. Or, if you will, a hell of a book, turned into a hell of a movie. But the ""what came first?"" argument is invalid here, when Fincher successfully replicates Gillian Flynn's brilliant thriller novel on screen, as he does here. The words fly off the page so seamlessly. It's almost seductive. The performances are grade A, coming from Ben Affleck but ESPECIALLY coming from Rosamund Pike. Pike steals the show as Amy Dunne, making her the most sinister on-screen anti-hero since Keyser Soze. Even performances from the likes of Neil Patrick Harris and .. I can't believe I'm saying this. Tyler Perry are at the top of their game. It's the most jaw dropping film of the year, and as a film-goer, you will be left satisfied.

Twisted Mind Game,"With his wife (Rosamund Pike)'s disappearance having become the focus of an intense media circus, a man (Ben Affleck) sees the spotlight turned on him when it is suspected that he may not be innocent.Not being familiar with the source material, most of the twists and turns came completely unexpected. And it was just such a wild trip, one that could be experienced again and again (probably making more sense with each viewing). Affleck is strong here, and Pike absolutely steals the show. Whether this is a contender for Best Picture or Best Director is doubtful, but Pike has a strong shot at Best Actress.Shockingly, Neil Patrick Harris is not as strong of an actor as one might think, though his role is relatively small. Tyler Perry, on the other hand, is amazing and will blow anyone away who thinks of him simply as the ""Madea"" guy. The plot slows down a bit in the third act, but overall is a tense thriller that is sure to please any movie fan. David Fincher has not made a bad movie yet.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Over-rated,"14 November 2014. I suspect why this movie is getting rave reviews and good box office turnout is due to its sustained measured suspense as a dramatic thriller where the who done it element becomes convoluted and layered with great emotional intensity as the audience is seemingly and subtly manipulated throughout the movie as to Ben Affleck's character and the apparent absence and presumed demise of his wife. Things become extraordinarily complicated that gives the audience a continuous shot of neurological brain transmitters of titillating endorphins.
One other pertinent fact that impacts my own personal experience watching this movie is that living in Utah where Susan Powell disappeared who lived in West Valley City, Utah and whose body was never been found and Josh Powell, her husband, was suspected in her disappearance and who later killed himself along with their two children. There were many parallels between this real event and Gone Girl.
But perhaps I am getting old; and watching this movie I'm reminded of Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner in The War of the Roses (1989). If the movie had stopped two-thirds of the way through the movie with the first major twist, I might have really enjoyed this movie in its totality, but it continued with this odd twist that seemed like a guise for greatest as a film. Needlessly the audience is forced to watch a rather predictable sequence of events that seem creatively amazing but somehow it just seems tacked on with the appearance of genius. I can understand why this movie would seem innovative and offer up some new revelation of the human psyche not see before on the big screen.
Perhaps its just I was unfortunately lucky to begin to put the pieces of this mystery thriller together too soon, but this overly long, in places overly slow paced movie became too predictable, foreshadowing its scenes and the ending. For awhile the plot and characters were fascinating, the plot intriguing but eventually, the movie just seemed very good. Others might conclude this movie portrays a rather unique, albeit rarely seen complex characters who diverge from the ordinary two dimensional personas. While this might be true, there is something off-balance but not in aesthetic way, but detracting way. What David Fincher is striving for is one of the most difficult achievements in film directing. His effort is commendable, if somewhat unsatisfying for me. If the movie had been shot in the style and tone of say cerebral spy thriller The Russia House (1990) or Ben Affleck's The Sum of All Fears (2002), Gone Girl would have come across more in keeping with the icy, frigid psychologically tension and dramatic tone of the theme of the movie. One of the best examples of this conflicted tone might be Brad Pitt's character and performance as scripted in Interview with A Vampire (1995) or his scripted performance in the dramatic crime thriller Killing Them Softly (2012) or even Nicholas Cages scripted portrayal in The Weatherman (2005) or Daniel Day-Lewis in the drama filled There Will Be Blood (2007). Even the classic bitter sweet relational drama and alcohol-riddled theme of The Days of Wine and Roses (1962) has the oil and water imbalance that however is deliciously sweet and sour tone that this movie might have been well to have captured. Or take Nicole Kidman's harsh but memorable role in Margot at the Wedding (2007) or her role in Dogville (2004) or what happened to Brad Pitt in the superb mystery crime thriller Se7en (1995). Other edgy movie themed and uneasy but dramatic riveting movies that capture the paradoxical tone of beautiful ugliness include William H. Macy in Edmond (2006), Sam Rockwell's fascinating character in Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002), the dysfunctional family of American Beauty (2000), or Tom Cruise in Collateral (2004) even whose title is reflective of the dissonance of a battle where innocence is destroyed. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman in director Stanley Kubrick seemed to capture both the cinematic beauty and the uneasy alliance between the unusual, fantastic in an artful and sinfully beautiful way with characters that sometimes lack in moral turpitude in his Eyes Wide Shut (1999) or take the sociological business war with its incumbent cold calculating businessmen of The Social Network (2010). Even Leo DeCaprio seemed to capture the decadent attractive sleaze character in The Great Gatsby (2013) or his performance as Howard Hughes in The Aviator (2004). What seems to be missing is the more balanced background of the development of the relationship, a better visceral sense of the characters as they evolve which is conveniently missing during the movie, except with deliberate shocking sometimes unflattering flashbacks which was seemingly achieved with one character played by Christian Slater in He Was A Quiet Man (2007). The real fault in this very difficult film is that absence of the depiction of the behind the scenes of the false facades and the real persona essences of which even the characters themselves are unaware so as to reveal the hidden pane in Johari Window.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Great Movie,"Gone Girl is the latest movie directed by David Fincher. Fincher is one of the few directors who can sell a film in his own right after movies such as Fight Club and Seven. It's great to report that Gone Girl can be added to the list of impressive movies he's directed.The film centres around the disappearance of Amy Dunne(Rosamund Pike) who is married to Nick (Ben Afflick). The story is told in a series of flash backs and flash forwards as we gradually get to know all the characters and the circumstances surrounding the disappearance. The first 30 minutes or so is slightly slow, but is important as it gives an insight into all the main characters. The rest of the movie is spellbinding and has numerous twists and turns. I suspect if you stopped and thought about it for a bit some parts probably don't really hang together, but it's so well done nobody (well I guess some people will!) is going to complain about that.Pike is absolutely brilliant in the lead role and manages to outshine Afflick which is quite a compliment!",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

I had unfortunately previously had many of the plot points already spoiled for me so nothing came as a shock, maybe it is because i knew what to expect that i could just enjoy the film for the entertaining ride that it is and maybe that's why i managed to not get mad at the possible plot holes? Don't get me wrong there are certain moments that annoyed me because i found them unbelievable but it didn't spoil my enjoyment of the film as a whole. I also wish that the film had ended better but maybe it ended the same way as the book ended? I have still to read it. I thought that all of the acting in this film was superb and i thought David Fincher did a great job of bringing the film together, i am a big fan of Fincher's style and once again for me he didn't disappoint. I'm now looking forward to reading Gillian Flynn's book so that i can compare the two.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Exciting and surprising all the time, ""Gone Girl"" by David Fincher,is a wonderful experience that focuses on the hypocrisies of the media circus and the problems of a marriage","Written by Gillian Flynn from her own book, the script accompanies failed writer Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck), who, married to the beautiful and wealthy Amy (Rosamund Pike), discovers, on their five-year wedding anniversary, , that the wife disappeared. Activated, the local police gradually begin to suspect that the subject is responsible for Amy's disappearance - an idea that becomes stronger from Nick's casual behavior in the face of serious circumstances. Supported by his sister Margo (Carrie Coon), he slowly realizes the seriousness of the situation as Detective Rhonda (Kim Dickens) unearths secrets of the Dunne marriage.Fincher, even acting several times in the same genre, is able to address different themes - and in different ways - in his incursions. ""Se7en"" was purely about the abomination on Earth, ""Zodiac"" was devoted to analyzing a man's obsession with answers, and his ""Millennium"" was a hodgepodge of topics like journalistic credibility and the abuse of women in Sweden. ""Gone Girl"" is a wonderful experience that focuses on the hypocrisies of the media circus and the problems of a marriage, and what is surprising is how Fincher and Flynn permeate the story with an unexpected sense of black and cynical humor: conventions as the story formula. Of ""Boy Meets Girl, Boy Loses Girl"" are broken up in an amazing way, leading to a bitter conclusion and from which it is impossible not to let out a malicious giggle. Even a visual and metalinguistic gag in particular is amusing, when the police find the ""first clue"".But there is much more under the surface. One of the greatest pleasures of David Fincher's work lies in following its revelations and twists. Even so, it is safe to say that the structure designed by Flynn is intriguing as it offers two points of view for the main events of the narrative: Nick's, which we follow objectively, and Amy's, to which we are introduced through the narration of passages from his personal diary and which appear in the femme fatale voice, whispered and assured, by Rosamund Pike - and which contrasts with the performance of Ben Affleck, who constructs Nick as a man who, under his arrogant posture, hides an insecure personality that it does not always manifest itself in the best way in order to disguise its discomfort. However, even if the protagonist is obviously a flawed individual, the fact is that Affleck makes us like him, which is fundamental for the film to work, since we are constantly rooting for Nick to prove himself innocent despite the circumstances of Amy's disappearance. Become increasingly incriminating. In addition, as the feature introduces us to his wife's version, we are confronted by a less than adorable Nick, which leads us to question his posture as a fun and good-natured boy and to understand his companion's growing sadness.Strengthened by the contrasts between these two versions, ""Gone Girl"" ends up becoming an exercise that, at times, is reminiscent of works such as Rashomon - something underscored by Kirk Baxter's brilliant montage, which not only jumps fluidly between these individual narratives but also finds the ideal balance between the tense pace of a thriller and the need to carefully develop the story. (Managing, in the process, to include fabulous cuts like the one from Nick and Amy kissing to the moment when the subject has his mouth wiped for DNA collection.) Donald Graham Burt's production design makes an excellent counterpoint between the vast spaces, but with little human warmth, of the Dunne house and the small but welcoming home of his sister, also getting it right by creating Amy's diary with an excessively methodical handwriting that reveals much of its owner. Finally, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' score is evocative without relying on obvious themes, complementing the atmosphere of tension without trying to create it alone.Intelligently taking advantage of the plot to make a current and relevant comment on the way journalism has been confused with entertainment, abandoning any trace of responsibility as long as the ""information"" published earns an audience or serves some other particular purpose, the film illustrates how the media is able to capture an incident that lasts half a second (like an automatic smile, for example) and transform it into something infinitely greater, creating a dark narrative where there was only a distracted reflection. Fincher never tires of going after these meanders to propose a new discussion about limits and individualities. This is one of the most interesting points of view of ""Gone Girl"", although this discourse may sound repetitive to some. But he is not talking here about the overwhelming power of the press, but how to use it against or to its value. And that mere detail makes all the difference. Assuming the roles of accuser, jury, judge and executioner, this ""journalism"" is not afraid of murdering reputations or destroying lives as long as it converts into page views and money - and it is revealing how, instead of trying to prepare Nick's case from the point of view from a legal point of view, the good lawyer Tanner Bolt (Perry, surprising for the first time in his career) realizes that it is much more important to build a media strategy.""Gone Girl"", although it is a good distance from Fincher's bigger films, is perhaps the most evident proof of his meticulous work with the image, while reaffirming his ability to make use of what is most common in genre films, while at the same time that it subverts these constants. Here he plays with the thriller, and even includes an unexpected touch of black humor in the fear when discussing the wear and tear of a relationship between two. At this point, he rescues his old discussions about the cruel, violent and selfish nature of modern man, as well as the work of the media in mythologizing, deifying, blaspheming and manipulating. The essential difference from his other films lies in the way he creates a rupture between the image with the action described and the one to be staged as requested by the script. If before there was a wonderful fluency and synergy between the characters and the action, now the two seem not to be on the same wavelength. On purpose, Fincher creates in Exemplary Girl a profound image study masked by a supposed character study.Already Ben Affleck for being as loved and at the same time hated as Nick, and Pike for his icy beauty, as inviting as it is mysterious and intriguing. Both, regardless of anything, maintain this break between image and action in the film just for the simple fact of being who they are and how they are. Nick Dune is one of the most faithful and real character studies of masculinity that cinema has ever seen. He begins the plot as a seductive and ""different"" man from the others, in love and totally faithful to his wife. Until personal conflicts begin to invade the marriage and begin to expose the real identity of both characters. Soon he becomes the archetypal lazy, indifferent man who can't make decisions for himself (basically a portrait of what 90% of marriages become by the time the two reach their 30s).The metaphors placed at the literal level in ""Gone Girl"" interestingly address marital conflicts and the feelings that one spouse hides from the other. The way he does it is surrounded by clues and new details that are discovered over time. The most fantastic device in history is role reversal. Both in the book and in the adaptation - both written by Gillian Flynn (Sharp Objects) - the audience starts the plot assuming that Nick is the bad side and Amy the good side. In the main plot twist presented, this polarization is shown to be important for transmitting the main shock to those who are watching. The script throws the viewer to opposite sides to create the feeling of indignation, which dictates the film from the middle to the end.To truly unravel the film, one must ask the following question to which, sadistically, we never get a concrete answer. After all, what do the two see in each other? Fincher even tries to show us what made them get involved, but when we realize that it's all from the narrator's point of view, and she can never be trusted, and that Nick himself is far from perfect, it becomes obvious that the lack of chemistry and veracity in the opening scenes is more than deliberate - to fool the fool, I would say. My answer, at least, is in the moment where Amy decides to return, when she sees Nick on TV and notices things that only she could: the tie she bought, the gesture that only they knew, him saying exactly the things she wanted to hear. At that moment, one realizes that the film is also a delicate character study, as we discover more in that reaction, naturally surprised while biting an ice cream, than in any dialogue throughout the projection. Amy knew he was lying, but the fact that he knew what would mess with her was enough for him to realize something that I ended up realizing... Within their respective madness and the hatred that Nick feels for Amy (because she doesn't hate anyone, she just wants to be entertained), the truth is that both would never settle for someone different. Does she bring out the best in him? No. But only a being as...brute in the guise of a cult as Nick would be able to withstand the psychological terror his marriage puts him through, and when he rants and talks about how the two just want to destroy each other she responds (followed by her response genial to Nick's request for a paternity test): this is marriage.Ending with an iconic shot (deja vu) and that performs a small miracle by making us feel the same way at the beginning and end of the projection (curious, confused, alienated), This is another great work by David Fincher, the film still proves the old maxim of montage by demonstrating that, in carefully structured films, the viewer will only fully understand the meaning of the foreground of a feature when watching the last one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Depressing but beautiful and riveting at the same time,"This is great, great Fincher.

Utterly depressing and beautiful at the same time; I loved it!",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A Great Movie,"This movie is one of the best I've ever seen. The actings are superb, the plot and the intelligence behind it are just amazing. Although it's been 2 years since I watched it, sometimes I still think about some scenes in this movie. Actings, directing and story are just great.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Extremely unpredictable,"I have to start at the beginning with this one. Back when I saw Fincher directing this mystery, I totally assumed it'd be another Zodiac/The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo type of mystery- pretty straight-forward, very moody and dark, very beautifully shot. Heck, even two weeks ago I thought this. I thought it was just a simple woman-gone-missing case, and so the fact that Rosamund Pike was getting so much attention for it, for a possible Oscar nod, really blew my little mind. It wasn't until around a week ago or so that I accidentally got spoiled, and a pretty big one at that- that Pike played a villain, and that she was psychotic. Since it was unintentionally spoiled, I couldn't really get all upset but it did suck that now I knew a lot about it. Had I gone into the film completely blind, I would've been extremely shocked at every revelation.This is a really twisted film, in a way I don't think Fincher has made since Fight Club. Whereas I expected a very serious, very atmospheric mystery, I got a thriller that took quite a lot of turns, and was also very often pretty funny and quite often super silly and just so much fun. I don't mean that as a negative, since I think it really made for quite an experience. The audience I was watching it with really took to all of it, mostly in a way I'm sure most of them didn't expect. On the downside, I'm not sure how well this will fare with rewatches, since it's very heavily plot-driven. But going by how most of Fincher's films I loved even more with time, I'm not too worried about that.Technically, I don't think this is quite as showy as Fincher's recent outings. I was actually pretty surprised by how it wasn't driven by atmosphere and mood through cinematography in a way his last four films have. It's nicely shot, but this is the first time I wasn't marveling at just how beautiful a Fincher film looked. Maybe it was all of the plot turns that didn't have me focus so much on that? Regardless, surprising in that way, not that it matters so much. The score is wonderful, but definitely not as present as the scores for Social Network and Dragon Tattoo were. The editing is also strong, but not nearly as showy as his last two outings (if that's a good or bad thing, depends on you).I've never been a big Ben Affleck fan when it comes to his acting (like most people) but he's never been awful either. The only time he really impressed me was in The Town, but I think this is quite easily the best I've ever seen him do. He really strikes a perfect balance with the character and the tone the film is trying to achieve, so much so that I think he's in the same league as Rosamund Pike. It's true that Pike has a hell of character to work with, something I definitely didn't predict before getting spoiled. I thought she did great, but I didn't find her nearly as amazing as many seemed to Between this and The Leftovers, Carrie Coon is really having an amazing year. And like a few people here, I felt that she might actually be the film's MVP, being able to bring such an authenticity to a character that could've felt like such a caricature and bringing loads of emotional investment in her. Kim Dickens isn't that far behind, really delivering the most of her role in a way no other supporting player besides Coon did.I also want to highlight just how tonally weird the film is in the first half. I'm just super happy that this was not at all what I had expected weeks ago (not that that would've been a bad film). The fact that it came off as this weird, pretty funny, campy yet also serious satire and thriller is to be applauded, because I haven't seen many recent films like this.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Garbage. This film is Body Heat for idiots.,"This is one of the worst films in recent memory. Everything about it was terrible: the score, the acting, the characters, the dialogue, and the absolutely ridiculous and insulting hole-filled plot.Do not waste your money on this garbage. It will only make you angry.Not a single note of this film rings true. Nothing that happens seems even remotely plausible.SPOILERSThe Pike character frames the man she kills for her kidnapping and the police buy it. Not really sure why they don't check to see if he had an alibi for the day she disappeared. Not really sure why they believe that she murdered her kidnapper while being raped and then instead of calling 911, she got in a car, covered in blood, and drove to another state to be with her husband who -- according to her own diary -- she believed hated her and wanted to kill her.Writing this and having to remember this stupid film is making me angry again.

Not that bad,"I see sooo many negative reviews regarding this film and I get the point. How that there is so many parts which does not make sense. But i just wanna say that there is obviously flaws in most schemes you plot. Amy is portrayed smart and psychotic but it does not mean that she is soooo brilliant that she can come up with a plot which is flawless and make sense to all the audience. The film clearly shows how there is pressure from the society and how much people loves Amy. Police looks at evidence when they investigate a case. Furthermore, they are just town officers. You cant really expect them to deep dive into the case when all of the evidence present are pointing towards Nick. However I don't like any of the characters and they make me so annoyed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
A beautiful critique of post-modern life!,"Very well done movie, and totally on point with the whole ""psychopath"" thing! I really appreciate screen-writers that do their research and talk about sociopaths and psychopaths appropriately. When it's done correctly, it turns out really well! So many aspects of the movie reflect the post-modern condition and the manipulative/narcissistic aspects of the self. It also critiques the post-modern individual's obsession with the obscene in the way that the obscene is played out throughout the movie. Generally speaking, it is a critique of average life and that becomes VERY apparent at the end. It's a dark satire and I loved it for that! Not many movies are well-engineered for the sociological mind. Usually it's more obvious, but there was a lot of unpacking in this brilliant film!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

The Embodiment Of Psychological Thriller,"Psychological thrillers are made to mess with your mind, and in some case they succeed. But nothing ever messed with me more than Gone Girl. The movie starts in a very mild and secure way. It introduces the characters on their good side. But the more it moves on, the darker it gets, the more tensed it gets and the more it messes with you. I think its one of the best character developement in cinema's history. The camera shots are impressive, the actors facial expressions are intense and disturbing. One of the most powerful aspect of this movie is that its hard to imagine any of whats going on. Many movies have things in common, but this one doesnt have a lot in common with any other movies. The characters are impressively unique and the plot is almost unthinkable to my opinion. The twists are so frequent that you never have time to breath. Like a lot of other David Fincher movies, it introduces you to a fake safe environement and slowly drags you into a much more dark and tensed one. And all of this very subtly. An other quality that this movie and other Fincher movies have is that you can rarely tell what is going to happend, its one of the reasons why its so hard to look away while watching this movie. The structure of the film was really well made so that it didnt need a plot twist ending. It is one of the most unique movie ever made and I strongly recommend it to dark movies fan.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Far-fetched,"Gone Girl is the most far-fetched piece of crap I have ever seen. It is one of the biggest scam movies ever perpetrated on the public! That said, David Fincher is one of my favorite directors. I have seen all of his movies and watched them many times, always discovering something new to appreciate. I will never watch this one again. Fine acting, great background music by Trent Reznor, good photography, but a story that is so ridiculously exaggerated that I was waiting for the next twist so that I could witness how much more absurd the story could become, and there were several of them.

This movie...what a thriller!! I LOVED this film and felt quite a frustration at the ending: Fincher's goal with the ending, however, was to have the viewer feel the same frustration the main character felt, a sensation I have never experienced in a movie. Loved it.EXCELLENT cast. Fincher carefully picked Pike over Witherspoon and I am thankful he did. Pike played her role perfectly and provided her soothing voice and wonderful tone. Affleck was perfect for his role, as his demeanor and real-life Hollywood experiences helped propel his relation to his character. Tyler Perry was great, and Neil Patrick Harris was a joy to watch.So far, my biggest 10 out of 10 for a film. HIGHLY, highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Sofisticated evil,"I have been complaining about the Hollywood movies lately because their lack of excitement and intelligence, but once in awhile, movies like Gone Girl really makes me want to go to the theater again.Gone Girl is a chilling story of a marriage gone bad.

It raises a question for some of us. Can being married be that bad?Rosamund Pike isn't my favorite actor but I have to admit, she is always good with whatever role she plays.

Not worth your money if you've read the book.,"If you know how the book ends, I would not recommend that you spend money to watch this film. The book is much more complex and layered than the film, while the film has a relatively simple narrative which strongly simplifies, while nothing much is added to the original story except for a parade of explanations. I believe that the central plot twist, which is clear enough from the first shot, is explained a total of six times. Are there really people out there who need something explained to them six times in the space of half an hour? Also, the role of product placement in this film is a further indicator that the people who made this film believe that you are an idiot. One of the first lines of dialogue between Nick and Amy goes something like 'I see you're drinking some delicious Belgian wheat beer'. Then, a bottle of Hoegaarden takes up half the screen for some time. After this ridiculous display, it takes around half an hour to feel remotely sympathetic towards the leading characters. If I heard someone talking about Belgian wheat beer in such a manner, I would punch them in the head. Later, in someone else's fridge, there's your bottle of Hoegaarden again. Not to mention the first few minutes of the film, which are basically an advertisement for Volvo, and the brand name SONY that appears on screen every ten minutes. I imagine that this movie is quite good if you have not read the book which I strongly recommend, and if you can get past the fact that you are being force-fed advertisements throughout. I should also mention that Neil Patrick Harris is a bad actor.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Gone Girl - Movie Experience,"Marriage, in most sense, is a socially recognized union between two people that establishes rights and duties between them, including their children and their in-laws. And in most cases, that union doesn't last for a very long time. Questions arise between the spouses that lead to many challenges. What are you thinking? What are you feeling? What have done to each other? What will we do? My first praise goes to the story (or the screenplay) because the common subject of marriage problems after a recession has been beautifully twisted in the most conniving and manipulative manner. The novelist, Gillian Flynn, has penned the screenplay herself. I don't know whose decision was that, but it was a good decision in the end. The unfolding of each character, the non-linear narrative jumping between happy times and bad times of the couple, and the twist that leaves you mesmerized makes us completely attached to the characters. My unique experience from this movie is that my fellow peers had failed to notice many dark humorous dialogues, and most of the times I ended up laughing alone in the theater.David Fincher, the director, is known for his low lighting shots and again we see them beautifully executed in this movie. Equal praise goes to the cinematographer as well. What was missing in this movie, based on my experience, was his trademark style of wide angled shots. My only guess is that he avoided wide shots to bring the audience closer to the characters, especially the couple, involving them in the characters' own twisted world. The music, directed by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, brilliance at its core, escalated many scenes of the movie and heightened the mysteries surrounding the lead characters.When it comes to performances, Rosamund Pike (playing Amy Dunne, the wife) stands out more than Ben Affleck (playing Nick Dunne, the husband). Her choice of tone in background narration and on-screen dialogues was soothing and creepy at the same. Special praises go to Rosamund and Ben for meticulously researching about their characters. Special mention goes to Kim Dickens for her amazing supportive performance as Detective Rhonda Boney. On the downside of performances, I was wishing more serious and creepy stuff from Neil Patrick Harris considering that great comedians are known for their portrayal of more serious roles.The major and only frustration from my movie experience is that I have watched it in Indian cinemas. The nudity scenes were hidden by zooming in on a particular spot of the shot. And the violent and bloody scenes were edited horribly to reduce the gory nature of those scenes. I can empathize to a certain extent of hiding out the nude scenes, but I will never entertain in masking out the violent scenes. The reason I am mentioning this in my article is because it had disturbed my viewing pleasure. When will the Indian censorship board ever learn that they cannot f*** around with the audiences' feelings?",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Good movie with slightly disappointing ending,"I was going to rate Gone Girl with an eight but the five last minutes made me change my mind because I really thought the ending was disappointing. But the rest of the movie itself is really entertaining. Maybe a bit too long but still entertaining enough to keep you interested. Crime/mysteries are one of my favorite genre of movies, especially when you can't really figure out what happened until the end. With this one I figured it out really soon but it was still enjoyable to watch due to the good performances of Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike. Well, the whole cast was good actually except Neil Patrick Harris. I don't know why but I don't find him a good actor and he's quite irritable to watch.

David Fincher's Gone Girl is a complex thriller full of twists and turns.,"David Fincher's Gone Girl is a complex thriller full of twists and turns. Did he, didn't he, is she, isn't she? But then it deepens into something less predictable and altogether more surprising.Husband Ben Affleck gradually falls under suspicion of murder after his wife, Roasmund Pike, disappears. His responses and behaviour seem unexpected and that's all the media needs to both determine the crime and judge him guilty. His wife is portrayed as a perfect spouse while his character is subjected to ritual innuendo and suspicion.In fact, their relationship is far more complex, and much more disturbing, than we realise. Exploring the machinations of their marriage creates a compelling narrative as we begin to question what really happened, and who is guilty. The story suddenly answers our questions part way though and the narrative takes an even darker turn leaving us with something altogether more surprising.It's a film partly about image and perception. About how the media create a fiction to suit their own ends, which are happily and hungrily consumed by the public. It's also about the image we choose to present of ourselves, and the fictions we create individually.The two leads are exemplary. Affleck convinces as an ambivalent husband, and ensures that we question everything we see, until the film decides to provide the answers. Pike is a revelation in a complex role.It might be a vaguely preposterous story, but it's so well crafted in every sense that it probably won't matter. It'll glue you to your seat for the duration. Only afterwards might you consider the likelihood of such a tale.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Rosamund Pike's Breakthrough: She Was Fearless and Fearsome,"Five years ago, laidback Missourian Nick Dunne married gorgeous and smart New Yorker Amy. On their fifth wedding anniversary, Nick comes home to find their living room a big mess and his wife missing. Media hype hounds and persecutes him as police detectives turn up evidence that indicating that Nick killed Amy. Nick denies these allegations, but there seems to be no more way out for him.I was not a fan of Ben Affleck as an actor. I thought his best role was that of the ham actor in ""Shakespeare in Love"" because he was basically playing himself. In this film though, Ben Affleck actually does a great job essaying this role of Nick. His character needed to teeter between guilt and innocence, and Affleck effectively handled this tricky balance. We should not know how we should feel for him in the first act. But by the last act, the audience, especially the men, would feel his helplessness.I was also not a fan of Rosamund Pike. I thought she was just a pretty face but rather dull, icy and without passion when she acts. All that totally changed with her riveting performance as Amy. It is difficult to describe her performance without dropping a spoiler, so I have to stop right there. Suffice it to say, this performance is her breakthrough as a serious actress. It was fearless, and fearsome.David Fincher is an amazing director. I have been a fan since ""Se7en"". He had an amazing filmography since directing iconic videos of Madonna (""Express Yourself"") and Paula Abdul (""Straight Up"") back in the 1980s, including films like ""Fight Club"", ""Zodiac"",""The Social Network"", ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" and now this one. This guy just keep on improving in his aesthetics. I have not yet read the book by Gillian Flynn , who also wrote the screenplay, but the storytelling skills of Fincher were flawless in this film. It kept on surprising the audience up to the very end. His fluid style makes us look beyond certain plot details which may seem questionable or even absurd. He raises serious issues about the intricacies of a married relationship and sensationalization of crime by the media.""Gone Girl"" is the first film of the year that is seriously in contention for the major Oscar awards of this year.

A perfect start to Oscar season.,"Gone Girl is directed by David Fincher and stars Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike, Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry among others. It's based on the 2012 hit novel by Gillian Flynn (who also wrote the screenplay for the film), and follows Nick Dunne, a man whose wife suspiciously goes missing on their fifth wedding anniversary. Going into the theater, my heart was racing with excitement, and I had no doubt in my mind that this would be another fantastic hit from Fincher.Gone Girl is one of the best films of 2014 and an excellent start to Oscar season. This movie is intense, dramatic, but also refreshingly hilarious and mildly self referential and never takes itself too seriously. Affleck is great, but Rosamund Pike is a show stealer, and I predict an Oscar nom. Tyler Perry is perfect for his role, and I know this guy has talent, and should do more films like this. My only flaw lies within the acting and that is the character of Desi, played by Neil Patrick Harris. Was he bad? No, but I found it very hard to see him as anything but Neil Patrick Harris, with all his mannerisms and such.Gone Girl has twists left right and centre, so I was never bored during the 145 minute runtime. The dark, creepy tone is achieved by beautiful cinematography (as expected from Fincher) and the score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is still disturbing me as I write this, five days later, and I am certain it's their best score for a Fincher flick yet. By the time the end credits rolled, I was provoked to think hard about how media and press can effect one's life, and I felt like I was almost a little more socially informed. With the creepiness of Zodiac, lively screenplay of The Social Network, and twists and turns alike to Se7en, Gone Girl is a feast of Fincher goodness and I implore you to see it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"WOW!!! You want to be shocked/jaw drop, watch this!","MUST SEE movie if you love films with substance and enjoy thrillers/character pieces - no A.D.D mindless action (they showed Taken 3 during the previews, seriously!??!?)This is a VERY *CRAZY* and gripping movie. It's just INSANE. There was one scene where the whole theater just went completely silent... not one drop of sound... I think everyone just had their jaw open in disbelief, including myself.It really blew me away and most films these days don't do that for me. I was very engaged throughout the film... you don't really know who to feel sorry for.If you enjoyed PRISONERS, with Hugh Jackman, you will enjoy this too (yes, both films are almost 3 hours long, so if you can't sit still, it's not for you); they're both equally gripping, but it is more shocking.I felt some 50 Shades of Grey... There is nudity and sex in the film, so if you can't handle that, it's not for you.I have not read the book or knew anything about the film, so everything was fresh to me...Amazing performances and excellent casting. Rosamund Pike as AMY is perfect. Ben Affleck is good. Neil Patrick Harris... Wow, that was some interesting character...People like these DO exist, and that is what makes it frightening... Not zombies or ghosts.This movie blew me away. The story, performances, editing....This film proves amazing films can still be made today!!This film is scary in a whole new level. It's definitely a movie that will leave an imprint on your brain and want to keep discussing about the film.Highly recommended. It is a DARK film - it is a HEAVY thrill-ride experience. MUST SEE. GO SEE IT!",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
This film is utterly fantastic,"I went to see this film with a group of friends and just... Jesus Christ. This was the first movie in which I was legitimately squirming in my seat as I was watching it. Seeing Gone Girl for the first time was when I truly understood the concept of 'sitting on the edge of your seat'. While the movie starts off kind of slow it soon picks up. And when it picks up... you'll be in for a hell of a ride. It soon ends up taking you to a place you wouldn't think it would. The advertising for this film don't really do it justice. While it may first come across as just a typical chick-flick drama--believe me. It is SO much more than that. This film is truly amazing and made me realize that I admire David Fincher as a director. If you haven't seen Gone Girl yet, do your self a favor and fix that.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Smart story....but.......,"It was quite a smart script-writing by slowly changing viewers way to think. If you are a viewer that always took sides (bad side or good side), you may need more time to decide. Slowly by slowly, the characters are strengthened, and one last extreme scene concludes everything and then you would decide which side are you on. Both main characters have their own guilt, but a crime is still a crime, so to my opinion, need smarter plots to solid ended the movie, which was not there.A movie more than 120mins duration can sometimes be boring, but not this one, all the plots are quite necessary to be followed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
One of my favorite movies,"There are some movies that when they come on TV, I'll watch again and again. That's this movie.I would never say Ben Affleck is a great actor. I mean Ben basically plays Ben in all his movies. But he sure seems to pick good movies because I like most them. Or maybe I just like him.This movie has such a great story line and the actors are all very talented.Rosamund Pike really plays an evil plotting woman well. She's the woman you typical fear the most, one who knows how to hurt you badly without using a blunt object.It's a great thriller with a modern spin. Every scene is it's own little morsel. So when you watch on TV, it doesn't matter if you pick up in the middle, you just want to see it again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Thrilling, convincing and very realistic","One of the things I really liked about the film is that even by watching the trailers, interviews and critic ratings I still had no idea of what I was in for. Gone girl has to be one of the best, well directed, well casted films I have seen all year. I thought the dialogue was very unique, the acting was very convincing and it left me speechless when the end credits finally came up. 'Gone Girl' is a very good example about how people are treated in the media on a regular basis, and the way people are shown to the world and judged and how intimidating attention from show hosts, reporters and journalists can be and how it changes the way you look at people in the media. This is the first time I have seen Rosamund Pike in a film and I thought she did a brilliant job of recreating Amy. I loved the relationship between Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike and how well they created it for the big screen, both of their characters where extremely convincing and even though you feel like you shouldn't care about Nick near the start of the movie, as it gradually took off I really did care about Nick and that does say something about his character. The storyline was very unexpected in some cases, it was very gripping and interesting there was not one moment where I felt like it dragged or took a while to build.I seriously do not recommend watching this film on the first date though, but otherwise I think it is a film defiantly worth sitting through.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
masterpiece,Amy Dunne remains one of my all time favourite characters in cinema to this day. Her intelligence is unmatched and the 'Cool Girl' monologue changed LIVES. I adore films about angry women getting their revenge on those who have wronged them and this ticks all the boxes for me. The main characters are so well written and this movie makes me root for Amy from start to finish. It's so refreshing to see a calculated female character that portrays the traits in male dominated characters. Rosamunde Pike did a fantastic performance and the casting of Ben Affleck for Nick was perfect because he's so easy to hate hahaha.,10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Bold, intriguing, dark entertainer","Possibly, the most compelling reason to watch 'Gone Girl' in all its seriousness as a murder mystery is how it plays with your mind while being something else too. This isn't a reflection of today's society nor is it a thesis on failed marriages. Based on Gillian Flynn's popular novel and mostly adapted to screen by herself, this contemporary thriller is powered by a dueling narrative that doesn't permit the viewer to take sides for half the movie. Flynn's cinematic adaptation is smart and twisted enough for director David Fincher ('Se7en', 'Fight Club', 'Panic Room', 'Girl with the Dragon tattoo') to delineate his nimble ability with dark thrillers. He then uses his experience of 'The Social Network' and 'House of Cards' to provide a riveting drama that revolves around some powerful characters who face precarious and changing circumstances, neither of which are favorable to them.On the morning of their 5th anniversary, Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) comes home after sharing his sob story of a struggling marriage with his sister at their bar, only to learn of his wife Amy's (Rosamund Pike) mysterious disappearance. The lead detective's initial suspicions as well as the media's overbearing judgements quickly turn Nick into America's most hated man while he is still coming to term's with her disappearance. This is where the narrative draws excitement with its dual points of view. Nick's deeds and misdeeds provide one angle of what happens in the present while Amy's diary provides insight into their relationship and possibly, motive for her husband to have malcontent. The element of intrigue generated by these parallel points of view is certainly a result of the synergies between Flynn and Fincher. As guilt, suspicion and negligence become matters of public opinion, media toys with their presentation just as the film's characters, the writer and director tend to manipulate with your interpretation of what really occurs. The attitude of media and public might be the American way which seems overblown sometimes but the film doesn't propose absolute seriousness in that aspect anyway. Make no mistake, this is a commercial thriller and therefore, it does offer some clichés and some exaggerations.Hurt by the recession and with their recent move to a small town from NYC, the Dunnes are having more than just financial struggles. Nick's inability to turnaround his career's slide frustrates Amy whereas the constant nagging by her draws him further away from their relationship. With his wife's disappearance, Nick's life not only takes a shocking turn but the constant limelight by the media and public makes it tremendously challenging for him to move on. However, Ben Affleck's brilliant performance doesn't let you determine Nick's sincerity in the scenario. Underneath all the charm and innocence, is there truly a motivated killer or is there another side to the story? Amy's sincere narrative quickly draws the viewer's empathy and Rosamund Pike's sincere portrayal of this smart and beautiful writer is delightful to watch. She undergoes transitions both emotionally and physically through the storyline which is yet another portrayal of her commitment to the character. The supporting cast has some notable performances which include that of Neil Patrick Harris as Amy's creepy first boyfriend, Carrie Coon as Nick's extremely supportive twin and Kim Dickens as the lead detective whose systematic approach to the case requires her to be stern yet thoughtful as the mystery unravels. But with a commanding portrayal of the central character, Rosamund Pike leaves the lasting impression of surprise and delight about such underrated talent.Apart from being a psychologically manipulative thriller, 'Gone Girl' is actually quite an entertainer. There are amusing moments that play in satirical fashion especially when the media and public are overly concerned about missing Amy and how soon they begin to judge Nick's involvement in the disappearance. Then there's Pike's performance that showcases Amy's quick-wit that gently leads to dark humor. While the film maybe a tad bit long, it doesn't lose its grip over your intrigue and that must be attributed to the adroitly written novel and screenplay by Gillian Flynn. 'Gone Girl' may not be an Academy Award contender nor will it make superhero kind of money at the box-office but after a long time, it will be the movie that thoroughly entertained with its darkness, wit and sincere performances.8.232 on a scale of 1-10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

The Modernist master,"Version I saw: Showcase cinema screeningActors: 8/10Plot/script: 7/10Photography/visual style: 7/10Music/score: 7/10Overall: 8/10David Fincher is the most modern of directors, dealing with modern issues in a modern way, drawing from cinema's history but not bound by it.He also has a habit of drawing career-defining performances from actors. Both of these are much in evidence in Gone Girl. I was aware of Rosamund Pike as a very good British actress before, but this portrayal takes her to the next level.This is not to say that I like her character Amy. Almost all the characters in the film are pretty repugnant: much of Fincher's work appears to take the premise that there is darkness just under the skin of every human being who ever lived.The tone of the film is unnerving, and this is due in no small part to the score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, of Nine Inch Nails fame.The plot develops in some pretty lurid directions, to the extent that I wonder whether it harms or enhances the themes explored, mainly of the crass cynicism of modern fame. The main plot twist is a bit of a stretch too, but I went with it, and I am glad I did, because the end it leads to is quite outstanding.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
treading old ground,"A pass-the-time movie, occasionally gripping. Its origin in her novel is not particularly well disguised by the author's screenplay, with over-reliance on voice-overs. Her skill with dialogue, though, is excellent.The story has so many genre echoes (SUSPICION [1941], MARNIE, FATAL ATTRACTION, BASIC INSTINCT etc etc) that in spite of the plot's twists and turns it still feels as if it's treading old ground. The pace is often unhelpfully leisurely, whilst the last fifteen minutes feel over-compressed, as if all concerned wanted to make an even longer film but realised the thriller element would suffer if any extra length was added.Director David Fincher (SE7EN, FIGHT CLUB, ZODIAC), known for his dim, dark, moody shots, treads a line between style and stylistic tic. Personally I thought the look of the movie was needlessly indistinct.Ben Affleck ambles pleasantly through another of his Ordinary Guy roles. Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry offer competent support. But the film really belongs to three excellent women who shine in a trio of succulent roles: Carrie Coon as Mr Affleck's twin sister, Kim Dickens as a smart detective, and Rosamund Pike as the wife with hidden depths.In truth Ms Pike's bravura performance is the main reason to see GONE GIRL. She transcends the movie's limitations to dazzling effect.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Fincher doesn't make bad films,"I find David Fincher's films based on fiction (like Fightclub) more imaginative versus his non-fictional projects (Social Network), and I'd put him alongside today's top directors like Aronofsky and Nolan easily. Gone Girl (adapted from the novel by Gillian Flynn) touches on marriage/relationship themes like other notable films (Revolutionary Road, American Beauty, Eyes Wide Shut), but with deeper satire and an 'up to date' stance. Fincher has a way of reflecting the more interesting parts (and dark corners) of the collective consciousness (especially Americans) in a humorous way, sometimes veering towards an artistic activism of sorts (but its just 'entertainment' and simply pointing out issues will not magically make them go away). I wasn't sold on Rosamund Pike's performance until later in the film and it was nice to see a more raw and fanatical version of her than usual. This film's attitude and satire reminded me of films by Tarantino (Pulp Fiction), plus older films like Heathers (Michael Lehman) and Natural Born Killers (Oliver Stone). Gone Girl is ambitious in that it reaches for a wider audience in obvious and more subtle ways, infusing the 'law of reflection' to play with our minds (notably challenging our perception of who the antagonist is)- there are no 'winners', just human beings perceiving from their own experience (nicely balanced male and female point of view), resulting in a zero sum score. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross provide an appropriate and subtle soundtrack.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"marriage, family, society, media and crime","just finished the novel yesterday and freaking loved it and then watched the movie. it's a complicated narrative that will first bore you then excite you and the end flabbergast you. what is it about is easy enough to tell, a very bad and toxic relationship between tow very missed up people who grew up in very missed up/normal and happy looking families in a society that gets easily deceived. and in this relationship happens a mystery which proves how one dimensional and superficial the media's look at people's lives can be, which I'd like to highlight because I studied media.I think if the rule that the mass media played in this story can tell us something is that: if you're information about a certain subject comes only from TV then you probably know nothing, and if you're IQ equals the average IQ of the news anchors and talk show hosts in your country then you're in trouble.and the end I'd like to say that this is a great story and that every single one of the actors had done a great job.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Scathing Commentary on Power of the News Media; an Excellent Thriller,"David Fincher is, in my opinion, one of the most talented directors in modern Hollywood. I'm almost certain the man could tackle any project and create gold; for the record, I forgive him for ALIEN 3that was ruined by the studio, not him. GONE GIRL is what happens when Fincher dips his toe in the genre of Lifetime movies. Not surprisingly, it's way better than it probably should be. I was raised in a predominantly female household so I am very familiar with Lifetime and its brand of ""entertainment"", and I can't stand it. When I first read the premise of Fincher's GONE GIRL, I wasn't thrilled (it sounded sogeneric) but I was more than willing to give him a chance. He did not disappoint. GONE GIRL is the story of Nick (Ben Affleck) and Amy (Rosamund Pike) Dunne. We're guided through the beginning of their happy relationship and follow up through their marriage and eventual hardship during the economic recession. Things in the Dunne household seem shaky at best when the unthinkable occurs. Amy goes missing one morning, on the day of their fifth anniversary. There's evidence of a struggle and fears turn to those of kidnapping. The town rallies around Nick as the investigation becomes a national spectacle, but the media isn't being too friendly with Nick's, almost eerily calm, demeanor and secrets come to light that paint him in a horrible light. As the story unfolds in Fincher's creative fashion, we will learn: did Nick Dunne murder his wife?Even if the premise sounded depressingly generic, there was never a doubt that GONE GIRL would be a fantastically produced project. The cinematography, the music, the editingit's all got Fincher and crews' usual brand of excellence. The creative cutting and the structuring of the story into two very different halves is a fantastic bit of audience manipulation. We spend the first hour or so of the movie observing from one perspective as the investigation begins and the conservative fear-mongering news media (epitomized by Missi Pyle's Nancy Grace-esque Ellen Abbot) demonizes his every move. The evidence piles up and it becomes easier and easier to believe Nick might've killed his wife. Then the movie takes a drastic swing in the other direction. The truth about Amy's disappearance is way more twisted than Nick could've imagined. It all boils down the fact that Nick and Amy are one of the most messed up couples you'll ever meet. The flashbacks paint them in the usual light of your average struggling couple and GONE GIRL removes the sheen to reveal the insanity behind the scenes. The movie is an excellent piece of work and another success under Fincher's direction, even if it doesn't achieve the level of his greats (e.g. THE SOCIAL NETWORK, SE7EN, etc.). All of the elements come together to create a tense movie that grabs hold of you because you can't wait to see how it's all resolved in the end, and the pitch perfect casting makes it all the better.Ben Affleck gets a lot of hate and I never quite understood it. He's done some garbage but most in Hollywood have. He's also done a lot of great stuff, both behind and in front of the camera. He's excellent in GONE GIRL. He's already got a vibe that makes him come across as kind of arrogant and aloof; it plays into the character of Nick as one of his major flaws that contributes to the public's growing mistrust of him. I was somewhat familiar with Rosamund Pike, primarily from DIE ANOTHER DAY (I won't hold that against her) and her supporting role in Edgar Wright's THE WORLDS END. She is 100% awesome in GONE GIRL. Amy is an incredibly complex character (for reasons I won't spoil here) and Pike handles it flawlessly. She's sympathetic, intelligent, beautiful, and, when he true nature begins to surface, she's terrifying. As the key characters in this movie, Affleck and Pike and perfectly cast. The supporting cast is equally powerful with Kim Dickens and Carrie Coon standing out. Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry both play against type to outstanding results; Harris as a skeevy, rich former flame of Amy's that hasn't quite let go of the past, and Perry as a hot-shot New York lawyer who's earned a reputation representing husbands with their head on the chopping block. GONE GIRL is a character-driven movie and the cast is at their best to keep the movie, at a whopping 2.5 hours, moving at a break-neck pace. Easy recommend as one of the better movies of 2014, and I can't wait to see Fincher's next.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Another stylistic masterpiece from David Fincher,"David Fincher's career has been defined by grim, bleak productions with an underlying dark sense of humour, and 'Gone Girl' is no exception. While not as good as the likes of 'Se7en' and 'Fight Club', 'Gone Girl' is still an excellent production, and up there with the year's best films.The initial premise of the film is whether Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) has murdered his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike). However, the film takes multiple plot twists and turns, making the matter much more complicated than it initially appears.The two leads are fantastic, but Pike is the real highlight, flawlessly portraying a woman who has some serious relationship problems to say the least. A potential Best Actress nominee.Other stand-out performers include Neil Patrick Harris, who takes a rare serious role without any difficulty, as well as Tyler Perry as idiosyncratic defence attorney Tanner Bolt.'Gone Girl' carries on Fincher's current tradition of a highly polished visual style juxtapositioned with its morbid subject matter, complimented by its crisp editing and cinematography.Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, who provided the soundtrack for both 'The Social Network' and 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' are likewise a familiar addition, with the score provided by them being mostly minimalist, yet perfectly tied-in to the on-screen occurrences and the film's grim tone.As an adaptation of the popular 2012 novel, 'Gone Girl' doesn't disappoint, removing certain elements that are superfluous or unnecessary, yet still strictly sticking to the unique plot structure and maintaining the novel's cynical view of marriage and long-term relationships. It would seem that Fincher and author/screenwriter Gillian Flynn are a match made in cinematic heaven.Highly-recommended viewing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
David Fincher darkens an already cryptic story,"David Fincher is a master craftsmen when it comes to the thriller genre. As a lover of the novel, I have to say the movie not only stays true to it's material, but also enhances the mood. Through his lighting and shadow techniques, he shows inner turmoil and degradation. Fincher cuts through scenes like a butcher, but the beautiful cinematography makes the cuts precise. His yellow-sepia to black and white contrasts are breathtaking. Without any dialogue, you could follow the film completely by color and lighting alone. But the film doesn't stop there. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross create, ""creepy elevator music"", that eats at you and makes you cringe at every scene like ""nine inch nails"" on a chalkboard. The acting is also superb. Rosamund Pike delivers a performance that will be talked about and analyzed for years to come. She could start a whole new outlook on female roles forever. Affleck has never been better, and is the perfect casting choice for the ""average"" guy. Tyler Perry, Neil Patrick Harris, and Carrie Coon are possibly the best supporting cast I've witnessed yet in a modern thriller.

Changing Perceptions,"+Clear, crisp cinematography +Beautiful score +Engaging Story -Unacknowledged plot holes -Questionable endingIf you are familiar with David Fincher's work, you are well aware that his films can be dark, seducing, and engaging. Gone Girl is no exception. Similar to Fincher's previous films such as Zodiac and Seven, there are twists and turns all around the bend with this one. It is only lackluster in some areas of the film that (while I am not spoiling here) the movie itself appeared to ignore. Mostly what I suggest is contained in the final hour of this film. It is as if the movie only ignored these more than likely probabilities when a certain character took serious action.DELIVERY: Fincher yet again pulls his audience in with a beautiful score of ambiance by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. It fits the storytelling style of cinema better than ever. Every shot in this movie looks smooth which gives a clear delivery to the viewer of the modern day dilemma Affleck faces in this more than bizarre crisis. All of the acting feels spot on. Rosamund Pike gives a standout performance.STORY: The two and a half hour run time might feel like a push for this story in particular, but it feels necessary due to its story arch. While it is difficult for me to describe the specifics of this story without giving out spoilers, it uses a flashback system for basically the first half of this film. This film benefits so much from this story because the perceptions viewers have on the characters. I have never felt my opinions and anticipations change so quickly in a film. While it is on the longer side, the conflict of the film changes so instantly. It is almost unbelievable. In fact at some points, it is unbelievable. While this is a fantasy story and a situation of this magnitude has never occurred in today's society, some events that take place might pull the viewer out of the story and think ""How could the film possibly ignore this?"" It basically leaves these problems behind and transitions to another issue before you can blink.ENDING(NO SPOILERS): The ending of this film may make happy ending lovers walk out empty handed. Fincher is known for not tying a happy bow on the end of his films (for the most part), and Gone Girl has probably become the best example of his films to date in this department. Not many times does a movie watcher question the protagonist's actions at the end of the film, and this movie really makes me question Affleck's logic before the credits.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"

Human psyche borehole,"First of all - I absolutely love this movie. However I don't view it as a thriller as much as a deep psychological drama dealing with a wide range of issues faced in ANY human relationship. It's just dressed as a ""mystery/thriller"" which in its own way is a master pun as well.I have heard many of my friends dismissing this movie as a little above average mystery thriller evaluating it along the lines of slow and predictable, yet usually entertaining. I think this is a huge misconception of this work of art, the thriller/mystery thing is just the outer layer, there are many more layers underneath in each and every scene and I'm very surprised people miss it. We are reminded about it at the very beginning by the first scene. The movie deals with the 3 simple questions posed at the opening scene. It actually is trying to unspool the brains of the main couple and get to the bottom of human relationships, not necessarily a marriage.If you try and watch the movie through this prism, which is I think what the creators intended, you'll find a deep, thought provoking probe into the peculiar and intertwined web of little human actions of which human relations are made.I don't want to go into any details here but I think everything (and I mean everything from camera angles through cats to the colors) has it's own purpose and meaning along the above mentioned lines.Yes, human relationships, marriage, friendship, fleeting love affairs are in fact thrillers because we are always a mystery to each other.

The Vidiot Reviews...,"Gone GirlIf your wife ever goes missing be sure to put her photo on the sides of skim milk cartons only.Unfortunately, the husband in this drama is too detached to care.When beloved children's book inspiration Amazing Amy (Rosamund Pike) disappears on her 5th wedding anniversary, her husband Nick (Ben Affleck) becomes the prime suspect.Condemned on cable news networks as a wife-killer, Nick's aloofness, and his secret affair, draws further aspersions of guilt.However, the true fate of Amy is more shocking than her initial vanishing, and subsequent return.While Affleck does an outstanding job as the deadbeat spouse, it's Pike's restrained performance as Amy that really brings this alarming adaptation of the best-selling book to life.Shrewdly directed by David Fincher, Gone Girl is a complex and cunning commentary on marriage, murder and media sensationalism.Incidentally, doing interviews in your missing wife's clothing doesn't gain you public favor.Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Very original, with few flaws.","This is a very original story for the genre of murder-mystery. The clichés are limited to the individual moments, versus the greater story.However, it tends to become stale halfway into the movie, due the fact the movie's main question is answered and we are left wondering, ""what's next?""The style of the film is beautiful and Fincher does a great job managing the performances. Hats off to Ben Affleck for his subtle and believable performance.Overall, a great contribution to the genre.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
"Good premise, bad acting a and terrible plot","The one is because the high score, the movie is not that terrible and some entertainment value. Maybe a 4/10 is more appropriate. I found Ben Affleck acting was quite bad. I didn't care much about any of the characters but maybe the lead investigator.. But not much time is actually spent on the police work anyway.The plot is just to impossible/incredible and the twists are just too convenient and stupid. Ultimately you don't really care about what is happening because the Husband character is flat and Ben seems completely disconnected with the events that happen to him... He seems to not give 2 s****. Why would he have married this psycho without noticing anything? I don't know, and I don't care.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Some Great Performances Paper Over Plot Holes,"I had heard good things about this movie, in fact more than good things. So given that I don't hate Ben Affleck like some do, I'm a fan of Neil Patrick Harris and David Fincher is an excellent director, who has directed some great movies, I had every reason to believe this would be as superb as I hoped.Plot In A Paragraph: When his wife's disappearance becomes the focus of an intense media circus, bar owner Nick Dunne sees the spotlight turned on him when it's suspected that he may not actually be innocent.Whilst I enjoyed the movie, it had more than a few ridiculous plot holes which ruined it a bit for me. But ignoring those problems, the acting is what makes this movie. Ben Affleck is great as the tortured husband, Rosamund Pike is perfect as Amy Dunne the missing wife, as always Neil Patrick Harris is brilliant (when is he not??) Tyler Perry, Connie Coon, Kim Dickens and Emily Ratajkowski all offer solid support.Special praise needs to be mentioned of the score too, as its perfect for this movie. Not as good as I'd hoped, but still worth watching thanks to some tour de force acting from its strong cast.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
Ben Affleck's best role,"This is a slow, tense film that takes viewers into the lives of some deeply disturbed people. If you're looking for humor, action, fast- pacing, or are bothered by in-depth studies of messed up people, then you won't enjoy this movie.Casting Ben Affleck was a stroke of genius. Is he innocent? Is he a murderer? You never know due to his blank, expressionless face. Ben Affleck's terrible acting is ideal for this role.Rosamund Pike was absolutely amazing, and nailed her character. It's well worth watching just for her performance.Every supporting actor is well-chosen and hardly ever interferes with suspension of disbelief.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
An Electrifying Thriller That Delivers Hard,"Adapted from Gillian Flynn's best-selling suspense novel, Gone Girl is a film sealed with dramatic intensity and highly intellectual storytelling. Its manner of plot development is highly intricate and always has a sense of morbidity lying underneath. Every plot twist is so well crafted that it is never seen coming. That is, of course, unless you've read the novel. Gillian Flynn wrote the screenplay herself and has made few changes to the big-screen adaptation, so fans of the novel won't be surprised by the story. However, they will undoubtedly enjoy watching this mind- consuming and grisly tale come to life.Directed by the iconic David Fincher, one can already expect broodingly dark undertones and gorgeously vivid cinematography. He has a taste for grim tales about death or deception, such as Se7en and The Game, and this extends to the book adaptations he's directed: Fight Club, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and Zodiac. Being the well-seasoned director that he is, it was inevitable for Gone Girl to be anything but gripping and cinematically exquisite both at once.Discussing Gone Girl feels like having to slowly peel a story apart without taking too much away. Even events that must be mentioned feel like spoilers in-and-of-themselves, and as any reader, you're only getting about half the story unless you've already seen the film. At any rate, Gone Girl is a fast-paced thriller that keeps you glued from the start and also manages to make a statement on gender roles, marriage, and psychological instability, all underlying the complexity and psychopathy of the tale.We first meet Nick Dunne on the morning of his fifth wedding anniversary. He starts his day off by going to a bar and drinking with the bartender, whom we soon learn is his twin sister, Margo, and the two co-own the bar—named The Bar. Oh, the meta-originality. Nick seems tense but keeps a mundane composure around his sister. He then receives a phone call from a neighbor warning him of an occurrence at Nick's home. He rushes home to find the door open—with his cat sitting patiently outside—and enters cautiously, calling out for his wife, Amy. She is nowhere to be found.Nick soon enters the living room in which a glass table is overturned and broken, alarming him as he immediately calls the cops. He cooperates with them as they arrive and is truthful about his morning and the events leading up to Amy's disappearance. After an interrogation in which he reveals that his wife has no friends and is a distant person, he advises her family of her disappearance. Vigils are held with large posters claiming ""MISSING"" in boldface, with a smiling Amy underneath along with a hotline number. It is not long before the media becomes engrossed in the case, with one female news anchor in particular bashes Nick for his apathetic looks at the vigils, implying he is careless about Amy's disappearance and may have well murdered her.It is now important to discuss two details regarding the film. Firstly, as a tradition, Amy would leave three clues for Nick to find his gift on their anniversary—a treasure hunt. For investigative purposes, the police follow Nick through the treasure hunt to retrace Amy's steps before the attack took place. A riddle has to be solved at each location, where there are clues on clearly marked envelopes: Clue 1. Clue 2. Clue 3. The second aspect of the film is that it is told in two narratives. We follow Nick and the chaos that ensues from his inner demons as the media swoops in and tears him apart. However, from the start, we are also following Amy's recollection of her marriage to Nick in the form of a diary. We see her retell everything from the day they met, to their marriage troubles, to her eventual fear of Nick harming her. The cops, of course, find this diary as evidence.And alas, this is as much as I can give you of Gone Girl. At the end of it all, it is a stunning film that has easily made my top-5 list of 2014 favorites. There is never a shot wasted with its darkly beautiful scenery, and every detail is presented before you and knows exactly where it is taking you. Gone Girl is a disturbing yet effective film as a social commentary on commitment and how far we are willing to stretch our morals.(for more of my film rants, follow me on twitter @calcium_waste)",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
The Gone Girl Impact,"When Gone Girl, starring Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike, was over and the lights in the theater were starting to slowly brighten, I was unable to get up from my seat. What had just occurred in front of me was, well incredible. I had never seen a film before that was so predictable but not. The mystery drew me in but the intensity is what kept me there. With every passing minute I was clutching my seat, widening my eyes, and waiting (very impatiently) for events to be explained. The movie starts with Nick Dunne (Affleck) starting the day of his fifth wedding anniversary to his wife, Amy Dunne (Pike), at a bar. There he talks to his sister, the bartender, about the struggles he is experiencing in his marriage. When he gets a call from one of his neighbors that his cat was outside of his house, he rushes home. There he not only finds the cat but the front door is open with nothing in the house to be found other than what looks like a struggle in the living room with a broken coffee table and flipped over furniture. When Nick goes looking for his wife in the house he cannot find her and automatically calls the police. As the police start to uncover hidden details in Nick and Amy's life, including Amy's diary of secrets, the finger is pointed at Nick. As the film goes on you cannot help but try to solve the mystery that writer Gillian Flynn set up, however the plot has so many twist and turns that it is nearly impossible to keep up. Director David Fincher uses a lot of key lighting to enhance drama and suspense. The use of color in Amy's diary to represent different entries is also very telling in the long run. This film is the best film I have seen all year and it is because of the strong and intense actors, Affleck and Pike, and also because of the production and delivery of the film its self. It was clear that every detail from lighting to sound to camera shots was put together with precision and thought. I find the scariest films to be about what could really happen in what seems an ordinary life, and for Nick and Amy, the nightmare has just begun.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery"
