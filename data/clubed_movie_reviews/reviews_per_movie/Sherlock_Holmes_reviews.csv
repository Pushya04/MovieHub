It saddens me ...,"... not the movie, but the number of self-professed Holmes aficionados who apparently have no knowledge of Holmes. For the record, Holmes was a miserable, irresponsible drug addict who did indeed sleep on the floor, insult his best friend, experiment on his dog, and never ever wore a deerstalker's cap (at least, not until television was invented). He was a brawler who practiced martial arts and was as likely to slum around in the filthiest of rags as he was a suit.It wasn't until after Doctor Watson took him in hand that he truly refined himself and became a ""respectable"" member of society. And yes, we can tell that this movie takes place THAT early in their relationship because Watson has not yet married his wife (the retconning did annoy me, too, by the way, but you just can't avoid a little re-imagining here and there).Speaking of unavoidable, Irene Adler, Holmes' one uncapturable (is that a word?), simply had to be cast as a potential love interest. The flirting, the romance, and the near-make-out session were irresistible to the director (and to all of the audience who're honest with themselves).That being said, I felt Robert Downey, Jr. played Sherlock Holmes to perfection. His characteristic caustic attitude towards Lestrade and even Watson at times was exactly how I'd imagine him. He gives several summations of his observations and deductions that brought Holmes to life in an almost unparalleled way. His fight scenes (preceded the first few times by superhuman calculations) show both the mental and physical sides of Holmes in ways that Watson's notes can't quite convey, but at which they constantly hint.As for Watson himself, Jude Law delivered a wonderful performance. I was a little skeptical of how well he fought, given Watson's wartime injury, but his character and demeanor were entirely on the nose. His loyalty to Holmes despite his frustrations with him could not have been captured more expertly, I feel. No one, no matter how patient or forgiving, could endure Holmes forever without the occasional confrontation. The original Holmes, after all, was not above insulting his best friend or even deriding his deductive capabilities at times. Nevertheless, Watson never could abandon his friend in his time of need.This version (or vision, if you will) of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's greatest creation may be more swashbuckling, more thrilling, and more edgy than any other incarnation, but that doesn't make it any less faithful to the original. Aside from a little revisionist history in the cases of the female leads, nothing is that far out of the ordinary; and no amount of references to Madonna will change that.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Hugely enjoyable, I seriously wasn't expecting to enjoy it as much as I did","First of all, I wasn't sure whether I wanted to see this movie initially. It looked entertaining enough, but I was wondering is it going to be an entertaining and stylish movie or another generic block buster? My answer is this, and you can probably tell by my summary, I thoroughly enjoyed it, it is not the best movie I have ever seen and it has its faults, but the thing is I thought it was fun, witty and somewhat original too.Those who didn't like it as much as I did will probably question whether I have any knowledge at all of Sherlock Holmes, whether it is the books or the countless interpretations of the character and his stories. The answer is yes, I really like Conan Doyle's stories, they are clever and insightful and Holmes himself is a very intriguing character with a distinct personality, and I am a fan of both Basil Rathbone and Jeremy Brett. If I had a preference I would say the latter but only marginally, Rathbone was excellent, he was sophisticated and gritty but Brett had that towering presence and generosity about him that made me like him a little more.Back to this film, I liked how it was filmed. I for one found it stylish, innovative and clever. The camera work is really good, even in the fight scenes which were suitably gritty and invigorating, and the sets, costumes and locations look as though they took their time with it and to make it true to the period. I also enjoyed the score, it was jaunty and somewhat tongue-in-cheek. Guy Ritchie's direction is solid as well, it is tight, assured and Ritchie does seem to know what he is doing, so we were treated to some fun set pieces.The pacing was fine for me, in fact although people may disagree I for one was surprised at how quickly in general the film went, even if it did slow down towards the end. The script was very witty and smart, there were a number of times when my whole family and I laughed, and a lot of it was Holmes's dialogue, plus I liked the idea of the plot, it was an original (if a little convoluted at times) and it moved along briskly. I will talk later about what didn't quite work, but in particular the final solution is interesting. It may be one you need to rewind a few times in order to completely understand though. I also think it was a good idea to put Moriaty as a background character, the ending is highly suggestive of a sequel, and if there is one that would be a perfect opportunity for Moriaty to flourish with the right actor, some good dialogue and some good character development.Finally the acting. In general, I was really impressed. Robert Downey Jnr, an actor who I like a lot, gives a very strong performance as Holmes. He plays Holmes as an avid boxer, as a keen martial artist, as intelligent being a master of logic and deduction and as a master of disguise, while tormenting his housekeeper in a playful manner and sometimes acting as selfish and self-destructive. Downey Jnr. delivers his lines pretty much brilliantly, sometimes saying them quite quickly, especially when Holmes is deducting but I loved his deadpan delivery. Jude Law is perfect as Watson, he plays him as young, intelligent, authoritative and there are some great moments when he tells Holmes off. The two do share a unique and effortless chemistry together and that really showed on screen and one of the reasons why the film was so enjoyable for me. Another strong performance is Mark Strong as Blackwood, a real villain he is, mysterious, cold, dark, suave yet charismatic yet deserving of one or two more scenes, and I liked Eddie Marsan's Inspector Lestrade.Despite all these strengths there were two primary weaknesses. While the plot was great and moved along briskly, there were some scenes that came across as rushed and unexplained, especially when Holmes and Watson save Irene Adler from being killed in the factory, that just felt like an action set piece and little else. Rachel McAdams I didn't like so much as Irene. She looks really pretty, with the lovely authentic hair style and her dresses were eye popping, especially the pinkish-red one which suited her perfectly, but acting-wise she looks stiff and unconvincing in her part.Overall, just plain fun. Whether you see it or not is up to you, if you don't like it that's fine, this film's not for everyone. But I am going to conclude to say I loved it, it was entertaining and smart. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Sherlock Holmes retold......or a reliable adaptation.,"How many of us that adore the world of Sherlock Holmes, don't romanticise about the stunning Jeremy Brett series, or the modern dizzying cleverness of the Benedict Cumberbatch series.This film would have come as a massive surprise to both sets of fans. First off the visuals, it's a breathtaking affair, it's atmospheric and gothic, the blockbuster feel works incredibly well. Secondly, the humour, it's packed full of laughs, lots of witty lines and plenty of sarcasm. Thirdly, the acting, is tremendous, Downey and Law are sublime, it's a great cast.Overall, it's taken me some time to get used to it, initially I loathed it, as time has developed I've grown to enjoy it, and now cannot wait for the third film.The core essence of Holmes is actually captured here, plenty of what's in the books is brought to life, the darkness of the character, we're not given a member of the social elite, but a troubled, charismatic, fantastic slob.My only real issue is the plot itself, which is perhaps the most over the top element here, and that's saying something, enjoyable, but a little hard to follow.Crazy, complicated and fun, not my idea of Holmes, but a fun watch nonetheless. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"""Death is only the beginning.""","A+If there is one genre I began to detest over the years, it was the 'buddy-action' flicks. You know the movies where two guys who aren't exactly friends are forced to form an uneasy alliance which leads to hilarious escapades. It's only been done a thousand and one times, note the long line of duos: Bruce Willis & Samuel L. Jackson (""Die Hard 3""), Will Smith & (""Wild Wild West""), Chris Tucker & Jackie Chan (""Rush Hour""), and let's not forget Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson (""Shanghai Knights""). Though many (but certainly not all) of the aforementioned films are indeed funny, few have any real lasting qualities and even fewer a challenging storyline. The best they can often do is throw an alluring female co-star between the two leads, but I digress.This film however, stands a monumental achievement. Firstly, the cast is really something else. Robert Downey Jr. as our titular character, and he does a bang up job playing a man who's a mystery in himself. Jude Law is entertaining and I'm glad Eddie Marsan was aboard. Mark Strong makes for a very impressive antagonist, and Rachel McAdams is a seductive femme fatale of sorts. The gloomy setting, 1800s London, couldn't be better realized and it definitely gives the film a darker tone.Most importantly though, the story is truly a one-of-a-kind detective tale. It really is a pitting of rationality vs. superstition, and to my heart-thumping exhilaration for the majority of the film you would think good old logic had been defeated. Moving on before I spoil anything. The plot twists and turns menacingly, and leaves one astounded by the effort put into the writing.Lastly, kudos to composer Hans Zimmer who did a very catchy leitmotif that fit the film perfectly. The gray-blue cinematography is great, and I've got to congratulate Guy Ritchie on his feat.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Actor, and Placement","Somehow, i've always avoided the cinematic (or TV) presentations of Sherlock Holmes. I find the character fascinating, but i always felt it was more invested in literature, not cinema. His deductions, the way he surrounds the worlds he investigates are a feast for thinking minds. Even when the deductions are over the top (which happens often!) one can't stop smiling at the cleverness. More than that, the character is a perfect piece invested in a clever, irresistible and fascinating world. London. That part is visual, and a good ground to invest a cinematic world. But, unlike for example anything by Agatha Christie, Doyle's cleverness is rooted in pure deductive logic, not on the mechanics of the world. Notice that Christie's crimes are many times a matter of understanding how things happened, spatially (murder on the orient express is the zenith of that). I suppose Doyle formed his mind before cinema had any significant impact on how our minds work.So the challenge for any modern filmmaker, and actor, who wants to update Holmes, is to make the character more cinematic, more appealing. Several tricks are used here, most of them successful, even if straightforward. One is the most obvious, making Holmes an action character (which actually is in its original dna, even though TV productions usually ignore that). This might be a flop, and make the version laughable, but by now there is a sense of irony and self awareness in Ritchie's films (sincer Lock Stock) that allows him to support a xxi century action figure in Holmes clothing that actually is watchable. A minor trick here is the association of the deduction with the very process of physical fighting, which creates some Matrix moments. Well, their watchable, though not particularly interesting. In the greater arc, there are good action sequences, because, as any competent action these days, considers the elements of the surrounding space, and uses them.But there are two big things in this film, which take it to new levels of interest.One is the acting. Jude Law is a clever guy, an interesting actor whose greatest quality is how he merges anonymously with the context he is intended to integrate. He willingly becomes a piece of a larger tapestry, and that really is something to look upon. There are not many actors who can claim they can do this competently. But the king of the game is Downey Jr. He is the gold piece in the puzzle of updating Holmes. There certainly will be a before-after Holmes character, with this film. The man is capable to work his performances on several directions, and each of them is a perfect link to its surroundings. So he gives in to Ritchie's demands, and introduces humour, irony, and self-awareness in the character, to make it usable for the director's winks at ironic action. He invests totally on the creation of a character who merges with the textures of the context, while being distinct from it. And while doing it, he folds us into his game, so we do everything with him, side by side. We deduce, we smile, we run, all with him. So, if the film hadn't other qualities, Downey Jr would still make it worthy, because he, alone, solves one the most basic problems with any film: to find a channel audiences can safely cross into the game someone (director) proposes. He is one of the best ever.But there is another great thing here, which i suspect has a lot to do with several guys involved in the process of making the film. The result is an incredible sense of placement. London, XIXth century. All those dirty muddy streets, all the dirt. The fascination of the inner locations, namely the midget's laboratory. How those sets are usable, in the action scenes. That's all competent, more than competent. It's perfectly rendered, carefully photographed, it sounds overly artificial, but it's a matter of taste, i suppose. But what was really striking was the use of the London bridge. Notice how it is announced, early in the film, with a similar perspective to the one we'll get in the end. Than, the great sequence, when Irene Adler goes through the sewage, goes up, and we end up with a close up of her, in an unidentified location. The angle opens, we move away, and we are set up in the location for the final fight scene, which in its own merits is interesting enough. So, this was a unique way to actually use an establishing location, instead of merely showing it. I mean, how many films have shown the Eiffel towers? countless. How many actually use it? not so many. This is one of the best London cities we've seen lately.My opinion: 4/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
As the Crow Flies,"Greetings again from the darkness. Great literature seldom makes for great cinema. The mediums are vastly different. However great literature, in the right hands, can make for very entertaining cinema. Such is the case with Guy Ritchie's interpretation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's greatest character.Mr. Ritchie provides us with quite a departure from the Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce ""Holmes and Watson"". Here we get dazzling special effects and near super-human feats and stunts. Another twist is that this Holmes here is no meticulous, fastidious bore in real life. In fact, he lives more like a frat boy or rock star - replete with trashed room and bouts of isolation.What is not missing is Holmes' world class attention to detail. The story here is multi-layered and actually very interesting, if not a bit high-minded and high-concept. The still-under-construction Tower Bridge plays a role in the film and the bleakness and gray of London is captured perfectly.Of course, I won't reveal any details of the story other than to say the ""good"" guys are out to get a real bad guy here ... wonderfully played by the always solid Mark Strong, who may or may not be dead. That always makes for an interesting case! Support from Rachel McAdams and Eddie Marsan are fine, but Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law are the real stars as Holmes and Watson. As odd as it seems, they really do have a buddy factor that works well on screen. Downey's physicality has always set him apart from many contemporary actors ... he moves like a dancer and fights like a champion. Jude Law is often too pretty-boy for me, but he really does a nice job of capturing the reluctant sidekick with complimentary skills.This is a BIG movie! It is made to be a rollicking good time with tons of popcorn munched. Smaller kids will not be able to follow the story, but anyone who has read a Holmes story (and isn't against a little artistic license) should see the film. It is extremely entertaining and fun to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Downey and Law are on the case,"Do Guy Ritchie and Sherlock Holmes fit? Why, it's elementary my dear movie fan. This is one of the most entertaining thrillers of the year and the fantastic Downey Jr. and Law are a big part of the reason why. They take top honors as the years best bro-mance, arguing like an old married couple while deep down knowing that they'd be lost without each other. Downey is Holmes and Law is sidekick Dr. Watson, embroiled in a plot where the black-magic-practicing Lord Blackwood (a perfectly grave and menacing Mark Strong) has risen from the dead after being sentenced to hang. Rachel McAdams also shows up as Irene Adler, the only criminal who has ever gotten the best of Holmes.Downey Jr. brings quick-wit, cunning, and a scruffy toughness to a role long seen as stuffy and dry, while Law a distinguished charm that, at times, spills over into testy aggressiveness (which is funniest at Holmes most annoying). Both toss off the one-liners with ease. Ritchie's directorial style also comes through, from the dark, grimy Victorian- London production values to the violent boxing and martial arts matches. Holmes' mindset (such as the steps he takes to neutralize a suspect, interpret clues, follow the deceptive) also brings out Ritchie's ability to create an ultra-stylized flashback. There are also a few really thrilling action set-pieces involving a boat and an unfinished bridge. The plot, by three screenwriters, is a little on the convoluted side but it gets the job done with plot-twist on-top of plot twist. With all the brutal violence and style, you can be sure this isn't your Grandpa's Sherlock Holmes, but it will have you drooling for a sequel nonetheless.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

"A Fun Ride, Even For An Old Rathbone-Bruce Fan Like Me","I stayed away from this for a long time because I'm an old codger who loves the old Basil Rathbone-Nigel Bruce Sherlock Holmes movies and from the trailer, I thought this was going to be another far-out Robert Downey Jr. flick that would be more science fiction/FX movie than a good Holmes mystery. Well, it was....BUT the movie was still very entertaining and I really liked it......and I'd certainly watch it again.Yeah, it was a little weird seeing Holmes and Watson duking it out numerous times like they were members of The Expendables, but once that was accepted, I could settle back and enjoy the action, the dialog, the special effects, the fascinating characters and sharp picture and visuals, making it all surprisingly-fun ride. All the major characters in here were very entertaining, and all the while, Holmes still retained his incredible powers of deduction, which were a hoot to hear.So, for older people who expect a very sedate Holmes and Watson, either skip the film or loosen up and just be ready for two hours of wild entertainment.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Visually stylish, otherwise totally bland","As with most of Hollywood ""blockbuster"" cinema these days, the film suffers from an inescapable, one-dimensionalism. It is all about style; the cinematography, costuming, digital sets and effects, etc. are all top notch. As well, the quippy dialogue betrays a certain shallow, slick stylism that the script suffers from in general. However, far from being a clever distillation of the best of Holmes and Watson, the film instead suffers throughout from a post-modernistic reductionism that flattens our heroes into effete, world-weary caricatures of their literary counterparts.In a nutshell, for Holmes enthusiasts particularly, the film--in spite of the stylishly depicted action sequences--is dull and soulless, almost as if bored with its own pointlessness. Telling of our times, perhaps, but far from great storytelling.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
'Sherlock Holmes' is a Fast-Paced Whirlwind Adventure,"-----It came as a surprise when Guy Ritchie was chosen as the Director of 'Sherlock Holmes.' Known primarily for his work on indie crime films, such as 'Snatch' or last year's 'RocknRolla,' Ritchie had never taken on a mainstream franchise film, the likes of which 'Sherlock Holmes' promised to be. Thankfully, Ritchie was able to mesh the two genres on some level, with his trademark style of film-making ever present in his latest outing. The result is a film that will surely prove the most popular take on the character outside of Conan Doyle's original novels, and will also likely spawn a franchise.-----Sherlock Holmes and his partner Dr. Watson have been successfully solving cases throughout England for years. Their most recent case was that of Lord Blackwood, a man who murdered in the name of his black magic. Finally hanged for his crimes, it comes as an unpleasant surprise when he literally rises from his grave. And so it is up to Holmes and Watson to find him and stop him before his killing spree devours the whole of England.-----Robert Downey Jr. is right at home in the role of the infamous detective. Swapping out futuristic armor for a pipe and fiddle, he plays another character with the wit and confidence of his Tony Stark persona in 'Iron Man.' This makes sense because, to some degree, what is 'Sherlock Holmes' if not merely the Tony Stark character set back about a hundred years? Regardless, Downey Jr. is excellent, providing an effervescent wit and supreme charm to his latest role. Jude Law plays his right hand man, Dr. John Watson, in a role much smarter than past incarnations of the Watson character. The two are more equals than hero and sidekick, and their chemistry is indelible. Even when the narrative becomes a bit erratic, the pleasure of seeing the two stars' continuous verbal quarrels is worth the price of admission alone. Together they inspire numerous laughs and clever rebuttals to an unrelenting degree, allowing many of the jokes to pass unrealized, saved for the treat of a second viewing.-----'Sherlock Holmes' has a method completely reminiscent of Director Guy Ritchie's earlier films. In the style of show first-explain later, Ritchie has effectively applied his trademark fast cuts to the mind of his lead protagonist. Much as Watson is often catching up to Holmes' various schemes, so must the audience sit in question for a large portion of the film, waiting for Holmes to reveal his motivations. Particularly similar to his work on last year's entertaining 'RocknRolla,' along with many of his other films, Ritchie takes the first hour of his endeavors laying out the dots to be connected in his lengthy but fast-paced crescendo throughout the second half of the film. With 'Holmes,' he has compromised nothing, rather managed to find a better balance between build up and climax. With various fistfight intervals dissecting the chaotic mystery, Ritchie keeps the audience entertained even when they're unsure about the direction of the plot. That being said, many viewers will begin to question their purchase throughout the films first half hour, as the story puzzles more than entertains. But rest assured, a satisfying finale follows, with so many pieces coming together that a second viewing is a necessity to begin dissecting the intricacies of the case being solved, if that only means better understanding Holmes' course of action.-----Visually Ritchie has constructed a film in the shadows, only occasionally getting out into spanning shots of daylight England. This, like the rest of the film, settles into place as the film develops. His infamous lightning cuts allow no slow moments, even when the pace would typically meander in the hands of a lesser Director. Holmes also riddles off explanations so rapidly that audiences can hardly pick up on all of what he is saying, or all of the nuanced humor during the interplay between Watson and him. Unfortunately much of the laugh-out-loud humor as been divulged in the trailer, but a film should not be penalized for the faults of its advertising campaign. The musical score is supplemental to the frantic convolutions of the film's earlier scenes, providing a spirited tune that rides the energy of fiddling and poses as anything but generic. The locations are likewise smart, the costumes are admirable, and the effects are gritty, proving to be another benefit of having an indie Director helm an event film. Ultimately there are no blatant shortcuts in the way of computer generation, only clever sets and a brilliant Art Direction.-----'Sherlock Holmes' is refreshingly less conventional than one might guess, even if some viewers may find themselves a bit lost by Ritchie's unforgiving cuts and unrelenting energy. It jumps right into the tale, no origins told and no flashbacks necessary, relying on Holmes renowned history. Furthermore, many subtle elements of the various characters' past interactions are left for the audience to deduce in the fashion of Sherlock Holmes himself. And while the film may not be the grand epic some may have hoped for, its sheer entertainment value is undeniable. From the moment the credits roll it's apparent that 'Sherlock Holmes' cannot be full appreciated in one screening, and will likely grow in favor upon further viewings. It further presents itself as a gem of home entertainment in the long run, as a film that can be enjoyed on any occasion in any company, even with its hefty two-hour-plus runtime. This is a byproduct of the wonderfully gritty action Ritchie brings to the tale, and the uncompromising portrayal of the classic characters by the films superb leads. 'Sherlock Holmes' won't be quite what you expect, and you may even be dismayed by the films feisty narrative style, but more often than not you'll be completely entertained by the characters on screen in this fun addition to the loaded Holiday season.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Tremendous!!! One of my favorite movies of the year.,"What a ride. ""Sherlock Holmes"" left me giddy. I absolutely loved it.

"Entertaining, Sophisticated, Gritty - A New Breed of Sherlock Holmes","Opening on Christmas Day, Sherlock Holmes showed itself to be worthy as a blockbuster hit. To be frank, I came with an expectation that the movie would be terrible.

Watson his side kick who is his loyal friend is always there to save his dear partner from harm's way. Irene plays the notorious thief and lover of Mr. Holmes. She is a wily character who keeps the reader guessing her motives.The cinematography of the movie was special because it showed parts of the film as Holmes' future logical deductions. The movie also used the tradition method of explaining the Sherlock Holmes deductions after given the facts and clues.Sherlock Holmes' evil nemesis play his part well. There were many humorous antics and displays of ingenious traps. The other minor characters also added to the crude humor and laughter.Overall, this movie deserves to be watched.

"Downey Jr. helps ""Holmes"" entertain in a livelier, more modern way","The grandfather of the mystery genre -- and film's most adapted character -- is none other than the great detective Sherlock Holmes, so if one were to apply Holmes' own deductive reasoning skills, a modern reinvention was a matter of time. English Director Guy Ritchie (""Snatch,"" ""RocknRolla"") applies his witty and gritty crime thriller style to the first mainstream 21st Century version of Holmes, one that will likely appeal to a younger crowd and those less familiar with previous incarnations of the iconic sleuth.The reason is the new ""Holmes"" is much less concerned with the quality of the mystery and more focused on breathing a new quirkiness and style into the character and his top-notch detective work. The script hopes you'll be hooked on the reveal of how Holmes figures everything out and not so much the crime/mystery itself. In other words our new ""Holmes"" is about creating an entertaining diversion in the form of clever logic, high-brow humor and old-school science -- it uses mystery conventions but to a showier end. Wisely, Warner Bros. has trusted the responsibility of delivering this amusement to one of the best and hottest comedians out there in Robert Downey Jr.Downey Jr. continues to impress in his turn as Holmes, managing to employ his same wit and charms while creating a unique character that makes you feel as if you're watching Holmes, not RDJ with yet another accent. This Holmes is not merely a wise detective of old, but the quirky type, suggesting some insanity behind the genius. RDJ makes him much more colorful and entertaining and takes attention away from an okay storyline.The mystery surrounds Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong), who appears to have supernatural abilities derived from an ancient magic. He creates terror in London appearing to have risen from the grave and committed a couple murders. Holmes and his dear friend Dr. Watson (Jude Law) are on the verge of ending their partnership because Watson has plans to settle down and marry when the crafty Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) gets them deep into the Blackwood case.The supernatural angle didn't work well for the latest Indiana Jones film and it doesn't exactly do well here. ""Sherlock Holmes"" Ver. 2009 is a little more Dan Brown ""Angels & Demons"" and a little less ""Se7en."" This is fine for those who can look to Holmes for a more mainstream romp than what an older crowd might hope to be a rigorous exercise in fine mystery and logic. Again, the fewer the expectations, the better.As for the lean and mean Guy Ritchie depiction of Holmes, it's not entirely unfounded. The script creatively draws the connection between Holmes' intellectual prowess and how he might use it in a physical bout. It adds another dimension and ups the entertainment factor of the character. It might feel like it's giving a character steroids to put on more of a show, but the appeal would be too narrow if Holmes were straight-laced. Credit, however, has to go to Downey Jr. for making this vision work. His banter with Watson and ability to use classic Holmes logic to a comic effect is infinitely enjoyable.It does take a bit of settling in to understand exactly what direction this new Holmes is going in, but it works thanks to RDJ and picks up as the mystery thickens and Holmes' limits are tested. McAdams' character lacks enough strength to stay memorable and as much as I like Strong, his character lacks dimension too. But the rebirth of Holmes will be a nice Holiday escape for the modern audience and those willing to keep an open mind.

Refreshing to a fresh eye...,"As you can tell from the first review, you probably have to be a big reader or fanboy/girl of Sherlock Holmes in order to be displeased. I was pleased almost the whole way through this movie without caring much about character. Still, even though Sherlock Holmes sometimes was a bit too 'ambiguously gay' and had an annoying modern-like personality, he continued to be funny, strange, and as intelligent as I thought Sherlock should be. Jude Law did a good job as well as others on the cast.I loved the plot. It was obvious to me at times how the story would unravel, but then it hits you again in the end. It was a subtle hit, however. Anyways, my favorite part of the story was mainly the broad scheme of things and the people involved. Sherlock goes deep enough into the world of conspiracy to keep me interested.My only gripe with this movie is sometimes the humor. A lot of the 'humor' came out during conversations. People would laugh at the wittiness spewed by the main characters, and it just felt too much like a modern sitcom. Today, American society and culture is infected with internet memes, battles of quick wit, and straight-faced jokes that provoke a lame laughter from me (one not deeply felt.) You could compare what I am saying to the dialogue in 'The Big Bang Theory.' Hollywood could maybe tone down a bit on dry and clever jokes, especially when they poke out during unnecessary times.In conclusion, I enjoyed this movie enough to rate it an 8 out of 10, and although I did complain more than I gave praise, I just didn't want to give away all of the good parts. Go see this movie. It's fresh, isn't based in America, and doesn't trail off there either. There are twists, excellent action scenes, lots of fun moments, sweet investigation, and some analogous material better discussed in a forum of theorists.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Guy Ritchie  & Robert Downey Jr. reimagines Sherlock Holmes,"Robert Downey Jr. is the legendary Sherlock Holmes. He plays the character as a superior-minded, physical, arrogant for good reasons, and manic. Dr. John Watson (Jude Law) is his loyal assistant who tries to deal with Holmes' eccentricities. They catch serial killer occultist Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) and put him away in prison. The mysterious grifter Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) is Holmes' equal, and comes to him with a murky proposition. When Blackwood seemingly returns from the dead after his hanging, Holmes must pick up the chase once again.This is a more action oriented Sherlock Holmes in director Guy Ritchie's hands. He is not the cool calculating academic sleuth that is traditional in the character. The three leads have great chemistry together. RDJ creates an unique Holmes. Ritchie has piled on a densely written story of quirky mannerism, and outrageous action. It can be confusing at times like most other Ritchie movie. But confusions aside, this is a fun manic movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Fantastic re-imagination of Holmes and Watson,"I cannot find out why people rate this so low. They must have not read any of the original stories. Holmes was indeed a childish man. Brilliant, but has a childish side. And he knows how to fight, as he does in a few stories. People need to read ALL of the books, and then make their assessment. Otherwise, they're just slandering a fantastic movie they know nothing about.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Guy Ritchie does his best to screw it up,"The first film of Guy Ritchie's that I've seen since his staggeringly awful debut, Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (aka No Way! Shut Up! I've Never Even Seen Reservoir Dogs!). I was right to avoid him. Sherlock Holmes is almost a good movie. In any case, Robert Downey Jr. is an inspired choice for the role, and he really does his best to make the film work. I don't at all object to the idea of making Sherlock Holmes an action hero. The screenwriters make it make at least some sense. But, boy, does Ritchie go out of his way to screw everything up. The guy can't direct an action sequence to save his life. At one moment, he's overexplaining everything via slow-mo flashbacks (we could figure out Rachel McAdams drugged the wine, we don't need to see it), and another moment he's confusing us with slapdash editing. The film is just a mess. In the hands of a better director, this franchise could have been worth watching, but in Ritchie's hands, I'll avoid any subsequent films.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
This movie's entertainment level is elementary.,"Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law play London detectives Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson, who captures the black magic follower Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong), but has somehow mysteriously returned to life after his hanging. Holmes is called on the case again as Blackwood is seeking exact revenge on him and the rest of London. Sherlock is also visited by former lover Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams), who has a secret agenda of her own.This movie has some intense and thrilling action scenes, particular those involving Sherlock and Blackwood. However, the overall pace of the plot is slow and tends to drag the story and the supposed humor did not deliver. The acting was OK for the most part, but the chemistry between the character leads suffers a little, which didn't provide much development and charm. The music score, though, was pretty catchy, and the sceneries of Old England are very nice.Overall, it's an average movie.Grade C",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Sherlock Holmes - Kung Fu Fighter,"About three minutes in, I had to run out in the Lobby to check what movie I was seeing. I thought I had purchased ticket for a Sherlock Holmes movie. You know. Sherlock Holmes - the genius detective who used his superior brain power to outwit villains of every stripe? But what I was seeing was Sam Spade. Somehow he got transported back to 19th century London and was persuading the bad guys with an astonishing array of knuckle sandwiches, knives and pistols. And the movie just continued in this vein - with Holmes punching it out with assorted thugs, including, I kid you not, Irish toughs who gather in cattle pens at the stockyard and stage fights for a purse. Who was this Holmes impersonator I wondered? I immediately riffled though my A Conan Doyle Complete Serlock Holmes books, and, much to my surprise, was able to find at least two episodes where Holmes talks about using the martial arts to subdue nefarious foes. He is also portrayed in the books as an expert swordsman. However, scenes with Holmes actually deploying fisticuffs apparently don't occur in the books at all.So the movie producers and writers have modernized the current Holmes to make him more appealing to the ""cage fighter"" generation. I guess I can forgive them for that. It did make the movie more exciting than the ""snail's-pace"" action we got in all of the Basil Rathbone oeuvres from the thirties. In those, Holmes relied almost exclusively on his wits. However this movie used the violence as a plot vehicle too much in my opinion. I do miss Basil, even though his stereotyped version of Holmes also doesn't appear in the books. No deerstalker hat for example. It's not in the book. This movie also captures the tortured, opium-addicted, nature of Holmes quite well. That is mostly missing from the Rathbone movies.Okay, overall this was a good movie, albeit a bit too rough, too little polish, too much bare-knuckles for my tastes. Go see it though. Holmes with wit - and grit to spare.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

Sherlock Holmes Becomes Batman,"I took my three kids to see this movie and we had a good time. But as their dad I can read their true reactions; i.e., ""good"" has several meanings, degrees, shades, etc., and I don't believe they thought it was anything special, extraordinary, etc.My problem was it just was not a Sherlock Holmes film, what with the extraordinary action scenes, the mild humor, and, especially, the diabolical plot line of taking over the world. Not to mention Holmes never had anything approaching a romantic interest.I understand the argument that the film introduced Sherlock Holmes to a new audience and needed some ""jazzing up"" to compete with other films. But for those of us who grew up with Basil Rathbone playing Holmes, the subtlety, nuance, and suspense was entirely missing.Next up, Vigil Mortessen plays Tarzan as Spiderman.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Sherlock Holmes...More Brawn Than Brain,"That Oxymoron can't be helped. With the popularity and Box-Office ringing that Comic-Book Movies (yes, Sherlock Holmes is a ""Super-Hero"", think Batman) it always brings up that tired but necessary Debate about the Reboot.It is a decision that has to be made behind the Scenes at the Script and Conference level. The approach. It can be an intellectual decision having to do with a ""fresh"", new, look, or a re-energizing. But most often it is purely Commercial. The Number Crunchers are as important as the Writer and Director. Will it sell, and how well?There's nothing wrong with a Profit. It makes everyone happy and finances Sequels and such. So the Purists be damned, shut up, see this thing made Godzillians. Of course they have to include enough elements of the Original Character to be at least recognizable.After all, you can't garner interest in a Movie called Sherlock Holmes and have the ""Worlds most famous consulting Detective"" and have it take place on Zeta Reticuli. Although that could very well happen with Today's Self-Importance, so obvious in Filmmakers like Guy Ritchie and M. Knight Shyamalan, and Clint Eastwood, among others.So here it is and we're stuck with it.

"Good movie, but this is not Sherlock.","In the Fawlty Towers episode: Waldorf Salad, Basil Fawlty was confronted by the guest who complained that he did not get the dish he ordered: The Waldorf Salad. Basil tried to convince the guest that the salad was indeed the Waldorf Salad, pulling his usual stunts and tricks, but to no avail: the guest was adamant that the salad at hand was not the one he ordered. The guest, guessing correctly, that Basil had no clue what was the Waldorf Salad, even told him the list of ingredients of the salad, and he also stated clearly that a cook cannot omit some ingredients or substitute them with some others and call it Waldorf Salad. Finally Basil's wife, Sybil, came to the rescue by making the salad with right ingredients, to the satisfaction of the guest.Unfortunately, there is no Sybil to rescue us here: the dish has bin made, it was packaged and delivered, we can either take it or leave it. I took it. I am not sure what kind of salad it was, but the taste was not too bad. However, in the end, it made me feel like the another character, this one from one of Bugs Bunny cartoons: The guy ordered rabbit stew, and Bugs, playing the waiter, brought him the carrot instead.

A Nutshell Review: Sherlock Holmes,"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle had arguably created the literary world's greatest detective operating from that famed 221B Baker Street address in London, and has been the subject of countless film interpretations, but none quite like what Guy Ritchie had crafted in making Sherlock Holmes a lot more sexier for today's audiences, compared to the rather stiff persona perceived so far, picking up the various clues from the books and cranking those elements up by a mile. It's hard to find someone who's never heard of Holmes' superb powers of observation and deduction, being that consulting detective for the police, but never one comfortable with the limelight.Ritchie had sexed up the characters of Holmes (Robert Downey Jr) and his trusty assistant Dr John Watson (Jude Law) so much, that you can't deny the homoerotic vibes that reverberate all around when these two gentlemen grace the screen in the same scene, obviously still trying to work out emotional issues with their brotherly bonds now threatened with Watson's engagement to Mary Morstan (Kelly Reilly), and his moving out of their operating apartment. There's this perpetual reluctance in allowing Watson to leave, and the jibes that they share is unquestionably very much like a bickering, seasoned couple, toward the end of a close partnership which had yielded tremendous success.Which became the opening scene of the film, where we see the dynamic duo working hand in hand to crack and solve a case of demonic rituals as conducted by Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong), a villain who is pronounced dead by hanging, but turning up very much alive and walking the streets of London to exact his sinister plot based on Fear. Black magic, superstition and secret orders become the themes that Holmes and Watson, through science, have to solve before a New World Order gets underway in Old Victorian England, in an era just on the cusp of massive industrial revolution, having the landscape very much the highlight as well thanks to wonderful CG work that chugs along nicely in the background.As a film for both fans of the Sherlock Holmes character and as an introduction, this film did its obligatory scenes well to bring you up to speed with the character and his idiosyncrasies, be it little tidbits like Holmes' erratic eating habits, the ordered chaos of 221B Baker Street, his roguish methods at times, the myriad of disguises employed and of course, Watson being the biographer of their joint exploits. Some of these elements get the in-your-face treatment, while others get quietly snuck into the narrative that will certainly delight fans who spot them.And Guy Ritchie stamps his usual trademarks with the flash forwards and backwards to highlight some of these prowesses, from his monologues on the deductions formed, to that of spicing up the limited hand-to-hand combat to show off Holmes' natural advantage when having to rely on brute force thanks to physics and anatomical knowledge, not to mention coming with a touch of arrogance in determining how long his opponent will be out of action. Ritchie would seem to be at home with his filmography boasting a vast array of character thugs, now having his same storytelling technique applied to the other side of the law.Some may think that Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law share no chemistry, but I disagree. Their scenes together as Holmes and Watson couldn't be any better, and I would be hard pressed to think of another buddy pairing, which would bring out the same spirit as buddy- cop pairings from the past, such as that from the Lethal Weapon series with Gibson-Glover. Both men bring about a cavalier attitude to their respective roles, and seemed to be having a heck of a good time when paired up together, utilizing each of their specific skill sets brought to the table, especially when called upon to use their fists once in a while over their cerebral abilities. A major action sequence here also had this unbelievable fight which spilled from a lab to the docks, complete with sinking ship and flying anchors thanks yet again to the non-intrusive CG work.The wildcard of the film proved to be Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler, the only woman who could catch Holmes' offguard, and well, the one who perennially escapes. Her role here is probably nothing more than to contribute to the setting up of the next film (if it materializes, though I don't see why not), with the shadow of Holmes' greatest nemesis Professor Moriaty constantly hovering, and which the filmmakers did quite brilliantly to keep him under wraps from the credits even, so that casting calls for a follow up movie would likely go into this frenzy when deciding who should step into those shoes to rival Holmes.Only time would tell whether that follow up film would be made, but for now, do enjoy this jazzed up tale of Sherlock Holmes and Dr John Watson, in an adventure that would keep you at the edge of your seat. Highly recommended!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Seems to be based on non-Sherlock Holmes material,"Where to start? My main problem with the film was there being NO Sherlock Holmes or Watson characters, and NO mystery plot. Seemed more like some strange action/fantasy hybrid.I have a feeling we'll find out where there going with this in the sequel. Perhaps Jude Law is actually playing Sherlock Holmes? I think Robert Downey may be covering for him, as Jude seemed to be the one more likely to be the Sherlock type.Other than the lack of plot and characters, I had a major problem with the ridiculous action scenes. I guess I should have been ready for them from seeing the trailers/commercials but there's more ridiculous action than I could tolerate. Especially for a film labeled as a Sherlock Holmes film.1/10.

Scientist crime fighter dispels superstitious nonsense on Christmas,"How fitting for an intelligent hero to emerge in theaters on Christmas to dispel silly superstition. Guy Ritchie did a great job portraying this master detective based on the actual Doyle stories and did not rely on the old Holmes movies. In other words, this movie was a good adaptation, not a remake ten times over. He made Holmes more than an armchair detective and focused on the crime fighter that Doyle intended.I especially enjoyed the visuals, including London with its filthy unpaved roads and the flat at 221B as it probably should look with two bachelors living there, especially with one with an intensely curious mind.I liked how the movie focused on Sherlock's ability to fit in with criminals as well as his ability to fight—both of which are hinted at many times in the fifty plus stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.I like too how Ritchie dispensed with the curved pipe and deerstalker hat, neither of which really is mentioned much in the stories. The violin was a big part of Holmes' stories, and I like how he strummed the instrument in the movie while thinking about his cases. Something a thinking person would do.Finally, this was cast in an interesting way. The actor who played Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong), and even Jude Law, have physical features more identifiable with Holmes and they may have thought they were going to play the role when hired for the film. Instead, Ritchie cast an unlikely actor, American Robert Downey, Jr. This worked because Downey comes across as a mind that it always busy. Downey might also relate to Holmes' drug addiction, which was not shown in this movie but is hinted at (sloppy apartment, disheveled appearance, experiment of drugs on dog, bored when not working, etc.)The music in the movie was up-tempo and musical, suggesting a busy mind. The plot was a little bland and a lot like the plot of The DaVinci Code, but the feel was right for Holmes. One of my favorite aspects of the Holmes' stories was that there was always a mystical element thrown in. Doyle was a spiritualist and brought a certain otherworldly darkness to the mysteries, until Sherlock's keen brilliance illuminated all the swindles and schemes, just as he did in this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Sherlock Holmes Has A Lot of Bad Complimented By A Lot of Good,"The Bad1. The villain - I truly thought that Lord Blackwood was a terrible villain. There was nothing about him that really intrigued me. Sure, he is a ""sorcerer."" Sweet (no idea that Lord Voldemort invaded the Sherlock Holmes universe before going after Harry Potter). There are a few good twists revolving around Blackwood. But in a Sherlock Holmes movie, I would have preferred to see an antagonist more along the lines of Jack the Ripper as the source of Holmes' cases. Mark Strong turns in a convincing but forgettable performance as Blackwood. His character is not very well developed and does not get a large amount of screen time. In better scripts, such as The Dark Knight with the Joker or Silence of the Lambs with Hannibal Lector, it is effective to use the villain sparingly. In SH, on the other hand, I often nearly forgot all about Holmes' nemesis. I realize that the writers were going for some originality with using a supernaturally driven villain. I will admit that I haven't read the books and my Holmes knowledge only goes as far as legend and Wikipedia. However, Lord Blackwood seemed all wrong for this movie.2. Rachel McAdams (Irene Adler) - She is gorgeous. Her looks alone will be enough to encourage any man to buy a ticket. Her performance and character, on the other had, were nothing to write home about. Adler's part in the movie is fairly ambiguous. The script finally informs the audience of her motives at the end in some short dialogue, but by that point I did not even care anymore. Rachel McAdams' Irene Adler was so stale and poorly written that I ignored her presence in most scenes. I will say that this is more the issue of the script than McAdams. She seemed to be trying her best to bring the character to life and she flaunts her beauty to keep to audience focused. Sorry, Rachel. Irene Adler is too awful of a character for even your face to win over fans.3. The Script - LONG. And it is only a two hour movie. That should give you an idea of the surplus of blandness in the script. If I were to give Guy Ritchie some advice for the director's cut, I would probably tell him to cut out thirty-five minutes of the movie. Adding additionally footage to SH would put even the most caffeinated person to sleep. There are some great elements to the script with the witty dialogue. Having said that, the story is at times incomprehensible and quite frankly boring. After the first fairly entertaining hour of the movie, prepare for forty minutes of draaaaaaaag. Sherlock's solutions came a little too late to save this screenplay.The Good:1. Downey Jr. and Jude Law - Please, everyone, stop saying that these two are miscast. Both actors (given what they had to work with) were excellent. Robert Downey Jr. sports a good enough British accent while convincingly portraying the genius, sarcastic persona of Sherlock Holmes. I would say that Holmes' monologues of explaining the gray areas in the case are some of the best parts of the film. RDJ does a great job of convincing audiences that Holmes can be a martial arts expert while at the same time possessing a strong aptitude for sleuthing (I don't know if this film's depiction of Holmes is accurate for the original Sherlock, but this mediocre script called for it and RDJ delivered in what could have been a highly laughable character). Jude Law's Watson is refreshing in that he is actually very helpful to Holmes. Unfortunately, his character disappears in the last thirty minutes of the movie (he comes back for the final scene). However, Law has enough screen time to please audiences with his performance. As has been said many times before on this thread, the chemistry between RDJ and Law is wonderful and is easily the highlight of the film. They play off each other very well and it seems like the two of them had been friends for years (which is overly impressive in that the two actors had never met before the commencement of filming SH). Oh, and also, they are not gay. I don't know why people started that rumor but I really did not get that impression from the film. They are partners in crime solving, but definitely not partners in life.2. The set direction/costuming - London looks absolutely incredible in this film. It seems like the movie was going for maybe a more visual experience than a true Sherlock Holmes experience. The sets and costumes of Victorian London are Oscar Worthy and should be recognized come award season.3. Guy Ritchie - Well, it wasn't a great film. But it wasn't as bad as some of the stinkers he has put out since Snatch. I would say that with the big budget success that this film is destined for, Guy Ritchie could be on a path to better films. I'm sorry for those of you who enjoyed Swept Away and Revolver, but I am going to go out on a limb and say that Ritchie has been in a bit of a slump. His handle on RDJ, Law and the overall setting of the movie showed me that he might be coming back into his Lock, Stock and Snatch form.So there are a few of my thoughts. It is at times a fun film with quick dialogue and intriguing action sequences. But at the end, I did not care about 90 percent of the characters, Sherlock may have thrown one too many Judo Chops and Lord Blackwood probably should have just stayed dead in the grave. It would have at least given a better villain a chance to challenge the always entertaining Holmes and Watson duo.Grade: B- (or just below 7/10 stars)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Holmes without mystery,"Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr) and his trusted swashbuckling limp-legged sidekick Dr Watson (Jude Law) are two peas of a criminological pod-unit in the XIX Century. Lightyears ahead in knowledge of the London bobbies (not to mention the outdated methods of CSI) they are an unstoppable detective force, that breaks down any mystery within a matter of minutes. They are essentially Batman and Robin of the XIX Century... just without the masks.One of their cases forces them to solve a mysterious series of murders committed on young women. The culprit is Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong), a member of a hidden sect and an learned adept of the black arts. Sherlock Holmes manages to foil Lord Blackwood just before he attempts to sacrifice another girl on his black altar of power. This sees Blackwood thrown into prison and prepping up for the noose.After ending this supposedly last big mission Sherlock Holmes locks himself away frustrated with his awesomeness and the boredom on the outside (he simplicity of cases to be offered is very frustrating). Hence he indulges into wacky experiments on animals (poor pouch), gets wasted regularly and throws himself into illegal back-alley brawls to waste the time. In the meantime Dr Watson finds himself a beautiful woman with whom he aims to spend the rest of his life with, thus creating a new sphere of everyday existence that no longer entails Holmes or solving crimes. Meanwhile Lord Blackwood is to be hanged...This is a movie I really wanted to like, but in the end I found it very wanting in most areas. Robert Downey Jr and surprisingly Jude Law both do a fine job in the respective parts and since they are key to the story you deftly find yourself asking why the movie constantly falls short of its promise.For one thing Sherlock Holmes has been transformed from a great detective into a supernatural superhero. The crimes are basically unsolvable with pure logic and only due to Holmes having superhuman cognizance and total awareness is he able to solve them. This leaves viewers to being basically receptacles of Holmes brilliance, but in no way are we capable of actually trying to solve the puzzle. We just quietly have to accept the solution presented on a silver platter. All in all this leads the movie about Sherlock Holmes focused on action, because it is devoid of any real mystery. In the end you just wait until Sherlock Holmes explains the plot point. No inner voice says 'Oh yeah! That's was so obvious!' or 'Wow! I never thought of that!'. After Holmes explains the non-mystery in this detective story its back to the no hold barred action.Secondly and surprisingly Guy Ritchie really fell short in the one place he used to excel in - the comedy department. Despite having such an excellent comedic actor in Robert Downey Jr all the jokes in this movie fall well short. Some of the gags are really quite brilliant, but even those don't even get a smirk out of you. The scenes are too rushed and have no real comedic feeling. Instead of building the joke and then letting it burst at the right moment all the jokes are basically leaking out of a punctured balloon. Adding to that most jokes are extremely clichéd and have a 'done that' feel to them. Its almost like rewatching ""Maverick"".Thirdly the movie has a comic-book feel to it, but not in the Christopher Nolan manner (good), but more in the direction of Batman and Robin. This movie really needs less punchlines and more dark dramatic scenes that bring a bit of seriousness to the movie.There are some very strong points to the movie. One of these is the beautiful presentation of old London, which really is jaw-dropping and the best such achievement of presenting a XIX century town in cinema history. I was also very impressed by three scenes, which really showed how talented a storyteller Guy Ritchie can be. One of these concerned Sherlock Holmes thinking out step by step what he would do to his opponent in a boxing match and then doing it in real time. The second was a sequence of blasts which really were very intense and gave the movie a dramatic punch. The third was a retrospective in which we find out what Sherlock Holmes did just minutes earlier. All three scenes are brilliantly shot and really added two stars to my general vote for this movie. Another 2 stars I give due to the fine duo performance by Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law. Unfortunately the director was not up to par to the acting.Just to end on a positive note: The movie definitely deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Cinematography.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Physical and Manic,"Dr. John Watson: Holmes, does your depravity know no bounds? Sherlock Holmes: No.The Da Vinci Code meets The Wild, Wild West by way of Jackie Chan and The Fight Club—Robert Downey, Jr. captures the manic, addictive nature of Sherlock Holmes without the sober intellectuality of Basil Rathbone, the Holmes against which all others are measured. Director Guy Ritchie sets a feverish pace for the Victorian detective story, allowing Downey to overindulge his acting tics and considerable athletic ability to create a modern emblem of the deductive thinker, imitating the more physical evidencing of CSI rather than the traditionally contemplative crime fighter of Conan Doyle's Holmes.The intellectual side seems to come from the 20th-century attitude indulging of Holmes and Dr. Watson (Jude Law), himself an accomplished fighter and worrier. Their banter even when they are fighting a French giant (imagine that! shades of James Bond) is more Butch Cassidy than Sherlock Holmes.As in the Da Vinci Code, the villain is associated with a secret powerful organization, like the Masons, that plans a serious overthrow of government and world domination. Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) is the pre-Moriarity evil brain, who seemingly has come back from the dead to further his nefarious plot.Holmes, like Dan Brown's Robert Langdon, is the brains outside the police solving Blackwood's crimes because Inspector Lestrade and his cops are clueless. Not that we don't get the usual Holmesian lectures about the simple clues we and Lestrade missed; it's just that Downey delivers them rapid fire as if he couldn't wait to get to the next athletic activity. Rathbone could deliver them like sipping a fine wine.The strength of the film is in the physicality, from meticulously designed London settings to incessant and overly long fisticuffs. The bare knuckling allows Downey to be shirtless, a plus for older folks who thought such a physique the province of men half his age.The presence of gifted criminal Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) is a welcome touch as she sparks the kind of analysis Holmes needs most—of himself. Ritchie has picked this little part of the Holmes legend wisely but fails to expand it in a classic opportunity lost to the relentless action.This Sherlock Holmes is a 20th century quick-cut sleuth in 19th century waistcoat. I have plenty of memories of that hyperactive 20th; I just wanted to smoke a pipe in the 19th with a reserved Holmes and listen to the deductions of his exploits.I'll wait for the Rathbone reruns.Dr. John Watson: (to Holmes drinking a liquid) ""You do know what you are drinking is meant for eye surgery?""",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Sherlock Holmes An Entertaining Action Crime Adventure,"Sherlock Holmes is an entertaining action crime adventure from director Guy Ritchie whose admirable in making this movie. It has actually made me what to check out some of his other films like Snatch and Rock N Rolla to name a few. Sherlock Holmes has some tiny flaws that I'll get into later but the good more than outweighs the bad in this one. Robert Downey Jr. is fantastic as the character of the title. It's definitely a much different interpretation of the popular private sleuth detective than we've seen before. With Iron Man, Zodiac, The Soloist, and Tropic Thunder, Downey Jr. has made a great comeback proving to be one of Hollywoods most talented actors. He continues to solidify just that with his performance in this movie. Well done. Jude Law is equally impressive as Holmes partner and best friend Dr. John Watson. Downey Jr. and Law have genuine chemistry with each other perfecting an odd couple relationship between their characters. They make the best of the screen time together which provides the movie with a lot of humor. Rachel McAdams is good as Irene Adler the only woman to make as Watson puts it ""a proper idiot"" out of Holmes ""twice."" Despite not being given a whole lot do, McAdams is convincing as the beautiful temptress Irene none the less. Mark Strong is solid as serial killer and mysterious occult ""sorcerer"" Lord Blackwood in his limited screen time who proves to be an effective villain for Holmes. He doesn't share many scenes with Downey Jr. but the few they do have together are well written. The rest of the cast are nothing memorable but they do what their roles require and still turn in decent performances. The action sequences are well executed with just enough so it doesn't feel like overkill. There was a nice balance between the action, humor, and drama that made the 128 minute running time go by at a steady pace. The humor was very funny which always helps make a film better and we can thank most of it from the banter between Downey Jr. and Law. They both delivered their lines to perfection bringing much of the humor out of the script through their odd couple relationship. There were a few memorable quotes too that I found quite funny like ""Permission to enter the armory?"", ""No girl wants to marry a doctor who can't tell if a man's dead or not"", and ""So that's a no to the opera then?"" to name a couple. Some of the action scenes were even humorous especially the one with Sherlock Holmes in a bare knuckles boxing match and another involving a huge French guy. I also liked how most of the films mysteries including Lord Blackwood's possible supernatural abilities were explained in a logical manner and it didn't leave you with many unanswered questions. The few minor flaws were that certain characters (Blackwood and Irene) weren't really developed considering most of the focus is on Downey and Law which isn't a bad thing. It just wouldn't be a little better if we knew more about Blackwood or Irene. The climatic fight between Holmes and Blackwood near the climax felt a bit rushed but hey that's okay because everything else made up for the films minor flaws. Overall I was still very impressed with Sherlock Holmes and I recommend this to anyone looking for a movie that sure to leave you feeling entertained by the end. Sherlock Holmes has a complex but not too complicated story with just enough action, humor, drama, and exceptional performances by the two leads (especially Downey Jr. and Law) who make this film worth the time to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Forget the Past!,"Books should not be compared to movies. Movie versions should not be compared to each other. If you are a true artist, you always put your stamp on your production. The stories of Arthur Conan Doyle are masterpieces and they have had their time. If one is willing to come up with a new angle using the characters as perceived by the public, more power to him. There have been hundreds of pastiches done with the Holmes canon. Anyway, the film before us uses a preposterous plot that has angered the purists. It's probably some of the same people who died a little each day after Lord of the Rings and Spiderman came out. This film is a joyful mess in the tradition of Indian Jones. The two principles, Holmes and Watson grow on us and take us on a merry ride through London into some pretty weird stuff. It doesn't matter what has been done before, just enjoy the ride and look to the future. But don't forget the wonderful efforts of Basil Rathbone and Jeremy Brett. They can, indeed, coexist.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Has ""Busted Franchise"" Written All Over It","As a long time Sherlock Holmes fan,I really wanted to say something good about this one, but I really can't. Guy {Madonna's ex} Ritchie modern take on the classic Conan-Doyle stories seems to have been made for a contemporary audience who has no clue {get it?}-on who Holmes is. Downey totally fails as Holmes in a character who is too modern-and possibly too ambigiously gay for the role-not that there's anything wrong with that. He is all nervous tics and always seems to have something else on his mind. Hell, he doesn't even wear the famous deerstalker hat!Law is just alright as Watson and he does try to bring some comic relief to the character. The story has Holmes trying to stop a plot to destroy London. There are the usual CGI scenes, but for some reason most of them are pretty well done and do manage to capture the essence of what London probably looked like at that time. Also there is a very good Irish bar song that is featured throughout the movie. Even though it is a good looking and well produced movie, it is somewhat hard to follow at times and fairly predictable from start to finish., even though some interesting diversions with some steampunk items placed in try to add some momentum to the story line. Obviously looking for a new franchise, the producers of this should hope that the Baker St.boys are a hit at the box office. Movie itself is fairly likable, but it just falls flat on what it has to deliver. That's the trouble with Holmes when new stories are written to cater to contemporary tastes. Prehaps if an original Conan-Doyle story was used, this would have turned out better. Where are Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce when you need them?",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
The cool new Sherlock Holmes,"I am a big fan of the Sherlock Holmes stories, having spent a good part of my teenage and college days reading Doyle's books multiple times over. I have also tremendously enjoyed the Guy Ritchie films that I have watched so far - Lock, Stock and two smoking barrels, and Snatch. So, needless to say, I had huge expectations from the Guy Ritchie adaptation of Sherlock Holmes. And this movie did not disappoint me, though I did not adore the movie as much as I thought I would.Guy Ritchie has given Sherlock Holmes a cool new makeover and transforms him into an adventure loving action hero (though Doyle gives an impression in the books that Holmes was more a man of languor than a man of action), while keeping his methodical logic and meticulous attention to detail, intact. In fact, there is a lot of focus throughout the film on these well known and other little known Holmes traits, and other quirks that are trademarks of the Baker street detective. But what is most striking is the beautiful interpretation of the Holmes - Watson relationship. Since the books are narrated from Watson's perspective, the neutral perspective of the film throws new light on Holmes's emotional dependence on Watson and his possessive love for his loyal sidekick. Jude Law plays his part to delightful perfection and is often more charming than Downey Jr. Downey Jr. though good, is still more Downey Jr. than Sherlock Holmes, but the two actors share a great on-screen chemistry.Ritchie continues to delight with his fast paced staccato style narration of a complicated plot, though the execution here is not as perfect as in Lock, Stock... and Snatch, and there were phases in the movie which felt abrupt and left me a little confused. In keeping with the style of the books, the storyline remains vague for the major part until Holmes offers his traditional logical explanation of the case in the end. The makers, however, seem to have tried to emulate the success of the Batman franchise, rejuvenated by Nolan, and at times, I did feel like I was watching Sherlock Holmes in ""The Prestige"".The cinematography is brilliant as with the other Ritchie films, and so is the background score.Overall, a good film. Would I watch it again? Yes. And a sequel? Definitely, yes. I am looking forward to Guy Ritchie making a better Holmes film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Great fun, solid acting but not a good film","This is a movie where solid acting, great art direction (costumes, buildings and decoration) and some funny comedy lines happen. There are even some sessions that feel a little bit yaoi-oriented (refer to Wikipedia), which might please Asian fans, especially girls, while for teenager boys and early twenties like me, it doesn't seem that strange due to the way we express our friendship being similar to that shown in this film. On the whole, the performance isn't contrived at all, even when NOT considering the fact that it's a comedy. The old London city looks awfully beautiful with many details that accurately captures and represents the feeling of the streets.But on the other hand, the plot isn't great. You probably won't even take it as ""good"" if you like reasoning or logic that's supposed to be essential for detective fictions, you'd probably be disappointed. The reasons lie in two aspects. First, the reasoning portrayed in this movie relies way too much on professional knowledges; almost all the reasonings are built upon the knowledges of chemistry. Second, you don't get as many evidences and clues as Sherlock Holmes does; since the stuff he sees, or more literally, smells, are generally chemistry stuff, you won't know what he sees or smells or tastes until the end of the film. That said, you are totally impossible to solve the puzzle by yourself.So whether it's a film for you depends on your taste. If you're looking for some entertaining dialogs, good acting and beautiful scenes, you won't be let down. What's also worth mentioning is that the hand-to-hand combat in the film looks pretty decent too, but surely not as stunning as that in Bourne films or Matrix series.7.2/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Sherlock is Dead,"Fast-paced, stylish, great sets, good action, and enough brain teasing to cater to the not yet dead-in-the-head, but is it Sherlock? I guess it is now...It says in the trivia notes that Downey Jr studied Granada Television's Jeremy Brett's characterization of the great sleuth. I'm glad he didn't study him too closely because I much prefer Downey as Holmes. If the image of a lean, ascetic, high fore-headed, aquiline-nosed, drawn-cheeked, somewhat saturnine detective has to be banished, why not go all the way and replace him with someone Conan Doyle never had in mind in a million years but who is at least charming.I suppose it all comes down to casting and this was cast by current box- office appeal, with no regard to the fictional characters. The best or the most glaring example of this is Rachel McAdams who seems to have wandered off the set of a contemporary romantic comedy into London of the 1890s. Her presence in every scene is like having one of the period characters suddenly put a cellphone to his ear and take a suck at a Starbucks cup. The set design is fantastic: London of the time must've looked a lot like this, and although the clash exaggerates the time warp effect the sets win in the end, and with the excellent supporting cast make the movie credible, while Downey and Law do their best to make it in-credible - but that's what we're paying for after all.If you want the real Sherlock, and envision the character as Conan Doyle imagined him, read the books. If you want 2 hours of amusement go see this and you won't be disappointed.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"So, who else was hoping for Holmes and Watson to make out?","So, who else was hoping for Holmes and Watson to make out? That's the problem with making Watson sexy I guess, as opposed to being the rotund goofball he used to be.The movie was all I expected it to be, with Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law as leads and Guy Ritchie as director - there was plenty of wise- cracking and many cool action sequences. The story was fairly interesting too, though I have to say I didn't pay as much attention to it. But I liked that there was a big Reveal at the end where everything is explained. Very traditional mystery story.I think the only letdown was Rachel McAdams, whom I usually like and think is talented but fails to keep up with the two snappy leads here. I also wish she got to kick more ass, especially while wearing the bustly dresses. I don't think I've even seen any women do Jackie Chan chopsocky in bustly dresses.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
An enveloping movie (don't let the trailer turn you off),"With films such as this I feel stuck in the middle of targeted audiences; I love it when a series gets restarted but I'm always on my guard and at my most cynical.If you've ever had the hours of your life stolen from you with films like Wild wild west or The League of extraordinary gentlemen, then you know exactly what I mean when I say that it is rare indeed to see a movie set in the 1800's that isn't a load of historically inaccurate, technologically ridiculous, propriety insulting garbage.Sherlock Holmes (much to my great relief) has forgone that pitfall by a giant leap; the technology in the movie fits the time period very well- we are allowed the pleasure of seeing 'the future' of that time, but nothing absurd like a giant mechanical spider or a machine gun crossbow. The settings are wonderful. I'm not a British historian, but I know quality sets when I see them, and for once it's not Tim Burton that's responsible (meaning that they're good Gothic settings, but not unnecessarily bleak.)The fact that Robert Downey Jr. stars as Holmes made me even more on edge; he's just isn't who would come to mind at all. But the humor and intelligence he brings to the role is refreshing and wholly natural. We're not subjected to the unbearable smugness of your average super-protagonist, but rather an almost childishly humorous grown man, weary but curious of the world around him. Downey's English accent flows comfortably, so well in fact that I would risk getting a beat-down from his bodyguards to hug him for not putting me through another Nicholas Cage type accent abomination. I was never really in to Jude Law or Rachel McAdams but both of them also fell into their characters with winning performances, Law being the sidekick that keeps the hero in line without being annoyingly mean, and McAdams the love interest/femme fetale without being over the top, clingy or trashy.The story itself will wind your brain around a bit until the end, but isn't that why people have been in love with Sherlock Holmes for so many years in the first place? It will not bore you for a second, and it wraps up very nicely at the end (although you'll probably want to go over it your head again after you've left, which is a good thing)And last but not least, anyone who's ever read Sherlock Holmes will notice a plethora of accuracy, hints and homages, from Watson's limp thanks to the Jezail bullet that passed through his leg in the Afghan war, to the photo of Irene Adler that Holmes kept as a reminder of the only woman who ever outsmarted him.So take my advice and don't miss out on something this rare in concept; a quality revamp that pushes boundaries instead of ignoring them.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Entertaining,"OK, but not great. Not very faithful to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's books, and this detracts from the plot.

"Watch out Watson, that pitfall over there is littered with unfocusedness","Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes is a well-mannered and fairly acceptable revival to a mystery character as old as time itself. His name has been associated with sarcastic remarks, among other things, and it seems that between two Hollywood movies and the BBC program that the character has waltzed his way back into the mainstream eye. It always seemed to me that the character of Sherlock Holmes was more of a hipster phenomenon rather than a mainstream one. The film manages to keep the look and feel of an ""inside joke,"" but unfortunately, can't escape its oppressive Hollywood weight.Let's the start with the premise; It's 1891, and in the beginning, Holmes (Downey Jr.) and Watson (Law) chase down Lord Blackwood (Strong) so as to prevent a harsh ritual, wind up stopping him, and have him arrested, to learn three months later that he is dead. Watson looks forward to escaping the mundane town to marry his love Mary Morstan (Reilly) and leave Holmes to fend for himself. It isn't until Holmes is greeted by Rachel McAdams's Irene Adler, who tells him to search for a missing man named Luke Reordan, who is apparently the main puzzle piece to Blackwood's future plans.The first problem is the central storyline, which isn't very gripping or involving, rather than just acting as a storytelling device. A plot to have one if you will. It's tolerable, but at times, it seems singled out by Hans Zimmer's extravagant music and overshadowed by the chemistry of Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law. One could easily become more entranced with character relationships and bantered wit much more than the filler storyline.Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law make an impeccable duo, as brazen and as enjoyable as ever. Quite possibly the best actors to ever portray these characters. Downey is a superb actor for the roll, brash and unapologetic in his words and intellect, while Law portrays Watson as a more subtle figure in Holmes' cross-hairs. The comic possibilities of the screenplay are explored in a divine form, making way for a lot of button-pushing and world play to come into great effect. Their banter is undoubtedly the most fun thing in the film, and both characters have ignitable chemistry and presence on screen.As far as set designs work, Philippe Rousselot's ravishing cinematography, most of the time, works in the film's favor. Once in a while, it seems the backgrounds were more of the central concerns than the writing or tone, but it still comes off as fun and pleasant, without being too hard on the eyes or even heavy-handed and misguided.For me, Sherlock Holmes was a tad thin and vacuous. Ritchie's direction is great, the chemistry between the cast is welcomed and unforced, and the cinematography and music all of likable quality, but the film's storyline is a tad too unfocused and dry, and the redundancy of the look and feel for over two hours becomes a little hard to digest. I'm not entirely sure what fans will think of it. The mystery aspect seems a little flushed out in favor of other things, which I believe was one of the best things in the original series and shorts, and Hollywood has yet again taken a perfectly capable idea and manipulated it to the point where repetition and familiarity comes into play before anything in the film does.Starring: Robert Downey Jr., and Jude Law, Rachel McAdams, Mark Strong, and Kelly Reilly. Directed by: Guy Ritchie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
The Sign of the Bore,"I've finally figured out Guy Ritchie's fatal weakness as a filmmaker. He doesn't actually care about character, theme, or even storytelling. He just wants to be cool. He only wants characters that quirky, badasses, or sex godesses. Because they're cool. He employs flashy cutting, hyper-stylized cinematography, and fractured time lines. Because, they're cool!This worked for the bonkers Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, and Snatch. Those movies were cool and it felt natural, easy. Things took a turn for the ugly with Swept Away, this decade's Isthar. Revolver was dreadful, and RocknRolla dances in your faces practically screaming ""look how cool I am"" and is then forgotten before you've even unlocked the car to leave the theater.Which brings us to Ritchie's desperate-to-please, big-Hollywood style stab at Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's timeless icon. The production values are excellent. Period-appropriate London is completely convincing. Downey's Holmes captures the mad intensity of Doyle's character, withdrawn, depressed, and self destructive when he's has nothing to occupy is never ceasing ming, burning life and frantic energy when the case does arrive. He does however, straight up mumble for half the picture, rendering what might of been neat instances of observation/deduction/knowledge, but I couldn't tell. Couldn't understand him.Ah, the case. When it comes to adaptations, remakes, re-imaginings, etc, I'm a pretty forgiving fellow, as long as the soul is intact. Change the race, change the gender, change the setting, but don't lose the essence. The mystery, the case, is the soul of a Sherlock Holmes tale and I'm afraid this is where Ritchie's film falls flat. Sure, there's something dastardly afoot, but solving the puzzle is beyond the audience to predict. We're not made a part of the unraveling. Stuff goes on that we don't understand, and it's all explained in the end in smash cut flash backs, filling us in with details that were never foreshadowed, many of them feeling like afterthoughts to dig the screenplay out of the hole it dug for itself. Doyle's stories invite us to narrow our brows and read carefully. One feels include in the unraveling. We're right there with Watson (who in this movie, is quite spry for a man with a permanent war injury) Here, Ritchie holds out on us, keeping the mechanics of the mystery entirely to himself. The larger mystery afoot exists for no other purpose than to make a sequel.Why such failure in maintaining the soul of Holmes? Because Ritchie doesn't care about the mystery. He drowns the film in cool, in showy camera angles, manically (and confusingly cut) action and the whole affair is drummed up with buddy-movie comedic angle that falls flat. It's just not funny. The shifts in tone from funny, to mysterious, to thrilling, to dramatic, are jarring, barely held together at the seams. It's ultimately a crushing bore, lacking any sort of narrative momentum.Guy Ritchie has undeniable talent as stylist. He'll can make a worthwhile movie. No one who works that hard with that much raw talent will just fade away. He needs to another round at bat to prove that too us again.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

A very good film.,"To be frank, this film has been given some massive amounts of publicity. As well as the reputation of the name Sherlock Holmes, this film is bound to be successful in the box office. Not to mention the actors and director, in which we expect a lot from.I haven't read any of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's books about the great detective Sherlock Holmes. So this review will be based upon whatever I have seen and I will rate it for what I saw, not how accurate or how there is a miscasted Sherlock Holmes is. To be honest, I have seen many of these Sherlock Holmes fanboys complaining about how inaccurate this film is, I really don't care. We live in the 21st century, things change, just because you think how perfect that actor 40 years old played Sherlock Holmes should be casted, sorry, his dead. There have been films of Sherlock Holmes which are played by the 'more suited' actors, but sorry, how successful were they? This one is going for a wider audience.The film starts instantly with a crime, all of a sudden with questions and gets into the point fast.I've been a Guy Ritchie fan ever since Lock, stock and two smokin' barrels. And I can easily say that he is one of my favourite director. Guy Ritchie adds his own touch of 'first do, explain later' which really made the film more interesting. You always wanted to you know why, how, or when.I really don't have to talk about the actors, with reputation for all four actors you guess they'll do an exception job, which they did. I found the chemistry of Judd Law and RDJ really real and it felt they belonged to together. Not for the second did i think that they were lovers, as some people argued. They are just two good mates.Guy Ritchie depicts the Victorian times perfectly. From the clothes that were worn, to the way the streets were paved. The costumes were top notch (I hope I see them getting an Oscar nomination for that category). The CGI scenes, which were not overused nor needed for most parts were done excellently. I found them feeling really realistic. from the ship scene and the bridge.Humour was a big part in the film. I found it to be quite funny. Although most of the 'laugh out loud' scenes were exclusive to the trailers, It still had more humour than I expected. The theatre laughed at almost all the jokes and I laughed a little extra.In conclusion, the film has shown some great acting by the lead roles, a magnificent setting of the Victorian times along with a good plot with tasteful humour. Sherlock Holmes is a franchise that will make millions not matter how crap the films are. There are always people will want to watch it. Guy Ritchie has implemented his trademark directorial skills which made the film more interesting.Acting/cast: 5/5 Plot/dialogue: 4/5 Music/score: 5/5 CGI/depiction:5/5 4/5",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

"The film presents the overall quality exquisite technique, good direction, but with a flawed script. In the end is actually a series of twists predictable and common solutions","In this film the detective Sherlock Holmes is known for his knowledge of chemistry, deductive reasoning and logical in their cases is always with his faithful partner physician, Dr. John Watson. Since Watson is about to marry Mary and abandon the investigation cases with friend in his last case, they try to unmask the Lord Blackwood, who ends up being arrested by them in a macabre ritual that included the death of a young woman. He is arrested and sentenced to hang, and after his death is examined by Dr. Watson attests his death. However, when a gravedigger claims to have seen Lord Blackwood leave his grave and when the double checks the pit and raped another body inside it, there is a great mystery. When the duo is hired to unravel this mystery, the knowledge and skills of Holmes and Watson are put to the test as Holmes does not believe in magic. Parallel to the case, the impending marriage of Watson still comes back an old love from the past and Holmes experienced a thief, Irene Adler.Though not fit biotype physical title character long, described as being tall with more than 1.80 m, very thin, pale and thin nose with Robert Downey Jr fits very well in his role, and the example of Tony Starck franchise in ""Iron Man"", he lends all his wit, sense of humor and mannerisms for the composition of this character. Holmes in this film loses elegance and typically English phlegm, but its main features are present: his intelligence, quick wit, flawless deduction method. The air more serious and more ""classic"" character gives way to a more youthful, modern, ironic, more manly and more frantic this long, with Holmes being a kind of superhero with everything being maximized in their scenes. We can notice here that every movement of Holmes is calculated and well thought out especially in scenes melee, another feature of the character had as a practitioner of martial arts like boxing. His arrogant personality, the intellectual struggle between him and Watson living confronting the field of various subjects related to chemistry, physics and other fields of science and general knowledge are present here as well, and one of his specialties: the disguise, as in the scene where he chases Irene to her carriage. As already mentioned, Jude Law is sublime scene and is the counterpoint and simultaneously support Holmes, with two locking great dialogues emphasizing his friendship above all. Here it is not only the support and has its own personality and well defined. The scenes in slow motion are an interesting counterpoint to the scenes of fast action and quick dialogues.Regarding the rest of the cast, Rachel McAdams appears beautiful as ever, but without much function is overshadowed by the duo Holmes and Watson. It serves to show some of the human side of Holmes that he seems to have feelings and swing by and introduce thief mysteriously enemy Professor Moriarty would start stick prominence in films ahead of the character. Another shows that the more human side of Holmes is Watson, with the excuse that their marriage causes side possessive and sentimental character as rational, precise and calculating. Kelly Reilly is beautiful on the scene making Mary a woman of character and not so fragile. Already Mark Strong emerges as the villain and does work just fine, getting threat display, coldness and calculous Blackwood giving work to the English hero.One of the problems that Guy Ritchie did not know so well was set the path to be followed in the production, sometimes walking on land more realistic, sometimes going to the supernatural. The film begins with fantastic realism, will look more realistic and ends with a more supernatural side by the end proved not as supernatural as well. Despite this indecision, suspense, building the mystery and the clues that Holmes heads to the revelation of the mystery allied with the action scenes often forced as the scene of the ship at the pier where he dueled with an opponent and the final scene on the bridge. Another point is the rapidity with which the explanations for the slopes are not shown sometimes leaving the audience thinking and go create your own puzzle trying to unravel the mystery with Sherlock. The final explanations ""Played in the face of the viewer"" explaining the details of the plan have some explanations as implausible the stairs of the tomb. Impossible not to notice some revelations that border on the absurd with the aforementioned and finding some clichés of the genre.Well as maintaining the key characteristics of the characters and present a good story despite some points already mentioned, it is impossible not to mention the art direction, costumes and photography impeccable and extraordinary to present a Victorian London shown in the details. The creation of this world of Sherlock was instrumental in this work to immerse ourselves in the adventure. And director Guy Ritchie takes advantage of that by creating multiple plans in the sequence leading to the grand streets and modern London and indoor environments typical of the time. In fact, it is one of the best works of recent years in both areas and worthy of applause. The issue as I briefly mentioned earlier, it is fast and knows how to use slow motion at the same time and taking some scenes in which the action is cut off abruptly, it is also a job satisfactorily, especially the opening scene with the logo of Warner Bros on the streets of London and the whole sequence initial invasion of local ritual orchestrated by Lord Blackwood. And how not to talk this opening scene and the rest of the film without mentioning the soundtrack master Hans Zimmer? Zimmer can be more classic and perfectly set the moments of action and suspense with the sensitivity of a few. The theme of the opening scene and the closing credits show and are well suited.The film presents the overall quality exquisite technique, good direction, but with a flawed script trying to rummage to a story that in the end is actually a series of twists predictable and common solutions. But anyway, have fun and is always nice to see a character as enigmatic as this in theaters, even when it is so well composed as it was by Downey Jr. Ends up being a film friendly and enjoyable to see in the minutes go by and you do not realize. In the remaining burst popcorn and good fun.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

Impeccable,"What comes to our mind when wit meets excellence - Robert Down Jr...this fact is well explained in this movie. From the plot, storyline, action, drama, comedy everything seemed to be so perfectly placed. The interconnections and not a missing link leave the viewer amazed with excitement.
The brilliance lies in the creativity of Sherlock and his ability at seeing things with a different view. That is reason he benefits at finding the logical explanations of Lord Blackwood's evil activities. Lord Blackwood is shows himself as the Lord of the dark using the marvels of science. 
The first encounter of Sherlock and Mary at dinner and Sherlock using his intelligence at deciphering the details is one of the most comical moments. Dr Watson, a good friend has to suffer being a companion of Sherlock but is a die hard friend who never backs out. 
The cinematography and portrayal of the 19th Century civilization is done as a marvel and so is the acting. The most brilliant was the fight at the dockyard and release of the ship and gear almost killing Sherlock---realistic. 
But the most beauty was the sound effects that were perfectly timed and executed. From the subtle movement to the action packed fight one could find the brilliant sound effects.

An insult to Arthur Conan Doyle,"Buried underneath a ton of special effects and obligatory action (to keep the audience riveted) lay a poorly devised character of a a 19th-century consulting detective, with an 18th century hair-do, and late-20th-century weapons, poorly disguised to look like something from steam-punk. (Psst- they didn't chrome-plate their pistols in those days.) Another Hollywood butcher job, re-writing history, and the intentions of the authors who originally presented it. The plot could not have been more transparent had it been made of glass--exposing the metaphysical as tricks of science and engineering. And Irene Adler... would have been arrested for dressing the way she did. But, of course... that's Hollywood. And Downey should be ashamed of himself... trying to make Holmes look like an Einstein Emo. He looked like a heroin addict, not like someone who took a 7% solution of cocaine when feeling bored. Totally disappointing.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Holmes remade as an action hero,"This version begins with a fist fight involving Holmes at a gambling den. Naturally Holmes walks away the victor. The scene signals clearly that this version is not going to follow in the footsteps of its many predecessors. So, if you have read the original Holmes stories, or seen any of the many previous Holmes adaptations, particularly those from the 40's with Basil Rathbone, you will probably be shocked and disappointed to see Holmes portrayed as a sort of cartoonish James Bond/Batman character. There are more fist fights, chases, heroine in distress scenes, and a finale atop the Tower Bridge. Although this is a period piece purportedly set in London during the 1800's, to me it lacked authenticity mainly because of the cartoonish nature of the film. It seemed that the film was really a superhero movie but with the superhero having a keen sense of observation instead of magical powers. There were times when some of the actors lost their British accents and one scene in which one of the detectives clearly spoke in an American accent. So, director Ritchie seems not to have cared much for authenticity but rather went for an action joyride. On that level, the film is not so bad, much like a National Treasure or DaVinci Code. Robert Downey Jr. portrays Holmes as a tormented, depressed soul, never clean-shaven, clearly a personal slob, witness his disgustingly slovenly digs, with no manners and a pugilistic side. Jude Law's Dr. Watson is more like Robin to Batman and he is more than willing to join Holmes in fisticuffs as they fight off one thug after another. There are Holmes references in the film, as to Professor Moriarty, but unless you are already familiar with characters from the Doyle stories, you will not understand them, nor are they explained at all. Clearly there will be at least one sequel. The film is clearly aimed at younger people and will probably provide them with 3 hours of non-stop action entertainment.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Action Holmes,"Sherlock Holmes was suppose to be a mystery/thriller. It's shocking to see Sherlock Holmes doing martial arts. Filmmakers might thought that the movie will be better if they put a lot of action scenes in this movie. The action scenes were awesome. Sherlock Holmes is entertaining, nice casting, but it is disappointing that the movie has less mystery and more action. The story was okay, but it is not really mysterious. it has a lot of action and suspense but less mystery. the action didn't ruined the film, it made it more entertaining and fun. First i thought the action scenes are slow-mo like Watchmen, good thing is it's not. the directing was great. The picture London in Sherlock Holmes looks the same thing in Sweeney Todd. The music score was cool, it really fit to a detective movie. I liked the casting. Robert Downey Jr.'s Sherlock Holmes is like Dr. House which is funny. Mark Strong is a cool villain. Sherlock Holmes is an entertaining film but you should expect for the action and breath-taking scenes not the mystery. nice casting, great directing, and cool music score.4/5 stars",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Not Flawless, But One of the More Under-Rated Films of the Year","Sherlock Holmes and his faithful assistant Watson are on the case of a man who has seemingly risen from the dead to terrorize London. While the police seem clueless, Holmes is on top of things, and while his methods are unorthodox, they just might work.Robert Downey Jr. is great in anything he does, but he makes a particularly fine Sherlock Holmes -- the English equivalent of Tony Stark. Jude Law is a respectable Dr. John Watson, and fleshes out what could have been a forgettable character. Rachel McAdams plays Irene Adler, the love interest. I have a personal dislike for McAdams and view her as the weak part of the film, but that's likely just my own bias.The cinematography in the film was great, but almost too polished at times, clearly computerized. This is a new venture for Guy Ritchie, who also has ventured away from the 'R' rating for the first time. He does, though, push the boundaries a bit. Ritchie was also said to remove Holmes' hat, and the line ""elementary"", which was clearly a good move... Ritchie has proved himself capable of much more than gangster flicks.Some people have claimed the film has homoerotic undertones, while others have denied any such thing. I saw it immediately. You may write it off as ""friendship"", but there are plenty of lines that blurred the picture and the entire dinner scene with Mary was very tense in a jealous lover sort of sense.Hans Zimmer was robbed. If this film has no other Oscar-worthy things going for it (and that may well be true), Zimmer's score blew me away and really drove the film. I don't mean to say that the winner's score was bad, but if anyone thinks that Zimmer didn't take this music and thrust it into a whole new level of powerful soundscaping, you are deaf.What this film probably does best is sets up for a sequel that could outdo the first... recall how ""Batman Begins"" left an opening for ""The Dark Knight""? A similar act is followed here. And while no sequel has been officially announced to my knowledge, I have to say that it's one of the most anticipated upcoming films for me... by and large because of the build-up created here.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

Fun Guy Ritchie nonsense and I love it; Would Recommend,"'Sherlock Holmes' was directed by Guy Ritchie and stars Robert Downey Jr, Jude Law and Mark Strong. It is the story of world famous British icon, Sherlock Holmes(Robert Downey Jr) and his equally famous sidekick, Dr Jon Watson(Jude Law) who go on the hunt of the mysterious dark wizard, Lord Blackwood(Mark Strong). It is up to Holmes and co to solve this dark villain's plan before it's too late, and he has the entire of London under his spell.This movie is weird. I can't explain specifically why I like this movie, I just do. It's fun, it's weird and it's full of ye olde Guy Ritchie-isms so what's not to love? The story was engaging, the characters are classical but done justice and it's a Guy Ritchie movie. The action is, of course, Guy Ritchie. The dialogue is, of course, Guy Ritchie. This movie contains more Guy Ritchie than his birth certificate. It's a well though out movie and I do recommend you see if because you'll probably get a kick or two out of it.The story, for starters, is very engaging and contains a classical Sherlock Holmes-esc mystery. Of course you only watch a good 'ol mystery for the grand reveal(and this is no exception) but it provides you with a fun, interesting and unique example of Holmes' classic array of stories. I will say that some parts of the movie(for example 'Teleportation' were explained about as well as a gorilla trying to teach someone how not to get shot(too soon?). This movie is also made to setup a sequel(which I'm fine with) but I feel they took too much time focusing on setting up that sequel than they did focusing on the movie.Robert 'The Drug Addiction'(Still love ya Robert) Downey Jr was pretty good as the titular character but he did come of as a tad too comical at points which I suppose fit the character but came off as a little forced and weird. Jude Law was fine as Watson and I can tell he relished in this role. Mark Strong was fine as Lord Blackwood but I think that his character only showed up at random intervals in the plot and merely served as a way to progress the plot along. Rachel McAdams was fine as Irene Adler.Technically speaking, this is a Guy Ritchie movie and is primarily style over substance. That is completely fine in this movie and it is stylistically beautiful. The costume design was great(as was the set design) and looked realistic considering the time period this movie was set in. The cinematography in this movie was very good as per Guy Ritchie fashion and everything part of it screams Ritchie.The action in this movie was pretty good but it did become a tad bit repetitive, especially considering it was the same hand-to-hand combat consistently. Not to say that the slo-mo sections of it were very well done and looked just awesome. The humour worked well but I think that is just down to Downey's charisma and less down to the 'Oscar Worthy' writing.The actual 'Sherlock Holmes' theme of this movie was excellent and very enjoyable. The other uses of music paled in comparison and didn't work too well.In conclusion, if you can handle enough Guy Ritchie to paralyse an elephant then you'll probably enjoy this movie. It's got fun(sometimes bland) action, witty humour and is all around a good time. It is definitely more stylistic than substance which is fine and shouldn't bother many people but I do understand if it does. I do recommend this movie and I think it's a good re-imagining of this character.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
A Riveting Supernaturally Tinged Mystery Thriller,"27 December 2009. Downey and Jude Law bring an uneasy but fascinating chemistry to this crime-solving duo along with some finely crafted musical background and some powerful and compelling action scenes. The haunting and mysterious supernatural events hang ominously through out this movie bringing even more suspense and tension. The only apparent weaknesses are some of the fighting scenes which unlike BOURNE IDENTITY seem to be distractive and confusing rather than compellingly inviting and some difficulty in understanding some of the dialogue, SHERLOCK HOLMES is nicely editing with good pacing and some attractive and densely layered set designs. Overall, this movie is nicely balanced with a solid script with good explanations where necessary, little or no lose ends (except for the sequel) and is weighted with good emotional weight making this movie much more intellectually and qualitatively satisfying.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Sherlock Holmes deserved better support in solving the movie apaptation case!,"Depicting too many details is a classic Sherlock Holmes trait from the timeless sleuth stories of the infamous detective scribed by the late Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Unfortunately, Director Guy Ritchie took that to an extreme level by ingesting his film adaptation of ""Sherlock Holmes"" with TMI syndrome which caused a severe case of cluttermania to the baffled viewer. The ""Sherlock Holmes"" plot focuses on a deranged Lord Blackwood who has a Gothic sinister plot to rule the world. But Holme don't play that, so it is up to Sherlock and his BFF Dr. Watson to stop the Blackwood Magic Man to cause havoc to England and the rest of the world. Seems like ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"" and this worn-out plot formula continues to bring out tears & fears in me. It took a scribe team of five screenwriters to peg the ""Sherlock Holmes"" movie story down. I am no Sherlock Holmes, but that was significant probable cause of the writing offense of the movie. Again, excess is not best. Another piece of evidence that hurt the film was the humdrum performance of Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler, a former Sherlock fem conquest who might or might not be betraying the Sherlock. However, not every case was cold in ""Sherlock Holmes"". Robert Downey Jr. was delightfully divine as Sherlock Holmes, and Jude Law was efficiently operable as Dr. Watson. Their character chemistry was more than elementary, it was exemplary. The film's cinematography & art direction also got passing grades for their effective ""mise en scene"" to old England. Unfortunately, those positive contributions did not provide sufficient evidence to give some ""pipe dream"" positive recommendation to the overrated & over-hyped ""Sherlock Holmes"". *** Average",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

"Entertaining, style over substance","There's something so appealing about the concept of Sherlock Holmes, the character. Someone so purely intelligent, he can work things out with so few explicit hints. He notices what many of us miss. It's actually very realistic. And the way I read the character, he isn't arrogant at all, but simply bored by people with weaker minds. I relate to this a lot, my sarcasm often being confused with snobbery or malevolence. It's boredom.This movie gives us a more stylised and action-packed version of Holmes. I don't mind the action, but it seems to work a little against the concept of Holmes. What's the point of using your brain if you can just pummel your way through your enemies? Why solve a puzzle if you can use brute force? Holmes struck me as someone who didn't need to fight because of his intellect - being so far ahead of everyone else.Seeing Holmes plan out his moves is kind of cool, but it quickly becomes a repetitive gimmick. And it's a bit silly seeing the same fight scene twice in a row. It's also misleading since fights are very chaotic and hard to predict (as are chess games, as I know well from experience), even by the best fighters.Law and Downey, Jr. Are likeable, but in some ways they're too similar. Watson is meant to be smart, but Holmes is meant to be a one-of-a-kind genius. Here he seems wreckless and only slightly more clever than his sidekick or enemies. They both fight, work things out and have clever quips. It works better with a bigger imbalance. Watson smart but seldom able to keep up with his friend.Mark Strong is decent as the bad guy, although he seems to have been typecast in this kind of role for many years now. Rachel McAdams is nice but it seems a little too convenient that she's as smart and slippery as Holmes. Is everyone a genius in this universe?Although the style is pretty cool, and certainly confident, it covers for a lack of substance. These versions of the characters just aren't that interesting. It feels like we're told that Holmes is smart, not shown it. And he seems smug. The machinations of the plot are confusing in their details, but predictable overall. And there are too many far-fetched ideas for my liking, especially the things people seem to be able to survive.One major issue is that we don't get to properly participate in the mystery. A good mystery film gives us clues. There's enough to work things out for yourself. But this movie only tells us the clues after the fact. It might make Holmes look smart, but only because he noticed details we weren't even shown. I'd much prefer if the relevant information was plain on the screen for us to pick up on. It's too contrived and is heavier with cliches of being smart than actually being smart.Still, it's pretty fun overall, but silly fun at that. A loose version of Holmes rather than a faithful one. But better than many movies of similar genre.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
out of step ...,"... me, i imagine, not the movie. the modern movie viewer obviously likes this ""edgy, action-packed, gratuitously violent"" junk because it permeates the screen these days. i knew i was in trouble after five minutes in my seat watching the previews of soon-to-be-released movies -- all pubescent shoot-em-up, blow-em-apart nonsense. i might have given it three stars except for the obvious set up for the sequel ""Sherlock Holmes Two: Moriarty Teaches Calculus Badly.""ugh.let's see ... too loud, too exaggerated, too violent, too edgy, too much.i'm tired of looking at actors standing in front of computer generated screens. at some point, maybe modern audiences will stop saying ""oooh aah,"" and look for some artistry.one could hardly call this a**spoiler alert**as the next remake of ""Bambi"" will, no doubt, contain the obligatory checklist of ""action-packed adventure"" scenes, but i'm really tired of fight clubs, explosions, burning bodies, slow motion mutilation of human faces, etc.if they can actually sit through it, Arthur Conan Doyle fans will enjoy the variety of allusions to his work. i had fun picking out lines and, during the too infrequent scenes where people were actually trying to talk to one another, noting traces of character in the characters. at times there was a glimmer of rapport between Holmes and Watson (Irene Adler was weak, the rest of the cast cardboard cutouts). unfortunately, i suspect Arthur Conan Doyle fans will be spending most of their time cringing.please, do yourself a favor, if you really have an interest in the Holmes stories and, if you haven't done so already, read ""a study in scarlet"" and ""the adventures of Sherlock Holmes."" then go rent a few of the Granada television adaptations with Jeremy Brett and David Burke. you will enjoy some first-rate detective stories; well-written, well-adapted, and well-acted. i know that's where i'm headed right now to get that nauseating taste out of my mouth from bad popcorn and a bad movie.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Entertaining - worth adding to your collection!,"I would first discuss three things that I liked in this movie the most.1) The eccentric characterization of characters in lead. The happy go lazy attitude of Sherlock and his bizarre experiments until he finds something solid to work upon. To add further it's about the other lead the good guy Watson, who despite of all odds cannot keep away from Sherlock even after considering all his losses.2) The second thing I liked was pre-planning the execution of the fights all in imagination at once. It was all shown in slow motion. It was tremendous and mesmerizing.3) The third thing that I liked was cinematography. It was impeccable. I sometimes feel that comes mostly with the budget.Tone, Script & Story: The movie highlights one of the cases Sherlock and his team dealt with.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: Direction was good. Directors (Guy Ritchie's) three best in order until today are - 1) Snatch (2000), 2) Sherlock Holmes (2009) and Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011). Screen play was very good.

Well colour me surprised. Sherlock Holmes is quite good.,"As anyone over say 25 knows Sherlock Holmes is a fictional character renowned for his powers of deduction and reasoning. Funny that anyone under 25 will think Holmes is ""that movie guy who mumbles his lines and does parkour"".Nevertheless that's what is on display here. Holmes (Robert Downey Jr) and his loyal sidekick Dr Watson (Jude Law) kick-ass and dust for clues all over 18th Century England trying to hunt down a master criminal using only the power of Holmes's massively intuitive melon.Fortunately there are a lot of things in the movie to deduce, although I think in the scene where they spent many minutes trying to work out how to get away from a band-saw might have been fast tracked by simply hitting the sawblade with a brick. Those things might cut through flesh like butter but they are brittle as a cracker if you hit them on the side.Moving on...Early in the piece Holmes and Watson end the reign of terror - and the life - of naughty man Lord Blackwood. Well imagine everyone's surprise when they are asked to solve another case, the case of why Lord Blackwood is back and wreaking havoc all over London with his zany satanic rituals and murderousness.Rachel McAdams is Holmes's love interest and apparently somewhat of a master gold-digging criminal herself, for some reason she fascinates Holmes. Maybe it's her rack? As always on these things the detectives don't find themselves on ""a"" case, but ""the"" case. The case takes them through both the darker more sinister areas of London and all the way to the heads of Government - or are those things both the same? Downey Jr is at times hard to hear with his mumbling, but as always he remains interesting. Jude Law solidifies his position as the prettiest male actor still able to achieve some form of street cred (albeit cobblestone streets) and Rachel McAdams runs around wearing big dresses and will no doubt tell interviewers on her next film that she did the film because ""it can't all be about the awards all the time"".Guy Ritchie has never had a bigger budget and although nothing about this film screams All Time great it is a fun movie and moves along at pace. A couple of the setpieces worked very well and a sequence of explosions in particular appeared very dangerous and effectively drew me into the action. After Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels I thought Ritchie had a long career as an A grader ahead of him, then came Snatch which was only a minor notch down, then a couple of howlers. I'm glad he's found his swagger again here and think he deserves a budget that allows him to be more creative, after all if Zack Snyder and M. Night Shamalamadingdong keep getting work based upon a solid debut Ritchie is deserved of a couple more shots - after all the guy put up with Madonna for the better part of a decade as she transitioned from pop star to scary muscleman.Final Rating - 7.5 / 10.

the nadir,"I guess what is more depressing than this abominable movie is the many laudatory reviews I have read here. Are audiences today so jaded, so utterly disconnected from even their recent past, so completely lobotomized that they would find kind words to say about such dreck as this? I had thought that the unspeakable 1979 pastiche of HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES with Dudley Moore was about as low as one could get in the filming of a Sherlock Holmes story. I was clearly wrong. This is the end, the limit, the bottom of the calcium-encrusted barrel. Holmes admirers (those who understand and appreciate the fine originals) will stay away in droves if for no other reason than the hilarious miscasting of the lead characters. Mr Downey as Holmes and Mr Law as Watson rank right up there with such inspired casting choices as Tony Curtis playing a medieval knight and Sharon Stone playing a gunfighter of the old west. Ridiculous.I doubt that Hollywood's renowned contempt for its audiences can be better illustrated than by this movie. Do moviegoers really enjoy having their intelligences insulted with such grand insouciance?It is both pointless and useless to go on. We have given up what little culture we have left by allowing these amateurs to take great classics and turn them into idiotic roller-coaster rides. A paying public that can applaud, let alone part with the money to see, such a movie is clearly a public that can no longer recognize quality.Some years ago, just before he passed away, the great producer Darryl Zanuck said ""I know audiences feed on cr_p. But I cannot believe we are so lacking in ability that we cannot dish it up to them with a little style"". Why bother, Mr Zanuck?

A Superb Delight,"Wildly clever and wonderfully entertaining, Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes surpasses all expectations I had for the film, and takes a place as one of my favorite mysteries of the decade. Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law play Holmes and Watson, and both do so with great ease. Downey Jr. is by far the greatest standout in the film, truly capturing the mind of the character, while also giving him some much needed human qualities. Rachel McAdams also gives a grand performance as Irene Adler, and is certainly a character I will be hoping to see in future sequels. The film is quite enjoyable, with the pacing never seeming too slow, and the story keeping together quite well, despite some hard-to-follow attempts of showing certain events all the way through. The music in the film truly adds to the atmosphere and is quite delightful, as well as the costumes and set pieces throughout. Mark Strong's character of Lord Blackwood does seem a bit overdone at times, but it's all in good fun for a truly engaging and delightful mystery. In the end, Sherlock Holmes is one of the most enjoyable mysteries I have seen in quite a while, and I will be looking forward to what this duo uncovers next.

"Characters, Graphics, Rating","The characters in this film were chosen well. Robert Downey Jr. as Holmes was the best choice of all possible actors. His ability to act with a minor sense of schizophrenia really helped set the character of Sherlock Holmes aside from the rest. As for Jude Law playing Watson, bravo for being able to pull off the role of best friend and colleague and keeping the two separate enough to not interfere with work but also allow for the work to be more productive because they know each other on a personal level and know how the other thinks. Rachel McAdams was a wonderful choice in actress for playing the role of Irene Adler because she has been featured in films that make her out to be slightly promiscuous, which helped immensely for this film. She is also very convincing as a ""double agent"".The film is rated PG-13 for one scene of suggestive material as well as violence. I'd say this is an adequate rating due to all the gunfights that occur throughout the film. I would recommend watching it before you let small children view the film, but anyone over the age of 11 or 12 should be able to handle the film in it's entirety.The graphics in the film are superb. There is nothing that seems to be too obvious that it may be a green screen, nothing that takes away from the illusions the movie creates. They did a wonderful job making it seem so realistic. Scenes in which the entire set blows up are wonderfully directed and filmed. It also helps that the actors/actresses they have chosen to be in the film did a phenomenal job at acting like they were really happening directly behind them and beside them.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Not bad, for a travesty","On the one hand turning Arthur Conan Doyle's cerebral Victorian detective into a scruffy action hero is a terrible idea (and formally speaking, a travesty). On the other hand, Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law (as Holmes and Watson) are (however dubious the conception) excellent in their roles, and this is the most coherent, as well as the most expensive, film the ham-handedly hip British director Guy Ritchie, perhaps most famous as Madonna's ex, has ever done.Having been steeped in Sherlock Holmes stories as a youth, I can recognize all the many trappings, characters, and ideas of the originals that are carried over into this Christmas Day blockbuster, while finding none of the original atmosphere and personalities here at all. Partly my sense of outrage is due to reading at least a very large chunk of an old but richly satisfying Complete Sherlock Holmes, a thick volume on tissue-thin India paper. Partly it's due to seeing various previous Holmes incarnations on film, which go back over a century. The preeminent incarnation was undoubtedly Basil Rathbone's tall, deep- voiced, long-faced version, with the big meerschaum pipe (now taken over by Tarantino's juicy Nazi villain Col. Landa), the tweeds, the cape-like overcoat, the deerstalker hat, and the traditional lines, of which ""Elementary, my dear Watson"" is the most famous. Above all it was the voice, rich, resonant, elegantly West End English, utterly authoritative. Robert Downey Jr.'s staccato delivery is witty. It's not always quite audible. He's thrown away the deerstalker and the meerschaum for a straight black pipe and a bowler. And that's fine because he doesn't seem anything like Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Holmes. Downey Jr. likes to toss off his lines; sometimes they fall before we've caught them. He's bright and quick witted and his motormouthed manner has always been above all suited to keeping the ball rolling. He does that fine here, and he and Jude Law play off each other with excellent chemistry. It's all a lark. And a very well-tooled disaster. Because somehow the action of this actioner doesn't matter. The villain isn't really scary, the danger doesn't feel dangerous, the suspense isn't suspenseful. It's fast and skillful and complicated and loud and sometimes in its overly-dark processed way rather beautiful (like female interests Rachel McAdams and Kelly Reilly), but it doesn't grab you.It's okay to design a modern Sherlock Holmes, I guess. But if you do, why steep your movie in Victorian atmosphere? Ritchie's costly film, rich in CGI and spectacular action set pieces, is set in the grimiest of 19th century Londons, with an elegantly slovenly Sherlock Holmes to match. Every moment and every scene is designed to tell us this is Sherlock Holmes, but every moment of every scene has elements in it to tell us that Sherlock Holmes is absolutely what this is not.Traditionally Holmes is the quintessential intellectual sleuth. You've got that here. Robert Downey Jr's Holmes is a keen observer of detail; he can tell just by scrutinizing her person that Watson's fiancée has had a previous failed engagement -- much to her annoyance, and pointlessly; Watson already knew this. Holmes is also a clever inventor -- like his evil adversary, Lord Blackwood. (This individual is played by Mark Strong, who is the villain in two movies opening this week, this and Young Victoria, where he is the evil Lord Conroy. Is England short on villain material nowadays, or were all the other candidates working on a new political satire with Armando Iannucci and Peter Capaldi?)Anyway, the trouble with Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes, which looks like it's set up for a sequel, judging by the way Holmes' perennial opponent Professor Moriarity is mentioned at the end, is not that anything whatsoever is left out. It's that nothing is left out, and on top of all the traditional trappings (slightly distorted, like turning the deerstalker into a bowler), too much is added, of a very distracting and inappropriate nature. All the details of 221B Baker Street and of Holmes and Watson, now locked into an amped-up love-hate relationship that needs a fiancée to save the pair from Brokeback Mountain overtones, are dutifully, if not lovingly, preserved, along with the rationcination and the battles of wits with a fiendishly malevolent opponent, only this has been plugged into an action movie matrix, with Holmes additionally transformed into a martial arts master skilled at bruising organs and smashing bones, and with this comes all the loud noise and speeded up and slowed down CGI-assisted footage and hypertrophied musical background complete with bangs and thumps. It's about like the way the disco team of Walter Murphy and the Big Apple Band redid Beethoven's Fifth Symphony as ""A Fifth of Beethoven.""All this is great for action blockbuster fans. Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes is a relief from the ponderous over-signifying of the genre. This is a lark, though sometimes a brutal one. But mostly as A.O. Scott says this movie Sherlock has ""loutish, laddish cool"", and the movie is ""a series of ""poses and stunts"" that are ""intermittently diverting."" But supposing you're a lover of Beethoven: how much will you get out of Walter Murphy and the Big Apple Band? Not a whole lot. And ultimately there's not a whole lot here, which, come to think of it, despite all the extra millions added in the production this time, has always been true of Guy Ritchie's movies. Some people aren't very good, and yet they keep getting promoted to better-paying jobs. But it's not that Ritchie has no talent, and certainly not true that he has no energy. But as somebody said, his trouble is he doesn't care about character, theme, or even storytelling; he only cares about being cool. Here, he doesn't care about the mystery. And that's the answer to the mystery of why this movie leaves you cold.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

"Not bad, but...","If this has any other title, i would think it was a brilliant movie. Funny, action packed, itriguing... alas, it is called sherlock Holmes. When i was young, i was an avid reader of sherlock Holmes books. i read the likes of 'the speckled band', 'the hounds of baskerville', etc. How did sherlock became a pro fighter? And why is he such an asshole? Like always making Mary and Watson mad. Sure, he's a genius, but in no way does he demonstrate his smartness like some obnoxious egomaniac, like how he did with Mary. like, oh, you're a governess, you... then he prattles on and on. Sherlock Holmes is supposed to be a brilliant man, but nice too. And Irene Adler is a slut! Stripping sherlock, kissing him?

Searching for Sherlock,"I grew up reading Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's novels and I could still read them. This is because his novels can wake up imagination of the child and yet they have style and class to involve any adult into the story. I can say that this is the case with most of the Sherlock Holmes movies I had seen before I saw this one as they engage you by using the intelligent plot, first of all. 2009 Sherlock Holmes is a ridiculous attempt to turn a legendary detective into a Mission Impossible character and Dr. Watson into James Bond, Sean Connery style. Fast actions with special effects and very poor plot development are typical failures of this sterile Hollywood style project which has nothing to do with Sherlock. As I already mentioned partly, character of Dr Watson overpowers must dominating figure of Sherlock Holmes, which is sooo amateurish. Sherlock Holmes casting is a total failure, this guy matches Sherlock Holmes character as much as Sylvester Stallone. All in all, this is the bad time for Sherlock Holmes lovers.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
pretty solid,"I would argue Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock is superior to Robert Downey Jr's but they both did fantastic. The CGI in this movie is a little iffy at times but it was 2009 so it's understandable. I thought the plot was alright but the Sherlock plots I'm used to (from the BBC show) tend to be a bit more confusing and convoluted than this one, with more red herrings and less explaining from Sherlock (Benedict's Sherlock prefers to run off after the killer with no explanation as to his motives or what he's talking about, which I found pleasantly bewildering).Anyway, I thought the combat was fun to watch and the acting was solid.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

"A remake of ""Batman Begins,"" not Sherlock Holmes","I just saw a remake of ""Batman Begins"" - it was called ""Sherlock Holmes"" with Robert Downey Jr.In both films, the charismatic leader of a secret society attempts to use fear (and chemistry) to rule the world, and at the story's end, the hero's most legendary villain is mentioned, dangled as a carrot in front of audiences' eyes... but you'll have to wait for the sequel, ""The Dark Sleuth"".Entertaining in spots, and at least some of the action scenes were fortified by showing Holmes using his brains before landing his punches, but really you could have applied any character names to Holmes and Watson as any similarity to the characters Downey and Law played is purely coincidental.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Downey's second best character,"The well-named Sherlock Holmes is in my opinion comparable to the acclaimed show Sherlock that came a year after release. Here, the formula of the slowing of time to show the thought process of Sherlock is of course well done with explanation. Robert Downey Jr. is obviously a great actor and does a great job at portraying the beloved detective. He seems to really put an emphasis on the crazy side of Sherlock here as opposed to the more chill Benedict Cumberbatch (this may have something to do with the makeup and costuming). The writing and Downey together create a character that blends very well with Rachel McAdams' character and creates an oddly satisfying relationship. I appreciate how Jude Law's Watson is portrayed as his own person and not just as Sherlock's sidekick. The violence seems unnecessary but at least the fast camera during makes for exciting moments. The villain is mediocre and the music is the fun late 1800s tunes that contrast with the more serious low and slow tunes at other points. Overall enjoyable, especially if you like Robert Downey Jr.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
a rollicking good time with a sophisticated blockbuster by Ritchie & company,"Sherlock Holmes has been done and revisited and re-baked so many times one wonder what else could be done with it (my first exposure wasn't even to Holmes directly but through Disney's Great Mouse Detective). So it was about time, I suppose, that Hollywood would tackle this as any other franchise and make it into a big smashing action movie... which sounds wrong, of course, as Holmes and Watson's adventures aren't meant to have super elaborate action set pieces or fights, and are more about the figuring-out of things and Holmes' dry wit and frustrating manner as a cocaine addict and eccentric personality. But luckily Guy Ritchie, making his first real step into a big studio situation (not his crime movies or misguided Madonna-inspired pics) is a success on a basic level: he gets audiences interested in the Sherlock Holmes detective story first, as well as the rapport between Holmes and Watson, and then lays in his own touches to the material.It's another of those stories that, oddly enough like Great Mouse Detective, is as simple a plan as a villain's plot could get: take over England. In this case we have Lord Blackwood (nefariously cold performance from Mark Strong), who it would appear has been practicing dark magic, and has killed five people. He's hanged, but it also appears that he has risen from the grave and puts forth a dastardly plot to ""change the course of the world"", as a villain like him would put it so bluntly, and it's up to Holmes to stop him. While figuring out what's going on in the story, the detective work of it all, is fascinating, it's not entirely the true draw of the film. If there's any invention in the plot it's in the ways that Blackwood uses confounded technology from a turn of the 20th century period that works on a level that's fresh for 2009 audiences.No, it's Robert Downey Jr and, also, Jude Law as Holmes and Watson, watching them on screen interacting with each other, interacting with others, and figuring out what's going to happen next (mostly this is Holmes, and nine times out of them he figures it out in an instant and spends most of his time explaining it away, accompanied by visuals), that makes it most compelling. Downey couldn't be more equipped to play a character like this, and like Iron Man it's a character that has more nuance and more going on under the surface than we might think looking at him. There's snark, there's sarcasm, there's a bad-ass bravura and a sense of entitlement to both characters, but in Holmes we see Downey (minus the coke habit of the original Doyle creation for a PG-13 rated film) tackle this iconic figure with the intelligence and grace found in previous versions, but his own spin on it as well. And Law is up to the challenge of Watson, even if, arguably, the roles could be reversed for the stars and played just as well.The action set-pieces are good... not always terribly original (oh, big guy vs. normal sized guy, haven't seen that before), and the final confrontation on the scaffolding of the bridge may go on a tad too long with the exposition. But all in all Ritchie gives a lot of the fights and action real excitement and energy; my favorite was Holmes, in an act of clairvoyance for the audience's sake, shows what he'll do in slow-motion and narration to an opponent in a bare-knuckle brawl, and then just does it in regular-speed film. It's a creative angle on it without going too predictable. Oh, and did I mention the music is just about perfect here? Listening to the few songs, and most notably the old-time charged Hans Zimmer score, adds pep and inspiration to a lot of scenes, the twang of the guitar or violins and other instruments usual to find in a blockbuster, but a welcome treat.Sherlock Holmes is fun times, a kind of one-shot graphic novel turned into a movie that deviates from prior times with the books and stories, and still works as entertainment. It's not high-art. It's Robert Downey Jr. smoking a pipe, looking joyfully mad, and a stylish (and satisfying) revamp on Victorian-era London. 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Good makeover on of Conan Doyle's ""Sherlock Holmes"", it's not an amazing film, but it was pretty good one","Director Guy Ritchie has tried to include something for everybody in the film - occult conspiracies, brutal fist-fights, a pretty face (or two) thrown in for good measure and you have all the ingredients for a fine non-summer blockbuster. Hans Zimmer's quirky score keeps the action moving along, cinematographer Philippe Rousselot's seductively dark cinematography gives London a Gothic atmosphere and the sets & costumes are all nicely stylized. Downey, Jr. and Jude Law are great fun together, Mark Strong is a suitably evil villain and even though the story has its flaws (for me, especially in a Dr. Watson fiancee Mary - Kelly Reilly) it is entertaining enough to fill the void between elaborate action sequences. However, it's at least 30 minutes too long and the film drags noticeably when Holmes and Watson aren't on screen together. At the end, ""Sherlock Holmes"" still was an enjoyable adventure and a worthy reboot of the franchise. As such it is a case that it is basically visual entertainment with action and quirky humor but for those who want more will find the convoluted mess of a story lacking. At the end, It's a rapidly paced and funny Victoriana adventure popcorn movie.Rating: 8-",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Elementary movie making.  Flawed but great.,"The new incarnation of Holmes by Robert Downie Jr is fascinating. His relationship with Watson (played by Jude Law) continues that enduring Holmesian 'is he, isn't he' gay frisson which is suitably mashed up with the introduction of female love interests on both sides (Law's played demurely - dully actually - by Kelly Reilly and Holmes' rather better by Rachel McAdams).Central to the film's success is Law and Downie Jr who really make you believe there is life in this as a new franchise. Both (yes even Law) are excellent. And especially when they are on screen together they are great; carrying off the dialogue knowingly and often laugh out loud funnily.It's a great smorgasbrod of action, humour and special effects with enough Holmsian explanation of who did what and why to keep the interest up.The set needs special mention as a London in which Tower Bridge is under construction plays a character role. It's really quite beguiling, and although much CAD is used it works.The effect of a ship (also under construction) being set loose down a slipway is eye boggling and the use of lots of flying objects heading for the camera genuinely makes you duck (so who needs 3D then?) Now for the bad news. It's long, way too long. And the story is pretty silly really. I won't bore you with the details here. The oft used metaphor of a raven of death marking character obliteration is naff (first year film school).But overall I give it a healthy 7.5 out of 10. (The scene in the boxing booth justifies entry alone.) Good honest entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

I expected more,"Is a good movie, but i expect much more, the could not find better actor for play this version of sherlock homes that robert downey junior, it is like a detective tony stark, the personality of tony stark and sherlock homes is very similar, downey junior put the fun in the movie. Jude Law plays dear watson role jeje watson it's more serious than homes, the complement each other. The chemistry between Downey Junior and Jude Law seems a little bit forced, besides the great friendship between their characters, this bound between them was not reflected in the screen, this thing is natural so i think the director did not notice that. I like Rachel Mcaddams, well she is beautiful lol. I think they have a great cast, a great story but the script and the way of tell the story were bad.

Bit too much action and not enough witty dialogue,"Started off REALLY well. I loved the fun dialogue between Watson and Holmes. But quickly descended into a non-stop sequence of fight scenes, edited so tightly you can't see what's going on. I wish there had been more of the banter and dialogue seen in the early scenes of the movie, like the restaurant scene with Watson's lady. Robert Downey Jr is very enjoyable as Holmes. I think perhaps Guy Ritchie used a lot of influences from Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone (listen to the score - sounds like Once Upon a Time in the West, and the hanging scene as well). Still, it is enjoyable enough and I was glad to see Holmes' detection techniques highlighted well. I think Conan Doyle will be spinning slightly in his grave mind you!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
An enjoyable romp,"Holmes, struggling to come to terms with Watson moving out to marry, is drawn into a case involving the apparent rise from the grave of Lord Blackwood, hung for a series of occult-linked murders. Complicating the matters is the return of Irene Adler, a woman Holmes is drawn to...The first thing to note about this new Sherlock Holmes movie is that it is not based on any one story. It's an original script that uses elements of the Holmes character, in what is essentially a period buddy movie. The banter between Holmes and Watson is pretty funny at times, and it is clear there is a close friendship between the two. It helps that Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law are both clearly having a lot of fun in the roles and this does come over to the audience.The supporting cast get mixed results. Mark Strong as Blackwood is a compelling villain. Eddie Marsan as Lestrade is also quite good. However, Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler does her best, but the part floats in and out of the movie at times, and she doesn't get a lot to do.The big surprise though is actually the director, Guy Ritchie. I've never been a huge fan of his work, but he does a very good job here. The pacing is just right, the humour works well, and the action sequences are well done.There are some nice touches, such as Holmes thinking out how to defeat an opponent in a fight, slowed down as he thinks it through, then showing at normal speed as it actually occurs. The visuals of Victorian London are impressive as are the sets and costumes.If there are concerns with the movie, it's actually in the interplay between Holmes and Watson. Although as I said it is funny, at times it comes over in a similar vein to humour in previous Joel Silver movies, such as Lethal Weapon. But it is a minor issue.In the end how much you enjoy this movie will actually depend on how you feel about Holmes and Watson. If you are a die-hard fan of the characters you may feel that the portrayals here are not the characters you know. If however you are not a massive fan, you may enjoy it as a well made, fun movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Sherlock Holmes: The Mystery genre's Golden Boy,"How can I even start. This is probably one of my top 10 movies of all time. The soundtrack created by Hans Zimmer melds perfectly with the action filled movie and its intense deductive scenes. This movie has never failed to entertain me with its snarky commentary or its comedic timings.The most impressive part of this movie was the immense attention to detail that this movie contains; they took what Sherlock said in the movie serious, that detail is perhaps the most important part. The movie makes a fine job of guiding us through Sherlock's deductive reasoning and all the cues he managed to piece together.Movies like these are the reason the mystery genre is as strong as ever. The iconic character brought to life by the great Robert Downey Jr. Did a splendid job at demonstrating why mystery is one of the most entertaining genres out there.Now we have to talk about the setting of the movie. My gosh, the production team for this movie did a stellar job at bringing the Victorian era England to life in this film. From the attire to the make up and props allowed this movie to be as immersive as it was.The writing was probably the most impressive aspect of this movie. The dialogues between Watson and Sherlock do a good job on expressing the bromance between them. The interactions between characters is what makes this movie so entertaining. It could be the synergy between Sherlock and Watson, or Irene and Sherlock's complicated relationship, or even the cooperative nature of Sherlock and the police. These interactions bring this movie life.Through and through, a great movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Ritchie's best film?  Elementary, of course!","Some of the sleuthing was very 'Hollywood'. There didn't appear to be much in the way of foreshadowing for viewers who like to play along and solve the mystery with Holmes step-by-step (I don't happen to be one of those people, however, so I didn't mind ) Downey's chemistry with the rest of the cast was excellent. The production design was great, and there were one or two stunning set-pieces carefully crafted and choreographed within the story.Mark Strong did very well with what seemed to me to be a very underwritten bad guy So much time is spent upon establishing the relationship between Holmes and Watson and setting up the mystery, that the villain's motivation and grand master plan doesn't receive the depth of explanation it perhaps warrants. This facet of the plot is pretty much dealt with in its entirety using only one scene.For those seeking more of an action-adventure than a procedural, this should be a treat. Stands in my opinion as Guy Ritchie's best film yet (although since I didn't like him much in the first place, that's perhaps not saying much!)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Unrelated to the detective of the same name,"I love Robert Downey Jr., and he's funny and engaging as always in the role he takes on in this film. Unfortunately, his character, though named after the ""Sherlock Homes"" invented by Arthur Conan Doyle, has almost nothing in common with his literary ancestor. This film's ""Holmes"" is a hyper-kinetic pugilist who excels at swinging numchuks, swan-diving into the Thames from second-story windows, and leaping about city buildings in a manner reminiscent of the Assassin's Creed video game franchise. For that matter, the hyper-real Victorian London of the film's exterior shots has a very similar computer-generated feel to it, one amplified when it vividly depicts the Tower of London on the wrong side of the Thames, among other gaffes.There is none of the cerebral intensity, none of the subdued emotion, essential to Holmes as a character. A pipe appears precisely three times, and a cigar if proffered but unsmoked. Jude Law's Watson shows little affection for or understanding of this nouveau Holmes, and their little bits of stage business evoke nothing of the vital feeling between them.That said, if a steam-punk action-adventure film that's built around three or four elaborate chase sequences appeals, this film may be a fun way to spent an afternoon -- it's certainly a decent ""popcorn"" flick. But anyone who knows anything about, or cares very much for, Conan Doyle's immortal character would be better off staying home and popping a few Jeremy Bretty DVD's into their player.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

great fun,"I'm not sure what I was expecting when I entered this film. In fact the only reason why I went to see it is mainly because of it's three killer leads. Safe to say that was reason enough. Although Guy Ritchie might not be the right director to bring this stylish and smart new franchise to it's full potential. The chemistry and style injected into the proceedings is enough to make for a wonderfully smart if at times too fast but entertaining update the classic source material. Robert Downey Jr is of course wonderful in the lead role of Sherlock Holmes. He portrays the character with a manic sensibility befitting a crazed genius with a genuinely strong physical side. He is equaled by Jude Law's brilliantly charismatic sidekick Watson who has just as much brain and braun as his counterparts but is equipped with a little less passion but a lot more common sense. They are joined by the likable Rachael McAdams in her first real meaty role since The Notebook. She stars as the love interest of Holmes a seductive, brilliant and courageous but sneaky thief. The film's only weakness is Ritchie's manic and chaotic direction which I liked more here than anyone of his films. But still the film would have benefited by having someone much more skilled behind the camera. A strong sense of cinematic artistry accompanies the film in it's set design, costumes and cinematography and it's just a really fun time.

What a piece of junk,"I am still reeling from the sheer terror of enduring this movie. It was a masterpiece of horror. It was a collection of platitudes and nonsense on a level that you rarely see in movies with this kind of budget. I can not find a single redeeming quality. Nothing at all.Bad acting is excusable here, and I won't cover the obvious stiffness and discomfort of Jude Law. I'd be too if I was him. That wasn't the bad part though.Holmes. Drug addict. Manic depressive perhaps. Prone to lock him self up in his room for weeks on end. Not good for the old physique. But oh, he's a veritable Bruce Lee meets the Karate Kid. Are you joking? Are you serious? I can suspend my disbelief with the best of them, but that is just too much of a stretch. It is actually too bloody stupid to even contemplate.For half the movie you think you are watching some kind of a ""Harry Potter has Grown Up"" production.

No, Harry Potter is not an improvement on the old Dickensian movie look. Really. It's not.Oh, and who let bloody Dan Brown into the script writers room. Honestly.

Just pretend it isn't what it is!,"I wanted to enjoy this movie. And I did most thoroughly. There wasn't a single part of it I could criticise. It just wasn't the film I wanted to see. In the UK, we've had it so good. Have you ever seen the beauty, charm and grace of The Dancing men with Brett as Holmes? Fantastic acting, sober and as real as one can imagine life was back in the nineteenth century. A perfect visual and auditory treat. That's what this version has to compete against. The problem is not that this is a bad film, but that it has to compete against years of what has been made before, and to which we are accustomed. Everything in this movie may be true to the books, but it isn't true in our heads, and that's where it counts. Guy has made a sharp and interesting film. The music was brilliant I thought.

They didn't quite get that right) but I really did enjoy it...just as long as I pretended that it wasn't a Sherlock Holmes film!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Sherlock Holmes,"ReviewIf you want to know what Guy Ritchie's ""Sherlock Holmes"" is like, imagine ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"" or ""Snatch"" and then put them in the late 1800s and add Sherlock Holmes. If you are imagining the most kinetic cinematic rendition of ""Sherlock Holmes"" ever, you're probably not far off the mark.Indeed, ""Sherlock Holmes"" doesn't relent too much. It keeps a rapid pace and doesn't quite care if you're not connecting the dots as quickly as Sherlock Holmes. Robert Downey Jr. plays Holmes with a sort of manic dishevelment. His own living quarters at 221B are a mess but his mind is forever organizing minute details and usually alienating a friend or two in the process.Watson (Jude Law) is an intelligent sidekick, always feeling obliged to lend a hand or a prognosis. Instead of the typically daft Watson of cinema history, Law plays Watson with a certain cunning and wry humor that a hero like Holmes desperately needs.The plot of the film seems half baked. It concerns an evil occult leader Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) who is hanged for murdering five women in a sacrificial ritual. When Blackwood mysteriously returns from the grave, Holmes is called in to investigate. As is typical in all mysteries, the villain gets away with a bunch of crimes is foiled before he can perpetrate the biggest crime he was intending to commit the whole time. Sorry if I gave away that this film ends with Holmes triumphant.The real strength of ""Sherlock Holmes"" is its look and energy. The sets are marvelously macabre and Ritchie does a good job synthesizing them with a CGI rendition of 1800s London. The cinematography is energetic but never confuses the action – I particularly enjoyed when Sherlock Holmes anticipates his next eight moves in a fight and then executes them with flawless precision. I also liked a scene in a butchery that served as a throwback to the old silent film cliché of a damsel in distress tied up and being conveyed towards a buzz saw.Rachel McAdams plays Ira Adler, the presumed love interest of Holmes but she seems more like an afterthought; her only real purpose in the film is to give precedent for a sequel. But in the end, if you can just sit back and relax, ""Sherlock Holmes"" is pure popcorn and you'll like it.Rating:On a scale of one to Casablanca this film is a ""Matrix Reloaded"" (2003).Rationalization:Don't enter this movie thinking that by its end you'll come out wiser, or better, or more thoughtful, or with your thoughts provoked. ""Sherlock Holmes"" is an action movie with a slight mystery at its center. There are some excellent sequences and great one-liners, but it never instills you with the same terror or wonder that you find in other mysteries like ""Rear Window"" (1954) or ""Se7en"" (1995) but it is way better than most action movies coming out today (i.e. ""G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra"" (2009))http://www.iamdatabasefilmjournal.blogspot.com/",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Sherlock deals with his personal life,"Literature's most famous detective returns to the silver screen in Guy Ritchie's adaptation. Robert Downey Jr. plays the title character, investigating the disappearance of a recently executed lord charged with practicing black magic. As always, Holmes collects the various evidence and carefully pieces it together to figure out what's going on.The major significance of this adaptation is its focus on Holmes's personal life. The guy has more than a few problems with which he has to deal in the process of solving the case. Also, the Order seemed like a Skull & Bones kind of society. The depiction of London is about what one would expect: muddy streets full of wealth and poverty, the scuzziest environment imaginable (could there be any other portrayal?). The perfect setting for the contrast of the good work done by Holmes and the evil concocted by the Order.So, even though I don't consider ""Sherlock Holmes"" a masterpiece, I really liked it. Downey, along with Jude Law and Rachel McAdams bring a lot of charm to this latter-day look at the character most associated with detective work. Certainly worth seeing.And that's not just elementary, my dear Watson.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Its elementary, my dear Wattson....","I have always been an avid Edgar Allen Poe/ Arthur Conan Doyle fan. There is something about the writing style in their books, i don't know what it is but i do really enjoy it. It may possibly be the main character explaining to the reader how all of the tiny clue left throughout the novel all contribute and build up to a logical explanation for the seemingly supernatural and impossible events detailed in the book, it could be the way that the protagonists can give a blow by blow account of past events or details in a crime scene that are seemingly meaningless. I do not know what it is but this film certainly incorporated it.I have seen a few reviews where people are whining that their beloved sherlock Holmes has been turned into a drug using, violent lout. Well unfortunately for them, he never was squeaky clean. He was always smoking opium in the books, with a fascination of martial arts and science.The film takes place in Victorian London, during the industrial period. The atmosphere created by Guy is incredible. Everything about the set and the cast made it feel like a portal back in time. Not a single detail was missed. Robert Downey Jr made a fantastic Sherlock Holmes, having researched the character and the period of time extremely thoroughly. This is not an easy character to portray well and without knowledge, would be impossible to create a sense of character from the script alone.The plot, although not a Sherlock Holmes story i know could have easily been one. It could have easily been a best-seller written by Arthur Conan Doyle himself.So, overall then, an excellent film with good action sequences, romance and some comic relief. Excellent costumes, set and atmosphere. Superb acting from all members of cast. I would highly recommend it although children may find it slightly hard to follow.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
I don't see what's so wrong about it,"Many of the critics hate this movie because they thought Guy Ritchie (or whoever the director is) had misinterpreted Sherlock Holmes terribly. They thought they've chosen the wrong cast, and hopefully no Sherlock Holmes 2.Well, I thought it was fine. That was Guy Ritchie's idea: to make a different interpretation of Sherlock Holmes instead of that old, deerstalker-capped detective, and tried to depict a more modern, more heroic type of Sherlock Holmes.The movie was very exciting, and all the action made me spill all my popcorn onto the theater floor, but who noticed.This is a must-see, only when you feel like the time to see some Sherlock",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Before Watching: Sherlock Holmes (2009),"""Sherlock Holmes"" (2009) is an intellectual mystery movie featuring a great deal of character through Downey Jr. and Law. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:The character known as Sherlock Holmes is perceived in pop culture as a charismatic investigator who with his almost-supernatural set of abilities can crack even the toughest murder mysteries. This movie follows suites and is filled to the brim with wit, charismatic glee, and the essential, almost stereotypical antagonists (which borderlines the Satanistic realms, so sensitive watchers to that are cautioned). Nevertheless, the dynamic relationship which Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law showcases glues the movie together and fill in the cracks excellently - save one point.The thrill of the movie, as well as the plot itself, hinges on the clues and details scattered throughout the runtime. They are obvious to recognize, but practically impossible to understand and put into context, save to Holmes. Where Sherlock Holmes could have its audience analyzing and pondering about the implication about the revealed objects, it instead saves the relevance until one big presentation after the climax, at which point the objects have lost a great deal of interest. This lack and use of information can lead some audiences to feeling alienated, uninterested and possibly frustrated, which is something to be cautioned about beforehand. As average entertainment, however, Sherlock Holmes does just fine.The music from Hans Zimmer deserves a mention for its creative use of contemporary instruments blended in a dissonance still harmonious. A unique piece for sure, and one of a few great things that still makes Sherlock Holmes a pleasant watching experience, which is even enhanced in the sequel.My personal grade: a frustrating but fun 6/10.

Sherlock Hates Irritating Theatrics,"Guy Ritchie's Recipe For One Terrible Movie: *Take perfect classic story, then knead it until mixed randomly *Add 3 heaping Tablespoons of good actors; peel off talent and discard *Mix in 3 tons of nasty dead pigs from ceiling *Sprinkle in a dash of bro-mance with zero chemistry every now and then *Put a lame ninja-like fight scene not related to the non-existent plot in with loud noises to wake audience up every 15 minutes *Throw in obvious set-ups for the upcoming sequel every three minutes to remind the audience that this won't be the last 2 hours and 8 minutes they will spend in a drooling plot less, senseless, endless comaGee, I can't wait for ""Sherlock Holme2"" (where the 's' in Holmes flips to a '2' shaped like a cheesy smoking CG pipe) to throw away another two hours of my life that I could spend on something more useful like painting my house with a Q-tip or reviewing a movie online (that I'd give a negative number rating were it possible!)For the half of you think this movie was the best thing since string cheese and are marking these low reviews as unhelpful, seek help.

Holmes like never before,I just finished watching Sherlock Holmes and I must admit that I got more than I bargained for. Guy's Ritchie's treatment of the legendary detective is very fresh and extremely entertaining. London's dirty streets in late 19th century have been captured almost to perfection. Robert Downing Jr. is THE Sherlock Holmes for the 21st century audiences. Sarcastic and witty this Holmes not only possesses a razor sharp brain but also terrific fighting skills! Definitely not what Arthur Conan Doyle had in mind but hey we've seen that Holmes a lot of times before. The plot is complex and intricate and the action sequences have been well choreographed to make a complete action thriller. Jude Law as Dr Watson has done a very good job where in his part has not been completely overshadowed by Holmes and in fact Holmes does rely upon him quite a bit. Go to this movie expecting an action thriller rather than a mystery.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Downey is smooth - fabric of tapestry weaved in this Baker Street epic is far from Irregular,"Although I have ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" on DVD I have never watched a full Guy Ritchie event until now... I plan to make up for lost time ASAP! I am familiar with his ironic method of sending up a person based on their own foibles - as he did in his BMW feature ""Star"" with then spouse Madonna. Clive Owen in that case was the Watson, while Madonna was Holmes on a bad day, or bad decade maybe...The ride was just as brisk in this totally original Sherlock Holmes venture, from when he plotted his pugilistic damage a la CSI or Sherlock/Downey Jr reverse engineering the solution to a felony in a manner reminiscent of the film based on a Philip K. Dick tale,""Paycheck."" There was a massive hue and cry against the production from the beginning, where is his Deerstalker hat? What? No Meerschaum pipe? Those were Basil Rathbone's, dearie, this Sherlock is way closer to what was in the original stories of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's interpretation of Dr George Bell, the real Sherlock Holmes.When noted Holmes fan club, Baker Street Irregulars - invitation only members, praised the film then this revelation tended to shut up most detractors.Robert Downey Jr (RDJ) as Holmes portrayed all of Holmes' eccentricities to perfection, he's even better here than in Iron Man. While Jude Law as a smart, efficient Dr Watson, the ex-soldier and capable of his own deductions was a marvelous foil to Holmes' self-worship! Mark Strong as the demonic Blackwood was a great villain, he already had his chops blooded in such a capacity as 'Septimus' in the cinematic version of Neil Gaiman's ""Stardust"" and he easily could play a member of the Malfoys in Harry Potter! Eddie Marsan shows versatility from an American accented would-be bank robber in ""Hancock"" to the Cockney-slurred Inspector Lestrade who obviously had a love-hate admiration for the eternal detective.Rachel McAdams as Sherlock's love-interest is a far cry from her usual sappy flicks such as ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" with Eric Bana or in the tear-jerker ""The Notebook"" which featured James Garner.Guy Ritchie's direction while at a blistering pace, never left you wondering if you missed anything nor did it speed by so fast you did not feel a part of the ride. Details on details, yet grittiness and sepia tones appeared not only appropriate but to highlight rather than detract from the overall presentation... Is it worth the price of admission?

"Authentic Holmes, At Last!","EXPERIENCE THE REAL SHERLOCK HOLMES This is the authentic Sherlock Holmes, not the antiseptic version played by Basil Rathbone or Jeremy Bretts. The Robert Downey Jr. Holmes is closer to the Holmes created by Sir Arther Conan Doyle than any other portrayal I have seen. Holmes was a mess. An addict of many things and almost uncivilized. Holmes was also brilliant and expert in many things which this movie shows when no other have. As most genius characters, he did not fit in his world or his world's expectation of proper behavior.In this film, Guy Ritchie has left his marks, for certain and one of his marks is to portray life as it was or is in any period his characters are set. London itself was a filthy dirty city during that period. Good personal hygiene was pretty much found only among the upper class. So the setting is authentic as is the character. For those who have trouble understanding the story, or finding the mystery to be solved, that is, in itself authentic to the books. Frequently Holmes is solving a different mystery than the readers (and in this case the viewers) are led to believe. Twists and turn-abouts abound, authentic to a Doyle plot. In the end...well in then end I will not spoil it, but will strongly recommend this movie as the best Sherlock Holmes I have seen to date. If you want to experience the authentic Holmes - a genius misfit, then see this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
The Adventure of the Ritchie deduction,"Ritchie's latest marked a return to the cinemas for me after a gap of three months, longer than any gap I recall. As a result, I'm inclined to look at the nicer aspects of this flick. And there are many if one can discern the intent behind the making of Sherlock Holmes. For starters, it's Guy Ritchie. A O Scott's (of NYT) observation is bang on - his approach to films is ""to make cool movies about cool guys with cool stuff"". Also, he seems to have a hold over London's sub-culture. Snatch and Lock Stock ... aren't cult films for nothing. They are intended to be precisely that. In his gravitating towards Holmes, I sense primarily an opportunity to milk the considerable London ethos that pervades throughout Doyle's work. Permit the brief digression but this is crucial to Holmes' (still unquestioned) exalted position in detective fiction. Poirot and his like do not preside over a criminal setting anywhere near as compelling. Only Maigret's Paris (grossly overused) comes remotely close. London represents a veritable treasure-trove of literary and cinematic possibilities and Ritchie makes considerable use of the latter. From Piccadilly Circus to the Tower of London, landmarks abound. It was particularly gratifying to watch sequences that weave their way through the alleys and lanes - most distinctive of London, and Holmes.There's a cue for the viewer in the manner in which Ritchie goes about extracting the maximum from London. He does the same with every aspect of the film from the performances to the plot. In short, every ounce of cinematic potential has been squeezed from the material. So Holmes' modest claims to an understanding of Bartitsu are developed into full- blown martial arts exploits. Watson is hinted as being a bit of a ladies' man in the books and voilà, Jude Law (competent) is cast, albeit with the necessary changes to his exterior. Far from being a mere accompaniment, Watson is very nearly indispensable to Holmes. Likewise, Lestrade is a nincompoop and Mrs Hudson in addition to being a super- efficient housekeeper, is also frankly expressive of her disbelief at Holmes' antics (""Some folk might say there was madness in his method""). Irene Adler and Sherlock Holmes have a fling (the limitless possibilities of 'To Sherlock Holmes, she is always the woman' !). Only here they make the one patent mistake of the movie. A femme fatale and a thief acting under Moriarty's orders is stretching it a bit and Rachel McAdams doesn't help either. The less said about the disservice done to Mark Strong in terms of character scripting the better.Ultimately, the flick is probably meant to be seen as a caper and plays out as one. Ritchie (like many others) probably wants to do a Bond movie. So he's indulged himself here with many elements that are a mark of that franchise. About Robert Downey Jr. then. His turn here is in keeping with all the above. The rapport he establishes with Law is the pillar of the film and is testimony to the skill of the actors. No matter how askew his take on a trait of the ace detective, the performance never loses credibility and most importantly, isn't an all- revealing act. It feels as if he has restrained himself and that leaves him with a lot in terms of options to exercise in the forthcoming films. I think he can build upon this if the possibility of a series were to emerge (as such a second is a given).And do remain seated for the exquisitely well crafted credits.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Amazing!!!! ...and actually quite loyal to the books...,"People who complain about this film tend to be people who just don't get Sherlock Holmes at all or stuffy Sherlock Holmes fans who believe they have managed to figure out the character in all entirety and that no one can defy them that.Well I found this film extremely exciting. The direction was very good and the fight scenes well placed and humorous. Also I thought Hans Zimmer's' soundtrack could not have been improved because it was absolutely superb. Not only all this but as a big plus it had amazing special effects.As soon as I had seen the film and had been transported back to my childhood by this excitingly fast paced movie, I sat down to reading The Return of Sherlock Holmes. The books I had to say surprised me, for of the little criticism I had read of the film it was doubts on how correct the attitudes were to the books. Now taking that into consideration I expected to begin reading a very dull long story about a righteous, stroppy gentleman, which was the image the criticises had given me. However I found Sherlock Holmes to be very much more like Robert Downey Jr's performance (which was amazing by the way), he was quick witted funny and always having little banters with Watson, teasing him.So Robert Downey Jr I believe really brought out the true Holmes. Also Jude Laws performance defo improved Watson by giving him more backbone, brains and making him all together a lot less worshipping of Holmes, which was obviously a good thing. Rachel McAdams played a very good Irene Adler.:D",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Sherlock Holmes movies are back from the dead,"Speculation and debate around the 2009 film version of Sherlock Holmes (a simple title used for countless movies based on Arthur Conan Doyle's detective) centered on the controversial choice of Robert Downey Junior, and the genre-shock-inducing decision to make Holmes, in effect, into an action hero. Happily neither of these choices turns out badly. Holmes was rather a man of action, though not to the same extent, in Conan Doyle's stories, and this element, in tandem with his well-known mastery of disguise, make for a logical, interesting, broadening element to his character. Best about this, though, is that the action scenes, which are well realized and entertaining without detracting from the story or going on too long, afford through creative means an original way into Holmes's character in early scenes. In a couple of the fight sequences we experience action first slowed down - before a repeat in normal speed -- in which we hear Holmes' telegraphic internal monologue as he uses his powers of observation and deduction to determine exactly how to defeat his opponent.Downey is extraordinary as Holmes. His performance has an intensity that makes it almost impossible to take one's eyes away from what he is doing. Holmes here is aloof and superior not out of intentional rudeness but the mere fact that he is operating on a level so much higher than everyone else intellectually that he cannot be bothered even to consider such things as politeness, tidiness, and grooming. At the same time he has moments of complete vulnerability that make for a fascinating and nuanced character. He's extremely obsessive, to the point of being almost unable to function, and in constant conflict with Jude Law's well-played and rather strung-out Dr. Watson. This conflict is well and subtly written, so that even while in some scenes it is only hinted it, it becomes the real centre of the film. It's good, strong drama, helped by a script full of well-written and witty dialogue. We can believe that the two men are not speaking, yet would easily die for each other, which is a difficult picture to paint on film. Rachel McAdams is magnetic as Irene Adler, whose character is rewritten from Doyle to further stretch the Holmes persona in fascinating ways.In fact, almost every element of this film is extremely well realized -- which brings me to the one that I think isn't. Of all things, the plot seemed entirely unsatisfactory. For much of the film, this is not a problem since for long stretches this story about the greatest mystery character of all is not a mystery at all but lavish character drama around the new feud between Holmes and Watson. When the plot does come in, it turns out to be in several over the scenes revolving around sketchy plot that involves a Lord coming back to life through black magic to gain godlike powers and lead an international conspiracy. It's flimsy and seems silly, and only leads up to the resolution that Holmes very quickly explains how all the instances of supernatural powers, totally unbeknown to even the most observant audience member, could have been simulated through natural means. The only reason the flop of a plot can be forgiven is that the drama between Holmes and Watson can be followed instead, and the rest of the production, from music to special effects and action sequences, to the stylized design of the extra-grimy Victorian London, are so unified and exceptional.There are strong hints (or bids) at a sequel involving Professor Moriarty; I think that development would be welcome.So the main failing of this movie is what is typically expected from a Sherlock Holmes story -- the mystery plot. But for character conflict, excellent acting, the fun of some thrilling action in a lushly-designed Victorian-style setting and an extremely memorable visual production, it's wonderful. On those terms, I'd highly recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Sherlock Holmes as a comics hero,"It was said that Guy Ritchie's version of Sherlock Holmes would make Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Sherlock Holmes turn in their graves. I believe this statement to be true to the extent that the latest had a grave.Yes, this version of Sherlock Holmes - which I hear will be soon followed by a sequel - is much more 21st century entertainment. It resembles much more some of the latest and more successful entries in the genre like V for Vendetta or The Dark Knight than 19th century detective stories. It is dark and violent and has political connotations that speak only to these who lived through the 20th century history. It's the kind of entertainment which you watch first to relax (if you like the genre) but yet you do not end viewing it with the feeling that you watched a completely brainless piece of garbage.Much of the quality of Guy Ritchie's version lies in the tormented version of the principal character that is being created by Robert Downing Jr. The rational detective from Baker Street is a man of all sins who is capable not only of reasoning but also of fighting and surviving in a brutal world, as well of feeling deeply for a cared one who betrays him not only once. Then we have a vision of London as a 19th century Cour des Miracles which is rendered in a strikingly poignant manner as a stage of all possibilities becoming true provided they they rely on 19th century most advanced science. I liked this vision and for once the perspective of the sequel does not make me uncomfortable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Sherlock gets re-imaged for the MTV generation.,"You know, come the finale of Guy Ritchie's ""update"" of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's much loved super sleuth I was not only bored to almost impending sleep, but also struck with one overriding question; why not just make a Victorian piece about a couple of swanky buddy sleuths and leave out the name Sherlock Holmes? The answer of course is obvious, to me at least, it's a name that sells. Mr Ritchie would most likely tell us that he wanted to bring the great detective to the attention of a whole new generation, whilst simultaneously making it appealing to the ""youth"" of today. Not elementary my dear Mr Ritchie, it's a cash in if you please. A cash in further aided by the casting of the talented and in vogue Robert Downey Jr as Holmes. Whilst casting Jude Law as Watson {so effectively a secondary role that suits Law perfectly} also carries some aesthetic weight for a younger audience.The film does pretty much what one expects of a family blockbuster, in short, simple frothy fun that's sadly devoid of any mystery or intelligence befitting the once Deerstalker attired one. There's action and explosions, even good old fist fights given the Ritchie slow-mo make over, but these are either preceded or followed by long bouts of tedium. Not helped by an unadventurous & dull plot involving Mark Strong's {value for money performance} black magic shenanigans as Lord Blackwood, and the pointless inclusion of the anonymous Rachel McAdams as Holmes' ex love interest Irene Adler. All of which comes together for a rather uninspiring show down on a half built Tower Bridge. The set design is smart and on the money (Sarah Greenwood), as are the costumes (Jenny Beavan), but the same can't be said for the sound mix, which is quite frankly skewy and renders some of Downey Jr's brainy ramblings inaudible. Same for the score, Hans Zimmer goes for bombastic, which would have worked if it wasn't in conjunction with diddly day-diddly doo Celtic music. I mean this is Victorian England right? You could have set the film somewhere Celtic Mr Ritchie-since you have changed most of the essence of the character anyway. Hmm.The sequel is inevitable given that the film has made monster amounts of cash, and no doubt about it, Law & Downey Jr have great chemistry. But this is comic book Sherlock, an attempt at an action comedy mixing brains with brawn. The end result being almost a cure for insomnia. 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Clever, Fun, and Very Entertaining","Sherlock Holmes is one of the most iconic fictitious characters of all time. Created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in the late 1800's, Holmes is an incredible detective who is able to solve a case out of the mundane details in life that nobody else seems to be able to notice. However, prior to this movie, I was not very well-educated on the character. So, I went in with a fresh, open opinion and was very pleased with what I saw. This tells the story of a man named Lord Blackwood, who is supposedly involved in black magic. He is caught by Holmes and his partner, John Watson, early on and is sentenced to death. However, Blackwood is resurrected, and Holmes needs to solve the case. I wasn't so keen on the black magic elements of the story, but when the explanation came at the end, I was really pleased. It made me really appreciate the rest of the film a lot more. I liked the characterization of Holmes, and the mannerisms given to him by the fantastic Robert Downey, Jr. Downey plays Holmes perfectly, getting every little quirk the character has exactly right. There were a number of small things in this movie that I absolutely loved, like the little banter between Holmes and Watson, Holmes and the Inspector. However, what is quite possibly the best thing in this movie is the scenes where Holmes is shown sitting there, but you can hear all the other conversations and noises around him. That is really what defines his character, displaying his brilliance perfectly. There were some problems I had though. The film does run a bit long, and there are a number of scenes that could have been trimmed. The ending is also a big problem. It ends on a cliffhanger, and while I don't mind, I wish they would have saved the cliffhanger stuff for later installments. But, despite that, I really liked Sherlock Holmes, and am looking forward to further installments in this series.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Well Done.,As a Holmes fan for over 50 years I had no idea what to expect here. In my opinion the PBS series with Jeremy Brett was the pinnacle of the many interpretations of Holmes and would never be surpassed.......This movie did not surpass that PBS series. However I loved the movie. The only way you could do Holmes after the Brett series and make him interesting was to come up with a completely different way of looking at Holmes. Guy Ritchie did this beyond all expectations. Downey and Law were superb the movie had great atmosphere and the plot was over the top.... I am looking forward to the sequels.........Like Bond after Connery Holmes lives on after Brett.,,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Absolutely Thrilling Start to end and quite unlike your Dad's Sherlock Holmes,"Although some might disagree, I believe that this adaptation of Sherlock Holmes is truer to the original than any of its predecessors. Downey's character seems to stand out quite well without being overshadowed by Jude Law who also played an excellent Watson. There was more action in this one that in previous version of the franchise, but I think that it was aptly suited for this day and age, where anything short of that might end up as a BBC miniseries. Overall its was fun, exciting from start to finish, had fair acting. I wish it could have lasted a bit longer and I sure hope, there is a sequel with the infamous Professor Moriaty. Overall good family film for all the ages. If you liked the Young Sherlock Holmes in the 80's, you will like this too.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
very good,"This movie really was awesome, RDJ did great as Holmes. Though sometimes I had trouble understanding RDJ's fake English accent, which made it hard for me to follow the plot during certain scenes (probably will be fixed after a re-watch). I really enjoyed Jude Law as Watson as well, in many ways I think he was actually much more entertaining to watch in the film than Holmes (sorry RDJ :)). The only real issue I have with this film is Irene Addler. I'm sorry but I just did not like her at all, part of it was her voice I just found it extremely annoying. Maybe I'll warm up more to Rachel's portrayal by the second movie which I cannot wait to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

I never thought i'd like a movie by Guy Ritchie this much, but this one is SUPERB in every way! Robert Downey's amazing performance makes him my Best Actor of 2009, and Jude Law's Dr Watson is most endearing. Mark Strong gives us a wonderfully diabolical villain that makes Avatar's Col Quaritch merely cartoony. The script is also very witty and the plot believable, two essential qualities if a Sherlock Holmes movie is to be credible. There is much wit to be found in the music score as well.

The Vidiot Reviews...,"Sherlock HolmesIn this day and age, the only prerequisites needed to be a police detective is a badge, a gun, an ulcer, a bitch of an ex-wife, and one helluva drinking problem.In 1891, however, detectives, like the one featured in this mystery, needed to be astute, refined and have one helluva cocaine addiction.After foiling Lord Blackwell's human sacrifice, detective Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) and his assistant Dr. Watson (Jude Law) descend further into the quagmire of black magic when the recently executed Blackwell rises from the grave. What's more, Holmes must contend with the return of his ex-girlfriend (Rachel McAdams), a master thief in the service of a shadowy mastermind.Directed by Guy Ritchie, Sherlock Holmes is a rollicking revision of the scholarly sleuth which uses kinetic camera work and cocky actors to coax out the characters lesser-known qualities. Hip and contemporary, with a solid footing in Arthur Conan Doyle lore, Sherlock Holmes will please both newcomers and diehards alike.And while they may seem like they are more than just friends, I assure you, the partnership between Holmes and Watson is as innocent as that of Batman and Robin's, R2-D2 and C3PO's, or Siegfried and Roy's.

Guy Ritchie's Masterpiece-Can't Wait For The Sequel,"We saw ""Sherlock Holmes"" on Christmas Day with a packed audience. Judging by my reaction and those in the theatre, everyone LOVED it! I was on the edge of my seat during the entire fast-paced and action packed movie. Unlike other reviews, I was surprisingly able to hear and understand the quick dialogue and English humor. I don't think I missed anything. I encourage anyone reading this to go see the movie and don't wait for it to come out on DVD. It is definitely one you want to see on the big screen. I loved the music too. Couldn't wait to rush home and order the soundtrack off Amazon.com. Great movie Guy Ritchie. Well Done!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
The great game,"Guy Ritchie after a spell in the doldrums returned with a big budget production of Sherlock Holmes with a rejuvenated Robert Downey Jr as Sherlock Holmes and Jude Law playing a more brutish Dr Watson.The villain here is aristocratic Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) who has been foiled when partaking in a ritual sacrifice and despite being hung for his crimes, seemingly returns from the dead and kills others by use of black magic it seems as he aims to topple the British establishment.Irene Adler turns up in the shape of Rachel McAdams with a hint of romance with Holmes and there are plenty of hints that Professor Moriarty is lurking in the background.Guy Ritchie has gone for a grimy, steam-punk setting of London. There is plenty of CGI the more effective being the partially built Tower of London but the CGI looks just that and has aged badly even though the film was only released in 2009.Ritchie still sticks with his London setting of cockney schemers and wheeler dealers. Its a muscular film with slow motion fight scenes as Holmes anticipates the combat in advance. His Watson is also handy with his fists, you actually wonder if he is a pugilist rather than a doctor. I did find the sub plot of Holmes being put out that Watson is engaged to get married rather irritating and not funny at all.Still Downey is enjoying himself and gets to try out his English accent again after Chaplin ad Richard III. This is a muscular action adventure film, less of a mystery as the plot places an emphasis on the supernatural and some of Holmes famous deductions are actually laughable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Its pretty damn good!!!!!!,I agree that Ritchie and his team of writers have taken a lot of liberties in this movie but i think thats good or else it would have turned into the same costume dramas of yore. Ritchie's brought in his unique Tarantino like style and feel to this movie about a character that has had umpteen interpretations since the dawn of the age of cinema. Its fresh (even though it has a feel of 'Snatch') and in a lot of ways very interesting as the story tries to catch the essence of Conan Doyle with modern Thomas Harris like leanings. I would be very much interested in a sequel and i would also be interested as to who might be cast as professor Moriarty (Tom Wilkinson/Gary Oldman comes to mind)...Kudos to Ritchie. The divorce didn't dampen his creative juices.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Bloody Brilliant!,"""Sherlock Holmes"" is part-comedy, part-thriller, part-romance, and part-buddy movie. It is also completely brilliant.The film's plot concerns a mysterious plot by the menacing Lord Blackwood. Holmes (Downey Jr.), Watson (Law), and an alluring past love interest (McAdams) must work together- sometimes reluctantly- to crack the case. It sounds simple, but a number of ominous supporting players and adrenaline-inspiring set pieces make it constantly entertaining and riveting.The perpetually likable Robert Downey Jr. takes up the torch as Sherlock Holmes. There's no need to compare his work to that of Basil Rathbone- the two performances could not be more different. Downey Jr. makes Holmes both comedic and competent. His accent is convincing, and his delivery is as dead-pan as ever. In Guy Ritchie's revisionist take, Holmes has become a comic action hero, and Downey Jr. pulls off both the comedy and the action seamlessly. Jude Law lends great support as Watson; his take on the character is more traditional, but he makes a great comedic straight-man as well. McAdams also does well as an American femme fatale whose allegiances are always in question.Stylistically, the film combines Ritchie's ""guns-blazing"" sensibilities with period detail and witty dialogue. The quick-cut shots and fast-paced visual flashbacks/explanations suit the source material surprisingly well. The musical score is effectively creepy; it evokes the air of the Rathbone films and the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle novels. Similarly, the costumes and art direction capture the time period, and arrest the audience visually. The script is chock-full of funny lines, and the cast delivers them well.While purists may shudder at the sight of Sherlock in the boxing arena, Ritchie's ""Holmes"" is fun, fast-paced, and fresh. Case closed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
A blockbuster (with the weaknesses that that brings) but entertaining and fun with good work by Downey and Law,"Having themselves witnessed the hanging and burial of murder and self-styled ""master of the occult"" Lord Blackwood, Holmes and Watson can close another case – perhaps their last since Watson is planning to settle into marriage. However, a ruptured tomb and a missing corpse suggest that there may be something to Blackwood's threat to Holmes to return from beyond the grave and commit further crimes. With London in the grip of a panic over the supposed resurrection of Blackwood, Holmes and Watson attempt to solve the mystery even as the stakes are escalating.The news that Mockney king Guy Ritchie was working on a new film of Sherlock Holmes was greeted by many (including myself) with trepidation at best and outright horror at worst. The inability of Ritchie to break away from the clichés and rather tired genre that he himself helped create led me to assume that he would simply be doing another version of his one trick but with a character probably called Sherlock ""Sleuther"" Holmes in it. Although there is an element of Ritchie doing his usual stuff, this didn't turn out to be the case because the film is all rather entertaining and makes for an enjoyable winter blockbuster – perhaps not impressive enough to slug it out in the summer season, but certainly good enough to be in cinemas now. It must be said that some will have an issue with Holmes as a bare-knuckle fighter and other such ""updates"" but my attitude is that the Rathbone/Bruce films from the 1940's were not the most faithful either and put entertainment as their focus – to the point that Holmes was moved forward in time to join the war effort against the Nazis for several films.So the question is whether or not this new Holmes film is entertaining or not and whether or not the many liberties taken will annoy the casual viewer or not. The answer can be found by watching the film because mostly it is very easy to enjoy as a blockbuster film. The plot has weaker moments but is mostly good enough to keep things moving and, while it does rely on special effects and convenience at times, it does have sufficient meat (or at least appearance of meat) to make you feel like there is some logical substance to it. Of course the plot produces a lot of action, which is mostly reasonably good but is certainly not as exciting as it could have been. The editing is part of the problem as it employs a blurry style that seems to detract more than it adds. The use of CGI as well is best described as ""solid"" because while not bad, it is not as seamless or as well-used as one would have hoped. While mentioning the visuals I will add that, while it may have just been a poor projection in my screening, the whole film seemed poorly lit – I'm fine with a Gothic dimness, but this was murky across the board and just made it harder to watch rather than adding atmosphere.Ritchie's direction is solid as well. He produces some of his usual tricks but I did like his use of slow-motion at key moments, not because it made those moments more exciting (it didn't – indeed it makes it a bit less so), but rather because it is different and does give the film a feel that makes it stand out a little from the other blockbusters that would do everything as fast and as noisy as possible. The main selling point of the film is not all this though, but rather the main thing that makes it fun – which is the good work of the cast. Downey is surprisingly good as Holmes – a fun character with a playful logic but also selfish and perhaps self-destructive streak. Likewise Law plays his Watson well, perhaps not bringing a lot to the character but allowing for the relationship between the two to be part of the film. Strong is a good villain of the piece, while Marsan does a typically ""two steps behind"" Lestrade. McAdams is good but it must be said that I did get the feel that most of her performance was about how good-looking she is rather than her abilities as an actress – it works though.The decision to leave Moriarty as character in the background is a good one because it gives the sequel(s) a strong card to play – and one that I would return to watch. Ritchie's Holmes is not without weaknesses but it is solid enough to entertain, thanks mostly to the good turns from Downey and Law (individually and together) adding to the sense of fun that the film has.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Elementary with Downey,"In Sherlock Holmes as of 2009, under direction by Guy Ritchie, Sherlock is introduced using all his deductive skills to properly figure out how to kick a guy's ass in a matter of seconds and then proceeding to do it. For the rest of the film, Holmes is running about slightly neurotic with no sense of personal hygiene or taste. Yeah, exactly, he's played by Robert Downey Jr, you got it. Apparently there's two ways you can look at this and as far as I understand they are both valid - Robert Downey Jr is doing Sherlock Holmes more in the line of what the original Conan Doyle creation was. At the same time, Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes are two steps away from joining the X-Men or the Fantastic Four. Makes sense too, I guess. It's the ""contemporary"" approach.All in all though, this cartoon version of Doyle's Sherlock is a lot of fun. Amusement is the key word, and the big reason is Robert Downey Jr who lifts the entire film up and carries it in his arms from the very beginning to the very end. No, make that to the very ""to be continued"" (it's ""contemporary""). Not even Jude Law playing doctor Watson can do as much for the film as he does. The story - concerning the mysterious case of the gallow-dangling Lord Blackwood who apparently is coming back from the dead for a dastardly plot against the kingdom - only works because Downey Jr says it's worth following. The clues and the plot turns are only interesting because they happen to him. His fighting at the 19th century Fight Club and the 60's Batman style fight sequences only works because he's doing it and we only buy his deductive brilliance because he seems to believe in it himself. Even his love interest, the quite weak Rachel McAdams, works solely for the reason that he seems to be madly and problematically in love with her. In fact, toward the end when we are tempted with a sequel featuring Holmes' arch nemesis himself, I wanted to see the sequel just because Robert Downey Jr would do this one more time!The only qualitative thing that Robert Downey Jr isn't responsible of, the film leaves to Jude Law and the sub-plot concerning his Watson getting married to some woman and Holmes being jealous over it. Holmes and Watson, arguably the biggest closet couple in the history of literature, are basically a real dynamic duo here, and it's interesting how the movie doesn't make any effort in denying their relationship. Nothing specific occurs and at the same time, there are no clever jokes or hints to the audience. It's just there, which is both a surprise and a bit of a progressive move. By simply assuming their relation to begin with, nothing more needs to be said and the MPAA can rate it PG-13 for some violence and ""suggestive material"".It's easy to understand how old Holmes afficinados might treat this Sherlock Holmes with absinthe and a sad fiddle. But to be fair, it could have been so much worse and it's probably the most refreshing film Guy Ritchie has made in years. It's Sherlock Holmes with a bag of popcorn. All elementary, in it's own way.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
The most brilliant mind,"Let me make my voting clear! I refuse to give this a 10, because I am no movie expert and in no position of calling this an excellent movie! As for the movie, it is the most entertaining movie of 2009! The plot is just brilliant and there are very few plot holes as the movie continues. The movie also develops nicely, sharing the adventure with the audience. The ending is somewhat predictable and there are a few clichés, but in no point during the running time, they will ruin the experience! The visual and sound effects are very well done. There are spectacular views and breath taking sound effects. Definitely not a low budget movie this...The acting is very good. Natural, funny and adventurous. Chemistry between Robert Jr and Jude Law is one of a kind. I have no complaints about the cast. Even the bad guys were well-casted! The boxing scenes remind me of the ones in Snatch, definitely a Guy signature.Movie is highly recommended, money well spent!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

Basil Rathbone must be turning in his grave,"It's elementary Guy - keep it simple and develop your characters with a plot that people can relate to.I am trying to think where this film went wrong and I have reached the conclusion that it was just about everywhere.What the hell Jude Law was doing in this load of tripe I will never know but you could say that his talent was completely wasted in endless predictable action and fight scenes.If there was ever a one joke or one theme movie this was it. My God, didya ever guess that Sherlock Holmes has an amazing power of deduction? If you didn't, Guy Ritchie demonstrated this to us five hundred and ninety five times.And Guy if you cannot come up with a feasible plot and have to ham it up - it HAS to be funny. And your villains HAVE to make you scared. My 8-yr-old grand-daughter was more frightened of Mrs Tweedy in Chicken Run than she was by Lord Blackwood in over-baked pad of codswallop.I can only say that Basil Rathbone must be turning in his grave.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
A brilliant film!  What are the critics complaining about?,"When we first saw the trailer to Sherlock Holmes, my wife and I both got the impression that this film could be really good or really bad. Then when the reviews came out, I breathed a sigh of relief that we hadn't wasted our time and money running out to see it on opening night. We would have avoided it entirely if she hadn't suggested we go see some chick flick, causing me to grasp at ""that silly Sherlock Holmes action film"" as an escape hatch.Now we are both furious at the critics for keeping us away from this film for so long. Robert Downey's Sherlock Holmes is the most compelling and authentic portrayal of the Holmes character I've ever seen. One of the first things we find out about Holmes in the Conan Doyle stories is that he's a manic depressive drug addict who engages in aberrant, self-destructive behavior like firing bullets into the walls of his apartment when he doesn't have a case to distract him from his inner demons. All Guy Ritchie does is emphasize this darker side of Holmes' character and use it to portray Holmes as a man of action as well as creature of the mind. That is a far cry from the wholesale reworking of Holmes that the critics accuse Ritchie of.Ritchie's Holmes is a lonely misfit who lives with one foot in ""respectable"" society and the other in London's vast underworld. All of that is true to the stories. As for Watson, he is Holmes' only friend and the one person trying to save him from himself (again, true to the stories). For that reason, Watson's impending marriage is a threat to Holmes, and brings out some wonderful comic relief with Holmes acting the part of the aggrieved ""wife"" trying to overlook ""her"" husband's dalliances while working hard to undermine them and save the ""marriage."" That may go beyond what's in the stories, but it's a great way to make the two characters come alive in a way that a 21st Century audience can relate to. Failure to re-imagine their relationship in such a way runs the risk of treating Holmes and Watson as Victorian museum pieces; something that's been done quite enough.Throw into the mix a supernatural plot with a villain in the mold of Aleister Crowley, and you have a superb film that shakes off the dust of 20th Century screen adaptations and gives us a fresh new Holmes for the 21st Century who is still 100% faithful to the character. I hope to see Downey and Law in many Holmes sequels to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
One of the best movies of 2009,"We had noisy and explosive blockbusters in summer etc.Transformers 2, G.I Joe. While they were entertaining, they were just into the action with simple story and some lame jokes. So now comes December, other than Avatar, another so-called blockbuster is Sherlock Holmes. Sherlock Holmes is a reboot by Guy Ritchie which shows the younger Sherlock and his partner, Waston. Whether it is a true reboot, I don't know as I am not familiarise with the original. But this reboot will definitely get some new fans.The story: It has a good mix of genres, action and thriller/suspense and mystery with a touch of humour. In the end, Guy manages to blend them together and forms an entertaining, thrilling and good movie. Sherlock does action, he does boxing and he seems not to be afraid of pain. Not only he knows perfect action, he also can visualise. That is what makes him so deadly. Other than that, his mind is smart and can observe background fast and still manage to say quirky humorous jokes. Robert Downey Jr is good for that Sherlock. Han Zimmer also does a perfect job in creating the electrifying music.Overall: It is worth a watch. Even if you don't know who is Sherlock Holmes, it is still good to watch this and who knows, you may even become a fan of him. It is a good blockbuster as the summer has noisy and non-sense blockbusters, this actually has a plot with twists and at the same time packed with action and thrills.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Style over substance, very disappointing","Despite being a well known pop culture figure, I had little to no contact to Sherlock Holmes until today. I never read the stories or watched the films and mini series. I knew, of course who he was and a little bit about Watson as well because, well, their reputation proceeds them. Sherlock Holmes is so popular that the Guinness World Records has consistently listed him as the ""most portrayed movie character"" with 75 actors playing the part in over 211 films. An update of this classic tale sounded like a great idea. Unfortunately, Guy Ritchie's adaption is rather disappointing. The story begins with Sherlock Holmes and his assistant Dr. Watson finally catching serial killer and occult ""sorcerer"" Lord Blackwood. He gets the death penalty. But Blackwood mysteriously returns from the grave and resumes his killing spree. Holmes, then reopens the case and tries to unravel the clues to this mystery... Ritchie's rendition of Sherlocke Holmes is somewhat engaging and entertaining but it also has the typical flaws of a blockbuster. First thing you'll notice in the film is the weird camera angles, and the freeze-frame edits. It's Richie's trademark and he seems to love it because he does this in all of his works. Visually, it's definitely a stylish film but sometimes Richie goes a bit over the top creating certain situations with little or no relevance to the plot just to show his skills, like the bare-knuckle boxing sequences. The script is a mess; it's all over the place, lacks focus and the plot twist, if you can call it that, is nothing more than a setup for the inevitable sequel. Honestly, the big mystery is not that interesting, captivating or well written for that matter. The strength of the film lies in the performances of the lead actors even though, I've seen them doing much, much better. Robert Downey Jr was very charismatic as always but he was clearly out of his element. Jude Law did fine but I almost feel he's too good of an actor to play such a small, underdeveloped character; and Rachel McAdams, was energetic and vibrant as usual. I have to say that I'm not a big fan of Ritchie. And this film didn't change my opinion one bit. His approach to film-making is much more style than substance and this film is the clear evidence of that. Those expecting something clever and well thought will be disappointed.5/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Downey and Ritchie Successfully Make the Cerebral Victorian Detective into an Action Hero,"SHERLOCK HOLMES: Holmes' famous catch phrase ""the Game is Afoot"" should be replaced by Full-Speed-Ahead in this kinetic adventure film, directed by Guy Ritchie. The cerebral Victorian detective has been transformed by Ritchie into a thrill-seeking action hero. Whereas the literary Holmes, created by Arthur Conan Doyle, would seek solace from boredom between cases by indulging in narcotics, this new Holmes is equally likely to seek out an underground fight club as he is a crack pipe.That's not to say that this new Holmes (Played by the always watchable Robert Downey Jr.) is lacking in intellect. We naturally get the requisite astute deductions based on trivialities invisible to anyone else. However, this modern Holmes has a Fools-Rush-In-Where-Wise-Men-fear-To-Tread mentality. He rarely thinks things through until after he's waded hip deep into danger and mayhem. It's only when he's face-to-face with impending disaster that his magnificent mind kicks into action and starts plotting his strategy. For instance, when Holmes is going toe-to-toe with an opponent in fisticuffs, his great brain begins to pre-choreograph the battle. We see inside Holmes' mind as he anticipates every blow, lists his enemy's weak spots, calculates how long it will take for the bad guy to fall and how long it will take him to get up again. As soon as he's satisfied with his pre-fight prediction, we see Holmes leap physically into the fray, which invariably ends just as Holmes anticipated.It's as if this version of Holmes needs to be under pressure in order to motivate his amazing deductions. He seems to be more in love with danger than with solving puzzles, as the classic Holes was. Downey's Holmes is much more of a warrior than earlier versions of Holmes. He's not the type to sit in his room, smoking his pipe until an epiphany hits him. This Holmes has danger as his muse. It's hard to imagine Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce (Who starred in the most popular classic film versions of Holmes and Watson) storming into a room full of armed thugs, carrying nothing but a walking stick and some Nun-chucks, and besting the baddies in a wild brawl.And speaking of Watson, Jude Law makes a very dapper Doctor John Watson, and plays off well against Downey's quirky Holmes. Watson is engaged to be married to Mary Morstan (We don't know where Watson met Mary, since Holmes is only introduced to her after Watson has decided to marry her. Watson clearly didn't meet her in Holmes' case ""The Sign of Four"", as Doyle wrote her) who has a very unpleasant introduction to Holmes. Holmes is clearly threatened by Mary's relationship with Watson and does his best to sabotage it. (The scene where he uses a fake psychic to predict that Mary will become fat and grow warts is very funny). There is a subtle homo-erotic aspect to the Holmes/Watson relationship that today would be called a bro-mance. (They share clothes. Holmes doesn't like Watson's girlfriend.) But both men have their own love interests. Watson has Mary and Holmes has Irene Adler.Irene (Rachael McAdams) flits in and out of the movie, tantalizing our hero with her feminine wiles. They have a Batman/Catwoman sort of relationship. Holmes is fascinated by Irene since she's the only one who has ever outwitted him (As she does several times in this film) while Irene herself is working as the agent of a mysterious enemy, but her feelings for Holmes cause her to waver in her mission. McAdams makes a very pretty Irene (Who Holmes does not refer to as ""the Woman"", the way he did in the Doyle cannon.) And—as you might expect—she has the requite scene where the pretty girl beats up a couple of large guys.The plot: Holmes has captured the evil Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) who is using ritual sacrifices to call up some unnamed evil. Blackwood predicts his own resurrection and sure enough, no sooner has Watson pronounced him dead from hanging than Blackwood is back, up to his old sorcerer tricks again. It's up to Holmes to find out what the resurrected villain is planning before disaster hits England. Unlike the classic Holmes stories where our hero must save one of two lives, here Holmes is saddled with a Guy Fawkes type plot to destroy parliament and also to re-conquer the American colonies.Downey's Holmes often seems more like Hugh Laurie's Greg House from ""House MD"". He's scruffy, witty, sarcastic and always messing up his best friend's private life. (As many already know, House was based on Holmes, so Ritchie brings the whole thing full circle by basing the new Holmes on House.) The bantering relationship between Holmes and Watson certainly seems inspired by House and Dr. Wilson.There are lots of little Easter-eggs and inside jokes for fans of previous books and films to catch if they're paying attention. The standard Sherlockian trademarks are present, such as the disguises and the oft disdainful relationship with the semi-competent Inspector Lestrade. It actually retains more of the Doyle Holmes than the trailers and previews would make it seem. True, it strays very far from the source material and it may be hard for purists to accept Downey's unkempt urban warrior as the same character portrayed by Basil Rathbone or Jeremey Brett. However, if you can overlook the inaccuracies, this is actually a fun action film. Think of it as a Victorian 'Buddy Cop' action comedy and purists may enjoy it. As for people who don't know much about the Doyle Holmes, they'll find Downey's man-of-action version a lot of fun.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
An amazing twist to a Classic!,"Sherlock Holmes in my opinion is a must see. It does stay true to the guidelines the original Sherlock Holmes stories provided. There is a twist however, and Holmes is a lot grittier, and more physical than he would be in the originals. For some this is going far against what the story should have been like. For me however, I thought it was really a great twist, not a better Sherlock Holmes, but a different one.The fight scenes (or ""pre-fight scenes) were my favorite parts of the movie, how he would break down in his head what exactly he would be doing, and then perform the actions without error.I don't want to give away too much, so I'll end the review with this: If you are a hardcore original Sherlock Holmes story fan, this may not be the movie for you. If not, I think anyone else would love this movie from start to finish.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Been there done that, but fun nonetheless","This is basically the comedy version of ""From Hell."" Sherlock Holmes it ain't. However, Downey Jr. does a good job despite being a GQ take on Arthur Conan Doyle's creation.In this vision, Sherlock doesn't use Heroine, he is instead a muscle bound boxer. He doesn't play the violin to annoy Watson, instead playing one like a ukulele for captured flies.Watson feels more sidekick than ever, but Jude Law makes the most of it. Rachel McAdams is all window dressing, but almost completely forgettable.Not many surprises and so not much to write about other than this isn't much of a thinker, but a good time.Though it isn't much in the end, Sherlock Holmes is by far the best thing Guy Ritchie has done. Pigs, slo-motion boxing, yep its a Guy Ritchie film, but again, better than he has done before.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
A fresh slant on a classic character,"For those more familiar with the deerstalker hat and cape which is how Holmes was depicted pictorially only, this version of Sherlock Holmes may come as a surprise. Ritchie draws out some of Holmes' lesser known traits here such as his bohemian nature; often high, slightly bedraggled and manic depressive off the job, and sometimes on it. These are accurate character traits, and the Holmes in need of some TLC comes straight out of Conan Doyle's stories.So while Downey Jr doesn't look like the typical Holmes image and Sidney Paget's drawings of the character, his look stubble aside is more in keeping with Doyles writings and I did find him an interesting Holmes (though if it'd been me I'd have wanted Paul Bettany for the part). Downey Jr and Law obviously click well off screen and this shows in their performances. They have an excellent and witty rapport and I look forward to future instalments with these twoJudging from the trailers I was expecting this film to be Sherlock Holmes the comedy. Having read all of the Holmes stories several times over, I was slightly disappointed at this prospect, but luckily this is more a darkly humorous action movie - the trailers actually just show the most obviously funny moments back to back. Overall Ritchie goes for a reasonably serious if slightly shallow and super hero styled update to the characterWe're dipped straight into the life of Holmes and Watson, in keeping with the original stories, and there are no boring introductions or origins filler to sit through. the plot is otherwise quite unlike any of Conan Doyles original stories though, more like a comic book, and I think this is the films weakest link. There's certainly lots of murder and mystery on offer but the story lacks the finesse of Doyles writingsIn terms of the films component parts I loved the score which was constantly interesting. The visuals are stunning with London looking suitably smoky and mysterious.The film includes some great action set pieces and I think audiences young and old will be satisfied with this Sherlock Holmes. While I'm most definitely not a fan of Guy Ritchie's past endeavours, I think he has made a creative resurgence here after dumping some old baggage",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
For those who've never seen Jeremy Brett's Sherlock Holmes PLEASE DO SO,"When you make a movie based on beloved classical fictional characters such as Holmes & Watson, expectations are sure to follow. Had this movie used been made NOT based on these two legendary characters, I believe people would have reviewed it more favourably.I've read all the books, watched all the DVDs I can get my hands own, and have studied the various interpretations of Holmes & Watson on-screen & on-stage and I was hoping that the success of this movie would trigger a resurrection of interest in the original Conan Doyle stories, perhaps an introduction of the original stories to a newer generation (i.e. similar to a Harry Potter or Twilight).However, in wanting to appeal to a modern movie-viewing audience I think the movie failed on many counts -- not glitzy & exciting enough for modern day movie-go'ers new to Sherlock Holmes and way too off-the-mark with traditional Sherlockians.If this is your FIRST introduction to Holmes, please do yourself a favour and give Conan Doyle's stories their proper due by renting or borrowing one of the many movies with Jeremy Brett as Holmes. In my opinion, they are the closest to the stories, and they are WONDERFULLY shot & photographed -- and Brett himself throws truly BECOMES Holmes.The stories themselves stand on their own, more than 100 years later -- that cannot be said of this horrible movie rendition.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

I believe however, this movie is great being portrayed the way it is. The point is to have a modern day Sherlock Holmes and not some 1800's London bastard. It's a heroic story. The idea is none less than ""Superman"" and ""Spiderman"", so there should be no need to drag this movie down with aged acting when we have the great Robert Downey Jr. here to give us what he does best, and that is pleasing the crowd. This guy has never disappointed me (from Air America to Iron Man).Great action, great plot, great acting, great movie.On a side note, speaking of hero movies I think they should remake a Flash superhero movie.

Cast in reverse for some reason,"This film was, in my opinion, a perfect example of casting gone bad...Jude Law would have made an excellent Sherlock Holmes and Robert Downie Jr. would have made an excellent Dr. Watson...alas, they did it backwards, and the results are a funny Sherlock and a serious Dr. Watson. In short, it is quite the bastardization of the original concept, which is an excellent and timeless work of creative fiction. Also, and this should come as no surprise, the action sequences (action sequences in Sherlock Holmes?) were out of step with the original work, and came off as kind of tasteless in the true sense of the word-as in like eating cardboard. Maybe a fun bang for your buck if you are stuck at a shopping mall one afternoon and you have decided to depart the shopping experience for a film escape-it is that, but it just isn't up to snuff as far as film adaptations go. The historic time period visuals are left behind in the wake of casting the film the wrong way round, as is much of Sherlock Holmes dialogue, which is also frequently muffed by actor Robert Downie Jr.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Too bad the action scenes are all chopped up,"There is no point in my repeating all the stuff that you can read in the hundreds of other reviews, so I am going to talk about one aspect that no one else seems to want to talk about. The action scenes are unwatchable because they are all chopped up. They are filmed from multiple camera angles and then the footage from the different cameras is spliced together in a way where no single camera remains for more than about a half second. I have noticed this technique in several other movies in recent years, a notable example of which was the first Bourne movie, and one of the Batman movies. This is a decidedly inferior technique, and any director worth a fraction of what they are paid should know better than to use this sloppy technique. The reason for using is probably twofold. They probably believe that many viewers like this technique, because the rapid camera cuts simulate fast action and increase the adrenaline level of the viewers. For me, it just creates nausea. The other reason is that it is cheap in terms of time spent with the highly paid actors. Rather than have them go through lengthy rehearsals with professional stunt people so that they can pull off a decent semblance of a fight scene, they step through a sequence of stop-motion or slow- motion poses. It amounts to stop-motion animation pulled off with real actors. It comes off as fake, and merely annoying. No movie that relies on this technique deserves a good rating, no matter how good it is in other respects. Were it not for this problem, I would have given this movie a 9 rating, because other than this, it really is an outstanding movie. But it is pulled way down by the use of this decidedly inferior cost-saving technique.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"much better than i expected, me old china plate","Very good.I thought this - from the ad - was going to be a steam punk atrocity + ghosts and monsters running around, sort of capper.The look and feel is great - dirty and grimy across the board, with some great touches with regard to Holmes' analysis of situations coupled with a darker observation on his 'appetites'.The best bit of this film is that it stays true to the original stories - I can say no more than that without ruining it.A major leap for Ritchie - he seems to have being trying to continue a franchise (Lock Stock..., Snatch, etc.) for so long, and failing, and has suceeded in creating a new one against numerous odds....psychological recovery, six months.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Maybe not for Sherlock Holmes and crime stories fans?,"I went to the movies watching Sherlock Holmes with the expectation to see a good movie, and the movie lived up to my expectations and more.I've never read any of the books, nor seen any of the older Sherlock Holmes movies, however I do have a little bit of knowledge on Sherlock Holmes anyway. I must admit that the movie, was more of an action move than I expected, as I've always thought that Sherlock Holmes would be more within the genre of Crime / Thriller and less of an action movie. So I'm not quite sure how well the movie captures the real universe of Sherlock Holmes, so it might not be the best movie to watch if you really like the books and crime stories.With that say I actually think they've done a quite good job creating Sherlock Holmes and Watson, even though the movie is a bit more about action that I expected. The actors do a great job too.The story is good, although as mentioned a lot of time is spend on action. This means that the story is not that complete and I felt that some information were left out or simply not written, which is a shame. I also feel that it is hard to think a head in the movie, at least when I watched it I didn't think ahead to try to solve the mystery at all.Overall this is a good movie, however it's more of an action movie than I would expect and I think if your mind is really focused on watching a crime movie where you should try solving a mystery you might be disappointed. I didn't go into the movie with that in my mind, and I enjoyed this movie a lot.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
A Triumphant Remake,"Guy Ritchie finally comes of age as a Director with this compelling re envisaging of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes. Ritchie's love of London, and his status as a Londoner, permeate every aspect of this tale as he cleverly uses familiar settings to represent familiar characters in a modern, yet faithful way. Robert Downey Jnr plays Holmes as an eccentric, other worldly eccentric. Jude Law plays Dr Watson as the straight ""foil"" in a pairing that exudes chemistry and the obvious enjoyment of both men in their respective roles.Past Ritchie movies, in particular ""Lock, Stock..."" and ""Snatch"" have offered some wonderful set pieces, but a disjointed narrative. With the benefit of Holmes and Watson having an understood back story, and a well written and clearly defined plot, the surprise here is that this frees Ritchie up to deliver some excellent scenes in context. A fight in a shipyard's slipway is the pick of the bunch, closely followed by peril in an abattoir with shades of James Bond, a marvellously recreated bare knuckle fight reprises the grit that is his trademark, and the showdown on Tower Bridge is a glorious piece of kitsch.Many of the backdrops are computer generated , but this in no way detracts from the credibility of proceedings. Beautifully, and authentically costumed, but often shot in the dark, a slightly surreal sense of fantasy is created which serves the purposes of the plot perfectly. A witty, quick-fire script has verbal and visual gags aplenty which help to keep up a relentless pace in between action sequences. The editing never allows a pause for breath and the two hour running time flies by.Although the plot itself is neatly topped and tailed as villain Lord Blackwood, gleefully played by Mark Strong, is vanquished, an accomplice vanishes, leaving the door open for the sequel which will surely follow . That this will certainly be Ritchie's most successful film to date, yet contains no bad language or graphic violence, will cause many to reappraise his talents and may encourage Ritchie himself to explore further hitherto untapped areas in which he shows both promise and talent.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Holmes, Sherlock Holmes","He's lean! He's mean! He's a kick-ass crime fighter and the baddest dude this side of Pickadilly Circus! He's Holmes, Sherlock Holmes!Huh?When it was announced that macho director Guy Ritchie was going to make a Sherlock Holmes movie, with the intention of turning the renown sleuth into a rough and tumble action hero, there were more than a few eyebrows raised. With the announcement that the part would be taken over by the very American, very sardonic Robert Downey Jr. further puzzlement followed. The mystery being ""Why?""Holmes is a legendary character, and his iconic image is firmly implanted in our pop culture. The continuing respect for the character is rooted in that image, not in the actual quality of the mysteries that were devised for Holmes to solve by his creator Arthur Conan Doyle. The prevailing image of Holmes as being tall, slender, somewhat solemn and the epitome of Edwardian gentlemanliness is hard to shake, whether the actor in the part plays it stoically (Basil Rathbone), neurotically (Nicol Williamson) or comedic (George C. Scott). The decision to give us a Sherlock who is violent, belligerent and of questionable hygiene is the biggest mystery in SHERLOCK HOLMES – if Ritchie didn't like the traditional Holmes, then why did he bother to make a film centered on him?In fairness, Doyle's Holmes was not above resorting to physical violence and using a firearm now and again. But those were on rare occasions, the traditional Holmes had intellect as his primary weapon and that sufficed quite nicely. Ritchie's detective comes off as a pistol-packing hooligan who frequents Fight Club matches, whose residence at 227B Baker Street could best be described as squalid and whose personal appearance could generously be called perpetually scruffy. While the traditional Holmes was of the upper class, but who could move around among the lower classes, it is unlikely that this Holmes would be comfortable or be accepted among the titled. In essence, the filmmakers have taken the less savory aspects of the Holmes adventures and moved them to the forefront, for reasons that just aren't clear. Maybe the filmmakers thought a character with genteel qualities would just be too uncommercial for modern audiences. That is rather sad. There just was no call to re-imagine Sherlock Holmes as being down and dirty.That is not to say that Downey gives a bad performance as Holmes, only that he comes off as being Holmes in name only. He gives us a passable British accent and plays the part with a degree of shifting moods. Indeed, had he not been playing Sherlock Holmes, and had instead been cast as an original character, say, an Irwin Smithers or a Nigel Butterworth, then maybe his work wouldn't seem so vaguely disappointing. A bit more of his impish sense of humor – which added so much to IRON MAN -- would have been a welcomed addition and helped ease in the character as a tongue in cheek homage.But to pretend for a moment this isn't a Sherlock saga, how is the film? Well, Holmes' attempts to sabotage the impending marriage between Jude Law's Dr. Watson and his future bride, Mary, gives the film an unexpected homo-erotic subtext that is amusing and rather sweet. Beyond that, with it's impressive sets and CGI effects, elegantly overplayed supervillain, colorful assassins, overly choreographed out-of-nowhere fight sequences and a long-winded and convoluted narrative about a super secret organization and a megalomaniac's plot to take over the world all makes the film seem less a Sherlock Holmes adventure and more like an Edwardian version of a James Bond movie. In the end, it would seem that Ritchie tried to tackle one British literary icon and inadvertently made a film about another one -- though still as a grungy and unpleasant recreation.The box office success of SHERLOCK HOLMES could inspire other nefarious re-imaginings; like Jackie Chan as martial arts master Charlie Chan. Or maybe Jean-Claude Van Damme as an intense adventurer named Hercule Poirot. I can see it now: ""She's hot! She's sexy!! She's the Hell-raising Mistress of Crime!!! Angelina Jolie IS Miss Jane Marple!!!!""Well, maybe not.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

Sherlock Holmes is well worth a trip to the theater,"Sherlock Holmes is a 2009 film adaptation of Conan Doyle's fictional character of the same name. The film was directed by Guy Ritchie.Robert Downey, Jr, Jude Law respectively portray Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.In 1891 London, Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey, Jr.) and Dr. John Watson (Jude Law) race to prevent a human sacrifice ritual conducted by Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong). Holmes and Watson stop the sacrifice just in time and neutralize Lord Blackwood.Three days after Blackwood's execution, his tomb is found shattered, from the inside out, and an eyewitness reports seeing Blackwood walking away. Holmes and Watson find Blackwood's coffin contains the body of a red haired midget. Holmes follows clues from a pocket watch on the body to the midget's home, where they discover several chemistry experiments.With Watson and Adler (Rachel McAdams), Holmes takes them to the sewers below Parliament where they find a machine that is operated by a remote trigger held by Blackwood that will release a cyanide derivative into the Parliament chambers. Holmes recounts that all of Blackwood's ""mystical"" acts (including faking his own death) were simply applications of science and trickery.Adler explains about Professor Moriarty, and warns Holmes that Moriarty ""is just as brilliant as he is, and infinitely more devious"".In the final scene, The police arrive to report a dead officer found near Blackwood's device, and Holmes deduces that fighting Blackwood was a diversion by Moriarty. Holmes accepts the case.To talk about performances, Robert Downey Jr:He's great. Fun to watch, attractive, clever, he's the whole package. Bit old, but you will forget that with his tricks and charm.Jude law is also upto the mark and Rachel McAdams is soo cute. Dialogs are quick and superb. Background score is electrifying.The fight scenes, you will love them. Only bad thing is make-up.This film is well worth a trip to the theater if you're looking for a fun ride that is easy to watch. It's not perfect but if you're looking to be entertained for a few hours without having to think or feel too much.

Sherlock Holmes,"Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes is unsurprisingly not faithful to Arthur Conan Doyle's stories, however this does not necessarily make it a bad film, and it is possible for Ritchie and co. to have made an impressive film with the Sherlock Holmes character. Hiring the charismatic Robert Downey Jr. and using ""Batman Begins"" as the template for a critically and commercially successful opening to a film franchise.Alas, the film isn't very good. Guy Ritchie's fingerprints are on the film as seen in the bare knuckle fighting sequences and the use of the city of London as a backdrop and character. There is also the usual traits of Hollywood blockbusters; fight scenes, CGI explosions and cartoonish villains with a plot to take over the world. Conan Doyle's ideas are marginalised but they provide the best bits of the film. The character of Sherlock Holmes is vividly brought to life by Downey Jr. who interprets the character as an arrogant, charming genius who needs to be occupied by a case or he'll fall apart. There are hints of a clever plot, however the plot is rushed and underdeveloped resulting in an absurd plot by the two dimensional villain Lord Blackwood to restore the British Empire. Instead of plot development there are several fight scenes and explosions which add nothing of substance and add little style.""Sherlock Holmes"" takes little from Arthur Conan Doyle's stories and makes up the rest with Hollywood blockbuster clichés and the tiresome traits of Guy Ritchie's films, resulting in a poor adaptation and a poor film.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Enjoyable Movie,"I enjoyed this movie. I heard of Sherlock Holmes before but never read any books involving him. So I went to this movie with an open mind and I have to say, that I really like his character. I know his character has been modified to appeal to the current generation of moviegoers, but he is still very much likable. Comical, brilliant and charismatic. Robert Downey who plays the role of Sherlock Holmes, was perfect. The character was so lively.I am just upset that the movie was so dark, in fact it freaks me out. Is it so hard to ensure that the visuals are bright ? I had difficulty in following that English accent too but only in some parts.This movie is for everyone- adults and children.

A fun Victorian romp that works on that level but not much more than that.,"This isn't Sherlock Holmes ... this is Guy Richie's Sherlock Holmes. Somehow, someone thought Holmes needs updating and how does Hollywood like to update something as quiet and collected as Holmes? Why by adding lots of action and some shirtless scenes, of course!As Holmes and Watson have been transformed into wisecracking action heroes, Downey Jr enthusiastically hams it up as the intelligent layabout, while Law plays sidekick Watson as a annoyed babysitter to Holmes, who's also handy with a pistol.The standouts are Strong as the effectively creepy 'sorcerer' but wasted are Reilly and a miscast beguiling temptress McAdams - both women look too modern for the period as does Downey Jr too. They all might as well have been listening to iPods as that's how outThe plot is pretty much a seeming resurrection and 'tonight Lords, we're going to take over the world' by means of 'black magic'. The homo erotic undertones of the bickering pair is glaringly obvious and initially amusing but gets tired pretty quickly. As for Holmes powers of deduction, it's pretty feeble here, like a particularly weak episode of CSI. Holmes just doesn't seem to have the great deductive mind he's made out to be. I don't find it wholly convincing. Him as a drunk, fine. As an intelligent mastermind? Not really.I dislike Richie's visual style of slow-mo and speed-up, quite violent fight scenes. However, where I think the film main enjoyment lies, is in some good set-piece action scenes. Victorian London looks authentic enough(dirty and bustling with life) but as aforementioned, the anachronistic looking Downey Jr, McAdams and Reilly take me out of the period in scenes they appear.The score by Hans Zimmer is another one of the strengths of the film - jaunty, tongue-in-cheek, dark(in places outside the main leitmotif) and memorable, it sets the tone of this barnstorming adventure well.Overall: It can be enjoyed as a geezer type update of Holmes and is entertaining on that level, but lacks in other vital areas that make Conan Doyle's shrewd sleuth who he is - these two could just have been any other fictional Victorian adventures, to me. Fun, but quite insubstantial .",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
A sorcerer was killed and yet his magic is still going on. Sherlock Holmes given the much needed job of finding out what is going on. Meanwhile Dr. Watson wants out.,"I came into this movie a little unsure of what the outcome would be. Robert Downey Jr. is never predictable and the combination of him and Jude Law made me a little nervous. Then add Rachel McAdams in the mix and I'm thinking it's gonna be an interesting ride. However, I was very surprised at how well they all worked together and how well they performed their roles. I've never been a fan of Jude Law up until this movie, he was pretty fantastic. Robert Downey Jr. was excellent in the role of a broody, cooky, way-to-smart-for-his-own-good, Sherlock Holmes, and Jude Law was pretty awesome in the supporting role of Dr. Watson. I do wish however that Rachel McAdams had been in the movie more because I loved her character and she was also fantastic in her role. I was amazed at the costumes and how beautiful they were. Especially Rachel McAdams dresses, they were perfect for the character and amazing for the period. Although the director did take some liberties in the technology and fashion of the period during the climax of the movie. McAdams is wearing a pants suit and there is a device that would have needed batteries to work. But it made for a fantastic ending, McAdams looked fantastic and the movie ended with a bank. Which was the whole point of the movie anyway probably.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Entertaining enough, but far from perfect","Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) is terrorizing England until he is finally captured by Detective Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) and his trusty partner Dr. John Watson (Jude Law). But after being put to death, Blackwood returns from the grave and intensifies his plot to control the country. Of course, with Scotland Yard only moderately helping, it is up to Holmes to defeat Blackwood.I was really pumped for Sherlock Holmes based solely off trailers, even if Guy Ritchie's contemporary interpretation did not necessarily coincide with the mainstream image of Holmes (a bare-knuckle boxer, really?). It also helps that in the tail end of the decade, Downey Jr. can basically do no wrong acting wise, as he either owns every movie he is in or makes subpar movies watchable for his performance alone (as anyone who has seen the Oscar-baiting film The Soloist can attest). But while the film's trailers make the film look like an riotously funny, action packed time, the film itself is a little different.Having not even attempted to view Swept Away (or Revolver in its entirety), I cannot speak for Richie's complete directorial resume. But Sherlock is both his slowest paced film, and the least stylistically edited. Whereas Snatch and RocknRolla were both off the rails editing wise, packed with plenty of style and Tarantino-infused dialogue and scenery, Sherlock comes off as a far more brooding film. Right after the opening sequence, I knew the film would feel every bit of its 130-minute running time, and to my surprise, it felt even longer. Some scenes drag out far past their best before date, and others just feel like they could have been edited a bit better. None of this makes the film bad per se, but it does take away from the lasting effect the film gives. I enjoyed the rocking action scenes, but by the end of the film, I just really wanted it to end more than anything.Compounding these lengthy scenes are more than a handful that take the viewer out of the film. I understand Holmes as a character has a penchant for being very particular about how he acts as a detective (by means of course, of someone from the late 1800s), but some of the more theoretical material just seems like it got beaten to death over the course of the film. One specific scene in particular, involving drugs and black magic, just looked totally out of place in context with the rest of the film. I was more confused than anything seeing some of these scenes play out, and really wanted to believe the filmmakers could have pulled some of it together more cohesively and in a shorter running time. I really wanted to adore the movie, but it was scenes like that which seemed like they were better off on the cutting room floor.What it seems like the filmmakers focused on instead was bringing the world of Sherlock Holmes to life. The atmosphere, the mood, the feeling of every set and every costume feels very much in the realm of what we have come to know and love about the character. It may have been made in the late 2000s, but it feels very much like it belongs in the late 1800s. Yes, some of the effects look like they could have been better rendered, but the world Sherlock lives in is near perfect. The scenery and art direction practically comes to life as the camera sweeps past its luscious beauty. Every single corner is very much of its time, right to the last minute detail. Visually, the film is stunning in every frame, and the running time only helps to showcase it strongly in each scene.But the greatness that lies within Sherlock Holmes belongs solely with the cast more than anything else. Even at its most incredulous or boring sequences, never once does the cast change for an instant. Everyone is right at home in their roles, embodying them with a hint of class and a great deal of precision. They all feel just as real as the next person, and help make the film all the more authentic.Downey Jr. as said previously can do no wrong and only further proves it in the title role. He is electrifying from start to finish, nailing the British accent to a tee, and nailing this new age Sherlock even better. While it is not quite as perfect a performance as his rendition of Tony Stark (who after multiple viewings, has proved to be the role he was born to play), his interpretation of Sherlock is very strong. The unreliable and questionable techniques Sherlock is known for are made all the better in Downey Jr.'s hands. The man has come a long way as an actor, and it is roles like these that stretch his range and make him all the better.While I was baffled at the thought of Law as Watson, he proves to be even better than I imagined he would be. It helps that he is actually from the United Kingdom and is not just putting on his accent, but watching him act alongside Downey Jr. in some of the more fun sections of the film only proves that he was the right man for the job. While I would have liked a bit more emphasis on Black's Blackwood, he does a more than adequate job with what he is given. Much the same goes for Rachel McAdams as the mysterious Irene Adler, who spends the majority of the film as more of an enigma than the love interest she should be.While it is far from perfect, there is more than enough to enjoy from Sherlock Holmes. The feel of the film makes it a worthwhile watch on its own, but the performances of Downey Jr. and Law are what really drive the film.7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Underwhelming,"Jude Law is one of my favorite actors and I'm starting to really enjoy Robert Downey Jr after Iron Man. Guy Ritchie is stylish and can create a FUN experience at the movies (LSATSB). But after watching the first previews for Sherlock Holmes, I admit I was a bit underwhelmed. It seemed like they were going for style and very little substance. I think that is a shame, considering the substance is Sherlock Holmes, a character with a lot of potential. There is no doubt Robert Downey Jr. is charismatic and fun, but I never really saw him as Sherlock Holmes, but rather Tony Stark playing Sherlock Holmes. For me to recommend a movie, it has to stay with me, but with a boring plot that I didn't care about, this movie was forgettable. The occasional bits of humor aren't even close to recommending it. Its a shame with such a talented cast. C-",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Sherlock ADHD,"Why did I find this movie totally boring?The acting: None of the characters could hold my attention. All of them lacked a soul. Watching Robert Downey Jr is like watching a brick wall, nothing happens, only a negative radiation and a view in a bottomless lake. The 2 leading ladies were also a big disappointment, catwalk faces with zero expression. Ow, how I missed a Hitchcock heroin. I always love Jude Law but here his sparkles also die and it's not his fault, he was still the best of them all. Btw, Jude looks very sexy with mustache.The directing: Guy Ritchie probably focused only on the visuals and the story. As far as scenery and so on the movies is okay. The story however is way too blurry and unnecessarily complex and far-fetched. A typical boy's story, -now this happens now that happens- -this is fun that is fun- with no thoughts about the feelings to trigger with the viewer. Everything we get to see is brainy and rational. 19th Century London could have been breathtaking atmospheric if only this product wasn't aimed at the ADHD generation.Digital filming: it is obvious this movie was not shot on celluloid but digitally shot which saves a lot of money. The problem with digital shooting becomes clear during action scenes, they are not fluid but shaky. Also the dynamics between light and dark are very limited. The whole movie is covered in a boring grey scale which even covers the girls make up.The editing: It is way too fast, so none of the scenes make it to the unconsciousness or can become iconic.Music and sound: I can't remember any tune anymore, except that left and right speakers continually gave dis adjusted sounds.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Want to know what a knowledgeable Sherlock Holmes fan thinks?,"First, bravo to Guy Ritchie for pulling it off. I'm not only a traditional Sherlock Holmes fan. I wrote a new Sherlock Holmes story for a screen writing class back in 1995, and read every one of Conan Doyle's original stories, as well as re-watched the entire British television series starring the unmatchable Jeremy Brett as part of my research into the character.So with all this psychological baggage in hand, I went into the show with a less than optimistic expectation. For example, I initially thought that whoever decided to cast Robert Downey Jr. in the role of Sherlock probably didn't have the slightest idea about the character Conan Doyle intended. That said however, I will admit Robert Downey Jr. did indeed succeed in doing the part justice given his exceptional acting talent. Nonetheless, there were other more ""suitable"" choices out there that would have been entirely in keeping with the classic depiction. And since Jeremy Brett is no longer with us, others like Charles Dance, who appeared in Michael Collins which starred Liam Neeson, should have been on the ""A"" list of contenders because of his intended resemblance to the character. Another ""no brainer"" candidate would have been Hugh Laurie of Dr. House fame.Remember all those years when everyone wanted Pierce Brosnan to play James Bond, but he was unavailable because of his television contract obligations to play ""Remington Steel""? Was Hugh Laurie your first choice but was unavailable? All Hugh Laurie would need is to have his hair dyed black and slicked down with oil, and he would have suited the role perfectly, with a ready-made fan base to boot.Otherwise, as one experienced writer to all those who worked on the script congratulations. Many witty lines, a few inside jokes, and a generous dose of trivia elements only the well-read Sherlock Holmes fan would likely pick up and appreciate, like the main character's ability to speak French owing to his partial French ancestry, or Dr. Watson's first name (John), or Watson's future wife's name (Mary), or Sherlock's brother's name (Mycroft)... and one could go on.But then there was the injection of a non-Sherlock Holmes influence in the way of a big bad guy akin to the giant in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Was that a Guy Ritchie homage to the film that first got him into film?But the foregoing are not the reasons I'm not giving this film a 10. It's because of the film's over-reliance on ""action"" sequences to tell the story, while de-emphasizing the intellectual dimension of classic Sherlock Holmes stories. If Ritchie could have brought the same amazing genius he was able to effect in ""Revolver"", by allowing us to hear more of the inside of the mind of the main character working out the guts of the problem, than just in certain slow-mo fight scenes, he could have done no less here, for the mind of Sherlock Holmes is a story dimension onto itself.The depiction of London was superb of course. It caught the flavour and set the right mood, especially Tower Bridge under construction.Finally, just a few other small hiccoughs. I found was that the viewer is really never given enough clues to piece the solution to the story for himself, unless of course one was a veritable student of chemistry. I'm not sure if Conan Doyle would have approved of leaving so few clues for the reader or the extremely rapid pacing of the story. But it was still an entertaining film to watch, and as I said in the opening, Guy Ritchie and cast pulled it off.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Skip It,"Sherlock Holmes, what a disappointment. When I saw the original trailer I thought this would be an exciting movie. Not so. I am a Robert Downy fan, but even he can't save this film. At one point I turned to my fiancé and said sarcastically ""didn't see that one coming"". Shortly after that, we walked out on the film, 55 minutes into the movie to be exact. To give this bad movie a little love, the fight scenes were cool, but it wasn't enough to keep this movie alive. A big budget period picture with a great cast and an intriguing storyline, but nothing to back it up.

Excellent Sherlock Holmes Adaptation,"This was a very good adaptation of the classic detective series. While purists of the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle novels may sniff at the liberties that Film Director Guy Ritchie took with the title character Holmes and his faithful sidekick, Dr. Watson, the movie was highly entertaining with great cinematography and a fast paced plot that didn't let up throughout and kept the viewer in suspense up until the very end. In other words, it was well worth the money and I will be looking forward to the next installment, which will feature the better known nemesis, Dr. Moriarty.Robert Downey Jr. was excellent as Holmes. He is one of the best actors for this type of role, a flawed super hero who doesn't take himself too seriously. Jude Law was up to the task of playing Dr. Watson, and Rachel McAdams was excellent as the mystery woman who is both the object of Holmes affections and a possible adversary. The rest of the supporting cast was also first rate. Guy Ritchie deserves a lot of praise for pulling all of this together.

"Funny, Suspenseful, Mysterious, Ingenious. Sherlock Holmes is all that plus more","I will not review Alvin and The Chipmunks: The Squeakuel for it is too bad for words. Sherlock Holmes sheds light on the long forgotten tales of the detective and his devoted friend Watson. Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) has made his reputation finding the truth at the heart of the most complex mysteries. With the aid of Dr. John Watson (Jude Law), his trusted ally, the renowned ""consulting detective"" is unequaled in his pursuit of criminals of every stripe, whether relying on his singular powers of observation, his remarkable deductive skills, or the blunt force of his fists.But now a storm is gathering over London, a threat unlike anything that Holmes has ever confronted and just the challenge he's looking for.After a string of brutal, ritualistic murders, Holmes and Watson arrive just in time to save the latest victim and uncover the killer: the unrepentant Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong). As he approaches his scheduled hanging, Blackwood—who has terrorized inmates and jailers alike with his seeming connection to dark and powerful forces—warns Holmes that death has no power over him and, in fact, his execution plays right into Blackwood's plans.And when, by all indications, Blackwood makes good on his promise, his apparent resurrection panics London and confounds Scotland Yard. But to Holmes, the game is afoot.Racing to stop Blackwood's deadly plot, Holmes and Watson plunge into a world of the dark arts and startling new technologies, where logic is sometimes the best crimefighting weapon but where a good right hook will often do the job.

Interesting and entertaining adaptation,"A mark of great characters is their versatility. There have been many iterations of Sherlock Holmes, many of them quite different from one another. Yet most of them feel true to the character, because Arthur Conan Doyle wrote him to have enough depth for such variations. Sherlock Holmes can be calm, deductive and collective. He can be passionate, intuitive and more than a bit crazy. He can be loving, he can be cruel, he can be unpredictable and if handled with care, it'll all feel true.Guy Ritchie's take on the character, as realized by Robert Downey Jr., falls on the more eccentric end of the scale. His Holmes accentuates the madness of the character, the razor sharp edge between lunacy and genius. Yet he's never out of the line. There's reason to his madness and when he suddenly sobers up and functions with frightening purpose, it doesn't feel out of place. Beautiful performance by Downey and the utmost reason why this film works so well.Though I feel I must praise Jude Law's take on Dr. Watson as well. His is a more subtle performance and whenever he shares screen time with Downey, he recedes to his superior presence. But that's the essence of Watson, so it feels quite fitting. I also really enjoyed his sarcasm and tired frustration. A nicer and more civilized Watson would have felt out of place next to Downey, but with Law they manage to strike the perfect balance.Furthermore, it's an excellent film on the technical side of things. The soundtrack is superb, the set and clothing designs are marvelous, the action scenes have suitable weight behind them and as a whole the story is paced nicely. The plot itself isn't anything spectacular, but this is a movie you're going to see for the experience, not because it has something meaningful to say.Are you a fan of action mystery stories with glib sense of humour, charismatic acting and excellent production values? Then I'd suggest giving this one a chance.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Indiana Holmes and the Masonic House of Lords,"Rarely have I hated a film as much as I did this rendition of Sherlock Holmes. Blame the script, and to some extent, the director for willingly filming this mess. They have completely misinterpreted one of the greatest characters ever, presenting Holmes as an Action Figure. What is it about Hollywood that thinks we want to see vast conspiracy cults, intent upon taking over the city, the world, the universe? Why do they continue to turn already entertaining stories into total mishmashes of roller coaster, smash-boom-bah adventures? Whether ""Dragnet,"" or ""Temple of Doom,"" or ""National Treasure,"" it seems that the Suits in Hollywood want every film to imitate the original Indiana Jones with a measure of Da Vinci Code on the side.Granted, I have been a major Holmes fan ever since seeing the Basil Rathbone version of ""Hound of the Baskervilles"" long ago and then reading ""Red Headed League"" in grade school. Since then, I've read the entire collection and enjoyed more Rathbone and the wonderful Jeremy Brett interpretations on PBS, as well as some other more forgettable ""consulting detectives."" What they all have in common-- what makes Holmes such a memorable character-- is their reliance of the cerebral to solve the crime; not the physical.Ritchie gives us a few inklings into Holmes deductive reasoning, to show us that the little details can contribute to an overall portrait of who, what, when, etc. But he also more frequently has Holmes punching villains, brawling in the betting ring, dodging a massive ship's hull as it lumbers towards him in dry dock, leaping head first out an upper window of the House of Parliament into the Thames, and concluding with a literal cliff hanger atop the then under construction London Bridge. By coincidence, today my cable was also showing a recent James Bond film, and that film offered fewer explosions and violent encounters per minute than SH.I love Robert Downey and Rachel McAdams is a fetching actress-- but both are wasted in this film. I am reminded of a comment made long ago about the filming of ""Gone With the Wind"" which more or less said, ""The audience will forgive you for what you leave out, but they will have a hard time with what you put in."" I'm sorry, but everything that was put into this mess was a travesty to everything that Sherlock Holmes has been for all these years.

Anything But Elementary,"FOR MORE REVIEWS FEEL FREE TO VISIT http://rantsreviews4filmnuts.blogspot.com/Fresh from the superbly crafted RocknRolla, Guy Ritchie churns out a hugely entertaining, high voltage thrill ride which is by far the most superior popcorn movie of the year.After the capture and execution of criminal mastermind Lord Blackwood, reports surface that the evil genius has somehow risen from the grave. With Watson in tow Sherlock Holmes sets about solving a series of murders somehow related to the case whilst dealing with an old flame who has mysteriously re-entered his life.Over the course of the film every pre-conceived notion you thought you had about Holmes mythology flies out the door (for the better i might add) as Ritchie's vision contains far more laughs, action and thrills than poor old Basil Rathbone or any other Holmes imitator could ever hope to imagine. For want of a better word Holmes and Watson kick butt, majorly. Not many directors do action better than Guy Ritchie and the sequences in the film has his unique stamp all over them.The film gets off to a cracking good start, both fast paced and intriguing. Unfortunately it begins to meander during the middle as the increasing number of elements to the case become more and more convoluted. The film also spends more time setting up for a sequel than other movie in recent memory. The faceless villain Moriarty, who is all set to be Holmes next nemesis, nearly gets as much screen time as Lord Blackwood! Despite the poorly paced second half, the chemistry between Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law is enough to keep you watching.Downey Jr makes the role of the infamous detective all his own whilst retaining much of what made Holmes so special in the first place; superior intellect,wit, arrogance and petulance. Physically Downey Jr is about as different as you can get from the popular yet unsubstantiated Holmes iconography that we are usually presented with in adaptions. Yet this new Holmes is so darn likable that you really wouldn't want him any other way. Jude Law is also a far cry from the image of the balding, middle aged doctor we usually associate with Watson. Law invigorates the role, playing seamlessly off Downey Jr. Their relationship is reminiscent of the great buddy films of yesteryear and is one of the highlights of the movie.The supporting cast does not fare as well. The usually scene stealing Mark Strong is kind of a ho-hum villain. We do not spend enough time with his character or know enough about him to consider him a real threat, especially after sitting through endless acts of genius by Holmes, you never really fear that he will get the better of the wonder detective. Rachel McAdams is also miscast as Irene Adler, Holmes love interest and rival. Adams does not possess the maturity in her performance to make you feel as though she is the street savvy, criminal genius that she is made out to be.The look of the film is fantastic. Cinematographer Philippe Rousselot does a superb job at capturing 19th century London in all it's glory; from the docks, to the gritty mean streets to even Buckingham Palace, the film is rich in colour and authenticity. Ritchie's frequent editor James Herbert is back, bringing with him the techniques that make the film look typically Ritchie esquire. From the action sequences to the interweaving of past and present timelines, the editing is top shelf. To round of the high quality productions is super composer Hans Zimmer's musical score, which is one of the best of the year and adds to the overall excitement of the picture.So if your in the mood for a rollicking, fun filled adventure flick that is anything but elementary, you won't do much better than Sherlock Holmes this holiday season",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Nice Updating of the Famous Character,"Sherlock Holmes (2009)** 1/2 (out of 4)Updated version features Robert Downey, Jr. in the role of Sherlock Holmes and Jude Law as his best friend and assistant Dr. Watson. In the film, a man (Mark Strong) dealing in black magic is hung and pronounced dead but soon he rises from the grave with plans that will change the world. Holmes and Watson are on the case along with an old flame (Rachel McAdams) of Holmes'. The character of Holmes has gone through so many changes since the silent days that there's no question people are going to have their own opinion on what the character should or shouldn't be. I personally thought this updated version was pretty good and it at least delivered a character that we haven't seen in any of the dozens of previous films. I enjoyed the visual style that Ritchie brought to the film and I think for the most part he nailed the atmosphere. In a lot of these recent movies that take place in the past, it seems like we just get CGI and no atmosphere but that wasn't the case here. The dark and gloomy look of the film is like something we would have seen from the Universal series of the 40s and that is a plus. There are a couple major problems with the film and the first being the running time. I'm really not sure why so many movies need to run over two-hours these days but a good fifteen-minutes or so could have been trimmed here and we wouldn't have lost anything. Another problem is that the actual story takes a back seat to the visuals, fast editing and loud sound effects. The case involving this man coming back to life was very interesting and when the film centers on this is works very well. The problem is that we get so many distractions that don't work like Watson's upcoming marriage. This woman plot never works and I'd say nothing with McAdams character works either. There's no question she's a fine actress but her role here was pretty worthless. I think Law works out very good as Watson as he has the ability to fit into the character good enough for us to believe he's this smart guy. Downey also manages to fit into the role quite nicely and I think the two men share some good chemistry together and help keep the film moving a lot better than it probably should have. For my money it's Strong who steals the show as the bad guy.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Cyberpunkish Sherlock,"I expected the movie to be exactly the way it was, so I can't rate it higher or lower than average. Set as a prequel to most of the book Sherlock Holmes adventures, it features a physically active Holmes, with a just as sporty Watson, fighting the powers of darkness that infect a masons like secret order in order to control England and then the world. At least they were not teenagers...Was it too far fetched? A little, but the books were also a mix of mystery and cat and mouse games. Was the movie too flashy in its special effects? Yes, and so rendered the fabled deduction capabilities of Sherlock Holmes as nothing more than parlour tricks. His sense of smell was more prevalent in the film than his thinking. Was it entertaining? Sort of, but never over the top.Bottom line: if they would have cut short on the steam age supertechnology and the action sequences and made the script a little more involving, it would have been a much better movie. As such, it remains a silly action film in the same league as Indiana Jones, entertaining, but never engaging.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Very enjoyable!...,"I originally saw this one at the cinema in early 2010; it was a small room, packed out and not much of an enjoyable viewing experience. It has now made it to the small screen and I am able to watch it in comfort so much better! Now, I don't know if it was the better viewing conditions, or the fact I have a better sound system than my local cinema, but I enjoyed this one a tad more second time around. But more of my thoughts later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters please walk Gladstone, the dog, while I write the next paragraph).Holmes and Watson occupy rooms at 221b Baker Street, however, their idyll is soon to be disturbed because Watson has got engaged and plans to move out to be with his new bride. It's Victorian London and they currently have more pressing matters, the game's afoot! We begin with Holmes and Watson closing in on Lord Blackwood, who is in the throws of performing a satanic ritual in the catacombs below London. They successfully apprehend him and he is arrested by Inspector Lestrade. Sentenced to death, Lord Blackwood calls for Holmes and warns him that there will be four more murders. Having been hanged and pronounced dead, by Watson, his body is interred. The following day his tomb has been opened from the inside and he has been seen wandering about the graveyard. It seems Holmes and Watson have another mystery to solve. At this point, Irene Adler, a former adversary of Holmes appears on the scene and commissions him to find a man involved in the Blackwood case. This will lead them to a conspiracy that threatens the bedrock of British society. She is in the employ of a very mysterious stranger, a professor of some kind. I think that's enough to whet you appetite I don't want to give the game away.A very well made film with plenty of action and some really great comedic moments. I loved the interplay between Holmes and Watson; they were almost like an old married couple at times, which was really amusing. Great performances from all of the leading cast, Robert Downey Jr. as Sherlock Holmes, Jude Law as Dr. John Watson, Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler, Mark Strong as Lord Blackwood, Eddie Marsan as Inspector Lastrade and Robert Maillet as Derdger, Holmes's fighting nemesis.I found this a most enjoyable film to watch second time around. The score, by Hans Zimmer was spot on and fitted the action on screen perfectly. Although the dialogue does get a little bogged down at times, there was still plenty to keep the viewer's attention. The fight scenes, and one scene in particular featuring an explosion in slow motion were all excellent hats off to the stunt and technical guys for those! Over all, very entertaining and well worth a viewing!... Recommended.My score: 7.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

"Fun, a tad escapist yet ultimately an entertaining reward","Wherever you may fault Guy Ritchie's take on ""Sherlock Holmes,"" Robert Downey Jr.'s charismatic portrayal of the title character, and Jude Law's sharp and funny portrayal of Holmes' partner Watson, this is, to be sure, a fine bit of movie-making.Capturing, rather well I thought, 19th Century England, with all its dark corners and muddy streets and saucy personas and the bland, monochromatic nature of its buildings and spaces, Ritchie has, at the very least, shown he has a sure hand as a director. The action, the slow-motion replays (before they play, if that makes sense) of Holmes' lightning-quick thought process, and what I thought was a subtle take on Holmes' genius, ultimately makes ""Sherlock Holmes"" a highly entertaining movie.Those looking for the high-brow sophistication, the dry wit, the tweed coats, the deerstalker hats, the aquiline noses of the Basil Rathbones of yore best look elsewhere. Downey, out of necessity, is by no means an ""English"" Holmes, though he hacks an accent away as best he can and what he lacks for in pure Anglo splendor makes up for, as he often does, in raw charisma. Even Holmes' famous pipe is almost an afterthought here. Downey and Ritchie are clearly staking out new territory quite apart from the traditional portrayals of Sherlock Holmes, probably much to the chagrin of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's purists.It's hard to talk much about the plot without giving too much away, but there is certainly some guessing up to the end. It's an involving story line, pretty fun, and Holmes and Watson (and Rachel McAdams' Irene Adler) get into their share of scraps, scrapes, and near-death experiences.I am accustomed to seeing Jude Law as the leading man, but here he is at least a match to Downey as Dr. John Watson, a man quite unable to tear himself from his partner's adventures. He is funny, a little reckless, but trying to reign himself in for marriage's sake.McAdams is substantially out of her depth - it would have been better had they chosen a spry English actress to take on the role of Irene Adler here - but perhaps she got the role because Adler is supposed to be an American (? - sorry I don't know the Holmes' canon that well) - or perhaps they didn't want Downey to get lonely on the set. In any case, her looks carry her certainly but her acting feels mostly one dimensional. She feels lost in the costume and setting and cannot come close to matching Downey's and Law's on-screen presence.There are a host of great English actors taking to various roles, but Mark Strong's portrayal of the evil Lord Blackwood is probably the best. He has a highly tuned and carefully contrived persona, conditioned by his invention of himself as a character within a character. I found it almost entrancing at times.""Sherlock Holmes"" is true fun, an enjoyable movie treat, and more than likely to become yet another movie franchise for Downey to lead. Go see it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
I walked out of this movie,"I've been a Sherlock Holmes fan for 50 years, but I'm not a purist and have long felt that most large screen portrayals of Sherlock Holmes did him a disservice. Should Holmes and Watson be younger than their traditional casting? Certainly! Can Holmes be a man of action? Of course! His physicality was often implied and sometimes written very explicitly in Doyle's stories. I was looking forward to seeing a characterization of Holmes enriched with these under-realized elements.But as eccentric as Holmes was, he was also a man of his times. Early in the film, Holmes goes to dinner with Watson to meet his fiancé Mary-- and he goes unshaved! Holmes may be a slob at home, but he would always be appropriate in public. Then, he insults Mary and Mary throws a glass of wine in his face-- again, two actions that would never take place in the society of the times.Even so, I tried to put my reservations aside. I saw great potential in Robert Downey Jr's interpretation of Holmes, and appreciated Jude Law's re-imagining of Watson. The script, however, failed the characters. Holmes' intellect was mostly ignored; Watson's loyalty was portrayed as irrational. The new interest that Holmes' physicality could have added was undermined because it was overplayed.Worse, the story was confusing and unengaging. About an hour into the movie, I realized that I was remaining in my seat only because of the ticket price. I was bored by the chaos.The sets and art direction were excellent but ultimately lacked impact because of their unrelieved darkness.My biggest disappointment is that this current telling of the Sherlock Holmes story, and the franchise that's bound to follow, will prevent any new re-imagining for years to come.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Downey Jr. is a surprisingly Stellar Holmes,","Sherlock Holmes is a good movie with a well developed plot and a terrific cast. I was not initially sure about Robert Downey Jr. playing Sherlock Holmes, he seemed like a very unusual casting decision, particularly with Iron Man in mind. However, he did a stellar job, he brought a lot of comedic value and had great charisma to the part, although it did make me feel like it was more of a parody to the Sherlock Holmes series more so than a real film at times, he did certainly bring a new and interesting personality to the character.Guy Ritchie was an unusual decision to direct this movie. While he certainly has a unique style, there are certain occasions where he's trying a little too hard to show off the skills he has as a director, rather than letting the story tell itself and allowing his actors to truly shine. The tone was a little inconsistent as well, there were times when it was very light hearted and funny, while other parts were dark and gritty, without allowing much of a transition between the two.I think Jude Law was fantastic as Dr. John Watson. While Downey Jr.'s casting may have been questioned by some, this certainly was not, his personality suited the role perfectly, and he also delivered his own original take on the character very well.Funny and, at times, quite intense. Easy to view and well acted, Sherlock Holmes is certainly worth the watch if you are looking for a good adventure or crime film.The legendary detective must solve the case of a serial killer who appears to have risen from the dead.Best Performance: Robert Downey Jr.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

"""A re invention of a timeless character""","With a rather poor run at Box office, Director Guy Ritchie Redeems himself with a not-so Faithful film adaption of the world's most famous detective.

Sherlock Holmes adapted for XXI century,"I know I'm risking to be misunderstood, but I found that ""holmish"" feeling in the new ""Sherlock Holmes"" from Guy Ritchie. After a few not very successful variations on the ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" theme, director finally happened to create something of his own, but new. G.Ritchie returns again.Yes, the story about Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) gives dynamics to action, no to thought this time. The movie contains as many FX as never before. The famous detective himself is a mix of House, M.D. and CSI agent. Too much fighting and too little sophisticated conversations between Holmes and Watson (Jud Law).However, in my opinion, this movie is a transformation of XIX century detective fiction into the XXI century. The XX century had changed the very style of narration of adventures. Things which had been thrilling the reader in XIX century cannot affect the XXI century viewer in the same level. In order to reach the same highness of tension the radically different stylistic means.The G.Ritchie's narration beginning give the reading clue instantly. In one of the first scenes Holmes is preparing to beat a security guard of Lord Blacwood, who is the main negative character in the movie, despite professor Moriarty. A prolepsis is given: Holmes in advance plans in which order and to which parts of enemy's body he will beat to knock him out. He also calculates what organs will be damaged and how long it will take them to recover. Then he accomplishes it. Yes, it is a detail of the XXI century movie. But it has ""holmish"" sagacity. However, for me personally, Holmes relation with his violin illustrates the transformation mentioned before most accurately. Long known as a fan of this instrument, the famous detective in G.Ritchie's movie plays with violin without a bow. He plays with it with his fingers, as if it is a banjo. This Holmes behaves with a violin as cheeky as a film narrator behaves with the traditional material about the legendary sleuth.By the way, J.Law played Watson is also nonstandard. He is not the smart guy for whom Holmes is only cover as in some other adaptations. He is not a nitwit either, through whom an intelligent detective describes his deductional mind. This time the essence returns – Holmes and Watson is a tandem indeed, the equivalent partners. There wouldn't be a successful end of any case without one of them and there wouldn't be an interesting story without another one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Sherlock Holmes (2009),"Ritchie finally takes the hints and allows others in on his creations. This time he leaves the script alone, so we are free from his mockney ""Cor blimey geezer"" dialogue. Instead, there's more charm and wit here. Law and Downey Jr. make an excellent couple, and aren't afraid to show a true love between Holmes and Watson. They bicker over everything, but it's easy to see they were meant to be.It does have all the action you would expect from a modern Hollywood take on the character, but it doesn't feel too intrusive. Having Holmes plan out his fights in a logical way before making his moves fits an action version of the character. Strong is an excellent villain and an amazing actor. It's an enjoyable romp, even if it doesn't quite break the mold.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"A modern take on the most brilliant literary detective ever, with a fantastic Downey, Jr.!","Published by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, sometime around the turn of the 20th century, the ""Sherlock Holmes"" stories have become classics of British literature, and have been turned into movies or TV Series dozens of times. But then, when you think you have seen it all, seen him solve every possible murder involving every possible scenario (my favorite still being ""The Speckled Band"" about a psychopathic ex-doctor and convicted murderer, who plans to kill his stepdaughters using a poisonous snake), Guy Ritchie comes along and makes a film with the incredibly original and creative title ""Sherlock Holmes"".Now, the highly conservative Holmes fans will probably give this film ten minutes before they throw the remote control at the TV, but those who have never read the stories will most likely appreciate Ritchie's take on the material. From the highly intelligent, charismatic, professional, and dry character in the books, Holmes turns into a crazy, obnoxious and cynical figure, who enjoys fighting and gambling in the boxing ring and even has a love relationship, something unthinkable for the original. Rather than a classic detective story, this is a modern, action film with plenty of chases and explosions, set to the background of 1890s London and except for the basic outline, doesn't have anything in common with the literary style of Conan Doyle's works.Lord Blackwood, a necromancer and practionist of black magic, is caught in the act of performing a deadly ritual on a young woman by Sherlock Holmes and his assistant Dr. Watson and sentenced to death by hanging. Initially, this was also the last case Holmes and Watson were to be working together, before the latter moved out their office and home at Baker Street 221B, and moved together with his girlfriend Mary. Holmes, not too fond of the idea of loosing his partner and best friend, tries to spoil Watson's relationship by any means possible, but he soon realizes that Watson is serious and fears that their long working relationship is over. But then, Lord Blackwood mysteriously vanishes from his grave and is seen wandering around London, murdering the leading members of one of London's secret societies, the Temple of the Four Orders. Watson, who provided the death certificate at Blackwood's execution, is convinced by Holmes to help him close this case, since not only the safety of London is in danger but also Watson's reputation. But soon they discover that there is much more to it, when Irene Adler, a former lover of Holmes shows up in London, but can Holmes still trust her, especially since she doesn't even bother hiding her profession of a thief from him?Whether you like the modern approach to Sherlock Holmes is of very little importance when looking at the stunning sets that have been build up for this film. London looks fascinating, perfectly creating a nostalgic atmosphere and a creepy feeling in its narrow alleys. Then there are famous landmarks,like the half-finished Tower Bridge, or the Docks, which make the entire scenery even more realistic and it's amazing how easy it has become today to age even a city by 100 years without there being a single glitch in the visuals. ""Sherlock Holmes"" is wonderfully constructed as an action movie, with not excessively overused action scenes, but some greatly choreographed fights. There is a moment,relatively early in this movie, when Holmes is in the boxing ring with an opponent and the smug detective analyzes and predicts every single movement he needs to make against that rock of a guy to beat him,something shown in slow motion attacks. Many of the typical Holmes clichés are woven into the story just like that, and most of the time it's just incredibly funny how many references to the Conan Doyle stories are included, but yet this film never becomes a complete parody of the character. Hans Zimmer composed a great score, which has a wonderful old, but energetic feel to it, and was among this year's Oscar nominees for Original Score. The one thing that really bugged me about this so-called ""popcorn flick"" was how much stuff was thrown into the plot regarding the case, and when Holmes eventually starts to reveal the entire mystery towards the end, I had somewhat lost count of which chemicals were used and how exactly everyone met their demise.Robert Downey, Jr. single-handedly brings the character of Sherlock Holmes back to life, and does it in such a funny, fresh, and crazy way, that he proves once more that he could probably play a brick wall and still receive praise for it. This guy really succeeds in all of his roles, and not only does he have the right charisma and believable ingenuity to play the detective, but he's just so damn sympathetic. Dr. Watson is played by Jude Law, who sadly enjoys a very unfair reputation concerning his looks being better than his acting talent has great chemistry with Holmes and makes a rather convincing doctor and, once again different than in the books, is more than capable of taking out guys with a bigger biceps and Pecs than he has. Rachel McAdams looks cute, certainly, but her chances to act are very limited and most of the time her job is either to look hot or seduce Holmes, making their relationship rather dry, shallow and sparkless, while Mark Strong, whom I already liked in ""Body of Lies"" gives a menacing and creepy performance as Lord Blackwood.""Sherlock Holmes"" deserves compliments for its freshness and originality in bringing an old-fashioned literary character back to screen. Conan Doyle would probably role over in his grace if he knew this film existed, but those who really want to see an exciting, fast-paced and somewhat unusual flick, should definitely not miss this one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

exactly what i feared,"When I heard that Guy Ritchie was making a Sherlock Holmes movie I shuddered. I had a horrible idea of a stupid, glossy action movie that had nothing to do with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's writing.The casting of Robert Downey Junior and Jude Law did little to reassure me.The movie was everything I feared..a steampunk version of Holmes for American teenagers with Holmes' ""woman"" Irene Adler shoe-horned in.There are action scenes galore, some of them are decently staged but this is not a Holmes story.I went in with low expectations and my worst fears were realised.A better disappointment.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Good Movie Overall,"A bit hard to follow but towards the end it clears up, a good quick wit whirlwind adventure full of dark humor and a very clean movie. The director did s good job with the cast Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law do an excellent job together. For me this movie was up there with Avatar. This movie went almost completely with the book and I left the movie theater wanting the DVD. I am impressed with how clean this movie is little or no sexuality whatsoever and little or no cussing. I read that Percy Jackson and the Olympians had more sexuality and cussing that left me woefully disappointed. It was supposed to be a FAMILY movie Sherlock Holmes was much better than that and the only reason I gave it a nine was because it was a tiny bit hard to follow. It even has music by a much better composer Hans Zimmer who is simply amazing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Robert Downey Jr. is AMAZING!,"Robert Downey Jr. delivers just as everyone knew that he would. He has to be considered the greatest actor working today now that DeNiro and Pacino are past their prime. (No offense to Al & Bob) Cast anyone else in the lead and this film isn't as good nor as interesting. Most of the presentation works, especially the internal monologue of Holmes' actions and deductions. The director does display a self important heavy hand in some scenes but it never takes away from the overall enjoyment of the movie. Rachel McAdams is woefully underused but sets up nicely for the sequel. I'm glad the film is doing well because to see Downey's Holmes lock horns with his greatest adversary is what the cinema is for. Let the casting begin!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Robert Downey saved this film!,"Lots of action and lots of twists. That said, truth be told Robert Downey saved this film. Without Mr. Downey, this film would have been a 3 , if not a 4. This film was a silly film that went all over the place. Granted there were some twists here and there. For the most part though, this film was aimless. Wonderful costume, wonderful cinematography and lots of action , still without Downey this was a surefire dud. The actors were at best ho hum and the American actors, Downey excluded of course, were horrible when it came to Brit accents.Yes I enjoyed this film . My tip of the hat goes to Robert Downey for bringing this film to an acceptable rating. I believe the other actors in this film, including the overrated Jude Law, should cede their salaries to Mr. Downey.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
A new conception of Sherlock Holmes,"In this film, Sherlock Holmes and his adventure companion Dr. Watson, face the threat of a occult master who has been executed for several murders but, mysteriously, comes back to life. I confess that I am not a particular Sherlock Holmes fan. I read Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's tales and stories and found them interesting, but I always preferred other authors. However, I decided to watch this film and give it a chance, since it is a character that is rarely seen in cinema.I have to confess that the famous series ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"", from the mid-eighties, marked my way of imagining the characters. In this series, Jeremy Brett brought the detective to life in a way that, I think, is the closest to the author's original conception, and the most in line with the Victorian gentleman. This film, however, shows us a very modern Sherlock Holmes in his way of acting, speaking and behaving. The character acts like someone of our time, in a dissonant historical period, creating an anachronism. However, surprisingly, it did not affect me. I'm not a fan of anachronisms and I often criticize period films because of that, but the way this film was conceived made it acceptable.In fact, this film is not an adaptation of any of the original books or tales, it just take advantage of the characters and creates a new story with some adventure, action and even a supernatural scent much to the Victorian taste. If this film were an adaptation of any of Conan Doyle's stories, I think the director - an unlikely Guy Ritchie - would not have that freedom.Guy Ritchie would never be my first choice to direct a film like this. Against all my expectations, he proved to be more skilled and intelligent than in any of his other works (at least, those I know). I appreciated some of his options, like the dissonance between the period and the characters' attitudes or the use of slow motion sometimes. However, the film relies heavily on the quality and performance of the two main actors. Robert Downey Jr. is in the best moment of his career and it was a safe bet to bring a bold Holmes to life, closer to an action figure with a hint of mad genius than to a pure intellectual who analyses facts coldly. Jude Law, who brought Dr. Watson to life, is just as good and both are excellent when working together. Law's Watson, by the way, remains, as it always has been, more conventional and cautious than its companion, making a pleasant counterpoint to the main character. In the supporting cast, Mark Strong is a charismatic villain and Rachel McAdams gives additional support when its needed, but it has been largely underused.Technically, it is a film that uses and abuses CGI, green screen, visual and sound effects of quite regular quality, without anything extraordinary. It is something common in a film designed to be a blockbuster. The action and fight scenes were well done but they are not breathtaking. The cinematography tried to be darker, perhaps as a result of our idea of Victorian London as a misty and humid city. This worked fine most of the time but there are moments when it was too much. Post-production and editing was regular and the soundtrack, by Hans Zimmer, was not as successful as many others by the same composer. At least to me, it sounded too much like a sailors song.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Visually magnificent,"78/100. Impressive feel for the era it was set in, absolutely amazing art direction. The camera-work is also impressive and inventive as well. Great costume design. The score is amazingly good and contributes very much to the films success. I am not a big fan of Robert Downey Jr., but he is quite good. Jude Law gives his best performance in years. The humor in the film is welcome and used appropriately. Fine supporting cast. Sometimes it does go a bit over the top and I don't feel that it is true to the original stories. I don't think Guy Ritchie was the best choice to direct, his style isn't best suited to a film of this nature. Overall the movie is remarkable, and is worth watching for the visuals alone.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Up to date but true to legend,"I first came across Sherlock Holmes when my Dad brought me a present from a trip he had been on.It was a Complete Sherlock Holmes Volume. I was about 10 and very disappointed. About a year later I was bored so I tried reading it. I was absolutely entranced and gripped by the stories and read them again and again. I have seen a few movies and tried the TV series but although not awful they were not satisfying. I had no great hopes of Guy Ritchie's entry into this particular ring. An American playing Holmes? Even if it were Robert Downey Jr (whom I love as an actor)? Well, dear readers, it works superbly. Downey and Law are a charismatic pairing and the movie is just about as good as it could be. Such energy is brought to the story , it carries the viewer along at a tremendous pace. The whole depiction of Victorian London looks and feels right and is as much of a character as any of the actors. The supporting actors themselves are more than up to the job too - Mark Strong's villain is imposing, dark and menacing - but then he is a fantastic actor and he too would have made for an interesting Holmes, in my opinion. Eddie Marsan always gives good value and his Lestrade fitted right in. I would have liked to have seen the pace slowed a little from time to time so I could take a breath, but that is nitpicking. An excellent venture and I and my wife look forward to the next one. A wonderful achievement by all.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

Ritchie continues to impress,"Guy Ritchie has made three fine action/comedy films since 1998, starting with Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, and RocknRolla (I still need to see his 2005 film Revolver). He has a distinct style of film-making using slow motion, flashbacks, pauses, heavy British, Scottish, and Irish accents, and like many fine filmmakers of the day, a very strong musical soundtrack. With the exception of Swept Away, he tends to focus on the British underworld of gangsters, hit men, and junkies. He is quite good at telling these stories and one would naturally think that his next venture would be along those same lines.Then came Sherlock Holmes.I wasn't completely on board with this one. After seeing the film, I can confidently say that I am on board for this one.Robert Downey Jr. plays the famous British private detective. Along with him is his faithful sidekick Dr. Watson, played by Jude Law who steals the movie for me. He was by far the biggest surprise. I wasn't all over the idea of changing the somewhat reserved character of Dr. Watson into a rough and tough soldier turned doctor. I couldn't have been more wrong.We find Holmes and Watson fowling up the plans of Lord Blackwood, a powerful man who dabbles in the dark arts. Following his execution, Dr. Watson decides it is time to leave his partner and settle down with his wife to be. Sherlock has his qualms about the separation from his faithful assistant, but those are brushed aside when reports of Lord Blackwood rising from the grave start circulating. With Holmes back on the case, he does everything he can to get Watson back on the job with him.Like I said, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. I didn't think Ritchie's modern style would translate well to this story. What makes it work is his use of modern camera techniques and special effects to help bring to life the legend of Sherlock Holmes. The fight scenes are backed up by some period inspired music and the costume design, art direction, and set design all contribute in creating the right atmosphere for the story.Like I said earlier, Law played a very different yet favorable Watson. Downey Jr. was not perfect for the role but his accent was first rate and I especially liked his voice overs when he would play out a situation in his head before it would happen (although some of the credit goes to Ritchie and the editing department). The rest of the cast was fine, though I wasn't completely sold on McAdams in her role.There isn't anything groundbreaking about this one, just a fun movie with a cool story. It's blatantly obvious that Ritchie intends to make a sequel regardless of the box office revenue (which should be enough to call for a sequel), though he set up RocknRolla for a sequel and I'm not sure if that is going to happen any time soon. I hope it does, but I think he needs another Sherlock Holmes movie to go through and then take some time to work on a good story for a RocknRolla sequel.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
much better than I expected,"After watching the trailers and reading some comments, I was actually expecting a mindless action movie that has nothing to do with Holmes. But it turned out to be quite wrong. The movie is very nice and it is actually reflecting Holmes as much as possible. It is not a Doyle story but there is nothing contradicts with the Holmes portrait by Doyle. There is some action but it is nothing exaggerated and the dialogs are satisfactorily crafted in an intelligent and logical way. The sense of rationalism what is the main part of the character Holmes is always there. The only part I found strange was the involvement of Irene Adler. In the original series, she had a different role in the whole story. Also, Holmes is supposed have an accent but it was simply not there. Nevertheless, much better than I expected.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
A roll along adventure with a different take on the legendary crime fighting figure.,"I for one was never a die hard Holmes fan, yet over the years as a kid I would on occasion read some of the literature of the legendary figure. As seen here director Guy Ritchie who had a much different take on Sherlock showing him more as an action and karate fighting warrior who still has crime solving skills. Anyway it's setting is in typical fashion of 1880's London you find Holmes(in a bold and fun performance from Robert Downey Jr.)as a mysterious master of disguise and clue sniffing problem solver who leaps out of buildings and fights crime with his bare knuckles just like an action super hero. In a good yet whimsical supporting role is Sherlock's good friend and sidekick Dr. Watson(Jude Law)as both carry on like old classmates, yet still serious they both have one goal in common and that's to rid London of the evil and mysterious magical Lord Blackwood(Mark Strong).Along the way this is a film of fun fighting thrill ride chases and fun entertainment even though it seems a little exhausting as this take on Holmes shows him more of a brutal and intense brawler than as expected the norm of a book solving wizard. Introduced as an interesting thorn to the film is an ex love of Holmes that is Irene Adler(Rachel McAdams)who's a sneaky and manipulative dame in such an old fashioned Victorian way that you don't know if to take her as a good princess or evil witch type. Overall this film isn't the best I've seen yet it's explosive pace makes it a franchise because the character is enriched in great storytelling and history so this film is certainly the start of something special so enjoy it's new look and clever ways of an iconic mystery fighting figure.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle Transmogrified by Guy Ritchie,"SHERLOCK HOLMES a la Guy Ritchie - seems like a non sequitur, but the trade off of Doyle's cerebral manner with Ritchie's visceral visual version makes for a very interesting if at times frustrating film. The rather silly screen story was hatched by Lionel Wigram and Michael Robert Johnson (who also penned the screenplay in tandem with Anthony Peckham and Simon Kinberg) and despite the general lack of resemblance of Ritchie's concept of a messy, hygiene-challenged sot of a Holmes (as portrayed by Robert Downey, Jr) the overall result is a Victorian London come alive in a richly colorful way. Jude Law is placed in the shoes of Dr. Watson and makes them fit despite the original's more dignified persona. And the ever present quintessential evil - Professor Moriarty - becomes a rather excessively far-fetched immortal presence of Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong), his accomplice is one Lord Coward (Hans Mathesen). Rachel Mc Adams adds to the flavor of Ritchie's kickboxing fast forward fighting Irene Adler, and Watson's affianced Mary Morstan is a look-quickly-before-she- disappears Kelly Reilly.To be fair much of the original smart and sharp witted conversations and mind-workings of Holmes have been preserved: the dialog of the author's style comes in quickly delivered digressions amongst the explosions and CGI effects. The film is a long song and may lose a few to nodding off before the final credits, but stay awake if you can, because the artwork of the credits is startlingly fine!Grady Harp",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Great setup, but unsatisfying","To say Sherlock Holmes had high expectations is an understatement. Lets face it, Guy Ritche post-RocknRolla directing Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law, along with his pet actor (and sole reason to watch Revolver) Mark Strong, not to mention Rachel McAdams. So when Holmes wound up being merely good, it was really easy to be disappointed.Holmes takes on a more book-accurate version, which is great. Holmes is far from stable, an eccentric nutbag, although brilliant (its easy to see that House was based off this version of Sherlock). The biggest difference is Dr. Watson, who, by being played by Jude Law, is immediately obviously not the bumbling fatman following Holmes as one might expect. Instead, he's competent and possibly the only one able to save Holmes from himself.The pair soon finds themselves in the middle of a mystery and Lord Blackwood (Strong), a villainous leader of a cult group, seemingly comes back from the dead and begins offing his cult elders, who all believe in some heebie-jeebie stuff the movies takes way to seriously and is only able to explain through outlandish means. Strong has proved himself a good actor, but fails as the villain, not using his screen presence as much as he could.Rachel McAdams also appears as Holmes' long-lost love interest and femme fatale, although she eventually must take on the damsel in distress role. She perhaps lacks some of the more direct sex appeal, but is nonetheless effective in the role.As for the main pair, they are both played excellent. Robert Downey Jr is possibly the best possible actor to play an eccentric like Holmes, and Law complements him very well.The movie has many more action setpieces than one might expect from the title, but alas, they are there. And they are quite good, especially when they invoke a certain monstorous mook. Ritchie directs them with plenty of kinetic energy without getting too Bourne-ish, but they do sometimes go too far over the top.In all, Holmes is an entertaining but unsatisfying end-of-year action flick. It desperately wants a sequel, which I hope it gets simply because there is lots of potential. Here's hoping Ritchie utilises it more next time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Really fun, supercharged, within spec, worth seeing...","...if only to see for yourself whether the objections were justified.I've read quite a few of the SH stories and a couple of the novels, and have stayed at the Sherlock Holmes Hotel in London on Baker Street, which is peppered with memorabilia from perhaps a century ago. Another seeding of my impressions of what SH should look and act like are of course the Granada television series starring the late Jeremy Brett. Everyone does different things with the characters and adapting the stories, and Ritchie's interpretation-- along with some decent acting-- are quite valid and within plausibility of the legendary yet fictional character's representation.In fact, aside from being initially dismayed at (untrue) reports of anachronistic or non-canonical fighting scenes, the only things which made me wonder why the movie dared to include something which I didn't see fit, was that I hadn't read the SH story which might have explained or justified the inclusion!The film was enjoyable and had a mystery to be solved, a few false leads to make it unpredictable, excellent cinematography and direction, crackling dialogue, a great transformation in portrayal as seen by Eddie Marsan and even Jude Law's mustache, seemingly authentic costuming, and a better use of Watson than as a dopey version of Ed McMahon (as we're used to seeing) or as a device to convey exposition to the audience-- which was done in another way.Very well-crafted action movie with a cerebral, literary, and historical edge. Not offensive to SH fans, unless there's a bad pedantic apple in the bunch: I'm glad my friends' word-of-mouth trumped the trollerific nay-saying of the Great Unwashed & convinced me to see it.

Behold the Made over Holmes,"""It was very superficial, my dear Watson, I assure you"" Remember this line from 'The Cardboard Box'? This seems to be the most pertinent and to the point review of the new movie Sherlock Holmes. The quick witted and masterful Holmes breaks all the shackles of his past and is reincarnated as the new Holmes, the Dark Knight of the future. He is eccentric, enigmatic and visually too cinematic to be the pipe smoking, aquiline nosed detective we all read about. The inhabitant of 221B Baker Street turns all clichéd notions upside down with his fist fights and his potent love interest in his enemy turned ally, Irene Adler. Holmes is the Iron Man who like all superheroes fights and kills his adversaries. The intriguing plot meanders heroically as its protagonists; the brave-heart Holmes and the overpowered Watson try to outwit the dark lord, Lord Blackwood whose malicious and occult crimes threaten to annihilate the peace of London.Robert Downey Junior is brilliant in his role, he is funny and entertaining. His accent is masterful and his gait dainty. He is however a little more disheveled than expected, lurking around his room catching flies and anesthetizing Watson's dog. But his mental acumen is strong, his reflective brain, his ability to deduce a person's character from the minuscule details brings to mind the character of the dear old Holmes. However his colleague Dr. Watson seemed at times more potent than him, solving riddles in a jiffy, romanticizing and even overshadowing Holmes at some parts. Jude Law is an actor par excellence and he has used his skill to the best of his ability thereby creating a made over Dr. Watson whom I simply loved. The colleagues share a fantastic bond; they are the ideal made for each other couple. In those grimy and grumpy scenes of slaughterhouse blood, dirty alleys and soiled laboratory, it is obviously the fantastic bond between these two that win over audiences with its charm.Irene Adler who is first mentioned in 'The Scandal in Bohemia' and who is possibly the love interest of our old Holmes is resurrected here. She is a charming young lady of style, class and brawn. We never know if Mr. Holmes really loved her since ""All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind."" But in the cinema the emotion of love is more potent and discreet. They kiss and hug yet they always engage in a battle of wits. Holmes has the picture of Adler (the one mentioned in 'The Scandal in Bohemia') and he seems to adore and admire the lady. Rachel McAdams looks good in all the scenes but there is a missing ingredient in her chemistry with Holmes. They don't look like a great match, even though they try hard to portray the perfection, they just don't seem to hit it. As for the other characters, Mark Strong as Lord Blackwood is both sinister and perfect. He combined the villainous instincts of a gentleman with great dexterity.The storyline of the movie is admirable. The plot is fabulous and will leave you agog. One will definitely not find the flair of Conan Doyle, but he will surely enjoy the twists and turns. The cinematography is brilliant. The gloomy London skies cast a gray shadow in the movie. The movie has a dearth of color and the sequences are frenetic, fast and slow paced at the same time. The soundtrack is soothing, a little Irish but good to ears.Overall, the movie was a brilliant and innovative experiment for director Guy Richie. The peppy Sherlock Holmes does look marvelous on screen yet somehow he lacks the appeal and the wisdom of the stereotyped Holmes and becomes a usual Guy Richie creation, perhaps just another extraordinary antihero.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
The movie is good,"The very only thing that was off in the movie was the confrontational aspect of Watson, who in the book normally accepts pretty much anything Holmes sends his way, but it wasn't done in a way that was unpleasant, and other than that, the movie was surprisingly good and far closer to the books than previous adaptations.In fact, I have a theory that quite often, when people say this movie is ""not faithful to the spirit of the books"", the person saying that hasn't read the books in a good 20 years, barely remembers them, and is a fan of one of the previous adaptations, which are often quite far from the book. As a result, no wonder that they'd have a different view of it.you can watch it online at: http://www.inspiring-movies.com/sherlock-holmes-2009-full-hd- 1080-720",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

Guy Ritchie points out, that he is truer to the source material (the books) by his depictions of Holmes and Watson.

It's interesting watching these films in reverse order.,"I can see now how A Game of Shadows would have been a disappointment, a more hollow shell, paying off none of the nuances and plot lines built up in the first entry in favour of a poppy, zippy, slight action thriller. This first film is actually surprisingly funny, the RDJ/Jude Law witty repartee is completely enjoyable and both parties are genuinely enjoying themselves and giving their all. It's a messier film, in a good way, it looks messier and RDJ plays a pleasurable bellend. Ritchie for all his flaws can manufacture a competently enjoyable blockbuster with enough visual wit and clarity and there aren't too many memorable steampunky Victorian action comedies so this stands out significantly.
I'm not a fan of the occult plot and en vogue Mark Strong sinister moustache twirling villain, but it seems suitably Conan-Doyle-esque and on rewatching it, it seems to be a fitting backdrop to the reinvention of these famous characters.
Little quirks like Holmes' kit bag, his sensible combat style and Watson's appropriately Victorian postmortem skills, are all fun little moments in a story about the end of a friendship, which is a natty place to start a franchise.

"The Best...um...""James Bond"" Film I've Seen in a Long Time","I enjoyed ""Sherlock Holmes,"" as much for its preposterous-ness as its visual style. I'm pleased that Guy Ritchie was able to make a halfway-decent movie.As a fan of the Granada TV series, I know that no one will ever equal Jeremy Brett's performance as the greatest detective. But I wasn't expecting Robert Downey, Jr. to equal it, any more than I was expecting this movie to be the best ""Sherlock"" movie ever.Downey is ""Sherlock Holmes"" in name only. He bears a few resemblances to Conan Doyle's eccentric detective (with emphasis on the ""eccentric""). Like a hyperactive child, he prances around the streets of London, drunk on his own genius.In truth, Downey's Holmes is more like a self-employed Victorian James Bond (the Roger Moore version). Like Bond, Downey's Holmes bungles his way through his adventures, fights the bad guys with martial arts, uncovers the secret plots, jumps out of windows, and escapes death traps usually by tripping over them and setting them off. His genius intellect and acute powers of observation sometimes get in the way of his solving the case.And like Bond, he usually picks the ""femme fatale"" to romance (in this case, the jewel thief Irene Adler, played by Rachel Mc Adams). As with Bond, the ""femme fatale"" romance often gets Downey's Holmes into compromising positions and embarrassing situations. And of course, as with Bond, the ""femme fatale"" comes over to Holmes's side before the end of the movie.This time around, however, it's the bad guys who have the Q devices. Holmes's nemesis is Lord Blackwell (Mark Strong), head of a SPECTRE-like society that plans to conquer the world using black magic (or something like it). And they have fiendish doomsday devices at their disposal to do so, devices that Holmes must dismantle and occasionally explain to the audience.Another nemesis (I won't reveal who) seems to be lurking in the shadows, observing Holmes from a distance. We see only his hat and his long black coat, with his gloved hands resting on the head of a cane...We never see his face. All that's missing is a white Persian cat sitting on his lap.(On a personal note, I should have known who this character would turn out to be. But based on the fact that you couldn't see his face, I almost thought it was Jack Griffin, the Invisible Man.) There are a few Bond-ian scenes, such as the confrontation of the villain in his secret hideout, where the villain reveals his dastardly plan to Holmes, rather than shooting him. And there is a scene late in the movie where Holmes and Watson must penetrate an impenetrable fortress to foil the villain's scheme.And of course, there are the usual shaky-cam shots, hyper-cut editing, and fantastic CGI backgrounds and visual effects that are what passes for style in a modern action movie. How much do you want to bet that the climactic fight between Holmes and Blackwell will take place on top of a well-known London monument high in the air? James Bond would have approved.Mention should be given to Jude Law as Dr. Watson, the man who most often gets Holmes out of trouble, and who is used to his eccentricities. They gave Watson a fiancé, of course, so that the Holmes/Watson relationship would not seem too ""gay."" But they had the sense to make Watson an intelligent man who can follow Holmes's observations and reasonings, and come to the same conclusions -- just not as fast as Holmes. The curse of the slow-witted Nigel Bruce Watson has been buried forever.So that's it. Holmes as Bond. Ridiculous, but enjoyable. I guess we shouldn't be surprised. I'm looking forward to the next film in the franchise. Again, I'm glad Guy Ritchie had at least one good film in him. I hope he can make another.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Downey Walked so the BBC Could Run (🖥, 💙)","I'll say it, I really liked the BBC Sherlock series, I feel it's the natural evolution of this film. This movie is a great portrayal of the classic character, and brings him to life in a very engaging way. Though for as good as the character is, I had trouble following the mystery. Maybe I'm dumb, but much of the movie felt like vague and unconnected until Holmes put it together in the end. Perhaps that's the point though, seeing him put everything together. Either way, the action is good, the humor is decent, and the mystery is great.It's no Holmes & Watson though 👀",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

Completely unwatchable,"The movies that I have most enjoyed most are the ones that I went to see with very little advance knowledge. With that in mind, and with good memories of performances by Robert Downey Jr., I avoided the reviews and trailers for ""Sherlock Holmes"", and went to see it this afternoon.This time, I wish I had taken just a little time to get familiar with it beforehand. What a crock. Bad from the opening scenes. When reading more about it here on IMDb, I realized, it's probably because of Guy Ritchie.I really feel sorry for Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law. They have each been in some good movies, but this time, we walked out after an hour.There was nothing wrong with the idea of updating Holmes, showing a more physical or emotional side, compared to the dry, almost emotionless way that he's usually been portrayed. In a couple of scenes, I thought, he reminds me of Dr. Gregory House, from the TV show ""House MD"". That would have been an interesting treatment, if it had been consistent or well done. But this was a totally wasted effort, by all concerned.UPDATE: Reading some other reviews, I should add that the costumes and sets were great. But they weren't enough to counterbalance the ludicrous, confusing mess that is the rest of the production.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Loved Downey Hated McAdams,"I could watch Robert Downey Jr. all day. Those chocolate brown eyes (70% cacao) grab me and hypnotize. Even his wrinkles and crags are interesting. And while I know the magic of the silver screen smooths out the many imperfections of age, whatever it is – his looks, disease, insanity, talent – whatever it is, I love to watch it. Downey as Sherlock Holmes, another drug addicted, crazed, brilliant and erratic creature, is a perfect fit. I didn't even think about Basil Rathbone, whose Sherlock Holmes was equally, though differently, inspired. Rathbone's Holmes emphasized the analytical, precise, cerebral and obsessive genius while Downey went with an intense, physical, neurotic, humorous and homo-erotic Sherlock Holmes. Both were brilliant.As John Watson (His first name is John?) Jude Law comes off reasonably well as the adoring and put-upon sidekick, though he doesn't dazzle as Downey does. His good looks are tamped down and he only occasionally entices with a twinkle from his razor sharp blue eyes. The love story between them, whether platonic or consummated, is an engaging development, absent from earlier portrayals of a dowdy Watson and almost asexual Holmes. This Holmes' interest in Watson is even more understandable when compared to his other option, Irene Adler as played by Rachel McAdams. What Hollywood forgot, or didn't care to acknowledge, is that Holmes loves Adler because she is as bright, deviant and intriguing as he is himself. McAdams' Adler does not reach this level. That McAdams/Adler is beautiful – and I don't recall if Adler is in the books – is secondary. Adler is the mysterious lost love of Holmes' tortured past. Here, McAdams looks like a precocious teenager, in make up and grown up clothes without a line on her face. Every time she opens her mouth, it is a tiny, flat, little girl's voice. – no richness, no depth, no deceit – no interest. It seems the only thing Hollywood directors want from their women performers is a tight butt – and this, of course, McAdams does have. Difficult to miss in her painted on pinstripe trousers. Maybe that's all Holmes wanted after all, a nice piece ofmmmm. No. Hollywood prefers to infantilize its women and usually, since their roles are little more than sex props for the men, no one cares. Every male actor over 40 must have a contract clause requiring a sex scene with a virginal actress. Downey passes in this film, which was odd until I noticed Susan Downey is a producer. Mystery solved. Anyway, McAdams comes across as an ingénue not a woman of cunning and experience. A love interest between Holmes and Adler on screen required something more than McAdams had to give.Kelly Reilly does better as Watson's love Mary Morstan. She has some fire in her. As the sidekick's lover, she's allowed to be less attractive than Adler and therefore can show a little personality. Her shame, then disgust at Holmes's revelations about her past is compelling, unfolding in her few moments of screen time. The movie is better for it.The villain Lord Blackwood is a one dimensional foil for the heroes. However, Mark Strong is elegant and sinister here – a vampire bent on destruction – so he provides what's needed. I spent the whole movie thinking the villain was played by Stanley Tucci, who is a great actor so the comparison is a complement. Then I found out it was Strong, who, I've never heard of. Now that I know who he is, I'll look for Strong next time in astronger role.Neither Downey nor McAdams do well with an English accent, while Law's and the supporting casts' are naturally excellent. Downey's accent is passable to American ears but would never fool a Brit. At least he isn't jarringly American. Downey consistently drops his R's and breathes into his A's in a passing attempt to keep up the pretense. McAdams is noticeably worse as her speech breaks the mood of old England - her R's are as flat and hard as those of a New Jersey waitress.The Special Effects are, as Mr. Rogers would say, special. Everything exploding, catching on fire, dropping into the river, the cameras twirling around; they are fantastic. Still, the scene that stays with me is Downey moving his face in and out of several pillars, stalking, hiding, teasing his nemesis as his eyes suck us in with a tidal pull.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Enjoyable, Different, Something New For Sherlock...","So, Sherlock Homes from 2009 is very different. Compared to other crime movies or movies from the Sherlock Holmes universe, this one has something new to offer. I liked it, but some of the things I didn't like. We got all of the classic characters, a villain, and a great plot. It was well written, the dialogues were clever and funny, and overall it was a fun ride. The only thing that annoyed me was that we knew who the murder was from the beginning, that was very annoying, because in Sherlock Holmes movies you are supposed to try to guess or find out who the murder is. In this movie, you knew it from beginning to the end, but you didn't know how the murder did so terrible things. You know, that was kind of the downside, but it was still a fun experience. The action sequences were great. Great planned and they was complete. A lot of slow motion and fast motion between the action scenes, that I think was very cool. Great acting and the scenography was dark and I liked it. If you like Sherlock Holmes, this is an ok movie to watch. If you like murder mysteries, this is not a movie for you, if you like action and Holmes, I think you may have a great experience.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
really outlandish solutions to mysteries...,"sums up this movie. Holmes really comes up with some unbelievable answers, but if you can get over that, this movie was OK. The part that didn't work was all the kick @ss fighting Holmes and Watson do because I don't think that was really in the books.Downey was good as usual and Law was passable since he wasn't playing his usual character. Rachel Mcadams should have turned this role down because her character has very little to do and she was pretty much pointless through out the film. Considering you know Holmes is famous for figuring out impossible mysteries, it's safe to assume Lord Blackwood really isn't using supernatural powers. You just have to wait till the end for Holmes to give his ridiculous rant to how he did it all and fooled everyone.FINAL VERDICT: It was better than I expected, mainly because Robert Downey, Jr is so good. It's worth a viewing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Guy Ritchie's best effort,"I have always been fascinated with Sherlock Holmes and I was not disappointed with Guy Ritche's effort. Ritchie has had my attention since ""Snatched"". If you have not seen it, watch it without kids. It is as violent as they get. His version of Sherlock reflects his style of a movie but he worked hard to get it right. The movie has potential to be one of the few that are worth see several times. It is clear Law and Downing enjoy working together.The action is fast and the effects are believable. Downing is totally immersed as Holmes. Of course some think they are one and the same. Downing is the only one who pull off role. This is not a kid's movie. The movie makes you think and wonder about all the possibilities it brings. It has been awhile since a movie has made me feel this way. If you like mind twister go see it. I would love to see a Holmes 2 in the future.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
I actually liked the bit of modern feel going for this...It wasn't ridiculous and added a bit of flare to it,"Some audiences has been bashing on this movie because it has that bit of a modern feel going for it. And I personally liked the modern feel to this movie, despite the time period this movie takes place. It just didn't seem like it went this direction because of the majority of audiences but because this added a bit of flare to it. Without it ruining the original books while reaching out to the mass audiences. This is a big case that Sherlock is trying to solve and a interesting one for the most part although it can be predictable at times. It isn't the most articulate and intelligent case ever, but it's decent. And just about anyone can understand exactly what is going on. Robert Downey Jr. was good as Sherlock Holmes although over-exaggerated at times and Jude Law was likable as Watson. They have a bit of a bromance going but they make a great duo and it's entertaining to watch them work together. Mark Strong does what he does best, playing a charismatic villain. Rachel McAdams is cute but she didn't really seem to fit her role as Irene Adler, she just seemed more girly than a seductive thief. She wasn't bad but just didn't seem to suit the role she is given all that well. When it came to Sherlock I enjoyed watching how he constantly used his senses and intuition using his surroundings and environment to get closer to finding out what is going on. Anyways to sum it up this movie has style but also has a bit of substance as well, it has enough action and mystery to keep the mass audiences entertained.7.7/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Fantastic art and dialogue,"I would have given the movie a 9 but for the previous post giving a 1.>>Quck Rant<< Its a shame that when Hollywood does actually green light a great movie featuring one of America's few genius actors that someone thinks it TERRIBLE??? really, terrible....Sad to see a person that's so much of a dolt who can't keep up with a script that moves quickly, therefore run to the only thing their slow minds are capable of... spewing boring drivel and convincing themselves they are so terribly smart.Anyway...What a great movie!! filled with beautiful artwork of Victorian London, Dark, richly colored cinematography, Lively music, a rich broth of characters and a plot filled with surprises.After reading many reviews here, I learned about the creation, unfortunate re-working and finally, bringing to life of the real Sherlock Holmes' character.

The very small facial nuances, the mannerisms, the physicality of the character's fight scenes... absolutely fantastic.I am keeping my review short as to not give anything away... and there are many excellent, detailed reviews here already.If you haven't seen the movie please get the HD version and enjoy the richness of this great comical adventure.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

This is not Sherlock Holmes,"This movie ain't about Sherlock Holmes, but some pathetic Holmes wannabe. More like a Jacques Clouseau movie than a Holmes movie. Also Jude Law is just the wrong person to cast as Dr. Watson, no matter how charming he is, he's just not Watson, period.In Summary:The ""Sherlock Holmes"" played by Robert Downey Jr tries hard to be characteristic but failswhereas the real Sherlock Holmes from the book IS effortless characteristic.Enough said.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
A new refreshing look at the ageless figure of Sherlock Holmes,"Do I like fast-paced and mischievous style of Guy Ritchie's films? Am I charmed and amazed by the incredible deduction of Sherlock Holmes? Well, yes and yes! Seeing these two names put together and on top of that reading the list of cast members made me lose all my calm and squeal as a piglet smelling a juicy carrot.Right from the start mysterious villain calls out Robert Downey Jr. to prove his skills in acting, fighting and radiation of immediate charisma. Together with Jude Law they make an unbelievably good duo. Many times already we have seen a crime fighting couple that balances itself: crazy smart Holmes with precise and calculated Watson, but the manner they handle themselves is incredibly charming and the style is impeccable.The plot stands out with its outstanding logic and moments of almost inhuman wit and fastness of thinking of Sherlock Holmes. Guy Ritchie's vision has helped us to admire the skills of unorthodox detective with far more drive than all the versions before. The nonlinearity of storyline keeps your mind working and the tension never drops to the point of boredom.Don't get me started on the music. Hans Zimmer once again delivered the soundtrack that reflects the character and the events to the point where they merge into one, engulfing viewers and taking them away from reality right into the action.Summing up the observations I would say that the movie is definitely worth your attention.

Sherlock Holmes Review: Great adaptation of a British character,"Some people feel that as Sherlock Holmes (2009) will not achieve that of previous adaptations of the Conan Doyle novels. However this film lives up to other Sherlock Holmes creations, if not excelling them. Robert Downey Jr. plays the eccentric and witty Sherlock in a very Captain Jack style way, but this acting approach is perfect for the character of Sherlock Holmes in a modern audiences view.The story is well written, with some funny puns, some directed at a young audience, some at an older one. But which ever jokes make you laugh that doesn't matter as the plot keeps you wondering how Lord Blackwood carries out his dastardly deeds throughout the story of the film. The film is then summed up with a classic Sherlock Holmes, or any other murder story/screenplay, with him ""spilling the beans"" on how he figured out the crime.I went into the film having doubts over it because although the concept was interesting, the fact that Guy Ritchie was directing it made me worry about the films style and success. But it seems that Sherlock Holmes is actually the least ""Guy Ritchie"" movie that Guy Ritchie has made, this may be down to the script not having been written by him. But either way, I left this film pleased and excited for a sequel.

"Sherlock Holmes looked dumb, but I watched it and Loved it.","When I saw the trailers for this film and I saw all the fight scenes I instantly thought they had ruined the movie, because for me, thats not how I saw Sherlock Holmes (as some pit fighter).I like the two actors Downey Jr. and Law, but I couldn't get over the fight scenes.Well then I saw the film, like 2 years after it came out.I loved it. Everything about it. But for me mainly, I loved how damn funny the film was, I found myself cracking up every 5 minutes or so, it really was that funny. It was smart, quirky and yes those fight scenes are totally explained and fall perfectly within the Sherlock Holmes mythology.The film had a great theme as well that most of my Sherlock Holmes experience had, and that was; there was always a battle between the supernatural versus Holmes' logic and reason.If you felt the same as me and were stand-offish with the film because you may have felt they betrayed the mythology....WATCH IT.

Brawn Over Brains,"I guess I've just got too much Basil Rathbone in my idea of Sherlock Holmes; suave, sophisticated, brilliant, imaginative, creative and always a step ahead. Throw in that certain hat, tweed jacket and subtle humor and you've got the man from 221B Baker Street. For that matter, several other ""Holmes"" both in older times and more recent have captured that essence and symbiotic relationship with good old Dr. Watson. What we've got here is a total re-interpretation of a good thing, to the point of making this an action adventure instead of a psychological who-dunnit of old.For my money, Robert Downey Jr. doesn't cut it as Holmes much as he tries-he reminds me too much of Charlie Chaplin. He's short, squatty and feigns to be a brawny muscle figure in this adaptation. The relationship with Holmes is never quite developed and the chemistry isn't there as it should be, nor is the humor. Frankly, if I want a technology driven action/adventure I wouldn't have sought this movie out. I'll go back to my set of Rathbone classics anytime, and I will tune in to the Jeremy Brett version as I've heard that is quite good as well. This particular Holmes doesn't strike me as Holmes at all-missing the essence by trying to remake something other than what it IS.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Before Batman, there was Sherlock Holmes.","Most people often dismiss Sherlock as a boring detective who speaks in rather complex sentences. Supposedly, that's not exactly how he is in the books as this film demonstrates. The filmmakers apparently revealed the detective's true colors as a hard hitting, resourceful, and deductive individual.Plot: Sherlock and his sidekick Dr. Watson find themselves on the trail of one of their toughest foes yet: Lord Blackwood. Blackwood claims that he has powers beyond human understanding and has plans that will shake the foundations of the world, but the undaunted Sherlock Holmes remains ever so persistent and will give any one of Blackwood's thugs that stand in his way a thorough beat down as he solves the unsolvable.Sherlock is like Batman in so many ways. He has a reliable sidekick (Watson, like Robin), he's skilled in hand-to-hand combat, he uses tools, and he analyzes things to the smallest detail. He does have his own unique twists, being manipulative and being slightly egotistical, which makes him very humorous. In fact, a lot of scenes that he shares with Watson tend to be pretty funny. The action scenes are awesome, often employing slow-motion and clever camera work. The mystery that surrounds Blackwood really messes with your mind and it makes you interested in how all this is done and what are the relations.Amazingly well done, this film is sure to entertain and beyond.

a flashy detective but London is the real focus,"According to my humble opinion the hero of this movie is the city of London, during Victorian or Edwardian times.The contradictions of prosperous clubs and industrial squalor, the affluence of the elite and the plight of the masses, all that in the canvas of the grey misty London sky and the amazingly alive if unclean river Thames form a very strong picture in the mind of a foreign viewer as myself.Truly the protagonist Holmes is of a more alternative version than the usually conservative English gentleman portrayed. He has an affair with a girl that is openly having illegal activities- is actually an international criminal- although a charming one.He gives rational explanations to the magical phaenomena of the movie- although I find them far-fetched and unconvincing- i liked the magical explanation better. He has marvellous powers of observation and stops a plot to overcome the British Empire- which is of course completely unbelievable in itself- as if a quack magician could hold sway over the mother of parliaments.Watson is the dependable Englishman, the sturdy English yeoman and is finely portrayed by Jude Law.Also MacAdams the actress plays with charm and gusto the seductive criminal whose love for Holmes makes her betray the criminal mastermind who controls her.Still, the most impressive feature is London: multifaceted, ubiquitous, rotten, foggy, splendid, dirty, miserable, inspiring, all at the same time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
A Classic Reimagined: Sherlock Holmes (2009) Was My Favorite Film of the 2000s,"Sherlock Holmes (2009) holds a special place in my heart, as it was my absolute favorite film when it first came out in the 2000s. Directed by Guy Ritchie, this modern reimagining of Arthur Conan Doyle's iconic detective feels both fresh and faithful, with its energetic style, sharp wit, and irresistible charisma. It was a movie that captivated me from the moment I saw it, blending mystery, action, and humor in a way that had me completely hooked.Robert Downey Jr. Brought a unique, eccentric energy to the role of Sherlock Holmes, a character known for his brilliance and aloofness. His portrayal was both intellectual and unpredictable, offering a fresh take on the classic detective. Alongside him, Jude Law's portrayal of Dr. John Watson perfectly complemented Downey Jr.'s Holmes, balancing humor with loyalty and adding emotional depth to their dynamic.What made Sherlock Holmes stand out for me was Guy Ritchie's signature direction. The film's fast-paced editing, clever dialogue, and stylish cinematography brought a modern edge to the Victorian setting, keeping it engaging and visually striking. The action sequences, especially the fight scenes, were exhilarating, with Holmes using his intellect to outthink and outmaneuver his opponents. It wasn't just about solving the mystery-it was about creating a thrilling cinematic experience.The film's plot, revolving around a sinister conspiracy and the looming threat of dark forces, was captivating, filled with twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my seat. As a fan of Sherlock Holmes, this movie felt like the perfect blend of old-school detective story and modern action thriller.Looking back, Sherlock Holmes was a game-changer for me. It was a film that redefined how I viewed adaptations, blending action with intellect and making me appreciate the complex relationship between Holmes and Watson even more. It was, without a doubt, my favorite film of the time and remains a standout in my cinematic history.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
I love to hate it,"I have been a devout fan of Mr Holmes' adventures almost since I could read, and I have great respect for the literature that is Sherlock Holmes. I loved the Jeremy Brett series and was apprehensive at the news of a Ritchie-Downey Jr Holmes flick. My fears were realized.I have nothing against reboots, I think they're a great movie-making technique, with excellent movies to back it up. However, the issue here is rebooting a literary text - and that is pretentious to say the least. Such disregard for the original material I have not seen in a long time and I wonder how far it will go.Notwithstanding: this is an excellent movie. Entertaining, well written and directed, I found myself liking it in spite of my disapproval of the treatment of Doyle's original. Definitely a must-see, even if you are an ultraconservative Sherlock fan such as myself.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Very Well Done,"I saw Sherlock Holmes for the first time after a long, exhilarating day of skiing up in the Berkshires. Accompanied by my parents and older brother, I had low expectations of what sounded like a tribute to some outdated book about a detective. The fact that my mother was itching to see this film meant that it was in a foreign dialect with subtitles, was about a tale of a forbidden love, or was done in black and white. I guess you could say ""family movies"" (in actuality whatever my mom wanted to see) didn't exactly have a positive connotation in my mind. My mom had her qualms about action-packed thrillers and films she reported were ""too unrealistic"".I'm not entirely sure what my mom was taking that day, but for whatever reason she actually chose a decent film. More than decent. The scary part is that I think she liked it, too. In fact I'm pretty sure this was the first film my entire family found entertaining, so much so that we've probably all seen it a good three or four times and made it our priority to see the second one.What was so good about Sherlock Holmes? Well I don't want to get into too many specifics, partly because I'm afraid I'll give something away, but mostly because I fear I've somehow muddled the first and second movies together and may make some comments that just aren't correct. It has to do with the pure genius of Robert Downey Jr.'s character. It is almost as if one is invited into the intricate abstractions of a most powerful mind within the very first scene. The whole audience gets to have the glory of feeling ""intellectual"" for the duration of two hours and eight minutes. Here we are met with a new superhero of sorts, one who relies entirely on his all-powerful mind. But he is not one of those bookworm geniuses caught reading in the library or wearing a lab coat, rather he is a man of intellect who relies on his intuition with all disregard for the law, or any obstacle, for that matter.Holmes leads an atypical lifestyle, rooming with Dr. Watson, fighting for profit, testing out inventions at his will, and having an uncanny knack for sizing people up at first appearance. His character is not one that is revered, rather sourly accepted. His sarcasm and disregard for ""being liked"" add comedy to the film and his casual manner in the way he goes about his investigation is complemented by his overwhelming arrogance.A man of such little care for the opinions of others would be nothing without his ""cher Watson"". Watson gives depth to the film, acting as Holmes' moral compass and best friend. What is a superhero without his trusty sidekick? Although in this case I might argue that Watson isn't actually his sidekick, and that the two share a corroborative relationship. Or maybe it's that Holmes is in fact subservient to Watson, but like an inquisitive dog, he begs for leash. When he gets that leash he runs off with it and is later brought back to heal when he finds that he is in a compromising situation. If you didn't see the movie you're probably perplexed by my analogy. Allow me to elaborate. Holmes has a certain distaste for doing what is publicly acceptable; he has a propensity to doing things such as insulting another or blowing cash away on a fight. Dr. Watson, on the other hand, plays the more respectable role of being a conscientious and hard worker within the boundaries of what is acceptable in society. Watson constantly advises Holmes on what not to do, but Holmes, being the egotistical outsider that he is, often dismisses Watson's pleading but often finds he is in need of the acclaimed Doctor's help. Watson's role is just as much that of a parent as a friend.Being invited into the world of Sherlock Holmes is being invited into a world of strategy, darkness, and a strikingly refreshing use of slow motion play-by-play action. The mystery in Sherlock Holmes isn't really the basis of the movie; it serves more as an added inquiry. It provokes the viewer to try and think ahead of the plot line, to solve what inevitably will be solved, and to try to beat out Sherlock Holmes.Of course there is some romance. The exchanges between Holmes and Irene Adler suggest a more than comfortable past between the two characters, which adds to the suspense throughout the film. Adler is a highly strong-minded feminist woman, a novel idea in nineteenth century London. She is independent and plays just as much the adversary of Holmes as she plays his infatuation. In contrast to society's belief of the woman as being the moral compass, Adler plays for the dark side, manipulating Holmes and asserting her valiance. By no means does her character conform to the general depiction of a nineteenth century ""lady"".The best scene in the film takes place rightly at the end. This is the summary of Holmes' findings and thought process, the point at which the crime unravels and the audience shares that final ""ahah"" moment, leaving the theater with the same satisfaction as if they had cracked the case themselves. The last scene is the one that wraps it all together, and the cliffhanger ending leaves one's mouth watering for more of the clever antics, complicated romance, scintillating action scenes, and ceaseless intrigue the perfect setup for a sequel.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Good film,"Mr. Ritchie provides us with quite a departure from the Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce ""Holmes and Watson"". Here we get dazzling special effects and near super-human feats and stunts. Another twist is that this Holmes here is no meticulous, fastidious bore in real life. In fact, he lives more like a frat boy or rock star - replete with trashed room and bouts of isolation.What is not missing is Holmes' world class attention to detail. The story here is multi-layered and actually very interesting, if not a bit high-minded and high-concept. The still-under-construction Tower Bridge plays a role in the film and the bleakness and gray of London is captured perfectly.Of course, I won't reveal any details of the story other than to say the ""good"" guys are out to get a real bad guy here ... wonderfully played by the always solid Mark Strong, who may or may not be dead. That always makes for an interesting case! Support from Rachel McAdams and Eddie Marsan are fine, but Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law are the real stars as Holmes and Watson. As odd as it seems, they really do have a buddy factor that works well on screen. Downey's physicality has always set him apart from many contemporary actors ... he moves like a dancer and fights like a champion. Jude Law is often too pretty-boy for me, but he really does a nice job of capturing the reluctant sidekick with complimentary skills.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Sherlock Who?,"I avoided this film in theaters. The trailers indicated I wouldn't see a Sherlock Holmes I'd know or like. And the DVD justified my fears. I didn't want to sit through ""Sherlock Holmes---Superhero!"" I wanted a plot that had at least some plausibility. It's hard to believe this was directed by an Englishman. It doesn't feel true to its period, or English society in general. I wanted a version of Victorian-Edwardian England I'd at least recognize. This concoction plays like Michael Bey mugging Arthur Conan Doyle. I will give Robert Downey Jr credit. He does bring some genuine panache to ole Sherlock. In fact, his performance makes it all bearable. The rest of a pretty good cast is wasted in a hyped-up video game version of Sherlock Holmes.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Amusing and thoroughly entertaining,"I've never read the original series of ""Sherlock Holmes"", so I did not know what to expect walking into the theater. To make things more complicating, I've read reviews that said it was far different than the novels.As an avid moviegoer, I was thoroughly impressed by this movie. There's no boring dialog or voice-over narration that trumps the opening, rather it puts the viewer right into the action, like a James Bond film, and then progresses to a big climax. There is a lot of action in this film, but there's also a lot of mystery in it, like a detective show.Robert Downey Jr., who I've come to appreciate as a decent actor, immerses himself into his character so well that he becomes Holmes. Not the one from the books as fans of the novels would say, but rather his own take on the character. He's sophisticated, smart, and charming, but also one hell of a brawler and a risk taker. Downey Jr. though doesn't make the show alone. Jude Law as his sidekick Watson is also wonderful. He's like Holmes in many aspects, but he's the more organized, and well-groomed hero who doesn't take as many risks. Downey Jr. and Law make a great pair, or as I like to call the new Batman and Robin. The other actors fitted their roles well, but I felt Mark Strong as Lord Blackwood was a weak villain; there was no depth to his character and his motives for why he wants to ""rule the world."" He does have an appearance of a good villain, but he doesn't really deliver as a great one.But what makes up in this loss is the witty plot, which keeps you guessing throughout the film, and at the end throws a sudden, unexpected twist, leaving a cliffhanger for a sequel. The viewer is behind Holmes who pieces everything together, like Patrick Jane in ""The Mentalist"".Adding to the plot is some of the most beautiful sets and costumes, I haven't seen in a long time. In watching the big screen, I felt like I was in London during the late 1800s. Adding to the authenticity of the sets and costumes is the sweat, dirt, and filth that was packed onto the streets and inside the buildings, which gives a taste of poverty that seems long since forgotten in London. The dim lighting, and deep shadows, (as well as excellent camera shots/compositions), gives the film a very dark and mysterious feel to it, like an eerie mystery should. I'll note that Hans Zimmer score however contradicts this tone with an uplifting tune that sounds very much like ""Pirates of the Caribbean.""Overall though, Sherlock Holmes is a witty, fun, dark, mysterious, action-packed, funny, and surprisingly good movie. For you fans of the novel series, put the books aside and enjoy this film!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Good fun.,"It's an entertaining movie.Really good fun. It's not really trying to do anything profound. Just exist as a piece of fun filmmaking and it is.You're just meant to marvel at how smart Sherlock is as he deals with his relationship with Watson drifting apart and his attraction to Irene Adler all while trying to hunt down a guy trying to take control of a shadowing organization. And it is entertaining to watch him outwit people. The dialogue is the best because he talks so fast and pretentious like no real person does or can and it's so funny.Just mindless fun, really unlike what I'm told the source material is. But it's still fun.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
I was knocked out in 2 hours,"Sherlock Holmes knocked me out in 2 hours. He knocked me out so hard, I am writing my first ever review. I tried to watch the movie on Saturday after Christmas, but all the shows were either full or had front section seats. I did not want to watch this movie feeling some pain in my neck. I went home, booked the ticket online for the next day and left the theatre with a feeling of solving a mystery myself. YES!! I totally fell for the movie and throughout the movie I was sitting like I was the mystery solver. I would say this is tied with 2 other movies, The Inglorious Basterds and Avatar as my 3 best movies of the year.I have seen RocknRolla and Snatch from Guy Ritchie and I like his stylish way of film making. I like the witty and dark humor and I would say I am pretty much impressed with Sherlock Holmes. Downey Jr. and Jude law were all over the movie. Critics may not give the best rating for this movie and either the IMDb rating does not reflect the caliber of this movie. This movie might not also fall into the Oscar section. But, but, but, for few of those out there, this movie stands out as one of the sexiest movies ever made for the background color it has, for the stylish look it has, and lot more. Most importantly, I never felt a single second boring, from the start of the movie. If you are not good with the English accent, you may feel some words are missing, but they are not too many. HIT THE ROAD, REACH THE THEATRE, WATCH THE MOVIE, and SHERLOCK HOLMES WILL KNOCK YOU OUT AND YOU WILL NEED A LOTTA TIME TO RECOVER.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Good not Great,"Pretty solid effort, but 15 minutes or so too long. It seems everyone is reluctant to edit movies anymore. This movie could have cut some unnecessary parts and made it a tighter movie and still had character development. Chemistry is definitely there between Downey Jr and Jude Law. I actually thought they could have played to this a bit more. Cast overall is solid, but Rachel McAdams is somewhat wasted in her role. Solid directing from Guy Ritchie, he plays it straight for the most part but brings his little direction touches. I like his look to London, it suits the film well. Thought the story could have been a bit better and I think the subject matter could have been a bit darker or creepier.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

Very entertaining mystery-action flick.,"Robert Downey Jr. And Jude Law vs. An evil black magician. The sets, while partly CGI, we're very good. You really believed in the old-timey vibe. The fight scenes were awesome and very much what you'd expect from Guy Ritchie. The black magic plot was interesting and the cult was based off the Masons or the Golden Dawn, so it was pretty realistic feeling. I was wondering if the magic was real until the end, where I found out for sure. All-around very entertaining.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

"Even worse than Wild, Wild West","I thought it would be hard for a remake to be worse than Wild, Wild West but this version of Sherlock Holmes managed to do it. And that was just on old TV series, while Sherlock Holmes founded a whole literary genre.It's not surprising that this anachronistic action thriller on steroids is popular -- the budget, the production values, the actors all saw to that. What's surprising is that those who claim to have read the stories by Arthur Conan Doyle still maintain that this Victorian James Bond has anything to do with him. This hodgepodge borrows everything, from Indiana Jones in the opening scene to James Bond apocalypses -- everything that is except the original works by Doyle.What Robert Downey does on the screen may be entertaining, but it has nothing to do with acting. Jude Law is his usual insipid self. Rachel McAdams is her usual glowing self, though totally miscast in what may be the worst-written role in a pathetic script.Hollywood has truly abandoned any pretense to making quality films in its pursuit of the adolescent audience it thinks will save it. Good luck with that.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Riveting, stylish and entertaining","Sherlock Holmes. The name synonymous with intelligence bearing a Victorian aura, reflecting upon criminal masterminds with sophistication, quick-wit and sharp deduction, is re-introduced to us by Guy Ritchie, the man behind 'Lock, Stock & two smoking barrels', 'Snatch' & 'Rock n Rolla'. He might not be the most obvious choice for such an undertaking but aided by an entertaining Robert Downey Jr., Ritchie pulls this one off the Lord's hat. For all the Jeremy Brett fans who did not see Conan Doyle's 'Holmes' in anyone but that sopshisticated, sharp, often loud and over-reacting personification with the aura of higher intelligence, Downey Jr. is here to re-define all those semblances while capturing Doyle's original character in rawness that is entertaining. In a spectacularly re-created London of the 1890's, an utterly insolent and messed-up Holmes is drinking medical potions to keep himself up, laying in his room for days without care and experimenting trials on a poor dog while being rudely blunt with Dr. Watson's girlfriend at an important dinner. This eccentric detective is a departure from the suave icon of yesteryears. But his true self is seen in his analytical thinking that helps him deduct the smallest, often unthinkable details around him. The calculating bare-knuckle boxer is a testament of the new Holmes, courtesy Guy Ritchie with the slow-mo capturing his distinctive style. Watson is displeased with Holmes' behavior but he cannot keep himself from being the able aid of the renowned detective. This passive, dismissive but ass kicking relationship is one of the highlights of the movie. The chemistry between the actors is great to watch and it sets the tone for this being an entertaining franchise. The duo intervene an act of sacrifice performed by the satanic Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) resulting in his capture which only begins a twisted plot that as threatened, will change the very fabric of time. After his execution, the Lord emerges from the dead, bringing dread to the world and a renewed energy into Holmes who was restless so far for a new case. What follows is an action packed adventure that brings the investigation to the Parliament where the sinister device of Lord Blackwood is set to wipe out the existing government. With some additional help from Irene (Rachel Adams), Holmes while refraining from an obvious distraction, uncovers the Lord's plot in a climax atop the under-construction draw bridge. In a conniving manner, Ritchie leaves the story open ended with the foul smell of the greatest nemesis of our detective lurking in the case that will soon be re-opened. Eddie Marson as Officer Lestrade is perfect for his part while Mark Strong as Blackwood makes a sinister villain. Although, one would've hoped to see more of him. Jude Law adds composure to the entertaining pair while his chemistry with Downey Jr. is a treat to watch. Robert Downey Jr. may be the only actor to play two convincing action heroes with equal finesse and excellence. We can't get enough of his misbehavior and reckless acts till he gets everything right and emerges as the hero in his movies. Downey adds a refreshing twist to Holmes' character that is a departure from conventional versions but is distinct and Victorian just the same. Guy Ritchie captures London in dazzling fashion with construction omnipresent in the city's boom time. While he churns out enough explosions and raw action, his focus remains on a fine script that gives ample opportunity for Holmes to not miss any opportunity that can close his case. The one striking aspect of the film that makes it a winner is that throughout its 2hr30min duration, it incessantly entertains with every unfolding scene. Audacious as he was while experimenting with Holmes' character, he has succeeded in establishing all characters of this franchise while leaving scope for witty humor and deeper bonding between them in the future. Sherlock Holmes is re-invented for the new generation with the same essence of the legendary character authored by Arthur Conan Doyle and Robert Downey Jr. packs enough punch with Ritchie's entertainment to make it elementary for you to not miss this opportunity.8.55 on a scale of 1-10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
It still is a Sherlock Holmes movie,"Some people will like it others will not. While three girls in front of me just couldn't stop commenting the movie, between 5 and 10 people left the theater before the end...We all have some vision of Sherlock Holmes. Honestly, if I were making the Sherlock Holmes movie Robert Downey Jr. would not be my first pick. But after seeing the movie I kind of like it. Despite the numerous comments – this is not really a completely different Sherlock. OK, as one can see from the trailers - he is a bit-of-action-hero-like one, but not completely unexpected. Not for Sherlock fans, at least.The movie plays on a narrow bridge between provocation and disappointment, probably just in order to tell the old story in an original way.

To rob him of that award was unforgivable.

We were thinking its going to be film for kids only, but you know it looked to have good effects in it.I guess we were wrong, I mean it is not a masterpiece of cinema. But is that what most people are looking for? Sometimes I am, sometimes I'm not, and when you are hungover from a party with your work mates this is exactly what you can watch... especially with your girlfriend. I mean she likes perhaps films that are more chick flicks and periodical drama, whereas I do like periodical dramas then again I like action, and horror too.Worked for both of us.

Really good,"What a cracker of a film! I went not expecting too much, but thoroughly enjoyed a cracking story - great humanity in Robert Downey's performance and of course Jude Law doing his bit. The scenery was authentic (though all cgi of course), and the movies overall feel was League of Extraordinary Gentlemen meets Bourne Supremacy. Guy Ritchie has a great feel for an English-type story (poss from all his Gangster type pics), this is a strong thread in this film - the smells and sights of Victorian England are strongly drawn.I particularly liked the story twists and writing.

Holmes Update Could Have Been Told Better,"Rachel Adams, Jude Law, & Robert Downey Jr. are the strengths of this film. The weakness is the complicated structure given to the film by Director Guy Richie. In this case the film might have been more effective telling the story more straight forward. While Richies film looks highly stylized, he gambles on losing members of his audience with the way he sequences it.Richies idea is at times to drill into Sherlock Holmes head and reflect what Holmes plans are before he executes them, then have him execute them. He then has times where he has Holmes do something, then show how he did it afterwords. I was able to follow this.The depiction of Holmes character is indeed an accurate one, and I give Richie credit for staying away from the Basil Rathbone styled Holmes. The performances of the cast and the atmosphere created for the film look very good on the screen which helps the film immensely.Rachel Adams acts & looks great in this & it seems there are some decent sparks between her and Downey's Holmes. Think with more directing experience Richie might find he doesn't have to work as hard on style but do more with substance.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Sherlock Holmes? In name only.,"Whoever is responsible for this film should write Arthur Conan Doyle a fervent letter of apology for using his legendary detectives name in vain. Had this film been called the ""Marvelous Adventures of Chuckie and his sidekick Frank"" it may have passed as something of value; as it is, it is a revisionist trashing of the Holmes brand. Nothing about the character portrayed by Robert Downey even comes close to suggesting the persona of Holmes, except maybe the pipe and that was thrown in, it appears, as an afterthought. The plot is silly, the lines ridiculous and the acting is minimal. When the arch villain asks the Houses of Parliament why they are surprised to see him, when all think him dead, it puts an exclamation point on one of the saddest and silliest movies I have seen in a long time. Sorry, Arthur, better luck, hopefully next time.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
One of the best summer blockbusters I've seen in awhile,"Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.), with his sidekick Dr. John Watson (Jude Law), accepts the task of unraveling the mystery surrounding Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) and his plot that threatens England and the rest of the world whilst dealing with Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams). A seemingly standard mystery is turned into an exciting, fast-paced movie thanks to many people. Guy Ritchie infuses the film with his gritty style and fast action which keeps the story running at a steady pace with no lull. The cast is excellent, Downey Jr. and Law are perfectly cast as the mystery-solving duo, with the perfect amount of side-by-side fighting and bickering to make it believable. Hans Zimmer's score suits the tone and style of the film very well, and late 1800s London is recreated realistically. The only weakness I found was the screenplay, which was not bad, but personally I found the story got quite convoluted towards the middle. Of course, Holmes' explanation at the end reveals everything very nicely. Sherlock Holmes is a great summer movie, a perfect balance of mystery, drama, and action with a charismatic cast and a brisk pace which should entertain everyone that is willing to go along for the ride.4/5",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Great film and worthy of a second look,"I am hoping that the makers of this film make a sequel. It was so well done and entertaining. There were many twists and turns, and I think the only actor around today that could POSSIBLY have been better as Sherlock Holmes is Johnny Depp. Robert Downey, Jr was SPOT ON as Holmes and I absolutely loved what they did with the character of Dr Watson. Jude Law is incredible. We are planning to see it again soon, now that we know the outcome, to see what small clues we missed during the first viewing.I think Rachel McAdams held her own against a formidable cast as Irene (the scene in the hotel room was particularly funny), and Mark Strong was chilling as Lord Blackwood.There is a lot of humor throughout, and I loved the foreshadowing of Holmes' actions in some of the film. The actual style of the film was very well done, from the way the city was laid out, to the casting, costuming, make up, etc. All in all, it is an awesome film and very well worth the ticket price.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Great Movie, Though It Isn't the Sherlock I Imagined","From the trailer alone, I knew that Guy Ritchie's take on Arthur Conan Doyle's classic character Sherlock Holmes was a departure from what I had imagined this ace detective to be as I read his books. Of course, the keen eye for detail and the amazing powers of deduction Holmes is well-known for is there. But seeing Holmes shirtless, bare-knuckle boxing for money, and looking like Robert Downey Jr., was certainly not the image of Sherlock I had in mind.The lead cast is instrumental in bringing this film to vivid life. Robert Downey Jr. recreates the role of Sherlock Holmes and made it his own. His delivery of those witty one-liners are too funny. Jude Law is very good in his portrayal of the fastidious Dr. Watson. He also isn't exactly what I imagined Watson to be, but is close enough. Their chemistry together is impeccable, very effective in driving this film forward.However, I did not really like the main supporting cast. Rachel Mc Adams, I do not really like this actress since ""The Notebook"", and I think she wasted the Irene Adler character. Mark Strong as the main villain Lord Blackwood, had a strong and sinister face on close-ups, but his overall appearance and bearing in full body shots were not imposing enough to conjure fear in the audience.Nonetheless, this was a very good movie. The script was interesting, humorous and intelligent. The action sequences were exciting and well-executed. They made good use of computer imagery to recreate Victorian London and the diabolical mysteries afoot. Overall, this was a very good mainstream effort by Guy Ritchie. He had succeeded to transform the cerebral Sherlock of old into a brawny blockbuster hero fit for these hyperactive times.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Sherlock Holmes - A great new adventure,There have been many versions of sherlock holmes before but this is definitely the best so far. Robert Downey Jr (RDJ) portrays Sherlock Holmes brilliantly and is greatly supported by Jude Law as Dr. Watson. This combination has brought life into this classic. The movie is fast paced and has some good twists. Though the overall character development is not perfect the chemistry between Jude and RDJ was awesome.The narration is half baked and very repetitive in certain portions. The other characters also do justice to their roles and have shown great scene presence. Guy Ritchie has done a great job in the direction department has again shown that his movies have a dark comedy element to it like some of his previous flicks like Lock Stock or even Snatch.There are a few plot holes in the script but again they are because of the poor narration and some screenplay flaws. The background score was pretty commendable. Also certain dialogues cant be understood clearly at all due to mumbling by RDJ(really irritating at times).The art direction needs a special mention for some great sets and the overall look. The movie is a definite entertainer and a will be a great watch. The movie's ending shows hopes for a great sequel and looking forward to thatVerdict : 7/10,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Nothing spectacular,"I enjoyed watching this movie, it was quite entertaining. However I never had a moment where I didn't know what was going to happen next.

One Of The Most Entertaining Movies Of The Holiday Season,"Robert Downey Jr. has, in recent years, made a reputation for himself and the movies he headlines. You can expect a few things from them. Firstly, they're probably going to be fun. This is evidenced by Tropic Thunder, and even more so, Iron Man. Secondly, there is a good amount of humor put into his roles. In this new version of the famous Baker Street detective, he continues his trend of blockbuster making roles as he serves up a joyous and often times funny portrayal of Sherlock Holmes.This time around, Holmes and Watson, played to a T by Jude Law, must tackle a seemingly supernatural case involving a resurrected Lord Blackwood back from the dead. The rest of the film is spent chasing the once deceased Lord and figuring out his next move. And it is quite a wild ride through London at that. The film succeeds in spades thanks largely to its perfectly cast leading men and a smart script that provides a fantastic maze of a story that has one guessing right up to the end, just as traditional Sherlock Holmes tales have done. Law and Downey Jr. work so perfectly together, it could be argued that this is the best couple of any movie in recent history. And what perfect casting. Jude Law, commonly known for more sophisticated, yet hard bitten, roles oozes such here with a Watson who is quite sophisticated and smart, but also displays a natural talent for fighting his way out of a physical confrontation. Likewise, Downey brings his usual mixture of crazy and cocky to it's most raw. It also helps that both characters are flawed in very realistic ways (Watson a compulsive gambler, Holmes an obsessive compulsive drinker), the way that the characters are often best done.Another very positive element is the mixture of elements between the story, character development, and action, all of which work superbly. The action is much more down to earth and far less CGI-ey that was once believed. The story, while many have said is uninteresting, still commands attention as it sets up a fine and inventive mystery. Above all, the character development creates two very fun and fascinating characters that are two of the most enjoyable of any film in recent memory.Sherlock Holmes isn't a perfect film. Far from it, Rachel McAdams is wasted here as a love interest and Mark Strong falls short of a worthy adversary for Downey Jr., whose Holmes is far more impressive than the lackluster Lord Blackwood. And some of the story seems a bit forced, as if elements were put it in simply to push the story through. However, these are not nearly enough to deter from what works in the film, and what works, works so well. Sherlock Holmes is definitely a great way to end 2009 in film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

Did little for me,"For those who don't know, the TV show Dr. House, MD (or just ""House"") is based on Sherlock Holmes and his friend Watson, with the characters renamed to House and Wilson.So, having been a fan of House, the TV show, for a long time, I'm growing bored with it. It's neat that the main character can solve medical mysteries and find cleverly hidden clues in people's lives. But I've grown so tired of watching that miserable person manipulate coworkers and meddle with people's lives. Then I watch the movie Sherlock Holmes. And it's the same stuff with which I'm already bored.So this movie had that going against it.Then the mystery was impossible. I mean, there's no need for the audience to even try to figure out anything in the movie, because it's all far too complicated for you to solve. Kinda defeats the purpose of a mystery movie.And then the story was haphazard. Each scene seemed to pop-up out of nowhere. There was no logical tie-in from one scene to the next. I'd bet you could take all the scenes, shuffle them in a Yatzee cup, and dump them out, letting them land where they may, and the movie would make about as much sense as it does now.Any good story - particularly where a mystery is being ""solved"" - the audience should be right there with the main character, thinking ahead, knowing where we must search next. We should just barely predict the next location. But instead, it's all so random seeming.Other than that, I admit, RDJ's body was impressive. My lady friend enjoyed that part of the movie. But even for free, I'd never sit through this movie again.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Sherlock takes Action...,"Never having been an actual fan of Sherlock Holmes, I sat down in the theatre quite apprehensive towards the casting of Robert Downey Jr in playing the renowned English detective, but the moment the picture started rolling and the sight of a perfectly realistic late 1800s London appeared before my eyes, I realized I'd chosen the right picture. Apart from Robert Downey Jr's excellent British accent and the amazing chemistry between all the actors, the plot, set, and twists of the story left very little to be desired... I had before this seen television versions of the famous story of the detective, for instance THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES. This series had left me with a terribly boring image of the detective, which got completely blasted away by this amazing and entertaining picture. The constant irony and bickering between Holmes and Watson, made the movie even more fun to watch, and an unpredictable Rachel McAdams in the part of Irene Adler gave the whole movie an extra twist and the hope for a sequel... I have been told that the image of Sherlock Holmes in this movie has been altered from the one projected in his books, however I believe that if you , like me, are ignorant of Holmes' original personality, then you will come to enjoy this movie very much. If you, like me, enjoy movies that make you take a step into the past and live adventures of which you have heard only legends and myths, then you should definitely see Sherlock Holmes.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

I do get completely offended when it's a film with a marketing budget larger than the GDP of Sri Lanka and they let it go.

Not Exactly Elementary,"In Director Guy Ritchie's vision renowned detective Sherlock Holmes is a martial artist and extreme intellect. Surprisingly, Ritchie's ""Sherlock Holmes"" is more action movie than moody whodunit piece. In some ways this is strangely entertaining seeing Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson as an action buddy movie. Both Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law are up to the task as Holmes and Watson. Downey is amazing as Sherlock Holmes embodying an aloofness, keen intellect, and physicality in the role. Law is charismatic, comical, and dashing as Watson. Their friendship is almost marriage like with the intermittent bickering and underlying love for each other. Which glaringly points to forced romance involving Holmes's former love thief Irene Adler played by Rachel McAdams. I am a fan of McAdams; however, her character seems more plot device and narrative foreshadowing of Holmes's greatest nemesis.The story and screenplay by Michael Robert Johnson, Anthony Peckham, Simon Kinberg, and Lionel Wigram surrounds the evil Lord Blackwood (malevolent Mark Strong), who apparently returns from the dead to end the world as we know it. So it is up to Holmes and Watson to foil the evil and powerful Blackwood. Having these many writers involved is usually not a coherently good sign. At times it is not.In the opening sequence Holmes dispatches Blackwood's henchman with martial arts precision. Apparently, Holmes's vast knowledge of human anatomy and his brawling avocation make him a dangerous marital artist. According to Ritchie this resembles the Doyle character. Watson is also a formidable fighter, despite his war injury. Watson wields his cane as a deadly weapon itself. Downey got shredded for the movie, and Law looks lean and strong.In ""Sherlock Holmes"" Holmes and Watson apprehend Lord Blackwood before he murders another young girl in a ceremonial Black Arts sacrifice. Blackwood is sentenced to be hanged. His last request is a visit from Holmes. He warns Holmes, ""You must widen your gaze"" Apparently, not everything is as it seems. Lord Blackwood seemingly returns from the dead to exact his revenge. The perplexed Holmes seeks to uncover the truth.That supernatural storyline is engaging. What is really entertaining is the ""Odd Couple"" storyline of roommates Holmes and Watson. Turns out, Watson is engaged to capable and beautiful Mary Morstan (strong Kelly Reilly); thus, threatening Holmes's relationship to Watson. Downey is at his arrogantly funny best as he exposes Mary at dinner with Watson. At about the same time Irene (McAdams) shows up enrolling the aid of Holmes to find a man. Irene may be blackmailed into doing so—all very mysterious.There are a lot of loose threads throughout ""Sherlock Holmes"" aside from the Blackwood storyline. Even that one is ""elementary"" in the words of the famous detective. Downey and Law however, engage and compel throughout. Often at odds, we know that their life and death bond is one of respect and love. That shameless bravado and the charisma of Downey and Law make ""Sherlock Holmes"" worth watching. And we can look forward to Sherlock Holmes's greatest nemesis in the sequel, perhaps.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
The latest incarnation of Holmes is exciting and interesting.,"Guy Ritchie's latest is a little disappointing from time to time yet is still an overall success. When focussing on the problem-solving it is nothing less than enthralling. Holmes and Watson cleverly deduce their way through the clues with sharp dialogue and crackling banter, and on occasion, a fist fight that packs a wallop. Ritchie proves himself a worthy director when it comes to a more conventional film, his normal flashiness put aside for greater attention to detail and longer-lasting shots. However, where it tends to go wrong is in the large-scale sequences. The CGI-driven set pieces are generally seamless, but they just feel out of place. A duel atop London's Tower Bridge – mid-construction – is a major example of the unnecessary enormity given to the action scenes.Robert Downey Jr is clearly at the top of his game. The last few years has seen him become one of the finest actors in the industry, with roles in quality pictures like A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints, A Scanner Darkly, Zodiac, Iron Man, Tropic Thunder and now Sherlock Holmes. Here he gives a modernised Holmes the perfect balance of intellect and wit, to keep the long-standing fans happy, and arrogance and brashness, to rope in a new horde of followers. Downey's take on one of Britain's most enduring detectives holds the entire movie in good stead, had he misfired it could have been an awkward affair.It's not just Downey who is on show though. Jude Law does the beloved Dr Watson much justice; he provides a terrifically stable counterpart to the wise-cracking and insolent Holmes. Despite playing the straight character of the two, Law manages to wring out a fair few laughs with his perpetual annoyance towards Holmes' antics and he clearly has a natural chemistry with Downey. Elsewhere Rachel McAdams is a sufficiently seductive Irene Adler, it isn't hard to understand why Holmes is so infatuated with her, but her role could've have been a touch juicier. Unacceptably, Mark Strong is one-dimensional and even, at times, very bland as Lord Blackwood. He makes for a dull villain and you get the impression he was just a gap-filler until they unleash Holmes' more famous arch-nemesis, one of the Professor kind.A couple of gripes aside, the latest incarnation of Holmes is exciting and interesting. With plenty of room to improve and a superb pairing of Downey and Law, the probable sequel should be a corker.3.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Great stuff,"We loved this film. It hit the mark on so many levels; the sets/locations were authentic, the acting was superb,it was absolutely gripping from the very beginning,loved the quirky music score too. I can't believe some people have said it was boring. The pace of the film was almost dizzying! Great fun and a visual feast. I'm no film critic, as you can probably tell but don't be put off going to see this film by the negative reviews bleating on about; Sherlock is too scruffy; its nothing like the books; Watson isn't old enough,etc etc. Who cares!!! They are just silly details that detract from the fact that this is a really entertaining film. Well done Guy Richie, i like your style.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
proof that we'll follow Robert Downey Jr anywhere,"Guy Ritchie doesn't make movies, he makes delivery systems for stupidity. Loud, empty, aggressively uninteresting, a Guy Ritchie movie is almost as ugly as Christmas in a dorm room and just as depressing. At least in your dorm, you could make phone calls home and maybe read a book. In a Guy Ritchie movie, all you can do is sleep. And you can't even do that unless you bring earplugs.Ritchie diligently repeats every piece of information - vital, moderately important, irrelevant - as if convinced the audience shares his I.Q. deficit. Redundancy is a fond memory in his world: dead horses at least make a different noise when beaten in different locations. Shake a stick at Guy Ritchie and you get the same reaction every time, a hollow thud resonating in a void. A very loud hollow thud.Downey is fine, but he's been better in better comic books. Jude Law is very good, but other than SLEUTH, when was he not? And the great wasteland of this SHERLOCK, and of any Guy Ritchie product, is populated by excellent supporting players brought to mediocrity. Ritchie has succeeded in failing to make Mark Strong an exciting screen presence, a feat even Ridley Scott couldn't accomplish; the lovely Rachel McAdams, who has proved her ability in drama and comedy, here can't even manifest the basic facial expressions of the pantomime: fear? Nope. Passion? Uh-uh. Boredom? Well, we're together on that one.Yes, I've read every one of the Conan Doyle stories, and yes, there's ample support for Holmes as a pugilist, a narcissist, an adrenaline junkie. What I have failed to find any previous evidence of is Holmes as a soporific. Guy Ritchie has performed a sort of Christmas miracle by making one of the great dynamic intellectuals of literature into a dull, third rate professor of history.If you're going to make a movie with more than five set pieces, you'd do well to realize you're making an action movie. And if you're making an action movie, it behooves you to ensure that the audience hasn't seen every one of the fights before, not only in countless other movies but in THIS one! What a breakthrough, Guy. Watching one of your movies is like regurgitating a piece of gristle. Madonna, mediocrity that she is, was as close as you ever got to significance.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Robert Downey Jr. plays this role as good as he did Iron Man, Sherlock is rather astounding.","I really wanted to see this one in theaters, but I unfortunately never got around to it. Instead I got the DVD as an Easter gift and have to say it was a really entertaining flick that I thoroughly enjoyed. Of course when you get right down to it I suppose I liked this one mainly thanks to Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of the famous detective from England. He is quickly becoming my favorite actor which is kind of funny and sad that really no one in the younger generation can really carry a movie like this man who was once in very really danger of ending up like so many young actors who achieve success at a young age. Instead, he has rebuilt himself as a person who can take on action roles and is able to deliver humorous quips while in said movie. Let's face it who else in the younger generation is even close, certainly not say Shia LeBleaf a guy they say is the next big thing, but all he has done is star opposite Harrison Ford and giant robots both of which were the primary draw for people seeing those movies. Here Sherlock is shown at the beginning of the film foiling the plans of a man named Blackdale. He is apparently some sort of black magic practitioner. Well it is not to long after that this man is hung, but after a bit it seems that this man has risen from the grave and once again Sherlock must find out what is going on. This Sherlock seems equipped with an extremely sharp mind capable of processing information at an astounding rate. At times it seems he processes to much info which is probably why he is in need of a smoke from his pipe which contains something other than tobacco I believe. The setting is nice, I like the way the movie looked and the cast apart from Robert is good too as Jude Law made an excellent Dr. Watson. I enjoyed their byplay. Good action, good mystery and good humor in this movie had it all pretty much covered. There does seem to be a huge opening for a sequel, I usually prefer a movie to be standalone unless you already have the other movies pretty much made as was the case with the Lord of the Ring trilogy, but I will forgive it here as this movie was successful enough I believe to have a sequel green lighted. I do wish though that he had one more of his narrations where he says to himself how he is going to take someone out and then they show it. All in all though a rather complete film that was entertaining, hopefully Iron Man 2 will be as fun to watch as this one was.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Robert Downey JR was fantastic in this movie! The Rest was mediocre.,"I honestly don't know what to say. The story was decent, Jude Law was alright, Rachel Mcadams was alright.

Fun and smart,"I knew right away that I wanted to watch this. Ritchie has a unique style, and while I would not have considered the idea of him using that approach to this franchise, I am immensely happy that someone did. This is very different from what we're used to, which has little to do with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's books(read the FAQ), and it hits the nail on the head for the core of his stories. Adding a gritty tone, his playing around with the speed of shots(and using it to greater effect than ever before in his films, I might add), and some exciting action/adventure, Guy has reinvented Sherlock, and without losing the essentials. The plot is brilliant, with plenty of twists. It will keep you guessing, and the ending is tremendously satisfying. The script is in general impeccable, with *hilarious* British verbal comedy(and the accents sound right, as well), and well-written, thoroughly developed and credible characters and relationships. Every acting performance is spot-on. Downey Jr. was the perfect choice, as was Law. McAdams is sensual, and gives a marvelous performance. I am thrilled to see Mark Strong, who impressed me beyond words in Body of Lies, getting a lead role in such a big movie, and I hope his career will continue to soar. The pace is amazing, and in spite of being fast, it doesn't overwhelm and you can follow it all, including the complex deductions. Editing and cinematography are simply excellent. The whole thing is beautifully shot, Victorian London looks *gorgeous*. This has a rather high production value, with sets, costumes, etc. all being stunningly done. The score is a tad unusual, and works well. There is continuous violence(I'd call it brutal, but I guess it was trimmed just enough to not be?), a little suggestive material and several bits of disturbing content. I recommend this to everyone who enjoys mysteries and/or Holmes, and who can live with the lack of the deerstalker and Callabash pipe. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Good Movie But Renters Beware,"Enjoyed the movie. I really like anything with Robert Downey Jr. and Judd Law played the perfect Watson. Mind you it's not the Sherlock you grew up with, but entertaining none the less ONCE YOU GET TO THE MOVIE! I don't like this disturbing trend where the studios are forcing you to watch the previews. You could not skip them at all. Stop or Menu did not work. Also this is the first DVD I have seen where the Menu did not have a Scene Selection option so if you stopped the movie and had to start it back, you had to start at the beginning and of course, watch the previews again. Fast Forward was the only thing that worked and it had to be done a couple of times to get through the 8 previews !!!We pay good money to rent the movies, we deserve better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Reimagined, good that seems great","Sherlock Holmes gives the viewer more than most films this holiday season. We enjoy many actors at their best, certainly to be topped by Downing Jr.and Law, who both give Depp-like popcorn performances. Guy Richie has intelligent style in his direction. And Zimmer's score plays as a strong supporter of the plot.To re-imagine Sherlock Holmes is not to just bring to life Doyle's Victorian detective.....but to confront the veteran movie goer with Christopher Plummer's detective, as well as Basil Rathbone's definitive interpretation. However, history does have an advantage here. There is no superb Sherlock Holmes' movie (perhaps Rathbone's Hounds of Baskervilles is close). And there still isn't. But there is another great interpretation to enjoy. And in this viewing, one will find these points of cinematic fascination.1. Do all Hollywood blockbuster's today require heroes who fight? Maybe, but when Richie directs the scenes this well, we understand Downey's Holmes much better.2. Why is Hollywood so male centered? Perhaps a movie based on two famous male detectives would not be the movie to ask this about, but Rachel McAdam's character brings this to point. She's very good, but for being such an important chacter, she gets very limited screen time.3. Is this film great? Well, the narrative is a little jumpy. But considering how bad popcorn movies have bee this year(other than Star Trek) perhaps we all should just enjoy a very good movie.Btw, be sure to savor the use of the violin for Holmes.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
very modern,"It is a Guy Ritchie movie through and through. Frankly he might diversify his directing techniques a bit. Having said that, I like his style and I liked the film. The acting is top notch, the music interesting (nothing ""English"" about it...), two gorgeous women, fast tempo... What I disliked was too much editing of the fighting scenes, at times impossible to see who was doing what, but I guess it is a malaise of most young directors these days. The CGI-created London was a bit too dark and monotonous, and a bit artificial at times. Holmes's clothes were too ""bohemian"" and out of touch I think, I know he was a rogue character, very eccentric and so, but still very British, no?? The way he dressed was more apt for... Tom Sawyer, too American. The bit about ""re-conquering the colony across the Atlantic"" was tad corny, Ritchie playing to the US audience too much here. What surprised me, and I have not seen any comments on it, is how Ritchie ridiculed the greatest myth of Christianity: that of Jesus' resurrection. The same was done in the French phenomenal costume drama ""The Brotherhood of the Wolves"" a few years back, and also nobody seemed to notice it then, or maybe nobody cared. Well, I do not care either.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Fails to pace the plot evenly,"Eye pleasure - great aesthetics that reminds people of late 1890s when everything was under construction, great costumes that well represent English gentlemen, actions that incorporate some smart move and science. Those are good requirements for a good motion picture.However, a detective story needs more than that. Tightly patched, strong and compelling plot. Audience follows the leads the characters find. The process itself to solution is as important as the conclusion. It is like walking up the stairs, one step at a time. If there are many leaps, one has to jump to the next stair; if stairs are irregular, one gets confused, and it's hard to adapt. The movie's narrative, especially the detective and mystery one, is the same. It has to be the work of fine stitching, no holes or gaps. 'Sherlock Holmes' fairly provides enough information and reasons behind Holmes' resolution, and it makes sense. However, all the mysteries are revealed at the ending all at once, so audience is led astray and feels the pause of concentration in the middle but feels hurried at the end.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
This film is not suitable for animal lovers.,"Yet again Guy Ritchie uses the carcasses of dead animals for effect, this time in a slaughter house. He treats these once living creatures as furniture.From the opening credits I could see that most of the horses in this film (there were many many scenes with horses) were frightened and I will be making a complaint to the RSPCA.The film was full of sensational nonsense, where I was left wondering why particular scenes were written into the script in the first place, in particular the ship yard fandango. Yawn.Robert Downey Jnr and Jude Law are both superb actors, but Rachel McAdams (was that her name?) looked like she had wondered out of the Time Traveller's Wife into another film and forgot to act differently.A film worth missing in general.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
unexpectedly excellent,"Hi just watched this film (waited for it to come out on DVD). I was very pleasantly enthralled. I enjoyed the Sherlock reinterpretation, and Watson's character.

I look forward to seeing the follow up - in cinema though this time!OK - got to stretch this out to 10 lines otherwise this site doesn't publish. What can I say....Robert Downey Jr is looking hot. He has certainly kept fit - and no botox either. That's so refreshing to see.

"Actually very close to the books, and thrilling","I don't have much time, so I'm going to keep it short and sweet. Robert Downey Jr is incredible as Sherlock Holmes, and his accent perfect. Many say that he mumbles throughout this film, but personally I had no trouble understanding him. Jude Law was good as Watson, although not a patch on Downey. We've all heard about the ""bromance"" between the two of them, and it really does come across in the film that these are two guys who get along excellently. There is more chemistry between Law and Downey than there is between their characters relationships, such as Watson and his fiancé Mary as well as Holmes and Irene Adler (played by Rachel McAdams), The film itself is very funny, exciting and never drags. Many people have been saying that it is not a very faithful adaption to the original Arthur Conan Doyle book series. There are no deerstalkers, magnifying glasses, trench coats or utterings of ""Elementary, my dear Watson"". However, if you actually read the books you will notice that Sherlock was characterised by none of these, and that the previous movies which used this stereotype make Guy Ritchie's version the most faithful adaption yet.It may be more for the Brits than their North American counterparts, appealing to the general British sense of humour lovers.

Sherlock Holmes adapts the eccentric detective through narrative mysticism and visual flair.,"Victorian London, 221B Baker Street. Home to the medically inclined Dr. John Watson and the reclusive yet ingenious private detective Sherlock Holmes. Embarking on many mysterious crimes that the city police have the intellectual incapacity to investigate. Missing person? Done. Unresolved murder? Easy. Stolen jewellery? Say no more. 1890, a ritualistic murder performed by the seemingly mystical Lord Blackwood is interrupted by Holmes and Watson, after asserting dislocations to several patellas and jaws. Blackwood, now sentenced to death for the grisly slaughtering of five women, forewarns Holmes of additional murders to come. ""Steal your mind Holmes, I need you"", he gently whispers. Graciously ignored, Blackwood is hanged, only to defy the laws of nature and resurrect himself a day later. Inexplicable actions aside, London is shrouded in terror, and it's up to Holmes and Watson to solve this mystery enveloped in both science and magic.Ritchie's adaptation of Conan Doyle's legendary literary figure, is undoubtedly his best non-British gangster film. There, it's been said! The director himself has a peculiar style. Very frenetic, often hyperactive. An aesthetic quality that seamlessly harmonises with the eponymous fictitious character and his personality. The eccentricities, from the elongated narrational splurges of explanations streaming from Holmes' consciousness to the erratic behaviour perpetuating the unsociable skills he has acquired, are brilliantly captured in a story that is essentially moulded by them. Each uniquely discovered clue, whether that be an object or a location, usually leads the pair into a brawl with some ""propa"" feisty henchmen, including a colossal French behemoth aptly named Dredger. Ritchie effortlessly merges the mystery elements of a classic Conan Doyle novel with the general entertainment of a blockbuster, even if this diverts from the source material, without diminishing the overall investigation.There's a narrative buoyancy that maintains a level of humour and amusement throughout, mostly due to the hugely accessible screenplay. When it's not inserting substantial amounts of foreshadowing (trust me, there's a lot...), the script primarily focusses on the amicable friendship between Holmes and Watson, exploring the differing qualities they inhibit and emphasising their contrasts. Considering Watson desires to become happily married and remove Holmes' eccentricities from his life, he can't let go of the adrenaline. The two, often bickering like a married couple, supply the energy Ritchie's feature requires. Holmes' exaggerated bohemianism granting him several memorable scenes and asserting the character's peculiarities almost immediately, such as utilising musical theory to create order from chaos with a group of harmless flies trapped in a glass cylinder (don't ask...).Again, the film works solely based on these two, with fantastic central performances to accompany the characters. Downey Jr., exercising his long forgotten 'Chaplin' accent, fully embraces Holmes physically and emotionally. The erratic body movements and rapid line delivery were executed exceptionally well, to the point where he became the character. His chemistry with Law, whom excellently portrayed Watson as a typical Victorian-era doctor, was infectious. McAdams, playing the femme fatale love interest, unfortunately was weak in comparison. Assuming the role of an underdeveloped Irene Adler, of which rarely presented any romantic chemistry with Downey Jr., likened the character to a plot convenience than anything else. Strong, typecast as the villain once again, exudes a menacing presence despite the weak showdown atop Tower Bridge that relinquished that terror almost indefinitely.Supplementing the ornate art direction, is Zimmer's score. Iconic. Utilising authentic instruments including a ""broken pub piano"", banjo and cimbalom, he crafted yet another outstanding composition that brought life to Victorian London. A contender for his best score yet? Quite possibly.It retains Ritchie's blend of modern entertainment with ancient stories, that's what makes Sherlock Holmes enjoyable. Clues percolating into action. Revelations dissolving into ultimatums. He crafted an authentic adaptation that would appeal to the masses, whilst pleasing hardcore fans of the novels. With credible performances to balance out the uneven moments of brutal foreshadowing, Sherlock Holmes solves the case brilliantly and opens himself up to a new potential mystery with his arch-nemesis...",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"No shirt, Sherlock","This is an entertaining film, but it adds nothing to the canon of filmed versions of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's detective. As some have mentioned casting Robert Downey Jr. was certainly interesting, but Downey seems insecure with the role (and the accent). He's enjoying his performance much more than the audience.Jude Law is—as ever—reliable in what he's given to do. His exasperation with Holmes' peculiarities seemed a little intense for what would have been a lifelong acquaintance. But it doesn't help to compare the Sherlock Holmes enterprise with this particular film.If I were casting this movie, I'd have put Mark Strong as Holmes (he has the stature, composure and profile) and Downey in the role of Lord Blackwood. But here again there's no point in wishing this film and its concept were somehow different. We have to look at what's on the screen.It's basically a ""Classics Illustrated"" version of Doyle's detective. Pow! Bam! Boom! being operativea lot. The washed out gray palette is appropriate (and right out of Tim Burton's ""Sweeney Todd""). Dirt is everywhere, even under Holmes' fingernails. The ""mystery"" here is of the Indiana Jones variety, and, in fact, the whole tone of the movie has that kind of daring do. The opening sequence is right out of Martin Campbell's ""Casino Royale."" And while this film isn't badly directed, it's just nothing new.It would be nice to see Guy Ritchie get serious. He has talent, but he doesn't trust it. He wants to shock us, and, I guess he doesn't go to many films. Because today, the audience really can't be shocked. Downey rips off his shirt and has an extended ""boxing"" brawl to hone his. Well we're not sure. But it gives Ritchie the opportunity to do something that has nothing to do with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. And that isn't shocking; it's just silly.""The Seven-Per-Cent Solution,"" ""Sherlock, Jr."" were interesting shifts in points of view of this famous character. Ritchie's point of view is truculent, and it winds up looking, if not childish, sadly adolescent.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Victorian Buddy Comedy,"In recent times films set in the Victorian Era have become more popular, examples being Sweeney Todd: the Demon Barber of Fleet Street and The Prestige. Sherlock Holmes has been big property over the years, from novels and short stories, to film and TV programmes. Even when Sherlock Holmes was in it's cinematic hiatus, there was still TV movies and programmes, and Holmes has always been in the public consciousness. Warner Brothers has had great success with franchises like Harry Potter and Batman, and obviously want to continue with more established material. It has also become more popular to reboot franchise because of the success of Batman and James Bond.In Victorian London Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr) and Dr. John Watson (Jude Law) prevent the murder of a young woman by Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong), a Occultist responsible for four other murders. He is sentenced to be death. In the midst of all this Watson has found love with Mary (Kelly Reilly), and plans to move out, much to Holmes' distress. They take a hiatus in crime solving, with Holmes continuing with their experiments. But the pair are thrown back into the case when Lord Blackwood seems to have risen from the grave. This becomes a threat to Watson's reputation who declared the man dead, and could lead to a revolt by Blackwood's followers. Holmes is also brought back into contact with Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams), an American theft, who he loves, and the only person to best him. She ask for his help, to find a man, a scientist. Holmes quickly finds out that this is linked to Blackwood and his people. He is thrown in even deeper when a secret society, whom leaders include the Home Secretary, the American Ambassador and a senior Judge. They want to stop Blackwood, who plays to murder to make himself more powerful.The aim of the reboot is to try and bring Sherlock Holmes to a younger audience. They want to take away all Holmes clichés like the Deerstalker Hat and Watson as a bumbling fool. Holmes becomes a man who gets very involved in action, and shows he is an inventor. It is meant to be closer to the books by Arthur Coyle Doyle: I don't know if it's true because I haven't read them. This version of Sherlock Holmes was made as an action/comedy, namely a buddy comedy. They are some decent action scenes, but some were over edited. There was also some psychical comedy, but the best comedy came from the buddy relationship between the two lead characters. Holmes and Watson are basically an old married couple, bickering throughout, but do respect each other and need each other. There are chalk and cheese, both be very different. The dialogue was key and I'm sure Robert Downey Jr. and Guy Ritchie had a hand in it.The best member of the cast was Jude Law, which is surprising. Watson is made into a straight, tough war veteran, who shows to be intelligent and has skills as a detective. He is a loyal friend to Holmes despite everything he has done. Downey is decent, and he obviously play the character against type. He gives the character a comic edge but shows that he is able to think ahead and sees clues that no ones else does. Mark Strong is a top actor, who has worked with Ritchie before; and makes an excellent villain. However he isn't given enough screen time. Rachel McAdams in 2009 has become a big star, staring in State of Play, The Time Travelling Wife and of course Sherlock Holmes. She is obviously an attractive woman and has a future ahead of her, but I thought her performance was lacking.After the success of Lock, Stock and Snatch Guy Ritchie career was seeming to heading for great things, but ends up torching himself when marrying Madonna, and making two massive floats. Divorcing Madonna was the wisest thing he did, having a partial return to form with Rocknrolla, and now he has finally done his first blockbuster. He injects energy into the action scenes, adds wit, and because of the setting there is no mockery gangsterism. He brings in his own style, I thought the slow motion bits surprisingly worked, and the flashbacks and showing of clues reminded me of his previous films.The problem with the film is the script. One of the writers was Simon Kinberg, who is one of the worst writers in Hollywood, having written XXX 2, X-Men 3 and Jumper and acted as a script doctor to Charlie Angels 2 and Fantastic Four (hardly a good CV). His aim is focus on action and not on plot. At least he was working on a screenplay already written by others first. This was written as a action film, when it should have been written as a detective film with action in it. The focus should have been the case. The plot itself isn't anything inspired and more thought should have been used to make it a tighter story. It was just a series of events leading to action sequences. The revelation at the end which is meant to lead to the sequel also felt a bit too forced. Hopefully the sequel will have better writers. The film also felt longer then 2 hours and dragged in places, especially in the beginning. Never a good sign.Overall, fairly enjoyable. I give it a 7.3 overall. I liked the dog in the film as well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"One of the most well-made films of 2009, perhaps even the decade","I certainly was curious about ""Sherlock Holmes"" as soon as I saw the first trailer for it a few months before it had been released, but I wasn't sure at all what to expect. From the looks of the trailer, it seemed it would be focused a little more on humor in the story than actual mysteries and characters, but fortunately I was wrong with that assumption. This may be my favorite movie of 2009 from what I have seen. The weird thing is, I don't consider this a GREAT movie, but a very well-executed one.Sherlock Holmes is one of those films that isn't perfect but feels like it is when you watch it. The scenery is absolutely commendable, along with the cinematography, and the score is a perfect fit for the main character and time it is set in. We all know from stories that Sherlock Holmes is a man with more than a couple problems, and the perfect man for the role was picked, Robert Downey Jr., because he considerably has had similar problems in his life. He also is a great actor with a certain type of charisma that he can only use to suit the role of Sherlock Holmes.The story is well-done and everything you see will be tested later on in the movie. Flashbacks to reveal the answers to the mysteries are nicely executed and perfect for the conclusion. The Performances are great from everybody, so there's nowhere specifically to recognize. The personification of the character by Robert Downey Jr. is also directed in a very authentic, accurate way that we can all enjoy.Overall, if you haven't seen this, it's really fun and enjoyable, the action isn't too over the top and doesn't distract from the real story, check it out, because I consider it to possibly be one of the most well-made films of the past decade.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"If Action is All You Give Them, Sooner or Later Action Will Be All They Want.","Yet another quintessential character has been dispensed through the blockbuster factory, resulting as a cutting-edge bionic man. As he is always inclined to do, Guy Ritchie saturates his biggest movie to date with stylish visuals and exaggerated characters, and a death-defying scramble atop Tower Bridge, which is unfinished. It's great for today's action fans, as well as the same 12- and 13-year-old boys we were when we first saw Lock, Stock and Snatch. This hugely liberty-taking extravaganza achieves the exotic state-of-the-art tradition of full-energy action and preposterous CGI, and Holmes and Watson do their best to adjust. Holmes discards the hat and pipe, and Watson has resolved at long last to leave the ironic harmony of Holmes' digs for the perils of married life.Holmes, way more than James Bond, Batman, Tom Ripley and the characters of Shakespeare, has endured innumerable portrayals. Robert Downey Jr., who is not the most insignificant of these. Downey's Holmes is both less restrained and in better physical shape than past personifications. Holmes' accepted fondness for cocaine is here increased by other drugs and lots of alcohol. However Holmes has the physique of a vigorous gymnast, the precision of an acrobat and the fisticuffs of Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee. He and Watson bounce effortlessly into action like Batman and Robin.In the opening sequence, the two barge forth upon the diabolical satanist Lord Blackwood, played by Mark Strong, a great actor, great at playing villains, who here is at his most awkward. They arrive as he is performing a despicable deed, and he is sent to the gallows and enclosed in his tomb, just to return evidently not dead. This mobilizes not as much of a line of astute observation, deductive reasoning and forensic skills as a succession of martial arts and mass destruction tableaux in the streets of London, which have never appeared more doomed, cloudy and foreboding. I had the feeling the Hughes brothers were filming From Hell on the other side of the block. Now I will concede that there is a particularly awesome classic-Ritchie moment that merges Holmes' masterful deduction and whiplash pugilism, super slo-mo and voice-over taking us through his logical steps of incapacitating a fight opponent, followed by a sudden blur of motion where all of that is executed. High point of the movie.After the first capture of Blackwood, Holmes retires to his abode. In recognized Sherlock lore, this is usually described as ""a period of study,"" inferring cocaine and opium fantasies. In Ritchie's version, he ravages his rooms like an inebriated coed, merely just missing old pizza boxes. This will not do. Supposedly, Sherlock is chiefly meticulous. At any rate, Blackwood's revival is just the sort of mystifying black magic front one does expect from a Holmes story, and it gives him a new inducement of life.There is also concern for two women: Rachel McAdams playing the Holmes character alleged to be the sole woman to ever reach Holmes' soft spot, and Kelly Reilly playing Watson's betrothed, who may be in for more than she realizes. The dawn of Mary on the scene throws Holmes into bitter outbursts: How dare the doctor favor a woman over his own scintillating companionship? Watson has invariably assumed proper domain elsewhere, but in this film, the intimate habitat of Holmes' place make his other rooms appear more than ever like a front.The Conan Doyle stories are still read, and likely will be forever. Most readers get to one or two. But among moviegoers of the 09-10 winter season, not so many seem likely. But it seemed to me the majority of us were nonetheless amused for a couple of hours, including myself. Ritchie, his writers and Warner Bros. simply appear to be chiefly concerned with action. That, they unfortunately believe, is all that gets young audiences into theaters today. If that's all they give them, they're going to be correct in time anyway. However, the master of deduction, who has endured so much, can surely bear with some explosions and kung fu.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Surprisingly efficient in the Holmes storyline,"I did not hold any expectations while watching this as I had heard many composite responses. Going in I felt this was going to be a LONG 2 hr film with no real substance. I walked away more than pleasantly surprised the film was directed by Guy Ritchie and produced by Joel Silver (Die Hard, Lethal Weapon), Lionel Wigram, Susan Downey, and Dan Lin. The adapted and brilliantly written screenplay, by Michael Robert Johnson, Anthony Peckham, and Simon Kinberg, was developed from a story by Wigram and Johnson.Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law portray Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson respectively Law is clever, uniquely compelling to that of Downey's prowess as Holmes. Downey's performance showcases his diverse ability to delve into a character and make it his own.. Set in 1890, eccentric detective Holmes and his companion Watson are hired by a secret society to foil a mystic and warlock style craft of magic, a sinister plot to expand the British Empire by seemingly supernatural and dark means. Rachel McAdams stars as their former adversary Irene Adler and comes across feminine nut strong for the time of the century. Mark Strong portrays villain Lord Henry Blackwood methodically and conceptually dark, almost with a devious and mystic presence.I thought the concept of the film brought a different style and approach to the legendary Scotland Yard investigator. It was well paced, and drove the characters nicely following the plot. I give it a 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Save Your Money--boring, boring, boring","What's wrong with this film?The plot line is dull and fragmented. Way too much screen time is spent on various ridiculous fight scenes. The lighting is very dark in the film, with lots of dull colors used in scene after scene. Rachel McAdams, who has a relatively small part, is the only character who offers any kind of visual color. The accents used by the actors can be hard to understand.The ending is a set-up for a second movie, but I don't expect this one will generate enough of a following to warrant a part two.Wish I could say something positive, but honestly, it's dull and not worth the time or money.

Incredible!,"Plot: Sherlock Holmes(Robert Downey, Jr.) is a well known detective in 1890's London. He and his partner, Dr. John Watson(Jude Law) have solved various mysteries/crimes, with their latest being the subduing of Lord Henry Blackwood(Mark Strong), a sophisticated psycho who knows sorcery. But somehow Blackwood has survived his execution and has plans of world domination(how original). Now the case is reopened and Holmes and Watson, with the aid of Irene Addler(Rachel McAdams), who has outfoxed Holmes twice, will have to stop the sinister Blackwood before his plan is set in motion.Guy Ritchie has possibly delivered his best work yet. After gangster films like RocknRolla and Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, he might have finally found his big hit, both foreign and domestic. Downey, Jr. is hilarious as the titular sleuth. He's funny when he has to be, and smart when he has to be. That's why he rightfully deserves a Golden Globe nomination for his performance. The action is also pretty darn good, especially the slow motion close quarters fights. It's like they added some pieces of Fight Club into the movie. I also really enjoyed the score by Oscar-winning composer Hans Zimmer. His piano bits are the best parts, playing to the feel of 1800's England. The only problem is that at a few points, the movie gets a bit too smart on us. Holmes is a genius, but I'm not fully interested in his Einstein like blather.Overall, this is a well done mix of action, humor, thrills, and mystery. I give it a 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Cool New Sherlock Holmes,"Sherlock Holmes was just as good as expected, and a bit more. At 2 hours, it was a good deal that brought action, mystery, suspense, and obvious room for a sequel. Firstly, it's not exactly like the original Holmes, but modernized, and I think it's a good thing. It pulled in people of all ages - old and young, although it is a bit dark and scary for younger kids.The acting and characters were, as said before, more action-y than the stories, but it's all for that awesome effect. Robert Downy Jr. did a good job, and with Jude Law, brought in humor. The other characters were played out well.The story was interesting, and certainly had some twists, and without spoiling anything, keeps the case open for a second one. Guy Ritchie directed this nicely, and gave it a darker air than I expected. The scenes when Holmes predicted and solved riddles/enemies were very fun to watch. The mystery was too confusing for anyone to truly solve himself, but it described everything at the end. It was overall a fun, interesting movie that serves the old Sherlock Holmes well.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Great characters suffer from uninteresting plot,"I was pleasantly surprised by the performances of Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law. They had great chemistry which allowed us to really grasp their characters' personalities. They squabbled in nearly every scene, and it was great every single time. But this film has an odd story, and if you've read a single Sherlock Holmes novel, you know how it's going to end. The villain is well-played, but not truly interesting from the audience's point of view. I would certainly watch this again in the future - it is fun, funny and has a wonderful balance of action, science and detective work. They have laid down a nice foundation. I hope that in the future they invest more time in the villain's character. He is one dimensional. The story, oddly enough, is too straightforward. Some more twists and turns next time!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Good, but good improve on casting","Not bad at all! I wasn't expecting very much from this movie. The reason: Downey's eyes often lack any emotion whatsoever and Jude Law is cold as ice (most of the time). But, trying to be as objective as I can (which is impossible), they both did a great job. Perfect casting.... except for Rachel McAdams. This woman is supposed to be very smart in this movie, but every time I look at her, I don't see much intelligence at all. Sorry, I've seen too many movies and know many smart actresses - and she's not one of those (at least in this movie). My standard is Carrie Fisher or Sigourney Weaver or Jodie Foster. In others words, very smart women. McAdams just doesn't cut it. Otherwise great casting.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"excellent cast + story  + production + music = great movie, elementary, my dear Watson (Screen)","Actually, I got two motivations for this movie:First, RDJR : he got my vote since ""Iron Man"" and coming from his painful private life, I like his attitude of having seen the devil and not care!Next: Victorian London: for ages, I am attracted by this city in that time and can't really explain the reason except that my family building has flavor of that. My Christmas experience with ""Scrooge"" has been terrible, so I expected much of this one.Besides this, I knew nothing of this movie and for me, Holmes was essentially a boring Japanese cartoon depicted as a fox.That's why I came really surprised by it. Right at the opening credits, I enjoyed it: music, cast, sets, wardrobe, screenplay, everything was amazing. It was great to see again the ""Notebook"" heroin and the bad guy is totally convincing with his Andy Garcia look-alike.I haven't keep in mind how he was deductive. Here, his solving skills are a bit robotic but has a tremendous impact. As a detective, the plot he has to solve is really imaginative and Sir Conan Doyle would have approved. But I admit to be a bit dumb being unable to guess the mysterious boss behind all this. I really like the old London because you can see the most incredible wealth being close to tremendous poverty.For the fun, I played Holmes leaving the theater. Near my place, I found a scarf.

"Not bad, but not what I was hoping for","This movie provides one of the scenarios where the credits look better than the movie. When I first saw the trailer, I began to look forward to seeing Sherlock Holmes. I enjoyed the quick-witted dialogue interspersed with seemingly random flairs of action.If only the movie had been this good. Granted, I didn't hate it either, and I saw after seeing the two best movies of 2009, Avatar and The Road, so my expectations were a little bit higher as well. However, these expectations aren't insurmountable, as long as q movie is successful in what it aims to do. Sherlock Holmes does not accomplish this. At least, not completely.The best bits of dialogue were already shown in the trailer. Throughout the movie, Robert Downey spoke in a monotonous mumble, that I, as well as the other movie-going sleuths, often had to decipher for ourselves. That's not to say Downey Jr. Was bad. On the contrary, the bittersweet relationship between Holmes and Watson was the most engaging part of the script.The plot began interestingly enough, but it was bogged down by the plodding sameness of the scenery, and the obvious sequel set-up. By the end, I found myself wondering why Guy Ritchie had chosen to devote so much time into preparing a sequel that he forgot to pay attention to the script that was in front of him.Without Downey and Law, this movie would have been a total waste of money. As it is, save your money for a movie more worth your time (Avatar, anyone?), and go see Sherlock in a second-run theater, or better yet, as a rental from Blockbuster.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
A Great Surprise,"I (like most people) saw the trailer for this movie and saw a great literary character in a ridiculous action flick. I predicted action clichés and poor story lines that any idiot could follow, with one clever little twist at the end when Holmes (inevitably) figures it out.I was pleasantly surprised and exceptionally pleased when I actually saw the movie. Yes, there are a lot of action sequences, but they don't distract too much from the plot, and even they are integrated into this whole new world of Sherlock Holmes. We really see the world as someone like Holmes would see it; with compulsive attention to those little details Holmes is so famous for noticing, everywhere. We understand why he's so hard to work with, and why he spends so little time in the outside world. Every time Holmes opens his mouth, there's a lot of thought put into what he says. A big round of applause goes to Robert Downey Jr., an incredible actor who is finally getting the kind of recognition he deserves. It may be a mainstream role, but you can still see that a lot of work went into his interpretation of Sherlock Holmes. He's quirky, he's odd, he's as antisocial as they come (but Lord knows it's not from shyness), and he's got the fastest mind of any movie character I've ever seen. Walking out of this movie, I was just convinced that Sherlock Holmes was the Greatest Detective in history; that there was no case he could not solve.Praise also goes to Jude Law as Dr. Watson, but not the bumbling Watson we all think of. Law makes a perfect foil to Downey, both as a character and as an actor. Law is straightforward, a versatile actor, although not quite a great actor. He sticks to formality as a general rule, and tries to make sure everyone else does. He's very professional and thus very marketable. Downey is well known for being unpredictable and a bit crazy, as well as quirky through the nose. We watch him to see how above-and-beyond he'll go. They make a perfect team, on and off screen.This is an exceptionally entertaining film, and believe me when I say you'll remember the characters and the plot more than the action sequences.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

Kudos!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
It's Decent,"Just to give a little background, I have only general knowledge of Sherlock Holmes. I've read one story, I've seen references to it on movies and TV programs. So I really just have general knowledge of the mythology. That said, I though the film was decent. It's not great, but it's certainly not bad. It's just a solid decent film.Basically what they did is turn Sherlock Holmes into an Action/Adventure/Mystery Film. Purists of the stories might be a little turned off, but for the casual movie-goer, it's a good movie.GOOD STUFF The story is engaging and keeps you just curious enough to see what will happen next. There's a lot going on with the main murder-mystery plot, and several good character driven sub-plots.I think Robert Downey Jr. is excellent as Sherlock Holmes. I liked his portrayal of the character as an extremely intelligent social misfit who is respected by all, but has a general attitude of distaste for those around him (with a few exceptions). The rest of the acting is decent, and succeeds in getting you interested enough in the characters to see what will happen next.I really liked the creative uses of deductive logic, not just to solve mysteries, but in fight scenes and everyday situations. In this adaptation, Holmes is able to use deductive reasoning in hand-to-hand combat to create the best scenario for disabling an opponent. I thought this was an interesting twist and a cool addition to the character. I loved the way the deductive logic scenes were shot, too. It shows a slow motion explanation of everything Holmes is planning to do so that you can see the logic behind the actions. He calculates every move in advance based on his opponent's weaknesses, then he calculates recovery time and psychological impact on his opponent. After this slow-motion explanation, you get to see the whole thing in real time, and it's really f***ing cool to watch the logical explanation, and the process behind the fight before seeing the scene in real-time.The resolution to the mystery is satisfying, and it's exactly how you would want to see a Sherlock Holmes-style mystery unravel. I won't go into detail, I'll just say it's not ridiculous, and that it's based in logic and deductive reasoning.NOT SO GOOD STUFF While I liked most of the performances in the film, I had a hard time seeing Jude Law as Watson. I don't think its anything the actor did wrong, I just think it was a casting misstep. When I think Watson, the first thing that comes to mind is not ""ass-kicking bodyguard."" I was able to overlook it for the most part, but in the back of my head I was just going, ""That's not Watson."" It just doesn't seem natural to me.There was also an issue with me where the clues are not really given much screen time or attention. Part of the fun of a mystery is trying to solve it, and seeing how the pieces come together; but the way the film is edited, you really can't see the ending coming, and it's more just Holmes explaining rather than giving the audience actual clues to think about.The ending also threw me a little with the final confrontation with the villain. I'll just say on this that it gets a little cliché, and someone survives something without a scratch that that person really shouldn't just walk off without at least a bruise. However, it's not NEARLY as ridiculous as Indy's magical fridge of wonders.For the most part, the CG is cool, except for a few scenes at the end where you can tell it's not real. This is relatively minor, though.OVERALL The film is decent. It's worth a look if you just want to see a good, solid film that isn't too heavy or too deep. It's a decent Hollywood action-adventure comedy.7/10 - A few stumbling points, but overall decent. Recommend for casual movie-goers. Hardcore fans of the books and stories might get p*ssed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

Consume Caffine Prior to Watching,"Although a technically competent movie, it has the elements of a suspenseful thriller, but none of the thrills. The climax is flat and disappointing. When I compare this to the original Sherlock Holmes movies, or even the Holmes/Moriarty episodes of Star Trek Next Generation it has none of the charm or the mystery. Whatever mystery there is, is overpowered by the coldness of the film. The villain does some interesting things as if he is in league with the devil, but in the end Holmes rapid revelation of how everything was accomplished was not presented in a satisfying way.The actors Downy, Law, and Adams (who I've liked in previous movies) seem to do an adequate job with what they are given but none of them are likable, especially Holmes. Partial blame must go to the overall story atmosphere. I have read many of the original Holmes novels and may be a victim of my preconceived notions of just who Holmes is. I can only guess, but it seems like the Director's vision for this story (cold and gritty) and Sherlock Holmes's personality in combination with Downy's portrayal just turned me off, all most a reminder of the actor's troubled past. I may be evoking a standard some will disagree with but first and foremost, I want to like Sherlock Holmes.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

"Elementary, my dear Watson. Now, watch as I kick this guy's butt!","Guy Ritchie's take on 'Sherlock Holmes (2009)' is probably his best film to date (although 'Snatch (2000)' comes very close), and it's also one of his least 'Guy Ritchie' movies. This version of the eponymous detective and his cane-wielding colleague is very hard to square away with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's initial creations, and the whole feature feels as though it's been cranked up to eleven. Sherlock Holmes isn't supposed to be cool, but this version seems frightened of portraying him as anything else. He's far more charismatic and likable than he perhaps ought to be. Furthermore, he's a veritable action hero here, using his incredible intellect not only to deduce (and, as it would happen, seduce), but also to cripple his opponents for life. Dr. Watson, too, makes excellent use of the training he received while working as a soldier, kicking ass almost as efficiently as his slow-mo-seeing buddy. To be fair, there are still plenty of sequences where Sherlock does actual detective work, and the broad strokes of the character are certainly recognisable. The mystery he finds himself dealing with here strikes a good balance between being local and having more global implications, while also suggesting that there may be some spooky goings on here and there. The latter element adds a specific texture to the picture, and it's fun to see Sherlock debunk the various otherworldly things he comes across (even if he's never really forced to consider the possibility that said things could really be supernatural). This is popcorn entertainment in every sense of the word, something with big stars and plenty of action and a story that's may be twisty but is ultimately easy to follow. That's not a bad thing, either, because it means the movie is as easy to watch as it is to enjoy. As far as blockbusters go, this is pretty good. It's engaging and entertaining and includes a handful of undeniably iconic moments (the slow-motion segments, particularly the fight with the handkerchief, are still seared in my brain from the first time I watched this). It's well-made stuff that puts a smile on your face.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

Casting Downey as Holmes was a masterstroke! I appreciate this more after reading his biography. I must call out the excellent sets, costumes & music. Although these lurk in the background these add to the mood & pace of the movie. The end of the movie clearly gives a hint of a 2nd part, which indeed was released in 2011, equally exciting! Set in 1891, Sherlock Holmes & his colleague, Dr. Watson successfully arrest the aristocratic serial killer & occult practitioner Lord Blackwood to close their latest case. But when Blackwood supposedly walks out of his grave, all hell breaks loose. Holmes is hired by a secret society to investigate into the matter, only to discover that his nemesis has been planning a more sinister plot all along.

After that, he was cast as Arthur Conan Doyle's prized character creation, Sherlock Holmes. Guy Ritchie came in as the director of the film and Jude Law was cast as Dr. John Watson. Ritchie and his team of screenwriters, fashion-out a story about Holmes, that is of the highest energy level possible for the super sleuth. The man who solves crimes with expert deductive reasoning, can see a crime scene as it unfolds in his mind. He also uses his fantastic reasoning, so he can see his next 20 moves into the future and he is a master of forensics. Holmes receives a super-charged, modern day reboot.It is a major step for a character created way back in 1887 by British author, Arthur Conan Doyle. It is those two important aspects of the equation, that establishes the time period and setting of this film, in this case 1890 London. It is encouraging to see, that they chose to stay in the 19th century for this film, considering how powerfully charged this film rolls along. It has that feeling of the futuristic. You would think the filmmakers would want to go with a modern day approach. I'm so glad they didn't. In a nutshell, Holmes and Watson have to stop the evil machinations of a cult-leader, political influencer, Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong), before he can destroy all of London. It's interesting to note also, that Law, eventually would join the MCU with Captain Marvel (2019). Also in the cast, as Holmes' love interest, is Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler, who also is an MCU alumni (the Dr. Strange movies (2016 & 2022). I mention these tie-ins with the MCU, because Ritchie manages to harness that comic book energy, for a character that really isn't that type of character. Ritchie does it successfully, without making Holmes or the direction of the story, look ridiculous. We buy into the change in direction they decide to go with in depicting this character.The story, the performances by the cast, the unique way of showing Holmes's talents (superpowers?) and the overall pacing of this film, makes it a very entertaining one to see. Ritchie has a style, that he has shown in his other films, that really make his films artistic. He does the same thing here, but he develops a style that works for this movie and thankfully for this version of Sherlock Holmes. The editing choices, film tricks and CGI placement is top notch, beautifully produced and the action is incredible. Robert Downey JR. Was born to be Sherlock Holmes too, at least, this version of the character. I don't think this approach to the character would have worked for Basil Rathbone's version. Those films had their own charm, while they dazzled audiences, during Hollywood's golden age. This film manages to use the energy of the modern film, but is able to capture the essence of this classic character.9.1 (A- MyGrade) = 9 IMDB.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Holmes Is Actually Quite Good.,"Sherlock Holmes makes it to the big screen with the help of Guy Ritchie with his first real Hollywood film. Robert Downey Jr. is the titled character, this time playing up more of the bad boy attitude. This role is similar to the recent Iron Man films, as both Holmes and Stark are egotistical geniuses with a substance abuse problem. Does life imitate art?Robert Downey Jr brings that same quick wit and attitude that we loved him for in Iron Man to Holmes and he plays of really well with Jude Law. The two have better chemistry than the supposed romantic relationship. The bromance between the two is one of the highlights in the film. Law, as Watson, brings his comedic skills to light as he tries to be the level headed one of the group. Rachel McAdams is the Irene Adler, the only person to get the best of Holmes. She is likable, as always and even though the relationship doesn't match what the boys have, it's still good enough to get a pass by me.The film is more action oriented than what one would think a Sherlock Holmes film would be. But to my surprise, Holmes in the books did know martial arts. So in a weird way, it fits. I don't know how I feel about the slow motion sequences, but that's just a few technical nit picks here and there that don't really affect the overall story of the film.Blackwood, the villain, played by the guy who seems to love the evil roles, Mark Strong. He uses black magic to try and get what he wants, something that Holmes doesn't believe in and this truly tests his theories and beliefs. Blackwood is caught at the beginning of the film and sentence to hang, but mysteriously rises from the grave days later. He is out to kill again and Holmes must stop him.It's popcorn entertainment and exactly the type of performance one would expect from Robert Downey Jr. Ritchie handles the Hollywood budget well and gives us one of his better films as of late. I'm just happy he's not trying to recapture the Lock Stock and Snatch glory days anymore.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Nothing escapes him ... !!,"Rob Downey Jr is back .... and how !! I knew I had to get my hands on those movie tickets as soon as soon as I first caught glimpse of the trailer. Being a huge fan of Doyle's work, I'm a big fan of Holmes. I own a lot of those BBC movies of Sherlock Holmes' different cases. Since I watched the making of the movie special on TV, I knew that this is not about any of Holmes' exploits penned by Doyle, rather this one is written by Lionel Wigram and Michael Robert Johnson.This movie stars Robert Downey Jr. as the world's greatest detective himself and Jude Law as the surgeon, war veteran and above all Holme's faithful companion Dr. John Watson. Rachael McAdams is Irene Adler and Mark Strong , Lord Blackwood.Directed by Guy Ritchie, this movie dares to explore parts of Holmes' individuality where the earlier movies and serials failed to venture. Voracious Holmes readers would know from the books that in spite of having the best deduction abilities anyone could ever have, he was a total mess.He would often need someone to shake him back in touch with the world or else, him and his legendary pipe, would have a field day, deep in his thoughts out of which he may not emerge back too soon. Besides that, readers would also know that Holmes was a great boxer, superb at martial arts ( read Jiu Jitsu , which he used to throw Proff. Moriearty off the waterfall in the return of Sherlock Holmes story ), had a thing for Irene Adler (A Scandal in Bohemia) and lived at 221B Baker Street, London.This movie shows Holmes boxing, kicking butt, living in a mess and often requiring constant wake up calls from the good doctor. The Victorian London has been depicted impeccably with the dark environment, pebbled roads, the sound of hoofs a horse carriage would make, the rains, the puddles and the unfinished bridges.Now those of us, who grew up watching those BBC specials of Sherlock Holmes (without much reading the unabridged stories), would have a hard time relating this movie to what BBC had fed us in the form of Sherlcok Holmes movies for years because they had neither the resources nor the conviction to portray that side of Holmes which made him more of a human. They would rather just stick to showing how extraordinarily well he was about almost everything.Wel I do admit, the characters in the movie were not too much like what Sir Doyle etched in his books. Robert Downey Jr.'s Holmes was not the tall, thin pointy nosed excuse for an individual. Nor was Dr Watson, the bumbling fool which Nigel Bruce popularized in the 1930-40s films. Jude Law's Watson was fast, fierce, knowledgeable (no match for Holmes however) and quite the fighter which one would need to be if one were to get caught in the situations that following Holmes would lead you in.So I believe, that most franchises were changing their look to suit today's audience, this movie , very cleverly utilized the uncharted territory of Holmes' character and used a different story altogether to prevent fans from knowing the end and in process bring in more people. Now this is a movie both of masses and the classes.I seriously recommend this movie to about everyone.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Good entertainment,"I gave an above average note to this film, as it provided for an enjoyable evening in the company of some friends. It was definitely not your usual entertainment movie. Not every one of those take place in the 1860s London.I liked the historical recreation of the city, it was very subtle, meaning no direct lines indicating to the world-ruling Empire of the time. It stayed in the background, but powerfully so.The plot itself is intriguing, fitting for a detective story. I think it'd be very wrong to search for comparisons with the Sherlock from the books. This is not the purpose of a movie, which is always limited in time and expression. The film has many surprises and twists. It'll nail you on the couch at times. But I've got to say - it's nothing more than entertainment for an evening with some snacks.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Swashbuckling London Duo,"I was somewhat trepidatious as I hit the ""play"" button on the DVR for this video entree. Would this be a Guy Ritchie explosion of madcap high-jinks with little or no homage to the old Basil Rathbone/Nigel Bruce style of the mid 20th century? Yet, alas, I got both: a wild and woolly Holmes and Watson, both adept martial art practitioners in our version here, and a decidedly deductive and intellectually astute Holmes, portrayed exquisitely by R. Downey, Jr. Dr. Watson's character also gets no short shrift here as J. Law adds logic, subtle wit and resourcefulness to his character, much unlike the rather bungling and shortsighted character of N. Bruce's rendition. This is neither a knock on Mr. Bruce, as his raison d'etre was precisely to be a counterpoint to the ever-so-shrewd Holmes of yore, nor on the old Sherlock Holmes episodes in general. This new version is fresh and invigorating, yet it doesn't diminish my appreciation of those most enjoyable episodes with B. Rathbone and N. Bruce at the helm.So enter the madcap yet logical progressions of events ever so deftly conjured up by G. Ritchie and Co. A truly visual and poignant unfolding of a most clever story line mixed in with superior visual effects and creative casting make this a treat to watch. One most probably will have to view this film several times (I did!) before all the hints, tricks and flashback clues are assimilated and digested... but that's where the ""Rewind"" button comes in handy!So Kudos for all, as too many names would require ""shout-outs"" to list here in this most captivating adaptation. In closing, my only question is: Do I see a ""Moriarty"" looming on the horizon?? He never seems too far away!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Downey's Sherlock not just Elementary,"Since I like Robert Downey Jr. so much (especially his post-recovery incarnation), I had to exercise a bit of self-control in keeping my rating to a more modest 7 stars rather than an immodest 8 stars.Guy Ritchie has directed a solid film featuring a vision of Holmes that adheres to Arthur Conan Doyle's original vision: brilliant, eccentric, unkempt, and erratic. But unlike Billy Wilder with /The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes/(1970), Ritchie -- perhaps out of respect for Downey Jr's real-life recovery -- is reticent about one aspect of the famous detective's personality: his penchant for recreational drugs.The movie has a pretty good -- if also pretty predictable -- story-line centered on exposing the occult, i.e., the revealing of things hidden. The appeal of the Holmes genre is not the surprise plot twist (after all, if one is constantly expecting a plot twist, then one can hardly call it a surprise when the next plot twist turns up). Instead, the appeal of the books and films lies in the satisfaction received from learning just how Sherlock deduces the truth behind each and every mystery. That Downey Jr.'s Holmes gets to the truth in elementary fashion is certainly part of the appeal of this film.Still more appealing is the way in which Downey Jr. conveys the conflicting emotions that underlie Sherlock's stiff upper lip. Even though the film follows a narrative arc that requires no character depth or development, Downey Jr. provides both. The same cannot be said for Jude Law's Dr. Watson, but that's not Law's fault: the film (as with the entire genre) is not about Dr. Watson, after all. In fact, Law does a fine job in the supporting role.On the other hand, Rachel McAdams is miscast in the role of femme fatale, unable to hold her own in matching Downey Jr.s considerable acting chops. As for the antagonists, none are compelling, with the main villain, Lord Blackwood -- a sort of watered-down Anton LaVey -- being the least compelling of all. Fortunately, Blackwood won't be a main character in the sequel; let's hope the same is true for McAdams.Perhaps the most significant accomplishment of this latest addition to the Sherlock Holmes movie corpus is the way in which it captures London in the last decades of the 1800's. With the Tower Bridge (in the process of being built) serving as both backdrop and stage, the viewer's vicarious experience of Victorian-era England rivals that of any cinematized Jane Austen novel.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Sherlock Holmes for the brain-dead,"By-passing the outraged and ignorant who seem to think the only Holmes is the one played so well by Basil Rathbone many years ago, this movie nonetheless lacks a great deal of entertainment value, and treats the audience as if they were dim-wits. Having said that, I am delighted that Watson is portrayed as something other than a bumbling foil, but more of Jude Law's role later.The quantity of expository dialog grates after the first few minutes, and the attempts to show Holmes' thinking by using voice-overs becomes tedious. There are better ways of doing this, but if you're pitching at a CSI-style audience (as a retired forensic scientist, I can assure you all that we do not lean on our instruments, and discuss the basic principles of their function with each other), then perhaps the laziness or ineptness of the script-writer(s) is understandable.Downey appears to be reprising his role as Stark in Iron Man, but with Jude Law as his near-constant companion just to provide some modicum of variety.The action comes quickly, and with little let-up, but this is no handicap to the enjoyment. The somewhat washed-out colors and the fact the scenes are almost always in dim locations means much of the movement is hard to discern in the gloom and surely action needs to be clearly seen? The sets themselves show obvious artifacts of cgi and after pieces like Gladiator and more recently the brilliant Avatar, the audience is left feeling either budgets prevented the job being done properly or more dangerously, that the studio didn't care, thinking the drawcards of Holmes, Downey and Law were sufficient.Though Downey tries hard, it is Law who comes across as more convincing and is the focus of attention whenever the two are together. His portrayal is the highlight of the movie. The lowlight is, obviously, the handcuffed Downey, naked on the bed with only a teddy-bear for modesty. This is US-sit-com stuff and the fact such a tired, clichéd scene features heavily in previews shows the utter lack of imagination the scriptwriters put into their work. And of course, the giant who wreaks mayhem and is near-invincible has been done to death. Is it such a crime to bring something new to the audience?The climax was both predictable and tedious, but thankfully has one recommendation: it showed the end was near. There are many movies where the talents of the cast are wasted. Sadly, this can so easily be added to the list, and must be done so immediately.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Great Detective ACtion-Comedy,"Sometimes you don't want to watch a film, but desperately need to be a part of the world it is in.Victorian London + 19th Century + Detectives + Steampunk + RDJ + Rachel McAdams + SherlockI couldn't ask for anything more from Guy Ritchie.This is a really really fun mystery action film that may get a little lost in the middle with its plot but otherwise provides a satisfying Sherlock Holmes adaptation.Perfectly cast, gorgeous production design, witty script, impressive action, great chemistry between the leads, and a beautiful score.The weakest aspects may be the villain, with no fault to Mark Strong, and the times where the story gets too convoluted in traditional Holmes fashion (something the tv series struggled with too), but it ends on a high note.Worth revisiting in the future for RDJ's performance alone, and Rachel McAdams ofcourse.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
The Only True Representation of Sherlock Holmes on Big Screen,"Let's just say that I could've never thought of a better cast for this movie. Also, I cannot mention the fact that Sherlock in this movie is shown from realistic perspective, the way he was portrayed and intended to be felt throughout the original stories. I like how this movie creates mystic, supernatural and at times confused emotions throughout the movie, while tying all these emotions into a scientific and logical explanation at the end. This search of logical explanation throughout the movie keeps you on edge and makes you question everything that you are seeing. Robert's character unveils in a unique way, through jokes, sarcasm and his thought process. Can only say great things about this movie and wish it has gotten more attention at the time of its release. One may compare it to the Sherlock Holmes TV series, however, I must say that it is a little bit harder to put a story of Sherlock Holmes into a one big picture, all while keeping the audience on edge throughout the picture.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Fine Resurrection,"Jude Law and Robert Downey Jr have a great chemistry and their opponent Mark Strong does play his part fine too.

No doubt, this one and the second movie are a great joy if you like such kind of movies and I have really high hopes for the third one that is in the making (at least I read so somewhere). On the side of The Man from U. N. C. L. E those Sherlock Holmes movies are my most favorite ones directed by Guy Ritchie.

Downey should have been nominated!,"Robert Downey Jr. does an excellent job in playing the difficult, complicated role of Sherlock Holmes. Jude Law is perfect as Dr. John Watson. The rest of the cast is first rate as is the costume designs and art direction which is set in the mid 1860s. The story of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson always is a mystery. Dr. Watson is planning on moving and marrying lovely girl named Mary. Rachel McAdams plays a pivotal role in this story. There are a few funny scenes like Holmes waking up naked and cuffed by the scared maid and the bantering between Holmes and Watson whose relationship is never really explained. They say goodbye to notorious killer Lord Blackwood who is executed and promised to have three more dead. The script here needs some work and some of the stuff like Holmes' brilliance is hard to digest but it's an enjoyable adventure of a film. I still think Downey should have been nominated for an Academy Award for this performance.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"""In another life, Mr Holmes, you would have made a great criminal""","I'm a huge Sherlock Holmes fan; not quite enough to be a Baker Street Irregular, but I consider Arthur Conan Doyle's short stories to be among the best entertainment that literature has to offer, and Holmes to be one of the medium's most memorable creations. Upon hearing that Guy Ritchie would helm the latest Sherlock Holmes adaptation, my first reaction was that of trepidation. Though I did enjoy 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998)' and 'Snatch (2000),' I couldn't quite see Ritchie's style being suitable for the material. My concerns were well- grounded, but overstated. 'Sherlock Holmes (2009)' has extremely little to do with Conan Doyle's original prose, but, considered simply as an action movie set in the nineteenth century, the film manages to be a lot of fun. After all, Holmes has seen worse injustices bestowed upon him: let's not forget that Basil Rathbone's Universal films were set in the modern day, and recast Holmes as a Nazi-fighting spy!The year is 1891, and London lives in fear. Aristocrat Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) has been murdering women in grotesque rituals of human sacrifice. Even following his capture by Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey, Jr.) and Dr Watson (Jude Law), the sinister Blackwood pledges to return, even after death, to continue his work. Uncharacteristically for a Sherlock Holmes story, Ritchie's film relies very strongly on a sense of the supernatural: its screenplay, to me, more closely resembled Agatha Christie's ""The Pale Horse,"" in which supernatural happenings are cunningly simulated by purely rational means. This clever device may be deliberately denouncing Conan Doyle's interest in spiritualism, which, in his declining years, gained prominence in such novels as ""The Land of Mist (1926)."" Despite the protests of close friend Harry Houdini, Conan Doyle remained a vocal exponent of spiritualism for the remainder of his life. Perhaps the great author, as Holmes might have suggested, should have taken greater note of the details.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

"Bad adaptation, bad movie","Yes, sure, the Holmes character in Doyle's original was a skilled fighter, enjoyed opium, and could be quite prickly. I don't think that justifies this treatment of him as a scruffy, debauched, out-of-control lout, constantly in and out of brawls and prison. The angry, irritable Watson character here has little in common with the sycophantic Watson of the books and stories, who devoted his life to chronicling Holmes' remarkable mind. This is 21st century version of Holmes owes more to Bruce Willis and Mel Gibson movies than to Conan Doyle.There are far too many fights and chase scenes here, far too little ratiocination. The plot of this story is also unworthy of Doyle -- an attempt to turn the murders and intrigues of the original stories into a vast, dark Da Vinci Code conspiracy.It's as though they cobbled this together using focus groups and formulas. Take one part National Treasure, one part Bond movie, combine with Lethal Weapon, insert special effect etc.Despite all the noise and action, I was constantly bored. I turned the movie off several times, had a hard time seeing it through to the end. (Another annoying thing: Though Downey does a creditable British accent, he mumbles constantly. You will need a good sound system to make out his words. And no, the problem is not the authenticity of his accent. Jude Law is quite easy to understand.)Somewhere in between the starchy Holmes character played by Jeremy Brett and the dumb buddy-cop version here lies the true character.I would not recommend this movie to anyone of any age at any time.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

A fast and furious modern version of Sherlock Holmes,"One can't help but enjoy the performance of Robert Downey, Jr. in this film. His persona, with all its quirkiness, is funny and entertaining. But the idea that he could be the Sherlock Holmes of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's day and writing is a far stretch. The inclusion of Jude Law as Dr. John Watson adds greatly to the plot and enjoyment. Although he's a counter-character to Holmes, he's also adept at crime-solving, shooting and fighting. Of course, all of the latter is mostly out of character of the ""real"" Holmes and Watson. For, their brains, cunning and sleuthing were the modus operandi of the original characters.After seeing this film on its release in theaters, I watched it again recently on DVD. It occurred to me that the device used in this film - of short stops in the story with explanations by Holmes almost as afterthoughts, might have been intended to inform (and thereby, better entertain) a modern audience that otherwise wouldn't have grasped the perception that Holmes had for small details. In reading Doyle's stories, one knows Holmes' uncanny deductions from the smallest of details. And in earlier and old-time films, audiences understood this after some comment on details by Holmes. But this modern film seems to have to make the many small details clear as a significant part of the story. After a bit, that seems childish and silly.One other observation is important to note, I think. All of the CGI and high definition filming in this story makes the setting seem unreal - as if created for stage or film. I get the sense of something being unreal often with CGI. But here, the sharp detail and contrasts of black and white in street scenes gives them the appearance of being lifted off the pages of comic books.While I found this film entertaining, it seems something of a letdown in story telling today. Hollywood apparently has to add lots of action in the form of fights, brawling, chases and conflagrations, in order to appeal to modern audiences -- even with classical and historical characters and stories. It's too bad, because with such modernizing of stories, I think the public loses out on the educational aspects of grasping the people, places, cultures and conditions of times past.This is a fast and furious modern version of Sherlock Holmes. For those who enjoy mysteries in more realistic portrayals and conditions, I heartily recommend the wonderful series of TV films of the 1980s and 1990s that starred Jeremy Brett as Holmes and Edward Hardwicke as Dr. Watson.Here are a couple favorite lines from this film.Sherlock Holmes, ""It's a matter of professional integrity. No girl wants to marry a doctor who can't tell if a man's dead or not.""Sherlock Holmes, after taking a deep breath, ""Ah, putrefication!"" (sic)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

Little details make this a great film,"(This is more of an analysis than a review but I won't spoil anything)I watched this again recently and I picked up a lot of little details I didn't notice before. To be honest I completely underestimated this film. I thought this was going to be a superhero movie with unrealistic or overplayed cliché ridden plot devices. There are a few aspects of his character that are dramatized, however he isn't portrayed to be perfect or some inhuman divine being. He has flaws and weaknesses that help develop his character. More importantly he doesn't appear to be all-knowing which would make his partner, Dr. Watson, a useless character. Aside from a few moments of ""how does he figure that out"" the only time you'll question realism would be the fighting. Sherlock isn't said to be a great fighter however he's incredibly smart and plans out what he does in combat. To an almost perfect level of prediction but they don't focus too much on fighting, it's equally balanced with the detective segments. You might also enjoy the dialog and well placed humor.Another plot device I expected was the damsel in distress who needed to be saved and carried throughout the film. The woman in the movie is named Irene Adler and she's the only person who has ever outsmarted him. Considering how incredibly smart Sherlock comes off as that says a lot about her character. To him she's simply called ""the woman"" out of spite due to her ability to challenge him, but deep down she's the one who got away. I like seeing strong female characters, especially when they're not overly aggressive about it. She knows she's a free spirited and independent woman who doesn't need to step all over men to prove it. Writers tend to make these characters seem resentful of men that just come off as if they're nothing but a cold shoulder.Dr. Watson is also a well written character. At first it might seem like Sherlock is bad company but we get details of their relationship through actions. Watson clearly enjoys their adventures and he's having a hard time shifting into a more stable life. He isn't a saint who's above Sherlock and he doesn't act like it. Both of them share a mutual respect for each other and their skills which go together to create a very effective team. I did question the fact that he's a doctor who handle himself in an outnumbered fight, but they explain he was an extraordinary soldier who fought in the Second Anglo-Afghan War.To me the characters are the most important aspects. When movies have bad characters the story will fall apart. We won't be invested or care too much what happens. We see their struggles and want to watch them pull through. So with the important aspects out of the way I would like to mention the writing. Every plot point, character development, conflict and resolution is carefully detailed to make for one amazing story. They cover their plot devices and stay true to the dramatic principle of Chekhov's Gun. The story makes sense all the way through and as a man of logic myself I loved the dramatic reveal at the end (which I won't give away). If you know a little about science you might notice a lot of the detective work actually makes sense. They don't invent a bunch of words or compounds to explain everything. Not everything is 100% accurate but it's a lot more accurate than I was expecting.Simply brilliant.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

A disappointing film,"I am an great admirer of Robert Downey Jr and he acts very well in this film but Sherlock Holmes he is not.This is not a good film. It is equally as bad as ""Where are the Morgans?"" that I had the misfortune to see a few nights ago. Where is the film industry going? I watched Wallander with Kenneth Branagh on TV a couple of nights ago. That is great writing, great acting and great cinematic photography. Entrancing. That is the standard we are looking for. As a film Sherlock Holmes is comprehensively not even third rate. It takes a lot of talent to make even a bad film. There is lot of talent and money on display but a bad film this is.The script is amateurish; no sense of onward momentum within scenes and from one scene to the next. Did anyone read an elementary book on screen writing? It is Dan Brown without the story-telling ability, the characterization and the inventiveness. Guy Ritchie, what has happened to you? Amazing special effects but all very noisy and incoherent. Give it a miss. It is two hours long but the middle hour seems like three.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Carl the Critic: Sherlock Holmes,"Guy Ritchie is the British equivalent of Stephen Spielberg here in the US. He has great talent, he works with big named actors and the movies he makes are usually successful because everyone knows who he is. But unlike Spielberg, Ritchie is a film maker that is know as a formalist, where the film is all about ""does everything look good?"", rather than the realistic style of film making where one would ask ""could this actually happen?""""Sherlock Holmes"" is a perfect example of this, because you don't care if the story good, (if there really was one, it just seemed too labyrinth like, and any where you turn could get you lost or going in circles.) But a movie doesn't need a story to be good, it just needs to look good (which this film does), sound good (which this film does thanks to both the sound and music departments), and have very strong and likable actors (which this film does for the most part.)But the majority of the film was about Robert Downey Jr. kicking some hardcore butt, giant explosions, very well executed sense of humor and the overall mood of the film matched perfectly with the setting (and vice versa.)Was this film like the original Sherlock Holmes by Sir Arthur Doyle? You bet your sweet lippy it's not. Of course it is nothing like the original Sherlock Holmes, because Holmes was just an English detective, as opposed to the film where he was an English detective and at the same time an Irish Cage fighter.But that is not important! Mr. Ritchie just took Sir. Arthur's classic character and made him his own.There were a few times where I was confused, the ""story"" that the film was trying to tell got a little too detailed, and I felt that scenes where Holmes shows how he was going to beat up the other guy in slow motion step-by-step before he really beat the guy up was repetitive and pointless. But besides for that, I really enjoyed the film, and Guy Ritchie has some extraordinary talent as a film maker. I just hope he doesn't screw up the sequel to this, and Mr. Ritchie I am still waiting for the release of the sequel to ""Rock and Rolla.""",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Enjoyed casually and comfortably,"Sherlock Holmes and his partner Doctor John Watson were involved in a black magic case that took the City of London by storm. They both face complicated and dangerous situations.Directed by Guy Ritchie, Sherlock Holmes is an interesting, entertaining, and thrilling story of adventure and case-solving. Played by Robert Downey Jr., this film is a detective film that has good comedic elements. The premise of the story is interesting and unique. It is built with the narrative of the Watson character. Then there are some scenes that show how Sherlcok's thinking works in this film that is able to see clearly and in detail. An interesting film concept with a genius and meticulous portrayal of detectives even though it seems ridiculous. Combined with the well-portrayed and balanced character of John Watson who is the partner of Sherlock. The conflict of the film is well constructed. Each scene experiences heightened tension on the way to finding the truth of the case. A good completion of the film by featuring a well-explained disclosure of the case. However, the scene is explained quickly so it is a bit difficult to digest first before the next explanation is followed.Sherlock Holmes is one of the interesting detective films. The presence of Robert Downey Jr. And Jude Law is a good combination. Each has a balancing role. The film becomes interesting with a good and iconic score. The visuals shown have a slightly dark tone with a classic London-era setting. However, it makes for a good visual and looks like an ancient era.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
The Film Takes Numerous Liberties But Doesn't Stray From The True Holmes,"I understand this is supposed to be a movie review, and trust me I'll get there, but first I must uphold the movies integrity. Now, I'm just going to say that this film for lack of a better word surprised me in how accurate the character of Sherlock Holmes was to the novels. I expected the rehashed ""cleaner"" version of Holmes as seen in many of the preceding movie, but this film showed the ACTUAL Holmes that was in the novels. Yes Blackwood was definitely not so much the Blackwood from the books but a combination of Professor Raethe and the character Blackwood, but even so the film highlighted many of the characters true personalities. For instance in The Sign of The Four Holme's states, """"The amateur who fought three rounds with you at Alison's rooms on the night of your benefit four years back."" in response to his previous prize-fighting experience. I read numerous reviews from people complaining about this being a movie re-imagined for the ""MTV Age"" but I am going to tell you they did NO such thing, instead they tried to create a movie closer to the original novels. Holmes is described in the novels as a drug using fist fighter, which for the most part he definitely was here. Holmes still has all his cleverness as well making huge deductions out of small things, like the dead mans pocket watch which alludes to a sequence in The Sign of The Four.Now as a movie alone this is a fantastic film, the art direction helps uphold a sense of mystery that is always ""afoot"" in Holmes novels and helps create that Gothic feel which the Sherlock Holmes series is based off of. The action has great pacing with the plot and isn't constantly tossed in your face yet tastefully applied. The movies casting is spot on and couldn't have been done better, the actors styles mesh greatly together and you gain a true sense of camaraderie that should naturally exist between the characters. I can tell you personally as a movie goer I was constantly on the edge of my seat and never bored which is any movies goal because naturally movies are there to entertain. I was thoroughly impressed with this movie and it's accuracy to the true Holmes that Sir Conan O'Doyle had envisioned.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Ehhh.,"I want to start off by saying that as an action movie, this was just ""okay,"" but as a Sherlock Holmes movie it was the worst thing ever made. However, to enjoy it to its fullest you must pretend that it has nothing whatsoever to do with the character created by Arthur Conan Doyle. The visual aspect of the movie was excellent, stylized to make London look as bleak and godless as fit with the mood of the film. There were several cool images like opened handcuffs sliding out of smoke that a captured Holmes is supposed to be in. The bad guy is sinister and enigmatic, but not particularly ""attractive"" or charismatic. The foreshadowing by Holmes that he uses to beat people up is clever but overused in several meaningless action sequences. But the main problem was something subliminal. Similar to the repellent nature of the colors in films like ""Alexander,"" Sherlock Holmes has a color scheme that makes one drowsy. Plus, the story's not that interesting. You can watch it, but there's not much there.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Nothing great but a stylish, enjoyable film nevertheless","I have never read any of Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories but ever since I have come across the Granada series with Jeremy Brett (most of which I love), I have become fascinated with the entire Sherlock Holmes world and canon. So I was very interested in seeing this movie from the start. Although it is not the best Sherlock Holmes movie ever made, it is certainly a lot of fun.Robert Downey Jr. take on the character is not up there with the greats perhaps but it is uniquely his. His Holmes is often rude, droll, but his deductive brilliance gets him out of deadly situations.When bored he smokes opium while doing drug experiments with his dog. Jude Law makes very good young Dr.Watson as someone often bantering with Holmes and having to put up with his selfish and impulsive demeanor. On screen, Downey and Law show great chemistry as Holmes and Watson playing off each other very well. Rachael McAdams makes a good Irene Adler (a character from the story ""A Scandal in Bohemia"") and Mark Strong is strong (no pun intended) as Holmes's nemesis Lord Blackwood.The script is full energy and is able to hold your attention from start to finish moving at a quick pace. Yet, Holmes purists may have problems with the fact that this movie has more action and adventure than it does mystery (which is not to say that it doesn't have elements that keep you guessing or that Holmes doesn't use his traditional deductive methods of investigations). Sherlock Holmes has always been a cerebral hero who rarely gets into fights but the Holmes in this movie gets into a lot of them and survives many deadly encounters. Still, taken as an exercise in escapism which is what movies are for, it does succeed.The film is cleverly directed by Guy Ritchie. He gives a special look and feel to the film. In terms of pure visual design this film is something to admire. The editing is excellent and the cinematography is first rate. The production values are superb where instead of showing Victorian Era London as beautiful they present it's alleys and street corners as dingy, grimy, with the air full of industrial smog. The music score also blends in with the scenes and imagery beautifully. Without, any doubt this movie is technically well made.So this isn't a great movie nor is it the kind of film that you would want run home about. Yet, taking it for what it is, which is Sherlock Holmes combined with action and adventure, I found it enjoyable. I certainly prefer it over it's recent sequel.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
miscast mistake,"For starters, the two stars should have switched roles. Jude Law could have pulled off a Sherlock Holmes that one would have wanted to see in this movie and even in some sequels. Plus, Downey could have done Watson as a rumpled genius who gave more support than is generally known. Then, to actually have made the whole thing work, a different director, one who hasn't been marinating in the sexually confused alternate universe of Mr.Madonna, could have made a buddy movie for this age that revealed a mind meld without bedroom influences. Gee, where is Alfred Hitchcock when you need him? He knew when and how gay inferences should be used to season rather than poison a franchise-worthy film.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Visually pleasing,"As a fan of Guy Richie I was not disappointed. Mr. Richie has a great visceral eye and the production value was top notch. The lighting and the costumes were also first rate. Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law were outstanding with great chemistry while I thought Rachel McAdams was miscast. Nothing against Ms. McAdams but she is simply too young to be believable in the part. Mark Strong was fabulous as the protagonist.The pacing was a little slow at times but all in all it kept my interest. The ending was especially pleasing as Sherlock Holmes tied out all the loose ends. The great sound design also added greatly to the experience.It would be great if Guy Richie would do a series of Sherlock Holmes films.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
CSI: Victorian London meets Fight Club with a dash of Trainspotting - Superdave,"Sherlock Holmes has been played more times by more different actors than almost any other role, and director Guy Ritchie has tackled the job of revitalizing and revisioning Conan Doyle's famous detective for the Harry Potter generation with this mostly successful and diverting entertainment. In the first five minutes of the movie, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson manage to capture an English Lord who has taken up the Black Arts as part of a sinister grab for supreme political power in Victorian England. And the arrest and even hanging of the sorcerer does nothing to slow down the timetable of his master scheme. Holmes himself, as conceived by the writers and portrayed by Downey Jr., is almost the anti-Basil Rathbone: slobbish, obsessed and substance abusing, barely able to contain let alone find outlet for his vast interests and towering intellect. Unlike the dapper, arch and self-assured Rathbone, Downey Jr. is perpetually down at heels and on the verge of emotional melt-down, whipsawing between scientific experimentation and chasing criminals, and finding occasional release in back-alley bare-knuckle brawling and jags of drunkenness. It is a daring and interesting re-conception of one of the most familiar figures in literature and this portrait of Holmes is odd enough alone to keep the audience diverted while the central criminal plot unfolds. Holmes' world is dirty, fog-bound and grim to the point of being near monochromatic, a far cry from the usually spotless, glamorized Hollywood image of gas-lit London. Unexpected and recommended viewing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

An action-comedy based on a hilarious duo,"Just finished watching it, and had some good feelings, unfortunately only at the end.First of all, this is really the first Sherlock Holmes film I've seen with real, living characters. Actually, this is only partly true. Robert Downey Jr, Jude Law, and Rachel McAdams plays almost real characters, unfortunately sometimes still not enough, and the rest of the cast is just the necessary cliché.All the film long I was thinking, and that is really unfortunate, it should grab me, and it just does not happen. There were not even a single moment when I could have felt anything i.e. worrying towards the characters, not even a single emotion, except the humor.Robert Downey Jr's Sherlock Holmes really the best ever, and Jude Law's Dr. Watson is an interesting interpreting of the original character (I mean, almost nothing to do with).Although, the camera is fine, the music is sometimes quite good, and the directing is not mediocre -and not fantastic, either-, the story is a good plot but less well-written, forgettable CGI, good editing; the movie works mainly by the hilarious Downey-Law duo. The whole movie is not as interesting, entertaining as their comedy parts. This could have been a Holmes-Watson stand-up comedy...Anyway, first film I find Jude Law a watchable actor, and again, a very positive disappointment in Robert Downey Jr, despite sometimes he himself turns to be his own parody.Well, ""Guy Ritchie"" signs can be recognized in some fight scenes, what is surprising and good for the first and second time, but then just tiring and boring, the dialogs and the main duo's atmosphere is good, sometimes great, however he fails to give a dark feeling, or any drama proposition. Fortunately, it is not a typical Hollywood cheesy action pop, but the best parts -when the movie start to work at all- are these scenes.All in all, only Mr Downey makes this movie work, and worthy to watch, because of him, despite the fact, he seems to be old for this type of character...",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Here He Comes. The Funky Sherlock!,"Before thiz newest version, there were about 200 movies that brought Sherlock into the wide screen and more than 70 Actors had ever played thiz famous character. Sherlock Holmes is a well-known detective on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle novels (Which first time is published in 1887). Sherlock on thiz movie is Robert ""Iron Man"" Downey Jr., accompanied by his fellow side-kick Dr. John Watson (Jude Law). The other Cast members are Rachel McAdams and Mark Strong. At a glance, Downey Jr. doesn't seem to care how to perform Sherlock authentically. Otherwise, he just acts naturally with his own style and just has fun with his version of Sherlock. As we know, Sherlock is a calm, discreet and charismatic person. But in the end, I think viewers will also agree to put aside the original Sherlock for a while, because thiz version is surprisingly enjoyable. In overall, the movie is entertaining enough and hilarious at the same time. The Director is Guy Ritchie. Ritchie is previously known as indie Director, his best works are ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" (1998) and ""Snatch"" (2000). The storyline of thiz movie is kind of exciting at the beginning, a little lame in the middle, and it's closed by an appropriate twist of ending. After watching thiz movie, it comes to my mind, Downey Jr's version of Sherlock resembles with Will Smith's ""Wild Wild West"" (1999). But we have to admit that thiz movie is way more mature.

The Game's Afoot,"Sherlock Holmes was a brilliant blend of a clever script, wonderful visual effects, and stellar acting. This movie came together quite nicely under the direction of Guy Ritchie. The Robert Downey Jr. Version of Sherlock Holmes is a bit more unkempt than what we are used to, but no less perceptive and intelligent. His accomplice, Dr. John Watson (Jude Law) was indispensable even if he was preoccupied with his engagement to his fiance Mary Morstan (Kelly Reilly).Holmes and Watson were tasked with solving the mystery of Lord Blackwood's escape from a crypt. Yes, Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) was supposed to be dead, yet somehow he escaped from his crypt and began enacting a plan to take over England via a secret society.

Sherlock Holmes goes hyperkinetic action with impossible CGI,"In Victorian London, Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) & Dr. Watson (Jude Law) enter into a clash of wits and brawn with a serial killing Lord involved in black magic who, apparently, has risen from the dead (Mark Strong). Rachel McAdams and Kelly Reilly play the women in the protagonists' lives.Directed by Guy Ritchie, ""Sherlock Holmes"" (2009) takes Arthur Conan Doyle's popular Victorian detective and successfully morphs him into an action hero with rapid-fire dialogues and over-the-top thrills. It's like an old Hammer flick on steroids, but it works as long as you can keep up with the snappy dialogues, which are often mumbled by Downey Jr. (so you'll have to listen closely or use the subtitles).The interesting thing about the character of Sherlock Holmes is his talent for making sweeping deductions based on the slightest details and this flick highlights that to amusing effect, like when Holmes easily assesses Watson's fiancé at the restaurant (which is one of the movie's best scenes). Speaking of the ladies, both Rachel McAdams and Kelly Reilly really shine here.The film runs 2 hours, 8 minutes, and was shot in England.GRADE: B.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
A Little Shallow But Very Entertaining,"Being a fan of previous Guy Ritchie directed films like Snatch and RocknRolla, my expectations were high for his first, in my opinion, mainstream film. He did not disappoint. His trademark frenetic style has been toned down a bit for a wider audience but it is still a delightful visual feast. The script is tight and quick paced, weaving a complex and ultimately satisfying mystery while still creating likable and three dimensional protagonists. The performances are excellent across the board with the exception of an underwhelming performance by Strong as Blackwood. To be fair though, he is a great actor in other projects but the character does not make for the best villain. It's much less his fault than it is the character's. Of special note is the Han Zimmer's score. I'm usually not one to notice original scores in films but his compositions always made me smile whenever they were featured. They were very spirited and whimsical and fit the tone perfectly. With an ending obviously open for a sequel, there is no doubt more to follow, and I plan to be there on opening night.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Don't waste your time and money,"This was the worst portrayal of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's characters that I have ever seen. The plot made no sense whatsoever.

The only similarity to Doyle's original characters is their names. Holmes was not a brawler. He was an extremely intelligent character who only used cocaine when bored.

Not your father's Holmes & Watson,"Guy Ritchie's re-imagining of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's legendary detective Sherlock Holmes takes the original character and updates him for modern audiences. The setting is the same (Victorian England) but Holmes is now as adept with his fists as he is with his powers of deduction.In this film, Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) and his stalwart companion, Dr. Watson (Jude Law), become embroiled in a mystery which seems to suggest authentic diabolism. A recently executed Lord has risen from the grave (or so it would seem) and Scotland Yard is baffled. We follow Holmes & Watson as they work their way through London in search of clues that will reveal the solution to this mystery.As mentioned, Robert Downey Jr. & Jude Law play the title character and the good doctor, respectively. They play the characters well while also introducing a physicality that isn't present in other interpretations of the roles. Rachel McAdams plays the requisite romantic interest and I'm pretty apathetic to her presence here. Mark Strong makes a fine villain, though, and the rest of the cast seems pretty well chosen.Guy Ritchie might not have been the best choice to direct this film but I guess that the producers were looking for something different. He basically directs it like he would any of his modern crime flicks, though he's got a bigger budget to work with this time around. The results are certainly passable for a blockbuster with the focus on action but I still would have preferred another approach. As for the soundtrack, I don't think that it bears comparison with Ritchie's other films, which typically excel in that department. God only knows why ""The Rocky Road to Dublin"" pops up a few times.For what it is, ""Sherlock Holmes"" is a enjoyable ride even if it isn't necessarily an award-worthy film. That being said, I was intrigued enough that I would watch the inevitable sequel when it arrives, so I guess that the film served its purpose.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

One for the doctor . One for the rope!,"""One for the doctor . One for the rope!""One thing that is undeniable is that Sherlock Holmes is definitely a Guy Ritchie film . It has all the hallmarks of his movies . The humour , the dialogue and the slow motion action scenes and those characteristics are what I liked about the movie but it's far from perfect...Detective Sherlock Holmes and his stalwart partner Watson engage in a battle of wits and brawn with a nemesis whose plot is a threat to all of England.Despite liking Guy Ritchie and the way he makes movies , there is definitely something lacking in this film and that's a plot that can hold the film together for over two hours .
The storyline is baggy at best and while it's fun throughout I was hoping for more of a traditional Sherlock storyline and one I could get my teeth into .It's a shame that Ritchie had to cast an American in a role of someone that couldn't be more English but Robert Downey Jr does a pretty good job. Jude Law is good , but underused and Mark Strong plays the bad guy yet again . It's what he does best but the roles he picks are becoming all too predictable.Looking at the way this is written it's seems that Sherlock the TV series has used most of the ideas from the film and that's a compliment I suppose and although I enjoyed the film I found it had far too much style and very little substance.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Entertaining,"This was a very entertaining movie. Being a Sherlock Holmes fan, I have read all the original books. This is the closest depiction of the original character I have seen. It is however, more exaggerated towards action. All the other movies and depictions have zero physical prowess for Holmes. In the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle books, Holmes is portrayed as an expert boxer, fencer and an expert with the singlestick or cudgel. He was also portrayed as a physically strong person in the original books.I also liked how the movie was current with the technology of the day. The first voice transmission using radio waves was in 1900 and 1901 by 2 different independent people. I would expect that in the late 1800's of the movie, a binary on/off use of radio waves would be a first step.This character is also shown as more disheveled with his apartment and his person. This is also more in tune with the original books.I do like the old Basil Rathbone movies made in the 40's as well as most of the other portrayals (Benedict Cumberbatch series). However, they do not fully portray the full breadth of the character in the original books. Unfortunately, the pseudo intellectuals, who have obviously never read the original books, use the old movies and current shows as the guide line. They give this move a ""1"" because it is ""Not like the original character"" or the tech is beyond tech of the day. In reality they wanted ""Jane Austin"" or colorized version of the old Basil Rathbone movies. What they got Sir Arthur Conan Doyle on steroids.If you are looking for a more action version closer to the original books (although exaggerated) this movie is for you.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
A Guy Ritchie version (+70) - Movie review,"This review is strictly my point of view and many may not agree with me, I being a Guy Ritchie fan, I do admire most of the things he brings on screen, so keep that in your mind before my recommendation.This version of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's characters, where the bromance of Doctor and Holmes continues with a stylish narration of Guy Ritchie. Guy Ritchie's narrative style is not for everyone, it contains a bit more of action and fantasy substances that will not be accepted openly by everyone.People may feel that the action sequences are opposite of what the authentic characters possess, but what I felt is in this version Guy Ritchie tried to create the action sequences in such a way that it was mentally calculated and not just physical capacity of Sherlock Holmes.The editing, camera, and the technical team of Guy Ritchie done a much-appreciated job that you will cherish the visuals, and a very supportive music by Hans Zimmer makes the experience much better.And of course, you will enjoy Robert Downey Jr.'s charisma and also the chemistry between himself and Jude Law.I rate this a 70%.WATCH IT for a stylish version of Sherlock Holmes, especially if you like Guy Ritchie narration.

Not so great,"One of the non-significant Guy Ritchie's movies. You'll have to do better than that.Very far from Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, far from Snatch. Better than Revolver, which means it's not a complete failure.Plot? Not bad. Humor? Below average of his movies. Characters? Jude Law and Robert Downey Jr. are very good. I am glad the director finally decided to be more creative than just spending a life being a husband to a trophy wife (what a waste of talent; no offense, Madonna, you never had any talent, just overblown gender-related impulsiveness).In my opinion this movie will never be THE Sherlock Holmes movie, like Peter Jackson's adaptation of Lord of the Rings captivated fans of the books.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

Is this film a case that's worth solving? Check out my review below to find out!,"""Sherlock Holmes"" (2009), there are many books out there depicting private detectives in the world of literature. But, out of all of them, Sherlock Holmes is my all-time favorite. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is a brilliant author! So, as you can probably imagine, I was very interested in seeing the different movie and TV show adaptations of Sherlock Holmes. Most of the screen adaptations were just hit and miss for me. Then, came the 2009 film, ""Sherlock Holmes"". I wasn't expecting a whole lot out of it, therefore, I went in with very low expectations. Sometimes, that can be a good thing and sometimes it can be a bad thing. In the case of this movie, it was a great thing! In my personal opinion, this is the greatest film adaptation of Sherlock Holmes. It has a perfect story, perfect acting, beautiful sets/locations, perfect special effects, and also a perfect soundtrack to tie it all together. The storyline is, Sherlock Holmes and his partner Doctor Watson are assigned by a secret society to stop a mysticist's plot to seize control of Britain by the use of seemingly supernatural means. At first glance, a plot like this sounds very exciting. I thought to myself: ""as long as there are talented writers and great direction, this could very easily be pulled off!"" Sure enough, when I went to go see it, I was hooked right from the start. It had me intrigued, invested and excited all the way from beginning to end! The storyline is perfect for a movie like this, it's simple, with just the right amount of complexities needed for a great mystery story. As I said before, simple plots should be reserved for mostly action or comedy films. However, for mysteries or drama films, storylines need to be complex. With complexities, it keeps the audience guessing what's going to happen next, which is crucial for a mystery movie like this. If the story is too simple, then how could it be a mystery? We, as the viewer, would be able to see what was coming up next and the plot would be ruined. However, ""Sherlock Holmes"" is the perfect balance of simple and complex. As I watched it for the first time, I had sort of an idea of what was about to occur. But, I was hit with many surprises along the way and the climax was one I did not see coming. Another reason why this movie adaptation works, is because it's more of a true depiction of Sherlock Holmes himself. For those who may not know, before Sherlock Holmes became a member of high society, he started out as kind of a bum. Then eventually, Doctor Watson showed him the error of his ways and also helped to improve his behavior. Plus, Holmes did have training to learn how to fight. All of the fight scenes are cleverly done and just add another layer of excitement. I won't go into anymore details, because I don't want to spoil the film. But, let me assure you, it's a story that you will remember for the rest of your life. As for the acting, it's just as fantastic as the plot. The cast is absolutely insane! You have: Robert Downey Jr., Jude Law, Rachel McAdams, Mark Strong and even more. At first, I was kind of skeptical of Robert Downey Jr. Playing Sherlock Holmes, same thing with Rachel McAdams playing Irene. As a lot of you already know, I have a pet peeve about actors or actresses playing foreign roles different from their own nationality. However, if they are able to nail the accent(s), I can easily overlook it. In the case of this film, Robert Downey Jr. Is an American playing an English man and Rachel McAdams is a Canadian playing an English woman. Both of them absolutely nail the English accent in this movie. Props to the dialect coach! When I first saw that Robert was going to play Sherlock Holmes, it surprised me. But, he played the role to perfection and it shows his ability as an actor outside the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man. The rest of the cast does a great job as well! As for the sets/locations, they are perfect and give this movie a beautiful atmosphere. You can't go wrong with England, or anywhere else in Europe! All of the special effects are first-rate. Which is no surprise, seeing that this film was made in 2009! Finally, the soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer is phenomenal and his film score sets the perfect tone for the movie. Hans Zimmer is one of my top ten favorite film score composer, and the one in this film does not disappoint! ""Sherlock Holmes"" is a fantastic film and such a great depiction of the literary character. I could watch it over and over again and never get tired of it. I'm giving this film 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you're a fan of Sherlock Holmes and you haven't seen this movie, go and see it today. Or else, Lord Blackwood may cast a spell on you!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Sherlock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels","First of all, let me say this was a very watchable and entertaining movie, full of action and enough noise to keep even the most sleep-deprived insomniac wide awake. I enjoyed it and would even like to see it again, this time with earplugs, in order to catch some of the nuances I no doubt missed in the first viewing.That said, this movie, like most movies these days made from literary works, has little to do with the original story other than lifting the characters' names -- without adopting their original personalities or characteristics. Ritchie's Holmes, alas not surprisingly, has more of a ""Snatch"" hoodlum in him than anything Conan Doyle wrote. Although it's true that the literary Holmes was no cupcake, and dabbled in ""fisticuffs,"" this Holmes looked more like Jason Statham than the intellectual and quirky sleuth of Baker Street. The fight scenes (and there were many) were long, drawn-out (although full of action), and unbelievable.I found myself wishing for these over-the-top action scenes to be over so Holmes could make some clever deductions from obscure clues. I was sadly disappointed that there was very little of the latter in this film. This is a Holmes on steroids (and not the occasional cocaine that the true literary Holmes was known to have sampled). It was the Holmes of ""Snatch"" or ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels,"" not the genius detective as played best by Jeremy Brett in the British Sherlock Holmes series.In short, although this is a competent action film, full of explosions and clever fight scenes, it is NOT worthy to be attached to the name of the great Sherlock Holmes character. As long as you know that going in, and you don't care, then you will thoroughly enjoy this film. Sherlock Holmes purists -- get ready to hate!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
A brilliant reboot.,"Sherlock Holmes, the latest offering from Guy Richie is a pretty decent movie if I'm honest. Not at all what I expected. For the most part you don't even feel like you're watching a movie. For instance, part of the opening titles are superimposed onto cobblestones and the other part is written in a newspaper-like form. It's a pretty refreshing change.It's pretty clear from the outset that Downey Jr. nails Holmes' accent and speech patterns. Not once do you believe the actor playing Holmes' actually has an American accent, and the same can be said for Jude Law as Watson.Although I don't usually comment on the soundtrack of films, I do feel I should mention the soundtrack in Sherlock Holmes. Hans Zimmer's 'Discombobulate' is used at various points in the movie, most notably in the opening credits and it helps greatly in setting the scene. It's hard to imagine a better fitting score for this movie.Although this is going to sound pretty cliché, Jude Law is on fine form here, his portrayal of Dr. Watson as both a friend of Holmes and as a professional is literally flawless, the chemistry between Downey Jr. and Law works extremely well. Mark Strong is brilliant as the movie's villain Lord Blackwood, he seems to play bad guys pretty well, he's all you could want from the 'dark side': mysterious, cunning and quite creepy. A notable highlight here for me was Rachel McAdams' portrayal of Irene Adler, a criminal and past love-interest of Holmes'. McAdams has certainly come a long way since her Mean Girls days and really shows exactly what she can do with her acting skills here.Acting talent aside, I was pleasantly surprised when I went to my local cinema to see Sherlock Holmes. The martial arts aspect was new to me. I've never pictured Sherlock Holmes as a martial artist, but it did bring a decent helping of action to the table. There's a pretty decent helping of humour here too; the movie works surprisingly well with a small helping of comedy thrown in here and there, although there's not enough there for big laughs, it brings a certain charm to the scene.I won't ruin any of the story in this review as I'm aware my past two reviews were a little too revealing in terms of plot details and spoilers. All I can say is if you haven't already, I would strongly recommend going to see Sherlock Holmes. There really is something there for anyone.http://ukmore.tk/",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Slapstick Sherlock,"Put in a British setting with some British accents, but lacks any kind of British film characteristics. RDJ's accent is passable and nothing can be held against his performance, but in a fast-paced story where everything is figured out very rapidly, you really need to e-nun-ci-ate.The film redeems itself with a typically Sherlock reveal of all past mysteries, but up until that point you just have to accept that whatever is happening is happening and that someone knows how to explain it all. Tons of Hollywood action making it the furthest thing from the Sherlock TV series. That's not a bad thing, but it just means that if you liked the series you are not dead set to enjoy this, nor if you were a fan of the books either.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Entertaining!,"The first time I saw this in theatres, I thought that this was a bore. I could hardly be comfortable watching this film. The second time I saw this was recently on DVD. Now that I had subtitles, I was able to be entertained. The reason I was bored the first time cause I had no idea what Robert Downey Jr. was saying. I needed subtitles for that.This is based of the classic books by Arthur Conan Doyle. This is about how Sherlock and his partner Watson go after the mysterious Lord Blackwood and they want to get to him before he destroys London.The acting is pretty good. Other than the problem I had with Downey, I loved the acting. Jude Law is great as Watson. As always Mark Strong plays a great villain.The production sets, sound, and music were great. I really thought well of the visuals.Overall, this is a solid movie. I expect the sequel to be more of the same. I rate this film 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Insipid and boring,"Maybe I'm getting old, but maybe this movie is just stupid.Most of the time various people just run around like headless chicken.

I could forgive over the top acting, I could forgive over the top everything else, but I can't forgive that they forgot to conceive a plot for this.It's one of those movies that you struggle to remember whether you've seen it or you've just seen the trailer and someone warned you not to waste time with it.

For people who forgot how to read,"While casting good actors, this is a murder of Conan Doyle's original creation made to work for the modern generation of ""the stupid"". While cinematicly interesting and attractive for the people who have never read a book a day, or even a book a month, as most Ritchie's films are (I love Lock Stock too), this take on the classic is a step too far.Jude Law is great as Watson, i never doubted that character in his hands (similar to Russian Solomin who played Watson brilliantly, with a healthy dose of humour too), Robert Downey is the usual American take on a superhero, despite of Ritchie's UK heritage, he comes across very far from the character Doyle created. I like Robert Downey too, normally, as an actor, but he';s gone quite a few notches down in my popularity list after making this but not to discredit him too much, Ritchie's whole idea to modernise Holmes stories for the new ""internet generation"" or illiterat6e people who have never held a book in their hands is rather shallow and pathetic (or pedantic as peter Griffin would say), especially for those who love Conan Doyle's books, as most of US remakes of classics are. I am sure i will be disagreed with, especially by those who have not read those books until the pages worn off....When you grow up as a kid, reading every Sherlock Holmes story 30-50 times, because they are brilliant (and the main reason for myself to immigrate to UK 16 years ago from Ukraine), you begin to realise how bad the modern films (based on classic books) are, making them ""interesting"" and ""exciting"" for the new generations, but he might as well have made it in the 80's, with Arnie and Sly, as the main characters and are packed with cool special effects, destroying the original stories. I could moan about it for ages, but i guess if i were an 18 year old boy who has never read a true classic book (or a book of any kind) about Holmes, i would have rated it a lot higher, 6-7/10 perhaps, but luckily I know it came nowhere near portraying true great stories and characters, so it was a huge disappointment to me. I wonder what my dear Stephen Fry (big fan of Holmes/Doyle) would think of this atrocityI have only 1 review published, out of 4 I wrote for IMDb, so this probably won't see the light of day anyway, but for all those with a bit of brain in them, avoid this, if you have any respect for the original great books/charactersTo be absolutely objective though (hence 2/10, instead of 1/10), the visuals, the action movie setup, Guy Ritchie's usual fun bits and the cast, it's OK :), but the stories were raped and completely re-interpreted to get a hit at box office. awful, simply awful, made me completely rethink my liking of Guy's movies",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

Better than the trailers by FAR,"Just rented the movie from the Redbox, and I have to say it was far better than the trailers or clips shown on TV commercials. I was expecting a mindless romp with the Holmes name carrying it, but actually found a clever story and interesting characters.The only negatives I would really point out is that there was a lot of action i would still not expect Holmes and Watson to be involved in, and I thought there was a lack of ""chemistry"" between Jude Law and Robert Downey Jr..

Nothing Escapes Him,"In a dynamic new portrayal of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's most famous characters, SHERLOCK HOLMES sends Holmes and his stalwart partner Watson on their latest challenge. Revealing fighting skills as lethal as his legendary intellect, Holmes will battle as never before to bring down a new nemesis and unravel a deadly plot that could destroy the country.It embarrasses me to say that I have not read the original series of novels of Sherlock Holmes nor have I seen the most well known TV shows or movies. However, I did see a cartoon series on Holmes when I was a little kid, so I know the basic gist of the characters of Holmes and Watson.This adaptation of one of the most well known characters in human history is quite good, I must say. Director Guy Ritchie reinvents Holmes as a more masculine character who knows how to do martial arts. While this may bother the die hard fans out there, I think it's quite fresh and appropriate to our 21st Century society. On top of that, it's obvious Warner Bros. was trying to appeal to the teenage audience as well as the fans. But overall, I think Ritchie's style gives the film a more hip and eccentric vibe.However, what makes this movie successful at what it does is the actors. Robert Downey's Holmes is quite fantastic. The fact that Holmes pays attention to every detail and calculates almost every action that occurs and, at times, without the audiences even knowing it, is what made me love this character. It also helps that Robert Downey and Jude Law have great chemistry. They play off their dialogue so well that I just have to smile. Jude Law is the perfect sidekick. Rachel McAdams and Mark Strong are also great, although the latter is sorely underused.The visual style of the film is very pretty to look at. From the visual effects to the production design to the wardrobe to the attention of certain colors used in scenes, SHERLOCK HOLMES arguably succeeds in every category. Han Zimmer's soundtrack is also very unique, the main theme diverting from your usual orchestral playing.Maybe the one problem about the film is the script and plot. It needs a bit of work because the more you think about the story, the more plot inconsistencies you find. However, as a mindless fun film, it succeeds in doing just that. It's entertaining from beginning to end mainly because of the strong cast and director Guy Ritchie. Sure, it's not the greatest film of all time but it sure is wildly entertaining for what it is.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
The Life of Bohemian Genius,"Combining Guy Richie with Robert Downey Jr. (Sherlock Holmes) and Jude Law (Dr Watson) in Sherlock Holmes movie sounded like mixing George Lukacs with Meryl Streep and Anthony Hopkins in Jane Austen story. But surprisingly the style, story and actors fit perfectly to depict this the end of 19th century mystery.The movie concentrated a lot on Holmes' antisocial behaviour and eccentric habits, and on his troublesome relationship with Scotland Yard, perhaps more than was done in books. But then again the most of the books were narrated by Watson, the movie follows mostly Holmes. His regular cocaine use was replaced by experimenting drugs on his dog, bringing some humorous relaxation into otherwise intense story. No doubt the friends of canine are not happy about this twist. The genius part, how the deduction process in Holmes' head works, was achieved by a flash forward scenes narrated by Holmes, or similar kind of flashback scenes. The story it self is following now so trendy symbolism/supernatural/undead theme.Jude Law was superb as Watson, having precisely a right amount of edginess, physical activeness, and frustration and loyalty toward Holmes. Robert Downey Jr played drug induced Holmes, well perhaps naturally. Character of Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams), The Woman for Holmes, even though acted well, felt like unnecessary stuffing for the story. But filmmakers just has to dumb some sexual/romantic whatever it is into movies even though it serves know one. Taken the amount of writers in this movie, it was surprise that storyline worked at all.Overall, a very refreshing adaptation of old story.It would not be surprise if sequel shows up in a year or two.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
The new Sherlock Holmes,"Entertaining movie. Action, mystery and humor. Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law are great to watch as Holmes and Watson, and the interacting with the female characters give a extra dimension which was often lacking in the ""normal"" Holmes-movies. If you have been a Sherlock Holmes fan and seen other Sherlock Holmes-movies, the characters are far more active. Sometimes the explanation of the ""puzzle and mysteries"" are complex, but reflect the style and character of Holmes. Interesting is the way in which Guy Ritchie shows the mental capabilities of Holmes, and gives you a look inside Holmes his head. Great twist and turns in script and in style of cinematographic. Looking forward to another ""sequel"" of Holmes and Watson movies the new style.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Do you feel fortuitous, tramp?","Sherlock Holmes the action hero is here. This is a film made for people who have not had any but the most fleeting contact with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic hero. Unfortunately, everything that makes Doyle's Sherlock interesting (his dedication to cold logic, self-destructive nature and absolute need for puzzles to solve in order to keep his dark side busy) is all but gone, mostly replaced with less disturbing traits. Instead of an intellectual character who defeats his enemies with his mind, the Sherlock in this film is more likely to employ his fists and weapons. Just being smart simply isn't sexy, so Holmes gets to be a Victorian Dirty Harry instead.If you have only a vague idea of who Sherlock Holmes is then you'll probably love this film. Production value is high, the acting mostly good, the rendering of London wonderful. Anyone who ever read one of Doyle's books, however, should stay well away.Of course we have Sherlock Holmes 2 to look forward to as well.

Elementary Good Fun,"Guy Ritchie brings a fresh look to the legendary sleuth and introduces a new generation of viewers to ""Sherlock Holmes."" Based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's original stories, not the cliché Basil Rathbone film series of last century, this ""Holmes"" is gritty, eccentric, difficult, and compelling.Who better then to cast in the title role than Robert Downey Jr? RDJ has been a favorite of mine since ""Chaplin,"" so it is indeed a treat to see him in leading roles (Holmes, & ""Iron Man""'s Tony Stark). Quick, smarmy, clever, or brooding, it's hard to take your eyes off RDJ on screen -- nothing he does goes to waste.Similarly, nothing in the ""Holmes"" screenplay goes to waste -- every tiny action and bit of dialog ties together, beginning with the opening sequence. Much like Doyle's stories, there are hints and clues strewn throughout the film, making Holmes' deductions feasible and the story's conclusion logical and satisfying. Of course, Holmes' nemesis Professor Moriarty is introduced, and viewers know that we haven't seen the last of him.Jude Law is a tense and frequently irritated Watson, not a hint of Nigel Bruce's bumbling but lovable counterpart to Rathbone's Holmes. The balance of the cast give similarly engaging performances, most notably Rachel McAdams as the mysterious Irene Adler, and Mark Strong as the nefarious Lord Blackwood.Ritchie's direction is also one of the stars in this film. As he did in ""Snatch,"" Ritchie plays with the viewer's perception of time and the sequence of events. This keeps the pace fast and furious, but the careful observer will note seemingly random events throughout the story, and be able to weave them together at the end. All this is done without giving too much away. This is a pleasing experience for the film-goer, who ultimately feels that he or she has been in the know from the beginning.An intelligent action/adventure romp, ""Sherlock Holmes"" left us hungry for a sequel.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Superb action mystery,"From the opening shot of a camera rushing up behind a cart on the streets of London Guy Ritchie's signature kinetic style is on full display, and it is the fact that this energy is matched head on by Robert Downey Jr's exuberant turn as the titular hero that in large part makes this such an enjoyable film. This is a film where you cannot point at any singular part of the whole as the strongest part as it is impossible to imagine any without the other. The energy and wit of the script match the performances and the direction. It seems to be one of those movies where everything just fell into place.For me some of the most enjoyable moments of the film were just watching Jude Law and Robert Downey Jr's banter as they go back and forth, they inhabit their characters in a way rarely found in larger Hollywood productions nowadays. Some of the awkward moments that occur between the two as they traverse their complicated and realistic relationship with each other are priceless. This isn't a deep movie by any means but it does touch on some interesting themes of friendship and the choices we have to make as we move forward in life.A word must be said about the fight scenes. While they won't be winning any awards for kung fu choreography the melee is universally impressive and believable, except where it's turned on it's head for comic value. This ability of the film to jump back and forth effectively from violent comical romp to period mystery and back almost seamlessly illustrates Guy Ritchie's assured hand behind the camera, never veering too far into gravitas, and at the same time wholly avoiding camp. They are never making fun of the material, they are having fun with the material.As far as I could tell the production design was flawless, every scene seemed as big or as small as it needed to be, and there are a couple of impressive set pieces thrown in there too. This movies budget came in at about $90 million and you can surely see it in the scenes where the set is literally being ripped apart. All in all Sherlock Holmes has a strong script, good acting (superb from Robert and Jude), great casting, and confident, imaginative direction from a director who seems to have found a project that plays to all of his strengths and none of his weaknesses.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"An excellent, entertaining rendering of Sherlock Holmes","This is one of my favorite movies to date; watching it again made me remember exactly how much I loved it and inspired me to write a review (well, recommendation, really).Pros:The plot held up, keeping you guessing, but when the solution was revealed it didn't come completely out of the blue. There were clues, and re-watching lets you see exactly how the pieces came together in Holmes's head. Some people enjoy picking apart solid plots and declaring them imperfect and implausible, but this one really doesn't deserve that. Is there a movie plot in existence that *can't* be picked apart if someone tries hard enough?The cinematography was superb. Every set, every sweeping shot of grimy, rainy, nineteenth century London, pulled you into the same time and place as the legendary Sherlock Holmes and his companion, Dr. Watson. The coloring was very dark and murky - blues, grays, and browns - and it fit perfectly.Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law were fantastic in their respective roles; stellar performances from both of them, and their chemistry was great. They truly brought to life the strange friendship of Holmes and Watson: two entirely different individuals, yet ultimately dependent on one another.It was witty. Sarcasm and dark humor joined with action (not necessarily fight scenes, but unceasing *activity*) to keep up the pace of the film, making it smart, entertaining, and funny (I actually laughed aloud a few times).I loooooved the soundtrack. I'm a fan of Hans Zimmer, and he didn't disappoint this time around. It's very string-heavy (maybe that's why I like it? I play the violin) and sets the tone for the film nicely. Writing this, I have a part of it stuck in my head again.Con:Sometimes it was hard to distinguish exactly what was being said. The dialogue is very fast paced, and a combination of the accents and that mumbling thing that actors do way too often made it kind of hard to catch every line in the theater. If you're watching it at home (it's not in theaters anymore, so I guess you would be watching it at home), make sure you raise the volume, rewind, etc. because basically everything is worth hearing.I definitely, definitely recommend this. Sure, ""purists"" will complain that it doesn't exactly fit the timeline that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle created (concerning Mary and Irene), but with so much material to draw from and condense into a movie, can you really blame them for reinventing it a bit? I think they did a stellar job of taking two well-known characters, fully fleshing them out, and placing them in an entirely new adventure. ""Sherlock Holmes"" only adds to the canon; it doesn't detract from it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Possibly the most faithful adaption so far!,"Having read most (even if not all) of the original stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and having winced through the years at all the different adaptations of the stories into a visual medium I was very sceptic at first, when I heard and read about this movie. But since I'm a big fan of the original Sherlock Holmes I thought I'd give them at least one chance. And they surely deserved it. This movie is possibly the most faithful adaptation of Doyle's writing to film so far. Ironically the things that most people will go ""Hey, that's not how Doyle wrote it!"" is actually just as he wrote them. They've chosen to show sides of Holmes that have been ignored before. Doyle wrote Mr Holmes as an eccentric, drug abusing, violin playing, unpleasant fighter, and they've chosen to let him be that man. Another thing I was pleasantly surprised at was how, untypical of modern day movie-making, they did Dr Watson justice. Instead of, as so many earlier versions have, portray him as a stumbling, daft fool and comical sidekick (if it's not Watson who is incorrectly used as a comical sidekick it's Gimli or Ron Weasley) he is allowed to be smart and driven by curiosity and lust for adventure.Finally they also manage to capture the dirty, early twentieth century London well. Costumes are well done, apart from the cleavage on the ladies which is a bit too modern, and Zimmer's music mixed with the occasional old folksong works fine too.I warmly recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, and to everyone else too of course. I will myself return to the theatre to watch it again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

Sherlock Holmes,"The famous detective, Sherlock Holmes, is best known by all for his genius, logical thinking that he uses to solve many of the cases from the short stories penned by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. There have been plenty of movies and series created to display the eccentric, yet brilliant mind through the years, but Guy Ritchie, well-known director for movies like Snatch (2000) and RocknRolla (2007), decided to bring it to the ""big screen"" in 2009. While Ritchie's past credits are more gritty and harsh with charming, yet crooked mobster personalities, he delivers us with a time-honored film from the detective point-of-view. He brings action-packed scenes and even comedic wryness to this new thrilling adaptation of the famous mysteries which significantly changes the original theme of the detective from Mystery to Action/Adventure.The movie is cast with veteran actor Robert Downey, Jr., who plays Sherlock Holmes and is joined by his trusty colleague, Dr. John Watson (Jude Law) for yet another mystery involving a series of murders. Holmes and Watson's relationship is put to the test as Watson faces life changes that Holmes must inevitably face. Lord Blackwood, an oculist played by Mark Strong, is an unusual foe for Holmes because this plot holds more than the average thief or accidental murder of a jealous mistress. The question is ""Can Sherlock Holmes solve a supernatural mystery that is lies beyond his scientific logic?"" A fresh new face to the film is Irene Adler played by Rachel McAdams, a master thief who seems to be the only one that Holmes cannot figure out, yet carries for her an everlasting yen. Irene mysteriously returns to Holmes for hire and finds herself twisted into the case and in evident danger.In recent years, Robert Downey, Jr. has been successful in integrating his career into block-buster Action/Adventure theme hits like Tropic Thunder and Iron Man, but with the intellectual plot of Sherlock Holmes, he seems to flawlessly capture the eccentricity and truthfulness of the original detective. The fight scenes and explosions seem minimal to his acting, yet Ritchie accomplished an excellent feat of taking the original somber character and turning him into an animated, dare-devil of a detective. It is a thrilling ride that leaves the viewer unaware of the next clue or lead into the case, but maintains itself high on the entertainment factor. This type of movie and theme relates to the typical action-movies that have feuding partners dealing with each other's issues while going after the bad guys. For example, there are movies like Rush Hour, Bad Boys 1 & 2, and classics like 48 Hours and Lethal Weapon. These movies involve high-tech explosion effects, fleeting chase scenes, and brutal exchanges of punches.In summary, Sherlock Holmes (2009) is a twist on typical Action/Adventure movies. It contains brawls and explosions, a vicious villain, and at some point-a beautiful woman in distress like many other action-movies. Although, this story contains much depth and detail that allows the viewer to enter the intrinsic mind of a brilliant, yet unstable detective while he attempts to solve this extraordinary case.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Absolutely brilliant!,"I found it strange when I read reviews that people were labeling Guy Ritchie's new film as a travesty of sorts to the canon of Sherlock Holmes. Not only did I find the film delightfully refreshing, it is easily one of the best thrillers of the year. It plays like a classic mystery worthy of Sherlock Holmes and injects enough kinetic action into it without sacrificing the integrity of the Holmes canon. In fact I would argue that not only does it not sacrifice the integrity, it ENHANCES it.The vision of Sherlock Holmes with the deerstalker cap and the clogs and the meticulous tidy demeanor is one concocted purely in some fictional alternate universe where Sir Arthur Conan Doyle apparently never existed. The Sherlock Holmes from the book was a fast-living, eccentric, drug-abusing, fairly obnoxious character whose intelligence was not only a gift, but a curse; it managed to alienate everyone he had ever known, save for a few friends in the police force who admired him and his dearest friend, Dr. Watson (played by Jude Law). Not only is he a more energetic Holmes, he's a much more accurate and faithful one too. We get to see more of his physical side (in conjunction with a considerable amount of his mental side, in fact; I can't begin to count the number of times in the film we see Holmes use logical deduction and quick thinking to piece together facts, even at the eleventh hour). This is, again, in keeping with his character from the stories - he does know martial arts and he is a master of disguise.The story itself is immensely entertaining too. The film starts out with him supposedly closing a case involving a Satanic serial killer, who turns out to be a nobleman in the House of Lords, namely, Lord Blackwood (who is yet another cameo character). Blackwood is tried and hanged soon thereafter, and old flame Irene Adler (ANOTHER cameo character - see, how can the Holmes enthusiasts NOT love this film?) comes to him with a case. There is a subplot about her working with another person, which I won't reveal as it's a fantastic revelation near the end of the film, but Holmes quickly discovers that her case is connected to Blackwood's - who apparently is no longer dead and has risen from the grave. The film is largely spent trying to figure out Blackwood's endgame, making logical leaps throughout and culminating in an intensely exciting climax.Dr. Watson is a heavily improved character from the bumbling comic relief he served in the television series - in fact, he is more accurately depicted (though without the limp), as a veteran of the Afghan wars, and a stout, powerful man with some martial arts capabilities of his own. Most importantly, his relationship with Holmes as his closest friend, more than a brother, is given high importance and much more respectful treatment. Holmes is devastated to learn that Watson is not only getting engaged and married, but that he's going to move out of 221B Baker Street. The two prove to be nearly inseparable companions, although of course his irritation with Holmes does occasionally reach a boiling point (as it should).Anyone - including those new to Holmes and Holmes fans/enthusiasts - is going to love this movie. It takes a ton of talent to produce a movie like this and I can't wait for a sequel.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
A detective story in blockbuster format,"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle once famously killed off Sherlock Holmes, only to revive him when the public reacted unfavorably. If he were alive today, he'd probably come to the conclusion that he made the right choice, since the medium of film has truly made sure the great detective will never die: from Basil Rathbone to Billy Wilder via Disney's The Great Mouse Detective to TV's Dr. Gregory House, there's a version of Holmes for all ages and tastes. And now he gets the Hollywood treatment again, albeit with a British director, one Guy Ritchie.Rather than adapting a specific story, the film goes in its own direction: Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) has just solved a series of grisly murders, but is unhappy because his loyal assistant Dr. Watson (Jude Law) is moving out of their apartment on Baker Street to live with his fiancée Mary Morstan (Kelly Reilly). Soon enough, though, he has more important things to worry about: his former adversary/lover Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) is back in London, and a new chain of macabre events, linked to the alleged resurrection of criminal mastermind Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong), requires his full attention, especially as the fact seem to go against his belief that everything has a rational explanation.The announcement that Ritchie, the man behind Snatch and RocknRolla, was going to direct Sherlock Holmes was met with some preoccupation due to his fast-paced, ""hip"" style which many see as the polar opposite of the traditional Holmes story. Additionally, the fact that five writers worked on the script caused some extra anxiety. As it turns out, there was no need to worry on either front: the screenplay has enough smarts and wit to satisfy Conan Doyle purists, while Ritchie's ""action"" take on the character, which is vaguely rooted in the books (Holmes has been described as a decent amateur boxer), never distracts too much from the mystery, the humor - Holmes' occasional mockery of the police makes for some hilarious conversations with Eddie Marsan's Inspector Lestrade - or the flawless reconstruction of Victorian England (although he could have avoided the use of slow-motion in the fight scenes).Cast-wise, the two leads are perfect: Downey, no stranger to quirky roles, nails the detective's accent, sarcasm and brilliance with relish (the script also allows for a subtle reference to Holmes' cocaine addiction), while Law counterbalances it with a more serious but charismatic Watson, getting as far away as possible from the chubby buffoon seen in previous incarnations. Strong, always among the best things in any movie where he appears, is an enjoyably sinister antagonist, and McAdams is funny and alluring in equal measure, despite the lack of depth granted to her part (the same goes for Reilly, the other woman in what is otherwise pretty much a ""bloke's movie"").All in all, this new, ""youthful"" version of Sherlock Holmes gets most of the vital things right: it is a blockbuster at heart, but still packs enough charm and potential to make sure the practically inevitable sequel - whose focus on Professor Moriarty is hinted at numerous times during the film - will be the kind of superior big-screen treatment Holmes craves and deserves.

"Rather clever, moderately dark and cinematic and has good acting","Jude Law and Robert Downey Jr thrill in this excellent action film set in Victorian times, it's more exciting than the older Sherlock Holmes films with Basil Rathbone and Peter Cushing but it does lose a bit of its story with its heavier emphasise on fight scenes and stunts.It's definitely worth a watch by Sherlock fans and young people just getting into the many films and adaptions, the sets are great and the overall plot is good, better than the sequel. Perhaps there's not as much detective work as other films but it has an undeniably uniqueness to it and a modern feel. Robert Downey plays a good Sherlock and sticks relatively well to the book's vision, Jude Law plays less a bumbling sidekick and more an equal to Holmes in fighting ability, and only a bit below him in wit.8/10: Atmospheric, action-packed, and generally just a good film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"Well-acted, Authentic settings","Sherlock is made more human in this one and not simply the dispassionate thinking machine portrayed by others while Dr.Watson gets very physical, in brawls and street chases.Downey is good as Holmes, showing his selfish, somewhat petulant side--at Watson's coming marriage--as well as the usual brilliant observations about those around him. He rushes in where the police fear to tread and his casual insults to Lestrade are done in such a way the bumbling Scotland Yard man doesn't even seem to notice, pointing out his ineptitude. Irene Adler's place in Holmes' life is really built up in this one, though the real story between the two seems to have been more his admiration of her intellect and the fact she was one of the few people ever to best him, than a physical one. Nevertheless, it's fun, with a great villain and a secret society determined to bring down the government.Placing the story in its actual time period makes this one of the better Sherlock Holmes adaptations. There are great panoramic vistas of Victorian London, so vast they have to be partially paintings.Throw in a touch of the supernatural, some great effects, a dash of humor, a couple of explosions, and what's not to like?",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

His Holmes is deeply flawed-riddled with bouts of self-destructive behaviour and an over-reliance on Watson-but also endearing. The chemistry between Downey Jr. And Jude Law is undeniable. Law's Watson is a steadying force, a pragmatic partner to Holmes' mad genius.

Doyle would be proud,"As a movie, Sherlock Holmes is solid; there is action, humor, and excitement to be found. I won't even dwell on that sort of thing, because I'm not qualified. I'll leave that to the movie experts.But I absolutely must comment on how well this movie captured the essence of A.C. Doyle's masterpiece. I believe that this movie, this plot, is very close to what Doyle might have done if he had tried to create a similar sequel to Hound of the Baskervilles. This movie has all the appearance of a supernatural incident until we get Holmes's unveiling and everything is explained in perfectly ordinary terms. Just like Hound of the Baskervilles.There were a couple of disappointments I had. I don't think Watson was done very well at all; I've read most of the Sherlock Holmes canon, and cannot recall Watson ever being reluctant to work with Holmes. Whereas in the movie he is so reluctant that Holmes uses his talents to 'trick' Watson into following him. I am also severely annoyed by Adler's portrayal; perhaps it was inevitable that she would be portrayed as a love interest, but I find Doyle's version of her far more compelling. In the canon, she is a fascination, and the fact that Holmes has no romantic interest in her adds to the enigma of his character. In the movie, she is his human weakness, which is infinitely more cliché.But these complaints are basically petty. After all, a director is entitled to some reinterpretations of his own. And he did add some very interesting things of his own invention; I absolutely loved the fight scenes where Holmes thought out the steps to victory ahead of time before employing them.And the fact that you-know-who is involved in such a subtle, brilliant, barely noticeable way is icing on the cake.All in all, it is not perfectly in keeping with the canon, but I think it captures the essence of Sherlock Holmes, the overall idea, perfectly.And, most of all, it made me want to pick up my copy of the Sherlock Holmes anthology and read. And I think that – the inspiring to check out further Holmes stories – is wonderful.Kudos.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Quite a nifty plot,"The movie tries to remain spiritually faithful to the iconic figure of Holmes, although for many, it may not be the Holmes one is used to. Robert Downy Jr. & Jude Law were excellent together, they got it right on the first shot, the chemistry between them was really on point. (I guess thats because they're great Actors). Also I think If Robert Downy Jr. keeps it up he's going to have Hollywood on lock as the go to actor for the next couple of years. Overall the movie was very enjoyable and I can see it being a good re-branded franchise. So I dare to recommend it if you haven't seen it yet. , I found the film enjoyable and an homage to what's gone before, giving Holmes humanity, displaying his dark days and neuroses as well as his brilliance. Downey, despite his total lack of Holmesian physical attributes, succeeds - and Jude Law is the perfect Watson. If you're a staunch purist, skip this one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"""Mm, that's not quite right, is it? In fact, the little details are by far the most important""","This adaption of Sherlock Holmes is an extremely enjoyable experience, directed with the signature style by the exceedingly talented Guy Ritchie.I adore films set in the Victorian period and have seen this movie a couple of times now and with the same level of enthusiasm.I found this story absorbing, and compelling. Its action sequences were unique while the fight scenes were shot in slow motion with Holmes's narrative. These moments were well choreographed, and exhilarating to watch.I found Robert Downey Jnr to be a very good Sherlock Holmes (Unfortunately, just not quite distinctive as Benedict Cumberbatch). His portrayal was clever and Intelligent with the right amount of wit.Jude Law playing Dr. John Watson was a confident, and positive colleague for Holmes, and nailed the role. Rachael McAdams is a powerful actress and can make it work with just about any role she plays. Mark Strong as Lord Henry Blackwood was menacing, intellectual, and a more than adequate foe for Holmes.This was a memorable movie. They were some sequences that were a little over the top, but then again what do you expect from a Sherlock Holmes story.While this won't go down as a defining piece of cinema it does attract its target audience perfectly.

A Fantastic Investigative Story,"On my flight back from Malaysia, the last film that I decided to watch was Sherlock Holmes, I have seen this film a few times and was looking forward to seeing it again so is here my review for the film. The premise of the film sees Sherlock Holmes attempt to stop a sinister plot from destroying London at its core.Main Character
Robert Downey Jr plays the titular character and he is fantastic in the role. You really see his intelligence and the way his mind works and I thought Downey really nailed the feel of an investigator that Holmes clearly is. It is hard to take your eyes off of him on screen and that is great to see in this film.Supporting Characters
Jude Law plays Doctor Watson and he is really great too. The chemistry between him and Downey is off the charts and they just blend incredibly well and it is one of the real driving forces of the film and his performance drives that.Rachel McAdams plays Irene Adler and she is a lot of fun here. She is a very quick witted character and she also had great chemistry with Downey. The inclusion of her character is mainly to set up the sequel but she is fun to watch.Mark Strong plays the villain Lord Blackwood and though the character isn't particularly interesting Strong does enough to deliver a fun performance and makes him the appropriate adversary for Holmes in this film.Kelly Reilly plays Mary Morstan who is Watson's Fiancé and even though she isn't in the film a huge amount but she is a fun addition and the constant arguing with Holmes is pretty entertaining.Story
The story is really interesting, it is a genuine mystery and watching Holmes and Watson try to figure it out with all the twists and turns is interesting. There is also clearly a development in their partnership and that grows as the film progresses, the villains motivation isn't the best but the way the film explains it makes it sound really cool and interesting.Script
The script has some really quick and charming dialogue. The characters interact really well and the dialogue makes them more interesting. Though I will say that this film does fall short on its dramatic moments and dialogue, I never felt fear for the characters or really care about them being in peril even though the film does try.Style
I really liked the visual style of this film, old school London looks really great and it just feels like a world that director Guy Ritchie would create and it very much fit this interpretation of Sherlock Holmes. The action scenes were also really good, they use some unique techniques to explain the action and I really liked it.Overall
Overall, Sherlock Holmes is a fantastic film that is a really fun watch. The cast do a great job and I loved the investigative nature of the film. Definitely give this film a go and I am pretty sure you will really enjoy it like I do.Rating - 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

You get to travel up and down the Thames river. You get to cross the bridges. It gives the feeling of being a tourist wandering at random in a time warp. It is such a feast for the eyes. There is no stinting ever. Holmes and Watson and young and combative. They complain about each other. Watson is not the traditional all-suffering. He is feisty. There is quite a bit of physical fighting, a bit too much for my taste. However, to make it interesting, they invented a new fighting style, vaguely reminiscent of kung foo, and a whole new way to photograph it. The movie plays with the supernatural. The villain appears to have supernatural powers. You see different degrees of skepticism. You find yourself wondering how they can possibly explain everything without the supernatural. It is all explained at the end, Agatha Christie style. The plot whips along at breakneck pace. It quite hard to keep up trying figure out who is doing what and why.

A Riveting Resurgence of the Detective Genre,"In the cinematic landscape, where reimagining timeless classics can often be a perilous endeavor, Guy Ritchie's ""Sherlock Holmes"" (2009) emerges as a triumphant resurrection of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's iconic detective. With a masterful blend of wit, action, and a dash of steampunk aesthetics, this rendition not only pays homage to the literary source but propels Holmes and Watson into a thrilling new era.At the heart of this cinematic tour de force is Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of the inimitable Sherlock Holmes. Downey's Holmes is a revelation-a brilliant mind trapped in a maelstrom of eccentricity, driven by a relentless pursuit of truth. His chemistry with Jude Law's Dr. John Watson is nothing short of electric, providing a dynamic and nuanced portrayal of one of literature's most enduring partnerships.Guy Ritchie's directorial flair injects a pulsating energy into the narrative, seamlessly weaving together Holmes's deductive prowess with heart-stopping action sequences. The slow-motion sequences that unravel Holmes's analytical mind are not just stylistic indulgences but windows into the labyrinthine corridors of genius. The film effortlessly balances the cerebral with the visceral, creating a cinematic experience that is as intellectually stimulating as it is viscerally satisfying.Visually, ""Sherlock Holmes"" is a feast for the eyes. The meticulous recreation of Victorian London, enhanced by Philippe Rousselot's cinematography, immerses the audience in a world where gas lamps cast long shadows and intrigue lurks around every fog-laden corner. Hans Zimmer's evocative score further elevates the film, becoming an integral part of the narrative and accentuating the mood with every note.The narrative, though unapologetically action-oriented, remains faithful to the spirit of Conan Doyle's detective stories. The inclusion of Holmes's arch-nemesis, Lord Blackwood, adds a layer of mystique and danger, providing a worthy adversary for our brilliant detective. The plot unfolds with the precision of a well-crafted mystery, keeping audiences on the edge of their seats until the final revelation.In conclusion, ""Sherlock Holmes"" (2009) is a masterclass in revitalizing a classic character for the modern audience. Ritchie's vision, combined with Downey and Law's stellar performances, breathes new life into the detective genre. This film not only honors the legacy of Conan Doyle but establishes itself as a captivating and enduring addition to the pantheon of cinematic adaptations. For fans of Holmesian intrigue and newcomers alike, this rendition is nothing short of elementary brilliance.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
A solid mixture of costume theatre and violence,"Sherlock Holmes. Most people know him from the stories as a somewhat dusty investigator with a peculiar pipe and hat, solving various crimes by dry logic deduction. How does a figure like that thrive in these cinematic times? I guess if the film had been made completely based on the original characters it would have turned sour.But leave it to Guy Ritchie to pick up the character(s) in the stories and make them into a successful combination of brutal violence and costume drama. Sticking close enough to the original tales and their relations as well as adding enough flavors of current time dark cinema and his own personal traits (the feel of typical British crime-comedy that made him famous) this film works like a charm. Fast paced, a sinister plot and many logic deductions (amongst many other things).Downey and Law do well as Holmes and Watson. Holmes comes across as highly intelligent, yet thoroughly vile and somewhat of an egocentric bastard while Watson comes across as the help against his will and better knowledge. Added together they make a formidable mix. Of the other characters there a few that jump out performance wise but all in all its the mixture that works best.

We in Russia are spoiled (in a good way) by our excellent TV series that were praised in the UK, so the new version was a bit of a red herring to me, as well as a red rag. But then, I watched it and later bought a DVD and watched again, and then I must say - this is a tremendously well-done film! Robert Downey JR has done a great job and his Sherlock is young, vivid, often ferocious, funny and really witty. he embodies that spirit of adventure that he loves so much. And then, there is that old, dirty, smelly, muddy London with gas lamps and filthy streets... The spirit of the time, despite some minor goofs, is depicted here very well. I loved the film due to its bright tone, fast tempo and mild humor. That is a real treat and a must-see!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
"A sheer delight, full of laughs, thrills, and a heap of fun.","Guy Ritchie's take on the classic stories from Arthur Conan Doyle is most pleasurable, taking place in a perfectly captured atmospheric old London setting.It sees well-known characters Sherlock Holmes (a masterful Robert Downey Jr.) and his partner Dr. John Watson (a very winsome Jude Law) facing a whole host of foes and challenges.Watson is set to marry the lovely Mary Morstan (Kelly Reilly), an idea that Holmes is unsettled by, but this is the least of his problems.The dark and mysterious Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong makes the most of his screen time, being even more sinister than he was in Stardust) is terrorising the town, claiming to be an immortal sorcerer who will cause unimaginable destruction unless parliament succumbs to his rule.An inept and corrupt police force, led by the awful Inspector Lestrade (Eddie Marsan) is constantly getting in Holmes' way, and there are some among them who have loyalty to Blackwood.Though undeniably their greatest obstacle is the beautiful but sneaky Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams at her most alluring) who shares an infatuation with Holmes, yet Blackwood also has a hold on her.The action sequences are gratifyingly modest and therefore much more engaging, involving only the conflicts of a few characters.What is also admirable is the fact that it is made easy to follow despite the audience not being as sharp-eyed and ingenious as Holmes The cast is absolutely sensational, including the supporting actors that include Robert Maillet and James Fox. McAdams and Strong have an enormous impact with their marvellously theatrical performances, while Law and Downey Jr. play their parts with a forceful and effective subtlety that is even better.The film is a sheer delight, full of laughs, thrills, and a heap of fun.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Brilliant Crime thriller in victorian London,"What a wonderful movie! How this doesn't win something in the Oscars will be beyond me. Last week I saw Invictus and raved about it but this is marginally better in all quarters and I hedge a bet on Robert Downey for best actors over Morgan Freeman or Gerard Butler (Law Abiding Citizen). Tremendous entertainment which had the whole audience at the cinema laughing and crying with every moment right to the end. Robert Downey did indeed act Holmes to perfection by his own interpretation if not by the Holmes we might have expected from the Conan Doyle novel. Watched it with my 11 year old son who didn't flinch at the scenes when Holmes was displaying his fighting skills but he plays PS2 most days so he has seen it all, got the teeshirt! Great great simple dialogue between Holmes and Watson but I didn't appreciate even just two American actors noticeably appearing in the movie and allowing their presence. the first was the politician guy who died with the gun in his hand and the second was the woman (Mary) giving Holmes grief at the end. Amazing reconstructed scenes of victorian London, even great thought in detail to the street scenes, wow, great stuff! Definitely a movie to watch again on DVD because there is so much to absorb and wonder about the movie. Powerful entertainment! Jude Law for me was highly disguised as Watson and acted well though Downey excelled from his good support in 'Soloist' to surely claim an Oscar for best actor. Is this another British movie getting Oscar credit?",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Yay Robert Downey Jr.!!!!,"I have never read the Sherlock Holmes novels (I never read the classics willingly). So, for all those who haven't read the books, like me, my opinion is that this movie was great and you should see it. I can't say how the movie compares to the book, so for those who have read the book, my opinion might not help. That aside, I'll now discuss why this movie is more worthwhile to see than junk like Avatar.The acting is very good, Robert Downey Jr. being my favorite in the cast. I felt he captured who I imagined Sherlock Holmes to be like (again, I haven't read the books). Jude Law as Watson did a great job, too. The two had great chemistry and had the exact same relationship as Shawn and Gus from the TV show Psych. They are best friends who solve mysteries together. Holmes, like Shawn, is laid back, funny, and can cause a bit of trouble once in a while. Watson, like Gus, is more uptight and a stickler for the rules. He's neat and orderly, and seems to get pulled into the mayhem by Holmes. They work great together, but they also disagree on a lot of things. Watching them on the screen together was enjoyable.The screenplay was very well done. The action scenes were thrilling and the clues Holmes found along the way kept me thinking the whole time. I was on the edge of my seat through most of the film, and the story was complex, but somehow easy to understand once Holmes solved the case at the end. The villain was mysterious and chilling; watching the things he did to people and his dark face was pretty exciting.I was very impressed with the music in this movie. It seemed to capture the essence of where the story took place and the environment or setting of the story. If a blind person went to see the movie, I imagine they would be able to picture a setting similar to the one that actually exists just by listening to the music. The setting was also captured well by the lighting. The movie took place in a dark, dank little town in England. The lighting went along with the music to truly express what this time was like and to capture the darkness of the story.The special effects, while not Avatar quality, were believable. What I mean by this is the special effects didn't make the movie, which in every case is a good thing. Avatar got millions of dollars and people won't shut up about it only because it's special effects are ''ground-breaking''. There is no actual story, which to me is a vital part of A truly incredible movie. Sherlock Holmes had a good story, great characters, and didn't overdo the special effects, and that is what makes it great. So, to sum it up, the characters were great, the story was exciting, the fighting and action scenes were thrilling, and the music and lighting were extremely fitting to the movie. Go see Sherlock Holmes and you won't regret it. Robert Downey Jr. is amazing and I can't wait to see him in Iron Man 2!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Holmes As Doyle Wrote Him,"There aren't many movies around that dare to reinvent something both literary and cinematic that is beloved by readers and movie-goers alike, but action director Guy Ritchie has dared in a big way ...and succeeded beyond my expectations.When Sir Arthur Conan Doyle created Sherlock Holmes (A Study in Scarlet, 1887), he made Holmes a roughshod, drug-addled genius with keen deductive powers. This made him a person that lay-readers could identify with. A man with problems, but with unique abilities that were much in demand. Coming off the heels of the Victorian era, too, Holmes was – in a very real way – a person coming out of that stuffy time period and into the more loose and modern one. Again, something readers of the time could identify with.Although the books live on in perpetuity, most of the population over the age of 40 are probably more familiar with director Roy Neill's television series starring the estimable Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Dr. Watson (if you're under 40 you're probably hooked on the hit TV series HOUSE M.D. which has more than just a passing familiarity with Doyle's character). Basil recreated the character of Holmes and also cleaned him up quite a bit. No drugs. Clean shaven. A real gentleman. In Doyle's literary works, however, this is far from the case ... which brings us to this new manifestation: the 2009 cinematic work starring Robert Downey Jr. (TROPIC THUNDER) as Holmes and Jude Law (REPO MEN) as Watson.Downey Jr. is one of our great new actors. He is a chameleon in every sense of the word. Which is why I found his Holmes to be extremely well played. From his migraines to drugging Watson's beloved dog, Downey Jr. truly encompassed everything that Doyle wrote about. He's both brilliant and prone to folly; seeks a new case that's semi-interesting but is just as likely to seek out a new drug to make him feel more interested; and only has eyes for one woman, the lovely Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams, THE FAMILY STONE) who is just as much trouble as any drug or migraine.This film is, hopefully, a reawakening of the Sherlock Holmes mystique; but a reawakening with Doyle's truly flawed character and not some scrubbed clean version. The ending of this movie certainly leaves open the possibility of a sequel. Let's hope that happens.One final word of warning in case you didn't get what I was saying: this isn't your grandmas Sherlock Holmes. If you want Rathbone, go watch him. If you want Doyle's Holmes, check out Guy Ritchie's newest (and more accurate) interpretation.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Sherlock Genius Holmes,"Sherlock Holmes is one of my all-time favorite movies, and I can watch it anytime, any day. Robert Downey Jr. As Sherlock Holmes and Jude Law as Dr. Watson are amazing.

The way Holmes solves cases with his sharp mind and unique methods is fascinating.The story is interesting, with a mix of dark magic and science, and the Victorian-era setting adds to the charm. The action scenes, especially where Holmes plans every move in his mind, are really cool. Lord Blackwood is a great villain, and the twists in the story make it even better.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
A really enjoyable adventure,"The 2009 Sherlock Holmes has nothing in common with the Holmes created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.This one is a an who likes women, liquor and street fights and uses his abilities for his own benefit. Directed by Guy Ritchie, his view of the movie is quite dark, full of action and adventure and with a bit of humor. It has a fast paced rhythm which makes the movie pretty enjoyable. The landscapes are very good, you really feel like watching a 1800's London and the costume design is also very convincing. The story located around the XIX century, shows us detective Sherlock Holmes and his partner Watson engage in a battle of wits and brawn with a nemesis whose plot is a threat to all of England, is interesting, with a little changes from the original Conan Doyle's novel but just for the benefit of the movie and the plot is very well developed. The cast is excellent, Robert Downey Jr. as Holmes is brilliant, definitely this role was made for him. Jude Law is Dr. Watson, his performance is impeccable. Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler is quite good and Mark Strong in the role of Lord Blackwood was convincing enough. To conclude, Sherlock Holmes is a very entertaining and enjoyable movie, worthy in every aspect and fully recommendable.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Presenting.......Sherlock Holmes by Guy Ritchie,"Sherlock Holmes is one fictional character which has been regularly portrayed on the wide screen . And though the current version may not rank among my favourites it is not by any means ordinary. Holmes has been given a new and refreshing look by the director . In fact all those who are acquainted with the novels would concur that what Ritchie has done is too simply bring to light the till now downplayed aspects of Holmes personality viz..his remarkable combat skills and other such muscular attributes.Almost everybody has this image of Holmes being a lean fellow with a magnifying glass in one hand and a smoking pipe in another. Ritchie has tries to expose the strength behind the lean body structure and does not shy away from including scenes where Holmes fighting skills are the sole object of attention.Moving forward , it was nice to see Jude Law as Dr. Watson.The screenplay is for me the most interesting part of this feature. For some the whole tone of the movie was divorced from the essence of Holmes. A bit too loud too violent too exuberant and fanciful some said. Many were expecting the movie to be an emulator of the TV series produced in the preceding decades. For me the movie was a welcome aberration and deviation from the type cast image of Holmes . OK, I agree that the director failed to study Holmes as far as some aspects were concerned and that some sequences bore a striking resemblance with the action flicks of today, but what is wrong in that? I believe a movie should represent the best of it's age and not be a second rate reproduction of the by-gone era.It is true that the movie's brilliance sunk in as time progressed and almost a week after I had watched it did I fully understand the nature of Ritchie's accomplishment.For the tight script, good performances and the unique Colour given to Holmes and his train by the director I rate it highly.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
A Great Film Adaption,"Sherlock holmes... I've seen many adaptions of this story, through games, movies, TV shows and even books its a great one.

I highlybrecommend you watch this, I've been meaning to for a while I'm glad I caught it tonight.Sherlock has always had a compelling feel to it, one of the best Sherlock stories I've seen, cant wait to see the next one!

"Great modernized update of the story and characters, without abandoning its classic themes.","Being a Guy Ritchie fan will not automatically mean you'll like ""Sherlock Holmes"" but this also goes the other way around. You really don't have to be a Guy Ritchie fan or familiar with his previous work to appreciate this movie! This is really different from any other Guy Ritchie movie really, due to the foremost reason that this movie has an actual multi-million budget behind it. Ritchie is mostly known for his little British crime movies, such as ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch."". But there is nothing little about this movie though! Of course it still features some typical Ritchie touches in it, which mostly can be seen back in the movie its characters and its humor.Sherlock Holmes is of course one of the best known characters out of literary history but at the same time it's also one of the most old fashioned ones. He lived in a very typical British time period and he had a very distinctive old fashioned look to him, as well as some old fashioned customs. I can therefore understand the need of updating the character and story, which is something this movie does very well. It makes ""Sherlock Holmes"" a hip modern movie to watch but at the same time it manages to keep all of the things in it that made him such a wonderful and strong character.And by saying they updated the character I don't necessarily mean that they changed him. The character is actually very close to the one in the books, by Arthur Conan Doyle, which some people don't seem to realize, since they only know the character from the older Sherlock Holmes movies and TV stuff, in which Sherlock Holmes was a way more sophisticated and well mannered person.It also made Robert Downey Jr. seem like an odd choice to play the titular character but he was perfect for the approach they were taking with this movie and its main character. Same goes for Jude Law really. A pretty boy playing the good old doctor doesn't seem like a logic choice but again, it really suits the approach the movie is taking and besides, Jude Law does a great job with the character. No matter how much you like Peter Cushing or Basil Rathbone in their classic roles as the famous detective, you will also really like Robert Downey Jr., even though he gives a completely different spin on the character.The movie isn't based on any of the classic Arthur Conan Doyle novels and so is a totally original one, though it's still really consistent- and fits in with the Arthur Conan Doyle stories. It's because it uses all of the classic themes, as well as a sort of supernatural undertone to it, which is something I always liked within a Sherlock Holmes story and movie. No, the story of this movie perhaps isn't that special but it at least provides the movie with plenty of entertainment and fun moments.Lots of the movie its budget went into its large scale action sequences but also a large portion of it went into the movie its looks. The movie entirely recreates 19th century London, which is all fine looking but also a bit of a distraction at times when the movie pans out or decides to give you a wide shot to show off with what they have achieved. It took me out of the movie sometimes but this is really the biggest complaint I can think off regarding this movie, which should tell you something about how great and fun it is!I'm actually more excited and anxious about seeing more new Sherlock Holmes movies rather than new James Bond flicks!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Sherlock Holmes is back and stronger than ever in the twenty-first century!,"This film is one of the best ones of the year 2009! First of all, it creates a charming and interesting atmosphere in beautiful words and images flavoured with great special effects in an ancient London.Second, the main actors are doing a great job, they are really cool, charming and have their unique forces and advantages and personal mistakes or disadvantages.Third, the story presents a lot of really interesting twists, very intelligent ideas and mysterious events which are all revealed in a logical and stunning way in the end which creates a really good tension.Fourth, the movie is in the key of the legendary character on which were based many really solid books and movies, but it is much more than a copy as it is presents quite refreshing, authentic and modern characters and not an old-fashioned adaption. The movies balances between traditions, the cult established around the characters and a modern blockbuster with refreshing actors and atmosphere. That's quite courageous and may not be pleasant for the more traditional viewers and old fans of the books or movies, but it is innovating, interesting and opens this fantastic world to a younger public. Sherlock Holmes and Co. still exists in the twenty-first century and they are stronger than ever.Go and watch this movie as traditional cults and refreshing elements are mixed to a brilliant and diversified movie! And let's wait for a possible sequel!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Better than many remember...,"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic crime-solver has been portrayed on film more than any other literary figure. The new version, starring Robert Downey Jr. as Holmes and Jude Law as Watson, has marketed the sleuth as an action hero instead of an intellectual. To my pleasant surprise, the film itself is true to its source material and Holmes' legendary mind is front and center in the narrative. The recreation of turn-of-the-century London is exquisite in its detail and the story builds steam as it goes on (indeed, I found myself enjoying it more and more as it progressed).Downey, an American, flawlessly portrays the British lead, while Law's Watson is portrayed as less of a sidekick and more of a partner. The two have fantastic buddy chemistry, and their good- natured bickering is a delight. Parents should be aware that this PG-13 film, while very light on offensive language and sexuality (a woman's bare back is seen, as is a man's bare chest in a different scene, and there is one innuendo) does have a good deal of action violence and some blood. Also, the storyline involves the occult, which is displayed as evil and to be combated, but its portrayal may still make some uncomfortable. Sherlock Holmes comes recommended to those who enjoy action films with substance.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
The World's Greatest Detective is back; in a new old-fashioned way!,"The foggy gas-lit streets of 19th century London. The shared rooms at 221B Baker Street. The deerstalker hat, the violin, the pipe, the array of scattered notes, chemicals and weapons and the man, the legendary figure behind all these trappings...Sherlock Holmes. Ever since Arthur Conan Doyle exposed this, the greatest fictional creation in the history of England, if not the world, Holmes and his trusty companion Dr. Watson have enthralled millions with their antics in print and on screen, both big and small, light-hearted or dark, simple and complex...from the goldmine of Doyle's original short stories and novels to the propagandist wartime atmosphere of the Basil Rathbone films, to the Jeremy Brett TV series par excellence and much more. It was the latter actor's masterful portrayal of Holmes that has invariably stuck in the public consciousness and as such most people perceive Holmes as a highly introverted intellectual, a perfect middle-aged Victorian gentleman albeit slightly neurotic, a man more accustomed to using his mind than his fists. However in the process, people did forget that Conan Doyle's Holmes was a multi-faceted character, a man of action in addition to his intellectual pursuits, and not necessarily the prim and proper gentleman his screen adaptations often displayed him as being. Guy Ritche however has boldly set out to reinvent Holmes for a 21st century audience, albeit keeping in mind Arthur Conan Doyle's vision for the character and especially the 'other side' to him that was largely neglected previously.The Holmes played by Robert Downey Jr. is not merely a detective (though his feats of detection are no less legendary than those of the literary version of the character)-he is also a legendary hero, a one man army, a Jack of All Trades-a martial arts expert, swordsman, shooter, master of disguise among other things. Far from being the perfect gentleman, he is a misfit, a bit of a rogue, blessed with a sardonic wit and a tinge of arrogance that he subtly and humorously reveals at times. Perhaps a greater departure from the previous screen versions of Watson is Jude Law's rendition of the doctor as a young, capable and highly competent man of action, an amateur detective in his own right. Holmes and Watson's relationship in this film, which critics have misinterpreted as being homosexual in nature, is in fact intensely amusing. Also notable is Rachel MacAdams portrayal of the femme fatale Irene Adler, the master thief and temptress who also happens to be the only woman Holmes has ever really cared for. And Mark Strong completes the strong cast with his powerful portrayal of the villainous Lord Blackwood who harnesses one of the greatest and deadliest forces the world has ever known: the power of belief and superstition.Ritche may portray Holmes and Watson in the 19th century albeit he portrays them from a 21st century artistic viewpoint. The characters we see are Doyle's characters but from a modern perspective. For instance, Watsons exasperation with Holmes more unnatural behavior, while manifested rather subtly in the original stories is emphasized greatly in this film. Holmes and Watson's fighting prowess while no doubt alluded to in the stories, is vividly portrayed in the film. Even Holmes's attraction towards Adler, while very subtle and discreet in the Doyle stories, is made somewhat blatantly evident here. This modernization of perspective does not take away from the characters but rather enhances them greatly and makes them far more relevant and relatable to the present day cinema audiences.Also to be commended is the vivid reconstruction of Victorian-era London.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
From mild fan anxiety to a very pleasant surprise,"I like Sherlock Holmes.
I like the books.
I like the old Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce movies.
I was not particularly keen on Robert Downey Jr, Jude Law or the gor-blimey direction of Guy Ritchie.
So it was with trepidation that I approached this new movie version of the Baker St sleuth. Ready to find fault I found myself warmly engaged from the start.
The good chemistry between Downey and Law is a joy throughout. There is something tragi-comically Withnail and I about them so, if Withnail floats your boat, this may be the Holmes for you.
The use of CGI is not overbearing and creates a very credible Holmesian London.
The supporting actors are, without exception, excellent; special credit to Mark Strong, Rachel McAdams, Eddie Marsan, Geraldine James and Kelly Reilly.
It has now become one of the films I can watch over and over; as comforting as the crackle from the hearth on a winter day.
If you, like me, are a fan of Sherlock Holmes and you have not yet watched this film then I hope it will prove as much of a pleasant surprise to you as it did to me.

Not bad. Not bad at all.,"MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS... or not...Being a fan of Sherlock Holmes books, I rather liked this movie. It had a lot of references to the books, but of course thats the only thing what it had common with the books. But no one ever said the movie is based on books, it is based on the main idea and the characters. I really liked the interpretation of those characters, especially the more agile Watson. At the beginning I was thinking, like ""what is this black magic mumbo-jumbo""... But don't worry, i'll get explained eventually. At the end of a movie we are made aware of doctor Moriarty, what hopefully leads as to the sequel soon. Btw I also quite a lot like another movie based loosely on Sherlock Holmes characters: ""Without a Clue"", starring Michael Caine and Ben Kingsley.

The smaller roles are played with so much fervour. As for Mark Strong, he is brilliant and works with all of the incredible imagery thrown in to his scenes so well.

"Conan Doyle for ""actionists""... Well directed and played though","The script is rather loosely based on Conan Doyle's characters and events, enabling to create a story beyond - luckily without much of incredibility. The events roll and they are inter-twisted and at multiple levels; thanks to explanations and flashbacks they are easier to follow. The characters are deliberated well and even smaller appearances have a significance and are played by decent performers. The cast is, of course, great, combining excellent male actors from both sides of Atlantic - Robert Downey, Jr. as Sherlock Holmes, Jude Law as Dr. John Watson, Mark Strong as Lord Blackwood, Eddie Marsan as Inspector Lestrade... Holmes-Watson dialogs are catchy, there are ""sizzles"" and chemistry between them is spite of their mood. Female characters are rather sketchy, Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler was uninviting to me; Kelly Reilly (as Mary) is more talented actress, but she spent too little time on screen.A pleasant action movie to spend around 2 hours with - perhaps not then if you are serious admirer of Conan Doyle's works.

Best Holmes yet for the theater,"Off all the Sherlock content I have seen this was the best for the big screen so far. I was a bit worried going in that it would feel like a long TV show or crime drama. Most of my Holmes experience is book or old TV shows and I love it but it does come off as built for the small screen. This is miles beyond a CSI action flick in all the right ways. I thought the casting was perfect, although going in I was uncertain, and the acting was a joy to watch. I saw this over Christmas with my Wife and my Mother and they both liked it but not as much as I did. This was the compromise between ""Avatar"" for me and some ""It's Complicated"" for them and I think we all came out happy with our choice.

Another Great Movie from Guy Ritchie,"As not a fan of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, I watched this movie, and I really entertained. First of all for a detective movie, Guy Ritchie is one of few directors that I can think of. Christopher Nolan (The Prestige) and Neil Burger (The Illusionist) could be the other director choices. Also the script is well written, at the end of the story there are no cracks and you really enjoy when Holmes explains everything at the end of the movie. Fight scenes are not the best but I laughed at some scenes. Robert Downey Jr. did a really good job as Sherlock Holmes. Also Jude Law is a good choice for Dr. Watson. Mark Strong is a charismatic villain and I think he fits this type of characters. Soundtracks are absorbing the fight scenes, and when there is a funny scene again the music changes and it really fits to that funny scene.Overall, my vote is 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Sherlock is revisited in spectacular fashion....,"The staid old world of the 19th century detective has been remastered by ""British Gangster movie"" director Guy Ritchie, and to my major surprise has done a terrific job. Sherlock Holmes is no longer the hunting cap doffed man with the cherub & wise side-back.

A great condensation and reworking of the classic books.,"I was unsure of what to expect at first, given the book's wordy structure and the trailer's emphasis on the action scenes. However, I was pleasantly surprised by a very entertaining take on Sherlock Holmes. It balanced, very adeptly I might add, both action and mystery. The film is, of course, Holmes trying to get to the bottom of a mystery; the way this is done, however, is very entertaining. The look inside Holmes's mind in the form of short flashes of video, coupled with the grainy style of the movie is very compelling. I especially liked the expositions and the clever ways the film makers used to advance the plot. I feel, in fact, that I am hard pressed to come up with a reasonable complaint, given that all my expectations were met and exceeded. I suppose that it was a tad ridiculous and elaborate, but then it wouldn't be Sherlock Holmes if it was not. I guess my favorite thing about this movie was that, when I left the theater, it made me want to be able to do those crazy detective things. I know they are mostly impossible, but never the less, I really want to be able to examine a given situation and deduce something about it. I realize that the acting was not exactly Godfather level, and that it didn't really leave any haunting psychological questions about human nature in my mind, But I don't really care. It was a really awesome ride.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"

Robert presents Sherlock to us as an intelligent, entertaining, obsessive-compulsive (which explains his perception of fine details), and paranoid eccentric who has a huge hunger to the mystery.

The film was directed by Guy Ritchie and produced by Joel Silver, Lionel Wigram, Susan Downey, and Dan Lin. Whilst the screenplay was written by Michael Robert Johnson, Anthony Peckham, and Simon Kinberg, with a story by Wigram and Johnson. The film also stars Jude Law as Dr. John Watson, Mark Strong as Lord Henry Blackwood, Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler, Kelly Reilly as Mary Morstan, Eddie Marsan as Inspector Lestrade and Geraldine James as Mrs. Hudson with others. There's a ton of great performances, Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law is rightfully cast, their performances are brilliant and some of the actors best. They are perfect as the iconic duo. The accurate depiction of London during 1890, how the cinematographer and Guy Ritchie shot the city, the streets, just so many stunning shots. The production design and art direction is truly top notch. The action sequences, man, they're terrific. Some in slowmotion which makes us see through the eyes of our detective, then the one take sequence at the harbor (freight place) brilliant! Philippe Rousselot is one of those great cinematographers that make each scene have so much life, so much heart. The whole film and production has a lot of heart, from the performances with Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law being fans of the source material, same goes for the director and many more. Sherlock Holmes looks incredible, for the editing and production design, but mostly because of the work Philippe Rousselot did. The camera work and distinct locations, cinematography is perfect in every way. Hans Zimmer brings us a superb musical score that I can only describe as THE Sherlock Holmes soundtrack.Detective Sherlock Holmes and his stalwart partner Watson engage in a battle of wits and brawn with a nemesis whose plot is a threat to all of England.Last time I watched this was probably back in 2014 or earlier, this is my second time and it's better this time around. With me being older and having more knowledgeable of Sherlock Holmes and all the stories, I think this might have been my first time watching anything related to Sherlock Holmes and I was hooked. What I noticed a year or so later was how Jude Law was actually in an episode of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, where he was younger. That series is also set during the Victorian age where this film is set, it's a must watch! But this film, Sherlock Holmes, is truly a superb film. There's much to love, maybe the supernatural aspects of the film is a bit unnecessary as it feels too much at times, but it isn't the first time Sherlock Holmes have leaned into supernatural aspects. I can't praise Robert Downey Jr enough, he actually won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy for this film and rightfully so. The film was also nominated for two Academy Awards, Best Original Score and Best Art Direction. The amount of research the actors and filmmakers did to create an accurate adaption to its source material, it's as a great action film as it's a crime film. For any fan of the genre or Sherlock Holmes, I can only recommend this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Robert D Jnr best work ever,Now how good is Sherlock. The Robert D Jnr version. His support actors all spot on Law McAdams et al. The large French thug the classic London Bobby Inspector even the bulldog. Massive. The follow up Sherlocks also very good. Hans Zimmer theme is electric. Mark Strong a top bad guy. Special effects and CGI well done. Robert D Jnr best work he looks fit also. Super who done it stuff in its own way or how done it.Patrick.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
DIDOMAN: The game is a foot,"Guy Ritchie has conjured up some black magic, and given us an exciting, fun and mischievous Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) with Dr Watson (Jude Law) at his side forever getting him out of trouble. The two are great together, playing up to each other like old school room mates.Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) is a serial killing Satanist and London is in fear of his dark powers. Holmes and Watson are hired to find the truth behind the mystery, meeting up along the way with classic characters like Irene Dunn (Rachel McAdams) and Inspector Lestrade. In Guy Ritchie, lock stock and barrel style, the action is calculated and logical, and compliments Sir Arthur Conan Doyles' vision of Sherlock Holmes as the avid boxer and martial artist, along with his powers of observation, deductive skills and master of disguise.The recreation of 19th Century London is amazing, especially with the attention to detail as Holmes walks around a busy, bustling and growing city landscape. New fans will take to him and old fans wont be disappointed as the movie keeps to the canon set by Sir Arthur Conan Doyles' novels and stories, although there is no mention of Holmes darker side of experimentation's with drugs, but maybe that comes later, along with newer foes to catch in the franchise to follow.Being a big Sherlock Holmes fan I loved it, but I would say even new fans who know nothing of the famous character will like this fresh update on the old Holmes, and hopefully get some kids out there to pick up a book and delve deeper...

Sherlock Holmes: From Novel to Big Screen!,"I like English director Guy Ritchie for his stylish presentation and Sherlock Holmes is no different. Based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's original theme, this new film gives you fresh feeling about world's greatest detective ever lived (in people's heart!).Being an American, Robert Downey Jr. performed the role of Holmes superbly, except some accent related glitches. And, not to mention, the way Jude Law presented Dr. Watson, it simply gives you a feeling that this pair arrived directly from the novels. People often dislike books turning into films as it significantly changes original characters' appeal. However, this movie, perhaps an exception as being a book-version lover, I liked the film-version no less.I rated it 8 on 10 but would probably add an extra half if the length of the movie was a little shorter. Happy viewing!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Excellent Movie,"From beginning all the way to the end, the movie was fun and entertaining. The setting, atmosphere, costumes, effects are all perfect. The way it touches upon secret societies and sends a message that all the world is controlled by secret societies and orders for centuries. But off course Sherlock Holmes is there to save the world from them. I've found one blooper in the movie and that's when sherlock says ""it's a honey found in Turkey and called crazy honey disease""... In 19th century, it was actually Ottoman Empire and not Turkey which was odd to me because the movie is so well put together with details. But Overall, it's excellent.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
Sherlock Holmes astounded me,"I don't have a whole lot to say about the film other than I throughly enjoyed the entire experience. I found that the film had a little bit of everything so that everyone in a family or a group pf friends would be entertained and satisfied by their choice at the theater. The film is filled from beginning to end with a witty and face paced script so none will be left to become bored at any moment. There's a good mix of romance, action, suspense, and cinematography that will keep the entire audience's attention throughout the film. I also found the cast to be a very well put together grouping, all amazing talent who played their parts very well. My entire family enjoyed the film and are excited to see if the future holds a sequel. If that is the case, we certainly will be seeing it and we have suggested seeing this one to many of our own friends.If you're looking for a good movie to see anytime soon, I highly suggest this film. You won't be let down.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
The movie deserves an Oscar,"It is truly, insanely great. This movie is hands-down my favorite of the 21 century, and quite possibly, ever.The idea of re-setting Holmes into a different era, and then NOT simply inserting the original character, but truly re-imagining him, is a great idea but fraught with challenges.What the team and the cast have managed to pull off with this series may even he says, almost heretically surpass the original.The stories are by turn scary, funny and clever. And there is one famous quote after another in them - To Holmes she was the woman, quite a three pipe problem, the dog in the night-time, exclude the impossible - Agatha Christie, Dorothy Sayers, Donna Leon were/are good writers but they are not in th class of Arthur Conan Doyle.Some of the pastiche Sherlock Holmes writers are worth reading. I would try Orlando Pearson who uses Holmesian techniques to answer questions such as is climate change happening, was the Resurrection a historical event and why did the baking crash happen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Mystery"
