Cute and wonderfully inventive,"I heard that this movie was very good, and after seeing seeing it myself, I have to say I heartily concur. While not my favourite film of the year, and the film never tries to be that, Despicable Me is cute and wonderfully inventive. While it could have been a little longer, what made Despicable Me work was a number of things. The animation for starters is stunning, I liked the colours and character designs but it was the backgrounds and retro-futurist design that blew me away, while the gadgetry is ingenious.The music fits very well with the film and is memorable without being overly ambitious or simplistic, the story is ceaselessly inventive and fast paced with a surprisingly clever subplot about the importance of family. The characters also add a lot, Gru is wonderfully zany especially and I found it impossible not to fall in love with his minions, they are so cute. But my favourite assets of Despicable Me are the humour and the voice cast. The writing is just excellent, it was so funny and incredibly smart without feeling too much, while the voice work is exemplary especially from Steve Carell whose brilliant vocals add a lot to the film's success.Overall, a truly great film with a lot to like. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
One of the Sweetest Villains Ever,"When one pyramid of Egypt is stolen, the despicable suburban villain Gru feels frustrated since he considers himself the greatest criminal mind ever. However he plans to steal the moon, in the greatest heist of history, with the support of the evil Dr. Nefario and his army of minions. Gru intends to hire a loan in the Bank of Evil (former Lehman Brothers) to build a rocket and steal the shrink weapon to reduce the size of the moon. But the banker Mr. Perkins intends to invest in the young Vector, who actually had stolen the pyramid. When Gru robs the shrink weapon, Vector steals it from him and kept the weapon in his impenetrable fortress that is protected by state of art security system. Gru sees that the orphans Margo, Edith and Agnes from Miss Hattie's Home for Girls have full access to Vector's house to sell cookies. Gru plots a scheme, adopting the three girls to use them to recover the shrink weapon from Vector. But the three little girls change the behavior of Gru and his minions.""Despicable Me"" is a sort of contemporary version of the Charles Dickens' classic novel ""A Christmas Carol"" and a highly entertaining animation with one of the sweetest villain ever, three adorable little girls and a group of adorable minions. The story is not corny but human, and the jokes with Bill Gates that is the source of inspiration of the nerd Vector and with the investment banking Lehman Brothers Holding Inc. that declared bankruptcy in 2008 and affected the lives of small private investors are witty. In the end, Gru is not the criminal mastermind that he supposed to be. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Meu Malvado Favorito"" (""My Favorite Meanie"")",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Despicable See,"Since Toy Story 3 is in theatres, it's rather knee-jerk to compare Despicable Me to the animation giant. But you shouldn't. Despicable Me doesn't have the heavy, dark tones of the final Toy Story and, therefore, is probably better suited to smaller children. As with the best family films, though, adults will love this story as much - if not more - than their little ones.And here's why. It is incredibly rare to see a single dad portrayed in such a positive light. While Gru has an admittedly ""bad"" vocation, there are unbelievably sweet moments between him and the three children, probably aided by the juxtaposition of tiny girls to a large, ""bad"" guy.The nepotistic supporting cast from Saturday Night Live (even Jack McBrayer works for Tina Fey) is fantastic. One pleasant surprise was from Gru's minions: they did not steal the show. Not that they should've- the little yellow guys were funny and entertaining, but one would expect from the previews they would ultimately be the best part of the film... and I'm happy to report that wasn't true.Despicable Me is LOL funny throughout, warm, goofy, and will not disappoint. I'd say you're a despicable parent if you don't take your kids to see it immediately.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Lots to Love,"Despicable Me's teasers and trailers seemed to represent a few different movies, and that's reflected by the general segregation of comedy styles that the film begins with. At the film's start, Gru (Steve Carrell) handles the dark comedy, the trio of orphans get the cutesy comedy, and the minions handle the slapstick. As the film progresses, though, these lines begin to blur, building to a strong emotional finale and a satisfyingly complete tale. (This is one of those rare non-Pixar animated films that doesn't seem destined for sequel-dom.)The tale of rival villains isn't terribly original. Nor is the idea of a villain having his heart melted by adorable children. But the way Despicable Me blends these two ideas is just fantastic. There's humor, action, and heart -- what more could you want from an animated film?Also notable is the way the star-studded voice cast handles their characters. While there are a ton of big names filling out the roster, most of them use accents which render them familiar but not too much so. It's a different route than many animated films take, and it's refreshing. Julie Andrews and Steve Carrell especially do well at straddling the line between their trademark voices and their characters' accents. The voice that steals the movie, however, is the adorable Elsie Fisher as Agnes. Almost every line gets either a laugh or an ""Aw..."" (On a related note, I love that the orphan girls are named Edith, Margo, and Agnes. I love old names for young people.)The plot has enough twists and turns to keep things interesting, and the antics of the minions provide a nice side of fun to the proceedings. Also, their reaching contest during the credits is a fun use of 3-D that had the kids in the theater reaching for the screen.Last year was a banner year for animation, and this year seems to be following suit. How to Train Your Dragon amazed, Toy Story 3 is one of the best animated films of all time, and Despicable Me impresses. A very pleasant surprise.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
great movie for the whole family to enjoy,"I love this movie! It was so adorable, so charming & the writing was absolutely terrific! I love the animation & the characters (including the minions) were all fantastic! A MUST WATCH!",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A LAUGH RIOT! ( Will watch it again),"Despicable me is Simply Hilarious. This Movie is not just for kids, Adults are going to enjoy it even more. The youngest girl in it is sooooooo cute. Also the Small yellow minions simply adorable and so funny. The entire hall was laughing through out the movie.The plot is very interesting to keep you engrossed throughout the movie.It is not a very original plot but has the very humorous dialogs and acts.Steve Carell's is SIMPLY amazing, he is funny in a very different way...he is the king of the awkward embarrassing insulting type of comedy. You can't help but remember Steve carell's during some of the dialog deliveries.One of the funniest animation movie. Definitely Worth Watching twice.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
The minions make all the difference,"Gru (Steve Carell) is a horrible villain. Horrible as in he's not that good at it. He's petty. And when he is overtaken by another villain, he finds that he's not up to taking on Vector (Jason Segel). When he couldn't break into Vector's home, he notice 3 orphans selling cookies got in. So what's a respectable villain's suppose to do? Adopt them of course as part of an evil plan.Gru is a weird character to like, and it's not that much fun to watch at first. His minions help a lot. Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) is also good. But it's the 3 orphans causing all kinds of problem that makes it all alright. It's pretty good animation work. And there's a good story of how a bad guy learn to love. It has its funny moments and it has the minions.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
The most fun computer animated movie of 2010? Maybe so!,"""Now, the rest of the plan is simple. I fly to the moon. I shrink the moon. I grab the moon. I sit on the toilet.""Any animated movie that was released during 2010 is inevitably going to be compared to Toy Story 3, so let's get that out of the way, first. No, Despicable Me is not ""better"" than Toy Story 3. On an emotional and story-telling level, it's not nearly as profound or involving. But Despicable Me isn't trying to be profound, it's aiming for amusement and entertainment. And on those two fronts, Dreamworks has a definite success on their hands.My favorite thing about Despicable Me is how humorous it is. This is seriously the funniest animated movie that I've seen in quite a while. It has the expected amount of jokes that will give kids (and older people, too) the giggles, as well as lots of comedy that only the grown-up crowd will appreciate. It's fun to see what will pop up next (keep your eyes open for a particularly amusing reference to a particularly un-amusing scene in The Godfather).Despicable Me is also a vivid, bright movie that's pleasing to the eye in all the right ways. The character designs are stylized and fun, the soundtrack is a nice change of pace for this kind of film, and the pacing is excellent, with nary a dull stretch. The voice talent is great, but I will admit that most of them were pretty much unrecognizable. I wouldn't have known that Jason Segel, Kristin Wiig, Russell Brand, Julie Andrews, or Will Arnett were even involved, if not for the credits and the fact that I had read about them beforehand. Steve Carell and Jack McBrayer (in a small but hilarious part) are really the only voices that are easily recognizable. That's not a criticism, just an observation.So yeah, it's pretty clear that I liked this movie a lot. It reminds me most of Monsters, Inc. (a movie I absolutely love) in the way that it combines sweetness and humor in a manner that's never cloying or annoying. Watch it with your kids, watch it with your friends, watch it with your significant other, or watch it by yourself. You'll laugh, you'll cheer, you'll say ""awwww"", and you'll fall in love with Agnes, Edith, and Margo even faster than Gru does.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Very cute and adorable animated film.,"As a reviewer mentioned, this year is set to be a great year of animated films, much like the previous two years. This is proved with Pixar's unmatched (touching wood) winning streak and Dreamworks' surprise turn ""How To Train Your Dragon"", which proceeds to continue the ever- increasing ""golden years"" of computer-animated films. Universal's ""Despicable Me"" is yet another gem in an already quite-heavy bag of diamonds.With nice direction, the filmmakers were able to combine two quite unoriginal plots into one with ease and without force, and they managed to add wit, charm and smart humor to it as well. Not to mention heart. I have never heard of the filmmakers before, but this is a heck of a debut from two first-time animated film directors. The humor is also not too over the top, yet utterly hilarious and ingenious when they pop up. Most of the jokes had the entire audience rolling in the aisles. The three girls end up being adorable and lovable characters, as per the main character/protagonist/villain, whom you can't help but cheer on and care for, no matter what he does. Steve Carell is spot-on as Gru and he makes the role funnier than it should be, I mean his voice and humorous style is there behind the funny accent. And what Gru plots and does is beyond ridiculous and far too funny to be deemed ""serious"" by any cynic. Some hilarious supporting characters round out the primary cast, most notably Gru's assistant Dr. Nefarious played by Russell Brand, and I could not believe Julie Andrews was Gru's mother, I hardly recognized her voice at all! Jason Segel was hilarious as Gru's vain nemesis Vector. And let's not forget the utterly adorable and hilarious minions and their wacky antics.Technical wise, the animation is gorgeous, bright and nicely rendered with a deft touch of simplicity to it, causing it to be not too overly glossy and polished. This makes the animation look less artificial and more fluid, and this especially shows when it comes to the practical jokes. The music score is just wonderful and suits the moods of the film as they come along. The 3D is great and used quite a number of times in the movie during many effect-driven scenes, which is very impressive considering the poor up-conversion to 3D of MANY movies of late.Overall, this animated film is a great fun time for the kids and family to see, and even some teens will get many laughs out of it as well. This is a very adorable film, full of charm and heart, and with a funny and lighthearted storyline, and may the powers that be reward this at the box office, if the mediocre ""Eclipse"" isn't taking all of its viewers already. Looks like Universal's animation days are returning.Entertainment value: 10/10Overall: 7.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Despite being rather predictable, I had a great time watching this film.","I should note that I did NOT see this film in 3-D but at a non-3-D equipped theater. I am not sure that this impacted my viewing experience very much as most 3-D films I have seen really didn't benefit much from this technology--the most notable exception being ""How To Train Your Dragon""--a film that fully utilized 3-D and was amazing to see in all its glory.I should also point out that I knew exactly where this film was going long before it got there--and I am sure most adult viewers and kids probably felt the same way. Heck, just by watching the preview for the film a few months back, I knew exactly where the film would go. But despite being a formulaic film where the big curmudgeon has his heart melted by some adorable orphans, I still had a wonderful time watching the movie. Why? Because it did something that many family movies forget--it was fun!! And, on top of that, it was super-cute--but not in a cloying manner. Unless you are Genghis Khan, you WILL find the countless little yellow minions to be completely adorable and funny--a real high point for the film. Heck, a couple months before the film was released, I was at Universal Studios in Florida and just HAD to have my picture taken with one of these characters as it roamed the park--it was just so freaking cute! And, I even liked the adorable little orphans--something I usually hate in films. They had a good balance between cute, sassy and endearing.Overall, this is a wonderful 3-D movie because parents can enjoy it. I loved the characters and thought the French animators did a terrific job--with artistry that stacks up very well against the older and more established CGI studios, Pixar and Dreamworks. A pleasant treat that won't change your life...but who cares if it's so entertaining?!By the way, the plot for this film sure looks a lot like ""Megamind"" that was released just a few weeks later. I have yet to see ""Megamind"" and plan on doing so soon, so I'll update this review to reflect which of the two films I preferred. I just can't imagine how ""Megamind"" could be that much better!",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Oh, those Minions!","Oh, those adorable Minions who never speak a word anyone can understand...!The Pyramid of Giza has been stolen! Yup, apparently in this universe of super villains, it is possible to steal a pyramid. The real one has been replaced by an inflatable one (and no-one noticed this). Anyway, besides the fact this is as silly as can be, the point they're trying to make, is the fact there are super villains.Our protagonist villain is Gru, a genius inventor, who has hundreds of little yellow Minions working for him. Gru now wants to outdo the villain who stole the pyramid - by stealing the moon! A shrink ray is capable of shrinking objects (yes, even the moon). But Gru's arch enemy and fellow villain, Vector, also wants the shrink ray, and he, too, wants to steal the moon.With no means of gaining access to Vector's fort, Gru seizes the moment when he notices three orphan kids selling cookies, being allowed into the fort. So he decides to adopt the girls. Little did this supper villain realize these three girls would be able to steal his heart.What follows is a heart warning story of love and affection, discovery, and emotion. This is a wonderful story young and old can relate to. The animation is great, and those minions will have you crying with laughter. They are show stealers!! Oh, you gotta love this movie! This was fabulous.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Despicable... Au contraire!,"First of all, I am real, not one of those big studios planted minions that come to IMDb to talk wonders about their new releases. You can check my history to prove that.Second of all, to make your time worth, let me tell you what kind of movies I like and/or dislike (you know, to see if my taste is compatible with yours).Taking into account only what would be considered ""family friendly movies"", Pixar cannot be topped. From Pixar I believe that ""The Incredibles"" is its under appreciated best product, although I have a soft spot for ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Up"" (hey, I agree, ""Toy Story"" and ""Monsters Inc."" are awesome!). Their worst effort is without a doubt ""Cars"" (I almost don't even like it), but even that is above a lot of other crap from other studios.I like the first ""Shrek"", ""Kung-Fu Panda""; found ""9"" and ""Coraline"" a little bit boring (but interesting, both!), and totally dislike ""Shark Tales"", ""Planet 51"", ""Space Monkeys"", ""Surf's Up"", the first ""Madagascar"" (except for the penguins and the king lemur, lol).In a broader sense, my all time favourite animated movie (although not CGI) is ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"".Enough of that! With that very well established, let me give you my opinion of this movie.It is amazing! It is charming without being corny; hilarious without resorting to stupid pop-culture references; exciting without being overly loud.. and the best thing: it plays like a fable.It is absurd! ... but in a good way. The whole plan is to steal the moon, for crying out loud! How ridiculous could that be? And yet, we are led to root for the evil genius to be able to do just that. The whole thing is so tongue in cheek that you will pee in your pants laughing at the effects of having no moon for a few minutes (it is a quick flash of things, for they are so funny).The movie is incredibly intelligent. The jokes are dead on and VERY imaginative (for example - and this is not a spoiler - pay attention to how they manage to produce light when Dr. Gru and two of his minions are in a ventilation duct at Vector's fortress - just delightful).You will fall in love with his minions, and if you have a soft heart, with the three orphan girls.OH, I almost forgot!! The 3D... this is the best usage of 3D I've seen (excepting ""Avatar"", of course) in a movie. There is a roller coaster ride scene that will literally ""tickle your tummy"" (like my kids said). For the first three seconds it easily compares to the effects found in ""The Simpsons Ride"" at Universal Studios.The action sequences are thrillingly enhanced by the right amount of 3D, and make sure you STAY while the credits roll on. There are some OBVIOUS usage of 3D on those scenes with very funny results. Actually, here's a hint: sit down and enjoy these scenes while the people in the rows in front of you try to exit the theatre; the point of reference they offer will enhance the 3D in such a cool way that it will seem that they will bump into the staircase and the minions protruding from the screen (I suppose that was the intention of these bonus scenes, and boy they nailed it!) All in all, do yourself a favour and go WATCH it... I am sure I will do it again!Cheers!P.S. Be sure to learn a little, tiny bit of Spanish so you can ""get"" one of the jokes... my family was the only one laughing like crazies during that scene.. cheers again!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Fantastic animated movie for the entire family.,"Another awesome animated movie to hit us movie-lovers in 2010.""Despicable Me"" is a really nice movie, both in story and appearance. The movie is very colorful and superbly animated. There are so many little details going on in every scene, and it is just wonderful. I think it is great how far animation movies have reached by now. And there is somehow somewhat of a Tim Burton-feel to the way ""Despicable Me"" looks like, I mean the way the characters look and such. Not that the style here is dark or semi-Gothic, but they bear some resemblance.The story of ""Despicable Me"" is a warm story, of how the villain Gru's life gets turned upside down when he adopts Margo, Edith and Agnes for a scheme, but ends up thawing up his frozen heart. That is enough said about the movie plot, and it is all that need to be said actually. The story is fast paced and takes you on a roller-coaster of fun and excitement - and superb animation, of course. It is the type of story that will warm your heart and sink right in, probably one that you will have with you for quite some time actually.The impressive cast does a very, very good performance in their voice acting, and all characters have a lot of personality and quirky traits that you just want to see more and more of them. From the villainous Gru to the small yellow minions, you just simply love them all.I hadn't thought ""Despicable Me"" would turn out as cool as it was, so I was thoroughly surprised when I watched it. If you haven't already seen this phenomenal animated movie, get your butt in gear and do so. It is definitely one of the better animated movies of 2010. Universal Pictures actually nailed it right on the head with ""Despicable Me"". Thumbs up, way up!""Despicable Me"" can be enjoyed by adults and children alike. And it is a movie that should be on every movie collector's shelves.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
OK for young children,"Oh Dear! This is fine you children 8 and under. However, for anyone older the plot is highly predictable, the characterisation belaboured and most of the jokes purile in the extreme. Comparisons with similar recent offerings (UP, Toy Story 3, How to Tame your Dragon) are inevitable and DM does not compare well on any measure you care to use. Might be worth buying the DVD to keep young kids occupied for 90 minutes when it's raining, but there are far better animated films out there that will entertain you better and will be worth a second or third showing.Dadstheman",4.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Not an Animated Feature,"DESPICABLE ME is not an animated feature. It is a flat-out feature-length cartoon, a rare bird in the field, and the first really successful one since THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE. If anything, it's better.Animated features are typically fantasies, taking us to places and stories that cannot be filmed in live action. They can be dramatic, fantastic, inspirational, terrifying, all the range of emotions. Cartoons are different. Cartoons inhabit a universe that is a cross between Krazy Kat and the Keystone Kops. Walk off a cliff and you don't fall until you notice. Fall a thousand yards and hit the ground and you wheeze like an accordion until the next scene, when you're fine. Cartoons are silly.And this one is very very silly, from Steve Carell's indecisively Eastern European-voiced Grue to Julie's Andrews who, as his mom, sounds like Beaky Buzzard's mother in Bugs Bunny shorts, to the seemingly indistinguishable minions who talk like Chip and Dale on helium -- Grue knows all their names. A modern supervillain has to have people skills.The gags are all spot on in relevance and impeccably timed. The plot advances at a good clip and even the heartwarming aspects of the plot never descend into mawkishness -- the little girls whom Grue adopts to advance his plan to steal the Moon are endearing but frequently annoying.I saw the 3-D version and the question arises, should you spend the extra money to see it in 3-D? I don't think so -- but then I am happy looking at stuff in black and white and even silent films. You may get a little more out of the 3-D version, particularly the credit extras. But that's up to you. See it in whatever form you like, but see it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Hilarity and heart are a great mix for this Excellent movie!,"Despicable Me, the new animated from produced by Chris Melandandri, who also produced Ice Age: The Meltdown and Horton Hears A Who, is one of the summer's stand out movies. Steve Carell, Jason Segel, Miranda Cosgrove, and Russell Brand are perfect actors to lead this at times hilarious, at times tear jerking animated tale. Will Arnett, Kristen Wiig, Danny R. McBride, Julie Andrews and Jermain Clement make for a worthy supporting cast.Gru (voiced by Carell) is a evil genius who only wants to win the affection of his cold-hearted mother (voiced by Andrews), something he has NEVER had. His only friends are Dr. Nefario, a aging scientist (voiced by Brand), and his army of minions (voiced by directors Peiere Coffin and Chris Reneud, and Jermain Clement), Twinky like creatures with both one and two eyes, it varies.When a mysterious newcomer named Vector (voiced by Segal) steals the Great Pyrimid of Giza, Gru decides to pull off the greatest heist EVER: stealing the moon! Then, three orphan girls, Margo (voiced by Cosgrove), Edith, and Agnes (both voiced by newcomers who names I don't know.) The three of them don't hit it off with Gru instantly, but they see him as the first real parent they've ever had. Gru slowly begins to warm up to the girls, and they're interactions make for some truly heartfelt, and also hilarious moments. Case in point:Edith: Are these beds old bombs? Gru: Yes. But, they are very old and highly unlikely to blow up. Try not to toss and turn.Despicable Me pulls off something almost unheard of: a film that is enjoyable for both parents and children that does NOT involve humor centered around bodily functions, or violence.Final grade: A Plus infinite number of times!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Wild Ride!,"If Warner Brothers and Disney Animation Studios had ever had a baby they might have named it Illumination. The machine behind ""Despicable Me"" takes the wacky bits from old school cartoons and applies 21st century animation technology to produce a hip and well articulated masterpiece. From start to finish, the film was absolutely captivating and sophisticated with an engaging narrative and imaginative characters.All of the characters were well-voiced, but I found Jason Segal's ""Victor/Vector"" villain particularly inspired. The little yella fellas were uniformly charming and I expect they'll probably have their own aisle in toy stores very soon. Carell's crazy villainy was perfectly tuned, as was Julie Andrews whose new voice adds a delightful note as the Despicable mother. The juvenile vocals brought both sass and sweetness to the story, and Kristen Whiig was smarmy in a distinctly southern way.The humor is rich, with winks at classic cinema like ""Taxi Driver"", ""Apollo XIII"", and others. The Bank of Evil is staffed by former Lehman brothers execs, and recurring motifs and jokes create a comic continuity that is sustained through the credits. ""Dispicable Me"" was my second choice, but now I'm very happy was running a little late this evening.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Funny and cute but needless to say it's no Pixar,"In an attempt to pull off a job that gets him noticed in the world of criminal villains, Gru comes up against plucky young rival ""Vector"", who is very well equipped to say the least. In trying to steal a device from Vector, Gru adopts three young girls so that he can get robot cookies into Vector's lair. However, as successful as this is, he is still now legally parent to three girls – made all the more challenging by the fact that they are starting to grow on him, even if it is just a little bit.Years ago, I started writing down my thoughts on films in an attempt to try and put more thought into what I liked or didn't like about them; too often I would come out of the cinema and be asked what I thought only for me to say ""yeah, it was OK I guess"" and nothing more. So mostly now I try to have more to say than just that. Of course sometimes it is hard because the truth is that some films are just ""OK I guess"". Despicable Me is another of the animated films that Pixar have helped to create by virtue of their success and it is one such film because it will not stand for the ages and it isn't as strong as Pixar can do (the most obvious comparison is the much better The Incredibles) but it is still a perfectly fine little film that amused and pleased me while I watched it despite me being unlikely to ever have to watch it again.The story is a simple enough one in which a villain finds a heart through three small children, it was always going to happen but I guess this is part of watching the film. Fortunately within this plot there is plenty that is funny, cute or cute and funny. Although it feels a little like ideas from other places, the project is still quite clever with good comic timing and imaginative touches that generally made me laugh. Plus I am a sucker for the cute – the little yellow creatures were a hoot and the three children were a constant delight to me with ""It's so fluffy"" being my favourite line of the film by about a million miles. This charm carried it for me because otherwise it isn't quite as smart or as cleverly funny as I would have liked – the adult jokes in particular tended to feel more ""inserted"" than being part of the film in the way Pixar (sorry for mentioning them again) do so effortlessly.Carell's voice work is pretty good. At first I thought it was a shame he is sort of hidden behind that accent but actually he makes it work well. Those doing the kids voices also work very well – getting the levels right to be cute and funny – even those that dislike children will be won over by these three (which I guess is key to the story and the film when you think about it!). I didn't think Brand was well cast – his accent stands out too much and his character and his voice didn't match up for me in the way it did for others. The supporting voices have some good names but none of them really stood out or ever threatened to distract from Carell in the lead.As an adult, Despicable Me is ""pretty good"". It isn't brilliant and it tended to remind me of other films and other ideas but it has enough laughs, enough cute and enough charm to easily entertain. Children will love it and, while not Pixar (sorry!) adults will find themselves quite charmed by it as well.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Cute, charming and touching without being too cheesy","This is a CGI movie for kids and adults, where the plot is mainly from a villain's point of view.

All the little things that happen in the background is fun to watch as well and just about everything is played out very well.

Pretty Weak,"The problem with animated family fare is the bar is set very high by cable TV. There is a ton of great humorous animated shows out there--Penguins of Madagascar, Phineas and Ferb, Fairly Odd Parents, Dexter's Lab, Powerpuff Girls, SpongeBob...just to name a few. Additionally, Pixar can do no wrong. So when Hollywood invites America's families to drop $40 at the multiplex to watch a cartoon, they'd better bring it strong, and in my opinion, Despicable Me didn't deliver. Yes, it was mildly entertaining and the audience seemed to enjoy it, but overall it just kind of bored me. Like so many movies nowadays, it seems like we've already seen every funny bit in the previews. What bothered me the most however is absolutely EVERYTHING in this movie seems to be derived from something else or is a cheap imitation. Dr Gru talks like the kid from Dexters Lab and looks like Monty Burns. His nemesis looks like Dexter's nemesis Mandark. The minions all sound like Wall-E. So bottom line, you and your family won't storm out of the theater and demand your money back, but you would probably find more innovative animated humor at home on your TV.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A modern classic,"I don't know how I would have reacted to Despicable Me if I'd seen it when I was a child, but as an adult, I found it hilarious. Hopefully the kids in the audience just adore the gibberish spoken by the little yellow minions and don't pay attention to the ""mean humor"" that is so popular in modern culture. Yes, it is a caricature of ""root for the villain"" - the lead character is literally a villain who enjoys committing world-scale crimes - but let's hope not too many people take to heart the jokes that involve popping someone's balloon and ruining an ice cream cone.For grown-ups, it's a perfect comedy. We're old enough not to make Gru a role model, so we can laugh harmlessly at his bad behavior. The three kids he adopts are sweet even when they're snotty, and the rival villain is too idiotic for words. The silly, simple humor is guaranteed to put a smile on your face no matter how bad a day you've had - which is why it's perfect for exhausted parents to watch with their children. Endlessly quotable, this sweet movie is practically a modern classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Despicable Me: Cute but nothing more.,"I am simply baffled by the amount of (over-the-top) praise this film has received! It is ludicrous!

(Make sure you stay during the credits in order to be blown away!)The film orbits around Gru, the 2nd greatest criminal in the world, who wants to perform the crime of the century; steal the moon! He is helped by his loyal legion of (VERY adorable) minions who are the main generators of laughs through-out the film! The film-maker found a brilliant way to make the audience fall for the evil master-mind; imposing upon him the task of taking care of the 3 orphans.Some jokes are a big success, while others are tired out gags that fall flat on their faces. Their isn't much focus on plot here, but , let's cut tot the chase, the only people who know how to mix plot with great emotional core is Pixar! (It goes without saying, anyways). In other words, don't walk into the theater expecting a masterpiece.)Several people have enjoyed this film - including me- but I didn't find anything here worth of excessive praise. A kid sitting next to me kept on jumping in his seat,laughing hysterically; he truly enjoyed it and was captivated by it. I, perhaps, enjoyed watching the film succeed in making kids laugh rather than watching the film itself...",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Good...(not brilliant)...but very good :D,"I love the concept of this film, how the viewpoint is of the villain and that conflict and battle of the egos' for the best villain title. But i think the film really kicked in when we are introduced to the cutest little orphan girls: Margo, Edith and Agnes (Agnes being the youngest and cutest) I loved the character development of Gru, who turns from failed villain to loving father and big softie. But sadly this film kept being interrupted by silly characters such as Vector (who just simply wasn't funny) and Dr. Nefario who was just a British idiot. But then when we are brought back to Gru's storyline which simply make the film what it is. So it did feel inconsistent, the storyline of Gru and the little kids is the best and i guess you can cope with the in between bits. Of course it's not as good as a PIXAR animation: because it didn't have that emotional depth as PIXAR does (it was emotional and sweet but thats it, nothing more) and a PIXAR film feels right and feels so nurtured by a group of enthusiastic artists and animators but this felt like just a good film. But putting that aside this is no doubt an enjoyable film, of course the little minions were cute, and there was some great character development in this film so i would say it's a good watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Heart warming Fun,"I was pretty surprised by the quality of this film. As usual, the animation was stunning, but I digress. What kids' flick isn't on par with the animation now-a-days, aside maybe the few nobodys that no one ever cares for. Disney and Dreamworks are no longer the only real competition. The emotion in the film is definitely its strongest suit, for you'll probably find yourself very touched by these characters by the end of the movie. This makes up for the rather simple story actually, one you probably have seen in some cartoon show somewhere.The voice acting was pretty on spot, with Steve Carell Russel Brand, and Jason Segal. And for the record this is probably the only production starring Miranda Cosgrove that I actually respect. The only other I have to knit pick about is perhaps the score; not the most stunning I've ever heard, but it holds my attention rather well. So definitely check this film out, because it's worth it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Must see,"This was a fantastic movie. My son and I loved it. We saw the 2d version and i'm curious as to how good the 3D version is since there were many scenes that would have been ideal for 3D. I recommend that you also watch the end credits, especially if you're viewing the 3D version. Gru isn't a very outgoing person as far as showing affection but as you watch the movie you will understand as to why he is this way. The hyperness of the little girls is pretty accurate as any parent will testify too. There is a scene at the amusement park involving a stuffed unicorn that many parents can probably relate to and wish that they could have delt with it in the same was that Gru did. I would recommend this movie for everyone to see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Despicable Me is a wonderfully enjoyable yet totally forgettable animated feature from Universal Pictures.,"Despicable Me is a wonderfully enjoyable yet totally forgettable animated feature from Universal Pictures that follows an eerie criminal mastermind as he works to become the greatest, most despicable villain in the world. The film, starring the voice of Steve Carell as Gru, a criminal intent on executing the largest heist in the history of the world, is often funny, always entertaining, but unfortunately much more forgettable than the animated films it goes against (see Toy Story 3 and How to Train Your Dragon). Regardless, for young kids or an adult audience alike, it provides enough wonderful visuals and comedy to keep you fully competent for it's fast paced 95-minute run time.Despicable Me opens and ends with Gru, an awkward individual dressed in all black with a pointy nose, bald head, skinny legs, and fat body. He, much like the other characters in the film, features characteristics that we don't often see in animated features. No one necessarily looks human, but in the age when apparently we're able to build shrink rays, spaceships, and squid launchers, who knows what mankind will look in the making.When Gru meets Vector, the criminal most famous for stealing a pyramid in Egypt, the film immediately becomes a competition of criminal minds, a battle for the bigger idea, and a race to outwit the other individual. It's only when Gru adopts three young girls, originally planned as bait to outwit is sympathetic suitor, that the film goes from funny and action oriented to sappy and heartwarming.There's absolutely nothing bad about Despicable Me from a film-making standpoint. I was very much impressed by the visuals, the design, and the overall flow of the script. I guess the reason the film was somewhat forgettable for me, is the fact that it was such a lighthearted piece of entertainment, with characters that exited my head just as easy as they entered into it. With films like Toy Story 3, we're brought back to our childhood with toys, muppets, and mascots that we remember from our yesteryears. With How to Train Your Dragon, we're transferred into a world of magical, mystical dragons. With Despicable Me, we're still in the States, but the inventions we're capable of coming up with are just a bit more complex.Overall, I recommend Despicable Me for what it is, a lighthearted, funny, fantastic looking animated feature. Is it the best animated feature I've seen? No. But in the age of the Alpha & Omega's and the Alvin and the Chipmunks, trust me, you could do a whole lot worse.Michael Buffa Editor, Popcorn Jury http://www.popcornjury.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Despicable waste of money!,"WHAT A WASTE OF TIME, TALENT, AND MONEY!How in the world is this really, really lame movie getting such good reviews?1. Boring, old, and overused story line.2. Saturday morning cartoon like plot and animation.3. Really bad voice overs (come on.. can't we do a better join of reading from the script into a microphone? how about a little emotion, voice inflection, or originality?).4. Reuse of characters (the villain looks exactly like a character used in ""The Incredibles"" and the middle aged girl looks like the boy at the beginning of ""Up"").5. Compared to ""Toy Story 3"" and ""Shrek"" this summer animation is a way, way distant 3rd place (not even close).6. (and this is the worst) This movie is really just NOT all that funny. In fact, if it wasn't for the site gags by the minions the number of time the audience laughed for this movie in the theater I was in (an almost full Cinemark 3D Xtreme theater) could be counted on one hand!So.. ignore all the planted and unrealistically high reviews in here created by paid reviewers (I just love those giving a rating of 9 or 10 to this piece of junk and claiming that they are a real reviewer and not paid off), save your hard earned money, and rent it on DVD for a dollar or two when it comes out around Thanksgiving (if not sooner).I feel really ripped off by this one....",3.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Anything but despicable!,"An animated feature that is not from Pixar, but is still really good? Yes it can happen! Despicable me might not have the values and depth of the movie ""Up"" or other Pixar movies, but on entertainment value alone this does not have to hide behind any other movie. I was a bit skeptical, but the movie really got to me.Steve Carrell is adorable rather than frightening. And he does manage to walk the line between being cruel and a bit mean, but also still a nice and warm character. Kudos for writing him like that, but also for his voice performance (he does have an accent you see, one of his specialties apparently).You might have seen quite a few scenes in the trailer, but there is still quite a few things to discover in the movie itself. Fun and light, but still with a few punches here and there. Sweet and sour so to speak. Open yourself up to the movie and you will relish the experience!",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Great Movie! LOVE 3d,"I was fortunate to get free tickets to see this movie in 3d over the weekend. I only went because it was free, I really was not excited, but it ended up surprising me and I really enjoyed it. The people I saw the movie with were from ages 6 to 31, male and female, and we ALL thought the movie was great!!There was a lot of lol moments, the theatre was packed, and everyone in the audience seemed to enjoy themselves. The story was cute and enjoyable for children as well as adults. It had a good message too, which makes it worth your time to go see. I loved watching this film in 3d! I think the movie would be good without 3d, but if you are going to spend the money to watch it, spend the 3 extra dollars and see it in 3d. It was worth it.This film is AWESOME and I would recommend it to everyone!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"irresistibly cute and clever on a silly cartoon level and a few dark edges, no more no less","Sometimes a movie can just aim to be adorable fun, and Despicable Me is nothing else if not that. The film features a hook-nosed villain named Gru who has a bunch of little yellow pill-shaped minions all with one eye and speak gibberish and who adopts a few cute little orphans so he can infiltrate the lair of a nerdy would-be villain named Victor (or ""Vector"" as he tries to call himself), and who ultimately loves the little rascally girls who just want the big guy to take care of them. It's like a fluffy little dark comedy, if that can possibly be combined, where the movies doesn't lose its edge entirely, but over the course of the story it gets fluffier, a little more heartfelt. But, thankfully, it's always funny.Maybe it's funny in that silly old-style cartoon way where we see characters who are no good doing crazy things like trying to scale the walls of other no-goodniks. Or, as it really is, it's like one of those cartoons on the Cartoon Network only extended feature-length (think, perhaps, Dexter's Laboratory, which had a character wanting nothing but to be an evil mad-scientist and usually did pretty poorly at it; Gru as Dexter's bald uncle). Others out there may also think back to Lemony Snickett, which also featured a curmudgeon who becomes the ward of some kids and the kids start to get the better of him. This isn't Lemony Snicket, however, nor exactly Dexter's Lab or other cartoons. It's entirely familiar, but its original in its details.The movie is aimed at children for a large part, but it also has a lot of jokes and just a general attitude at times for the adults. Gru early on is a Grinch-like character (there's an obvious connection to Seuss stories, a Lorax t-shirt seen included), and has a lot of mean-spirited quips at people or little tricks like a freeze-gun that are just delightful to watch. It's fun to see a character be as bad as he wants to be, and at the same time isn't very good at it - and, too, neither is his exercise-suit wearing nemesis, Victor. But it's pretty clear once those little yellow minions come into the fore-front, as do those little girls (especially the really small one with the love for her unicorn and bedtime stories about kittens) that it's a cute-fest. You want to hug this movie once you give in to it.And whether or not you give in to it will probably determine how much you respond to it. It's a treat for kids, who will want the high- spirited comedy and the progression of the story of Gru becoming more and more likable (unlike the total grime of Lemony Snickett's character). For adults, the story will be familiar, especially if one's taken their kids to see something like it recently. Everything is done in good fun, and even the ending with its Bee Gees music playing during a dance recital is meant to give everyone a big smile. It's a minor treat following Toy Story 3, and a welcome respite from the likes of The Last Airbender as entertainments for the ""family"" this summer. Oh, and Steve Carrell is great by the way as Gru.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Fantastic,"This is one of the very greatest of modern animation, real fun to watch for any age group. We have watched this many times now, and never get tired of it, and there always seems to be something in the movie that we never spotted before. Great for family viewing, or just a fun afternoon in. It contains some ""life lessons"", but it is not in your face stuff, just a mild nudge to be nice to everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
cute family film!,"Surprisingly, there seems to be a lot of PG rated films lately - which is nice for families.We saw the previews in 3D and it looked like a cute film.Which it was.Just don't go comparing it to anything by Pixar, but it has heart and humor.Won't bother to repeat the story.. But it was nice to see Love as the central message of a movie.Love of a mother for a son, a son for his mother, children for their dad.And the minions love for ..um.. Grul.The message is that we sometimes lose track of what is important to us (family) when success gets in the way. And that wanting to please other people (Grul wanting to please his mother) stops us from being whom we were meant to be.The minions were cute, but felt they could have been used more...The cast was very good, and while the animation is not up to Pixar quality, the film was always watchable.Ironically, my theater could only get the 2D version. Somehow, I think this would have been more fun in 3D.Fun for the whole family - though there is one scene that looks like blood that could scare very young children.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
What a Delightful Surprise!,"This is an animated effort with great characters, lots of action, and some really touching moments. I had heard so much about it and was set for disappointment. I actually believe that they actually used restraint in the portrayal. Along with ""Up"" from a previous year, I've regained some of my admiration for animators (should have thrown in Toy Story 3 as well). It is so nice not to have to deal with the lowest common denominator. I actually began to care about people who weren't really people. The plot is complex and interesting and there is one of my favorite themes: redemption. Like ""Up,"" we get to see why the character is the way he is. Human history--wonderful. What I like is that children will watch this and should be moved. No flatulence, no butt jokes, just really nice interaction. Also, the female characters are truly wonderful.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
More of a children's film than a family feature,"I consider a family film geared towards an audience of all ages (ie Toy Story, Dragon) and I think children's films like Nanny McPhee and CareBears the Movie do nothing but entertain the youngsters while we older folk sit and watch mindlessly - but perhaps chuckle occasionally. That is what Despicable Me is: a children's film. I loved the previews and thought it would be hysterical (It's Steve Carell!) but I was disappointed. Ever since the first preview with the pyramids, I expected greatness. Not so. But it was not bad. Just... okay. It's decent. There are funny bits as the minions do nothing but slapstick, saving the day in the process... And the cute little girl everyone is raving about? Slightly annoying at times. She's is THAT kind of cute. I kinda liked Edith who had a flair of dark comedy in her. It is worth a matinée ticket.

Pretty entertaining.  But it was missing that WOW! factor.,"How can any other movie company possibly compete with PIXAR and Dreamworks in the animation department? Well, you either get really lucky to get your film funded....or, you get a studio like Universal to shell you out a couple million. And that's exactly what they did with this movie. I like to see something fresh and new in the animation department......well, you always seem to get that with PIXAR, but not so much with Dreamworks. Hopefully this will add a new level of competition in the realm of animation.Well, i was kind of hoping that this movie would offer something a little different, but instead, it came off just like a mediocre Dreamworks picture. In fact, i actually forgot that this was produced by Universal, and assumed it was a Dreamworks Animation project. Don't get me wrong, the movie kept my attention and was mildly entertaining.........but much like Dreamworks movies, this movie failed in the second act. You know how some animated movies tend to get a little dull and boring in the middle.....yeah, that somewhat happened with this.Also, the humor was in little doses, and at times, it seemed like they were begging for your laughs. Yes there were some sequences that had you lightly chuckling to yourself, but after a while, the jokes fall a little flat. Yeah the story is a little on the cute side, which is alright with me......but it's emotional level isn't as high as say....PIXAR? Okay, I'm sorry for using so many comparisons to other animation companies. But it's kind of hard not to, when you basically have only 3. So your easily going to compare and contrast.Bottom Line, yeah, it's pretty entertaining, and has you laughing just a little bit. But it wasn't as good as i was hoping it would be. The kids will love it, maybe even some parents. But it certainly doesn't have that WOW! factor we all expect when we see an animated feature.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Eh... yawn...,"This movie had potential to be a great film. The idea of a villain taking care of three little girls, surrounded by bug-eyed minions, while trying to steal the moon, seemed like it would be worth a few laughs. Sadly, it wasn't.What's with all the praises?Most of the scenes were only to show of the 3D, so the overall film was bland. Any time the movie came close to conveying real emotion or care for the characters it jumped to a new scene. It was disappointing, I wanted to care about the characters, but couldn't. I was excited when they began to show Gru's back story, but all we got were snippets, nothing substantial that fully explained his relationship with his mother, his notions of parenting, or turn to villainy. His fascination with the moon was barely touched upon, and could have helped support the film. Giving Gru some ray guns, gray clothes, and thick accent does not make him a villain, unless we know why he became a villain in the first place.The movie was overall bland. The jokes fell flat. Perhaps little children who have yet to develop a sense of humor beyond burps and farts enjoyed it.The voice work of Steve Carell was great, but the random addition of Julie Andrews, who in my opinion is a great voice talent, was a pointless waste of talent, seeing as how she couldn't have had more than three lines.I will say one thing positive about this film, I really enjoyed the music.",3.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Not Despicable Nor Evil, But Fluffy","If you are a fan of animated movies, then this year is one of the best years of your life. ""Despicable Me"" is a movie that you can watch all over again without getting tired of it. It has many laughs, and memorable characters.

This is just a perfect animated film,"It has something for the whole family, and there is no wasted space in it.

When Gru sees Vector's weakness for cookies, he figures his ticket into Vector's well armed castle to steal back a needed weapon are the three little orphan girls who sold him the cookies in the first place when they come back to deliver the cookies. So he has to adopt them in a hurry.You can pretty much tell how this is going to play out from the beginning. Gru is not THAT bad of a bad guy. In fact, well placed flashbacks show it was negligent parenting by his mom that likely made him want to do big showy things in the first place. How bad could he be if he is taking care of dismissive mom in her old age?So many of the characters are stereotypical - Vector the nerd villain, the evil morbidly obese banker, the older scientist working with Gru who gets confused about what kind of invention he is supposed to be building, and the three little girls who act delightfully on key for their ages.The fun is in all of the one liners, the character development, and the minions.

"""Despicable"" mostly for kids","Right in the center of a normal neighborhood, in normal suburbia, sits  an odd house with a dried out lawn and large spires. Inside is the  secret lair of an ambitious super villain Gru (Steve Carell) and his  army of mischievous minions.  Gru is wallowing in the shadow of a highly publicized heist completed  by a competing super villain named Vector (Jason Segal), so Gru  attempts to raise his game.  Along the way, Gru crosses paths with three orphaned girls who view him  not as a villain, not as cold or uncaring but most importantly, not as  a failure. The orphans see Gru as their savior from the orphanage.  The three girls (Margo, Edith and Agnes) are the key to Gru's  transformation, his master plan and the overall plot of this Universal  answer to ""Shrek 4″ and ""Toy Story 3″ Unfortunately, they are not in  the same class.  First, there is no reason for this to be in 3-D as it offers nothing to  improve the story. The animation as several flaws, dark shadows drag  lines and poorly portrays the emotions of its characters compared to  Pixar's Woody and pals.  Second, this is a child's film first and foremost. There are plenty of  laughs, especially from the minions, but your kids are going to enjoy  this film much more than you.  There are plenty of big names offering their voices: Russell Brand as  Dr. Nefario, Julie Andrews as Gru's Mom and Miranda Cosgrove (iCarly)  is Margo. It was only Steve Carell's Gru that stood out.  Sierra, age 11 said: ""It was great to see a story from the villain's  point of view."" My eight-year-old didn't have a bad thing to say ""I  liked all of it"" and the 5-year-old from our group (not a Jones) loved  it so much that she thought she could go see it again. The teenage son  was much more critical of the animation and was moderate in his praise.  I concur.  ""Despicable Me"" is a good film, not a great one even though it's great  to their target audience:10-year-olds and younger. There are a ton of  great gags, funny lines, but the story is predictable and derivative  lacking the depth and meatiness that audiences have found in the Pixar  films. The trailers have ruined a couple of the better moments, which  is always frustrating. Most important is that the parenting theme is  inferior to great films like ""Up"" or ""Finding Nemo"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Oh Yeah !!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Loved the Touching Parts More,"I watched the 2D version of ""Despicable Me"" with my kids this afternoon. The trailers were not really very good or enticing for me to be excited about it. It was honestly quite a mixed bag for me.The story involved a super villain named Gru whose status was threatened by a nerdy upstart named Vector, who upped the evil ante by stealing the Great Pyramid of Egypt. (Is it my imagination or is Vector a dig at Bill Gates?) Anyway, to top that heist, Gru plots on stealing the Moon itself. To do that, Gru saw the need to adopt three orphan girls, named Margo, Edith and Agnes, in order to infiltrate Vector's lair. Initially, harsh and compassion-less towards the children, Gru eventually warms up and ends up actually caring for the kids. But can his love for the kids triumph over his obsession to be the top villain in the world?The initial scenes building up the story was too slow for me. In fact my wife and I both confessed to have dozed off in these parts. However, for me the fun and action begins when Gru went to adopt the girls. I liked the movie the most when it showed heart, and the developing love and sense of fatherhood of Gru towards the kids. Those two bedtime story reading scenes were the highlights of the whole film for me. The whole rivalry thing with Vector was not too good for me, mostly owing to the ""blah"" way Vector was rendered and written.The comedy could be too rude (like how Gru acted during his interview with Ms. Hattie of the orphanage), or even gruesome (like red stuff coming out of a spiked box when a girl gets caught inside). However, when the movie tones down its hyperactivity and cranks up the human drama, I can't help but be very much touched by these scenes. Gru's scenes with Little Agnes (who positively loved fluffy unicorns!) were all executed to tear-jerking perfection.The voice acting by Steve Carrell was also instrumental for us to actually root for Gru despite his initial villainy. I was very surprised to see at the end that it was no less than Ms. Julie Andrews who voiced the funny character of Gru's mother. The voices of the three girls, especially the very cute Agnes, were very well rendered. The yellow blob-like Minions of Gru were also portrayed very cutely (but what are they, really?).Compared to the excellent animated films so far seen this year, which included ""Toy Story 3"" and ""How to Train Your Dragon,"" ""Despicable Me"" falls behind in my opinion. The start may be quite annoying and uninteresting, however investing more time to watch will make this rather brash comedy prove to be a most heart-warming adventure instead.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Fun for all,"Went to see this with my partner and not really knowing much about it I was just hoping for a reasonably entertaining experience. On entering the cinema we were presented with 3d glasses and a free bag of popcorn (nice touch), this was a screener so probably a one off and not to be expected again.The place was packed with kids and I must admit I did have some misgivings at first but once the film started I realized how wrong I was , this is the kind of film that must be watched whilst surrounded by hordes of laughing children.The animation was very well done and so was the story line, the jokes were easily understood by all and overall the humor was fit for all ages, the 3D effects in most films usually rely on objects appearing to fly out of the screen directly at you but it was more subtle in this movie, which I find more appealing.I would recommend this film to anyone, with or without kids, it has great appeal to all ages, and stay through the end credits.And on a final note for anyone who like me is sure that the main character ""GRU"" is familiar think back to the old comics ""Wham"" and ""smash"", remember Grimly Feendish.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
It's so cute you might die,"Despicable Me is the latest animated film in what appears to be an endless assault of 3D cinema. Luckily for us this movie actually does a fairly decent job of utilizing the 3D technology in creating a pleasant looking and functional 3D landscape. Here we follow a master villain named Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) who aims to become the worlds most notorious super villain. Along with the help of Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) and a host of little, yellow creatures known as the ""minions"" (though Gru knows each one by name), Gru finally gets his shot when he attempts to steal the moon. The only problem is he doesn't have the weapon needed or the money. Not to mention he is being out-hustled by Vector (Jason Segel), a young, upstart of a villain with more money and one big heist already under his belt.In order for his plan to succeed, Gru requires the help of three orphan girls, which he adopts, and misleads them into helping his evil cause. What appears to be a simple plan turns out to be disaster and ultimately leads to Gru connecting with the girls and distracting him from his master plan.There's a point during this movie where I just gave up analyzing the story and how it makes sense and just sat there and watched, taking each joke one line at a time and then moving on to the next one. It kind of worked. The story and the logic doesn't really matter, like where the minions come from, why Gru became a villain, or why he doesn't try to go after something easier.The crowd favorite was without a doubt Agnes, the youngest of the orphan girls that Gru adopts. She looks like a bobble head doll with puppy dog eyes and an obsession with unicorns. She is the punchline in just about every scene she is in, but that works. As far as moving the story along, she does nothing to that effect. To be quite honest there really only needs to be one girl, but having three personalities gives us some variety. Even though there could probably be a solution that doesn't involve using the girls, it is necessary for the girls to try and change Gru into a better person.In regard to the voice acting, this is a pretty solid performance all around. Carell does a pretty decent job while the others almost go out of their way to not sound like their real selves, which is refreshing. Unlike Dreamworks films which is basically just hiring big name stars to talk into a microphone with some feeling, just some. Brand does a nice job as well as Segel, but I was very surprised to see others like Will Arnett, Kristin Wiig, and out of left field...Julie Andrews! All of which did a sufficient job.After looking past overwhelming cutesy nature of the film, this is actually a pretty well made film. I would absolutely recommend seeing this in 3D. The 3D isn't as fluid as Avatar, but nothing will be for a while (except maybe Toy Story 3, but that's a different story entirely). The characters are so disproportionate in all physical areas, which can be amusing, but after a while you don't even notice. The big winner here is the depth. I feel like every time I talk about 3D movies this is my number one concern, but it helps so much. It makes an average scene look great and a great scene look spectacular. There are examples of both in this film. Some parts had hints of genius, only to be followed by a slap of cuteness that almost ruins the moment. Almost.This is just a fun film that kids and adults can go see together and not sit in agony. I would fork up the money for the 3D if you can to really give you the full experience (especially during the end credits).

A Chuckle-Delivery Vehicle That Performs Up to Design Specs,"Despicable Me (1:35, PG) — Other: Comedy; 2nd string; originalYou remember those little green 3-eyed space aliens who came out of the pay-a-quarter grabber box in Toy Story? Well, Despicable Me comes up with a legion of similarly whimsical scene-stealers: the minions, little yellow guys shaped like time-release capsules, all of whom wear goggles over either 1 or 2 eyes and scurry cheerfully and endlessly (if not always effectively) to do the bidding of their master Gru (Steve Carell), the World's Greatest Villain, or his hench-mad-scientist Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand).The WGV title is visually underlined by driving the biggest polluter since Mount Pinatubo but apparently determined solely by which world landmarks one has recently stolen. This dubious distinction seems to be slipping out of Gru's grasp, as most recently the Great Pyramid of Giza has been pilfered by upstart Vector (Jason Segel), a nebbishy young guy in a jumpsuit which — like everything he owns — is embellished with a giant letter ""V"". Gru determines to top this feat by upping the ante and stealing  the Moon!To do this, however, he needs financing, so he returns to the place which has always backed his fiendish endeavors in the past, the Bank of Evil and its pompous but imposing director, Mr. Perkins (Will Arnett). Unbeknownst to Gru, however, Perkins is Vector's father and is secretly rigging the game so that his boy will prevail in the end.The oi in the flyntment comes in the most innocuous form, as 3 little orphans from Miss Hattie's School for Girls — responsible oldest sister Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Geier), and unicornphile Agnes (Elsie Fisher) — appear at Vector's front door selling cookies. Vector effusively welcomes them (since he just loves coconutties), and Gru, hiding in the bushes doing recon, hatches a scheme to infiltrate his rival's headquarters. He adopts the girls, then sneaks robot cookies into the order his new wards deliver to Vector.At this point, true to his villainous nature, he figures the girls have outlived their usefulness and tries to get rid of them. But they're really adorable, and they inveigle him into a carnival where he becomes incensed at one of the rigged games; grossly overreacts; wins the big stuffed animal for the little girls; earns their admiration, gratitude, hugs, and devotion; and loses his heart. He soon finds himself dithering over competing entries for May 26 in his appointment calendar: Swan Lake (the girls are taking ballet) or Steal the Moon.Meanwhile, Nefario grows increasingly exasperated at his boss's loss of focus. His own reputation is on the line, too. Unfortunately, his hearing is starting to fail him, and he's been turning out noogie robots and fart guns instead of cookie robots and dart guns. And the whole movie is like that, basically a joke a minute, almost all of them winners.This is an immensely good-natured film, with a plethora of visual gags and the occasional bone tossed to the adults (like the subtitle ""formerly Lehman Brothers"" under the Bank of Evil logo).Despicable Me is also completely shallow. Everything is on the surface. There's not even as much character development as in, say, How To Train Your Dragon (another animated kid flick that had a more serious bent to it). But it never pretends to more. It's a chuckle-delivery vehicle, and it performs completely up to its design specs.My only serious complaint was that Hans Zimmer's score featured too much loud, pervasive drum banging in the early going, but fortunately he stopped after awhile.Story by Sergio Pablos, screenplay by Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul, direction by Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud.

An entertaining animated film,"Gru(Steve Carell) is the most popular super villain out there, he looks like a cross between Lex Luther and Dr. Evil. He is at the top of his game, is planing is biggest heist to date, to steel a shrink ray, and get funding to build a rocket, fly into space, and shrink the moon, and steel it. With the help of his little yellow minions. But his plans quickly go awry, when another super villain wanna be named Vector(Jason Segel) steels the shrink ray from him, and just as Gru is smart, but Vector proves to be one step ahead of him. But he soon finds out that Vector has a weakness for cookies, when he sees three orphan girls sell him cookies. Gru decides to adopt the three girls, in hopes the will help him steel the shrink ray back, but will the plan go through?The animation is almost up there with the shreks and the toy story's.

Light but original entertainment.,"""Despicable Me"" has what has become an almost unheard quantity in an age where sequels, prequels, reboots, TV to movie transfers, video game to movie transfers and children book to movie transfers -- originality. Unfortunately, it doesn't have much more than light entertainment value to go with the creativity. Steve Carell voices the hero-villain Gru with a Russian accent for reasons that seem related to perhaps Steve's feeling that he had to do something to earn all the money he was making for the voice work. There didn't seem to be anything in the plot that necessitated that Gru be Eastern European. Jason Segel voices Vector the villain-villain, a character who is nearly wholly uninteresting. The 3 children who eventually soften Gru's heart (oh, like you were unaware how this would end!) are cute but ultimately forgettable and actually a little whiny. Gru's allergy pill-shaped minions are not that cute either and also a little whiny. Like Gru's accent no explanation is offered as to just what the hell they are supposed to be. The movie tilts a little at trying to be more than just a summer popcorn movie by given some insight into Gru's mother's lack of sympathy but the backstory would have made much more sense if she was the father instead. There is also some hinting at larger issues with Gru representing old-fashioned Victorian-house owning villainy and Vector representing sleek, modern space pod-house villainy but it never really goes anywhere. There are some laughs particularly a sign underneath the one announcing ""The Bank of Evil"" where Gru tries to get a loan indicating that it used to be called ""Lehman Brothers"" but they generally of the slight smile and giggle variety. In short, if there is a heat wave near you and you have kids this is a reasonable way to get come air-conditioning and darkness time in.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

"Despicable Me (2010, PG)","For kids, Gru is an outlandish villain. More importantly, he has a fun and whimsy minion of little, yellow servants, perhaps another robotic creation of Gru's associate, Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand), or a cartoon species of some sort. They look like Twinkies with human features (little arms, little legs, huge eyes) and they wear worker outfits (protective glasses, blue overalls, work gloves). They mostly act like kids, but they are obedient to their boss, Gru.Gru shows all the signs of losing his touch. He was once a despicable villain, but now he's mostly grouchy and unsuccessful. He reacts negatively against things that annoy old people: he uses his freeze gun on other customers to get around waiting in lines, he threatens his neighbor about a dog dirtying the lawn, and he warns three little girls to avoid making any annoying sounds. The ultimate death blow is his failure to go green (he drives in the worst pollution machine on the road) and his failure to conform (his lawn is dead and his house probably violates every local law in existence). Mix his old age rage and anti-green offenses with a bit of dark demeanor, antisocial attitude, and mean mom, and you get the basics of his villainy.In other words, he's not very despicable as advertised. He wasn't nearly as funny as one might expect from the trailers and title of the movie, but it doesn't ruin the movie in the least. It still has lots of little witty details, funny side characters, and cool gadgets. No one truly expects him to be bad in a kids movie anyway. No doubt his character will pull in an audience looking for a bad guy in the star position, but it wouldn't necessarily be any greater than if a well known, nice superhero was the star (which is a common misconception: just look at the popularity of Spider-Man or Superman).Far funnier is Gru's adversary, Vector. Gru wants to shrink and steal the moon to regain his position as the greatest of all villains. However, he can't deploy his plan because Vector (Jason Segel), a ridiculous, inventor villain, laughs his way to stealing the shrink gun. Vector is a geeky, rich kid who, when he isn't one upping Gru by stealing the pyramids, invents worthless weapons or sits around watching TV. Perhaps someday he would get around to stealing the moon for his own glory (and lucrative prospects). He's much more despicable than Gru, and Jason Segel (his voice) makes him sound something like Jon Lovitz, an egoistic loon. He certainly doesn't make intelligent plans. Vector's great accomplishment is to have better results copying Gru's tactics and thwarting Gru's plans.Gru is just the opposite. Dark, serious, devious, he's a hard working, constantly scheming villain from the suburbs who's had bad luck. Steve Carell voices him with a menacing accent that he reportedly takes from a mixture of Ricardo Montalban and Bela Lugosi. But the truest and most villainous characters in the entire movie are the evil, underground bankers (named Lehman Brothers) that refuse to fund Gru's moon ploy unless they see the shrinking gun in his possession.Being him, Gru devises another plan to take advantage of Vector's weakness for cookies. He adopts three girls from an orphanage to distract Vector and try to steal back his shrinking gun. This sets in motion a typical story of his reversal from insensitive to sensitive, dark to colorful (his spacesuit becomes pink after the girls mix in their clothes with his), or, as the tagline says, ""superbad to superdad"". Some of these sequences are enjoyable, especially with Gru putting out bowls of food for the kids, and having to read them a bedtime story about kittens.The youngest of the girls, Agnes (Elsie Fisher, voice), is the funniest of the girls. She fearlessly dominates the relationship over Gru and his vicious pet. She's particularly funny at an amusement park, which not only gives the audience an easy thrill for the roller coasters on the big screen but also allows Agnes to win a unicorn toy and joyously exclaim, ""it's so fluffy,"" with the amusement park game burning in destruction behind her.The various side characters around Gru were funniest. A few of the best jokes are at the expense of the little yellow minion sidekicks and Dr. Nefario, an old genius who has hearing problems (he mistakenly invents the wrong gadgets sometimes). The film also has its share of fun gadgets down in Gru's secret lab, including a NASA like mission control setup. It may disappoint some adults expecting a more humorous and evil villain, but it's very watchable, fun, and fast paced.The image quality of ""Despicable Me"" didn't seem negatively impacted by the 3D treatment. The 3D was more enjoyable and noticeable than in ""The Last Airbender"", but not so frequent that you get a huge advantage. The audience seemed to enjoy the film, but many of them had to stay for the credits since the yellow minion give a nice send off.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A Different Approach Than Pixar,"After pretty much working my way through all the Disney/Pixar animated films, ""Despicable Me"" was my first venture into Universal territory. The filmmaking styles are most definitely different, although I would argue that Pixar still holds a big edge.For a basic plot summary, ""Despicable Me"" tells the story of Dr. Gru (voiced by Steve Carell), a supervillian trying to stay on top of the supervillian world. While dueling with the young, up-and- coming supervillians, Dr. Gru gets involved with a trio of orphan girls who eventually lend him some basic humanity.Clearly, Universal utilizes a completely different formula than Pixar. Here, the animation is a little goofier and the action almost never ceases. A bit of emotion is still injected into the film, but nowhere near Pixar levels. In this case, the never-ending action gets a bit tiresome and the emotion is actually a bit too little, too late.Overall, however, ""Despicable Me"" will entertain all children with its fast pace, quirky humor, and abundance of sight gags. For folks any older, though, it just doesn't measure up to the Pixar stable of emotional depth and all-ages humor.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Simple Smiles,This movie was so hysterical! Laughs rocked the room at every scene played for humor. The voice-overs were amazing and so was the lipsynching. Most of the humor revolved around the minions and Gru. For more humor see the 3-D version and sit through the credits and you will laugh your head off. Another fun part about Despicable Me is actually seeing the challenges criminals face. This experience makes you feel a lot different about the actions Gru makes. After hearing the wonderful pros of Despicable Me you might want to Know why it's not a perfect ten. The reason is the plot. Although the movie is funny the plot keeps it from reaching it's full potential. The plot is very basic and could have been more developed.

7.8 at IMDb ... ? Wow.,"While I agree with the rating, I'm sure I got there via other means.

"Shrek meets The Pacifier, UNORIGINAL","This movie is so bland something had to be said, its no good, it relies on cheap plot devices to try and make the viewer feel emotionally attached to the characters. I can't find one ounce of originality in it. Cute innocent orphans (Annie, 101 Dalmations), a renegade who learns to love (Lilo and Stitch,), Minions who offer comic relief (Wily Wonka and the Chocolate Factory), its all been done before people. Like i said, the plot is basically The Pacifier meets Shrek. Like if they literally worked both plots in the same movie and changed the characters names. Only Shrek had good humor, where a lot of this movie's humor falls flat, i only laughed maybe once or twice at it. The physical humor will be funny to your kids, but the word of mouth jokes are odd and awkward. And i know its meant for little kids, but this movie looks like a TV movie i could watch on Nickelodeon. The animation is good but pretty unimpressive by todays standards.

Among the Strongest 2010 Animated Features,"Last Saturday, I managed to watch Despicable Me. Yeah I know that it isn't new for it was shown last year.I still decided to write a short review of it though I KNOW it's already late.Well it really moved me and I just wanna share some of my thoughts about it.I believe Despicable Me is among the best animated features of 2010. Yeah I know Toy Story 3 is great but this film definitely deserves a watch too.But before mentioning the good sides of the movie. Here's some weak areas from my observation.The story has some inconsistencies. Like when the kids were showed in their first sleep that they prayed first before sleeping but they were never showed praying again in the following sleep scenes.Vector was also a techy villain so I just can't figure out how he came up with the not-so-cool octopus gun invention, (I've read though that it was done purposely to come up with a scene close to a Jules Verne's novel).The presence of the minions was also kinda questionable for it isn't a monster or alien movie.However, considering the fact that it is a fun-filled animated feature, all those minimal errs are kinda excusable...hehe Now here are the strong points.I love this film for IT IS FULL OF LOVE.I love the characters in the movie too especially the very endearing Agnes. (She also reminds me of the lil girl from Monsters Inc.) The movie did not fail to show the right emotions. It was very accurate and very witty.In addition, the cinematography was nice, the sounds was just and the direction was splendid.One of the most remarkable scenes for me was the roller coaster ride which proves that great 3D rendering was done in the film. It kinda made me feel like I was in the ride too.I also love how the movie indirectly pointed out that we have let go of the bitterness in the past.This movie is definitely a good reminder that no matter how bad our past is we can still live a good life if we choose to.So as I end, I encourage everyone to watch the film if you haven't watch it yet.Very cute, funny and lovable. 8 out of 10 for me...",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Caught me by surprise,"Everything already said has been said. I caught this movie as a second choice today as what I wanted to see was not available. I was ""aware"" of DM but the marketing never intrigued me to make the effort to see it. Toy Story 3 and Inhception are my 2 favs so far but this gave it a good run for top 2. My vision doesn't allow me to adjust to 3D well and I almost left during the previews. Thank goodness I didn't. Once the feature started my vision adjusted and thought the beginning sequence was odd and intriguing. On the visit to the Bank of Evil and you see the former title of the bank name I thought to myself this just might be for me.As I giggled myself silly from scene to scene I caught myself thinking about just how funny some of the earlier scenes were and when it was quiet in the theater I was still giggling. The very odd character story line yet familiar looking characters blended well from scene to scene. The pleasant surprise reminds me of when I saw the original ""jackass"" movie. I had never seen the TV show and had a little familiarity with what it entailed. My son was too young to see it at the time and he was in another theater with his buddies watching something I had no interest in. ""Jackass"" is simply that in a nutshell, however something struck a chord with me and my screwed up youth. Very stupid, very funny, yet highly entertaining. There were times I couldn't catch my breath from the insanity and i feel that same way with DM. Worth every penny and a very worthy ""Blindside"".

Since i have a four year old sister I am always skeptical about what types of movies she watches, but after watching Despicable Me i can definitely see why adults also have an interest in animation. The best part was watching Him grow throughout the movie, going from villain to good guy. He seems very embarrassed to show the softer side of him and with that came humour. The minions I would say were his first children, as even though there are so many of them he knows each ones names.

Despicable Me nefariously uncovers endearment amongst the loveless.,"Villains, more often than not, are typically the most intriguing characters within a story. From super-powered megalomaniacs yearning to control the universe to fanatic psychotics keeping their idolised authors strapped to a bed. A well-executed villain's motive harmonises with the protagonists. Gru, a proud yet ageing villain, desires nothing more than to become the greatest super villain that had ever lived. His current nemesis, cookie-loving Vector, has stolen the Great Pyramid of Giza, so to better him Gru decides to utilise a shrink ray to minimise the moon and steal it. The Bank of Evil, his rivals and his own neglectful mother would then appreciate him as the malignant villain he wishes to become.Coffin and Renaud's family-friendly animation could easily have maintained this central plot thread to create nothing more than a goofy exercise in superfluous colour manipulation, particularly given Illumination's constant usage of vibrancy and fluidity. Instead, Paul and Daurio's screenplay introduces a plot device, well, three plot devices, that rapidly integrate with the central narrative to produce an entirely different direction. Margo, Edith and Agnes. Three orphaned girls that Gru agrees to adopt so that he can use their cookie-selling skills to infiltrate Vector's impregnable fortress and steal the shrink ray. This enables an abundance of character development for Gru, who gradually warms to the girls and confronts fathering duties. Children, once again, curing hearts enveloped my venomous poison, offering cuteness in all its fluffy unicorn wholesomeness. Despite Gru's abrupt character alterations when he takes the girls to an amusement park and suddenly realises he ""will never let go of them"", even though a second beforehand he was daydreaming about their abandonment, Despicable Me consistently remains solid throughout its heartfelt familial story that perpetuates the love adults have for their children.The script supplies plenty of witty lines of dialogue that allows Carell's exaggerated voice to provide boundless amounts of laughter with younger audiences. And if his talent doesn't work, Gru's minions sure will. Yellow, babbling, Tic Tacs equipped with dungarees and goggles. Some might describe them as cancerous, given their nonsensical behaviour and fatigued saturation over the years, however they function best in this feature. More often than not, they remain integrated to the story and less of a side distraction to ensure laughs through derivative slapstick humour. Are they still annoying to the point of wanting to commit genocide? Oh, absolutely. But tolerable nonetheless. Segel supplies buoyant energy voicing Vector, with viral lines such as ""curse you teeny tiny toilet"", whilst equipped with clinically designed technology juxtaposing Gru's handmade approach. Brand as sidekick Dr. Nefario was forgettable to say the least, eclipsed by his co-stars.Then comes the soundtrack, infamously associated with Pharrell Williams. Less annoying than his theme song in the sequel (I despise ""Happy"" with an almighty passion), the tracks he provides have a calmer tempo and suit the scenes they accompany, ""Fun, Fun, Fun"" in particular. Concluding on a dance-a-thon to a classic song, this time The Bee Gees' ""You Should Be Dancing"", is all too reminiscent to a far more superior animated feature 'Shrek 2'.Alas, Despicable Me remains the best of the franchise and the best feature Illumination Entertainment have produced. So sweet and fluffy that one could ""die"". Regardless of the franchise motif minions (that spin-off was inevitable...) and the rushed character development, this family animation boasts colourful visuals and a heartfelt narrative that almost competes with Pixar's and DreamWorks' weaker features. Almost. Anyway, ""IT'S SO FLUFFY!"".",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Steve Carell and Russell Brand do a great job voicing the bad, Gru and his henchman (although it was ponied out to me at the start that the terrible Gru wasn't all bad). The animation is top notch and if i didn't find the baby like antics of the Minions particularly amusing, I could see their charm and enjoy the main protagonists falling over themselves to achieve their aims.

The world's greatest villain has just met his greatest challenge: three little girls named Margo, Edith and Agnes. (Universal Pictures)DESPICABLE ME is a film that reminds us that it's okay to have an animated film that can be watched as nothing more than entertainment. It doesn't have the heavy handed themes of death and moving on like in TOY STORY 3 nor is it profound and enlightening like many Pixar films are. But that doesn't make the film bad. It's just light-hearted entertainment for the whole family to enjoy. When is that ever a crime?The film sports an *gasp* original premise and succeeds mostly due to Ken Daurio's clever and comedic script. The characters are also very lovable. Steve Carell is excellent as Gru, the main character. He provides an excellent Russian accent and gives the character a big heart. Still, I felt that they could have done more with Jason Segel, Russell Brand, and especially Kristen Wiig. These actors are comedic gold and their characters ended up to be more underwhelming than hilarious. However, the minions stole the show, providing some of the film's biggest laughs.

It's used in both the gimmicky and subtle way, which I thought helped the film. Overall, it's nowhere near as good as TOY STORY 3 and HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON, both brilliant films. However, it's a really sweet film that just melts your heart. Parents should really take their kids to see it because you could do a lot worse.

Funny in its own charming way!,"This movie is one of my favorites of all time, even though I'm only 13 years old (I love movies; I watch at least a new one every day during the summer! Don't try that at home.). Some of the jokes are a bit childish, but I found myself laughing at those the hardest. The characters are lovable and cute, but the plot is not very original, and that is why I did not give it 10 stars. However, this movie keeps you smiling, and very few movies nowadays are able to do that. I am constantly quoting lines from this film, and searching up my favorite scenes on YouTube. An excellent lesson, cute characters, and humorous jokes are what make this movie what it is - AWESOME! And definitely worth your time!",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"I highly recommend ""Despicable Me"" for its ""pure"" comedy","""Despicable Me"" really is an animated family comedy. With such a simple, but clever, storyline of villain vs. villain, it is just a kids movie despite the many stars for attraction of an older audience.It is full of funny lines, which are not unsuitable or over kids' heads. Adults will be able to appropriately laugh throughout the film along with all the other kids. So many recent animated family comedies have claimed its funny for the adults and kids, but they have different jokes for them. Jokes that are inappropriate for kids that they don't understand and they sit there confused as their parents laugh at mature humour. The great thing about ""Despicable Me"" is that it's one of the first where it's so well written that it's the same jokes that the adults and kids will be laughing at. These jokes are sweet, simple and genuinely funny.Steve Carell is great as Gru, the struggling villain, who comes up with ludicrous plans to become a super villain. I was particularly impressed with Jason Segel as Vector, the super villain (who commits crimes with direction and magnitude). The original songs written for this movie are also catchy and humorous.I highly recommend ""Despicable Me"" for its ""pure"" comedy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
An incredibly passive experience that's serviceable but nothing more.,"'Despicable Me (2010)' is one of the most passive cinematic experiences I've had in a long time, with the franchise bleeding into itself to the point where it's genuinely difficult to tell which of the various 'bits' come from which of the three films. It's this lack of engagement that kills any real enjoyment, let alone emotional attachment, that could be found here. On the positive side, there are a few jokes that successfully land even though the humour is generally quite broad. There's also something to be said for the relatively believable and complete central character arc. Plus, the feature is generally well-made, even though it looks cheaper than most animated fare from the time. Some things are still just off, though, like how the feature struggles to establish spatial orientation or how the primary relationship wildly fluctuates from scene to scene, almost to the point where it feels like some sequences have been shifted retroactively. This is frustrating and makes it hard to become invested in its evolution, and the evolution of the relationship really is the cornerstone of the entire piece. Additionally, you can't forget that this is the feature that birthed the endlessly annoying pop-culture phenomenon that are the 'minions', so perhaps it can't be forgiven for that. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Mostly charming,"Despicable Me's first quarter is average and didn't really hook me much. However, the rest of the film improves and throughout remains a very good animated film. Carrel is amusing, and the best parts of the film involve him interacting with the three orphan girls. We know what to expect from this film, but it still remains very satisfying and the end credits are a blast to sit through. The kids were laughing throughout the film, and it seems as of this is more of a film for them than us. There are also some very touching moments, so in that respect check this film out. It may not be as great as Toy Story 3 or even How To Train Your Dragon, but it is definitely a strong addition to this year as far as animation goes.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A very 'in-the-moment' experience.,"Despicable Me is a short term film. It's playful, snappy, colourful and sporadically humorous. Watching it in 3D with my family was 95 mins well spent. Past that point it didn't offer much. Once the end credits rolled I barely gave the film a second thought. I have a feeling that a repeat viewing at home will render it dull and unwatchable. Well, for the parents at least. Only a few key moments have stuck with me since, but all of them can be found in the trailer anyway. This isn't to say the ephemeral Me isn't a movie worth watching, far from it in fact. It's just a very 'in-the-moment' experience, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.Steve Carell supplies Gru with an intriguing Russian-esquire accent, it adds another level of fascination to the character but Carell is talented enough to not let it slip into a camp Bela Lugosi parody. Gru's voice defines him and seems to be a perfect match for the super-villain's physical appearance, I would be interested to know which came first. The rest of the voice cast are strangely forgettable. Julie Andrews and Russell Brand are unrecognisable as Gru's mother and elderly sidekick respectively, whilst Jason Segal doesn't conjure up any laughs as the nerdy Vector.The animation is solid, if not groundbreaking. The creatively cute minions are visually funny and whenever they were on screen I had a smile on my face. Other images weren't as eye-catching as they should have been, such as Gru's stock-standard Addams family house and his over-sized automobile. The third dimension has been utilised well by directors Coffin and Renaud, depth is present throughout and the infrequent instances where an object lurches from the screen had the kiddies in awe, even if the adults won't find it all the spectacular.Take the children and enjoy it while it's on, don't be expecting a lasting impression though.3 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Cute, Masterpiece, Inventive and Kids will love this","Despicable Me is an animated comedy co-directed by Chris Renaud and Pierre Coffin, featuring Steve Carell as the character of Gru, a super-villain who presides over a secret lair populated by hundreds of little yellow creatures. Gru struggles to get funding from banks and adopts three orphans to infiltrate Vector's house. However, he becomes entranced by his little kids and wonders if fatherhood is more his style. The film is not as interesting as Syndrome from The Incredibles or Jim Carrey's Count Olaf in A Series of Unfortunate Events. Instead, it begins with the idea that villains are often more fascinating than heroes. Gru, inspired by James Bond villains, freeze-dries people in line at Starbucks and pops children's balloons. His lair is located in his suburban home's basement, and he dreams of dominating cable news ratings as the Greatest Villain of All Time. Despite its appeal, Despicable Me is not entirely original and is not as original as Pixar's great creations. Gru, voiced by Steve Carell, is a Russian mafioso with a Russian accent and a crazed Nazi. His life is complicated by his mother's voice, which sometimes reminds him of Rupert Pupkin. Gru's weapon is the Insta-Freeze Gun, but with the help of Dr. Nefario, he can use a Shrink Ray. His archrival Vector steals the Great Pyramid, and the Egyptians should establish a CGI-free zone around it. Gru is supported by his minions, who look like yellow exercise balls with one or two eyes apiece. He hatches a plan to use the Shrink Ray and steal the moon, and explains it to the Minions. The filmmakers bring in three cute kids, Margo, Edith, and Agnes, to restore good feelings.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Amazing? Not even close, but ""Despicable"", it is not","**1/2 out of (****)Despicable Me is one of those movies that are completely disposable, but in the moment, are fun, lighthearted, and humorous. And in the end, that's really all you can ask for. Surprisingly, the third dimensions actually please both audiences: those who despise 3-D as a gimmick, and those who despise 3-D as just an ""in-depth"" experience. I can say that I really don't care where the third dimensions goes, but this is probably the best 3-D film since Avatar. Despite the 3-D, the film is still pretty decent. The performances are strong, the premise is actually original, and the movie moves at a smooth pace. However, it has nothing on ""How to Train Your Dragon"", also released from DreamWorks. Still, it is forgettable fun and while not mind-blowing, it still has substance.""Despicable Me"" revolves around Gru (Carell), who wants to dethrone his opponent, who is also running for the world's most evil villain. Gru's plan is to steal the moon, but he adopts three children, which distract him from his plans.First off, the premise may not be entirely inventive, but it's just a tad more original than most children's films. Furthermore, I thought this movie was entertaining. Yes, it started a little slow at the beginning, but near the middle, the film picks up momentum. Moreover, I thought the performances were strong. Even the antagonists were pretty likable. Additionally, like I mentioned, the 3-D is the best since Avatar, no hyperbole. This 3-D is not conversion, it was actually shot in Real D 3-D which is certainly refreshing. Also, I just love those little minions. They are hilarious and just steal the show. You could make a movie about them and nobody else, yet you'd still enjoy the film.While the pros outweigh the cons, there are still some flaws. First off, the movie starts off a little tedious. It isn't a chore to sit through in the beginning, but nothing is incredibly entertaining. Furthermore, this movie's direction is uneven. The director has a plethora of ideas, but none of them stick together. It's just kind of all over the place. Moreover, this movie is way too predictable, but that's kind of what's expected. Also, it is a somewhat original, but a subplot or two has been used before, which was a little disappointing.Overall, ""Despicable Me"" is a pretty enjoyable family film. The jokes aren't too shabby, the performances are strong, and the premise is a little original. The 3-D is also an added bonus. It doesn't pack a punch like ""How to Train Your Dragon"" or ""Toy Story 3"", but it's still worthwhile on its own merits. Amazing? Not even close, but ""Despicable"", it is not. Despicable Me gets a mild recommendation in my book.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

In the middle of all of this, Gru gets 3 young girls that he is falling in love with as he is helping to take care of them. This is a fun movie to watch!",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A highly entertaining animated film.,"A highly entertaining animated film.When I see an animated film, I am drawn to comparisons with the wonderful PIXAR films. This film takes many clues form those and packs it up nicely and gives a film which is entertaining and nice. I can simply say. it's a nicely done formulaic animated film. It's formulaic coz we have seen such stories, a normal getting acquainted with kids and then going overboard to keep them happy. This reminded me Monsters Inc and even Finding Nemo.The purpose is different and so is the approach, but the crux remains the same and yes there is wonderful animation to admire. The army of minions is a treat to watch. The films has some wonderful moments too, where we feel something, we root for Gru, the supposed best villain of the planet, voice given by Steve Carell. Also, there are moments of hilarious laughter, cannot simply mention one but many.Essentially, there is a hero and there is a villain, the hero wins over villain. As simple as that this film can be pigeonholed, yet it gives the humane touch of feeling for one's own kids. A bad human trying to be good with those he loves. These themes are embedded well into a rather clichéd script and they make it interesting. Although, I did not die for it, I can safely say I like it, maybe I will not get back to this film, but any kid who would watch this, will more or less appreciate it. But since we are now acquainted so many films that such themes and have great quality. Those aspects might be demeaning this film.All the way down, I was mostly comparing the film, let me take it as a single film, now I love it. I love many things about this. The detailing of the characters, their brow to legs and even that wonderful story of Gru and the ballet story. Nice, and wow.Only that since it makes me compare films and lets me down by some bit, I am going with 4/5. This film is surely like able and for a few it may be even wonderful.

An enjoyable comedy with an exception of small minor problems,"Despicable Me is an enjoyable comedy flick with minor problems. Some jokes are extremely funny while some are just repeatedly stupid. Most of the really funny jokes are in the trailer and luckily I did not see the trailer before watching this film.Most of the characters are charming and cute. The main protagonist Gru is not a likable person in the film but as an audience we love him as a character. His accent is great; Steve Carell did a fantastic job. The orphans were a different story. Agnes was adorable of course but the other two weren't the great characters Gru and Agnes were. Edith is obnoxious and adds nothing to the story except some minor trouble that takes up a few seconds of screen time. She's really just there. Margo is actually important because she's the older sibling (the motherly figure). Therefore she conflicts with Gru a lot and it's about them resolving their differences. However I just didn't find her character as good as Agnes because Margo reminds me too much of my own mother. And in addition Agnes is the youngest but she seems like a better person than Margo. So what were they trying to do? Make Margo look mature while making the younger one the role model? I hated Vector, the antagonist. Not in a sense that he's a good character but in a sense I found him disgusting.I found the minions cute first but they were used way too much. Their squeaky high pitched voice gets redundant. This is the biggest and one of the few flaws of this film.The 3D is amazing. This isn't one of those movies that is released in 3D just for the sake of it. Despicable Me is a total eye candy. Objects will always pop out and there is a roller coaster scene as seen in the trailers and it is spectacular.

clichéd to the point where it hurts your brain,"When i first saw the trailers for this movie i was ready to dismiss it as a cheap dreamworks rip-off, but when i saw it got nominated for a golden globe and heard so many wonderful things about i decided to give it a watch.It's just awful, the premise seems somewhat interesting a villain tries to pull of his greatest heist yet, but keeps being outdone by a younger villain, but the story focus mainly on three girls, who make me wonder if anyone involved with this movie has ever spent any time with children, they are annoying and not in a ""cute"" way, they are all clichéd archetypes that make you want to reach out and choke them, which almost seems possible thanks to the quite good 3D, the whole movie looks really pretty in a strange way, everything is shiny for some reason, but it's annoying from start to finish and 30min into the movie it felt like torture, for me there is nothing redeemable about this movie in the slightest, i don't expect every movie to set the world on fire, but i do expect them to at least try something new, this all seemed like a textbook example of how to make a kids movie but with extra cheesiness.Having said that, my brother did enjoy himself and wanted to give it a 5/10, but for him the funniest/best scenes where the dancing scene (why do all kids movies need those?) and a scene wherein a man used his butt to operate a keyboard, so if that sounds like a good time for you, then go watch some youtube clips and skip this movie.",2.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Highly enjoyable animated fun!...,"I seem to remember this getting a fairly patchy response from the critics when it came out probably all that 3D nonsense. Fortunately I managed to avoid all that by waiting for it to appear on TV in the correct number of dimensions for the screen. As for the film, well I really enjoyed it! Likable characters, a nice plot and some great comic moments who could ask for more!? I'll give you further thoughts after this brief summary.Gru is a villain, he's been a villain for a long time, but now his evil deeds are being superseded by much younger up-and-coming villains. He's not happy, even his mother finds him a bit of a disappointment, but he has a plan. It's a very cunning and dastardly plan, but he'll need to steal a shrink ray gun and borrow some money from the bank first. He steals the ray, but it's stolen from him by a young upstart villain called Vector. Gru tries to retrieve it but cannot gain entry to his compound. Seeing three orphan girls get in by selling cookies, Gru forms another plan. He goes to Miss Hattie's Orphanage and adopts the three girls; Margo, Edith and Agnes. His plan: to get them into the compound so he can plant something there that will allow him to gain access to the ray gun. His many minions and Dr. Nefario help him with this clever scheme and it is a success but the girls have other ideas about Gru and, it seems, they just might be turning him away from his ultimate goal To steal the ****! Oops, hope I didn't say too much there Sorry Spoiler Police I, I'll come quietly.As I've already said, I enjoyed this film very much, it must me my kind of humour or something, but there were far more 'laugh out loud' moments (for me) than usual. The animation was very well done, I'd go so far as to say it was almost up to Pixar standard. I loved Steve Carell as the voice of Gru, his Russian accent was hilarious. Also worthy of note were the voice talents of; Jason Segel as Vector, Russell Brand as Dr. Nefario, Julie Andrews as Gru's Mom, Will Arnett as Mr, Perkins, Kristen Wiig as Miss Hattie, Miranda Cosgrove as Margo, Dana Gaier as Edith and Elsie Fisher as Agnes.One of the things I like to write about when reviewing a film is how it makes me feel. Well, this film did pull at the heartstrings a little, but much more than that it made me laugh. It's definitely one I will re-visit at some point because I'm sure there are many subtle little jokes I missed first time around. Whether you're young or slightly older (like me), I'm sure you'll get some laughs out of this one It's not perfect, but I very much enjoyed it nonetheless Recommended.My Score: 8.4/10.IMDb Score: 7.5/10 (based on 68,835 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 81/100 (based on 187 reviews counted at the time of going to press).",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Uni-Corny,"Greetings again from the darkness. Can't imagine there ever will be, but if there were to be a court trial against Pixar claiming unfair world animation domination, ""Despicable Me"" would surely be logged as Evidence A. Having the unfortunate luck of being released in the same year as Pixar's masterpiece ""Toy Story 3"", this is a fine children's film, but just no match.I am happy to report that the kids in the theatre seemed to respond very well to this one ... especially the Minions. If you have been to a movie in the past year, you have probably been exposed to the Minions - a group of cute, yellow tennis ball-looking creatures with either one or two eyes, a unique squeaking language and an infectious giggle/laugh. I found them to be the highlight of the movie as well.Basic story has Gru (Steve Carell voice) on a mission to be the world's best villain. He has had some success, but has been a financial disaster. We learn this when he visits the Bank of Evil and they reject his loan for his newest project - stealing the moon! Gru is in competition with a new, younger evil mastermind named Vector (Jason Segel voice). Gru and his inventor Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) are a step behind in technology, but manage to come up with a strategy.The plan involves cookie-selling orphans who Gru adopts. The story is pretty simple in that he initially plans to use them to trap Vector, but of course, Gru is the one who has his heart stolen by the 3 girls.It's mostly a cute presentation of a very simple story. Younger kids will get a kick out of it ... and don't seem to be as annoyed at Steve Carell's odd accent as I was. It comes across as a cross between Russian and German, but is easily enough understood.Don't expect the brilliance of Pixar, but it will entertain the youngsters.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

"""Despicable Me"" juxtapose to ""Toy Story 3""","""Despicable Me"" is centered around main character Gru voiced by a foreign sounding Steve Carell. Gru's main intention or only intention in life shall I say is to become the world's most renowned super-villain. His plan to achieve this status? Pull off the most insane heist known to man of course, steal the moon. But being the slouch Gru is, Gru must defeat his arch enemy Vector voiced by an underwhelming Jason Segal. Seeking help for his heist, Gru decides that adopting three orphan girls will be the missing ingredient to his heist. Will Gru pursue his evil plan, or will he eventually have a change of heart for the three little orphan girls?Of course being an animated film, characters need a voice to give them soul, right? Of course they do, let's not be silly! Steve Carell voicing the lead character Gru is probably the only thing this film has going for it. His accent is so goofy that you just buy it and roll with it. His delivery as always is spot on, making even the weakest of jokes seem funny. So in summary Steve Carell does exceptional work here. I wish I could compliment the rest of the cast here which is a disappointment considering the film has such an expansive cast of comedians. As I said earlier, Jason Segal as Gru's enemy Vector is extremely underwhelming. His voice is both annoying and conventional almost seeming like a knock off of Mandark on ""Dexter's Laboratory"". Also the fact that majority of the potty jokes were handed to Segal doesn't help either. Danny Mcbride voices Gru's neighbor, a character that has no impact whatsoever to the major story line. Such talent should have not been wasted on such a minor position. ""Get Him to the Greek's"" Russell Brand probably does the most tolerable work next to Steve Carrell as Dr. Nefario, Gru's right hand man. But even this performance isn't a standout.Perhaps what made the voice acting disappointing to me were the lines the actors had to read. Majority of the dialogue here resorts to toilet humor. It would have been okay if only some 5% of the jokes stooped down to this just to please the kids but when a whole movie's gags are based around this it becomes incomprehensibly annoying. Doing this really creates a barrier for likable character development. Sure the film is a cartoon, thus creating a world and characters larger than life but with clever writing even a rock can become a character in which you connect with.So maybe I was a bit spoiled with the animated masterpiece ""Toy Story 3"" that came out last month but seeing ""Despicable Me"" helped me realize something. It helped me realize why Pixar's movies work so well and other animated movies fall short of their glory. It's because above all else, story comes first. Not the voice talent, not the jokes, not the slapstick, but the main ingredient that makes any film in general enjoyable: the story. Pixar makes sure that everything is serviced to the story and not by it's minor counterparts. Contrary to ""Despicable Me"", it relies on it's gags and it's star talent. This is something if any film in general relies on it fails. May lessons be learned.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Wonderful Animation!,"Despicable Me is one of the better animated movies released this year. I think the only ones better than this were Toy Story 3 and How to Train Your Dragon. This movie probably will be nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars but it will lose to Toy Story 3.

I could recognize the funny Steve Carell.This movie has plenty of laughs. Even though this is a kid movie, I laughed a few times.

"Funny and cute, but there's something missed","IMDb 7.6/10 ROTTENTOMATOES 6.8/10 ALLMOVIE 3/5Two villains fight each other to be the more evil one. One stole a pyramid, so the other plans to steal the moon.Great for kids and good for parents. Good acting and animation. Often charming and cute without being corny. You see the whole thing coming but it doesn't matter because it's a fun ride. The Gru character is excellent. This movie proves that you don't need to be nasty or violent in order to be funny. Probably, the funniest Carrel's performance to date.On the bad side, the film lacks originality sometimes: the little girl is a carbon copy from the Monsters Inc one, one of the minions is Ned Flanders' copy and some jokes we have already watched them in other films.

The best animated movie of 2010,"First off, where on earth did Steve Carell pull this performance from? Sure he's great in the office and I really like the guy. But here we have such a powerful performance from him in voice only that just doesn't sit well with anything I've seen him in before. He went from a funny guy that you can't help liking to a powerhouse of a performer dragging you by the scruff of the neck into the movie. I loved the voice he came up with for Gru so much. Everyone else puts in just faultless performances too. Russell Brand isn't a fave of mine, I avoid movies he stars in, just not my cup of comedy tea but he's superb here. Even bit parts like the fat Texan? lady that runs the girls home, the performances were superb.And then we have the animation itself. I'm not sure whether it's the software that just took a technical leap in 2010 or not but the animation here is just Pixar perfect. You cannot fault it on any level. Everything from the imaginative, colourful set design, the brilliant character designs and the silky smooth emotion rich animation itself, it all just impresses the hell out of me.The story while simplistic enough for younger children to follow, has such warmth and heart that you really can't poke holes in it either.I adored this film and fell in love with the minions, the little girls and Gru. I'd happily have minion plushies on my couch and I'm an old fart of a guy. I keep saying ""It's so fluffy!"" to people and they look at me like I'm mad. I care not, they will eventually learn the line from the movie and if not, well there loss.Recommended for anyone who has a heart, a love of animation or just digs really well made comedies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Achieves pleasant balance of slapstick and sentimentality,"A splendid family viewing film. The animation is impressive, and utilizes its 3-D format well, but mildly over-indulges the technology in a few spots. The voice talents are all spot on, and the wide variety of colorful characters are skillfully played off one another.The ""Despicable"" villain is a woefully inept klutz who uses Oompa-Loompa type sidekicks (toys for sale, anyone?) to pull off weird over-the-top crimes. His rival pulls off the crime of the century, causing him to hatch an evil scheme to regain status among villains. Enter the foils, three cute little orphan girls dreaming of being adopted. The sweet innocents were genuine, and give this story a lot of heart. Soon they are newly adopted daughters and unwitting accomplices in a Trojan Horse scheme.The girls have a disarming and melting charm with their ingenuous and sincere spirit, a perfect counterpoint to ""Despicable."". The bonding of the parties and its awkward but warm start are genuine and touching.

Gru will win you.,"Gru: We are going to pull off the TRUE crime of the century... we are going to steal the MOON!Although Despicable Me winks at behemoth Pixar with a little robot like the Pixar desk lamp before the titles, Despicable Me does one better in the cynical category.A villain of major contradictions and the cutest orphans since Annie help create a world of kid fantasy that still tries to deal with crazy parents and malign technology. It does so, not in Pixar's full color wonderland, but rather in a dim dream like state where the villain Gru (voice of Steve Carell) is vulnerable in a laboratory of worthless weapons with an assistant, Dr Nefario (Russell Brand), like Bond's Q, but with worse hearing (he responds to making a dart gun by crafting one that begins with an ""f"").But the real gift of this little animation gem is homely Gru, the world's best villain but financially least productive. His plan to steal the moon is about the cleverest comment on how much we have stolen, innocence among the treasures; the moon is all we have left to lose. But there is also something else to be stolen—Gru's heart—and that's easily filched by Agnes, Margo, and Edith, orphans selling the equivalent of girl scout cookies but sub textually a heart for a villain who doesn't know yet it's a loving parent's.You'll have to see how he steals the moon and the girls' affection because these improbable actions come straight from a child's sense of how the universe is really run. As in the sequences of Gru reading bad kiddy lit to the girls, the screenplay could have been an insult to child intelligence—it's not.It's so good that so far two of the best films of the summer and maybe the year have been 3-D animations from Pixar and Universal, its first and I hope not its last.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Light Bulb!,"Light Bulb."" It took a little time for the light bulb to turn on in ""Despicable Me"", but when it finally does it actually becomes a good film. The slow start almost ruined it for me but luckily the visuals were good enough to keep me intrigued while the directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud figured out where they were going with the movie. And I must say when they finally figured things out it completely turned the movie around for the better.The movie has an all-star voice cast, but ironically the actors changed their voices so much that they are almost unrecognizable. This actually makes the characters memorable as themselves and not as the actors who voice them. Russell Brand who voices Gru's assistant Dr. Nefario is completely unrecognizable and I only knew it was him because of the credits. Even Will Arnett, who I find hilarious because of his deep raspy voice, was barely recognizable as voicing the bank manager Mr. Perkins. Steve Carell almost disappointed me with his vocal performance of Gru. The Russian accent he used for Gru was just okay and it seemed like it took him half the movie to get comfortable with the character. Luckily for him the animation of Gru was so good that the character would have been funny voiced by anyone.Read full review at FlicksWorthWatching.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

"""Light-bulb!""","Despicable Me (1) (2010) -How much fun is this film?! Since the first time I watched it and all of the subsequent occasions of seeing it again, it has never failed to make me laugh and to put a huge smile on my face. It really was my sort of humour, with such a great and diverse collection of jokes for everyone. Some of it similar to the antics of 'Wile E. Coyote', with other bits more 'Bugs Bunny', but whoever your favourite cartoon character is, there was some of their comedy in here.It was full of great characters. Agnes was obviously adorable, but I recognised a lot of myself in the skepticism of Margo and the mischief of Edith. Even Gru himself was a criminal character that deserved love and whoever created the minions, can probably sleep soundly every night, safe in the knowledge that they have brought pure joy to the world and probably that their bank balances will never be empty.It was actually some of the smaller and more subtle jokes that were the best and in general it was just such a funny and silly film that I couldn't help but grin like an idiot all the war through it.It also had a superb soundtrack of songs by Pharrell Williams. I will never be sad listening to 'Happy', which seems like an obvious thing to say, but it really was a song that has all of the right noises to bring pleasure to even the darkest lives.A sheer joy to watch again and again.906.71/1000.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Despicable Me is just like Bolt & Cloudy with the Meatballs, which are entertaining but just not FUNNY.","DESPICABLE ME – CATCH IT ( B ) Despicable Me is a good animation experience but not great. I feel the story was repeated hundred times before. When you get the privilege to create an animation world, where you can introduce whole new world all together, creators should have used that privilege to full extent but they didn't. Despicable Me fails in that department, the yellow miniatures thumbs are really funny & cute but besides that we didn't found anything funny or exciting in the movie. Despicable Me choose two repetitive stories, 1) One guy wants to bring another guy down on any means. 2) An angry man somehow becomes caretaker of Orphans and in beginning he hates them and in the end he becomes the dutiful father figure. So, we have seen this million times before on Big Screen and on T.V, So, when the movie was over it was almost forgettable for me because when you're watching it, it's all colorful and Bright but once it's over, you don't even remember it. Besides that it's very one dimensional, I mean its all about the villains What people or government thinks about the villains or about capturing them? They just announce on T.V that someone has stolen Egypt pyramid or Moon? That's all? Their is nothing mentioned about people or government living in that villains world.

Despicable Me: 8/10,"Though its materials are mostly cliché and have been used in Hollywood for a long time, Despicable Me delivers its high-class materials with charms, cute, and heartfelt style. Steve Carrell's voice performance is probably the better ones of voice performances I've seen in years. His cute minions also helped add to the film's quirkiness. Gru, a criminal mastermind voiced by Steve Carrell, was on his way to conquering the world when he ran into three orphan girls and adopted them. Margo, Edith, and Agnes was in a home since they can remember and being adopted by anyone at this point is a joy for them. But after staying with Gru for a day, the kids were horrified. After months of teaching and nurturing, the kids were able to get Gru to be nicer. The story progress with Gru choosing between his evil plan and his kids.

The lead kid was just such a brat and that made the movie annoying, the other kid was just making me mad by being there, and the little girl just gave me headaches; it wanted to shoot myself, that little squeaky voice was just unbearable.

In terms of words we have no words!,"I only watched Despicable Me so that I could understand what was the deal with the Minion memes that moms share on Facebook. Turns out the movie is nothing like the cringe that is shown in them, especially considering Minions don't even talk properly. In fact it has more in common with the Reddit memes.The story is quite nice. I like seeing stories like Shrek and The Angry Birds Movie, where some arrogant outcast wants to be left alone but slowly develops feelings and compassion for those whom they go out with an adventure with. Here Gru has his three adopted daughters - Margo, Edith and Agnes. Initially they look just like some cute troublemakers, until Gru starts doing his own things.The thing which I like the most about this movie is the dynamic roster of characters. Vector is a funny villain who kinda reminds me of Syndrome from The Incredibles, except he's a nerd and has a funny voice. I laughed every time he used his fish gun. I was expecting Gru to be a very annoying character, the way he looked. But his voice is so cool, and the way he was introduced was somehow very satisfying to watch. Then there's Dr Nefarious, who seems to be somewhat of a paternal figure to all the Minions.Despicable Me is nothing more than what it pretends to be: A simple, fun to watch animated movie with cute and funny characters meant for the laughs. It's something you'd watch only if you want to spend some time with children.

Neither Despicable Nor Great,"The premise of ""Despicable Me"" seemed simple. The idea was to take a colorful villain and put him at the center of a film. This idea stemmed from the notion that, in many Good v. Evil stories, the villain steals the show from the blander or less compelling protagonist (see ""Austin Powers""). I applaud the creators of ""Despicable Me"" for their attempt, but not so much for their execution.At the start of ""Despicable Me,"" we see the allegedly dastardly Gru performing small acts of rudeness; he comes off immediately as a bully with a big car. We soon learn that Gru has assembled a horde of so-called ""minions"" to accomplish such wicked ends as stealing the statue of liberty and the Eiffel tower. Embracing the silliness of the archetypal megalomaniac, the film then creates a rivalry between Gru and fellow villain Vector, both of whom try to steal the moon. This overblown rivalry leads to scenes of eye-popping physical comedy. It also allows the film's creators to show off the hijinks of the minions, who manage to be both adorable and riveting to watch. While they don't always serve the plot, they're always a blast to behold, and they save the film from the masses of cookie-cutter animated films. Unfortunately, other aspects of the story cannot be saved from such a wasteland of incompetence.The primary problem with ""Despicable Me"" is that it becomes a generic ""curmudgeon softens up"" story before too long. In an attempt to force the viewer to sympathize with the supposedly villainous Gru, the creators strip away his villainous qualities. Instead of wreaking havoc, Gru begins to learn what it takes to be a good father. Suddenly strapped with three kids, Gru becomes attached to them. Sadly, when he finally settles into his new lifestyle, a wrench enters the works. We've seen this plot line before, most notably in ""Kramer v. Kramer,"" and it doesn't belong in such an otherwise silly and light-hearted film. As an attempt at emotional resonance, the father-figure story will work just fine for families, but it didn't work for me.""Despicable Me"" is a lean machine; I only wish it were a little meaner.What begins as a clever spin off of the superhero genre becomes a run-of-the-mill tale of parenting and love, but hey- at least it has minions.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Fine,"This sort of production needs a few things to be proper at all, and this here does tick those boxes fairly decently enough.It's for kids and therefor ultimately it needs some form of moral that develops through the whole film, something you can see building and follow and finally come to a successful conclusion. It's well emphasized from the very title, to particular scenes, that the main character is terribly selfish so this is more of how he finds love through others, love he himself never received as a child from his parents, so that's well emphasized and well made, and important for children to assimilate at a young age. And it's done with emotion and sentiment here as to be more effective and long-lasting.Another thing needed is a fun authentic universe of some sort: the minions introduced here in this one, along with the particular awfully caricatured character designs, so that box can be ticked as well.Another thing would be humor. Obviously, this has a moral and everything but isn't a documentary. Voice actors like Steve Carell or Segel aren't picked for anything but to be amusing comedians, which they are, and so the jokes have to be there. The humor is fine, some of it is really funny but it's rare and most of it is pretty standard for this sort of thing.Overall, one wouldn't call it rushed so much as it is very formulaic. You wouldn't imagine it would take all that much to produce such a story and characters, but eh, it's alright and it's got some substance and material to it.6.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Despicable When Compared to Toy Story 3,"A.O. Scott, journalist of The New York Times, said ""while there's nothing to hate, there's not much to remember"" about Despicable Me and he's 100% correct. While Best Buy does have a special app for Smartphones and iPhones for this (will state what it does and is at the end) called ""Best Buy Movie Mode"" which is something I can pretty soon seeing all movies have at one point, this film is still just a poor copy of How the Grinch Stole Christmas. Surely Universal Pictures did a great job animating it and it really looks like the equivalent to a much more recent (and better) film, Toy Story 3. But still, it has the ability for animation, but it doesn't have the fun and morals that are packed in a Pixar film.To sum it up, after a pyramid is stolen in Egypt, we are introduced to Gru (Steve Carell) who is the second best super-villain in the world, right behind Vector (Jason Segel), who stole the pyramid. To fight back, Gru then develops a plan to shrink the moon which he believes will make him the best super-villain. After Vector steals his shrink ray which was to make Gru able to shrink the moon to pocket size, he adopts three girls; Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Edith, and Agnes to sell cookies to Vector for Gru to be able to take his shrink ray back and continue with his plans. Gru is also armed with thousands of yellow one and two eyed minions. They are the cutest and best thing by far about the movie. Though their English is below average and some words you can understand, but most you cannot, which is where the app comes in.The cute Minions make up the entire film.Best Buy Movie Mode was created so when you ""enter Movie Mode"" on your phone when directed by the screen itself, your phone will sync the movie and when the credits come your phone will vibrate (no confusion since the app disables your ringer) and it will subtitle what the little yellow fellows are saying. Its kind of cool, and since I was the only one in the entire theater laughing at the screen when everyone just watched trying to understand them, I felt like I knew more than they did (when I did).Still, it would make more sense if the app buzzed and dubbed what the Minions were saying throughout the movie rather than just at the end. But it was just as equally impressive. I was worried about starting it to early because I thought if I started it during the previews, the phone (which is a Motorola Droid) would think its the beginning and start dubbing when the credits weren't there yet. But the phone syncs it with the film which is almost amazing. Ahh, technology.But the movie itself, wasn't great. Below good, mediocre is the word. The film is a first degree knockoff of The Grinch and next to nothing is memorable. Ill remember the app (which isn't in the movie, so it doesn't count) and Ill remember the Minions. But the Minions are like the penguins in Madagascar. Their the best part, they deserve their own film, instead you are boring us with a back story and basically shielding the good parts away. At least Madagascar still holds up with jokes and doesn't let the secondary characters put on a one (or one thousand) man show.Many kids will love this, but when compared to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Fantasia 2000, Pinocchio, and most recently Toy Story 3. The film just doesn't do it. Take Toy Story 3. The art in that is not only the animation, but the fun the film has. It takes your imagination on a whole new route reintroducing characters that have grown like us. A.O. Scott says its like ""art and junk"". Which it rightfully is. Besides the great voice work (mainly from Carell and Cosgrove) and good animation, the film is just despicably fair.With Voice Talents of: Steve Carell, Jason Segel, Russell Brand, Julie Andrews, Will Arnett, Kristen Wiig, Miranda Cosgrove, Dana Gaier, and Elsie Fisher.

There's no question that the film contains some terrific animation and it's certainly got some wonderful visuals including Gru's over-sized car with its rocket fire shooting out. Another wonderful visual was the stuff in space dealing with kidnapping the moon. The idea of the moon getting stolen was such a neat little idea one wishes that more time had been focused on it.The vocal performances are all very good with Carell and Jason Segel really standing out.

It really goes to show that no matter what you have done, you can make a comeback. You can redeem yourself for the not so good that you've done. This movie also goes to show that there will be people there to care for you, when you least expect it. Whenever Gru realizes that he cares for the girls and they care for him too, you can see that moment where he opens his eyes and makes a change.

Despicably good,"Yet another charming and funny animation based on comic-book-type super-villainy as Mr Bad Guy Groo gets side-tracked in his grand plan to steal the moon by the initially unwelcome intrusion into his life by three little orphan girls with a combined cute factor of about a bazillion. That last detail alone signposts in advance that sentimentality is going to play a major part in the story and sure enough it all ends happily if of course tearfully ever after.Along the way, we get some terrific animation, the 3D version I watched being particularly impressive, with lots of inventive set-ups, none better than a roller-coaster ride simulation as well as Groo's final spaceship-to-spaceship rescue of his three charges at the end.The essential aspect of humour doesn't fail either, the three distinct personalities of the orphans (one matronly, one pesky and one cute) offering plenty of scope for laughs, as do Groo's heart-of-stone mother (improbably voiced by Julie Andrews), his nerdy super-villain rival Vector, not forgetting Groo's mute but otherwise multi-faceted lemming-like bots. Less successful though, I thought was the characterisation of Groo's crime partner inventor Dr Nephario, although this may have a lot to do with my ingrained aversion to the non-talent that is Russell Brand.I also found the soundtrack by Pharrell Williams (who he?) very Michael Jackson-lite, no doubt Justin Beiber's brand of baby-pop will feature in the sequel. No, I'll remember better the genuinely funny moments inserted just for us adults like Groo's bots rallying round with their worldly possessions to fund his master-plan to steal the moon, very ""It's A Wonderful Life"" where buffs will surely remember James Stewart also trying to lasso the moon for wife Donna Reed, likewise the nameplate for the Bank of Evil (which funds criminal plots), which bears the legend ""formerly Lehman Brothers"".In the end though, all you can do is chalk up another plus to the animator whizz-kids who demonstrate yet again their ability to create another hugely entertaining, funny, occasionally witty and yes, family-friendly entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Rather disappointing,"I usually only write reviews of movies which I particularly like.

This is one of those VERY standard movies that makes you wonder if a script is actually being written after a great deal of brainstorming and creative discussion or if it is just being copy-pasted from the last blockbuster.

"Funny, witty and touching animation","Despicable me is, of course, a children's film so the bad guy (who's the good guy) isn't actually that bad at all. The bad guy, who is the bad guy isn't really that bad either, so that's good (for children). There's little in this that children would find really scary and compared to the horribly sad portions of The Rescuers - for example - where Penny and her teddy were completely alone, the orphans (all three) in this were feisty, self reliant and rather well adjusted. It still had tender moments but didn't have the darkness of Disney.Gru voiced by Steve Carell was very well drawn, and performed. He had a whimsy about him, which made me think of Austin Powers, and his minions - the little yellow creatures that were the stand out stars of the film - are just so cute, each with his (or her) own personality. Jason Segal as the nemesis villain Vector was very funny and I thought he was voiced by Chris D'Elia such was the vocal range, so was impressed with Segal. Very funny. Like Disney and Pixar, the film is for children but there is plenty for adults and I didn't once think ""oh this is a naff children's film"" but rather was immersed and entertained for the duration, captivated in fact.With the combination of the minions' antics and the little orphan girl Agnes and how adorable she was, and the silly plot to steal the moon, the crazy gadgets and immediate one-liners I loved every minute. It's not meant to be taken seriously and those critics who are saying how it defies the laws of physics and point out the ""goofs"" are just far too sad. It's a cartoon, and a very good one at that and I think Illumination have Pixar in their sights in terms of quality and skill. Its a fun film for all the family, with a lot of heart.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A villain with heart,"""Despicable Me"" is a delightful animated film that strikes a perfect balance between humor and heart. The story centers on Gru, a supervillain voiced by Steve Carell, who plans to steal the moon but finds his world turned upside down when he adopts three orphaned girls.The animation is vibrant and engaging, bringing the whimsical world of Gru and his mischievous Minions to life. The Minions, with their slapstick humor and adorable antics, steal many scenes and provide plenty of laughs.Steve Carell's performance as Gru is a standout, infusing the character with a blend of gruffness and vulnerability. The relationship between Gru and the three girls, Margo, Edith, and Agnes, evolves in a touching and believable way, adding emotional depth to the film.While the plot is fairly predictable, ""Despicable Me"" excels in its execution, delivering a fun and heartwarming experience. The film's charm lies in its ability to blend humor, action, and genuine emotional moments, making it a memorable and enjoyable watch for audiences of all ages.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Vector oh yeah,This fun filled film from 2010 is one of the best animated films ever the minions are top tier and the villain vector is one of the best in the history of villains. The plot makes sense they want to be the best villain in the world and have to get attention by doing something big like stealing something of importance.This film is dumb and that can be the funny part of it. The minions speak their own language and are funny by their actions or their addiction to bananas.The animation is also very good from a film from 2010 which shows it still holds up and has not aged.This film is a heap of fun filled madness so it is with honour to give it.9/10 = amazing animated film.,9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A memorable introduction. The beginning of Juggernaut. So much fun.,"Our introduction to Gru and his Minions.Being the first entry into the franchise you didn't know what to expect. Looking back at it now it was very crude. The Minions weren't as refined as they are now. Visually they looked choppy. Even Steve Carell's voice work was a little different. Not a knock on the movie, just makes me appreciate the current stuff even more.The film will go down in history as being very important. It has spawned many sequels, a spinoff, and countless merchandise. Many quotable moments, such as: It's so fluffy! It's a juggernaut at this point.The characters are really strong, so it doesn't really matter what happens around them at the moment. Insert the Minions and Gru into anything, and it will be fun.I forgot how heartwarming this particular movie was. All the love Gru has for the girls, it's very touching. He slowly fell in love with them and by the end they were part of his family.The overall story was very simplistic. You have to accept these kinds of things, especially when you consider who the target audience is. Bad guy steals something, adventure in the middle, then ""good"" guy gets it back, and End movie. Tried and true formula.A bunch of funny moments, mixed in with adventure and suspense, makes this a must watch for any kid. In actuality, a must watch for anyone really.This gets a LennyReviewz Score of: 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Not at all despicable!,"Animated films aimed at younger children seem to have a dual audience, the kids and the adults. This film succeeds on both levels. (I currently use Up! as part of my media course, but Despicable Me is a close 3rd - The Lion King, a 2nd) I am biased, unashamedly so, but the stand- out for me in this dizzying film, ending with a sense of belonging, and acceptance / redemption, dotted with wit, throw-away lines, aha moments, and emotional connectedness, is Julie Andrews, who voices the terrible mother, with aplomb and a good accent. She, in an essentially supporting role, is excellent. And the main voices are equally as good!! See the film: it is well worth it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

A Fair Film for all,"Despicable Me is base on a story according to the credits. By all the advertising, one might think that this would a disaster. Well Their wrong.The story centers on a international villain who plans to capture the moon with the help of 3 orphans. The movie has definitely introduced a line of lovable memorable characters that might be inspired of such as Garfield: The Movie and Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs to name a few (and even an episode of Pompeii Pete from The Wacky World of Tex Avery). The marketing contain yellow characters known to be Minions.The animation is in CGI/3-D, what we've come to see so much of these days. Not only do some of the backgrounds a what matches the movie, but the characters all look so mild and were made with the right people. The show makes use of exaggerated anatomy with various-shaped heads, but by taking a good look at the show, one would realize that exaggerated anatomy doesn't work in 3-D. The animation is very smooth and work as well in 3-D.Despite the issues Gru is having, there are still some good times to be had with Agnes and her Unicorn. then you've likely seen it in the commercials.

Excellent Family Entertainment,"After such a wide success with a couple of animated films in the mid 90s and early 21rst century, a boom occurred in the full CGI animated family films and it hasn't stopped. Several productions have came into play and flourished and or fizzled. Recalling a couple franchises that fizzled was Shark Tale (2004) & Hop (2011). Unfortunately, along with the power of the technology, came the abuse of it. But just like Pixar, Illumination Entertainment put in a lot of effort and time into a family film that packs a punch for all ages.Despicable Me is the story of a troubled genius named Gru. Gru isn't truly evil, he just doesn't have much of anyone to care for. And like many other troubled characters, it is because of a rough childhood. Thus leading to hard times as an adult trying to connect with the outside world. Thankfully, with the help of three little girls, Gru learns more about himself than he ever thought he knew before. A good thing to note is that the writers to this movie have the experience. Cinco Paul & Ken Daurio have written screenplays for various animated films and directors. And along with the story come some very entertaining characters.And I think we all know what those characters are - the yellow skinned minions. As many know now, the minions are the mascot to the famed ""Despicable"" franchise. With their innocent yet reckless nature and garbled language, the minions are the ones that'll have audiences rolling over the floors. But these aren't the only characters that make the movie fun. The main voice actors do a great job as well filling in their roles. Steve Carell as Gru was a perfect casting choice. Gru's assistant, Dr. Nefario voiced by Russell Brand was also a great achievement. I didn't even realize it was him until the credits rolled.Along with them are Jason Segel who plays another villain named Vector, Will Arnett voices the head of bank and many others. It's interesting to try and figure out who voices who because the characters are masked so well. The animation and score to the film produced by Heitor Pereira and Pharrell Williams is well executed too. Each scene represented the right emotion and had a consistent tone. Though I would have preferred to hear a main theme. It probably would have made the film even more memorable.The voice cast is awesome which makes the characters likable allowing the comedic moments to bring out the fun in the movie. Many people will consider the minions to be the best part.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

A Fiendish Delight,"Gru (voiced with faux-eastern-Euopean gravitas by Steve Carell) is a nefarious Supervillain in the midst of crisis: a younger nemesis named Vector (voiced by ""Freaks and Geeks"" alum Jason Segel) is stealing his fiendish thunder, his most recent acquisition being a Shrink Ray. In order to engender the good faith necessary in the bank that gives Gru loans to carry out his schemes (even Supervillains aren't immune to the bureaucratic red tape we normal citizens must contend with), he adopts three precocious orphan girls to unwittingly aid in his scheme to steal the moon, a heist so astronomical it will place him back at the top of the Supervillain ladder. That's ""Despicable Me,"" in a nutshell. Yet the film is so richly textured (in both its exquisite animation and storytelling) that it becomes something transcendent of the usual doldrums of summer popcorn fodder. The character arcs are well-executed, the gadgets and gizmos are awesome to behold, and the eventual tenderness that seeps into Gru's dark heart is affecting without being sappy. As for Gru's squeak-uttering, cyclopean yellow ""minions""--they're a riot, adding an extra layer of slapstick humor to the proceedings. With so much overuse and abuse of the 3D medium as of late (with the cynical cash-grabs of ""Clash of the Titans"" and ""The Last Airbender"" being the most high-profile), it is refreshing to see it used so well in ""Despicable Me""--it is a visual feast that helps bring its underlying emotions into even sharper focus.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Some other major villain just did a big job and now he sets his sights even higher. In order to accomplish this he needs something his arch-enemy has and find the only way to get it is to employ 3 little orphans who can get inside his lair by selling cookies.The movie goes exactly where you think it will and some the jokes fall flat, but at its core is good feeling story of redemption and parental love. There is something for everyone in this. I took my wife and 4 kids (11,8,4 and 4) and everyone loved it. It's not perfect though. Some jokes just were not that funny to me (although a lot of people in the theatre were laughing at them). I also didn't see it in 3D and it looks like it would have been fun to watch in 3D.

Despicable Me: Laughter-Filled Larceny,"Step aside, Mr. Bond, there's a new villain in town. Enter Gru, a supervillain with a penchant for purple and a serious sweet tooth (for mini cupcakes, that is). Despicable Me whisks us away on a hilarious heist (of adorable orphans, no less) that melts even the iciest of hearts. But is this animated caper all sunshine and lollipops, or does it have a few hidden banana peels?First, the good stuff: Gru is a comedic gem. Steve Carell brings him to life with a glorious grumpiness that's somehow endearing. His interactions with his adorable (and mischievous) minion army are pure comedic gold, their gibberish language somehow conveying more wit than you'd expect. The animation is top-notch, with vibrant colors and a unique retro-futuristic style that adds to the film's charm.The story itself is a heartwarmer, seasoned with giggles. Gru's initial villainous plot takes a detour when he unexpectedly adopts three orphaned girls. Their wide-eyed innocence and relentless cheer slowly chip away at his hardened exterior, proving that even the most despicable villain has a gooey center (just don't tell him I said that). It's predictable, sure, but executed with so much sweetness and humor that you can't help but smile.So, is Despicable Me worth your time? Absolutely! It's a delightful family film with enough laughs for adults and enough sweetness for kids. It might not be groundbreaking animation, but it delivers on its promise of fun, heartwarming entertainment. Just be prepared for a sugar rush and the occasional minion-induced earworm.Final verdict: 7 out of 10 bananas. Despicable Me is a charming, funny, and ultimately heartwarming film that will steal your heart (and maybe a few chuckles). Just remember, even villains deserve a second chance, especially when they have minions that speak in gibberish but somehow make perfect sense.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Pleasantly Surprised!,"Despicable Me was on a double feature at the drive in while we were vacationing in Maine. Our kids had never been to a drive in and we wanted to see Toy Story III, so we figured we would ""sit through"" ""Despicable Me"" in order to get to Toy Story III. Much to our delight, the trailers and ads for this gem did it very little justice. My impression from the commercials was that this was a juvenile and pointless kids cartoon. To the contrary, Despicable Me was funny, poignant and thoroughly enjoyable. It probably falls just a shade behind TSIII - which was on par with I and II - but not by much. The ""voice"" cast was excellent, the animation was great and the story - which is not conveyed at all in the trailers - was fantastic.

"Despicable Me delivers with harmless fun, and a few laughs","I wasn't expected to see this film but decided to watch it anyway since seeing many positive reviews and feedback. The plot seemed a little weird and far-fetched for me, but while watching it, it seemed a little better and rather original. The basic plot outline is: An evil man (Gru) who adopts three small girls just to use them in his evil plot to steal something and then return them to the orphanage after they no longer serve his purpose. A few more details but that's about it.What steals the movie in Despicable Me are the minions. They are the little yellow one-eyed and two-eyed guys you see in the commercials and the trailers. They don't speak English, but that definitely does not lessen their effect. They are fiercely loyal to Gru and they seem to take his experiments in stride. The minions even dress up and head out to a department store in one of the more memorable scenes in the movie.The thing about this movie is that they do not always go for the one-time quick joke. There are several jokes that run throughout the movie, and that work very well. Unlike, Megamid, this comedy doesn't have cheesy and clichéd humour- Despicable Me doesn't try too hard to get laughs. This is an entertaining movie for adults and children, it definitely does not drag itself out as new movies seem to and it is most definitely very, very fluffy. Seeing as they're planning a sequel, I could see it being pretty good and Im interested about what it will be about.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

"Despicable Me is a fun animation because the minions and Agnes, but it ends up being subtracted by the script's flaws","""Despicable Me"" doesn't even come close to threatening Pixar. But that does not mean that this first work by Ilumination Entertainment does not have its own brilliance. When telling a story of fatherhood, adding a very special spice to the formula, this beginner studio introduces us to a group of characters that are quite fun and charming in their own way.The plot is simple: after being overtaken by newcomer Vector, the villain Gru (Steve Carell) wants to return to being the biggest criminal mind in the world, with his master plan to steal the moon. However, for this, he needs a shrinking ray, which ends up in the hands of his rival. Gru then devises a way to get his hands on the gun, but in order to enter the fortress of Vetor, he needs the help of Agnes (Elsie Fisher), Edith (Dana Gaier) and Margo (Miranda Cosgrove, three orphaned girls who sell But the girls can exert an influence on Gru that the villain could never have predicted.Directed by strangers Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud, the animation starts well by exploring the protagonist's moody attitudes and managing to convert them into laughter for the audience. The bet on exaggeration and the total lack of pretension count in favor of the feature, which seems to be there only to provide a half hour of pure entertainment, not to mention philosophical reflections or exaggerated emotions. How pleasant it is to watch the opening sequence and realize that it serves only to introduce the mystery and whose characters will no longer appear throughout the rest of the film.One of the most interesting aspects of the script is playing with cliché situations making them as credible as possible. Now, Gru's personality is explained by the absence of a happy childhood. The mother (as cruel as) always disowned him, but this is told in such a colorful way, so in the joke, that it is impossible not to understand the subject without much laughter. And this is the great difference of this animation in relation to many others launched annually: the lack of something mushier. Practically everything in history is treated with such debauchery that the smile comes easily with each picture, with each shot. Not even when little orphans enter the scene with their search for a home does the film fall into cheap sentimentality. After all, the three little ones may have been abandoned and act suspiciously towards their new father, but they are smart enough to turn everything into a separate show. Especially when they win the hearts of Minions.The look of the film is very cartoonish, ranging from the characteristics of its characters to its art direction. The design is very colorful and bright, contrasting precisely with the story, which is told from the point of view of a ""villain"", with the absence of a more classic hero. And the most interesting point of the film is precisely the evolution of its protagonist. Gru is presented to us as a man who loves to be mean, whether it hurts small children, crashes other vehicles with his rocket car or performs his blows. Gradually, we get to know the villain better and discover that he was not always like this, making his relationship with girls and his consequent personal growth not to be forced.In common with ""The Incredibles"", this film has the fact that its characters live in urban areas, in full view of ordinary people. However, this ends up taking away some of the strength of the story, as the plot would need to take place either in a city of blind or idiots to not notice some absurdities, such as Gru's rocket car or the gap opened in the middle of the public road by protagonist at the end of the second act. What makes us ignore these ""small"" flaws is the charisma of the characters. While the trio of orphans, each with their own personality, conquers us as much as Gru himself, he becomes the most complex and lovable figure in the film, even with his ""evil"". His relationship with his partner, the mad scientist Dr. Nefario, with his fun minions and his own mother reveal a lot about the protagonist himself and amuses the audience at the same time. In fact, the scenes between Vetor and the director of Banco do Mal are echoed precisely in the sequences starring Gru and his mother. Other interesting insights are the visual references and narratives planted by screenwriters Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul (""My Santa is Noel 2"") during the film, referring to ""The Godfather"", making jokes with the film industry and even with the economy American (that only adults will understand, by the way).The development of the plot, however, weakens its originality. Jokes stop working, creativity stops and didacticism takes over the narrative. When introducing the three girls to Gru's life, the script by Ken Daurio, of the good ""Horton and the World of the Who"", begins to fall into common place. The original situations are replaced by the comedy of customs, showing the adaptation of the girls in the house of the now stepfather and the subsequent approximation between their sweetness and his brutality. The long, in short, becomes predictable. In addition, the confrontation between antagonist and protagonist, in the incessant attempt to steal the Moon, never thrills. Vector is an extremely boring villain, starting with physical attributes, unable to attract the charisma or hatred of the spectators. His technological inventions are so many and so poorly selected that we are not impressed when he pulls out a squid gun in the final sequence.The only good attraction of ""Despicable Me"" is Gru's little yellow assistants, the so-called minions. With an indecipherable language and an insane desire to carry out disorders, beings are included in hilarious situations, ranging from an unexpected trip to the city's supermarket to serving as guinea pigs for scientific experiments by the not-so-funny Dr. Nefario. In a comparison between animations, it would not be inappropriate to say that the minions function like the penguins of ""Madagascar"". Liking small yellow pets is easy, but the French team led by Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud also manages to create an empathy between the public and the villainous Gru, showing a little of the reasons that led him to be who he is. And, believe me, this is gigantic merit. If the project had fallen into less skilful hands, Gru's story with his mother could easily tip over to the boring or pedantic. Here, it is just another comic element.However, the indecisive construction of adult characters. It is not a resource where the script develops each character and we see its character change along the tape. The case of Despicable Me is that we have the false impression that all adults are bad people, but in the end, they become good people or are boycotted by their own stupidity, as in the case of Vetor and his father. So we thought: if most of the characters appear to be villains, but they don't really fall into that category, why was the film built as a world of monsters for children - in the best style of Unfortunate Events will see animation? If only this were really worked on, maybe we would have another impression, but from the first minutes of Gru on the screen, we realize that the premise about him is totally false! The big guy with the weird voice is no longer a villain even before the girls arrive, who are supposed to show him another way. It is not interesting to see characters sold with an ""X"" premise just to make the story count. If there are changes, they need to be motivated and not pre-conceived and hidden to a convenient point in the film.The film is really quite fun and has an interesting family appeal, but for an animation with this slightly more mature proposal, the cartoonish character and the ""Coyote and Papaleguas"" relationship between Gru and Vetor goes in a completely opposite way to what it should. As if the dishonesty in the conception of the adult characters was not enough, there is a strong incongruity between the mature, emotional and familiar point of the story and the nonsense that marks the misfortunes of the ""villains"". It just doesn't match the tone of the film. And if the idea was to add a comic conflict to the work, let it be done with the best thing that exists in Despicable Me (along with Agnes' cuteness): The Minions.To take care of the animation, producer Chris Meledandri did not hire hundreds of people. He preferred to keep his small office in Hollywood and work with a third-party animation studio. Meledandri says that this way he will always be able to choose the right people for each project. And seeing what the French at Mac Guff Ligne developed, it's hard to disagree. 3-D uses depth well and, in the roller coaster scene, puts the viewer in the middle of the action, without having to throw anything in the audience's face. And it is also worth waiting until the end, when the minions return to play more with the third dimension.Despicable Me is a fun animation because it has the presence of little yellows and a lovely child, Agnes; but sins in what should be your true identity. The film is indecisive between the silly, the tenderness and the comical, a tightrope that is left aside by spectators more susceptible to scenes classified as ""oooooown! "". It is not a bad movie. It is a very fun piece and with really funny moments, but it ends up being subtracted by the script's flaws.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Despicable Me,"This is the first 2010 animated film I have seen, it was a funny journey for me, first of all, Steve Carrell's funny voice is a main attribution as the protagonist Gru, and his yellow minions are unbelievably cute and adorable, plus three little cherubic girls, it is difficult not to love them.Now Pixar has set up an unsurpassable criterion in front of all animated films, which is a regulatory competition to urge other film studios to elevate the quality of their animated films; another advantage is to broaden the demography and attract more adult spectators to walk into the cinema for an animated work.To cater for the anti-hero trend, the film focuses on a relentless thief aiming to steal the moon to achieve the honor of world's No. 1 thief of the world. With an unexpected intrusion of three organ girls, his scheme is off the track, but don't worry, there will be a happy ending.The design of the character is well-crafted, Since the opening scene of the stolen Egyptian pyramid, the comic atmosphere has hung over all over the film. On the other hand, the villain Victor fail to steal the thunder.I am still eager to watch TOY STORY 3, THE ILLUSIONIST, and HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON, I wish I could always keep an innocent heart to accept excellent animations.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Despicable - no just DIRE !,"This film is TERRIBLE.Ordinarily I wouldn't waste my time even writing a review on trash like this - but - this is supposed to be one of the movies of the moment, movies of the year even. Don't waste your money - It's just dire....It just does not in any way shape or form hang together. Characters, such as they are are pointless creations. There is very little humour in here because the ""story"" (I'm promoting it by suggesting it has a story...) just doesn't work as a vehicle for any gags.I went with my 7 year old - and he got restless. As for me - I fell asleep, and I wasn't woken up by any howls of laughter from the audience.I love animated films of all kinds - so it saddens me to say that Despicable Me is just a DOG of a movie.

Just Awesome,"I have been known to anticipate animated movies, and with there being so many new companies getting into the animation game the selection is becoming wider. Despicable Me is an entertaining story about a not-so-evil evil scientist that tries to pull off the crime of the century by stealing the moon. The trailers told you all of that.This movie has a lot of character to it. The funny scenes that draw you into the movie in the trailers are in the actual movie, and that is a nice surprise. The animation looks like a high-tech animated movie as opposed to trying to make everything look real. That is one of the problems I have always had with the Toy Story franchise. They look too real. There is no shame in making a cartoon look like a cartoon.The acting in this movie, or at least the voice acting, is done very well. New-comer Russell Brand gives life to a very interesting character in Dr. Nefario. The age jokes at Nefario's expense do not seem over-bearing, and anything that leads to boogie-bots cannot be all bad. Let us not forget the dart gun either.I like Steve Carell. He is not always given the best material ( Evan Almighty and 40 Year Old Virgin ), but he manages to turn his roles into something memorable. Carell is reaching the point where I will go see a movie just because he is in it. He is kind of the anti-Will Ferrell of the comedy business.What steals the movie in Despicable Me are the minions. They are the little yellow one-eyed and two-eyed guys you see in the commercials and the trailers. They don't speak English, but that definitely does not lessen their effect. They are fiercely loyal to Gru (Carell's character) and they seem to take his experiments in stride. The minions even dress up and head out to a department store in one of the more memorable scenes in the movie.The thing about this movie is that they do not always go for the one-time quick joke. There are several jokes that run throughout the movie, and that work very well. This is an entertaining movie for adults and children, it delivers entertainment worth the money you spend, it definitely does not drag itself out as new movies seem to and it is most definitely very, very fluffy. Go check this one out, you will not be disappointed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Definitely NOT despicable!,"Had it not been for my 13 year-old cousin's recommendation, as well as general boredom, I would not have thought of seeing Despicable Me. I read some positive reviews, and without knowing much about the film, went and saw it. SO glad I did! I was entertained through the entire movie, and laughed out loud several times (if not more). It may seem like your average, overrated animated feature, but I assure you, it is not. The story line is unique, the voices (particularly Steve Carrell as Gru, the main character) are top-notch, and the animation is just superb. And those little mignons, who I thought would be just an annoying, pointless addition to the film, were so funny and lovable! I loved all 90-some odd minutes of the film- my eyes were glued to the screen. This film can be loved and appreciated by all ages- young, old, and everything in between. Go watch this movie without knowing too much about the plot, or watching too many trailers. I've seen a few movies this year, and I can honestly say that this little animation is easily one of my top favorites of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Classic cartoon slapstick updated for today's young audiences,"It's always nice when a movie surpasses expectations. It's even nicer when that better-than- expected film negates the potential title-related puns that critics could have used to lambaste it. In other words, there's nothing despicable to say about ""Despicable Me"" other than the title's overall irrelevance and potential roadblock to making more money.In a time where the age demographic for animated features isn't confined to under 10 thanks to our friends at DreamWorks and Pixar, one never knows what to expect. ""Despicable Me"" is explicitly for the kiddies, however, with a few under-the-radar adult jokes. Adults will appreciate its cuteness and be generally amused, but Illumination Entertainment's debut film stays mostly slap-happy and goofy, very much so in the tradition of ""Looney Tunes."" In fact, you might even miss ""Looney Tunes"" a bit after this hour and a half of predominantly physical gags where characters walk away from explosions with nothing but soot on their face.Following the trend of superheroes and supervillains pervading family entertainment the last 5-10 years, ""Despicable Me"" focuses on devious Russian-accented supervillain Gru (Steve Carell), who's best known for stealing the Times Square Jumbotron and the statue of liberty - - well, the miniature from Las Vegas. Needless to say, Gru is losing his mojo and to make up for it, he plans to steal the moon. Only problem is, a new rival villain named Vector (Jason Segel) has stolen the shrink ray -- that he stole. Without it, he cannot steal the moon, nor secure the loan he needs from the Bank of Evil to build his rocket ship to get there.That's where the ""Adventures in Babysitting"" part comes in, another all-to-common trend in family entertainment of late. Fortunately, here's another area where ""Despicable Me"" has gone and made it work anyway. Three orphan girls with the unfortunate names of Margo, Edith and Agnes manage to get into Vector's super-secure high-tech hideout right in front of Gru's eyes. He concocts what he thinks to be a brilliant plan: adopt the girls and have them bring Vector robot cookies that will infiltrate and steal back the shrink ray. As you'd expect, the girls become more than he bargained for, and ultimately test his cold, stubborn heart.""Despicable Me"" doesn't necessarily rise above these clichés with a fresh or innovative approach. It merely executes them well and not to excess, never seeming like too much of a kids movie. The yellow pill-shaped minions, for example, while not all that funny or lovable, work well and add a somewhat different dimension to the movie to keep it balanced.The film's plot is irrelevant and stays that way, which is a sign of a film that understands its role as entertainment and executes as such. By selecting simple and predictable narrative patterns, directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud's creativity with the sequences and characters becomes the focus. Arguably, however their ability to not take any moment of the film too seriously makes ""Despicable Me"" work. Considering the tried-and-true physical comedy spread throughout, it definitely takes a certain silliness to make decades-old cartoon tactics work for a modern audience.""Despicable Me"" figures it out and does so without pandering to kids and families, a movie that's age appropriate but not exclusively so.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Not a bad film,"I saw this last night on DVD for the first time as I never seen the film. The film is about a villain who tries to steal the moon and take over the world but when three little girls(Miranda Cosgrove,Elish Fisher and Dana Gould) try to find a place to adopt so he decides to adopt them. At first he doesn't care as he only wanted them for a decoy for Victor(Jason Segal) but he suddenly realizes that being loved is important.I liked the score of this film as its done by Pharell Williams(the dude from N.E.R.D) and the story wasn't bad. Steve Carell was hilarious as he had this German accent and those minions were hilarious. It wouldn't be the best film I have seen but its worth watching if your into James Bond or any villain movies.I'll give it a 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Great voice showcase for Carell's comedic improv,"Despicable Me, from its initial previews, looked kind of, well, lame. Like it wasn't sure what it wanted to be. Was it about good versus evil? The little tots who wind up in almost every scene were barely seen in the initial trailers. So I had sort of dismissed the movie. But that was a wrong decision, as the movie has a lot of heart, terrific voice performances, and a simple, plausible plot that can please both youngsters and cranky old people. And the rest of you.Groo (Steve Carell) is the world's number-one supervillain. He lives in a lair that's beset on all sides by suburbia, and deep within that lair are house his thousands of minions, tiny little alien-looking creatures who serve to live and live to serve. (They sort of remind me of the alien toys from Toy Story.)Groo is a mastermind who has big, big plans – he wants to go to the moon, shrink it, bring it back to earth, and ransom it for untold riches. To do this, he needs a loan from an evil banker (Will Arnett), who won't even talk to him until Groo can produce the needed shrink ray. Meanwhile, Groo isn't the only evil bastard out there, as a new kid on the block named Vector (Jason Segal) is already outdoing him in sheer villainy, having swiped the Great Pyramid of Giza.Vector has the shrink ray, and Groo has a problem. He hits upon a most cynical solution – he'll use orphans! He adopts a trio of little girls (led by Miranda Cosgrove) who have been tasked with selling cookies door to door, and it turns out Vector's ordered a huge batch. Groo sees this as a way into Vector's own lair, thus allowing him to grab the gun and get the loan and shrink the moon and get all the riches in the world! But he doesn't quite count on the girls' charms. It's said that Groo's heart grew (ha, unintended pun) three sizes that day.Carell gives Groo a Slavic/Russian accent that's reminiscent of, among others, Bela Lugosi and Blofeld. The voice and the character are a perfect match, and Carell is terrific as he always seems to be in his voice work. Groo looks like The Penguin, come to think of it, adding another layer of villainy.Anyway, one thing that makes this work is that the shift from Groo as terrifying bad guy to cuddly father figure is slight, slow, and completely believable. Imagine if you hated kids, or at least had no real use for them. Then you do find a use and figure you can discard them later on, only you find it ain't that easy. Never is with kids, is it? The movie could have taken the easier way of having Groo recruit the kidlets to help him in his nefarious scenes, but instead they have him blindly pretend nothing is amiss, that the minions are his cousins, and so on. Subtlety is key.The animation is pretty good, about what you'd expect. It was probably a real hoot to see in 3D, but alas I saw it on my home screen, which is still in 2D and will remain so until the industry has its act together. But even in 2D, it's an exciting, entertaining movie, and it has some 3D-oriented surprises during the end credits.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Well, I don't give a crap what they say, because I really liked this movie!Yes, it wasn't laugh-out-loud funny through the ENTIRE thing, but some jokes did make me giggle, and the others made me smile.

There were jokes that lightened the talking scenes, and made them more interesting to watch. There was also action, from the roller coaster scene, to the flying in the air in Gru's ship, the action scenes were never dull.When have you seen a story where a notorious villain gets his icy heart melted by three adorable orphan girls? I haven't. And I liked it! Gru's transition from cold, calculating villain to kind and compassionate adopted father was one of the most heartwarming things I've ever seen other than the number of Pixar moments that are too many to list out.You people have got to get lose and relax when going to see this movie.

The outrageously visual 'Despicable Me' delivers much fun and heart,"In the CG animation, Despicable Me, a new villain has stolen the Great Pyramid of Giza. Not to be outdone, Gru (Steve Carell), a longtime villain, hoping to uphold his own villainous reputation, plans an even bigger heist—to steal the Earth's moon (with help of a Shrink Ray). In order to do so, he adopts three orphan girls, Margo Edith, and Agnes, to get them to steal the technology from a rival villain, Vector (Jason Segal). However, Gru and the kids start to develop a bond of sorts, which makes him rethink his plans.When I saw this film, it was in 2-D, not the 3-D stereoscopic format, so I will not be able to comment on that particular format. The fluid animation in this film is truly something amazing. This film pretty much proves you can recreate in CG anything a 2-D cartoon is capable of creating (except maybe sketchy lines). The various odd, exaggerated characters with stylized pointy noses, bulging eyes, and expressive mouths that inhabit this zany film are something straight out of TV cartoons-- they all flow, stretch, and exaggerate, all so very organically and naturally. Gone are the stiff-feeling 3-D stuff of yesteryear. The physically impossible feels physically possible because it's so solid-looking. I miss traditional 2-D animation already.I found this film pleasantly charming, cute, diabolically clever, and heartwarming. Admittedly, it is more joke-heavy than plot-heavy. One can easily guess where the story is going and while there are occasional revelations about the characters' past, it doesn't diverge much from the conventional plot. Still, the film's biggest strengths are the outrageous sight gags and the main character, wonderfully voice-acted by Steve Carell. For those who find visually zany gags boring or prefer serious films may find it too goofy for their taste. Still, many adults will find many things to relate to Gru, and kids will relate to the children in the film.Even with his (Eastern European?) accent, Steve Carell's playful humor shines through in the ""despicable"" character of Gru. The character never feels stiff nor less than engaging (unlike the recent Shrek Forever After). Gru may be mean-spirited, but in a charming way. Jason Segel has a great time as Vector, the young, geeky, diabolic rival villain who likes to don warm-up suits, whose every body movement is expressively animated and exaggerated. Much of the ""cute"" elements come from the three orphan girls (Miranda Cosgrove, Dana Gaier, Elsie Fisher) who truly act like how real little girls act with great subtleties in expressions and randomness. The relationship between Gru and the kids never feels cheesy or manufactured, even if you knew it was coming.I loved the look and design. All the characters, the objects, places, and vehicles in this film feel expressively bold and original. Wacky cartoon physics feel effortlessly and seamlessly applied. I loved the attention to detail in this film. The character expressions are wonderful. It is Pixar-level of detail, which is a huge compliment. The film also doesn't rely too heavily on current pop-culture references, which is a big plus.For a film about a villain, it was strange not to see any ""heroes."" Still, I suppose that could have made the film too complex (that'd be something Pixar would do) and would have interfered with Gru's eventual change of heart in the story. Perhaps they'll explore the idea in the sequel. We the audience love Gru because we know that deep inside he's not really evil—he's misunderstood and probably can be rehabilitated after some therapy.As mentioned, the one complaint, if I were to make one, would be the simplicity of the plot, and this is only if I were to compare the film to Pixar's stories (which is an unfair comparison because the film's main focus is different). Despicable Me's story, in its barest form, could possibly fit into a 30 minute episode. However, everything else in this film more than makes up for it. Sure, it's not as thematically deep or complex as Pixar's work, as I tend to walk away from a Pixar film with always something to think about. While Despicable Me may be more joke-driven, have more slapstick, sight gags, and more interested in ""fun,"" with its first rate animation, its crazy humor, its technical achievements, and heartwarming characters, it stands boldly on its own and rivals some of the great CG animations already showcased this year, very closely right up there with Toy Story 3 and How To Train Your Dragon.You can also follow me on http://twitter.com/d_art for more of my reviews.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

It's often a fine line to tread when trying to keep both adults & children entertained, and this movie successfully crosses the tight rope.Plenty of jokes for the adults, ""I said DART gun.... why do you have to be so.... old"" but filled with plenty for the kids: great visual effects, comical yellow henchmen, believable children, an amusement park and more.Some of the action is a little over-the-top, as is quite common in this genre, but there were frequent breaks from the noise with a nice mix of softer, quiet scenes too.

Despicable Me (2010),"It checks off a lot of animated film must-haves. Putting a villain as the lead would be more interesting if he was more villainous. Sure he steals things, pops balloons etc. but he is never totally evil. The closest he gets is simply not caring when he believes a child has died. This is also one of the funniest moments. He's more of an Ebeneezer Scrooge type character, than a fully blown villain. It has enough cute/funny characters to propel it along for an entertaining time, but extract these characters and you wouldn't have much to go on.

Not despicable whatsover!,"""Despicable Me"" is not based on Paris Hilton's autobiography, Saddam Hussein's memoirs, or even BP's 2010 annual report. It is an enjoyable computer-animated film about a criminal mastermind named Gru who adopts three little orphan girls in order to use them to seize his shrinking machine from criminal competitor Vector's home. Gru is a stealer at heart and has stolen many renowned monuments, but his astronomical goal is to steal the moon. His plan is to shrink the moon, so he can steal the moon, and he needs his shrink machine to do that. The three little orphan girls named Margo, Edith, and Agnes are oblivious to Gru's mischievous plan. ""Don't Be Gru to a heart that's true"" probably is an applicable anthem to describe how eventually Gru softens his sturdy persona, and takes a liking to the three little orphans. Gru's criminal entourage includes the meticulous scientist Dr. Nefario voiced by Russell Brand, and the scene-stealers of the film- that adorable army of minions. I could give you a minion reasons just to watch this movie for their sidesplitting antics. Steve Carell sure was no vocal schmuck with his inventive vocal performance as Gru. And Jason Segel also deserves a shout out with his vocal work as Vector. There were hardly any despicable parts of the direction and screenplay of the movie, even though there were some scenes that ran just a bit too long for what it was. But I go back to the minions, so comical and charming. How does one get them? In other words, ""tell me, tell me, how to be, how to be, a Minionaire"".

The settings were brilliant, creative and eccentric as every one should be in a child's movie. I would love to live where they live in this movie. The minions are adorable and hilarious.

The villain of the story (our hero Gru) discovers at a certain point that things are not going his way and finds that there is room in his heart for three girls desperate to be adopted. This point is perhaps the most childish but it serves as a dramatic trigger for an ending where the crazy becomes the norm. The film entertains and facilitates lovable characters in every sense of the word.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Meet GRU,"Wow !!!! Just Wow ! this movie got me interested from it very first trailer..and when I watched it, it was totally worth of my time and money. I enjoyed it from the core and the whole movie made me keep a smile on my face. Meet GRU !!! yeah ! Steve Carell is phenomenal as GRU ! He is wicked yet adorable. And his accent just adds more spice in the character. Hats off to Carell who made this character happen. And how can I forget Agnes !!!! Sweet, cuddly, loving, naughty, innocent..her road to fame starts from her dialog ""Its so fluffy I can die....and ITS DO FLUFFY"". I am out of words to describe this character...no wonder she is my favorite out of the three kids. Jason Segel as Vector and Russell Brand as Dr Nefario are worth a mention.

Superbad. Superdad.,"This is Illumination's first ever animated movie when they were starting out, and then eventually got popular and well-known where it got two sequels plus a fourth one coming soon, and two prequel movies focusing on the Minions; it makes sense why this movie is so well-known, because the movie itself is particularly good. The movie Despicable Me (2010) has well-done 3D animation for the year 2010, quite a few funny moments and memorable lines of dialogue, incredibly good voice acting, and an introduction to the Minions who helped Illumination become as well-known as it is; except to be popular for just merchandise, the Minions are funny in the movie, along with there being some good catchy songs by Pharrell Williams.Steve Carell does a wonderful job voicing Gru making the character a funny and likable character, with going from being a big villain to being a good dad once he adopts three girls for a plan that involves a shrink ray and stealing the moon; I like Gru's progression from wanting to be popular villain again to wanting to be a dad and taking care of the three girls. The three girls Margo, Edith, and Agnes voiced by Miranda Cosgrove, Dana Gaier, and Elsie Fisher are all funny and I like how they warm up to having Gru as their parent, and I like the interactions between Gru and the girls; with Gru helping the girls sell cookies, take them to dance class, and attending their dance recitals. Also, Gru's assistant Dr. Nefario voiced by Russell Brand is helping with Gru's plan to steal the moon and make weapons and vehicles for Gru in the lab with a bunch of the Minions who tend to mess around and screw things up when it comes to following certain instructions or completing a task.The other villain that Gru goes up against is Vector voiced by Jason Segel, who is known as an idiot by how he acts but will do something evil like stealing the Pyramid of Giza; he is a funny, annoying villain that you want to see Gru take down. The 3D animation is well-done, the minions are funny in the scenes they are in, and the action scenes are fun to watch; the look of Gru's lab is cool along with the look of Vector's lair, but also that the weapons used are cool when used and seen put together. Also, the songs by Pharrell Williams are nice to listen to, along with there being quite a few heartfelt moments between Gru and the three girls when they are bonding having more of a father daughters' relationship.The movie Despicable Me (2010) is enjoyable and entertaining to watch, because it has well-done 3D animation, quite a few funny moments and memorable lines of dialogue, and incredibly good voice acting; Illumination did an excellent job with their first movie, though it is not a perfect animated movie, it is still fun to watch for both animation fans and families. This movie is worth watching and rewatching, it makes sense why this would get three sequels and two prequels, because it got the animation studio started and gave us memorable characters, like Gru and the Minions, which made this studio what we know it is today.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Worth watching.,"I saw this film on On-Demand TV, it was recommended by critics to see. After watching this, it was better than TOY STORY 3. It was called DESPICABLE ME. I am not going to give away any plot or detail about this picture, but the character design, like the plot, is great. The sound effects are really cool. The voices are awesome! If you think this film will touch your heart, it will touch your funny bone! I understood all the pop-culture references in this movie. The villain in this movie is funny with a capital F! Most villains in movies are dark and serious and a little witty, but this one takes the cake for being funny. I am sorry this movie got me laughing all the way like non-stop. I highly recommend it. Put that movie on your DVD collection. Family appropriate? Yes! No wonder it was recently airing on such channels as ABC family and Toon Disney. One more thing, the minions (or Twinkies as someone calls them), steal the picture! Followed by DESPICABLE ME 2. Rated PG for crude humor and peril.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Solid Film that Sparked a Franchise,"This was a film that would have come out the year that I graduated from college. I don't remember much there outside of the minions being a thing. Now I watched this with my wife, Jaime. We put this on for our daughter, to see if she would watch it. It held her attention for stretches. I was curious to just see what this was about.The long and short of it is that we are following Gru (voiced by Steve Carell). He is a criminal mastermind. There is a villain out there shrinking and stealing landmarks. Gru has his sights on stealing the moon. This has been his dream since he was a child. He needs a loan from an evil bank but denied due to not having the shrink ray gun. Mr. Perkins (voiced by Will Arnett) is the manager who tells him no. There is a younger criminal, Vector (voiced by Jason Segel), who has a weakness for cookies. Gru sees an opportunity with three orphans, Margo (voiced by Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (voiced by Dana Gaier) and Agnes (voiced by Elsie Fisher), to get what he wants. He also might find something much more fulfilling.What I'll say is that this is a fun, children's movie with a good heart. Gru is cold and part of that is his mother making him feel not good enough while growing up. She is voiced by Julie Andrews. There are things played for laughs here and this is entertaining. It borrows elements there from movies and cartoons of Looney Tunes or Spy vs. Spy or even James Bond. I can appreciate that as I'm fan of all three.Then of course there are the minions. I didn't realize they were voices by Pierre Coffin, Chris Renaud and Jemaine Clement. They're cute, annoying and just fun, I'll be honest. I'm not shocked that they've managed to spawn multiple sequels as well as to get their own movie.I'll say that we have a solid cast of voice actors. I knew Carell was Gru. I picked up quickly that Vector was Segel. I'm a fan of both. I didn't realize that Russell Brand is Dr. Nefario who works with Gru. Andrews doesn't say much and she was one that I didn't pick up. There is also Arnett, Kristen Wiig, Cosgrove, Gaier and Fisher who are all solid. I still can't pick up Coffin, Renaud or Clement so good for them. This also has Jack McBrayer, Danny McBride, Mindy Kaling, Rob Huebel and Ken Jeong. We are mixing the Segel group with the American Office crew which I'm there for.Other than that, I think this is a solid animated film. I'm more partial to the old school style of animation, but this kept me entertained. It is bright and shiny so it also held my daughter's attention which is tricky. Only for short stretches, but we're getting there. I can see why it is as popular as it is. This is just fun in my opinion. Would recommend it as a solid film to watch as a family. There are adult innuendos that are snuck in which I appreciate.My Rating: 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
The Looney Tunes meets a Saturday Morning Cartoon,"Despicable Me is the first feature film for Illumination Entertainment and it was a hit in 2010, a popular film for families and has made the minions a very popular pop culture creation.In a world of sci-fi and supervillains a new villain, Vector (Jason Segal) announces himself by stealing the Great Pyramid of Giza. Gru (Steve Carell), an older supervillain has had his thunder stolen and to reclaim his position as top dog by planning the biggest heist in history, by stealing the moon! But to do this Gru needs a shrink ray and he has formed a rivalry with Vector who steals it off Gru after he stole it from the Chinese. But Gru is not a villain who could be kept down for long and plans to steal the shrink ray by adopting three orphan girls, the sharp witted Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), the tomboyish Edith (Dana Gaier) and the innocent Agnes(Elsie Kate Fisher). Despite Gru's ambitions he slowly starts to warm to the girls.Despicable Me is basically a cross between a Saturday morning cartoon and the Looney Tunes. The film has the design of a Saturday morning cartoon, the lair, the weapons, the design and the plot. Many of the designs of the vehicles and the weapons were overblown and felt like something a 10-year-old boy would create, and I am saying that as complement. There is a clear influence from Pixar's The Incredibles in its design and the music which borrows some Bond ques and basic set up and there are some parallels to Megamind (which was released in the same year) about a villain who finds his good side.The style of humour is very physical and visual: there are plenty of slapstick humour, particularly involving the minions and their bickering and the experimentations on them. One great example is early on in the film is when Gru tries to break into Vector's home/lair which looked like it could have been a Looney Tune short. There are some verbal jokes and The Bank of Evil offers the only real cultural/political joke.The script itself is screen writing 101, the structure is predictable and Gru is a typical character who a dream he thinks he wants (i.e. stealing the Moon) and what he really wants is a family. His dream during the film changes as he realises what is really important to him. The film does do a good job at setting up why going to the Moon is so important to Gru and it is more then just make a name for himself.Like most animated films these days Despicable Me has a big name cast. Carell was solid as Gru, giving him an ambiguous Eastern European actor. He gave us a character who does changes during the film. Russell Brand was surprising good as Gru's scientist and friend, his voice was unrecognising and he was funny throughout. There are strong supporting characters played by Kristen Wigg and Will Arnett but Segal was a disappointment as he felt like he was just playing teenage Marshall from How I Met Your Mother. Also Julie Andrews' casting as Gru's mother was pointless seeing she was only in the film for three screens.The girls were very well defied with the personality and felt more like real children in the context of this world. This is especially the case for Margo as she acts as the leader of the girls but still acts as a child when she is around Gru. But I would have thought Edith would want to take her hat off sometimes.Despicable Me is a fun and enjoyable film for the whole family. There is plenty of slapstick humour and fun designs and whilst it is a simple affair it does not patronises children.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

All the pieces work well together in this energetic film,"Despicable Me is a movie about a villain trying to make a name for himself and stand above the younger generation of villains. Illumination created a name for themselves with this movie and it's a lot of fun.The Protagonist is very likable and carries the entire movie on his shoulders. The story is very predictable but presented with energetic characters and a certain sweetness. Dialogue is tight and pacing is quick so the movie is never boring.The setting of Gru's house is excellent but almost all other visuals feel boring aesthetically. The animation isn't bad but it's definitely a bit generic. I found the minions very bland and even annoying sometimes, but they will be very popular among certain audiences and I can't deny their popularity.Overall, Despicable Me is a great movie that shines because of Gru and the voice cast. There's something for every audience here and although it's simple there are no reasons why one can't enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Now, the Minions are a real funny lot. They look funny, talk funny, and even laugh funny.","Directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud have made the third best animated film of the year thus far after Toy Story 3, and How to Train Your Dragon. I may sound consolatory, but I am putting things into perspective. Despicable Me is a very good animated film, but the quality of Pixar's and DreamWorks' outputs this year remain unsurpassed. But then again, if 2010 serves up another animated feature that is every bit as delicious as Despicable Me, I will have no complains.Written by Ken Daurio (Horton Hears a Who!, 2008), Despicable Me is a story about a deplorable man called Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) who dreams of stealing the Moon by shrinking it using a shrink ray. A villain at heart, Gru is cold, calculating, and hates children. Together with Dr. Nefario, and an army of cute, yellow, goggle-wearing technicians called Minions, Gru attempts to build a rocket that will fly him to the Moon to commit the ""crime of the century"".Enter three innocent orphans, Margo, Edith, and Agnes, who are ""adopted"" by Gru to be part of a plan to steal the shrink ray from an arrogant young villain named Vector, whose fortress house is almost impenetrable. Despicable Me is a comedy-adventure that allows us to witness the thawing of Gru's cold heart as the three orphans find their way into his life, which until their arrival has been a perpetual lonely and emotionally unsatisfying existence.As much as the film is about the transformation of a despicable and aggressive man into one that is gentle and caring, it is also quite a cheeky portrayal of the ""greed and (over)ambitiousness of Man"". This can be seen in the context of the film where villains are able to get funding for their evil projects from the Evil Bank (formerly known as Lehmann Brothers in a clever if-you-blink-you-will-miss-it moment).Despicable Me is generally engaging and the main reason for this is its high humor quotient, of which it relies quite extensively on farcical visual gags and near-incomprehensible verbal banter by the Minions. Now, the Minions are a real funny lot. They look funny, talk funny, and even laugh funny. Their interactions with each other, Gru, Dr. Nefario, and the three orphans are indisputably the film's scene-stealers. In fact, the animation, which I feel is on par with Pixar's, is unfortunate to be outshined by the Minions.Despicable Me is ninety minutes well-spent. Even though it is not as emotionally wrenching as Toy Story 3, nor is it adventure in its purest incarnation as presented in How to Train Your Dragon, this Coffin/Renaud effort is still a very well-made film. The Minions are so hyperactively addictive that a sequel will be more welcomed than not. Enjoy.SCORE: 8/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Enjoyable and Cute,"I admit, I'm not the biggest fan of the current CG animated style, and based on that, outside of the occasional Pixar film, I don't always give new animated films a chance. I know I shouldn't think this way, but part of me can't help but lament the move away from the classic cel animation of the Disney era. I'm here to say this is one of the films I was wrong for neglecting.I won't describe the plot, but once you read it for yourself it's pretty easy to see what direction the movie is headed in. Sadly, it's nothing new, but does that mean the film is not worth seeing at all? Absolutely not.The film has a lot of laughs, and is also really cute, both the little girls and Gru's minions. Steve Carell does a good job here, and the voice actors for the kids are endearing. If there's one thing that I didn't like, something that tends to bug me in any animated movie, are the dance numbers to some techno/hip hop beat. There's a couple here, and yes they're bright and whimsical and kids will no doubt enjoy them, but I never really saw the point in them. I'm sure there's another joke that could be used in it's place, but it's not hugely detrimental to the film.All in all, I'm happy I finally got around to watching this film. It was funny, cute, and I'll probably end up seeing the sequel on opening night.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Better than Pixar's Latest Efforts,"""We stole the Statue of Liberty...the small one, from Las Vegas!""Considering Despicable Me 2 was coming out this weekend I finally decided to watch the first film and I wasn't disappointed. Despicable Me is a lot of fun with some memorable characters and some really funny lines. The story is involving enough for adults and kids to enjoy it alike, and Steve Carell has done some magnificent voice work with his character. I had a great time with this film and was instantly delighted with the animation and the storyline. Despite having some great characters, I think the minions completely stole the show and deliver several laugh out loud moments throughout the film. Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud have directed an entertaining enough film for me to want to go watch the sequel at the movies as soon as possible. This is a great family-friendly film that is better than Pixar's latest three movies so they should begin to worry with this strong competition. The characters in this film were just so much fun to watch on screen that it makes it impossible for anyone to walk out of the movie without a smile on his or her face. I had a blast.The film stars a super villain named Gru (Steve Carell) who has a very long and pointed nose along with skinny legs. After discovering that a pyramid in Egypt has been stolen by another villain, Vector (Jason Segel), he decides to do something greater out of jealousy. He plans to steal the moon, and in order to do so he first has to shrink it with a special weapon. The only problem is that this weapon is in hands of Vector. So Gru comes up with an idea involving adopting three orphans and using them to get into Vector's fortress in order for him to get the weapon back. Thus he adopts the adorable girls: Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Gaier), and Agnes (Elsie Kate Fisher). Everything seems to be going according to plan as his workers known as the minions and Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) are preparing everything for the great day, but the only problem is that Gru's heart begins to be softened by these sweet girls. He realizes he still has to face his greatest challenge yet.Despicable Me is without a doubt a family pleaser. If you have kids you will want to go see this movie with them because the entire family will be entertained. It is funny and smart, a combination that is difficult to find these days. The premise also felt original and despite a few moments it never felt formulaic or cliché. This is what I would call a very cute film, and these days cute sells to audiences. I'm kind of upset I didn't get to see this film in 3D because the animation was excellent and it really did feel like a Pixar film. I may not have been as emotionally engaged as I was with Up, The Lion King, or How to Train Your Dragon, but this was still a lot of fun and I felt like I was being tickled like a 5 year old.

It met all my expectations - the animation is great, the characters are great, and it's easy to see why it satisfied audiences of all ages and not just kids.However, drawing comparisons to other animated movies, 'Despicable Me' isn't one I'll revisit in a hurry. Not because I didn't enjoy it, but because it lacks that special something that makes the very best animated movies memorable and timeless.I expected 'Despicable Me' to entertain and it certainly did.

Despicable Me was only mildly entertaining as a 3-D computer animated flick,"Unlike the other summer computer animated movies I've seen, Toy Story 3 and, yes, Shrek Forever After, Despicable Me was sort of blah for me. Yes, Steve Carell is pretty amusing as the voice of the leading character and seeing that character in scenes with his minions, those three orphan girls, and some others I won't mention provided some good laughs. And it's also amusing recognizing Julie Andrews as his mother while I couldn't place Kristen Wiig or Jason Segel until after the credits which was a nice surprise for me. And the 3-D effects are awesome as usual. But the story wasn't tight enough and seemed to rely too much on cuteness to provide much comic bite. Not to mention I was fighting sleep during the middle part. So in summation, Despicable Me was mildly entertaining but didn't totally hit it out of the ball park for me like the other two computer animated movies I mentioned at the beginning of this review.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Good way to remember 2010,"Despicable me - Review My Rating - 4/5I don't know from where Hollywood gets their ideas from but they sure is awesome some times. One of the good example is 'Despicable Me'. Imagine a world where thieves are so sophisticated and think of stealing pyramids and ultimately the moon. And guess what? There is a bank who give loans to the thieves with big stealing projects. How convenient!!! The crazy as it may sounds that was few interesting pieces from 'Despicable Me' .Gru (Steve Carell) is a thief with big dreams and want to steal the moon. And he got a rival as well. That's Vector (Jason Segal) the guy who just stole the pyramids from Egypt. While Gru trying to steal one important piece of his plan to steal the moon from Vector, he plot to use 3 sweet orphan girls(And some cookie robots) to do it for him. But that's where he finds to liking them more than he should be and the moon stealing plan gets a twist.Filled with unique and surprisingly funny and interesting characters to watch, 'Despicable Me' does a good job. The plot is unique, Animation is fantastic, voice acting is hilarious so what else can you actually expect to be right. (Specially the yellow little helper 'things' called Minions in the Gru's lab are bizarrely hilarious)I have seeing the best of 2010 animation so far and glad to wrap up with 'Despicable Me'.

The Vidiot Reviews...,"Despicable MeWhen you steal the moon, you run the risk of pissing off surfers, werewolves, and flag- planting Americans – which makes it the perfect plan to propel the villainous Gru (Steve Carell) into the bad guy stratosphere.After being bested by a new heavy, Vector (Jason Segel), Gru is compelled to up the ante by purloining the planetoid known as the moon. Unfortunately, he cannot obtain a bank loan for his scheme until he secures a shrink ray, which his younger and richer rival has just stolen.In order to retrieve said device, Gru employs three orphans (Miranda Cosgrove, Dana Gaier, Elsie Fisher), who turn the tables and end up challenging him to be a better man.Teeming with toddler, teen and tall people tomfoolery, Despicable Me is a rib tickler, especially the primrose yellow pellets called Minions.And if the moon is ever stolen, owls will have to get day jobs.

"""Despicable Me"" has some bursts of brilliance and originality, but it is an overall undernourished film. Kids will like it, though","The magic of Pixar's movies (the ""Toy Story"" franchise, ""Monsters Inc."", ""Finding Nemo"") is that they care. They really do. They care about film and they care about their audiences. They do not just assume that because their intentions are good that the movie will work. They make sure they work. And if Universal Pictures is to make their next animated film better the the near-wholly unsatisfying ""Despicable Me,"" they are going to have to keep that in mind. This is a family entertainment picture with good intentions, splendid animation, some wit, and some genuine laughs. But when compared with the plethora of recent great animated family features, ""Despicable Me"" is a pretty heavy letdown.Almost every adult in ""Despicable Me"" has a vague resemblance to an animal. Gru (voice of Steve Carrell) is a hunchbacked would-be villain with a face like a frog - if you'll excuse his elongated, pointy nose. His assistant is an old doctor hard on the hearing (voice of Russell Brand) who resembles an age-worn owl. He also has an army of jelly bean-like minions at his service. Anyway, whatever. Gru is jealous of another villain's feat and wants to commit the ultimate theft: stealing the moon. The plot thickens and Gru ends up adopting three little orphans in order to accomplish his task. But, as you'd expect, when a hardheaded curmudgeon takes little kids into his house, he starts to soften up.I think the movie's death culminated, for me, with the arrival of the three little girls. Why was that? Because instead of being cute, funny, and lovable - instead of making me want to hug them - they came across as unctuous, irritable, and utterly devoid of depth. They are like the annoying little kids down the street whom I never socialized. I never learned anything about them except that they could drive me up the wall in a heartbeat and that I never wanted to learn anything more about them other than that fact. The girls are separated by a few years and the older they get, the more annoying they get.But they are not the movie's only problem. Gru has his moments as a funny character (credit Steve Carrell's mastery of humor) and his interludes with the old-as-dirt doctor and his gullible little minions are (most of the time) very funny, they simply are neither frequent enough nor fresh enough. Apart from that, there is simply not an energetic enough story to keep interest. The movie whips along at a fast clocking time, but more like somebody racing to get out of the doctor's office, not racing an exciting marathon. Gru has nemeses which include another hack-villain with a fetish for guns and aquatic creatures and a jowled bank manager with a vague resemblance to Dilbert's pointy-haired boss. These subplots never go into or out of anywhere and potentially great jokes are wasted.Now there *are* some hilarious individual moments in ""Despicable Me."" There are bursts of gut-busting humor. However, the unfortunate reason why it does not work is because the rest is really quite a bore. It's innocent, harmless, and will not affont anybody. And the kids will more than likely enjoy it. When the movie was released earlier this year, I dropped my sister and her friend off and went and saw Angelina Jolie in ""Salt."" In hindsight, having seen the movie at home, I commend my own decision. It just did not work for me. And I think there's a scene in the movie which parallels my exact reaction throughout most of the picture. The other hack-villain picks up his shotgun which shoots out squids (not kidding). He outlays his plan - a potential moment for humor - and the squid rolls his eyes.""Puh-lease!"" thought the squid. ""Puh-lease!"" thought me.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Touching, sentimental and heartbreaking :)","Despicable Me is one of a few animated movies I really have no excitement to watch at all. Another one for me is ""How to Train your dragon"". This probably may be due to their uninteresting titles to my liking. Anywho, I cannot imagine not to watch them more than once afterwards.First off, Despicable Me does have a number of dark and crude jokes mixed with sentimental moments among the characters. I feel for those poor little girls: Margo, Edith and Agnes for being orphans and residing at the orphanage owned by ""Miss Hatties"". This reminds me of the movie named ""Meet the Robinsons"" (2007) at which the protagonist is an orphan too.The pace of this movie is very fast and the heart-melting process is as powerful. For a record, I love how this process slowly creeps into Gru's heart. I am amazed how Supervillain can live in harmony with those 3 girls and even changed his attitude towards life.To wrap up, I would regret not watching this movie because it is simply phenomenal, eye-opening and wonderfully inspirational. It makes me aware more of those desperate orphans waiting to be adopted. I could see how normal kids with moms and dads can be proud of themselves and live the moment for their future with better chance and faith than those 3 little girls. Lastly, the soundtracks by Pharrell and scores by Hans Zimmer have a strong impact on how one may experience and consume this movie with greater excitement. They are all well-composed and suited to every single scenes appearing in the movie. In particular, I love the unique scores for 3 little girl's and vector's appearances. They are simply thoughtful of the movie producer.Cheers,",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

"Despicable Me, a very, very  funny movie!!","I watched this film for the first time on DVD last week and i found it to be an absolutely hilarious and entertaining film for people of all ages to enjoy. It is about this lovely house which is in a suburban neighbourhood but unknown to the neighbours, there is something hidden underneath this home which is a secret hideout. The hideout is completely surrounded by a small army of little creatures called minions, who are looked after by a strange man called Gru that is planning to steal something very precious. I really loved the character of Gru who is completely armed with his collection of arsenals to enable him to get rid of anybody who happens to get in his way!. One day he meets three little orphaned girls called Margo, Edith and Agnes, that would like Gru to be there dad. The film was so great that i could not stop watching throughout the movie. I found the little girl in the film to be very cute and funny!.I could not stop laughing at times!. Kids will really love this film and i also recommend it to adults as well, as there are some very funny parts in the film!. I thought that this was one of the best animation films that i have ever seen!: My Rating 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"fast-paced, colorful and inventive","Gru, a Russian-born inventor and thief, desperate to be known as the number one villain on the planet, comes up with a scheme to steal the moon and hold it for ransom – all with the help of an army of cylinder-shaped minions he made himself. But Gru's life is eventually turned around after he adopts three adorable tykes whom he initially intends to make unwitting participants in his diabolical plan but who, instead, wind up making him question his own commitment to a life of crime.Directed by Peter Coffin and Chris Renaud, ""Despicable Me"" is a colorful, witty and fast-paced animated feature that has just the right amount of humor, sentiment and moral lessons to make it a well-balanced treat for children and oldsters alike. The frequent and exciting action sequences also make this ideal viewing for those with deficient attention spans (which seems to include just about all of us these days). The design of the characters is clever and amusing, and the voice work – by Steve Carrell, Will Arnett, Jason Segel, Russell Brand, and a virtually unrecognizable Julie Andrews - is excellent as well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Very colourful,This film has a very bright and colourful feel that makes it more suited for younger children. The gags are all very visually imaginative. The story is interesting as it is about a group of orphan children finding acceptance in themselves (though this message is undermined by the sequels).,7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Despicable Me, cutest movie of 2010","Possibly the cutest movie I ever seen. I always just thought this was just going to be another animated comedy but, it was a terrific movie. With Steve Carell leading a team of other great actors like Will Arnet, Miranda Cosgrove, Jason Segal, and Russel Brand really put the movie in a great spot to become a close to perfect movie. The character that I think that will capture every one's heart is Agnes played by Elsie Fisher. Another thing that was a key factor in the film was the little yellow minions, they are also pretty cool. Steve Carell is also the main factor because without him this movie wouldn't have come about. So just to give a rating out of 10 I would give it a 8.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

The only decent Illumination flick,"Illumination is infamous for making the most uninspired and mediocre animation movies of this time. But at least, their first try, wasn't really bad.
Despicable Me is a mildly fun, innofensive, well animated kids movie.
Some bits are boring, maybe five minutes less could help.
The minions are not as annoying as they would be in the future, yet they are undoubtedly the worst part of the movie.
Steve Carell does a good job, his character is entertaining, and his arc, though a little forced, is convincing.
Quite watchable, but you can find much better animation movies to see.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Clever 3D Funny movie,"Despicable Me's teasers and trailers seemed to represent a few different movies, and that's reflected by the general segregation of comedy styles that the film begins with. At the film's start, Gru (Steve Carrell) handles the dark comedy, the trio of orphans get the cutesy comedy, and the minions handle the slapstick. As the film progresses, though, these lines begin to blur, building to a strong emotional finale and a satisfyingly complete tale. (This is one of those rare non-Pixar animated films that doesn't seem destined for sequel-Dom.) The tale of rival villains isn't terribly original. Nor is the idea of a villain having his heart melted by adorable children. But the way Despicable Me blends these two ideas is just fantastic. There's humor, action, and heart -- what more could you want from an animated film? Also notable is the way the star-studded voice cast handles their characters. While there are a ton of big names filling out the roster, most of them use accents which render them familiar but not too much so. It's a different route than many animated films take, and it's refreshing. Julie Andrews and Steve Carrell especially do well at straddling the line between their trademark voices and their characters' accents. The voice that steals the movie, however, is the adorable Elsie Fisher as Agnes. Almost every line gets either a laugh or an ""Aw..."" (On a related note, I love that the orphan girls are named Edith, Margo, and Agnes. I love old names for young people.) The plot has enough twists and turns to keep things interesting, and the antics of the minions provide a nice side of fun to the proceedings. Also, their reaching contest during the credits is a fun use of 3-D that had the kids in the theater reaching for the screen.Last year was a banner year for animation, and this year seems to be following suit. How to Train Your Dragon amazed, Toy Story 3 is one of the best animated films of all time, and Despicable Me impresses. A very pleasant surprise.Evren Buyruk",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

very enjoyable animated movie,"This is one of those animated movies that adults along with kids will enjoy. It is cute and funny and has a decent plot. The opening is great with how we learn the pyramid had been stolen: a brilliant idea. Then we meet super villain, Gru, whom needs to come up with an idea to top the pyramid napping. He is planning to steal the moon and hold it for ransom. To do this, he needs a shrink ray, which nerdy villain, Vector, has stolen from him. Gru adopts 3 cute girls in order to use them as a distraction to get the shrink ray back. But of course, being around the girls begins to change Gru and he begins to enjoy their company and being a dad. So, there are many cute scenes with the girls, like the fun park, the bedtime story, playing with the minions. Eventually, Gru must choose the girls or the moon and have a final battle with Vector, before realizing what's most important in the end.FINAL VERDICT: Very funny, and entertaining.

The film that launched a thousand memes,"Despicable Me: 9 out of 10: Yes the movie that started an industry larger than some small nations GDPs Despicable Me is better remembered for what it launched than as a stand-alone movie itself. And that is a bit of a shame.Despicable Me has one thing that none of the sequels had. A true villain. No, not the antagonist Vector I am talking about Gru. Gru, for at least the first half of this film, is a proper bad guy. When one of the girls apparently is crushed in a torture device Gru's reaction is that his scheme will still work with two of them. This, of course, gives Gru a proper character arc in this film which leads to taking out the tissues at the end. (Why is it always kids movies that start the waterworks with me).The rest of the film is also top notch with the minions ( Yes a slightly less obnoxious version of Ubisoft's Rabbids) fully formed and delightful, Gru's evil cohorts delightful and a macabre world that seems to live just on this side of an Addam's family cartoon. The three girls are well drawn (character wise) with distinct and easily recognizable personalities and the whole story is some nice slapstick silliness with great call outs for the parent's in the room (That Godfather reference was particularly well placed)Overall a great start to what ended up being a fun franchise that never was quite as good as its first outing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Not a despicable movie to watch,"We watched Despicable Me as a class the other day. To the surprise of the class it was my first time. As we are all over the age of 20 it was to my surprise that all of them HAD.I am not always one to select an animated film as I feel I am more into action or suspense, however I must admit, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I smiled a lot, laughed frequently and even cried a little, learning that adults too can enjoy animated movies. It needs to be this way as children are drawn to watch animated movies and the adults are the ones who accompany the children when they go to watch the movies. There was lots of humour and ""silly"" parts which did not seem silly as it is animated and all is possible in animation.Animated movies always accompany morals or life lessons and there are many you can gain from this film for example: family should stick together, nothing with great magnitude can be accomplished alone, when you give to others, you will receive, don't give up, and more! however I do not want to give spoilers as to how!",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"great movie, one of the best modern kids films","I know this review came late, but to let you know I did see it when it came out. Steve Carrel plays a villain named Gru. Who with many others find out that a pyramid is stolen. He goes to this really hidden bank where he revels his plans to steel the moon. Meanwhile, three girls from an orphanage are adopted by Gru. in the middle of this a villain named Vector (Steve Carrel) who also plans on steeling the moon. Its a race between the 2 to see who gets the moon first. (It reminds me a lot of the space race for some reason) What I like about the movie is the characters, the writing and some of the jokes were funny. And there was hidden adult jokes a plenty. It feels like a Disney movie because of the emotion but it also has its own style. which I think is cool, you don't see that a lot in animated movies. My only problem is that it does get tiresome after watching it 10 times. If you give it 6 months or so it's fine. It left an impression on everyone. kids and adults.

Anyway, the movie is good, the animation cgi or whatever it is called still holds up, the only thing that might annoy you is the minions look. They are more pale and something's off about them. Despite that the rest of the movie is pleasing to see, and remains fun. It also shows to kids that no matter how despicable you are, you can always redeem yourself. Good message to spread out there.

Not Much to Say,"It's just good.Supervillain Gru adopts a trio of female orphans for nefarious purposes and they all grow attached to each other by the end of the movie.The animation is spectacular. You can tell from the very first scene where one of the Gizan pyramids turns into a trampoline that they really milked everything they could out of the CGI.There are genuinely funny moments, the emotional trajectory of the protagonist quartet is well-developed, and the setting where supervillains have their own banks and well-developed societal infrastructure is funny to see.Not everything is done well. You won't find anything that hasn't been done here, even though the standard fare is served up skillfully. Of course it's a children's movie so expect a lot of inane musical numbers and a shallow plot. The little girls are sometimes obnoxious, violent, and rude, too, yet just real enough that they seem realistic. That is to say, they're not the best of role models or extremely sympathetic characters.Honourable Mentions: Looney Tunes (1930 - 1969). The pacing and slapstick style of this film is in the spirit of the Looney Tunes cartoons. The whole ambiance is very reminiscent of a Roadrunner cartoon where the villains keep developing complex plans to accomplish outrageous goals but keep getting thwarted and frustrated by simplistic obstructions.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A great Start for a smawl Minion,"So, i was recently rewatching Despicable Me and this Movie is having a lot Things which i miss seeing in nowadays Movies, and since i rediscovered myself reviewing Movies and Shows in my free Time, did i wanted to put my Experience in here, just to see if People might be agreeing with me or not.First of all: Can we start talking about how every Character is showing so many diffrent Sides of them and how Gnu is trying to give those Girls a Home and to feel like Home? This overwhelmed my Heart quickly with the cute little Minions running arround doing cute and funny Things while happing to stick the Family together and creating for the most funny Scenes which i ever saw in Movie History?I also love that you can see that all of those Characters had their Diffrences with each other and how they started to grow for each other or how Gnu is changing from a bad Boss which is threating the Minions badly to a Family Dad which is still threating their Minions like badly.I really enjoyed the Movie and it brings up good old Memories.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Truly a Masterpiece,"This movie is relevant to the current state of rising racial tensions in S. Africa.

With that being said, I gave this movie a perfect rating because it caused me to think. It had a strong impression on me, causing me to think about the meaning of the current state of what's happening in the world. Sure, I still have to get up & live my life but the truth is that we ALL have hurt someone or done worse but at the end of the day, it's realizing our mistakes & thinking about the effect it has on other people. I'm very aware that things arent that cut & dry but at the same time they really are. I enjoy a cheap piece of entertainment once in awhile to take my mind off things but this kind of movie is getting harder to come across & deserves recognition. I've seen others comments about this movie starting out slow & then ending with a bang or picking up....that's life. It welcomes you in & then spanks you.

"A clever, colorful, high-tech animated comedy","It all starts with Gru, an eager villain who couldn't quite feel the love until he felt the joy of being an ""uncommon"" parent. With a bunch of hilarious animated humor, gizmos, and a frolicking adventure, the movie never tends to sit still except for most of the heart-felt scenes that includes an ending that is most touching almost since Toy Story. This film also includes oddly-shaped, but well thought out characters such as Gru himself, the smart but hilarious arch nemesis known as Vector, the three girls, and of course the minions. When it comes to my specific opinions, the minions may be a bit overrated, but they are just about as funny to watch. Gru is easily my favorite character as he is voiced by one of the top-most comedians Steve Carell.

Despicable Me better Than i expected :),"Despicable Me better Than i expected, Steve Carell lends his voice to Gru, a self-professed evil genius, however, it becomes blatant that he's kind-hearted beneath it all.

He takes in three orphans in a bid to involve them in his next evil plan.While the whole script is funny, it seems the writers gave Agnes the best jokes, which result in side-splitting laughter.And here's why. It is incredibly rare to see a single dad portrayed in such a positive light.

The biggest question for me, is why did I see this movie?In all seriousness, this is a kiddy movie, and very good for small children if you have them. But that's where it's value ends.

A great entry into the Despicable Me franchise,"I went into this thinking it was going to follow the same recipe as ""Megamind"" (both movies came out in 2010, albeit ""Megamind coming out before ""Despicable Me"" to my knowledge) but the only similarity between those two movies is that the MC is a villain and got minions that's pretty much it. This made each movie unique in their own ways but now that i've watched the ""Megamind"" movie and the whole ""Despicable Me"" franchise, I can say hands down, this movie takes the crown. I just enjoyed every aspect of this way more, despite of how star-studded the cast of ""Megamind"" was. The comedy was funnier, the plot, the emotional scenes, those damn annoying minions who somehow both gets on my nerves but also manages to give me a few chuckles along the way. Will Ferrell did an outstanding job as the voice of Gru, Russell Brand as Nefario, Jason Segel as Vector and ofc whoever voiced the minions did great too.

I left the theater loving it and thinking ""I am so gonna buy this when it gets on DVD"" and sure enough, I got it for Christmas with an inflatable minion. This movie had an all-star cast and they all gave their best performances!Steve Carrell as Gru-Steve did an amazing job with a fantastic accent. His acting was splendid and his character was really something. Gru's Best Lines: ""You have to be pulling on my leg!"" ""We stole the statue of liberty! The small one from Las Vegas!""Jason Segal as Vector-Vector was by far the best character! Vector is just a nerd who can do big things. Thank goodness Vector is a super villain or else he would be a target of every kind of bully imaginable. Jason Segal had the right voice and everything for Vector. Best Vector Lines: ""A little tiny toilet for a little tiny baby to- AAHH! Curse you tiny toilet!"" ""NO I'M NOT PLAYING WITH IT!""Miranda Cosgrove as Margo-Miranda has the perfect voice to play Margo and the right attitude. She is the only person they could have picked to pull of this character. She says all these witty things that only a Margo could say. She takes care of her sisters and is a great character to the story. Best Margo Line: ""What about the air? Can we touch the air?""Dana Gaier as Edith-Edith is a ruffian and just awesome. She is the tough one out of the three orphans and she is the one who has many funny moments. I think Dana did an excellent job playing her, she had a perfect voice to fit Edith's rough personality. Best Edith Lines: ""Oops"" ""It poked a hole in my juice box"" ""What? I'm just walking""Elsie Fisher as Agnes-Elsie was really cute and adorable in this movie. Its hard to believe a girl this little could voice a character just as good as veteran actors such as Steve Carrell and Russell Brand. Most everyone knows her for her funny lines. Elsie Fisher is going to become a BIG star one day, mark my words. Best Agnes Lines: ""Does this count as annoying?"" ""Its so fluffy I'm gonna die!"" ""IT'S SO FLUFFY!"" ""My unicorn! You have to fix it!""Russell Brand as Dr. Nefario-I was surprised when I heard Russell Brand played a super old guy. He didn't seem like his voice could pull off old. I will admit he did the worst acting in the movie but still a GOOD performance. His character was interesting, I guess. Best Dr. Nefario Lines: ""BOOGIE!"" ""I was wondering under what circumstances would we need this?""Kristen Wiig as Miss Hattie-Funny stuff! Every scene with Miss Hattie in it was funny and enjoyable. She had a great accent and such a funny personality. She seemed Despicable and desperate. Kristen Wiig did a great job as Miss Hattie and whoever did casting, I would pick them if I was making a movie. Kristen Wiig was perfect. Best Miss Hattie Lines: ""Look at my face!

""Go clean something of mine""Julie Andrews as Gru's Mom-Julie Andrews is too sweet to play such a Despicable woman. She crushed her son's dreams and laughed.

From supervillain to super-dad/hero,"Gru starts off being the greatest criminal mastermind in the world. But his life changes when he meet those three girls who want him to adopt.

Fantastic,"This is a fantastic movie. In animated series, its well made, god humour and very nicely presented.Storyline: Gru is a person who wants to be the greatest villain and the movie is about him trying to achieve his goal. His companions: a scientist called Dr.Nefario and Minions. ! Minions are the best part of the movie for certain. They do everyday stuff but are not humans. Personally, I think its a very fresh concept and works very well.In the process, he(gru) meets 3 orphans and slowly gets attached to them. Telling more about this might be ruining the fun of the movie for first timers. The little girls are very cute, and very adorable. Its literally cuteness overloaded and that has a major part.In my opinion, its a fantastic movie(a must watch I can say). I should stress its not only for kids but for adults too ! Go and have fun !",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A lesson for bad dads (Screen),"This is it.I think this movie was my last screening with the kid due to the choices of his narcissus mother (and my failures to open the talk about this). But for the last movie, the story was symbolic: how a bad man can turn into a great daddy by realizing that kids are the most precious gifts that life can give? I know that the real father of the kid promised him to watch it together but he failed as always to his words (maybe he read the summary and understood clearly that this movie could be a dangerous experience for him).Thus, the ""bragging"" friend (this is me) didn't hesitate to offer this opportunity to the kid, all the more than it was his first 3D movie. Remembering him trying to hold the picture between his hands will remain as a fondest memory forever.To be honest, the kid and I didn't know both that the movie was about fatherhood and that's why I found the beginning of the movie a bit slow and dull. But the click happened at the funfair: it was a great idea to put rides on a 3D movie because you can feel similar feelings as the real ones. Then, it was moving to see Gru torn between his duty and his responsibility as a father. This moral lesson was really the heart of the movie and it's far better told than the scary ""Toy Story 3"".Visually, the character design is poor, uninspired and it's unfortunate because it diminishes the power of the story! As for the kid, I don't know if watching a cartoon Dad standing up for his kids wake him questions because this is a territory that i have always forbid me to enter. I just hope that he will get a loving Daddy like Gru soon!",4.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Incredible,"What does this movie not have? It's light and fun and has surprising heart. Endless laughs, creative gags and a totally unique storyline. The funny scenes are a romp, the heartfelt scenes are warming and there's a constant stream of incredible voice acting. Each scene oozes with charm. It's a must watch for adults and children alike.(PS, This is the only film in which the minions aren't overwhelmingly irritating)",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Cute and fun for all of the family,"Despicable Me was Illumination's first film and they proved that Dreamworks was not Pixar and Disney's big competitor now. In the 1st quarter I was confused and kind of turned off by the film. In the second quarter I was starting to feel the appeal, the minions were hilarious. Vector really did break the movie for sure, he was so unlikable. In the 3rd quarter things started to pick up and I was liking it even more. By the 4th quarter I knew that it was good. Despicable Me was the cozy not over the top animated movies that we've been waiting for years to see 1st quarter 6.5/10 2nd quarter 7/10 3rd quarter 8/10 4th quarter 8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
The beginning of a pop culture phenomenon,"Often quite funny, and surprisingly heartfelt- Despicable Me is one of the few animated films that made me break down and cry. As Illumination rose from out of the depths of nowhere and began to take over the animation industry with its somewhat cheap and played out gags- many audience members grew tiresome of films like these and began to bash them for its quality. Although I do feel that can definitely be said about a few of the films this company has produced, Despicable Me being their first and perhaps most notable film is thankfully a great exception to that statement. Now, is Despicable Me as great as some may have said it was when it came out? No, but is it horrible as some may say now- no, not at all. It's hardly the best animated film of 2010, let alone a classic to be held among the likeliness of Toy Story or Shrek. And yet, its nearly impossible (especially in american culture) to go to a single store and not see a minion or two lurking in the isles. The marketing phenomenon this film became will quite likely never be matched again by another animated film- let alone a franchise, and as interesting as it is to put all these facts to mind- it still doesn't describe a single bit of the experience watching this movie. Despicable Me unfolded at the beginning of a new renaissance in animation and definitely reflects a lot of those styles. All though some colors throughout the film can look a bit dated and dingy today- the animation is quite fun to watch, and I was certainly never bored throughout its runtime. In fact, I was constantly surprised at how well it handled itself in pacing- especially from such a new studio. The voice acting is honestly perfect, and although some formulaic issues still arise, the film is able to feel very genuine and heartfelt and even made me shed a tear or two. In the end, Despicable Me is a modern classic whether we like it or not. It may not be my favorite animated movie this year or this decade, but its relevance in pop culture certainly won't fade anytime soon and for that it certainly has my respect.My Rating: 8.6/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Michael ""Gru"" Scott","Before I watched this movie, I didn't expected to cry at all because I thought it's just one of the kids movie, and I was pretty confident that I'm not gonna cry for those cheesy stuffs. However, the movie had definitely me in tears, and I laughed a lot too.Although I couldn't understand what the yellow creature is till end, by the way Gru said they are his cousin, they are so weird and cute!! and you don't care whatever it is if it's just lovable, do you?One thing I couldn't be satisfied about this movie is Steve Carell's voice reminded me of Michael Scott too much, and I couldn't focused on his character. I guess this is just my problem because I'm so addicted to the TV show ""The Office"", so if you are not a big fan of that TV show, I guarantee you can enjoy the movie very much with or without your kids!",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
An enjoyable animation movie,"The plot of the movie was really interesting and kinda innovative than other animation movies. The storyline was very well written and everything was well explained.

The graphics and the effects of the movie were both really cool. It wasn't an intense movie, actually most animated movie aren't intense. But, it was very funny, full of jokes and iconic scenes.

funny lovely,"The story is very creative and simple, the plot is vivid and interesting, but not complicated. The plot development seems logical, but the most decisive factor in the study is how the three children distracted a villain, let him find something more interesting than stealing the moon, and hide it under the appearance of full of evil. The sensitive and fragile heart is exposed a little bit, and a little bit soft and strong, until it is completely transformed. This kind of reasonable change can only be accomplished by a series of seemingly insignificant, absurd but reasonable, wonderful details that touch the character's soul and the conflicts and reversals formed by these details.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

A phenomenal first chapter to this crazy franchise.,"Despicable Me (2010) was the first Illumination Entertainment Movie that I've seen and it's the first one that I saw in the theater. Since then, this movie has turned into one of the most successful and insane movie franchise in Hollywood. Despite its numerous issues, I still love this movie for all of its flaws 14 years later.Positives for Despicable Me (2010):
This movie knows how to have fun with its premise to the point where it has become one of the most endlessly rewatchable movies of all time. I also really enjoy a lot of the characters in the movie. Steve Carrell is awesome as Gru where even though this guy is a villain you just can't help yourself but love him for all his villainy and asides from Over the Hedge (2006), this was the movie that introduced me to Steve Carrell and what he can bring as a main character which a lot of other people already knew during his time in The Office (2005-2013). I will say this it's odd to see and hear Michael Scott talk about evil plans after binge watching The Office for the first time over a month ago. I also liked Margo, Edith and Agnes in this movie as they are basically helping Gru change his ways by the end of the movie. It is also worth noting that I watched this movie in the theater because Margo was voiced by Miranda Cosgrove, who I only knew as Carly Shay from iCarly (2007-2012). Also, it is very interesting to see and hear both Michael Scott and Carly Shay butting heads with each other. Jason Segel as Vector was a great villain as he was both very calculating and funny. I also really enjoyed Russell Brand as Dr. Nefario. And of course, we can't talk about this movie without talking about the Minions themselves as they are the reason why so many people are obsessed with these movies. The Minions are those characters who add that extra level of fun that this movie needs and also their scenes are very funny.Negatives for Despicable Me (2010);
Now these negatives don't bother me with this first movie, but they are definitely worth pointing out. First of all, this movie marks the beginning of what people like to called the Illuminationisms that present in all of the movies made by Illumination Entertainment. First of all, you have characters using some of the most ludicrous stuff that you'll ever see in any movie. You also have the movie soundtrack containing radio hit songs that a lot of people, specifically the adults, get annoying and tired of constantly hearing. And finally, Gru's arc in this movie is very predictable cause from the moment when he adopts Margo, Edith and Agnes, it is made so obvious how the movie is going to play out throughtout the rest of the runtime.Overall, Despicable Me (2010) is a phenomenal movie that I continue to love ever since I saw it over 14 years ago and while there are elements that definitely will bother some people, it's still a movie where the whole family can have fun watching.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Incredible simple story 3D feature film,"Having watched a lot of Pixar and Dreamworks animated movies, and having watched movies with the main voice (Steve Carell). I expected something on par with those - only to be disappointed together with my girlfriend who suffered throughout the movie with me.Lots of scenes are pure 100% 3D-showoff, which is very lame when seeing it without glasses, some of these 3D scenes are long and very uninteresting with no dialog. The story even makes pauses for these scenes to finish !The voice of the main character is performed by Steve Carell and has an Italian/Russian dialect which is terrible and unnecessary/misplaced, The voice of Anton Ego (Ratatouille) would have made a better dark/sinister voice (perhaps not suited for the story - but better for the character)I felt the story too flat and the movie too focused on 3D features to find it as good as Toy Story, Ice Age, Over the Hedge etc.HOWEVER!Kudos to the animation studio - this is the finest quality of animated pictures I've ever seen (not counting Transformers and other realistic movies)",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Enjoyable to watch,"Despicable Me (2010) is a delightful animated film with great music featuring rock, upbeat pop, and disco boogie songs. The music selection is iconic and lived up until today. The film introduces its characters and their intentions well, with the minions being the standout elements. They are funny, speak their own language, and add a unique charm to the movie.The editing is superb, maintaining a steady pace throughout the film. The writing is well-planned, obvious, engaging, and witty. I particularly enjoyed the use of homophones, jokes, and puns, which added a clever touch to the dialogue. The plot twists are well-executed. The story raises interesting questions for discussion about the nature of being a villain, the potential for redemption, and the complexities of parenting.Cinematically, the film is successful and effective. The camera work is effective in showing the scale well, showing the true size of objects and characters, which adds a layer of realism. However, one downside is the animation. While the style and character designs are unique, the colors often appear pale and unrendered, making some scenes look cheap, except for low-light and night scenes which were animated well. Additionally, some characters' facial expressions don't always match the voice actors' tones. Despite these flaws, the film contains many wholesome moments and great transitions, making it enjoyable to watch with a good company of friends. The final scenes are especially heartwarming, providing a satisfying conclusion.Despicable Me is a charming and entertaining film with memorable characters and a clever script. Despite some shortcomings in animation and emotional depth, it remains a fun and enjoyable watch. Overall, I give it a decent to solid 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Loved every second of it!,"The film was much better than I thought although I did think the main character would be truly evil. My 5-year old understood and loved the movie so much we ran to get the DVD and she watches it every single day. We loved the movie because it's very, very funny, along the lines of Shrek and Madagascar and carries a healthy message about friendship, loyalty and kindness like Nemo and Ice Age. The main character's accent is delightful and the portrayal of the nasty-side of people is both realistic and healthy for children to see and talk about like Miss Hattie and the bank manager and his son. A must-see for almost anyone above 5.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Movie failed to develop the three kids characters; failed to evoke an emotional connection with the character; underlying plot is strong; good ending; good script, animation","Just watched it for the first time, 10 years after it came out. I kept putting this one off for some unknown reason. It is on Netflix now so I finally watched it.This is a good film for kids and adults and for the family to watch together. The underlying story is very meaningful and any adult could appreciate it, as well as most kids.Guru's character was the only character that was so well-developed and memorable that he can easily become cemented in everyone's memory. I appreciated the fact that we got glimpses of Gru's life as a kid, but I wish we had gotten more backstory about Gru.The animation was done well. But the kids were underwhelming.I feel this movie had so much potential to evoke strong emotions from the audience but FAILED for the most part to accomplish that. For example, Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse (2018) developed characters and portrayed scenes that evoked strong emotions from the audience and I am sure that was one of the reasons why it won an Oscar for best animated feature. This movie on the other hand failed to develop the three kids characters and also failed to make us feel strong emotions for these characters.Conclusion: it is a good film with an adult underlying plot that both kids and adults can watch and appreciate. The screenplay/script, animation, voice acting, and directing were done right. However, this movie failed to deliver true character development with the three kids and it also failed to truly evoke an emotional connection with the characters. Plot had a good ending. This movie does not deserve more than 8. I will now go watch the sequel.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Cute - Typical Animated Film,"Modern animated films tend to work on two-levels. They hit the target market of adults and mature audiences with wider issues, and comedic elements for that audience. And of course, they also work on the expected basis of being entertainment for children and family.Despicable Me is a cute film with a lot of heart. It's funny and perfect for children and families. On this level, it's a very good film for it's genre.However, I feel as though - like other top-notch Hollywood animated films - It could've provided something more. Especially for a film that had received such rave reviews.I also felt like the film put the cutest or funniest lines (ie ""It's so fluffy!!!!"") in the trailer which was a bit of a let-down for the mature audience watching.Overall - Good film for children and family, nothing more.

This movie is a great children movie,"The first movie in the Despicable Me series is a classic. I love how Gru-the main character-wants to steal the moon, but he needs to steal the shrink ray first, and then get money from the bank in order to build a rocket. And the part where he fails to sneak into Vector's fortress is funny with all the failed attempts as they get more painful. Gru's idea to use robots that could disguise themselves as robots and adopt the girls was clever. The part when Doctor Nefario shows the boogie robots is really funny too, especially because he was about to dance to the music when Gru turns it off. The part when Nefario returned the girls to the orphanage without even telling Gru is very sad, and I don't like the part when Gru doesn't show up to the dance recital and must save the girls after Vector kidnapped them. It's amazing that Gru somehow stole the moon ""temporarily"" when his rocket was complete. It's kind of shocking that Gru didn't think about the side effects and consequences of using the shrink ray. The way that Gru defeated Vector by sending him into space, but Gru got lucky by saving the girls at the last second, and having his minions at his side.

Despicable Me is Despicably Entertaining. At least before you dive into the sequel and spin off.,"The first Despicable Me movie kick-started Universal's most lucrative animation franchise, and the first one to have any real meat to it since The Land Before Time, and An American Tail. It's interesting that a film about a super-villain named Gru, voiced by Steve Carell, becomes Universal's biggest franchise since the Jurassic Park Back to the Future film series. Well, it's definitely worthy of being a successful franchise, even if it is just the original film in this case.Despicable Me is a villain-lead film that gets away with some naughtily subtle humor relating to villainy. The story is this: Gru wants to pull of the greatest heist in history, in the form of stealing the Moon! That all changes when these three little girls come into his life; and they're very good at evading top-notch security. So, later on, he decides to adopt them and raise them as his own: at least as accomplices in crime.Despicable Me is a nice little unique trip in the field of animation, and I can see why it's become a beloved classic since its release.

Cartel's voice acting is as entertaining as possible, and the Minions are just a masterstroke of brilliance that my daughter exclaims, ""it's so cute!"" every time they're on the TV. But this animated heist film becomes much more as three orphaned girls warm the heart of criminal mastermind Gru as he grows from an evil loner to a caring father.

"A movie to see with the family, and see again several times.","This is one of the most interesting animated films I have seen in recent years. Its not the first time we see a villain portrayed in a comic way on animated movies, but its rare to see one become a real hero (well, in fact, ""Megamind"", from the same year, tackles the same theme in a different way).The film revolves around the figure of a failed villain who tries to steal the Moon, despite the constant interference of three girls he adopts and the competition with a new rival. The film also has the Minions, the villain's helpers. These adorable creatures speak an incomprehensible language and look curiously like cheese snacks in jeans, but they star in some of the film's most hilarious and absurd moments. The humor is intelligent, not forced or stupid and knows when to give way to the story in order to keep the film coherent and with a good rhythm. All the characters were very well thought out. Computer animation, the basis of animations, has been carefully done, is very pleasing to eye of the public and inspires a pleasant sense of realism.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Witty, and cute, even if forgettable.","Despicable Me centers on a mediocre super villain named Gru (Voiced by Steve Carrell's best imitation of Bela Lugosi), a man with minions, a mad scientist to invent weapons for him, and a pet dog/fraggle. He plots to use a shrink ray so he can steal the moon, but that plan is thwarted when the shrink ray is stolen by a rival super villain, the film's overly obnoxious antagonist Vector (Voiced by Jason Segel). But hope is not lost for Gru. He adopts three orphan girls (Voiced by the alright Dana Gaier, the simply adorable Elsie Fisher, and the somewhat effective Miranda Cosgrove of iCarly fame), to sell Vector cookies, so that he can steal back the shrink ray, and complete his objective. But soon the girls start to warm Gru's cold heart, and make him realize he's a better good guy than bad.The film's premise is solid, and it tries its best to do good with the material, and I say ""tries"" because it's only half-successful. It takes a lot of influence from things like Pixar films, and Looney Tunes, and at times quite trivially. Some characters feel too rushed in screen time, and are inconsistently written, changing from sympathetic, to sarcastic in the blink of an eye.The film has a large cast that, besides Carrell and Segel, include comedic talents like Will Arnett, Russell Brand, and Kristen Wiig. Some of these characters feel annoying, and some feel like they're there just to be there, such as Gru's impossible-to-please mother, voiced by screen and stage legend Julie Andrews, who speaks in an inconsistent Hungarian accent.The only thing that really keeps the movie on its feet is the humor, with some fine one-liners, and often delightful sight gags, none the least of which are Gru's hilarious yellow followers who steal each and every scene they're in. But not all of the humor is successful, and even if the voice cast had some strong passion for their roles, it didn't translate too well onto screen.As far as both kids and adults go, I can't quite recommend Despicable Me because it is a good movie, and would be much MUCH quicker to suggest films like How to Train Your Dragon and Toy Story 3. In the end, it's probably best to skip it.** out of ****",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

A Heartwarming and Hilarious Animated Classic,"Despicable Me (2010), directed by Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud, is a delightful animated film that masterfully combines humor, heart, and a touch of villainy. Featuring an unforgettable cast of characters and a story with universal appeal, it's no wonder this film has become a modern classic.Pros:
Lovable Main Character: Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) is one of the most memorable animated characters of the decade. His transformation from a self-centered supervillain to a caring father is heartwarming and believable. Carell's hilarious delivery, with a comically exaggerated accent, adds another layer of charm to the character.The Minions: The mischievous, yellow, gibberish-speaking Minions steal the show with their slapstick humor and adorable antics. They're a perfect balance of silly and lovable, providing endless laughs for both kids and adults.Strong Emotional Core: At its heart, Despicable Me is about the power of love and family. Gru's relationship with the three orphaned girls-Margo, Edith, and Agnes-is genuinely touching, particularly as he grows to care for them. The story delivers plenty of ""aww"" moments without feeling overly sentimental.Clever Humor: The film's humor works on multiple levels, appealing to children with its physical comedy and to adults with its witty writing and subtle jokes. It's a rare feat for a family movie to be so universally entertaining.Imaginative Design and World-Building: The gadgets, inventions, and quirky settings-like Gru's villain lair and the Bank of Evil-are wonderfully imaginative. The film's playful take on the world of supervillains is fresh and fun.Catchy Music: Pharrell Williams's music, particularly the upbeat and infectious ""Despicable Me"" theme song, adds an extra dose of energy and personality to the film.Cons:
Simple Villain: Vector, Gru's rival, is entertaining but not particularly compelling or complex as an antagonist. While his goofy personality fits the movie's tone, he doesn't pose much of a threat to Gru or his journey.Predictable Plot: The story follows a fairly standard redemption arc, which might feel predictable to some viewers. However, the execution is so engaging that it hardly detracts from the overall experience.Conclusion:
Despicable Me is a nearly perfect blend of humor, heart, and imagination. With its lovable characters, clever humor, and touching story, it's a movie that resonates with audiences of all ages. While it may not have the most complex villain or groundbreaking story, its charm and emotional depth make it a standout in the world of animated films. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"A funny, entertaining film...and that is not all","Being honest, I did not see this feature in theaters because it looked dumb. A short while back, a relative received a copy of it from Netflex and we watched it. It has been two months since I lost saw this movie and I cannot help but keep thinking about it.""Despicable Me"" is almost purely a funny movie. The humor does not just come from the sight gags (particularly from the light bulb shaped minions); it also comes from the ridiculousness of the plot itself. Going even further, the characters have a retro appearance that take me back to days of Pixar's release of The ""Incredibles."" The main character has a bulky figure, but thin legs. The antagonist looks like a nerd from the show ""The Big Bang Theory."" The mad scientist looks like an older Chris Lloyd from ""Back to the Future"". You get where I am going with this—blatant caricatures. The film even incorporates violence to the point that it is classic slapstick.But what really make this animated feature so good are the story and the emotions it brings to the table. Without giving any of it way, the movie brings up the question: Can a criminal mastermind develop love for orphaned children? There is such strong development and emotions in the characters that they almost brought me to tears. What I am trying to say is, I really care for characters. When I see them happy, I feel happy. When I see them sad, I feel sad. When they are danger, I fear for their lives.This feature really shows that it doesn't take a famous animation studio like Pixar to make a really good animated film. There are two things that bug me about this feature though. For one, the adoption agency is shown in a negative light. This may offend some people, particularly individuals who have been adopted. Second, some of the humor is a bit inappropriate and crude for an animated feature. The Shrek films incorporate fart jokes, no biggie, but ""Despicable Me"" includes some innuendos and even a scene where characters scan their butts for amusement—this is unnecessary for a family-oriented animated film. This is a good film, but some of the quirks I listed above drag its score down some. It is obvious that Toy Story 3 would win for Best Animated Feature and it did (rightfully so). However, this should have received an Oscar nomination.My rating: *** out of ****",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Amazing fun , lots of madness and action as well as laughter","This movie is surely for those who get bored by watching movies.

The tagline for this movie is halfway accurate.,"""Despicable Me"" (2010), as I mentioned, the tagline is halfway correct. Just erase ""SUPER DAD"", and it will be accurate! Now, I know that a lot of you are thinking: ""my quote doesn't match the word on the tagline."" Well, unlike whoever wrote the tagline for the poster, I know proper grammar and I know how to hit the Spacebar between words! They got the tagline correct with it saying, ""SUPER BAD"". Any way, let's get back to my review for this ""film"". I'm just going to say this right off the bat, I did not see this ""movie"" in the theater voluntarily. Ironically, that's probably the number one way I'm introduced to such horrible films! One day, I was spending time with some of my relatives and one of my younger cousins wanted to see this ""movie"". I had a feeling it was going to suck. But, I reluctantly agreed and saw it for the sake of my family. (I need to stop doing that!) However, I just said to myself: ""there may be something good in this film, I'll give it a chance."" Wow, did I make a mistake! ""Despicable Me"" has an obnoxious and redundant story, substandard voice acting, and an overall generic soundtrack to attempt to tie it all together. The plot is, an evil scientist named Gru adopts three orphan girls named Margo, Edith, and Agnes while also attempting to steal a shrink ray from his rival Vector in order to shrink and steal the moon. Yeah, it's every bit as ridiculous and pointless as it sounds. Now, I will give the story some minuscule credit. The concept of a villainous scientist being the main protagonist does sound a bit interesting. Why? Because, it would be an interesting dilemma for the plot, as he struggles to figure out the difference between right and wrong. That concept has been done before, where a flawed movie character redeems himself. I said to myself: ""if they keep that concept prevalent throughout the film, then it might work!"" But no, it just falls flat on it's face with the same boring and cliched fish out of water story with dull characters and uninspired jokes. Seriously, that's the whole entire ""movie""! The writing is so lazy, that I could predict everything that was about to occur before it happened. When you can see what's going to happen in the plot, then that's a problem! As for the acting, it's sadly just as lackluster as the story. The sad thing is, you have a lot of great voice actors/actresses in the cast! You have: Steve Carrell, Jason Segel, Russell Brand, Miranda Cosgrove and they even somehow convinced the one and only Julie Andrews to join the cast list! What a waste of talent, really, all of them just sound like they're only reading their lines and anticipating their paychecks. All of the characters in this ""film"" are extremely boring and unlikeable. Don't even get me started on those unappealing and painfully unfunny penis-shaped minions! For some reason, those dumb and uncreative characters have become a worldwide phenomenon. Every time I look at them, it's like a slap in the face! All they are is yellow pills with limbs. How is that supposed to be creative?! Bottom line, the whole cast was a wasted opportunity and all of the character portrayals suffer as a result. Finally, the soundtrack composed by Heitor Pereira, Pharrell Williams and even Hans Zimmer was a letdown! Somehow, they roped in Hans Zimmer, one of my top ten all-time film score composers and even he was unable to save the music. Even if the music was good, it wouldn't have redeemed anything in this ""movie"". Now, let's get to the only good element in this ""film"", the animation. Granted, I'm not the biggest fan of CGI, but the animation here was well-done. Some of the characters may be hideous, but other than that, the animation was decent. ""Despicable Me"" is just yet another predictable and cliched ""movie"" in the world of animated films. It's so bad, that it actually almost made my top ten worst animated movies of all-time list. But, I felt that it didn't quite deserve to make that list, it still got knocked back by some stiff competition! Still, the fact that I considered it for that list explains a lot. I'm struggling to give this ""film"" 1 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 2 out of 10 IMDB stars. Do I really have to say avoid this ""movie""? Granted, it doesn't show anything harmful or offensive to a younger audience. But, the big issue is, that it was very poorly conceived. I didn't even bother with the sequels, and you know what? I refuse to watch them, and I especially won't waste my time with the pointless ""Minions"" movies! Bottom line is, ""Despicable Me"" is another pointless entry in the world of animated films. It was a waste of 95 minutes of my life! On a final note, the title is almost accurate. Just remove the word, ""Me, and the title will be right on the nose, ""Despicable""! As Daffy Duck himself would most likely say, ""it's despicable!""",2.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

"Not a masterpiece, but hilarious!","This is one of the wonders we can do with technology. It is a hilarious movie with an actual storyline to go with the humor. The story, simple as it is, is one that cover all bases with both love and hate and all kinds of jokes. In the end it is also a feel-good movie with some cute scenes filled with adorable minions, kids, and annoying mothers. Steve Carell creates a funny character and with Russell Brand at his side they are unstoppable.However, this is not a masterpiece that will change your life after watching it. It is just some cute animation with a storyline that makes your laugh. It's fun, not inspiring.

That's why we were touched by this movie.,"In life, we long to be proven to exist. And only those who truly prove their existence are those who truly love themselves. The sensationalist things we have done are just because of loneliness. Those who marvel at what we have done are only temporary memories of us. Those who truly remember us and make us not lonely are still those who love us with their true hearts. Even if we only do a small thing, they will always remember.Never do foolish things because you are too lonely.

Way TOO CUTE!!  8 Stars from me!!!,"A very sweet movie I'm certain that many can relate to in terms of 'adoption'. I wasn't adopted, but I spent almost 4 years in a foster home before my real parent came back to get me. So that feeling of abandonment was with me for many years and I saw myself relating to the three little girls in the orphanage. I finally figured out that it didn't matter after all. But I held a grudge for several years that finally dissipated with my own resolve.So warm was this movie! It melts the heart when a father-figure (alone or together with a mate) wants to raise children with proper morality and values. Cool role modeling kind of movie!I have not seen the sequels to this movie yet, but I probably will check them out at some point. The children were adorable, especially during bedtime and at the theme park when trying to win the unicorn stuffed animal, my favorite parts of the film. I recommend this film, especially to all 'wanna-be' dads and children who have come from parental or guardian 'abandonments'.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Good for Some!,"Well first off I know a lot of people who love this movie, but for me once it finally came out I didn't like it much.

I also got insanely bored about halfway threw. There was lot's of yawning and etc. I kept watching it though to see if anything else would be new and there wasn't anything.Like I said this is good for some. I think it's perfect for kids and I guess it's good if there is nothing else to watch.My rating would be a 3. If I had to say like or dislike I would pick dislike. I watched it once and I that was enough for me. I know there is a lot of people out there whom love this movie but to each there own. My personal opinion is that this movie sucks! I would not invest the money to buy it or even see it in the theater when it was in.Well there really isn't much more I can say about this movie. Just hope someone actually like's this movie!

Pretty Despicable Me,"Despicable Me is the first film featuring those annoying yellow characters in overalls who like bananas: the minions. It also introduces their master Gru, who is a failing villain. Gru wants to steal the moon after not being too successful as a villain. With that goal in mind, he adopts 3 girls in order to attempt to achieve his goal, though that helps give him a second thought. I find Despicable Me is similar to Megamind as both films follow villains who give their villainies a second thought after the events that transpired throughout the films. As well, their voice actors could be well known (Steve Carrel as Gru, who's known for the office and the 40 year old Virgin, and Will Ferrall as Megamind, of whom played in Elf and the Lego movie and had a guest appearance in the Office). It also does show some emotional deepness like Pixar, though Pixar seems to have even more.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Great family movie,"This film has many funny moments for both children and adults making it enjoyable for not just the children but also for older audiences as well. The voice acting is well done and also well synced to the animation. One of the good things about this film is the fact that it doesn't take itself too seriously, although it does deal with some drama. Although, several things I didn't like were the amount of detail on the strange yellow minions was well underwhelming. Also by the end of the film the name ""Despicable Me"" doesn't seem to have much relevancy to the story. But, overall it is highly enjoyable and a great 3d experience as well.

How a Superbad man became a Superdad,"The movie despicable me starts out with a criminal Gru. Gru is very bad minded and wants to shrink the moon and have it for his own. Gru has many minions that work for him also so that can help the process. Gru is trying to get money from the bank for his rocket. He sees a villain named vector and Gru is annoyed by vector. Gru is angered because he could not get any money from the bank and is now competing with the villain named vector. Gru needs help so he decided to get little girls from an orphanage so they can sabotage vector. When going on further in the story Gru starts to have compassion and love like a father for the girls. Gru sadly gets rid of the girls and tries to go for the moon by himself. The ending will be interesting so you must watch it. I would give this movie a nine. The movie had great plot, showed the real meaning of true compassion and love for one another. It would be a great movie for everybody to watch. It is really funny and good for children all around.

Despicably Cute,"THE GIST: Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud's DESPICABLE ME is best described as ""cute"", which is a fine thing but not the best thing that this movie could have been. In the film, Gru (voiced by Steve Carell), our evil mastermind for a protagonist, inadvertently adopts three little girls in his quest to steal the moon and better his competing evil nemesis Vector (Jason Segel). The movie is a lot of fun, especially for the G-rated crowd. As for the adults, well...the serious laughs are few and far between and the movie tries too hard to be something its not that it never truly comes into its own. With such a fresh premise that is somewhere between MEGAMIND and MONSTERS INC., it is sad that the conflict is as thin as a Nick Jr. cartoon and the supporting characters overshadow everything else going on in the film. However, the film really owns its cuteness and its heartwarming ending shouldn't be overlooked.THE BEST PART: The Minions, which are a cross between the Doozers from FRAGGLE ROCK and the aliens from TOY STORY, could carry a movie all their own.THE VERDICT: Parts of DESPICABLE ME seem awfully familiar and there may not be enough weight in the story to carry a feature-length film, but its goofy enough to smile through and is a sure-fire hit with the under-10 crowd.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Sure, the ""Looney Tunes"" inspired violence is entertaining and the film has a lot of heart. The main issue is the writing, it's obvious from the start that Gru will be a reformed villain at the end of the day. Add to that the uninspiring animation.

for kids,"The Hollywood has raised the animation standards so much that this film remains mediocre. Children enjoy it, but there are hundreds of films that are much better for adults.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Indespicable Gru and The Three Orphans,"Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud's 'Despicable Me' is a charming, colourful and funny little film that centers around a scientist and three little orphan girls (whom he adopts...with a hidden agenda of course). Now the animation and voice casting is first rate. It seems to be a trend to cast a host of big actors to voice the characters and here it seems to have worked. The animation too is very detailed and colourful.The jokes are quite funny and they provide some great laugh out loud moments. I only found the story to be too familiar. In other words, it's been done to death. Thus, pretty much every forthcoming moment of it is predictable. The vivacious characters make up somewhat for the lack of novelty in the story. Gru, his minions and the three girls (though the littlest one was annoying at times) are very likable.If only the story wasn't too obvious, this could have been right up there with the Pixar movies. Yet, it's the animation, humour and the characters that stand out in 'Despicable Me' and make it worth watching. One ought to watch it through the rolling credit in order to not miss out on some more funny moments.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
An average animation that was low on humour,I didn't expect much from Despicable Me and I was left slightly disappointed as I was hoping to be proved wrong. I'm not a Steve Carell fan and this movie hasn't improved my opinion of him.I found that the plot in some ways was similar to Megamind- a villain wants to be the most hated super villain in the world and concocts a wicked plan to achieve his target. But along the way circumstances change and he finds himself becoming more of a hero than a villain.Megamind was better because Will Ferrel was funnier and the humour in that movie was far better. Here I didn't find myself laughing too much nor did I think too much of Gru. Steve Carell didn't do a good job with the voice acting- his accent kept slipping and his American twang was becoming more evident. Even the supporting cast was less than average.where the movie did jump up a notch was due to the Minions who were cute and hilarious. It was great that they couldn't speak English or that would probably have spoiled the fun.Is it worth watching? It's not a definite recommend. Megamind is much better. But it's worth watching just for the Minions alone. Hopefully if the next one comes out Gru's voice is recast with someone better.,,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Its a light hearted hilarious cartoon filled with so many elements of realism and animation.

funniest film of the year,"This movie is a battle to become the most evil.The plot focuses around a pyramid bring stolen and replaced by an inflatable model. Our main character is credited with it but has in fact not done it. Ashamed he had to come up with a more evil plan stealing the moon!The animation is impressive. It can be seen in 2D or 3D, but works well in both.U rated, this will appeal to kid of all ages and most adults accompanying them.It is one of the funniest films of the year. I give it 4 **** stars",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
This movie is made for kids!!,"Why it rocks:
The idea for a movie where the protagonist is a villain who has a change of heart is very original and creative.The movie's script is very entertaining and well-written, as it has some pretty funny quotes.Many of the characters are likable and fun, especially for Gru and three orphan kids.In fact, Gru is a sympathetic character and his motivations for being a villain are understandable.The Minions can make you laugh in most of the scenes, and their relationship with Gru and his adopted daughters is very heartwarming.One of the orphan girls, Agnes is absolutely adorable.The humor is hilarious and creative. Even some of the bathroom humor is funny, with Gru's plan being one example.The animation (even when it is produced in CGI) is pretty decent, especially considering it was the first movie by Illumination Entertainment.Vector is a really hilarious villain who has many memorable lines (such as ""Oh yeah!"").Many of the film's actions scenes are quite amazing to watch, especially the scene when Gru steals the shrinking ray.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A very good animation,"This film is about a villain who adopts three girl orphans in order to complete his evil plan to steal the moon. His plan is in jeopardy when he develops a bond with the girls.""Despicable Me"" is such a good animation! It is so much fun. The jokes are really funny, and what's even more amazing is that they achieve this humour with sparkly clean jokes. The characters are so cute, those potato-like minions look so adorable. Even if they have got only one eye, they look so cute! I really like the story too. Adults will enjoy the warm feelings of parent-child interactions, while children will enjoy, well, just about everything. ""Despicable Me"" is one of the best animations I have seen recently, and it deserves all the good word of mouth it has been generating.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Silly Storyline, Wonderful Animation","Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules is a fantastic sequel in the Wimpy series. This film is a super fun adaptation from the popular book series Diary of a Wimpy Kid. I really enjoy that it shows the relationship between Greg and Rodrick, because it shows the ups and downs of being siblings. I especially like the fact that I related to this movie so much. I have a brother, like Greg, and I'm also a middle-schooler. I feel that this film truly captures a lot of the real struggles of middle school life. My favorite character is Greg Heffley, played by Zachary Gordon, because he gets into so many funny embarrassing situations. I had the privilege to talk with him in a recent interview. His favorite scene is when he and Rodrick run from their coach over the dumpster, because it was so fun to do. This is also my favorite scene because when Rodrick and Greg are pranking all the people and running from their coach at the gas station, they really bond. This wonderful movie is for everyone because it is funny for an audience of many different age groups. Overall I give Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules two thumbs up.

"A Light-Hearted, Fun-Filled & Wonderfully Animated Feature From Illumination Entertainment","Illumination Entertainment's feature film debut is an incessantly sweet, delightfully charming & wonderfully animated treat that brims with lots of energy, heart & creativity, and also finds an exquisite balance between its storytelling aspects & outrageous moments of comedy to succeed as one fine family-friendly entertainer for viewers of all ages.The story of Despicable Me follows Gru; a supervillain whose pride his hurt when the Great Pyramid of Giza is stolen by an unknown villain, following which he reveals his master plan that will put other villains to shame. He also adopts three orphan girls as pawns for his grand scheme but soon find out that their love is changing him into a different person.Co-directed by Pierre Coffin & Chris Renaud, Despicable Me packs in a lot of freshness in its story, humour & characters and even if the screenplay borrows many different elements from other examples of its medium, the film manages to carve an originality of its own. The camera-work is 3D oriented, editing unfolds the plot briskly & background score is pleasant as well.Coming to the characters, they're cleverly imagined, designed & rendered and also benefit a lot from its brilliantly chosen voice-cast, especially Steve Carell who voices Gru. Even the developing relationship between Gru & his trio of girls has a genuine feel to it. But it's the Minions who end up stealing the show for almost every scene featuring them is hilarious as hell.On an overall scale, Despicable Me is a light-hearted, fun-filled & joyous work of animation that promises an amusing, heartwarming & satisfying experience and effortlessly delivers it. A delight for the kids & an unexpected surprise for the grown-ups, the film may not feature a memorable story or groundbreaking animation but as far as having good times at movies is concerned, Despicable Me is a sureshot winner.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Steam rollin, whatever I see, uhhh huh... Despicaple Me!","Despicable me falls into what I like to call the bad is the new good category in which villainy is the focus but ends up becoming good. only three films exist in this category This one, Igor and Megamind (with a fourth due in 2012 by Disney). Despicable is also the few other computer-animated films out their capable of taking on flagship studios like Dreamworks and Pixar. Don't think of Despicable Me as another lame family film because it's not, it's actually a good one. Kids will no doubt lap this one up as if it was melted chocolate and adults will find themselves entertained by this heart-warming,humorous and clever animation flick which borrows rather smartly from War bros. cartoons and other more higher-ranking studios as opposed to just ripping them off. Kids will obviously fall for the yellow minions in the film with Their cute looks, Irresponsible ways and bizarre native dialect. It also has some great voice talent from numerous A-list actors e.g Steve Carrel, Russel Brand and Jason Segal IF people were to look back at this film in say about 10 years time they will probably consider it the 5th best animated movie ever (Behind A Nightmare before Christmas, Shrek, South Park: Bigger,longer and uncut and of course Toy story umm.. what should I go for here Toy story 1, 2 or 3? I can't decided cause their such good films.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
