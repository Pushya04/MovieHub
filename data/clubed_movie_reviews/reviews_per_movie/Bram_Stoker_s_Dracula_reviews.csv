"Visually audacious, eerie and operatic version of the undead legend","There were several reasons why I wanted to see Bram Stoker's Dracula, and after seeing the film finally I was really impressed. No seriously I was. It is not perfect, but on the whole it is very well done.I have read Bram Stoker's book several times and love it to death, it is rich in detail, it is haunting and it is shocking. This film is not the truest film version of the book, and that's putting it mildly, but it is one of the more visually beautiful and intriguing ones. That is no way a flaw, I am not the sort of person who says if this adaptation is untrue to the book I pan it, or at least I try not to. Speaking of flaws there are two significant flaws, one is more significant than the other, that stop the film from perfection. At over two hours the film is probably a little too long. But the biggest problem is Keanu Reeves as Jonathan Harker. I know it is not old news to rag on Reeves's performance, and I will say I am not a fan of his, sure he has been in some very good films but he is nearly always one of the weaker assets which is exactly the case here. Jonathan Harker is an estate agent who is threatened by Dracula, but I found Reeves's acting far too too inept, flat and emotionless, complete with a very unimpressive accent. For instance, when he says ""Oh, I'm very sorry""- Keanu I know there aren't many ways to say that phrase strictly speaking, but do actually try to sound as though you're sorry.Flaws aside, Francis Ford Coppola's film is very, very good. It is eerie, it is romantic and it is even operatic. For one thing, it is exquisitely mounted, very grandiose in its visual approach. From the sumptuous costumes, the lovingly crafted settings, the superb make up and the basic yet atmospheric lighting complete with more sophisticated techniques it is a feast for the eyes. Another strength is the score, it was very like an opera, rich, soulful, haunting and melancholic. I also liked the script, it was poetic, it was intelligent and it was sophisticated, and the plot is coherent with some effective scenes such as Mina following Lucy into the garden when Lucy is later attacked by Dracula. And the direction is wonderful, a lot of fashioned touches are made to make this film very watchable at least once.With the exception of Reeves, the acting is very good. Winona Ryder is an improvement certainly, she is beautiful and intense thus she becomes the object of Dracula's devastating desire. Her chemistry with Reeves wasn't quite there, but with Gary Oldman it was pretty much smouldering. Anthony Hopkins was one of the main reasons why I wanted to see this film in the first place, he is a brilliant actor, one of the best there is actually. See him in The Elephant Man, Shadowlands, Howards' End and the Remains of the Day, all wonderful films, and he is impeccable in all of them. I enjoyed him here, here he plays Dr Van Helsing, a famed doctor who dares to believe in Dracula and in the end even dares to confront him, and gives a delicious performance making the most of some inventive one-liners. Richard E.Grant, Cary Elwes and Bill Campbell all give great support, but it is Gary Oldman's towering performance as Dracula that dominates the film. An excellent, underrated actor(Immortal Beloved is just living proof of his talent), Oldman is menacing, suave, handsome, charismatic, tragic and just amazing here, his transitions from old to young and from man to beast are completely believable, in short it was one of the more interesting interpretations of Dracula. Also look out for Monica Belluci as one of Dracula's wives, she is breathtakingly beautiful, even Sadie Frost was surprisingly good as Lucy.Overall, if you want a faithful adaptation of the book, you may be disappointed. However, if you want a visually stunning, richly scored and compelling movie this is perfect for you. Regardless of how it deviates from the book, I liked it a lot, and would definitely see it again. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Visually striking, but Coppola's storytelling eccentricities are ill suited for the story itself","""Apocalypse Now"" worked due to its hazy, surreal vision of a hellish world. Coppola returned thirteen years later and created a similarly haunting and poetic so-called ""masterpiece,"" a supposed truthful adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula tale - when, in fact, the truth is that this movie is no more faithful to Stoker than the (superior) Universal Pictures original.The hazy film-making is visually satisfying, and some of the special effects are - simply put - amazing. Coppola's backlighting and use of shadows is creative and unique. But, unfortunately, after a while his emphasis on style over content begins to eat away at the film's other strengths - the relationship between the heroine (Winona Ryder) and Dracula (Gary Oldman) is weak. Many story links are completely nonsensical and people appear and disappear at whimsy. The heroine's fianc√©e (Keanu Reeves) writes to her from Transylvania, asking her to depart at once to marry him; in a matter of one or two scenes she has suddenly traveled a vast distance and is standing at the alter prepared to wed. It seems like Coppola loses a grip on his characters and plotting very early on.Oldman gives a chilling performance but isn't given very much to do, because he's set aside and the special effects take over. The opening scenes of his battle and his motivation to become the King of the Undead is very enthralling - if Coppola had maintained this mixture of style and content the movie would have been far better.The casting of the weak Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder in leading roles harms the impact of the film as well. Reeves sounds like a Californian pothead imitating a Brit; Ryder treats the material as if it is a dramatic, over-the-top theatre rendition; every line she speaks is sickeningly cheesy.Anthony Hopkins turns in a disappointing performance as the utterly forgettable Van Helsing, who is given very little to do in this particular film apart from show up when convenient and sprout fancy little one-liners, most of them dramatic closers to scenes (e.g. ""We are dealing with a demon!"", then a cut-away to another scene.) Overall, ""Dracula"" is a good film and is worth seeing for its visuals alone. It is not, however, the strongest adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel; given the hype surrounding its release in 1992, the completed effort is rather lackluster in the story department.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Oh My Goodness!,"Excuse me, but I just read a series of reviews by people who are disappointed by the fact that this movie didn't follow the same old script that has been done over and over and over again. They gave a provocative movie a rating of ""1"" so they could sabotage what most people thought. Go do something else besides writing about films. This is not a perfect movie, but it takes the basic text of the Stoker novel and extrapolates from it. People seem to be reacting tot he sexuality of this. If we go back to the seminal movies, ""Nosferatu"" being the greatest example, we see that sexual tension dominates these films as well as the books. Dracula has power over people. He can draw women to him. He is not an animal, but he is a sub-human with desires to dominate. Coppola uses this to show his evil intent. Gary Oldman is the most eccentric and wonderful Dracula to come along in years. When did it become written that every Dracula should be the black-caped Bela Lugosi figure that kids still dress up as on Halloween. He is a force to be reckoned with; he is evil; and he is powerful. Remember, people accept the scenes of him sucking the blood out of women without any trouble. Why not an evil abuser of their being? Remember, they are under a spell over which they have no control.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Incessantly Gothic & Unabashedly Erotic,"Incessantly gothic & unabashedly erotic, Dracula brings Bram Stoker's literary classic to the film canvas in all its Victorian glory & required faithfulness and is a visual splendour overflowing with bold vision & audacious choices. But the technical mastery on display is also severely hampered by the film's inconsistent tone, overdone theatrics, casting choices & passionless performances.Directed by Francis Ford Coppola (The Godfather & Apocalypse Now), the story unfolds like an eerie & sensual reverie and is substantially elevated by its operatic set pieces, lavish costumes, vivid photography, old-school effects & uncanny score. The film gets the atmosphere right with its inspired use of colours, shadows, lighting & subliminal imagery that works in tandem with its sexually charged narrative.However, the impressionistic touches, cinematic flourishes & technical ingenuity still don't prove to be enough to mask its shortcomings, for its bloated length & over-the-top drama are further exacerbated by the casting decisions that nearly destroys the whole picture. Neither Keanu Reeves nor Winona Ryder are right choices for their roles and as for the remaining cast, their inputs are serviceable at best & forgettable at worst.Overall, Dracula is a visual feast that delivers on mood, setting & filmmaking creativity but the commitment evident in the technical aspects are sorely lacking in the acting department. And that in effect hurts its ability to fully immerse viewers into its dreamlike escapade. Its romantic gestures are sincere even if the tonal shifts are all over the place but for a premise that has so much promise, the film as a whole leaves much to be desired.",,Anonymous,Horror
Oldman is the Best Dracula Ever!,"This is the best rendition of Dracula ever captured on film. Gary Oldman's dark and sensual personae outshines any other vampire who ever dare put on a cape. To me Gary Oldman is the most talented and underrated actor ever. He becomes who he is playing, however in this role... Dracula became him... Oldman set the bar so high it is untouchable even to Bela Lugosi. Winona Ryder's delicateness suited the role of Mina/Elisabeta nicely and Keanu Reeves played the unsuspecting and naive Jonathan with satisfaction. However the whole movie comes together because of Gary Oldman's intoxicating essence. He draws the viewers into his darkness and passion and guides them through until the end. This film is drastically romantic and hauntingly captivating- just like a real Dracula movie should be. The cinematography deserved Oldman's phenomenal performance and perfectly created a true vampire realm. Francis Ford Coppola is brilliant. This is the spirit of the vampire.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A visual feast.,"I have seen multiple versions of Dracula, but none compare to 1992's version starring Gary Oldman, the definitive Count Dracula in my opinion. This film is lavish, decadent and wonderfully vivid. It captured the gothic spirit of the novel, it's deep, romantic, and mixed with tender and violent moments. The visuals to this day are exquisite, the costumes, sets and scenes of Victorian England are superb.Oldman is incredible, but the supporting cast of Reeves, Hopkins and Ryder are terrific, Winona Ryder's delicate character is superb. The accompanying soundtrack was also fantastic, great songs from Annie Lennox.A true classic. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A well done modern version of the horror tale...,"... although I keep remembering that this ""modern"" tale was filmed 31 years ago.James V. Hart's script seemed heavily indebted to Fred Saberhagen's The Dracula Tape (1980), which was a re-telling of the events of Bram Stoker's novel from the POV of Dracula, whose POV was missing from the Stoker original. It was also much more favorable towards Dracula, and added a lot of the romantic elements.One thing that it did get right was having all the actual characters from the original novel. Many of the adaptations removed one or more of the suitors, especially the American Quincy Morris, or age up Dr. Seward, or make him the father of Mina or Lucy. This version did present them as they were in the novel.Stylistically, it was unusual even for 1992, with Coppola said to be attempting some sort of visual homage to silent and classic film techniques, with some things looking deliberately artificial.I recall at the time thinking Keanu Reeves was highly miscast, and his awkward performance nearly undid the whole film for me. Anthony Hopkins was coming off his Oscar win for The Silence of the Lambs, and he did seem to have his performance pitched to the rafters. His characterization seemed more in line with the Saberhagen book, where Van Helsing is depicted as more of a religious fanatic with a cruel streak.The whole enterprise was a cash grab for Coppola who was coming off the relative disappointment of The Godfather Part III. It was a success, and kickstarted a ""prestige horror"" trend over the next several years, with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Wolf, and Interview with the Vampire.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Treat For The Eyes And Ears,"As is the case with many of these latter-day horror movies, this is visually stunning. This one is particularly so, with beautiful colors, wild special effects, lavish sets and a handful of pretty women, led by Winona Ryder.It isn't all beauty; there are some horrific, bloody moments in here. I've seen the film three times and the first two times was terrifying to me in parts. The last viewing wasn't as scary, but maybe I was distracted by seeing this on DVD for the first time, which enhanced the visuals and added some nice 5.1surround sound.At two hours and 10 minutes, it's a bit long but there are very few lulls, if any. Gary Oldham gives his normal intense performance as Dracula and it never hurts to have Anthony Hopkins in the film.The only negative I found was Keannu Reeves, who sounds a bit wooden in his lines. Is it my imagination, or is he a terrible actor? Maybe it's just his voice. Nonetheless, Cary Elwes, Richard Grant, Sadie Frost and Bill Campbell all give good support to this film which is a real feast for the senses.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Pompous, overblown, flawed...but not without merit","BRAM STOKER'S Dracula is a lavishly Gothic adaptation of the Stoker novel, directed by Francis Ford Coppola like he's doing an imitation of Tim Burton. This is Dracula as high camp, with a highly theatrical performance from Gary Oldman (with tongue firmly in cheek) playing the Count as both an old-time romantic and modern-day ghoul. Let's be clear: Oldman's performance is far from definitive (that honour goes to Christopher Lee), but it is memorable.Elsewhere, the film is hit and miss. For every hit there's a miss, for every great idea there's one that doesn't work. The art direction and set dressing is top notch, and I appreciate all the artiness of the direction; the stuff in the skies, the blood fountains like something out of Kubrick's THE SHINING, the overblown musical score. Elsewhere, the special effects have dated considerably, particularly Dracula's transformation into a cheesy giant bat. Plus the whole romantic sub-plot drags things down and goes nowhere.The cast is equally mixed. Anthony Hopkins really gets into the spirit of the thing, delivering a performance loaded with high camp as Van Helsing. Tom Waits's Renfield is arresting, Cary Elwes and Richard E. Grant are fine in minor parts, and somehow Sadie Frost works as the sexually frustrated Lucy. But two of the main parts are given to Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder, and it's clear from the outset that their hearts aren't really in it. They give dejected, dispirited and artificial performances, which isn't great.Still, with all the gory effects and imaginative interludes on offer, BRAM STOKER'S Dracula is a film that it's hard to dislike. Indeed, when I first saw it as a 14-year-old boy, I loved it to bits. Many years later, it feels deeply flawed, a movie that's all over the place. Coppola's scattershot film-making works in some places and not in others, and it's fair to say this is a bit of a mess. A riotous, entertaining mess, but a mess nonetheless.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of Coppola's Best,"Though I did not read the book and can't compare it to the movie, I found Bram Stoker's Dracula quiet excellent. The costume design, lighting, camera work, make-up-fx are all very good and make for a very atmospheric movie.There are some truly outstanding things in this film.1, the editing... excellent, I love the way they worked with dissolves, the hypnotic feel they created with the careful editing. Every frame flows in the other, the whole style grabs you and never lets you go... I simply could not turn my eyes off the screen.2, the acting... Gary Oldman is THE Dracula, IMO. Seductive, strong, bad and scary in his own distinctive way, yet really romantic.Hopkins is funny as Van Helsing and quiet ironic.Winona is a great Mina. Beautiful, innocent. She looks great in these Victorian costumes.Keanu Reeves is not as bad as many of you think. He makes the best of his underwritten character.3, the Score... haunting, romantic, scary. It works beautiful with the pictures.I think this movie is a great cinematic achievement and very underrated. It's a shame they don't make movies like that any more.10/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best Dracula Adaption to date.,"After seeing this movie, I feel it is perhaps the best Dracula adaption to date despite some created plot info.  The mood the movie sets is absolutely wonderful.  However, the story sometimes can lose you until it brings you on track.  The added plot info of Dracula having a lost love does work for a little while until Dracula starts to become a tragic villain where you pity him.  I personally feel that Keanu Reeves didn't do that bad of a job, but the character he played could have been given to a better actor.  All in all, this is the best Dracula adaption and movie to date.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Imperfect, Thrilling And Never A Dull Moment","Coppola's take on one of horror's sacred texts was divisive at the time of release; well, I say divisive ... but I'm the only person I remember loving it. But time plays tricks. It's faithful to the text - at least more than most adaptations; in and of itself that's not necessarily a good or bad thing. But Coppola's high-wire act of excess makes it work brilliantly, and it's aged very well ... who knew that the man who made The Godfather could make a good film?Hopkins and Reeves excepted (whose idea were their interpretations?), there are some terrific performances, and I seriously doubt if Gary Oldman has ever had more fun as an actor than he does here. The almost entirely in-camera approach to visual effects lends the film an otherworldly, chilling air; there are some dazzlingly brilliant transitions that speak to the film's technical mastery. It's not afraid to be many things; camp, funny, exciting, disturbing, erotic, and romantic, all in the right proportions and at the right times. It's also unafraid to make Dracula himself, ultimately, something of the story's romantic hero and to see the events of the story through the female gaze as much as the male.Ultimately it's one of those films that's imperfect and all the better for it; it has hopelessly high ambitions, but its failure to reach some of them (but by no means all) is still thrilling. You can't possibly be bored.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Interesting and Mostly Accurate Take on the Horror Classic.,"""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" is one of those films that reeled people in by making its audience believe that it would be an intense horror film on par with productions like ""Rosemary's Baby"" or ""The Exorcist"". Instead, director Francis Ford Coppola stayed more true to Stoker's novel and put a focus on an intense love story that transcends time, the elements and even life and death. This naturally turned off many horror enthusiasts who would rather see a film that thrives on shock value rather than a movie that thrives on heart, brains and emotion. The film is naturally about the titled character, an immortal man (played superbly by the nearly always exceptional Gary Oldman) who has turned against God and now lives through the powers of darkness. By the late-19th Century, the titled character is trying to lure back a reincarnation of his one true love (Winona Ryder) and of course attempting to eliminate all those that might stand in his way (Ryder's fiance Keanu Reeves and professor Anthony Hopkins most notably). Overall ""Dracula"" is an amazingly good looking film that benefits from high production values and guaranteed performances (mainly from Oldman and Hopkins). Coppola's direction is strong, but a bit overbearing at times and sometimes it is unclear what the tone of the production truly is. Watch for Italian beauty Monica Bellucci as one of Oldman's beautiful, but deadly wives. 4 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,Horror
An imaginative but heavily flawed adaptation of the Stoker classic.,"At some point or other, everyone watches a 'Dracula' film. Some people will remember Bela Lugosi's seminal portrayal of the vampire; others will think of Christopher Lee and the Hammer horrors. Fourteen years ago, the legend behind 'The Godfather' brought us a different, more imaginative type of adaptation. Whilst Coppola doesn't work with Stoker's work as well as Puzo's, his film holds several significant merits. Before I talk about the performances, I must commend the crew members responsible for the make-up, costumes and special effects, as 'Dracula' is a near-unparalleled visual experience. Too often, the people tasked with refining a film, enlivening its characters and placing them within a vibrant environment are forgotten by audiences. The scale of the 'Dracula' crew's feats has secured them a place in the vivid memory of film fans, and should continue to do so for a long time. Equally memorable are some of the performances. Gary Oldman is one of the greatest working actors, and his excellence as Bram Stoker's legendary villain makes Coppola's 'Dracula' worthwhile. The then-recent star of 'The Silence of the Lambs', Anthony Hopkins, delivers a similarly enjoyable performance, although the visual and written restrictions placed on character of Dr Van Helsing prevents him from ever wresting the spotlight from Oldman. Another decent performance is provided by Winona Ryder. I wouldn't place her in the same category as Oldman and Hopkins, but she manages to play a fairly boring part with conviction. Now for the elephant in the room¬Ö You could fill the pages of 'War and Peace' with a compilation of criticisms regarding the casting of Keanu Reeves as Jonathan Harker, and so I won't go into detail on this issue. It should certainly be acknowledged, though, as it has to be one of the worst casting choices to ever take place in a major Hollywood film. The atmosphere developed by Oldman's outstanding acting is awfully diminished in scenes involving Harker, and so Coppola's 'Dracula' never becomes the horror it has the potential to be. The film, probably for this reason, feels longer than its runtime of 128 minutes; at least half an hour longer. It's worth enduring, however, as the inevitable climactic scene does not disappoint. Overall, Coppola's 'Dracula' bears some significant flaws, but accomplishments in visual style and dramatic performance make it a rather enjoyable film.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Stunning,"First of all, sorry for my English: I'm Italian and I don't know if I am able to express not in my language my thoughts with the proper terms. Anyway, I loved this movie, even if I agree that the title should have been F.F.Coppola's Dracula. In fact it is a very personal read of the original script. So, I can understand, but not agree, with all critics about important differences to Bram Stoker's masterpiece. It's a movie you can love or hate, there is no midway, as all comments prove. Personally, I loved the way Coppola reviewed the classic tale, giving Dracula a reason to be what he became after the loss of his wife e to search in England the reincarnation of his lost love. Gary Oldman is absolutely fantastic, lavish, romantic,chilling, in particular as he plays an old Dracula in the beginning of the movie. Definitely the best character of his career until now (let's see how he portrays Churchill in the Darkest Hour). Winona Ryder is so sweet and adorable that I forgive the fact she hasn't been the best choice to play Mina. The other actors (except for Keanu Reeves, completely outcast and unable to act) are all good choices. The music is wonderful, as cinematography, art/set direction, make up and costumes (who cares if Dracula wears John Lennon style sunglasses...). This Dracula is seductive as no other movies ever showed and as no other actor was able to portrait the dark prince. By the way, the choice of Keanu Reeves and some screenplay bad errors and holes don't allow to give a 10. But at the same time I can understand it's not a movie for all tastes. As I already written, you can love or hate it.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

An Artistically Rendered Tale Of Darkness,"The most famous vampire in the history of literature and film is brought graphically to life in `Bram Stoker's Dracula,' directed by Francis Ford Coppola, and starring Gary Oldman as the Count from Transylvania.  Working from a screenplay (by James Victor Hart) that is a faithful adaptation of the novel, Coppola takes an artistic approach to the material and creates some startling and effective images-- some quite intense and erotic-- to tell the story of Count Dracula and his world of the undead.  Unsettling at times, and often shocking, the film is mesmerizing and thoroughly engrossing, delivered with a full palette of colors and shadows that form a backdrop against which the characters so vividly emerge to play out the drama.  It's a visual and emotional feast that is satisfying in every respect, beginning with a brief history of Dracula and the circumstances of his life that ultimately allied him with the forces of darkness and evil. 	Initially, the casting of Gary Oldman as Dracula seemed inauspicious and ill advised; in retrospect, the choice of Oldman was inspired.  Though many actors have done the role before and since (Schreck, Lugosi and Lee, just to name a few), Oldman manages to make the character uniquely his own, with a nuanced performance infused with depth and acuity.  Even when delivering famous, oft quoted lines from previously filmed versions of the story (Lugosi's `Children of the night, what music they make,' for instance), Oldman makes them spontaneous and fresh, with a conversational tone that makes you feel as if you're hearing them for the first time.  His presence is self-assured and menacing, which makes the character strong and intimidating, and you sense his longevity and the dark wisdom afforded him by his many years of existence.  There is a fastidiousness about Oldman's methods of inhabiting a character that makes you wonder if there is anything as an actor that is beyond his grasp.  At this point, I would think not. 	As Van Helsing, Anthony Hopkins puts his personal stamp on a well known character as well.  His portrayal of the famous professor is zealous and lively, and touched with an eccentricity that makes him an interesting and welcome presence in the film.  Winona Ryder, too, gives a believable performance as Mina, a somewhat emotionally challenging role she addresses with the restraint demanded of her by the character.  With her dark, winsome looks and natural intensity she is perfect for the part, and displays a femininity that contrasts well with the overt sexuality of Dracula's three `brides.'  And Tom Waits gives a memorable performance as the mad, insect-eater, Renfield, as does Sadie Frost, as Lucy, Mina's young and nubile best friend who unwittingly falls prey to Dracula's dark powers.  The single member of the cast who seems to struggle a bit with characterization is Keanu Reeves, as Jonathan Harker; he gives a passable performance, but fails to ever get a firm grasp of the character.  Still, he has an engaging presence and, though lacking depth, his portrayal is at least credible enough to maintain the continuity of the film. 	The supporting cast includes Richard E. Grant (Dr. Seward), Cary Elwes (Lord Holmwood) and Bill Campbell (Quincey).  Exacting in detail and imaginatively rendered, Coppola's `Bram Stoker's Dracula,' is an impressive, memorable film.  By boldly juxtaposing images and shadows, embracing the innate sensuality of the vampire, and blending it all together so seamlessly, Coppola has taken his film, not only to the zenith of the horror genre, but beyond.  It's a journey into the regions beyond the known, wherein the forces of darkness thrive and survive; a cinematic experience you'll not soon forget, courtesy of Coppola, a superlative cast, and the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Hammy Horror,"DRACULA gets off to a great start as 15th century Romania finds itself on the front line against muslim hordes charging into Europe leading to a Romanian hero losing the love of his lifeThat`s the best part of the film . Other good aspects of DRACULA carry on throughout the movie , aspects like the very moody cinematography and the very impressive visual tricks , but there`s things that clog up the works , things like the intrusive ham acting on display . A lot of people have commented on Anthony Hopkins ham performance but I don`t have a problem with it and neither do I have a problem with Gary Oldman`s performance either . I do however have a problem with Sadie Frost`s performance as Lucy and Tom Waits as Renfield , both give over emphatic performances while both Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder are utterly unconvincing as 19th characters from England ,both are miscast and they`re not even bad enough to be entertaining. Francis Ford Coppola`s directing style may lead to accusations of "" ham "" directing  ie over directing but it should be remembered this directing style was very common in the early 1990s and a lot of American directors did this most notably Martin Scorsese and Oliver Stone . I do wish Coppola had more input into the script ( He is one of the best and most under rated screenwriters Hollywood has produced ) because the one here by James V Hart isn`t all that good . The dialogue isn`t memorable and in several scenes , especially romantic ones , it`s rather corny . It`s also rather over long and not very well paced , but I`m led to believe Bram Stoker`s novel is badly structured but even so that`s no excuseThis version of Dracula has its moments but it`s never the sum of its parts. It`s probably Coppola`s best film since APOCALYPSE NOW  but can anyone name me a good film he`s made since the surreal `Nam epic ?",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Blood Is Life,"This is definitely the best film adaptation of Dracula's character.Gary Oldman is fantastic as Dracula, and the whole casting is great.

The details are subtle and carefully run through the story making this a great film experience. The start of the film is particularly impressive, and Dracula's armour is amazing.Dracula is a story about sinking into evil, a story about redemption and the search for love. Narratively well composed, this film is a true example of how to turn a book into a film.Gary Oldman is an excellent choice for the role of Count Dracula, the casting in general is excellent. Anthony Hopkins is interesting and funny in the role of Van Hellsing, but the other actors also did a great job.The costume design is great, the makeup department really did a great job, There are some minor gripes, but they are so few that they are not even worth mentioning. The impression of the film is surrealistic, the colours and composition are interesting and fully correspond to the theme and story of the film.The very beginning of the film is impressive, it shows despair and anger and ultimately all that is born out of it.What is really interesting is that Dracula is not a simple villain, he is layered and at some points we understand him and sympathize with him, even though his actions are monstrous.

A rich telling near the source material,"Opening with his vow to rise from his grave and take revenge on a God who allowed his beloved to die while he defended Him on the battlefield, we see Count Dracula in the 1890's, conducting business with a London firm.  When his first consultant goes mad, Jonathon Harker is sent to Dracula in his place, only to find himself trapped in the castle.  Meanwhile, Dracula travels to London where he feeds on the lovely Lucy Westenra.  Her various suitors try to help her and call for Professor Van Helsing to come and help ¬ñ they realise that this is not a simple battle against a disease of the blood.Although a little too long for my liking, this film is a very rich gothic telling of a story that has become watered down slightly with the many different versions of stories with the characters.  Here the basic plot follows the tale from the creation of Dracula, his love and his confrontation with Van Helsing and the various suitors of the lovely Lucy. The story is told with a real respect for the source, perhaps a little too much as it can be a little to heavy and lacking in spark at times.  However, for the most part the gothic telling works very well and feels very lavish and rich.Visually the film is great ¬ñ rich colours in the scenery and costumes really bring the goth out of the film.  Meanwhile Coppola works well with shadows and images in the backgrounds to make the film have the feel of an old silent movie version (eyes in the storm) but with modern standards.  It's not really scary, but I didn't need it to be, I was more interested in the overall story, and that worked well.The cast suffer from a bit too much respect for the material, some of their performances are a little too hammy and heavy.  Oldman is good when compared to the better known image of the `Bela Lagosi' Dracula, but I did still find him a little too hammy at times.  Likewise Rider is not totally convincing. Hopkins is quite fun to watch and the three suitors (including Ewles and Grant) very much play stiff upper lipped straight men!  Of course of their performances tower with majesty above the sheer miscast ineptitude of Reeves.  From the start his accent is horrid, but his inability to bring out emotions and character basically kills his character off before the film has even got going.Despite this the film is actually very enjoyable even if it is a bit too respectful and long ¬ñ occasionally making it feel a little heavy going.  The rich presentation and loyalty to the source material makes for a very enjoyable story even if it isn't really what we'd see now as a horror.",,Anonymous,Horror

Lush and Sensual,"This one really nails it.  Lush, sensual, sexy\gory, beautiful and creepy. With just the right touch of humor to keep it in perspective. Tom Waits as Renfield gone bonkers is great comic relief.  Nosferatu of 1922 or Werner Herzog's version of 1979 are also very good but they've got nothing on this one. It stands well with them and is a must for any Vampire story lover. This one pulls of Dracula's story in high style!  One of Coppola's Best works.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Accurate yet very off,"As far as chain of events go, it's the closest adaptation I've seen of the book. But, while playing that true to the book, each character is quite different. There was only one seen in the movie where I saw the books Dracula come forward. When the brides are attacking Harker, Dracula frightens them away, gives them a poor baby to feed on, but then turns to Harker and laughs evilly. THAT is the Dracula Bram Stoked created. But once he arrived in London (in the movie) he suddenly becomes a lover that only wants to have his wife. Van helsing is also a puzzle. He is a sacred minded person but then he is laughing and excited that Lucy became a vampire and that Dracula is in his midst.So, as a vampire movie it's ok. But, character wise it is EXTREMELY unfaithful to the book.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bram Stoker's Dracula,"Gary Oldman is super in this hammy reimagining of the tale of the legendary Count Dracula. Having lured his lawyer - the unsuspecting, and frankly rather insipid, ""Harker"" (Keanu Reeves) to his Transylvanian Castle he employs cunning and guile to use him to acquire ""Carfax Abbey"" in England. He also has designs on the young man's glamorous fianc√©e ""Mina"" (Winona Ryder) and is soon set to acquire much more than just the eerie stately pile. Luckily, ""Prof. Van Helsing"" (Anthony Hopkins) is on hand to help our rather hapless hero and perhaps they can thwart the evil intentions of their vampiric visitor? Francis Ford Coppola presents us here with a highly stylised interpretation of the legend. At times it does border on the Hammer style of production with the gore and peril really unconvincing for most of the film. The heavily made up Reeves is easy enough on the eye, but his accent is tougher on the ears and his performance is more about box office than generating any sense of menace as his red-clothed nemesis marauds around in a wig Marie Antoinette would have found fitting. It does send itself up, and that works - there is plenty that is theatrical about it, and that is what helps make this iteration distinctive. Oldman looks even inch the megalomaniac as he effortlessly glides, purrs and munches his way from Romania to Victorian England. Ryder delivers well - her part has very little substance to it, yet she does rise above the all too obvious damsel in distress persona. There are also valuable supporting efforts from Richard E. Grant and the eagle eyed might spot sword and sandals veteran Jay Robinson as ""Hawkins"". Wojciech Kilar's score helps create quite an atmosphere too, especially as we enter the last half hour of against the clock drama. I didn't much care for the way the ending is portrayed but after two hours of quickly paced and colourful entertainment, that maybe didn't matter so much. This really does need big screen visuals to have any real impact, and if you can find a cinema screening then this is very much at the better end of the Dracula genre of output - even if it does play rather fast and loose with the book!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"After Gary Oldman as Dracula, there is no other Dracula","This movie I feel has not gotten high enough vote in your system. Therefore I gave it 10 points despite a few details that would normally deprive it of one point.These are firstly that the character of Jonathan does not measure up to the standards of the rest of the actors. The second little detail is the scene with the party where Lucy joins together her worshipers. Quincy is holding his hat in front of the sofa when Lord Holmwood arrives. The next time we see him he is given his hat with apologies from the doctor Jack Seward who apparently has sat down on the hat. He already sat there in the former scene when Quincy is holding the hat. Very irritating with such a big blunder in a super movie like that. Now, what makes the movie a ""tenner"" is everything else, in particular Gary Oldmans interpretation of the count, and Anthony Hopkins as doctor van Helsing.The scene with Mina and Dracula in bed is one of the greatest romantic scenes ever, and sure to make any girl cry.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Another film that failed to be better than it was.,"This movie is one of those films that could have been better than it was. Instead I felt the movie was ruined with too many special effects, which I think took away whatever atmosphere or Gothic creepy ambiance it could have had. Also overdone with the sex scenes which didn't help. Instead of a really good original horror movie what this turned out to be is just another typically bland Hollywood blockbuster. Full of flash and erotica but with little substance, that seems so typical of the usual Hollywood productions.Also it has been advertised as being based accurately on Bram Stoker's novel which isn't completely true. In original story there was no romance between Mina Harker and Dracula. Also there was never any mention of Mina being a reincarnation of Dracula's dead wife. That and his wife committing suicide in the beginning of the film was simply added into the movie to turn this into a romance story.It's one of those films that I found disappointing or a real letdown. I couldn't help but feel that it could have been way better than it was.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Maybe if the movie was more about that and less about sex, things would be different. There waw completely new story line added that was taking screen time and that also did not leave much for the developing the characters. So many good actors yet not a good movie.

A different but very good take on the Bram Stoker novel.,"This 1992 version of the Bram Stoker novel is different from the previous Dracula movies that were made in 1931, 1958 and 1979. The visual style is stunning and I just love they way they handled the characters.Without a doubt the best thing about this movie is Gary Oldman in his role as the blood sucking count from Transylvannia. His Dracula is like a mix of the scary looking Nosferatu from ""Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens"" and the gentleman and sensual Dracula played by Bela Lugosi and Christopher Lee in the earlier versions. The result is a Dracula that we can both fear and feel for. Yes, Gary Oldman really is my favorite Dracula (although not the best). The sequences between Oldman and Winona Ryder are really steamy, that was quite some passion on screen!The movie handles all of the characters very well. All of the classic characters are present (Van Helsing, Mina, Harker, Renfield etc.). All of the characters are really deepen out, something that was not really the case in earlier Dracula movies which only really focused on Dracula's character. But that also brings me to the one problem I had with this movie. It focused on too many characters. It was kind of weird, in the beginning it only focused on Harker and Dracula, in the second halve mainly on Mina and the third halve mainly on Van Helsing, it was very inconsistent all.Not only the main cast but also the supporting cast consists out of big names like Cary Elwes, Bill Campbell and Monica Bellucci.The musical score by Wojciech Kilar is really on of the best and most fitting scores in movie history. I love it!The visual style, cinematography, make-up, clothing, acting, music, everything is nearly perfect in this movie! It might not be everyone's cup of tea but I really love this movie!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Then he's Vlad, then he's Dracula or something, and it goes on and on like that, I didn't like this movie that much, it was quite interesting in the beginning but it just confused me greatly, the actors where well played but as i already said, confusing. I'm not telling with this review that the movie was awful but just really weird and confusing, also I didn't get the places that much, where it played and how the story was building up, that was also quite weird, even so..

Visually stunning!! a classic,"Francis Ford Coppala's approach is unlike Bram Stoker's famous book, not horror, but more an approach to the Love-side of the story. There still is a lot of horror in the film that really frightens you, but the story is more centerd around the tragic lovelife of count Dracula. Also, another thing that makes this movie a really fascinating movie experience, is because of some erotic scenes. They make the scenes extremely powerful which really helps to power the emotion and the horror. It also makes it the most erotic Dracula film ever.The movie is made with beautiful sets and colour. There is a real colour theme going on in the movie that is truly maqnificent and which pleases the eye. The use of music and sound is also fantastically done. It makes it more frightening and exciting. The casting of this masterpiece is absolutely perfect. Gary Oldman plays the count Dracula with true emotion and lust. He steals the show. Also, Winona Ryder as the lovely Mina does a fantastic job. With further rolls of Anthony Hopkins as the professor Van Hesling,(who plays him with lots of joy and wickedness. He is the one who brings some humor into the dark world the movie is in), Keanu Reaves as Jonathan (A great choice for the part), and Sadie Frost as Lucy (Who really acts great! She made quite an impression on me because she played Lucy perfectly) makes this a wonderful movie experience.So are you in for a night of Horror, Erotica, Love, Action, great special effects and a lot of Vampire teeth? Than ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" is the movie for you to see. This movie will truly amaze you from beginning to end. When the credits role over the screen, you do understand the tagline of the movie: Love Never Dies. Worth viewing many times!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Grandeur of the Piece.,"There will never be a more sexually drawing and enticing performance of Dracula then there was in this. Gary Oldman has been the best and, most likely, always will be. His ability to use several accents makes his Dracula a dark, mysterious, sexually arousing lover and character. It makes some forget the true horror he is supposed to instill, but that shall never be a problem in my book. It would have received a 10 if Lucy's lovers didn't always seem to be sucking up to her or another one person. They just seemed to be constantly quarreling in their minds about one another and always trying to win Lucy from Arthur! This should of course seem normal, but just makes them seem weak. Overall though this movie is great for Romance and slight amounts of Horror.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Loyal story-line, excessive image","In giving an image to a story written on a book, I suppose there's a very complex difficulty with interpretation. Everyone has a different conception of characters as described in books: we all build the image that best suits the given description by the author, using as many resources as we possess.But in Coppola's film, it is just too extravagant, too excessive. If looked through the filter of Bram Stoker's novel ‚Äìconsidering the title of the movie itself declares to be loyal to the author's name, I don't find other filters to be more accurate‚Äì, the image portrayed by Coppola is a disgrace.I must say that the story-line is quite complete and does not contain unnecessary changes such as in Browning's version (1931) or in Herzog's (1979), regarding who leads the actions. What these two lack in story-line, Coppola's lacks in image (or exceeds in it and takes it off track). Characters like Jonathan Harker, Quincey Morris and Abraham Van Helsing in Coppola's version are quite well-made; while Lucy Westenra is a complete disaster.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Simply one of the best films of all time,"This has to go down in film history as one of the greatest films that has ever been produced. As someone who is deeply interested in vampires and a big fan of the ""Dracula"" novel, I have been dying to see this film for years and when I first saw it about eighteen months ago it quite simply blew me away. This is the definitive film version of Bram Stoker's novel, and if anyone is not stunned by the magnificence of this film or the phenomenally good performance of Gary Oldman in the title role, then I think they should be checked for a pulse. This film left me literally speechless, and compared to the Christopher Lee versions of the 1950s, '60s and '70s, it stands up as being the most accurate and faithful screen adaptation of the novel that has ever been made. So all in all, this film is the one that any fan of the novel should see first, and I think once they have seen the Lee versions they will agree that this film is the very best and the most faithful to Stoker's novel.To start with, Gary Oldman is the personification of the Dracula portrayed in the novel. Apart from looking almost exactly how the centuries-old vampire is described in the novel, his vocal and bodily performance is so unbelievably good that it will leave you transfixed. He wonderfully combines Dracula's charm, grace, sinister aspects, desire for revenge against God, lust for the women who surround themselves around Johnathan Harker, Van Helsing, Arthur Holmwood and Dr. Seward, and of course his thirst for human blood. He also portrays the lover who has lost his beloved to a remarkably good degree, and his superb acting of the scenes on the bed with Mina Harker brings a lump to the throat and a tear to the eye. It is often said that an actor's performance is ""electric,"" but even that isn't enough to describe the brilliance of Oldman as Dracula. ""Stunning,"" ""wonderful,"" or ""magnificent"" are closer to the mark when describing Oldman's portrayal. His sinister exclamation of Dracula's famous quote, ""Listen to them, the children of the night, what sweet music they make"" is particularly outstanding.The other characters from the novel - Johnathan Harker (the estate agent who first meets Dracula), Mina Harker (his bride and the object of Dracula's affections), Lucy Westenra (Mina's friend), Arthur Holmwood (Lucy's husband-to-be), Quincey Morris (a Texan), Dr. Seward (a medical man) and Van Helsing (a professor and part-time vampire hunter) - are also brilliantly portrayed and given enough screen time to allow their characters to be developed as much as they need to be. Keanu Reeves is an excellent Johnathan Harker, sufficiently afraid while in Dracula's castle and determined enough to kill him back in England; Winona Ryder is a fantastic Mina/Elisabeth; Sadie Frost is a superb sweet, naive and flirtatious Lucy; Arthur, Seward and Quincey are portrayed well and make excellent vampire hunters; and Anthony Hopkins as Van Helsing is ten times better than the Peter Cushing version and a million miles closer to the eccentric genius portrayed in the novel. These characters, and Dracula himself, are portrayed beautifully and accurately in James V. Hart's stunning script, which adheres quite closely to Stoker's novel, including extracts from the novel and sufficient explanations to allow those who have not read the novel to understand and follow the plot.The superb direction by Francis Ford Coppola is beyond any faults, and his handling of the bed scenes between Dracula and Mina is enough to bring out all the raw emotions and tears among the audience, let alone between the two characters themselves! The script is pure excellence and the prologue about Vlad the Impaler losing his bride (Elisabeth) after a battle between his people (the Transylvanians) and the Turks, then in his grief denying God's existence and avenging her death by becoming a vampire (i.e. Dracula) is superb and brings all the beliefs that Dracula was partly inspired by the real Vlad the Impaler bursting into a new light, and makes Dracula a sympathetic and tragic character, instead of the charming but deadly ladies' man as portrayed by Lee. The use of Romanian language in the prologue and later in the film adds authenticity to a beautiful and tear-jerking adaptation of the novel.The music is one of the very best as heard in a film, and in places is so utterly fantastic it could almost be an undiscovered Beethoven's symphony. The scenery and costumes are beyond criticism, and offer a real sense of Transylvanian and English culture and tradition respectively. Dracula's red cloak, trailing behind him like a sea of blood, and the gold dragon on his chest (suggesting he is the dragon to Van Helsing's St. George) is wonderfully designed. The make-up of the elderly Dracula is sufficiently corpse-like yet alive enough to suggest quite rightly that Dracula is caught between life and death by his vampire's existence. The half-man, half-wolf and the half-man, half-bat versions of Dracula are wonderfully created with make-up and special effects (bearing in mind this film was made in 1992) and the death of Dracula at the end (his throat slashed by Johnathan Harker and his heart impaled by Quincey Morris) is beautifully written, acted and directed, and the scene where he reverts back to the young Vlad the Impaler and is finally allowed to die with Mina (the reincarnation of Elisabeth - hence his affections towards her) next to him is so tear-jerkingly wonderful it leaves a lasting impression on the viewer.Stunning. Truly stunning. There's nothing more to be said about it.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great visuals, great names but...","Well, it took me 30 years to see this movie. Back in the day a lot of my friends had seen it and they were very impressed.I am too, but not with everything. Actually, not with a lot of things. As many wrote, the setup, the costumes and cinematography are impressive. But unfortunately that's not the whole pie.Let's start with the storytelling. The movie starts very promising when portraying the pain Dracula goes through. But from that point on, the story starts to jump from one point to another and to be perfectly honest; very soon it starts to suck.The characters, maybe except Dracula are very shallow, I think the problem here is, there's to many of them too close to the story so there is no real focus on anything really.The editing is terrible. Plain and simple. I mean you have this fantastic compound and chop up the scenes and create a trash-sort thing.The acting, well, some people said it: Keanu Reeves, whom I like very much, doesn't belong in this movie. Winona Ryder is ok, yet not her best performance.And then there's Gary Oldman. That guy truly got this and I have to say he's the most convincing in this movie. Anthony Hopkins' performance is more a comedy appearance than anything else, sorry to say, but I found him the most annoying in this flick.All in all the movie isn't bad. Absolutely not. I just don't think it's well scripted, directed and acted piece of work, especially when seeing all these big names.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
An Art Piece of Strangeness Come To Life,"Nothing is better than the original. But this movie is a classic in its own way. It shows the story of Dracula in a much darker, sensual and weird way. That really makes you feel the utter strangeness of a world where Dracula exists.Personally I found the movie a little too strange. Most movies make vampires and werewolves into a fun and exciting thing. But this movie made it into a horror. It did not hide the ugliness of dark beings. Instead it brought out the strangeness of it all, to really make you feel pure unease.The cast was phenomenal. Keanu Reeves the poor innocent who was fully touched by darkness and managed to escape its grasp. He was so young and yet brilliant. Winona Ryder the dainty, delicately beautiful women who is lost in a love story. Anthony Hopkins who has a small part as Van Helsing, as always is magnificent with his passion and strength. And Gary Oldman as Dracula. He came across so sly and ""off"". Every time I kept looking at him I thought of johnny Depp. The cast really brings the movie to life.The film is filled with beautiful sets and costumes. It's well constructed and clearly artful.

Coppola's commercial classic...,"While Bram Stoker's Dracula was being made, the press made a lot of stink regarding this as Coppola's ""Cape Fear"", referring to Scorsese's big-budget remake of the original of 1962.  Scorsese did a commendable update of that flick, but Coppola, a director known for his eccentricity and innovation, has taken an old myth and turned it upside down.  I've never seen such visual effects, creating an expressionistic mood that would make F.W. Murnau (director of 1922's silent Nosferatu) proud.  This is German Expressionism and Dali mixed together in color. On top of its visual power is the treatment of the Dracula story, remaining very faithful to Stoker's vision.Gary Oldman turns in his best performance to date, both terrifying and compassionate, and is the most frightening Count since Max Schreck donned the Dracula gear back in the 1922 original.  He takes on forms past filmmakers could only dream of putting on film.  Obviously, the chemistry between Winona Ryder & Oldman is there.  Hopkins is solid as always playing Professor Van Helsing, who has a few supernatural tricks of his own.  Of course, Keanu Reeves is as solid as a piece of plywood, but that's another story.It's the visuals and effects that really put an auteur's mark on the picture. You can tell a lot of money was spent, but Coppola utilizes every penny (something he has failed to do in some past films i.e. One From the Heart, Rumble Fish).  We see some seriously disturbing images such as eyes in the sky and a stairwell in the Count's castle that seems to go beyond the infinite underneath.  What a movie.  This is a must see for all film fans and a reminder that Francis Ford Coppola has and always will be one of the best directors of all-time.  Just sit back and let the film assault your senses.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Spectacular and lavish version with splendid actors ,  lush photography  , breathtaking set design and brilliant costumes","A young lawyer named Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves, though Coppola has openly criticized his own reasoning for casting Keanu Reeves as Jonathan Harker ; according to him, he needed a young, hot star that would connect with the girls) is assigned to a gloomy village in the mists of eastern Europe . He is captured and imprisoned by a strange vampire and his bloodsucker girlfriends . He really is a 15th-century Romanian warrior who lives on through the ages and gone back life .

And special mention to rousing and powerful musical score composed and conducted by Wojciech Kilar . This thrilling as well as sumptuous film contains horrifying scenes , chills , lots of gore and red jelly was used for the blood . Interesting script by writer James V. Hart , he started writing the screenplay in 1977 ; according to him, David Lean was the first choice to direct the movie, but was unavailable as he was working on Nostromo, which was eventually shelved after his death . Gary Oldman brings something unique to the vampire role, somewhere between Max Schreck's hideous Count Orlok , the debonair Lugosi/Lee/Langela Dracula and a wolfman makeup lookalike , Oldman may well exude some sort of animal magnetism to women, but is still a hideous fanged beast on the prowl . High-budgeted film , though to keep the budget manageable, Columbia insisted that the film be shot in Los Angeles and not on location. Costume designer Eiko Ishioka -who won an Oscar for the movie and previously had dressed in ¬®Mishima¬® produced by Coppola- had never seen a Dracula movie prior to being hired for this film ; she was initially hired as the art director, but when Francis Ford Coppola saw some of her costume sketches, he immediately asked her to work as the costume designer. The motion picture was exquisitely realized by the genius Ford Coppola . The picture achieved success at box office , as earnings from the film was enough to save Zoetrope (Francis Ford Coppola's studio) from bankruptcy after suffering from financial difficulties and liabilities of $27 million over the past 3 years. Dracula deservedly won Academy Awards for editing , sound effects , costume design and makeup.This version of Dracula is closely based on Bram Stoker's 1897 classic novel of the same name ; other films retelling the known legend based as originally conceived on this novel are the following : ""Bram Stoker's Count Dracula"" (1970) by Jesus Franco with Christopher Lee , Hebert Lom , Maria Rohm , Klaus Kinski ; ¬® Dracula¬® (1974) by Dan Curtis with Jack Palance , Simon Ward ,Nigel Davenport , ¬®Bram's Stoker Dracula'with David Suchet as Abraham Van Helsing , Marc Warren as Count Dracula and Sophia Myles as Lucy ; and last version ¬®Dracula¬®2012 by Dario Argento with Rutger Hauer as Abraham Van Helsing , Asia Argento as Lucy , Unax Ugalde as Johnathan Harker and Thomas Kretschmann as Dracula .",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The best Dracula movie ever made.,"I have watched this movie probably ten times. It is no doubt the best Dracula movie ever made. The cinematography is superb, the sound effects are absolutely incredible. It is enchanting, haunting, endearing, and enthralling all at once. It is the type of movie that is done so well it seems there are endless stories within it, and you can certainly lose all sense of yourself when watching it. Absolutely tremendous. Top of the line. A classic for all time. It has a bit of a good western in it, some of the old style early movies, plenty of modern visual effects, a good amount of sexual flair without overdoing it, the enduring innocence of the several young ladies that lighten the screen. The first person storytelling aspect that fades in and out is also a very well done key effect, detaching you from the scenes in an observant listener fashion without danger of entering, allowing you to witness or imagine the coming horror unfolding, then drawing you in deep within the screen until you're lost in it's essence.Tremendous film.

Technically Brilliant,"Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992)** (out of 4)Coppola's big-budget version of the classic story features Gary Oldman as Dracula, Winona Ryder as Mina, Anthony Hopkins as Van Helsing, Keanu Reeves as Harker and Sadie Frost as Lucy. It's doubtful there's a person alive who doesn't know the story of Dracula so there's no point in telling it again so how does this version measure up to previous ones? On one hand this is possibly the greatest looking version but that can't make up for how deadly dull the film is. The beautiful eye candy is certainly something to worship but without the strong story backing it up we're left with a real mixed bag. On a technical level the movie is pretty much flawless as the sets, costumes, editing, special effects and cinematography are all top notch. The beautiful rich colors of the costumes really stand out as does the magnificent looking colors of the sky, the castle and various other items. The special effects are also quite remarkable and especially the ones dealing with the aging Oldman. The way the make up takes Oldman's age from old to young is really a marvel to look at and the fact that the actor can still move and act through it is another major plus. I think Oldman gives one of the most interesting interpretations of the Count and he perfectly nails the tortured soul of the man. Oldman also has a very interesting line delivery, which worked for me as did his rather easy way of getting across his passion. I'm also a fan of Ryder's performance here and the naive quality she brings Mina. Hopkins too gives a strong performance, although I do with he had been given some better scenes to work in. The only one that really doesn't work too well is Reeves who should have never been given this role. While everything on the technical level is masterful, I'd have to blame Coppola for the majority of the film's lacking story. It really feels as if Coppola was so worried with the look that he forgot to do much with the story because in all honesty I was bored from the first ten minutes to the end. The film, running 127 minutes, feels twice as long and I can't help but wonder what went wrong here. I know many are going to get caught up in the story and perhaps rightfully so but this film has never worked for me and it's obvious that it never will. There's a lot to admire here but in the end this goes down as an incredibly flawed but great-looking film.",,Anonymous,Horror
Bram Stoker's Dracula,Dracula (Gary Oldman) meets the woman he once loved but she died 400 years earlier. THe turned his back on the church and went over to the dark side. Mina (Winona Ryder) is now living in Victorian London and engaged to marry lawyer Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves.)Eventually Professor Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins) comes to the rescue after some strange occurrences in London. That includes Harker's predecessor who went insane after travelling to Transylvania.When Bram Stoker's Dracula was released. People questioned should a feted multi Oscar winner be directing a horror film.Well Francis Coppola started out doing horror. Another future Oscar winner who started out as Roger Corman's protege.Coppola was presumably enticed by a big pay cheque as he was heavily in debt due to the failure of his Zoetrope Studio in the 1980s. Columbia Pictures wanted to kickstart a classic horror franchise for a new generation. Next up would be Kenneth Branagh's Frankenstein with Robert De Niro as the Monster.Coppola approaches the movie as a visual filmmaking challenge. It is shot in soundstages and he uses all kinds of techniques. It ranges from CGI to animation to old school movie making. There is an emphasis on art direction and costumes.It gives the film an artificiality. The screenplay just could not keep up.

No Horror Here!,"I was seeking a traditional horror flick that scared the dickens out of me. This production turned out to be a love story instead, a new take on the story of Dracula.

Instead, I saw a bizarre character falling in love with one of his victims. The sets, acting and cinematography were highly polished and professional, but since my pants were still dry afterward, I have to say I could not recommend it as a horror flick.

Beautiful and Terrifying.,"I do enjoy a good horror dip every once in a while, so I was searching on Netflix and found this modern classic. I have to say, it is the most unsettling thing I've sat through in a long time! If you have Netflix, watch this before it goes away!Many Dracula films have taken and added elements from the iconic book. But this is one of the first films to adapt the source material verbatim. A choice that sometimes works in its favour but sometimes doesn't.Directed by the legendary Frances Ford Coppola (The Godfather), this is the film that cemented Dracula's character as a saddened, lovesick soul as well as just a bloodthirsty monster. He is motivated by love rather than just sheer hunger for human blood. The star-studded cast also stands out. Wynona Ryder (Edward Scissorhands) brings a romantic flare and avoids typical tropes of the ""damsel in distress"", and Anthony Hopkins (The Silence of the Lambs) as Van Helsing is a worthy nemesis to the Vampire.The greatest triumph is the Oscar-worthy performance of Gary Oldman (The Dark Knight) as the titular Count Dracula, hungry for the body and blood of a helpless female. He is totally unrecognizable in this movie! The film is acted in such an over-the-top flare, I felt like I was watching a broadway theatre production.The film is in fact, not just horror, but a sort of ""dark romance"" with a beautiful 19th century period pice back drop. Wonderfully shot, each scene is dripping with emotion and passion mixed with terrifying violence and satanic imagery. It feels like watching a nightmare from the mind of a drug addict.The film does get points off for the casting of Keanu Reeves (The Matrix) as the male lead and the cheesy 80's love song for the end credits, but hey, them's the breaks.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Quite impossibly bad,"I must be missing something here, as this is easily one of the most shockingly terrible, tear-my-eyes-out-so-I-don't-have-to-see-it, train wreck mess of an excuse for a film that I have ever had the severe misfortune to bear witness to. I am sitting here in my living room literally unable to come to terms with how execrable this 'film'was.How anyone can think this is good is quite beyond me. A few points: -The look of the film is not 'grandiose' or 'lush', it is crap. The effects are crap, the sets are crap. It's just a royal glut of crapness from start to finish.-Every cast member excerpt Gary Oldman turns in a career-worst performance par excellence.-Calling it 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' is an exercise bordering on the farcical. This film should be called 'Francis Ford Coppola's unashamed molestation of Dracula, aided and abetted by the most staggeringly inept fake English accents ever committed to celluloid'.Keanu Reeves' English accent is (deep breath) worse, yes WORSE than Dick Van Dyke's horrific cockney aberration from Mary Poppins. This in itself is quite an achievement and almost makes the film worth watching. Actually, no it doesn't.To sum up, by all that you hold dear do not watch this film. Spend two hours removing your skin with a power-sander then have a salt bath. It will be a less painful experience. I bid you good day.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

A cinematic masterpiece,"Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula is s cinematic masterpiece. The film is just a beautiful work of art and its without a doubt the most romantic horror film ever made and one of the best movies. Starring a seductive Gary Oldman, a sensual Winona Ryder, Sadie Frost, Cary Elwes and a questionable but handsome Keanu Reeves amongst others. The movie is a sweeping epic about love and death. Its unlike any other film and although it can feel a bit much at times. Its ambitious and creative nature deserves to be commended. It's truly a rare thing for a film especially a studio entry to take so many chances. The end result isn't perfect but its damn near close.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Most Famous Vampire Of All,"Although it is not possible to ever replace Bela Lugosi as Count Dracula, Gary Oldman offers us an interesting interpretation of the most famous of vampires in Francis Ford Coppola's version of Dracula. This film is probably closest to the novel that Bram Stoker wrote which in fact is a series of recollections of the events of the story by its various characters.Added to it is a prequel where we see that the Count back in the 17th century was a warrior repelling the Ottoman Turk invasion. But on arriving home from the wars, Oldman discovers that his beloved has died. Cursing the Deity, the Deity gets back at him by leaving him undead with a thirst for human blood. His beloved is played by Winona Ryder.Flash forward to the end of the 19th century and the story picks up in many ways from the classic film with Bela Lugosi. Dracula has moved his base of operations to London to be near the reincarnated version of his true love, also played by Winona Ryder. She's slightly engaged to Keanu Reeves who is held as a prisoner by Dracula's demon wives after closing the deal on Carfax Abbey in London.Dr. Van Helsing is played by Anthony Hopkins who dusts off the accent that Laurence Olivier perfected back in the day. Hopkins does overact a bit here, but the part is a showy one, almost as much as the title role.I did see a college production of the play made from Stoker's novel and this one was closer than any other Dracula I've seen.But with all due respect to the fine cast involved, there will never be another Bela.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"High-end Vampire myth, still just about sex and blood.","I can't help but get the feeling that critics gave Coppola the benefit of the doubt with so many curiosities in this wide release film, he was of course a much lauded director and just putting his name on the film poster was sure to get asses on seats at the local multiplex.It should be noted that in the early nineties, Oliver Stone's movie the Doors, the deplorably bad Natural Born Killers and of course Bram Stoker's Dracula were all completely overblown in their production design and editing - as if these talented filmmakers had given in to the misguided idea that smothering the narrative in distracting effects and post production tricks would appeal to audiences, rather than confuse them.Dracula is actually a pretty good example of the genre (if ""totally overproduced early nineties movie"" is a genre) in that many of Eiko Ishioka's costume designs are strikingly bizarre or beautiful, the sets are stuffed with opulent Gothic and Victorian decoration, and of course Anthony Hopkins is great as Dr Van Helsing, a remorseless dutch Dr and metaphysician of his time, trying to rid the world of the Nosferatu, played by Gary Oldman.The main problem with this film's ""ambitious set design"" is that it's so often distracting. Some viewers could be wondering why in the films preamble, 15th century Romanian warriors are wearing bizarre red suits of plastic and leather that look nothing remotely suited to the era. The period costumes actually resemble science fiction items from Mario Bava's 1965 film Planet of the Vampires. The heavy religious imagery and chiaroscuro lighting add an impressive renaissance flavor also, but my main complaint is that the ingredients don't really create a convincing narrative whole. The very set-bound and design-oriented nature of the film is impressive, but not convincing.Coppola's intent of course is that it's all visual prosody, i.e: that the film's endless special effects and overstated design are riffing on themes of blood letting, mortality, repression, lust, venereal disease and the corrupt, horrible evil of some ancient ruling class. Good idea, but its all too flashy to truly sink in.The special effects are frequently excellent, as Count Dracula in this picture appears as a person of different physical ages, he casts no reflection, he is a familiar of wolves and bats, and can turn into wolves and bats, also he appears sometimes as a hideous writhing humanoid bat of about seven feet in height. Sometimes he appears as a sickly green fog.You get the idea: in almost EVERY shot in this film, there are visual effects, but also Coppola gives into the temptation to add wacky editing techniques including bits of sped up and slowed down film to create a very opulent period picture that frequently looks like a music video.Ultimately, the film is about two things: lavish production design and sleazy, erotic encounters showing vampire mistresses or Victorian ladies on the verge of orgasm with vampires. It could be a ""comment"" on Victorian sexuality, but more likely its just sleaze for the sake of sleaze, titillating the audience in much the same way that cheap teen comedies of the era liked to depict tall, naked legs or plunging breast shots on the VHS cover.My last issue, as so many raised in 1992 is that Keanu Reeves isn't exactly suited for Gothic material. His previous two hits, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure and Point Break were teen-oriented summertime movies, and while he has on screen sex appeal, his character Jonathan Harker would have benefited greatly from a quality actor, like say Daniel Day Lewis, who could make a realistic effort of the required accent for the part and most importantly his emotive skill would be the focus area of a given scene, two things that Reeves just isn't really capable of.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Shouldn't have done that, could have spend that time watching something better or something I haven't seen before. This movie has so many things wrong with it flow vice. If it was purely a p***rn movie, it could get away with it, but it's not. There is no chemistry between characters, acting is all over the place and the plot (and plot holes) can't carry the movie through all those flaws.

Bram Stoker's classic,"Francis Ford Coppola brings to the screen what is to me THE best film adaptations of the classic novel ever filmed to date. It's well paced, well directed, very atmopsheric and haunting, it's very creepy too. The look of the film is jaw-dropping, combining German expressionism with vivid colors and strange visuals very reminiscent of Argento's Suspiria. Gary Oldman does a great job as the title character, who lives on it's very own, with the scariness of Max Schrek with the subtle seductiveness of Frank Langella. Winona Ryder does a beautiful and convincing portrayal of Mina Murray. Anthony Hopkings is great as Van Helsing, who, whilst stays true to the original, has some Hannibal Lector vibes to him. The only miscast is Keanu Reeves. He really sucks in the role of Jonathan Harker, and was so terribly miscast. It's probably the only thing that really bothered me about the film. The romantic twist in the story is very nice and it's not corny as it may sound, but the film would have worked just as well without it, but still and highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
* * * * out of 4.,"The best film Francis Ford Coppla ever made in my opinion. This magnificent production deals with Count Dracula (Gary Oldman) finding a woman (Winona Ryder) in the 1800's who resembles his long lost love who killed herself many centuries earlier. Gary Oldman turns in the performance of his career with this effort; he is romantic, scary, and captivating while changing from young man to an old ghoulish looking old man to a beast. Winona Ryder also does her best work in this film also; she captures the right balance between innocence and terror. Even Keenua Reeves who was something of a joke at the time of this production is credible. The costumes and sets are lush and breathtaking and the make-up effects are frightening. The film does an admireable job of balancing its romance sub-plot between the terror. And the film is always entertaining and haunting in its own way, especially the ending. The best horror film of the 90's and one of my top 10 favorite films of the 90's!Rated R; Graphic Violence, Nudity, and Sexual Situations.",,Anonymous,Horror
"""Denn die Todten reiten schnell""","Vampires, nosferatu and the undead have become somewhat of a cultural phenomenon over the years, with the countless re-tellings of the primera vampire story that is Dracula. From the publication of Bram Stoker's novel in 1897, it has succeeded in evoking fear and terror into the hearts and minds of the millions who read the Gothic magnum opus. There have been many adaptations of the Dracula story; F.W Murnau's German expressionist masterpiece, Bela Lugosi's elegant and sublime portrayal and Christopher Lee's various 'fangtastic' performances.But for me the most faithful and best movie adaptation of the Bram Stoker novel is without a doubt 1992's aptly named 'Bram Stoker's Dracula'. With Francis Ford Coppola at the helm, what could go wrong? The movie was fabulous, visually stunning and capturing all the various aspects of the Dracula myth; the dark, Gothic horror and romantic sympathetic cruelty of Dracula's fate. And the cast was also fantastic with Gary Oldman doing a great job at the very complex and difficult role of Dracula and Anthony Hopkin's brilliant portrayal of his nemesis Professor Abraham Van Helsing. Winona Ryder was wonderful as Mina Murray as was Richard E Grant and Sadie Frost as Dr. Jack Seward and Lucy Westerner respectively. But the only disappointment was Keanu Reeves as Jonathan Harker. What horrible casting! Reeves' performance was drab and boring from his first terrible lines of dialogue, pulling off a hopeless English accent and making himself look the idiot acting opposite such distinguished actors as Oldman and Hopkins. Despite this little hitch, I felt that 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' was absolutely brilliant, with exceptional performances (minus Keanu), a great script and Coppola's usual genius as a director, this is one the best films of all time. I loved this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the best vampire movies ever made - thanks largely to a fantastic Gary Oldman.,"The many faces (and shapes) of a powerful vampire is so incredibly well illustrated in 'Dracula', or 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' as it is known. Gary Oldman is FANTASTIC as Dracula - probably one of the best Dracula performances I've seen.Jonathan (Keanu Reeves) is working for a law firm and sent to Dracula to present him with the paperwork for property he is a about to purchase - ten houses in precise locations (don't believe they ever mention the significance of this...). On his arrival at Dracula's castle, he soon realizes something sinister going on, and finds himself a prisoner. Sadly, Keanu Reeves is miscast as Jonathan. He is unconvincing, and the character itself is not a character I cared for much. An unknown actor would have been better for the role.Winona Ryder stars as Jonathan's love interest, Mina. But, as mentioned, I didn't really care for their love story since I didn't care for Jonathan. I was far more interested in Lucy (Sadie Frost) - Mina's friend, and ultimately the unconventional love story between Mina and Dracula.The film is constantly foreboding and disturbing, with stunning make-up, costumes and visuals (watch the shadows; it's really creepy!). Anthony Hopkins is very good, as usual, as vampire hunter Professor Van Helsing. Again, I can't stress enough how perfect Gary Oldman was in the role of Dracula! The film does become somewhat weird as the story unfolds, but it is all good. This is a thoroughly enjoyable vampire flick, and stunningly well made.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"The essence of vampires: Alien, erotic and enchanting.","I never was a big fan of vampires, yet one day decided to watch Coppola's take on Dracula.The opening sequence was all it took to convince me. Loud and intense, with visuals so breathtaking and stylish, it left me staring at the screen with my jaw on the floor. I knew i was in for a ride, and the rest of this two hour masterpiece utterly confirmed that.Coppola sucks you into an entirely convincing, dark world with his feverish editing, impressive sets, outstanding costumes, brilliant special effects and the greatest Dracula put on film: Gary Oldman.Oldman's Dracula appears in many different shapes throughout the movie, and he differentiates them brilliantly. Yet, the scenes to burn themselves into your mind will be those of the first act. A legendary outfit (and hairdo!), Coppola's brilliantly creepy shadows and alien moves that would make even Sigourney Weaver shriek in fear make this the most haunting imagery of Dracula yet.As the story unfolds, Coppola adds one more secret sauce to this movie, one that elevates the image of vampires from creepy monsters to darkest fantasy: Sex.In fact, this might just be the most erotic movie you'll ever see. No character is safe from the dark lust Dracula inflicts them with: not even the Count himself. Some scenes might outright shock you in how blatantly they display the unstoppable desire for sex that the characters display. From the first innocent chuckling at pornographic drawings in a book, to a half-naked maiden gone mad with lust, Coppola's Dracula is in control more than anything else because of his erotic aura that redefines how we perceive the vampire myth.The tag line for this movie states ""Love never dies"". Indeed, this story is a tragic romance underneath it all. If you can embrace this reinterpretation of the original story, it all concludes so wonderfully, the story of Dracula becomes much more coherent. It makes sense.In short, this is the greatest depiction of vampires ever put to film. A visual delight, with technical excellence displayed by director, costumers and a brilliant Gary Oldman. A feverish, sexual depiction that will leave drops of sweat on your forehead. An interpretation of Dracula that does not stray far, but makes the viewer understand the shadowy figure better than any attempt has before or after.A masterpiece and the essential Dracula put on film.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
I don't care what you guys say,The movie starts off with a couple scenes that are too artsy so they seem cheesy but as the movie progresses it gets much better. There is some amazingly shot scenes and the actors (except Keanu Reeves who's accent isn't believable) do an incredable job portraying the characters. Gary Oldman should have won an Academy Award for his acting and if not him it should have gone to Anthony Hopkins who plays three roles. This movie only got 7.1 (when i wrote this review) but it deserves a 8.5 at least. It is one of my ten favourite movies of all time.

The first five minutes leading to the title is a model in intense and efficient narration that should be mandatory in every film school.

If there were ever a Dracula movie to make you feel pity or sorrow for Count Dracula, then this would be it. Dracula, after all, was a man driven by love--a deep fathomless love that caused him to renounce the Church and live eternally in order to avenge the loss of his love.I guess we can all take a lesson on true love from Dracula? I don't know. I think it went past love and entered the boundaries of worship. He worshipped his lost wife and had a chance to worship her again when a woman named Mina (Winona Ryder) appeared in the likeness of his dead wife 400 years later. The only problem is that Mina was to be betrothed to Jonathan (Keanu Reeves). But that should be no problem for a Count... right?",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Visually Stunning Horror Epic,"Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula is a highly operatic, visually stunning Horror epic that is drenched in eerie gothic atmosphere and haunting surreal imagery that feels very hypnotic as you're watching it.Coppola took many risks with his adaptation of Bram Stoker's iconic novel. Many of those risks, specifically the visual aesthetic and filmmaking techniques, pay off incredibly well creating a Dracula film that is not only one of the most daring and unique adaptations of all time but also one of the most faithful to the novel.But admittedly, there are a few moments in the film that come off a bit goofier than I think were intended. One scene that comes to mind is when Dracula is given a letter written by Mina telling him that she still intends to marry Jonathan Harker. The scene then cuts to Dracula being surrounded by candles and he is seen crying with his face being partially transformed into a monster, but it just looks like he's crying with a goofy rubber mask on.There are a few moments like that when the movie's style can go a little overboard, but for the vast majority of the film, I am fully on board with it. I love all of the costumes, the sets, the makeup, the score, and all of the terrific in-camera visual effects that still look awesome today.Gary Oldman, who is literally great in everything, absolutely kills it as Dracula unsurprisingly. Oldman has an incredible knack for delivering every line with the utmost sincerity even when he's playing a larger-than-life character like Dracula. Anthony Hopkins, who much like Oldman rarely ever turns in a bad performance, is also terrific as Van Helsing. Hopkins's very presence adds a great level of class to the film.But of course, one cannot talk about this movie without mentioning Keanu Reeves's dreadful performance as Jonathan Harker. There really isn't much to say at this point other than yeah, it's bad. I love Keanu but he sticks out like a sore thumb in every scene he's in.Winona Ryder is serviceable in her role, nothing I would call great. When you're acting opposite Gary Oldman, you naturally just need to step your acting game up by a lot. And although Ryder tries, it never fully reaches for me which kind of takes away from their romantic chemistry in my opinion.Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula may not be flawless, but its incredible visuals and haunting atmosphere go a long way to make this film a very engaging and entertaining experience that seems to get more rewarding with multiple viewings.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A beautiful mess,"This movie is very hard to pinpoint. Like somebody pointed out, the actors are pretty terrible. Or rather, they're a good bunch of actors but they don't do very well. Then we have Mr. Coppola who don't really seem to know what to do with his script. Parts of the movie are scary, parts are campy. There's a very erotic undertone that I don't get from the book.The movie starts out pretty strong, then gets lost for a good deal of time. When Van Helsing arrives, it regains some of its momentum. The ending was pretty strong, although I personally did not like the actual resolution of the film.Anyway, it was an interesting watch. Time has been surprisingly kind to Dracula. Cinematography, one of Coppola's strong suits, was again phenomenal. He also uses some very interesting techniques that remind us from old b/w classics. Staccato POV shots and obsolete cameras add to the splendid mess that makes this movie a Part of Horror History.That being said, I think that the time is ripe for a remake that is more aligned with Stoker's book.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Gets worse on repeat viewings.,"Francis Ford Coppola's take on the Dracula legend sees Gary Oldman as the Count, who as a warrior prince returns from battle to find his true love, who after believing him to have been killed, has committed suicide. Renouncing his Christianity he pledges to return from the death to enact revenge on humanity. Century's later he is back to keep his word but becomes infatuated with Mina (Winona Ryder) who bears a resemblance to his long dead true love.Forget the Bram Stoker bit, this is liberty taken wholesale, and forget any notion of this being a scary Dracula movie, for this is Gothic romance opulence. There is no doubting that as a production design goes, it's top dollar, costumes, photography, score, sets and puppetry etc, all the money is up there on the screen to please the eyes and the ears. But the narrative shift to make Dracula a tragic longing figure is a mistake, as is several casting decisions and performances. It's actually easier to say who comes out of it with credit, so step up Tom Waits as Renfield and Richard E. Grant as Dr. John Seward. Oldman is committed to the lead role, and has tortured soul down pat, but someone thought it was a good idea to make him an old ponce and stick a set of buttocks on his head! You just can't take the character seriously from the moment he appears on screen.There's some vampire erotica as Coppola caters for the horny horror faithful, though these scenes play out like an after midnight MTV video, so not really very sexy at all. While there's a lot of fun to be had, yes you read right, with a number of scenes inserted within the dull narrative: did the great Anthony Hopkins just sniff the cheese and Keanu Reeves attempt a posh British accent? Aaargh! It should have been a Gothic classic, but clearly Coppola was out of his depth tackling such a genre. After giving myself over ten years between returning to watch the film again, I can say with confidence that it's a film that gets worse on repeat viewings. That is unless you like unintentional comedy pictures? 3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Memorable, grandiose and seductive, Bram Stroke's Dracula delivers a timeless classic that brings new life to one of the most beloved tales of all","Based on the novel written in 1897, Bram Stoker's Dracula is, for many, the definitive film version of the character. No wonder the feature film directed by Francis Ford Coppola (The Godfather) won three Oscars (Best Makeup, Best Costume and Best Sound Editing) and is still marked in the memory of everyone who watched it. A weighty work, which courageously assumes its choices, delivering what is expected of it and much more, not conforming to the obvious and investing in creativity by reinventing a timeless tale, but more modern than ever.Coppola, who in the 90s had absolutely nothing left to prove as a director, decided to challenge himself, refusing any use of effects other than camera effects, that is, basically reverting to the Cinema of the beginning of the 20th century, in a certain way. Way bringing his work closer to the technology of the time when the source material was written (1897), in the early days of the Seventh Art.Although the title bears the name of the original author - a practice by Coppola himself, which refers to his previous desire to baptize his greatest work as The Godfather by Mario Puzo, that is, respecting literary authorship - and seeks to be, in fact, faithful to the book on which it is based for the most part, Bram Stoker's Dracula presents one big difference: it is, ultimately, a touching love story, rather than just a horror tale (albeit still that is, of course). Dracula is a crusader nobleman who, shortly after leaving for battle, is presumed dead. This causes his fianc√©e to commit suicide in grief. He, however, returns, and when he finds out what happened he goes crazy, murdering everyone around him. A curse, at this point, falls on him, condemning him to eternity in search of lost love. Which will only be found centuries later, when, upon receiving a realtor in his castle in Romania, he identifies in his bride the perfect image of the woman he loved so much long ago.When making The Heart of the Heart (1981), a film that ended up costing about ten times its original budget, Francis Ford Coppola went bankrupt, having to get involved with several projects in a row just to pay off his debts. One such feature was The Godfather 3 (1990), a sequel that he had sworn he would never do, but ended up being convinced otherwise. One of the actresses cast in this film was Winona Ryder, who, however, dropped out at the last minute, creating a big problem for the director. Trying to apologize to him, she presented him with another proposal, one that would star as the protagonist: Dracula! It was from this invitation that he got involved with directing, as it was also a story he had long wanted to bring to the screen. And even though his filming was not the smoothest, and he refused to treat this work as his own (""I was a hired director, to make a ready-made script, based on the initiative of an actress"", he later said), it is possible to perceive the filmmaker's genius in every scene. This was arguably the last of his great films.The vampire myth has always proved to be powerful and seductive, whether through literary works or its countless film versions, but none proved to be more grandiose than Bram Stoker's book. Dracula has become a respected and referenced symbol, bringing the ultimate horror and revolutionizing the way of telling a story, but the big question that remains is: how to bring this book back to life? First of all, it must be said that Bram Stoker's Dracula is not just a horror movie. The film directed by Francis Ford Coppola is, above all, a powerful and seductive love story. It may seem strange at first, but when brought together in the director's vision, it proves to be something sublime and ravishing. Hart's script is accurate in the way he narrates the story and Coppola's direction shows precision in what to focus on, preferring to work the presence of Oldman as Dracula as the center of attention, a decision more than right. The practical prosthetic work that transforms the actor into an elderly vampire hundreds of years old, then rejuvenates him while converting him into a werewolf are excellent, as is the whole gothic atmosphere that Thomas E. Sanders' production design (in his first work), art direction by Andrew Precht (responsible for Hook, Return of Captain Hook, his first feature, the year before) and photography by veteran Michael Ballhaus (Goodfellas) manage so masterfully to evoke.Overall, it lacks terror and plenty of romance: it's a beautiful love story, in fact, a typical romantic opera full of intrigue and mystery. Despite love, terror and sex are also present, giving the film memorable and very sensual scenes, such as the one where Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reevers) leaves his room at night to see the castle (and also to understand what was happening in that godforsaken place) and meets three vampires, Dracula's insatiable brides, who ""taste"" him! The film features other notable scenes: the aforementioned introduction showing Prince Vlad fighting the Turks (such a fight was performed as if it were a shadow theater, a common spectacle in the 19th century) and his revolt against God for the death of Elisabetha (which would be reincarnated in Mina, 400 years later); the ship carrying the Count (with the crew being phased out); the sweet kiss of friends Lucy and Mina (lesbian sexiness always works in movies of the last two decades) under Dracula's lecherous gaze in the sky, flipping across the deck of the ship he is ""driving"", stoking the storm that surrounded them; the wolf taken over by Dracula himself possessing Lucy (played by delightful English actress Sadie Frost), under Mina's petrified gaze of terror; the vampirization, slow and gradual, of Lucy, until she becomes a vampire (two sublime moments in this vampirization: the wolf entering Lucy's room while Mina and Jonathan are married; and the vampire Lucy taking a child to the coffin to satiate your bloodlust); Dracula seducing Mina into bed, with her sucking his open wound and wanting to be his of her own accord, and shortly after, he cornered, turning into rats before his hunters; the three vampires trying to drive Dr. Van Helsing mad in the castle, while he sought to protect the near-vampire Mina; and the final scene (which absolutely does not exist in Stoker's book), where Dracula obtains God's forgiveness in the face of Mina's love.Coppola's self-imposed challenge to only use old techniques for special effects, as admirable and brave as it may be, turns out to be a trap. And the trap is not in its use, but in the exaggeration and Bram Stoker's Dracula is a kind of glossary of optical special effects. We have frame rate acceleration, rear-projection, double exposure, iris closure, matte paintings, forced perspective and countless other classic techniques. With his son Roman Coppola at his side as second unit director, Francis made his Bram Stoker's Dracula an ode to the origins of cinema. The inspirations and tributes are many, from the obvious Cocteau and his Beauty and the Beast (1946) to The Shining (1980, by Kubrick. His version - among the many already made from this character - is almost as if it were the first, if the book had been released a short time before. Filmed entirely in the studio, all its effects were conceived and executed as in the time of Georges M√©li√®s, one of the pioneers of the seventh art. The presence of shadows is used a lot - and with intelligence and the impact they cause, in addition to other equally basic artifices, such as mirrors and miniatures. The result is astonishingly current, even more than twenty years after its launch, and fits with style within the assumed proposal.The romance between the two protagonists - Dracula, played to perfection by Gary Oldman (in all its versions, giving a show of the makeup department that was, deservedly, awarded at the Oscars, as well as the impressive costumes by Eiko Ishioka and the competent effects sounds), and Winona Ryder's Mine - occupies much of the story, but not all of it. There are other dramas in parallel, such as the fate of the girl's fianc√© (Keanu Reeves, in apathetic participation), the vampire hunter (Anthony Hopkins, a tone above necessary) and the girl's best friend, Lucy (Sadie Frost), who becomes the bloodthirsty lover's first victim, motivating her three suitors (Cary Elwes, Billy Campbell and Richard E. Grant) to try to save her at all costs. These parallel events motivate the unfolding of the action, while helping to involve the spectator in this atmosphere of mystery and seduction, employing a moderate eroticism and many scares, taken advantage of in the right measure. Bram Stoker's Dracula is exactly what you'd expect: sexy and terrifying.Coppola seems to understand that his source material is absurd in many ways, and he handles it brilliantly by embracing the over-the-top nature of his narrative, and finally getting to the completely operatic tone that the film ends up having. The film marries very well with every point of its original material and is elevated mainly by Coppola's dexterity and mastery of its technical aspects. Bram Stoker's Dracula is brilliantly beautiful in every aspect, particularly in his visual effects and his makeup, and he manages to portray the most ""absurd"" moments of his narrative with exact amusement in his ""visual inventions"".Memorable, grandiose and seductive, Bram Stroke's Dracula delivers a timeless classic that brings new life to one of the most beloved tales of all. Investing in creativity, the feature masterfully recounts one of the greatest works ever made, perpetuating its curse for generations and begging even more the dark desires of its protagonist in our hearts. Francis Ford Coppola's Bram Stoker's Dracula is the undisputed and ultimate adaptation of The Dark Lord, and Coppola's vision of Stoker's story remains one of the best vampire films ever made.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Gothic Tapestry of Love and Horror,"Francis Ford Coppola's ""Dracula"" is a visually opulent and ambitious adaptation of Bram Stoker's classic tale. The film, released in 1992, showcases a captivating blend of gothic horror and romance, featuring stellar performances, meticulous direction, and striking cinematography.Adapting Stoker's iconic story, Coppola injects fresh life into the narrative while remaining faithful to its core. The film weaves in elements of historical fiction, delving into the tragic backstory of the titular character, Count Dracula. This adds a layer of depth and empathy to the vampire, played brilliantly by Gary Oldman, whose performance seamlessly transitions between the seductive and the monstrous.The ensemble cast, including Keanu Reeves, Winona Ryder, and Anthony Hopkins, delivers strong performances that complement the film's atmospheric tone. While Reeves received some criticism for his accent, the overall chemistry and commitment of the cast contribute to the movie's engaging storytelling.Coppola's direction is a standout aspect of the film. The use of practical effects, elaborate sets, and innovative techniques pays homage to classic horror cinema. The decision to employ practical effects over excessive CGI, particularly in Dracula's transformations, enhances the film's authenticity and showcases Coppola's dedication to the craft.Cinematographer Michael Ballhaus creates a visual feast, employing lush colors and shadow play to evoke a sense of both dread and allure. The film's visual style is complemented by Wojciech Kilar's haunting score, adding another layer to the immersive experience.However, the film isn't without its critiques. Some argue that the pacing falters at times, and the narrative's departure from the source material may not resonate with purists. Additionally, while the film's romantic angle is poignant, it may overshadow the horror elements for viewers seeking a more traditional vampire tale.In conclusion, Coppola's ""Dracula"" stands as a unique and visually stunning interpretation of Stoker's classic. With its strong performances, masterful direction, and captivating cinematography, the film successfully blends horror and romance, offering a memorable cinematic experience despite its departure from the traditional Dracula narrative. Whether one appreciates it for its artistic vision or critiques it for deviations, ""Dracula"" remains a noteworthy entry in the realm of gothic cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Makes Tim Burton Look Like Aki Kaurismaki,"Francis Ford Coppola's madly elaborate Dracula rendition is set between London at the advent of a modern-ish age and Transylvania according to an explosion at the Batman: The Animated Series factory. We meet a young attorney named Jonathan Harker who is supposed to venture to Dracula's castle to arrange some kind of real estate whatever stuff. The last guy who went there ran into some snags. No big deal, though. He goes, and there begins a series of deafening and flagrant omens, none of which seem to deter or even catch the attention of young Harker en route.It seems as though every stop is being pulled out on Jonathan Harker's journey to let him know that danger is near. Many find the casting of Keanu Reeves in the role laughably wrong-headed, but if you think about it, he's the only one with a blank and vapid enough stare to be believable as someone who manages to miss the most aggressively blatant signs of suspicion.Meanwhile, Sir Anthony Hopkins plays Professor Van Helsing as a guy who may not be able to save victims of wolf rape, but sure can explain the hell out of it. Now, there is a lot that transpires between the voyage to Salvador Dali's Looney Tunes night terror and the werewolf violation, but Coppola and his creative team show every brazen sign of being far more interested in parades of extravagance and ceremonious tableau than with narrative power. The movie is extraordinarily theatrical in how it favors intensification over flow.The lavish use of expressionism reaches to such heights that it ends up eliciting unwanted laughter. Every set, every backdrop, every detail, foreshadowing, subtext, atmospheric flourish and mere shadow on the wall is screamed at us. It makes Tim Burton look like a Scandinavian minimalist. But all the same, it can be fun letting yourself get swept up in the energy and exhilaration of the whole go-for-broke enterprise.It does, after all, salvage the title character from the creative flatness of most of his other movie interpretations, and then some. I'd argue that Werner Herzog's Nosferatu takes the cake as the more deeply affecting choice, but I mean, it didn't have wolf rape or baby-eating nymphomaniacs or Tom Waits as an insane guy. Or wolf rape. And Gary Oldman is here. And Sir Anthony Hopkins. They've never detracted from the quality of any movies either have been in as far as I can tell. But more to the point, as the movie sees it, there is a reason why the three Oscars it happened to win were for makeup, costume design and sound editing. It was also nominated for one more, and that was art direction. By now, you surely see the common thread: As a sensory experience, it's a gasser.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
I shall rise from my own death...,"What a powerful line. What an extraordinary movie. I remember seeing Dracula back in 1992 and was blown away ever since. It's one of a kind with the perfect recipe of both, being tragic and human as well as terrifying and shocking. Alone the 1st 5 minutes are probably the most intense intro I've ever seen. Mr. Gary Oldman just outperformed himself and leaves a true cinematic legacy. No wonder Bram Stokers Dracula received (quite unusual for a horror movie) several academy awards.

"Lives up to the Original Well, Accept a Few Problems","Bram Stoker's Dracula from 1992, a remake of the original from 1931 wasn't a bad remake and ended up been quite faithful to what I liked about the original. Before I get on with the review I will say this: I have never been a massive fan of any Dracula films but I do like the original and this film for what they were. I also think that even if this remake was a nice blend and touch to the original, it was still not what I had expected. The other thing I'll say is that I didn't have many problems, and I did like this version from 1992.Dracula 1992 basically follows along the same lines as the original plot. A man is near getting married but he is called on to go to Transivania and he meets an unknown fiend named Coutn Dracula who loves blood. When Dracula gets to this man, he pursues in going to London and wishing his soon be wife away with him. A lot of trouble brews throughout England as people get hurt, Dracula gets a new look and a vampire killer/slayer named Van Helsing is on the catch to get him.The story is all round the same but there are two major differences that I found with this film: The overall atmosphere and feel of this film was really different. They took it to a whole new level as they got well known actors (being Gary Oldman playing Dracula and Anythony Hopkins as the Vampire Slayer), the music was full of dread, costumes and make up was also quite up to date style and the film followed the lines of Gothic and old times (obviously as this film is set in the 18th century). The remake (like the Halloween Remake) was much more longer than the original film itself giving us more detail, back story, and a lot of story.Gary Oldman was an excellent choice as Dracula. He made this role really creepy, dreadful, loving, romantic-like, soothing but also Gothic. I also loved how they kept the contents of how the vampire(s) must be killed and I liked in general what they did with Dracula's character here. They gave him a lot to do in this film e.g. (his over shadow moving in a direction that he wasn't, the way he can change from a cold blooded creature into a handsome young devil. Anthony Hopkins also did a top notch job on his role and he really bumped the film to it's peak. The other actors were good as well.The film does suffer with a few problems. They give us a lot of scenes of things happening to people and then the scenes has a black out and we end up seeing that the person is alive or un hurt. I don't know what the director was trying to achieve with some of those weird scenes that I did not understand. It was a little hard to understand what he was trying to get at. But most of the time I got what he was trying to do. It was just the little scenes that I think could have been better.Overall this remake is quite a faithful remake to the original. If you have seen the original 1931 film but not this. Watch this with an open mind as it is a really good remake. Not the best and it wouldn't rank up with other modern horror remakes such as Dawn of the Dead but it's still good. I just found that it was a totally different film, but worked on it's own well.Not as good as the 1931 version but I still like it and give it the same score as the 1931 film. 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not a classic, but great version all the same.","Being a poor teenager of 16 in 1993, and before i got my first job a year later, i went into town for in the bargain bins for cheap VHS films, however my luck came in that day as they marked up Bram Stoker's Dracula at ¬£2.99 instead of ¬£12.99, and so i happily trotted back home with a new release film to watch at a budget price!Not knowing really what to expect i was thrown into this fantasy horror world of the kind i had never experienced before.One thing i was aware of though was Keanu Reeves really bad English accent attempt, sure it wasn't as bad as Dick Van Dykes in Mary Poppins, but it was distracting (more cringey) all the same!The film itself is fairly slow paced at times, but has a good mixture of love story, action and horror with first-class acting all-round bar the previously mentioned!Whilst it doesn't pull on any heart strings emotionally its a great interpretation of the classic novel.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A little flawed,"Everybody knows the tale of Dracula, or at least, have a vague understanding of the mythos. For those that need a little reminder the story is rather simple. Jonathan Harker travels from London to the Carpathian Mountains, on the border to Transylvania. There he meets Count Dracula and acts as his solicitor. Dracula then moves to London and all manner of strange things occur.Francis Ford Coppola's version strays little from this vague introduction that I have afforded, but that, I am afraid, is where the similarity ends. The characters names remain the same but the actions they carry out are completely alien to the source material. For example the love story between Mina Harker and Dracula is a completely new angle on the tale. Throughout the movie many of these changes occur. It is so far removed from the original that you may even question if the writers ever read it! If you have read the book then you may take offense to Coppola's interpretation. The only way I managed to enjoy it, having read the book, is forcing myself to believe it is not part of the same story ark.The saving grace of this film is undoubtedly Gary Oldman. It takes an acting pro to hold a film on his own, thankfully Oldman is just that. Upon watching his performance it is hard to imagine anyone else in the role. It is unequivocally the role he was born to play! It is unfortunate that an actor is the saving grace of a film but that is often the way. I will not even begin to discuss Keanu Reeves' acting in this, let's just say it wasn't that good, (little surprise there then).In all this film would be more aptly named ""Coppola's Dracula,"" at least the fans of the book would be appeased. There is something to be said for the special effects on the film, as they are quite groundbreaking. I would suggest checking out the special features to see how they were done as it is intriguing, to say the least. All I can say is watch the film, it is an excellent portrayal by Oldman I am sure you will agree, but the film is ""A little flawed.""",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

A classic subject into a movie to enjoy,I enjoyed watching horror movie and I believe the movie Dracula from Bram Stoker is an excellent underated movie. Gary Oldman is absolutely astonishing in the main role as Dracula the vampire. This legend is explained and supported with some historical facts from Eastern Europe that might be true as Count Vlad Dracul (Dracula) has existed and lived in Romania. He was a powerful prince and warrior and fought against the soldiers from the Ottoman Empire marching to Western Europe. Unfortunately he was betrayed and became furious as he was looking for vengeance. He then became the beast we know today with a thirst for blood.,10.0,Anonymous,Horror
It could have been fantastic.,"The all-star cast featuring a string of famous names, with such a well-known director, should have been fantastic. However, in many cases, it just comes across as laughable.The acting is not good, mainly due to the fact that no-one is speaking with their real accent. If that isn't the problem, it's due to the fact that the poor script requires the actor to writhe around in agony.The camera work seems to be done by someone who has just got new equipment and is trying it all out to see how many cheesy transitions and different overlaps they can do.I was certainly impressed by the costumes and the set design. One exception, check out Dracula's hair sculpted into a bum (not a typo!) when he turns away from camera. The make-up and fake blood definitely need work, though. I have a theory that they used cherryade.It's interesting how the film sticks to the *real* theme of the book -- Victorian repression. This is typically shown within the film as nude vamps and the portrayal of Mina and Lucy as sex-crazed women. I'm glad that it was thought necessary to expand their personalities for this film, but this was not the way to do it. However, as far as I'm concerned, this is not *Bram Stoker's* Dracula. Dracula is portrayed sympathetically and there is a whole new plot thread involving him and Mina. Also, he is given more of an origin.What they could have done was to admit that the film is about Mina and Dracula's love and therefore not faithful to the book at all. Take out the title reference to the writer and redo it so the love story is completely central.On a positive note, the song over the end credits is beautiful. Haunting, evocative - exactly what this film should have been. That's not to say I didn't find the film enjoyable, just not for the right reasons.",,Anonymous,Horror
overrated,"This version has several moments of cinematic wit and occasional visual brilliance but it's mostly hokey, pokey and thoroughly overblown. Gary Oldman is much the best actor in an uneven crew with several of the supporting players making NO impression whatsoever (like vampires I guess). The effect is like having cardboard cut-outs standing around in place of characters. Anthony Hopkins doesn't even bother to use his Dutch accent in several scenes but reverts to his best ""Remains of the Day"" Brit voice. The plot meanders and the sheer lavishness of the sets, costumes and cinematography seriously thwarts the somber/horrible mood of the movie over and over. I finally turned off the color on my TV to see if I could get into it a little more. It didn't help enough to make me feel any better about it. I'm mystified that this movie enjoys such a great popular reputation. This movie must have cost a fortune yet doesn't hold a candle to the cheapie black and white Spanish language version of Universal's ""Dracula"" shot after hours on the sets being used for the Bela Lugosi version.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Awesome!,"Although I may be a tad bit biased in my review (because this is my favorite movie) this is an awesome Dracula love story. No, I have not read the book therefore I have nothing to compare it to but unlike most Dracula films Bram Stoker makes you feel compassionate towards Drucula (who more often than not depicted as a villain)with his pursuit for love. The cast selection was great! Anthony Hopkins was a fitting selection for the famous Van Helsing and of course Winona Rider playing Dracula's long lost love was just superb!The way it ended was just gruesomely romantic (which is where i I think true blood got its idea of the ending of Bill and Sookie from the final season, but that just my opinion..) I can watch this movie every time it comes on TV and I still watch it as if it was my first time.#TeamDracula",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Glossy, but Empty","This is a very glossy, special effects-laden film, with no heart or soul, and very superficial acting, which reminds me of an elaborate video game. This is to literature, what ""300"" is to history. There are no characters to sympathize with, ironically with the exception of Dracula himself. The novel has been thus completely inverted. It is definitely NOT ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"". It conforms to the modern formula of style and effects over characters and story. Emptiness. To see the closest adaptation, to the novel, which I have seen, watch the 1977 BBC production, entitled ""Count Dracula"" on You Tube. It's not perfect, but at least it adheres to the original story, and has people, with whom one can identify. Coppola's production has an ever-changing sumptuous visual circus, which tries to distract you from the fact, that it is emotionally empty, but it doesn't succeed.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Bram Stoker spinning wildly in his grave!,"It is called ""Bram Stoker's Dracula."" The title is deceiving.This film is an incoherent mess, to put it rather bluntly.The effects, which look beautiful, only take away from the story-- you forget that this is a vampire movie and you are left with an impression that it is a special effects promo. And for crying out loud, what is with that tagline ""Love Never Dies?"" This film has taken a classic story and mutated it into a romance. Granted, there were huge romantic elements in the original Dracula-- the gothic horror classics such as it and Frankenstein flowed elegantly like poetry, and romance was used. But this film has taken something that Bram Stoker never intended and made it the key focus: Mina is now a riencarnation of a lover who Dracula lost while still Vlad the Impaler, and the whole film is basically an endless trek as they find each other and rediscover their lost love. OOOOKAY!As far as events in the book goes, it is pretty accurate, but that's not the point. The point is, they completely changed the focus on some kind of unnesseccary love story. If Coppola had made the film an accurate account of the legend, it would have worked great. If he had changed the title from ""Bram Stoker's"", I might have liked it a little better (Even though the endless effects, as I have mentioned, made it mind-numbing and incoherent). Instead, it is only boring, tedious, and an insult to everything Bram Stoker hoped to accomplish. Poor Mr. Stoker....If he knew such trash like this would come out of his work, I'm sure he would have never written it.If you want to see a good Dracula film, watch the Klause Kinski version of Nosferatu. It certainly isn't faithful to the novel, but at least it doesn't PRETEND to be,  like this sorry excuse for a Dracula epic does.I would give this film a negative two hundred on a scale of one to ten, if not for Anthony Hopkin's brilliant performance as Van Helsing.

Coppola is a bloodletting haberdasher--like a practical joker at a funeral,"Bram Stoker's tale of Dracula was never like this: an 1890s realtor is kept prisoner in the Count's castle while the vampire covets and stalks his fianc√©e (who is perhaps the reincarnation of a lost love) and her best friend (who proves to be just a snack). Anthony Hopkins is a half-cocked Van Helsing, Gary Oldman is the Vampyr as a Punk Rocker. Outre theatrics, imaginative camera-tricks courtesy director Francis Ford Coppola, but this is hardly a landmark retelling. Plenty of visual foreplay, but what the film lacks is a narrative that makes sense to us and doesn't shut us out. Coppola has become a rock-video auteur--not necessarily a bad thing--yet there's only a trace of music here, while the majority of the assembled talent is smothered by a conceptual design which knows no boundaries. Eventually, the whole thing is irrelevant. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
For the dead travel fast,"Not too many movies try to stick close to the story or at least the essence of what the story is about. You get a lot of bloodsuckers without the true story as seen from the time. This presentation kept all the main characters and kept them as they were meant to be. Many of the actual lines from the original story are presented here.The basic story is of Dracula losing his love only to find her again four centuries later. Well, not quite the original thrust of the story it fits well as the main thread. Drac goes to London to start a new life and finds food for thought. Munching on Sadie Frost can defrost anyone's soul. And Winona Ryder makes a tasty Mina. Keanu Reeves picks up a British accent.Two major drawbacks, keeping this from being a five-star movie is that many of the visual effects are hokey and threaten to undo the pathos of the story. And what is with the dumb-looking Renfield outfits? Secondly, the background music turns out to be foreground music and the actor lines get lost in the noise.Of course, the ending does not match the book but it works for the story being told.---------------------------------------------------------------------
Just a note that if you are buying this for Blu-ray you are missing the point of the movie. Yes the blood is bloodier and you can see the good bumps on naked flesh, but it doe not change the story one iota. I only bought a Blu-ray beau that is the technology of the time.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
This film is far too melodramatic to be effective...,"This film is far too melodramatic to be effective, especially compared with its predecessors, ""Nosferatu"" and Bela Lugosi's version of the tale. The cut scenes jump rapidly, the camera work plays like an unfunny friend telling jokes and the acting, save for Dracula and Van Helsing, is horrible. Keanu Reeves is laughable in his role as Hutter, even given the need for an ""innocent"" and naive character, while the rest of the characters are lackluster and corny at best.There are a few saving graces, to be sure. Gary Oldman is stellar as Dracula. Also, the love scene with Keanu and the 3 wives of Dracula is very erotic (especially if your preference is women... or BDSM.) Lastly, Tom Waits makes a pretty good Renfield - even if he, too, is a bit melodramatic in the role.

"Keanu ""Doing"" An English Accent Is Simply Hilarious","Don't get me wrong this film will appeal to a lot of people, compared to other vampire films this is definitely up there, but that's like winning first prize at an ugly contest. What is great about this film is the drama and theater style applied from the director and set designers. However the cast choice is simply wrong, Keanu is a great actor, but not capable of an English accent. At this early stage in his career all I see when I watch this movie is Bill and Ted coming through in his voice and mannerisms. I end up laughing at him dealing with an English accent which doesn't really help put the fear of Dracula into me. Its a great film but for me it borders on being a comedy due to this. Many I am sure will completely disagree. If you want a classic refined British accent hire an actor from classic British decent, instead of stoner Ted Theodor Logan :)",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dracula: a 9.6 but not a 10++.,"-------Dracula.-------A 9.6 but not a 10++.I am giving ten well deserved stars to this version of Dracula as it is without any doubt the best adaptation of the Abraham (Bram) Stoker¬¥s book to the big screen. Nonetheless, it¬¥s a 9.5 or 9.6 star movie that become ten when you round and not a 10+ or 10++ because if this movie has any defect at all is that in the moments when Dracula does not appear, the tension falls dramatically, which is also applicable to some moments when Dracula appears in his human form during daytime; and it is actually a defect that it maybe shares with the book it came from. Nevertheless, I think that this wasn¬¥t necessarily a defect 100 and something years ago when Stoker wrote his novel, as life was slower in those days and there was no TV, movies or internet. Actually if you ever read the first chapter of the original Bram Stoker¬¥s Dracula, you will be amazed how in some few pages, the author teaches you a little bit of many things at the same time that he tells you the first part of the story. He teaches you a little bit of gastronomy, a little bit of geography, a little bit of mythology and even a little bit of German and other languages. Nonetheless, when the story advances you keep wanting less details and more action.Thanks for reading.IMDb Review written by David del Real.2018.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
messy but interesting,"Fresh off the critical failure of The Godfather Part 3, Francis Ford Coppola set out to retrieve his reputation with this adaptation of Bram Stoker'¬Ä¬ôs novel Dracula. He assembled a starry cast; Gary Oldman, Winona Ryder (who had famously dropped out of the Godfather Part 3 due to exhaustion, leading to the Sofia Coppola debacle), hot young thing Keanu Reeves, and Anthony Hopkins, fresh from his Oscar success. So where did it all go wrong? Well, tonally and thematically the film is a mess. It feels like various different movies spliced together. It looks beautiful though. Coppola and cinematographer Michael Ballhaus creating a stunning look, draped in Gothic beauty, and Coppola seemingly knows his film history, borrowing liberally from vampire films of the past, particularly Nosferatu. The acting is a mixed bag. Keanu Reeves is uncomfortably out of his depth, struggling constantly with an English accent, while Anthony Hopkins hams it up as Van Helsing. The bright spark though is Gary Oldman, completely immersing himself in the role, even when buried under prosthetics and wigs. He makes Dracula a horrific character, while also finding added layers of pathos and sadness. It'¬Ä¬ôs a shame the film is such a mess though.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the worst movies I've ever seen,"I was excited when I saw the previews for ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"".  It was expressly marketed as the first movie to tell the story the way Bram Stoker wrote it.Nothing could be further from the truth.Calling it ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" is an insult to the author of this classic tale.  It's not just that it doesn't compare to the book.  That rarely happens with any screen adaptation of a great novel.  However, Coppola completely changed massive amounts of important aspects of the story.  I find it amusing that after going on and on about how it was going to adhere so strictly to the original story, they had to release a new novel of Coppola's version so people would ""get it"".Most of the acting is terrible throughout.  The nature of characters are completely different from Stoker's (most notably Van Helsing, Mina, and Lucy).  The love story added in is lame (at one point reminiscent of a Monty Python skit), and some of the ""imagery"" is cheesy.  There were some decent effects, though, which made about 1% of the movie interesting.  Some of the costumes aren't bad, others aren't good.After seeing an interview with Coppola, one really gets the sense that he believes this is the way the story ""should have"" or ""would have"" been told had Stoker been allowed to write openly about certain topics.  That is, however, utter nonsense and arrogance.Coppola has made some astounding films, but this ain't one of them.  It's amongst the worst movies I've ever seen.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The Sad, Romantic, Dark life of The legendary Dracula","Bram stoker's Dracula has left me with a motivation to pursue my dream of working in film. The film has unforgettable scenes and moments. The music flows with it immensely. The highlight of the film would have to be Gary Oldman's performance of the seductive, manipulative, romantic, dark, prince that longs for Mina and fill the emotional void of his lost love. The filming and score are superb. However In my opinion some of the gross sexual parts of the film could have very well not been put in as it subtracts from the beauty and quality of the story. Leaving you with a B grade horror movie feeling. Winona Ryder was wonderful as always with her performance as the innocent, modest, Beautiful, Mina. All other performances done well. But do not miss this classic monster movie that goes above and beyond in the telling of the epic life and story that goes into a character study of the man Prince Vlad. Dracula,",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Probably my favorite Dracula movie,"Being someone who reads (or read) a lot, I feel bad about not having read the original Dracula novel. It makes it hard for me to determine whether or not certain films are direct retellings of the original or completely new stories. As I've seen the famous Bela Lugosi version, this seemed to follow the same plot as that one. Of course, when you have something as big as Dracula, you can't help but know a bit of the story. This is most likely the best Dracula movie I've ever seen. I remember how the hairdo was parodied in a ""Treehouse Of Horror"" episode of ""The Simpsons"". It's a shame that just disappears thirty-six minutes into the movie.I had no idea Anthony Hopkins was in this movie and boy, does he do an amazing job! I loved him as Van Helsing and appreciated how all of these characters had such unique personalities. I didn't even recognize Keanu Reeves! It's great to have so many beloved actors in a movie. I was surprised at how sexual and bloody this film was. It really does seem like a whole new take on Dracula. The first five minutes are the best as it actually explains his origin. It's a short scene, but dang, is it poetic. I thought this would be longer, but I think the length was perfect. I just love the atmosphere, the bright colors, the costumes, it's a wonderful film. ***1/2",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
The best of all Dracula films,"Bram Stoker's novel has inspired many adaptations over the years, and F.W.Murnau, Tod Browning ,Terence Fisher and Werner Herzog all made especially fine versions {and even the 1979 John Badham version was pretty good}. However, this superb film tops them all, with Francis Ford Coppola really pulling out the stops to create a wonderfully stylized work which seems to reference it's fore bearers while topping them for horror, eroticism and sheer cinematic skill.Despite what some have said this IS the closest cinematic version to the book. Amazing scenes from the novel which have either been absent from previous versions or not done to their full potential are present here, such as Dracula climbing down the wall of his castle, or Dracula giving a baby to his brides to feed on so they spare Harker. A great many other scenes are heightened, for instance the werewolf ravaging Lucy. This was only vaguely suggested in the book, so Coppola and his writer James V. Hart do what every good adapter should do and develop and expand the idea to suit their purpose while still being faithful to the feel and intention of the original. Another example of this approach is the extremely erotic sequence with Harker and Dracula's brides.Of course the 'eternal love' subplot, which seems partially borrowed from some versions of The Mummy, was not in the book at all and does make Dracula a little bit sympathetic, but kudos to the filmmakers for having an emotionally complex Dracula who is not just a bogeyman.More importantly, Bram Stoker's Dracula is just so stunningly CINEMATIC. From the costumes to the sets to the cinematography, it is amazing to look at, while Coppola uses almost every possibly cinematic tool at his disposal to enrich his story. He crosscuts feverishly during some sequences, achieving an operatic grandeur while on other occasions he is more subtle, such as the opening battle, done brilliantly in silhouette. No shot is uninteresting, and one thinks of Coppola constantly trying to find the most interesting way to show something. Wolliech Kilar's score is extraordinary, often building levels of sound to striking effect while still delivering a poignant love theme.Some of the acting is a bit hammy, but that was probably the best way to compete with everything else in the picture. Maybe Christopher Lee and Bel Lugosi were scarier than Gary Oldman, but his performance and characteriation of Dracula is more varied. Anthony Hopkins is simply just having fun as Van Helsing ,while Keanu Reeves, well, as with most things this actor does his performance is often criticised, but he doesn't even TRY to compete with Oldman and Hopkins, and that's just fine, Harker should not be that interesting anyway.This is a stunning piece of cinema, and it's doubtful there'll ever be a better Dracula movie.",,Anonymous,Horror

Candy for your eyes,"This movie is all about the visuals, makeup and art direction. It is one of the most stunning movie i've ever seen.The story was okay and a bit confusing. Everything goes very fast. I will need to watch it again at some point. I didn't fully understand the character of Winona Ryder that we're seeing centuries ago and in the present. Is it suppose to be 2 different person? She's immortal and she doesn't remember her love story with Dracula? She didn't age all these years and her new husband is aware of that?The cast was incredible. It is definitely an iconic movie to watch during spooky season. If you like theatrical movies filled with blood and sensuality, this movie is for you!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Highly stylized and visually overwhelming version of the Dracula tale,"This Coppola film is a highly stylized version of the Dracula tale. The art direction almost overwhelms the story: the luscious costumes, settings, colors, and score, they're all meant to add to the gothic fairytale feeling, but visually so dominant, that this movie is more like a cinematographic work of art, than a seriously involving tale. The cast seems to recite their dialogues rather than really act, and even in the more dynamic scenes their actions are carefully choreographed. Apart from Winona Ryder's Mina and Gary Oldman's prince Dracula, non of the other characters seem to have a real personality.Gary Oldman is priceless in his portrayal of the decrepit, age-old Dracula, greatly helped by the fantastic make-up. And Winona Ryder is stunningly beautiful, and perfect as the innocent, besieged and at last beguiled Victorian debutante. But Anthony Hopkins as Van Helsing hardly makes an effort in his bloodless (no pun intended!) role, and Keanu Reeves is only in appearance the ideal Jonathan Harker; but everytime he speaks with a badly feigned English accent and moves around like a wooden stick, his part falls flat (although it was fun to see him at one point being sexually assaulted by three voluptuous naked ghostlike women!).All in all, this Coppola version is more of a sensuous and visually overwhelming cinematographic experience than a serious movie, but in that capacity certainly enjoyable.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

An Interesting and tragic take on the Bloody Count,"Bram Stoker's Dracula is an interesting take on the infamous Count from Romania. Dracula has always been perceived as this mysterious, monsteras, blood sucking evil creature. What Stoker and Coppola did in this case was give the character emotion and a tragic love story - a bit similar to Romeo and Juliet if you ask me.I'll start this review with the positive aspects in my opinion: The costume designs, makeup and set decorations are amongst the most impressive I have seen in a nineties film. No wonder the movie won Best costume design and Best makeup at the Academy Awards. These aspects are captivating and feel true to the story's setting and timeline.In terms of what was negative, I had to point out towards two things: the acting and editing:
The Editing of the film felt a bit rough to me, for example, When Professor Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins) comes to the conclusion that the characters are facing a menace. Suddenly there is a cut to Dracula (Gary Oldman) in his grave, having a somewhat stroke. It is these kinds of small moments where the editing is not at its best.The Acting wasn't my favorite part and I felt quite annoyed by it at some times. Don't get me wrong, Gary Oldman is a fantastic actor and his portrayal is suburb. But his acting is the only muscle that carries the movie's weight. The acting in general in really theatrical (which would make sense due to the period the story is placed). But I'm not a fan of theatrical acting (which is why I'm not a fan of Musicals). I should also point out that Keanu Reeves in this movie looks like he just came out from the set of Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.Overall I did enjoy the take on Dracula's story and his tragic love affair with Mina (Winona Ryder). This movie is a good example of how it's possible to humanize a villain, A writing technique that I really appreciate in movies. The more the villain is humanized and shares emotion, the better the viewers will empathize with him.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Van Helsing and his boys,Maybe the best Dracula film apart from Hammer Christopher Lee's! What set this one apart is even though it doesn't stick 100% to Stoker's novel what it does keep and do well is the hunters of the dark Prince. Anthony Hopkins fresh from his triumph as Hannibal Lector is a great Van Helsing. So is his young team-Keanu as Jonathan Harker-knocked for his accent but i think he does well. Then Grant Elwes and Campbell who fill out the great quartet who support the Doc in killing the creatures. Winona Ryder has never been prettier than in this one as the object of Dracula's love.

BEWARE,"That was the original tagline for the movie, until ""Love Never Dies"" replaced it. They should have stuck with the first tagline, because it would have at least given some people fair warning. This movie is as unfaithful as can be.

I'm certain that in the hundreds of reviews of this movie by other users, nearly every unfaithful scene has been dissected ad nauseum, so I will keep it short: if you are looking for a faithful adaptation, this is the last place you'll want to look.

That coffin did after a while look kinda cozy,"The movie had a good start, so much for that. After the first 15minutes I was still glazed with the cinematography and all the amazing practical effects, but after a while the movie slowed down and became boring.The characters did not work. Take Keanu Reeves character as an example. Every sentence from the start of the film was pretty much just dull. We don't connect with him, we don't empathize for him which in the end makes us just don't care for him. In the middle of the movie is still just lived under the intention that he had been forgotten, we didn't see the man on the screen for nearly an hour!From the beginning I had strong intention for this movie to become one of those classics I so often like to rewatch, but I can certainly say that anything more than coming back to this movie for the practical effects would just not be worth the time.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

The best Dracula movie you'll ever see!,"Coppola's ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" is a gothic masterpiece, and despite its liberties, the most faithful to the novel.One of the last big studio films to use practical in-camera effects, this is not your average rehash of the classic Stoker story. Gary Oldman, Sir Anthony Hopkins, and Sadie Frost are all three in top form, especially Oldman, who gives a sympathy and depth to the titular Dracula no one had ever seen before.It's also worth noting that the score by Wojciech Kilar Is my all-time favorite piece of classical music, and my favorite film score. The music alone is breathtaking.The casting, the FX, the editing, the direction, the score, it's so good that I'd give the movie a 10 out of 10 if it weren't for one huge thing, and many of you will know where I'm about to go. The miscasting of both Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder is the only legitimate criticism to offer. Neither can do an English accent worth a damn, Reeves hadn't yet come into his own as an actor across the board, and Ryder is stale at times within certain scenes. But that aside, Oldman, Hopkins, Waits, Frost, Elwes, Grant, Campbell, and the rest of the cast are all phenomenal. At the end of the day I can get past Reeves and Ryder's lackluster performance when I consider just how amazing this movie is beyond that.Whether you're a fan of vampire movies, Dracula in general, gothic Victorian stories, or just want to see this tale told with a love story's worth of a twist, grab your beloved and hold on as you cross oceans of time with Prince Vlad at the helm!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"One of the better, more accurate versions of the tale of Count Dracula","This one features a somewhat original approach to the story of Count Dracula, trying to include a side-story of lost love. It doesn't work very well, in my opinion, it seems quite out of place in the story. The story is taken directly from the original novel, authored by Bram Stoker. This makes it seem very real and quite true to the original story. The plot is almost exactly the same as the original book, and it keeps the interest pretty good, though the movie is a little slow. The acting is very good, good performances by all the actors. This is probably because most of them are big names; Keanu Reeves, Winona Ryder, Gary Oldman and Anthony Hopkins. The special effects are pretty good, even though the film is over a decade old, the effects don't seem dated. The cinematography is also very good, sometimes even fantastic. The film also has a very good atmosphere, very creepy and ominous. I recommend it to anyone who likes the story of Dracula, or anyone who just enjoys watching films dealing with the supernatural. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dracula- what on earth happened to Coppola,"The fuss around Coppola's Dracula will always remain a mystery to me. I have read the book, and even regardless to the fact the book is by no means incomparable to the movie, the movie is simply a bad one. Did anyone pay attention to how badly all those talented actors acted in this film? Hopkins' adaptation to the Van Helsing accent was ridiculous and annoying, Ryder's acting was melodramatic and unconvincing, and Gary Oldman- well he is simply in love with himself. But it's without a doubt that it was in fact Keanu Reeves who kept amazing me. And it's not as if I thought he was great in other films, but in this one it was absurd, and on the verge of parody; the way he looks when he enters Mina's room with his friends to meet the count- his scattered look, compulsive blinking, lack of any emotion what so ever- just gave me the general feeling that Keanu momentarily forgot in which movie he was playing and what was expected from him. Not to mention that hideous fake British accent, and the robotic style Reeves used to convey us he is 'in the character'. As a comedy- yes, this movie was brilliant. As a horror drama- PE-LEEEASE. It is crystal clear Coppola mis-casted and mis-directed this farce. Horror show all right And a tip to those who have the DVD- don't forget to watch the hilarious documentary, with brilliant shots of I-don't-know-what-I'm-doing-here-Reeves (""Dude, there's something soo weird with being bitten in the neck""), I-am-so-in-love-with-myself Oldman, and much much more.

The vampire film for the Goth generation,"Francis Ford Coppola has crafted something visually stunning with his version of Dracula. It has held up beautifully for 20 years now. If you're one of the viewers who left the theater grumbling that the 1979 version with Frank Langella was better, then you're probably not of the target generation for this film.This new take on the classic Dracula story by Bram Stoker is all MTV attitude where the '79 film was something your dad probably listened to back before they invented CDs. There is a wonderful sense of lushness and extravagance to the sets and the costumes. Coppola's eye for dramatic angles and tricks of lighting brings out the magic and the horror of each scene in equal measure.Emotions are conveyed through a theatrical, exaggerated style of acting: weirdly, it works well even though in any other context you'd be cringing at the hamminess of it all. Gary Oldman as Count Dracula chews through the scenery in a brilliant rendition of a tortured soul who is also a merciless killer. Winona Ryder (whom I normally don't count among the serious actors) does the role of Mina justice: proper Victorian maiden, innocent but drawn to the seductive side of darkness. Keanu Reeves' Jonathan Harker is widely criticized as a dull and wooden character, but serves as a good contrast to his rival the Count. And so we have set up an intense love triangle which draws out the tension effectively.The horrific nature of this tale (ancient vampire from Transylvania crosses the Atlantic ocean to begin a reign of terror in 19th Century England)is not neglected by any means. Violence as well as the more subtle psychological thrills and creeps are in abundance here. Coppola's vampires come in many incarnations, but they are all decadent monsters of the night whose top predatory skill are seduction.So then let yourself be seduced! Delicious thrills await you. Plentiful angst pours out of the dialog in torrents. Coppola is the master of dramatic emotionalism for those who enjoy this over-the-top style.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of my favorite horror movies of all time,"Aside from The Outsiders (1983), Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992) is the only other movie in Francis Ford Coppola's filmography that I've watched prior to this binge section. Now that I've rewatched it for this review, I can easily say that this movie is still phenomenal.Positives for Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992):
Once again, this movie is another phenomenal showcase of Francis Ford Coppola's skills as a top-tier filmmaker. The production value, set designs and costumes in this movie look absolutely phenomenal from start to finish. The movie's score is one of the best I've heard in any horror movie I've ever watched. The makeup effects for the vampires and gore in this movie look spectacular. The performances from the cast are all phenomenal particularly Gary Oldman as Count Dracula, Winona Ryder as Mina Harker and Anthony Hopkins as Professor Abraham Van Helsing. Then, you have Keanu Reeves as Jonathan Harker in this movie and this is one of those castings that people constantly say is one of the worst miscastings in any movie, but for me he's actually pretty decent in the movie. Now to be fair, his attempt at doing a British accent is pretty hilarious in this movie. There are also a number of times to where you see Keanu zinnthe background and he looks clueless to what he's supposed to do in this movie. I loved the main romance between Count Dracula and Hina Parker in this movie as it is the heartbeat of this story and it actually makes Dracula feel more human to the auidence even if he is a monster. And finally, I appreciated the fact that Francis Ford Coppola actually made the auidence care and sympathize with Count Dracula and his actions in the movie.Overall, Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992) is an absolute masterpiece from start to finish.

I think that it's more plausible. So the film is a little ""romantic"" if compared to the novel. Apart this fact I  find it perfect.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Dracula epic film, faithful to the brilliant Bram Stoker classic","Coppola's film tackled the original story so well, the book being one of my favourites of all time. Written entirely through the medium of letters and journal entries, it is an intimate tale that is spine chilling in it's intensity. It doesn't rely on gratuitous frighteners, but plays on all our deepest darkest fears, the things that go bump in the night and not being safe anywhere against this kind of threat, and losing our mortal souls.The film captured the feel and nature of the book well. With Gary Oldman in the titular role - a very talented actor - and he played it elegantly and with a lot of style. Winona Ryder played Mina/Elisabeta, his star-crossed lover. I've always admired her and she suited the period nature of this film, and I liked the semblance of innocence in her way of playing her character compared to her worldly friend Lucy Westenra (Sadie Frost). There's a lot that was a little cheesy, and the acting wasn't the best - everyone seemed to play it a little hammy. Much was made of some of the English accents in the film (ie how bad they were) by Reeves and Ryder but I'm afraid I judge the Director for not picking up on them. There's a lot that's a bit silly in the film, and the accents weren't the worst of it. Even the great Hopkins (Helsing) was touched by the silly-stick and played up his role to the nines. In short it certainly wasn't a dry production as he also ramped up the arrogance and insanity of his role too.At the time of release much was also made of the bestiality scene between Dracula in his wolfman form and Lucy in the garden, I have to say she was brave to take on that! It's shocking, a little, the first time you see it but it's really not bad. The famous Renfield (Tom Waits) was cringeworthily gross, as the craven and mad slave of Dracula. Reeves as the long-suffering Jonathan Harker was not at his best in this, but how do you research walking into a client's home to find he's crazy beehive haired vampire? He comes across out of his depth in this, and I don't know why. He's well cast as Harker, though, he suits the period gentility and properness exceedingly well, but perhaps he was playing up his discomfiture about his character's predicament (justified!) - especially finding himself in bed with three blood-smeared wenches!So much of this film was great, though, despite the over-the-top acting, laughable at times, but it works.Very well. This story is frightening, but it's not in the way that typical horror movies are, and the humour helps you manage it, but there is also intense love and seduction in this story; it is mainly a love story after all. The poignant scene where Mina meets Dracula and a wolf escaped from the zoo walks in... lovely. So much deeper than cheap horror.Victorian sensibility had the Vampire at odds with God, his immortal soul lost to salvation. Prior to Stoker vampires were vile loathsome creatures but he made them magical illusory and a seductive beauty who tempted impressionable young ladies into his eternal death. The film gives room for the spiritual morality tale, accurately and with a sense of the hugeness of what it represented; Vlad Dracula turning his back on God as he felt he had been abandoned after losing his love. Finally, the music used in the film was very good - Love Song for a Vampire by Annie Lennox was superb - and the costumes were stunning, particularly the dresses Winona Ryder got to wear. It's a beautiful film, if you see past the dripping yowling toothy wenches and Monica Bellucci stealing babies.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Oldman's Nosferatu is superb in ""Bram Stoker's Dracula""","Francis Ford Coppola's horror spectacular ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" stays very close to the original true account of Vlad ""the Impaler"" with all the blood, sexuality, gore, & carnage but does not leave out the fangs. Of all the Dracula films made over the years this one was missing one key component, that being Gary Oldman. Oldman's portrayal of the Transylvanian count supersedes any other & makes this film edgier, more sensual, & much more interesting to view. Oldman does more than drink blood or morph into a hideous beast; he shows a side of himself rarely seen in that of a lover. Oldman's Dracula is vulnerable, crazed with broken heart, & the consummate tragic figure. I found Oldman's performance to be one of the best if not the best performance of the Count I have ever seen.The story is simple but moves at a good pace. Many, many years earlier, Vlad Dracula is a prince who is deeply in love with his bride, Elisabeta. For pride & protection of his realm, Vlad leads the kingdom's forces against the Turks with success, which also gains him the nickname of Vlad ""the Impaler"". Unbeknownst to Dracula, a Turk spy shot an arrow into the castle with a note attached bringing false news of Vlad's death. Hopelessly distraught, Elisabeta threw herself into the river below to her death. After returning from his successful war campaign, Dracula is stunned to realize what has become of his lovely young bride. The High Priest tells Dracula that Elisabeta is damned forever for committing suicide according to religious belief. Filled with uncontrollable rage, Dracula renounces his faith, curses God, & thrusts his sword into the Holy cross which bleeds in gushes. Dracula drinks the blood & is forever transformed into what we now know as Count Dracula. Meanwhile in Carfax Abbey, England, two young lovers Mina Murphy(Winona Ryder) & Jonathan Harker make plans to marry. Before all plans are to be finalized, Harker must go on a business trip & complete a big transaction for his boss' firm. Young Jonathan Harker(Keanu Reeves) goes to Transylvania to complete a real estate deal made with mysterious Counnt Dracula(Oldman). During an evening supper, Harker mistakenly shows Dracula a photo of his beloved Mina, who eerily looks a lot like Dracula's Elisabeta. The devious Count devises a plan to keep Harker at the castle while traveling to England to seduce an unsuspecting Mina/Elisabeta. The strange Count holds the poor Harker captive in his castle indefinitely. Packed in his native earth aboard a ship, Dracula nightly feeds on crew members until the ship floats into England unmanned. Dracula infects the rats on board & holds the legions at bay to use later to release a plague on the city. Dracula then goes on the prowl for Mina & seduces longtime friend Lucy Westenra, a local wealthy young woman. As time went on, Lucy fell under the curse of Dracula with a form of anemia & strange physical symptoms. Baffled & confused, Dr. Jack Seward tries to cure Lucy to no avail. Dr. Seward, beau Lord Arthur Holmwood, & Quincy P. Morris all scramble to find answers to Lucy's condition. In desperation, Dr. Seward calls upon the expertise of his former medical professor & friend Prof. Abraham Van Helsing who arrives to help cure Lucy. Van Helsing reveals Lucy's condition as vampyrism, the curse of the foul Nosferatu. Lucy's condition worsens & results in death. Meanwhile, Mina meets the seductive Dracula & begins a strange courtship. Mina cannot understand her magnetism to the Count but still will not totally break her love for Harker. Sensing her need to go to Harker, Mina sets sail for Transylvania to find her love. Harker, who escapes Dracula's brides stumbles upon a nunnery in the mountains where he is nursed back to health. Mina reunites with Harker & the two marry. Furious by Mina's betrayal, the Count knows that Harker must be destroyed & that he must release the plague on England to further his ire. In the crypt, Van Helsing, Seward, Holmwood, & Morris discover that Lucy is the undead & must be vanquished. Holmwood sadly drives a stake through his fianc√©'s heart & Van Helsing decapitates her. Mina & Dracula share an intimate moment with Mina accepting the dreaded curse in order to be with him forever. Reluctantly, Dracula condemns Mina to an everlasting life of blood thirst. Van Helsing & the men intrude on the interlude with Dracula escaping. Van Helsing, knowing that Mina is now cursed, gathers the men together & sets off to Transylvania to destroy the evil Count. Dracula, using Mina's thoughts, travels to his homeland as fast as he can before Van Helsing & the others reach him before sunrise. Van Helsing finds Mina only to realize that she is in league with Dracula & must help her fight the thirst swelling within her. Also, Van Helsing must fend off Dracula's brides who are in a trance fueled by their loyalty to their master & their blood lust. Once caught up with Dracula, Van Helsing & the men fight the master vampire to the death. Dracula is mortally wounded & falls into the chapel inside the castle with Mina. The fallen Nosferatu begs the lovely Mina to end his suffering & release her from his curse. Mina grants Dracula's wish & breaks the curse within her.With great costumes, terrific scenery, well done make-up work, & wonderful performances by Oldman, Ryder, & Hopkins, ""Bram Stoker's Dracula will mesmerize & enthrall you.

The Vidiot Reviews...,"Bram Stoker's DraculaAs well as inspiring the character of Dracula, Vlad the Impaler was also the inventor of the scarecrow.But as this horror movie attests, he didn't use straw and old clothes - he used Turks.Disavowing God after the death of his wife (Winona Ryder), Vlad (Gary Oldman) is cursed to walk the Earth for eternity thirsting for human blood.Surfacing in London centuries later under the moniker Count Dracula, Vlad is shocked to encounter Mina Harker (Winona Ryder), a look-alike of his dead wife.However, Mina's fianc√©e (Keanu Reeves), Professor Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins) and others (Cary Elwes) affected by his actions will stop at nothing to separate the Count's head from his shape-shifting body.The most cinematic and sinister depiction of Stoker's protagonist yet, director Francis Ford Coppola infuses the Gothic narrative with striking visuals, elaborate costumes and brazen eroticism.Furthermore, marrying Dracula means no more buying tampons.Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Incoherent, disappointing effort","Dracula clearly had potential to be a great film. Excellent source material, an excellent director and a excellent cast. Which more is needed, right? Unfortunately, nothing works. The adaptation of the classic book to the film is mediocre at best.The story came in pieces, and is absolutely incoherent further first viewing, that is the most important. It improves upon a second viewing, mostly because you can pay attention to other aspects of the film which is impossible to do with the consistent cuts and scenes rising out of nowhere in first viewing.Still, there are totally nonsense scenes (the cemetery scene is a prime example) in the film that are there for whatever reason. The film captures one of the most important aspects in the book, that is the ambient, the erotic and romantic atmosphere contrasting with the horrific monsters and the dark, Gothic tone given by the excellent art direction. The visual effects tough, are outdated and horrible, it is even awful at times.The acting, apart for the good performance by Gary Oldman, is average and even mediocre at times. Winona Ryder is pretty disappointing in it. Keanu Reeves it's in one of his best performances here, and still that's not saying too much. Anthony Hopkins is meh, neither good nor bad, just mildly convincing. The first sequence, explaining how 'Draculia' turns in 'Dracula' has one of the worst acting efforts I've seen in a long while. But despite that, it's not as big as a problem as the editing is. Frankly, it's a disappointing film mostly because it had everything to be a great and big one. It seems that everything was done badly and in the laziest and campy way possible. A shame. One of Coppola's weakest efforts. 5.7/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

'Gary Oldman' is really a group of actors performing under that name,"This is Coppola's inexcusably long but entertaining incarnation of Stoker's timeless 'Dracula'. Seeing it for the first time, I was sort of stunned by the theatricality of the the whole spectacle. It regrettably seems as though the heaviest weapon in the director's arsenal is style ¬ñ and it shows in the large scale of sets, among other things.The story should be well-known and here it opens faithfully in an intense prologue, setting the grisly and dramatic tone for the film. In the fiery midst of 15th century battle, Romanian warrior Vlad the Impaler denounces Christianity when his wife kills herself because she believes him dead ¬ñ and is banished as a vampire as revenge by God. Cut to 1897 Victorian Europe, bursting with costumes, period tints and fine wine and the soon-to-be-married couple Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves) and Mina Murray (Winona Ryder). Dracula now lives immortally in his dusty old castle where he imprisons Jonathan in the dungeons with his vampire brides... all to reconnect with Mina who is a reincarnation of his wife.The above plot outline is by nature supernatural and over-the-top and Coppola rigorously subscribes to loyalty in translating the novel. It is therefore a highly exaggerated extravaganza, no hyperbole. With vivid special effects, lavish Gothic sets, melodramatic mannerisms, swooning maidens and evil-laughing villains, 'Dracula' takes and shakes you with flair and makes no pretense about it. This approach naturally renders whatever comedy emerges from the melodrama as camp as a row of tents, but we accept it because it is easy to get sucked in the sheer fun of the spectacle. All the while Coppola nods politely to classic horror with bloody gore that splatters in orgies.Performances arguably take a backseat to the theatricality of the set. Yet, there are fine actors to be found when weeding through the lesser 'performances'. Speaking of which, let me debunk the myth that Keanu Reeves is awful as Jonathan Harker. Yes, his casting is plain puzzling ¬ñ as is his permanent expression ¬ñ but between all the ludicrous impersonations of his accents throughout the years (""¬Ödude""), I was almost positively surprised. The resident Hollywood deer-eyed damsel in distress Winona Ryder aptly chips in as Dracula's doomed maiden, who has now been reborn. It is no easy character to portray realistically but Ryder makes Mina/Elisabetha work fairly well.But Dracula ¬ñ character and film ¬ñ belongs to Gary Oldman. Is there no character this man cannot believably inhabit? I think not. Here Oldman's chameleon-like charisma shapes and molds itself to form a perfectly charismatic and sometimes bruised Vlad/Dracula. I'm slowly reaching the conclusion that 'Gary Oldman' is really a group of actors performing under that name. It is also thanks to him that we are offered a few genuinely emotionally poignant moments, such as embracing Winona or the tragic and compelling fate of his past life, through the flashback device (which was very good in general).Conclusion? Coppola has not created anything remarkable here; he ticks off a few too many clich√©s from the horror formula, even rehashing Dracula riffs; the acting is occasionally hammy; the whole thing often tips over into showy; it is too long ¬ñ but weed through those shortcomings and Dracula is an epic horror adventure, interweaving love, lust, betrayal, passion, sin, jealousy, blood and eroticism in drafty old castles.7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Awful adaptation of the book,"I saw Bram Stoker's Dracula last year without having any knowledge whatsoever of the book. As I watched it, I was almost certain that it was an inaccurate representation as there is so much vile nudity and violence that it seemed to be a glimpse into Coppola's disgusting, misogynistic brain rather than a 19th Century classic. I have just finished the book and I would like to proudly say I am correct. Although the book subverts women entirely and paints them as weak, timid creatures that need to be protected by men, they are at least far from wanton (except, of course, for the siren-like vampires). Lucy's character is completely corrupted from what Stoker intended her to be, and never in the book does Mina even have the slightest desire to become a vampire. There is NO love between Dracula and Mina and this is absolutely crucial to the story. This does NOT add a 'cool twist,' nor make the story any more interesting. It betrays the original Victorian notions that are embedded into the story and turns it into a gratuitous, abhorrent representation of modern Hollywood. Dracula is the embodiment of pure evil; he abhors life, purity, goodness and wishes to gather as many that he can to join in his evil existence and to do his bidding. The love in this story comes from Van Helsing, Dr Seward and most of all the love between Jonathan and Mina. The ending of the book captures this beautifully, yet this horrid film (no pun intended) fails to graciously offer its audience a glimpse into what this story is about.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best Dracula Ever,"When I first watched this, I had just read the book and was expecting for a really faithful adaptation of it. So at that time, I was fairly disappointed. The movie looked great, but Coppola's vision of it, changing some of the core elements of the story, bothered me. I thought, as well, that the ending felt kinda hurried.Now I rewatched it, with another vision, and damn. I was able to enjoy it a lot more, and be sure that this is the best Dracula movie ever made. It's gorgeously beautiful and also the story is different from the original, but it fits greatly if you pay good attention. Gary Oldman, as well, is just undisputable amazing.There's a reference to the Nosferatu classic in this movie, which I found very funny and it's bloody, really bloody. I love that! So, ten out of ten. A masterpiece!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The greatest Vampire masterpiece ever made in film,There are no words to describe this movie without diminishing its value and essence.For this masterpiece only feelings can describe the sensation it creates in the mind.Its elegance and mystery and allure are breathtaking.Gary Oldman personified the essence of the legend of Drakula and the supporting roles were also great.I highly recommend this movie to all Vampire and movie lovers because it is a timeless classic that should be placed in the hall of movie records forever.Gary Oldman and Bram Stoker did not receive the deserving credit for this masterpiece.It takes a great mind to understand the value of this art.,10.0,Anonymous,Horror
beautifully crafted piece of horrific love,"Of course, all dracula fans know the story and have heard it few too many times.  But, it seems as if coppola's version is somewhat different than it predecessor's.  What you must realize when watching this movie is that it is not about terror of vampires or the wrath of nosferatu, but simply about love, the universal subject of the world.   Though this seems clearly shown throughout the movie, it has come to my attention that most people have not recognized the tragedy for what it really is. Though it is violent and gory, it is also entrancing.  With the strange visuals throughout the movie including the weird blue and green lights that were almost groundbreaking in 1992, it seems that it enhanced the viewing of the movie and also knowing that they spent time on the horror element of the film rather than always focusing on romance.The part of the film I didn't like was the first-person view of the beast running through the woods.  Now, I will admit in 1992, this was probably scary, but I think that Evil Dead 2 just totally ruined that scene.  Evil Dead 2 being a very funny movie, did not mean in any way to harm the viewing of this masterpiece I am sure, but the fact of the matter is, it almost seems like it was copied.  After seeing ED2, this part made the movie cheesy in a way, and I did not like that feeling.What made up for the ED2 cheesiness though, was the very solid cast and their very solid acting.  Gary Oldman, Anthony Hopkins, Winona Ryder, and Keanu Reeves! What a cast!  Probably the best cast in a ""horror"" film ever. Anthony Hopkins ranking way up there on my favorite actors list of all time, sord of stole the show at times, but I was glad to see not all the time, leaving more room for the other actors to show their great talent.  The cast made some of the shallow gore into a dramatic showing of epic proportions. It was like the cast felt the script when they were acting it.  The acting will remain in memory along with some of the best acting ever (Titus, Magnolia, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Silence of the Lambs, Nsferatu, American History X etc.)Overall this movie towers over other dracula films (except for nosferatu of course) and is a must-see for any film lover of any kind, but remember to be awake and to clench your teeth.*********/********** 9/10",,Anonymous,Horror
Maybe TOO close to the original? Marred by some curious casting.,"I love Bram Stoker's novel which is surprisingly rich from a literary point of view and absolutely a must-read for anyone who loves good literature. Except for the opening and some curious changes in the ending, this is indeed faithful to the book. But Coppola never quite pulls off what Visconti does in ""The Leopard"", recapturing the spirit of the novel while making the story his own (and re-arranging it in some regards). This almost feels like the Masterpiece Theater version. My main quibbles are with the casting. There are American actors who can pull off English accents in a natural way but Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves really aren't among them. Given the importance of their characters, that was a distraction for me. Gary Oldman did a fine job given the director's choice, but my own view of Dracula in his blood-fed state is more like Sean Connery in his prime. The lean and pretty Count was simply not my idea of the character. Hopkins is always interesting and I enjoyed his work here, but there is lean and capable quality to the character in the book. Tom Waits gets kudos for being completely unrecognizable as Renfield. It's a good film, but I never really settled into it as I would have liked.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Amazing... And Then There's Keanu.,"Dracula may be -the- most uneven movie I have ever seen. I would give it a true '10'... and rank it as one of the most interesting movies ever made if they could somehow digitally replace Keanu Reaves. As he did in 'Much Ado About Nothing', his surfer dude persona sticks out like a sore thumb. It's such a huge mis-casting because the rest of the production is just so captivating.Music, sets, costumes, old school effects (I mean seriously old school---like right out of the 20's and 30's). The acting is also fantastically over the top---again it's like watching something from the 30's or 40's. Some of the side parts are hammy, but frankly, that's kind of the idea.Oddly enough, the one exception to the over-acting is the lead: Oldman's Dracula is a tour de force. He plays The Count in 5-6 'versions' and in each guise he is a -presence-. (And BTW, his accent is amazing. His renderings only add to his gravitas... no Bela Lugosi jokes here.)Can't recommend it enough if a) you can get in the spirit of English romances (I always think of Rebecca) and b) you can get past Keanu.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Immature viewers wont enjoy the complexity. 10/10,"The depth and grace OLDMAN displays is on par with some of the most iconic characters portrayed of ALL cinematic history and time. This is the version of Dracula that sets the alltime bar there was the pure raw aristocratic power of menacing oppulant presence though effortlessly vunerable stylistically done with an effortless transistional charm from prince to satanic fiend... this makes up for the casting of winona rider as his long lost love, and keanu reeves as harker who as an actor i mostly enjoy. But in this role he seems awkward and bill and ted like performance. Couldnt shake his surfer dudeness in this one.

"Glorious film-making but awkward storytelling, a wobbly epic","Dracula (1992)Well, I know this is the holy grail of Dracula movies for some people, and it really is luminous, dazzling, epic, and original. Coppola is a fabulous director at his best, but his movies have been up and down (very very up and somewhat down, of course), and this is big big budget effort, and it might actually strain from its own weight. It really is an attempt to give the legend a seriously timeless treatment, taking on a complicated layering of story lines and some unbelievable set design.But it's also a pastiche, a collage of references and clich√©s, and downright filmic excess. To that extent it's a kind of comic book version, trading realism for heightened and simplified effects. It's bloated and in fact probably needed to be longer to make sense of some of the narrative confusions and abrupt edits.There are moments, to be sure, of amazing period sets and costumes. And moments of sheer beauty, with of a kind of time-travel wonder that makes it worth watching. Gold Oldman for me may be a good actor (in the way Keanu Reeves is not) but he lacks some kind of cutting charisma necessary for a real Dracula. Other stars illuminate their scenes well--Anthony Hopkins (with a stilted accent) and Winona Ryder (impeccable)--and the supporting cast is perfect for the flavor of the film. Even Tom Waits, whose role is more Monty Python absurdism than anything, fits in to the glitziness (and bloodiness) overall.So, what to say? This will wow a lot of people, and rightfully. It's romantic in a galactic way. It has fast camera and glorious front to back focus and lighting effects to make the most ordinary scenes come alive. And there are not ordinary scenes. This is, by any account, an extraordinary movie, to be enjoyed for the sheer gluttonous tactile feel.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Wonderful costumes by Eiko Ishioka, some of them barely seen. Incredible music by Woiciek Kilar for an incredibly atmospheric movie.Enjoyable Anthony Hopkins as cynical Van Helsing, and Gary Oldman as charming Dracula: a clever transposition of sympathies. There is abundance of cultural references to art history (the Gorgon, oriental art, paintings, 19th century gardens...) and to the time in which Stoker's novel is set (e.g. Van Helsing saying something about electromagnetic fields, then the state of the art in science, cinema itself and, interestingly, Mina naming Mme.

Beautiful Film!,"I saw this movie for the very first time today and I thank Comcast On Demand for their allowing me to do this. I had heard of Coppola's adaptation of Stoker's masterpiece but had never gotten around to viewing the film, fearing that it would ruin the original classic for me. Was I wrong! The film is rightly name ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" for a reason. I couldn't imagine that a film maker could come as close to the classic novel as Coppola so eloquently did. Several factors contributed to this.James V. Hart's screenplay closely followed the events written down by Stoker so long ago. This included no phony or suave versions of so many Dracula's that we have seen before. This makes for a creepier and more real feeling horror movie.Micheal Ballhaus' breathtaking cinematography makes you feel as if this film were actually made in the time that it takes place. Transylvania is often portrayed as red, backing the grisly theme of the Count's tragic and grisly story.Lastly, I applaud Coppola for turning around every stereotypical vision of Dracula that has ever been made, and turning it into his own, which is probably the closest to Stoker's version.Bram Stoker's Dracula is, with no doubt, the best version of the classic novel (arguably better than the Bela Lugosi favorite). Coppola does not portray Dracula as only evil, but by the end of the movie you almost feel as if you pity the life that he has led, full of suffering and lack of love.Undoubtedly, 10/10!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Gorgeous to Watch,"I adore this film. Francis Ford Coppola crafts a tragically epic romantic horror adaptation from the source material of Bram Stoker's classic vampire story Dracula. The film is primarily a melodrama that refuses to ever hold back on the special effects and sometimes over-the-top theatrics, but it all fuses together extremely well with the stripped back performances of Gary Oldman and Winona Ryder. I also enjoyed the film because whilst it appeals to a film-conscious audience, it also stays truthful to the book and does the novel justice.

The Greatest Vampire Flick Ever,"This is a great, if not equally appreciated, movie. The sets look true to the period, as are the clothes, the plot is a lot closer to the original novel with all of Mina Westernra's finally added and just the right amount of light nudity to hold a guy's interest (Oh boy,Am I going to get mail on that comment!). The only thing I didn't like was the lack of how Dracula got to be a vampire; because he wished it ? Winona Ryder and Sadie Frost are sexy, and Keanu Reeves pulls off a fair if not befuddled performance as if he's still rather distracted by his scene with the female vampires. ""Were two of them glued together at the crotch ?"" Cary Elwes is one of the heroes, but at times Anthony Hopkins' Van Helsing looks like Hannibal Lecter ! The score in the theater,though, was deafening, but is appreciated much more on video. Gary Oldham makes me forget he once played Lee Harvey Oswald, but then he is almost indistinguishable as the young or old Dracula. His wig was lampooned hysterically by Leslie Nielsen in ""Dracula:Dead and Loving It.""

Why Did Francis Cast Keanu?,"Okay, I'll get to it.  This potentially great film will unfortunately be most memorable to me for containing the worst performance by an actor I have ever seen in a quality major motion picture.  That performance is by Keanu Reeves.Now.  I am not backing away from my judgement by saying that Keanu Reeves is, in fact, not that bad of an actor.  I actually thought he did a good job in ""Parenthood"", and, if I'm going to be honest, he helped make ""The Matrix"" work.However, Reeves performance as Harker is staggering in its ineptitude.  It's not just the accent.  His reactions (key to a film actor's work) to events around him were either inappropriate or non-existent.  His chemistry with Winona Ryder (who I think did an adequate job here, particularly in her attraction to Gary Oldman) was also non-existent.  Was he supposed to be bland so we would actually root for Lucy to be with Dracula?  Well, folks, there's such a thing as stacking the deck so blatantly that you cheat the audience, and this is an overwhelming example of it.I have to say Francis Ford Coppola has to take at least half the blame here. Why did he cast Keanu in that role?  If he had to cast an American to balance Winona, why didn't he cast someone who could play the role, or at least was right for the role?  Did the studio force him to cast Keanu? Remember, this is the man who fought a titanic battle with Paramount over casting Al Pacino in ""The Godfather"".  Of course, this is also the man who cast Sophia Coppola in ""Godfather III"".Sorry, Gary Oldman.  I thought your semi-sympathetic portrayal of Dracula was more than worthy.  And although Anthony Hopkins overworked Van Helsing, his portrayal was also noteworthy.  But you both were working against the tide.And sorry, Keanu.  I don't think you're a bad actor.

"Dracula, but not Bram Stoker's","Director Coppola and screenwriter James V. Hart have worked hard to avoid the clich√©s of the vampire film (or of the Dracula film itself, since there have been so many adaptations of Stoker's 1897 novel that it's practically a genre unto itself). The result is visually arresting, occasionally spectacular, but too often unintentionally funny as Coppola experiments with light, shadows and color and Gary Oldman, as the cursed Count Dracula, morphs from nobleman to living corpse to bat creature to werewolf with dazzling frequency. Whereas in the original novel, every character was earnestly sympathetic except the titular monster, here it's the reverse; Ryder's Mina is definitely the star of the show, carrying the greatest emotional weight as she gradually finds Dracula more alluring than her dull fiance Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves), the brutal, sexually threatening van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins) and the obsessed Renfield (Tom Waits, unbearable as always). Although the title, Bram Stoker's Dracula, promises fidelity to the source material, in fact the source material is often betrayed by quirks in sets, costuming and characterization that work too hard to draw attention to themselves.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

A worthy adaptation of a classic tale.,"Fans of the old Dracula movies and of the original Bram Stoker novel may be it a little disappointed since the movie is not entirely purist.However,old stories have to be adapted to be told to modern day audiences.I believe that this movie achieves this. Firstly,It is visually stunning and the use of surreal images and creepy shadows accentuated Dracula as being a man of great power and of deep emotion.Also the emsemble cast delivered the acting goods,particularly Gary Oldman and Anthony Hopkins.The emphasis on romance  augments the story since I believe that Bram Stoker as well as other novelists must have fantasised of a love for a woman being strong enough to conquer death. I believe that Francis Ford Copolla has paid tribute to one of the most well known stories of all time.It will be well worth the rental money.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent,"It's not really Bram Stoker's Dracula, it's Coppola's Dracula, plus Oldman and Hopkins, and that's plenty. Lots of blood; more would have been better (I guess they wanted the R rating rather than X; too bad). Oldman is superb. Hopkins is funky, funny, eccentric, excellent. Ryder - well, I actually think they should have made her into a cousin visiting from America, and told her to drop the English accent entirely, because the accent is atrocious, and comes close to sinking every scene she's in. The costuming is stunning. Coppola's direction is very fine, with a few bumps here and there. I might just add that Coppola's commentary on the DVD is flat, bored-sounding, and almost entirely lacking in cool details - unusual for him and quite disappointing.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Francis Coppola's Dracula,"With a new version of 'Nosferatu' currently in cinemas now is a good moment to recall this earlier film of the original book by Francis Ford Coppola: the first of two adaptations of classic gothic novels that employed the gimmick of including the original author's name in the title.Described by David Denny in 'New York Magazine' as ""the hotel Fontainebleu of vampire movies - a vulgar monstrosity with too many climaxes (and hence no climax)""; despite the title it's not really any more faithful than earlier adaptations of Stoker's book. But a lot of money has plainly gone on the production design; while Anthony Hopkins lends his usual presence to the part of Van Helsing.As the Count himself although wearing an assortment of sometimes extravagantly foolish outfits Gary Oldman at least makes a game attempt at a Transylvanian accent.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best Dracula movie hands down!! A+,"This movie has such an incredible Victorian period piece impact with amazing story, great acting, super casting with A list actors, beautiful appropriate music and manages to be scary as well as being a love story.

I cannot imagine anyone intelligent not finding this movie captivating, sexy, potent, and worth watching multiple times. An absolute gem!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Should be renamed Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula,"This movie almost follows the novel. The count comes to England and is then chased back home. In addition there is the love story which is well done and truly touching. The sets and costumes are marvellous and those alone make the movie woth seeing.But except for Jonathon Harker's interactions with the count at the castle, this movie is not scary. Gary Oldman is scary as the old count and he makes the film. But the rest of the movie is mystery and eroticism and there is little horror involved.The characters are also somewhat different than as written. Mina Harker and Lucy Westenra are apparently nymphomaniacs. Van Helsing has been written down to nothing more than a talkative perverted  Dutchman. Thank God Renfield has been left untampered.If you have to see this film, expect to be somewhat scared for the first forty minutes and awed by the ambience of the film throughout. But this is not Bram Stoker's Dracula. That Irishman would have never written characters like the ones in this film.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Wickedly Fantastic,"To anyone who has ever read Bram Stoker's Dracula, I have to ask why? Because, although I am an avid reader I found the book to be exceedingly dull. If this movie had followed the book nobody would have went to see it. I love this movie for it's feel of darkness and the great ambiance it sets. And although people harp about this and that, the movie is not really about horror, gore and Bram Stoker's book so much, as it is about love. To me, the human condition (or vampire in this case) is what supremely interesting movies are about.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Visually stunning,"Vampire movies seem to be one of the most popular genres in film, both past and present. I'm no huge fan of the genre, but this is an interesting movie well worth the attention.The solicitor Renfield is sent to far-away Transylvania to negotiate a purchase of an estate in London. The buyer is the mysterious count Dracula. Soon though it dawns on Renfield that the count is a vampire who plans on stealing his fianc√© and having his way with the people of London.The book ""Dracula"" by Bram Stoker is an interesting book i think. It's not what i would call brilliant in any way. But still the way it's told, in letters between the main characters and entries into their diaries, is interesting. This movie is one of the few i have seen that at least tries a little to follow this concept and does it successfully. I won't elaborate much on the story since it is well known to most people.More than anything this movie is a feast for the eyes and ears. The cinematography and camera-work is outstanding. The effects are also very very good and the music is a masterpiece from composer Wojciech Kilar. Gary Oldman is magnificent as count Dracula and further heightens the experience. The rest of the cast are also mostly well cast. Unfortunately one of the things that really disturbs me is Keanu Reeves portraying the important character Renfield. I can't understand why they would choose to use Keanu Reeves with a thick obviously fake accent when there are so many good British actors around. When will film-makers realize that the audience DO appreciate a good actor rather than a big name on the poster?!The focus in this film is on the love story. Something that contributes to the fact that you many times feel sympathetic towards the vampire. And it also lends a warmth to the story that many other similar films lack. Still this remains a faithful rendition of the book, well adapted for the big screen. Well made, mostly well acted and beautiful like few other movies. I would rate this experience 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Absolutely perfect movie... about love,"If you want to see a horror movie than please select a different movie - this is not for you.'Dracula' is not a horror movie.It is a movie about love. Love that goes beyond all boundaries, even that of death. Love that gives happiness, grief, despire, and peace in the end.It is also a movie about what people can do for love. To give life, earthly or eternal, is only a start.The movie itself is a masterpiece with great Gary Oldman showing all full range of emotion as Count Dracula. His acting is, well, magnetizing. His ability to show loneliness, hope, adoration hidden between the lines is really Oscar-worthy. Great supporting roles of Winona Ryder as Wilhelmina (sic!) Murray and young Keanu Reeves (well, some will tell that he had about 600 years when filming). With Cary Elwes as Lord Arthur Holmwood (he got his title since Robin Hood), and Tom Waits (when Jeremy Irons), as Mr. Renfield - this was another brilliant role. I will never forget performances of Sadie Frost as Lucy Westenra, beautifull and hmm... playful, and Billy Campbell with top-notch depiction of Quincey P. Morris. And Anthony Hopkins... his performance as Abraham van Helsing is mesmerizing, to the point that I would pay alle the money I have to sit in his classroom.Excellent music score by Polish composer Wojciech Kilar gives thrills to this day, especially arrousing feeling of danger in 'Vampire Hunters' and in 'The Storm'. I remember listening to this track sitting close to soviet IS-2 tank, it gave me chills.End credits by Annie Lennox are absolutely beautifull summary of the movie. I absolutely admire her as a songwriter here.And, to sum up, this is one of the movies that I think are way better than books they are based on.If I were to create a list of things to do before you die, or rather - things that I am greatful for - 'Dracula' will be somewhere on top of the list.

Pretty good movie actually,"Okay, this movie was a great vampire film, but there were some things i wasn't so crazy about.  First of all, what is up with Lucy (Sadie Frost) kissing Mina (Winona Ryder)???  I read the book, and it may be my small attention span, but i don't remember anything like that.  And even if the book DID mention something like that, why did it have to be in the film??? Also, Renfield (Tom Waits) could have had a larger role.  And was it really necessary to have a close-up of the bugs he was eating?  But overall, this movie was pretty good, I give it a 9/10.",,Anonymous,Horror
Some flaws and some outstanding aspects,"Must-see overall. The flaws: the first part is quite clunky, the script makes no effort in trying to make things believable or coherent. Reeves is awful (he is nominated for the worst miscasting ever). Van Helsing is quite annoying, dull character and over-the-top at the same time. Some outdoor scenographies and lighting are absymal (Coppola choose to shoot everything on stage to avoid production delays). Some dialogues are silly, the XIX century language sounds weird at times. Some visual effects in the first act look quite dated and ridiculous.But once the story gets going, most of these shortcomings disappear. Seems like Coppola spent all of his effort on the second and third act. The pace becomes faster. There are several jumps forward in time that help build a tragic/romantic/oniric atmosphere. The show is stealed by Ryder (perfect in acting her possession and dilemma) and Oldman. Oldman is a force of Nature: dramatic, empathic, pompous. Their love story is outstanding, spanning four centuries on the notes of a dedicated musical theme. Dracula's character becomes deep and human. The ending is well conceived. Meanwhile, Coppola starts showing his best visual effects one by one - both camera effects and prosthetics. Dracula is a powerful, mesmerizing presence, in each of his many shapes: impeccably elegant englishman, creepy old man, haunting beast. Visually the movie reaches its height during the final scene outside of the castle, that is a thing of beauty. Overall, the movie is a powerful, baroque and truly romantic narration of a XIX century tale.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Damn, This Movie Didn't Have To Be As Long As Dracula's Life","This movie is unnecessarily long.  No, it's not a three hour film, but it didn't have to be as long as it was.  It just kept going on and on.  At least `Nosferatu (1922)' made it's point and was done.  This film had every little detail, and kept going on.Gary Oldman was a terrible Dracula.  They could've at least made him look like Count Orlock rather than a stylish character.  Or, if they wanted a stylistic character, than they could've casted a better actor, that wasn't so ugly.  Maybe more of a nice face.  It just seemed too weird that a guy as ugly as Gary Oldman, could get with a hot woman like Winona Ryder.  But it wasn't just his looks, he was too old also.  If you want to see a good Dracula movie, see Nosferatu.On the upside, the casting and acting was great; besides Gary Oldman.  It really respected it's story, and made it one of a kind.  Although I had a lot of disappointments, I still think this film deserves a 7/10.  I am being very harsh on this movie, since it's a remake, but I suggest you go out and rent it and judge it for yourself.  Trust me, it is certainly not a waste of money.  This is a movie that'll give one another various opinions.  Watch it.7/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A diachronic gothic horror film,"First of all, I would like to mention that I enjoy reading gothic literature and I was really exited about watching this film based on Bram Stoker's book. Eventually I really liked this movie but I expected something better. The plot was average and the movie was so long with many scenes that were actually unnecessary. The characters were well-written and well-developed (especially Dracula). I really liked the dark and gothic atmosphere that in my opinion was the best element of the movie. Lastly the cinematography was really good but some graphics were a little silly however the score was really good also. To sum up, ""Dracula"" was a cult classic dark romance horror film that I would recommend to people that enjoy gothic romance and vampire horror.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

I can tell he was influenced by Murnau in this movie but he still succeeded in making it very original.Winona Ryder is so beautiful in this movie and she plays Mina with the delicacy and vulnerability that was required by her character. Keanu Reeves played Jonathan Harker with the innocence that was necessary even though many people ridiculed him.

Gary manages to perfectly embodies a more human Dracula who in appearance resembles Vlad the Impaler. Wynona Rider, Keanu Reeves and Anthony Hopkins also manage to do their job well. Anthony is a very good Van Helsing. The rest of the production is a work of art. The soundtrack is quite memorable adding the song by Annie Lennox.

"Great Film, Reviewable, and cunning, read between the lines","Francis Ford Coppola is a genius with everything is this film. Some critics may find the film contains excessive amounts of blood, but has anyone stopped to think, that Coppola is providing metaphors for the audience if only they would stop to figure it out. The 80's and early 90's were highlighted as the years aids did it's worst to people living in the UK, Coppola highlights this by showing excessive amounts of blood on-screen, which is needed for the transfer of HIV, and the sharing of blood between Lucy and her suitor, when he gives a blood donation as she lies in a coma. The film is excellent, and who really cares if it doesn't mirror the book's text? It's the definitive Dracula film and cinema and text are supposed to be two totally different mediums anyway. Gary Oldman gives an impeccable performance etc.. I wont go on as you've already read this. Keanu Reeves although not as polished as the other cast members, does actually try to be English, so credit is given where it's due in my opinion. Mise-en-scene (everything in the picture) and sound work flawlessly together, and the film is capable of touching the audience, because of it's heart-wrenching narrative. Gary Oldman the ultimate Vampire gets my vote, because for the first time ever in the history of vampire films, you are shown that he has human feelings too and is capable of loving another, and feeling emotions.

A visual painting,The first time I saw this film was during it's initial theatrical release and I did not like it.  Later I bought the laser disc and upon subsequent viewings I was literally amazed at the artistry the director infused into the film.  Each time I view this film I am fascinated by every articulate detail.  I now have the Superbit Edition on DVD and the film looks like a beautifully rendered painting brought to life.  It's a real visual and sonic treat especially when viewed on a wide screen HDTV and progressive scan DVD player.  The eerie Dolby Digital 5.1 sound track only enhances the cinema experience.  I can now view this masterpiece at home at the best available quality than was available in the theater when I first viewed it.  Though the film tends to drag a bit especially towards the end.  It's still an amazing film to watch and it gets even better with each viewing.  It is by far my favorite version of this horror classic.,8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Seriously flawed, brilliantly daring.","Overblown in every sense of the word, Bram Stoker's Dracula is a perfectly grand and lavish adaptation of the original story, one that captures the tragedy of its titular character but with a narrative full of confusion and dead ends. Pleasurable as all this knowing bravado is, something is lost, coming across less as a new version of Stoker's novel and more as an annotated commentary on it. It lacks the drive, the creepiness and the necessary brevity of the best film adaptations; being sinfully overlong at 123 minutes and containing a middle passage that drags its nails through the mud, a passage that nearly lost me. Opulent and lustrous, it never makes much sense at the character level, but glistens with such dark, carbuncular magnificence and is fueled by such an elixir of sexual yearning that's hard to deny with a murky tidal pull. Coppla's direction is simply incredible, with so many brilliant creative shot choices, Michael Ballhaus' photography is luscious and the production design succeeds in pulling you into its period with an operatic soundscape; one that prioritises the romantic elements of Dracula's character, although not in the hypnotically seductive manner, instead it's more desperation for love, incel Dracula if you will. That being said, the towering performance by Gary Oldman is astonishing, one that pays its reverence to Lugosi's rendition, with Oldman's voice commanding your attention at every turn, ironing out the hockey dialogue in one fell swoop. Hopkins' Van Helsing is a wonderful folly and while yes Keanu's attempt at an accent is laughable, it is not nearly as bad as people have told me over the years, although you can't tease me with such a limited amount of vampiress Monica Bellucci, I will not stand for it. I won't I tell you! Ultimately, Coppola's Dracula is seriously flawed, but it also brilliantly daring. One that's in desperate need of a trim here and there to become the gothic masterpiece it so deserves to be.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
quick reviews!,"The second of the literal horror movies from the nineties on my top 150 list, Dracula is a success because of the chemistry between Oldman and Ryder, two of the most versatile actors around. Of the billions of stories told about Dracula, this one looks the most authentic, although, like most others, it strays from the text to suit its own desires. Reeves is not the greatest choice for Jonathan, but the rest of the cast are perfect, including Hopkins as the enthusiastic Van Helsing, and Tom Waits as Renfield. Gory in parts, with sublime dialogue, the only let down may be that the whole romantic angle is taken too far, that we may feel too much sympathy towards Dracula. The final few scenes are stand outs.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Blood....,"Ok, plain and simple, i loved this movie.There is very little else to say to be honest, this movie had everything in it which i think makes a good movie. It has cute actors (Keanu Reeves...) it has a MAJOR bad guy (Dracula) and also it has a soppy, but (somehow) believeable love story stacked in the middle! This movie fortutantly, relys on the ""old"" method of doing effects, there is some CGI filming technolgy here, but it is alot of old fashioned techniques used as well, and in my opinion this is what makes the movie the more freaky!I love the scenes at the castle and also the characters add to the movie as well, you can't have a movie as creepy as this and then have some crappy characters who don't know how to act! This is why i thought the film and the characters were well thought out and extremely well made.I like the fact that in this movie they FINALLY use Ol' ""Vlads"" powers as they were meant to be i.e. He CAN sustain direct sunlight, but it bloody weakens him unlike the myth which says he can't. So i was glad to see that go in. Also i liked the love story behind it and how God forgives all in the end, it made me wanna cry... NOT! But it was a well crafted story line and it did have its moments, i wish i could tell you what they were.. but if you're looking for a movie in which you don't have to worry about how much the director has put into special effects, this movie does have special effects, but they don't domainate it like other movies *COUGH PHANTOM MENANCE COUGH!*Go see this movie, have a few chills at the scary movies and then go home with your b/f or g/f and wonder if you could really last over 600 years (or so) in waiting for your true love, it makes you think don't it?",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Rubbish,"If you appreciate terrible set-design, bad lighting, gruesome effects, awful casting and incongruous overstated music.... This film is for you! The ONLY redeeming feature of this film is Gary Oldman (as mentioned ad-nauseam by all the other reviewers). This is a lame story, with some appalling acting thanks mostly to the casting. Keanu Reeves seldom is anything but wooden (with the delightful exception of his role in The Gift - where he aptly played a redneck) but with the addition of an English accent we now have a wooden Reeves alloyed with an out-of-his-depths Depp in 'From Hell' - a similarly dodgy slock- horror thing. If you appreciated the realism and grit of Coppola's Apocalypse Now, you'll hate this as I did. Everything that was awesome about that film is conspicuously absent in this one.

He is both dramatic and comedic. Sadie Frost gives a lasting impression as the doomed Lucy Westerna. She gives a new look and feel to the character that has never been done before. She is both sexy and vulnerable. Winona Ryder gives her best performance as Mina Murray Harker, who falls for the charming Count. Gary Oldman has never been better as the vampire Count, as he changes from old & decrepit to wolf to hunk to bat... Keanu Reeves gives a mediocre performance as Jonathan Harker.

"Yeah, pretty good","Despite the fact that I love horror, love vampires and like to think I can appreciate a stellar cast, I never really did 'get' 1992's 'Bram Stoker's Dracula.' Yeah, I thought it was pretty good and own a copy, but for a film that's so loved by so many, I just thought I should enjoy it more than I do.It's a decent interpretation of the book (so I've been told!), but I must confess to never actually reading the original source text. It's extremely well directed and the acting is top notch (or at least so much of the acting is good we can most likely overlook Keanu Reeves' British accent!). It's the timeless tale of Dracula and how - in the opening montage - he's semi tricked into renouncing God after the love of his life takes her own life when she thinks he died in battle. Therefore, Drac decides to take his vengeance out on the rest of the world by becoming an immoral vampire.I know a few people who criticised the film on its release said that it was more of a 'love story' than the horror movie that they were expecting. The 'love aspect' doesn't really bother me as it's a strong part of the characters' motivation and was quite original (for the time!). I guess now with so many other vampire films and TV shows out there which use a form of 'love triangle' this may all seem a little tired by now.I've watched the film plenty of times since its release and, despite me not loving it like the rest, I do think that it's Gary Oldman's performance as the titular vampire which really does keep me coming back. He takes on various monstrous incarnations of evil and, not only is the make-up and effects excellent, it's his ability to actually even make us feel a little sorry for the villain. There are plenty of other big names on the cast list (we'll ignore Keanu Reeves for now - bless him) and the other real stand-out is Anthony Hopkins, who seems to be enjoying hamming up his portrayal of legendary vampire hunter 'Van Helsing.'I know vampire media is everywhere these days, but few are as well acted and shot as 'Bram Stoker's Dracula.' It's definitely up there with the definitive examples of the genre, even if I do only watch it every few years.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

I Liked This For What It Had.,"Every generation needs a Dracula adaptation. Bram Stoker's Dracula in 1992 is one of the most faithful to the original text (or so I hear) and one of the scariest vampire movies ever made. The movie met with polarizing reviews, but I am pretty lenient--I think of this as a good popcorn flick on a Saturday night.Francis Ford Coppola does his best job in directing, even superior to Apocalypse Now. I'm not saying Dracula is even in the same ballpark as Apocalypse Now, but the way everything is set up and the general look of the films are stellar. As I mentioned earlier, this movie is pretty polarizing, but even the haters must admit how awesome this movie looked. The feel is fantastic, the camera movements are awesome, the set design/costume/make-up are all vibrant, the special effects are sick, the atmosphere is perfect, and the music is haunting. In other words, almost everything in front of the camera is done to precision. Then we get to the other things infant of the camera and most of what's behind it...The first flaw right off the bat is Keanu Reeves. I do think he is talented and does good performances. But Dracula shows that he cannot play everything well. His accent isn't as bad as people say, but other than that he isn't good as Jonathan Harker. Winona Ryder plays Mina, who is good in some scenes but bad in others. Everybody else is good, with Gary Oldman (of course) shining as Dracula.While most of the actors are good, the characterizations fall flat and the movie never really seems to find a sense of direction. There never really seems to be a rhyme or reason behind them, or clear motivation.

Francis Ford Coppola presents Bram Stoker's Dracula!,"Dracula has been done-to-death in popular culture what with him now being a longtime public domain darling: the character's been reimagined countless times more so than the actual story he came from. So it goes without saying that Bram Stoker's Dracula is just one of MANY Dracula films that have been made since the character basically left a big-bang impact on horror literature and pop-culture.The iconic vampire has now been deified as a misunderstood romantic who literally thirsts for blood, and is an embodiment of Eastern European eccentrics who long for a normal life out of the shadows of obscurity and isolation. I don't know if that's the intent, but still: Dracula has become a mascot for gothic culture and a 'model brooder' shunning normalcy. And honestly if you told me that the Godfather guy did this film, I'd be like ""this is more like Tim Burton than Francis 'Apocalypse Now' Coppola""! But the fact he did this was ballsy enough, and a character as tried-and-true as Dracula was definitely an interesting choice for the guy who made Don Vito Corleone a cinematic icon.Bram Stoker's Dracula has a lot of good stuff about it like the atmosphere and the story, but some of the acting and accents are as consistent as brevity in a B-movie from Ed Wood. Gary Oldman was great, but Keane Reeves and Winona Ryder left a lot to be desired; also, Anthony Hopkins being Van Helsing is very on-brand for a horror icon even if he's a good guy this time around.Having not seen this movie for eons but FINALLY seeing it recently, I can honestly say its reputation as a 90s classic is well warranted, both the good and bad stuff in it. 7/10 IMDbs. 3.5/5 stars. For all the good it does the story, it does just enough to stop it from being a 'perfect' representation of the Dracula story.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Stoker's Dracula done right...,"Of course, as an avid horror fan, then I am well-familiar with the classic and icon story from writer Bram Stoker, and thus also well-familiar with this 1992 adaptation of said novel. And I have to say that the 1992 movie from director Francis Ford Coppola is without a doubt one of the most entertaining, remarkable and watchable of ""Dracula"" movies out there.The storyline in ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", as written by Bram Stoker, and then apparently retouched by James V. Hart for this movie, is one that all horror afficianados should be familiar with. And if you aren't, well shame on you. It is a classic vampire tale, and one that takes the audience along on a very compelling and thrilling ride.I remember watching this movie in the cinema back in 1992, and of course I have watched it numerous times since then, be it on VHS, DVD and digitally. It is a certainly a movie with lots of replay value to it. And thus, I have seen it many times since 1992. And it is a movie that I warmly recommend.The acting performances in ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" is good, you just have to be lenient towards Keanu Reeves' odd English dialect. Nevertheless, ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" has an impressive cast ensemble, with the likes of Gary Oldman, Winona Ryder, Anthony Hopkins, Keanu Reeves, Richard E. Grant, Cary Elwes, Billy Campbell, Sadie Frost, Tom Wits, Monica Bellucci, Michaele Bercu, Florina Kendrick and many more. I have always been really impressed with Gary Oldman's performance in ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", because it is outstanding and he carries the movie phenomenally.Visually then ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" was and is impressive. The effects are great, as are the wardrobe, propbs, sets and make-up. Everything has that classic gothic touch to it, and it works marvelously.""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" is a milestone in the vampire-themed cinema, and it is one that you most certainly owe it to yourself to sit down and watch.My rating of ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" lands on a well-deserved nine out of ten stars.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

The rest of the cast is however, is fabulous.  Sadie Frost, Tom Waits, and Gary Oldman are incredible. The score is brilliant and the visual effects are amazing.  The film doesn't revert to the CGI tricks that most modern movies poorly utilize and it excells for that. I highly recommend this film to any fan of Bram Stoker's novel.  If you enjoy Tod Browning's 1931 borefest, however, stay away.  You'll get confused.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Beautiful film, pitiable Dracula character","Yours truly grew up during the early 90s and thus my first encounters with the classic and immortal horror sagas where the contemporary large-budgeted and bombastic blockbusters of prolific directors that starred a bunch of Hollywood icons. Kenneth Brannagh modernized ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"", Francis Ford Coppola revised ""Bram Stoker'""s Dracula"" and, to a lesser extent, there were also Mike Nichols' ""Wolf"" (the updated ""Wolf Man"") and Stephen Frears' ""Mary Reilly"" (basically ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" from a different viewpoint). They're all fine films and I still consider them as essential contributors to my love for the horror genre, but somehow, I wish that I started chronologically with the Universal horrors starring Lugosi, Karloff, Chaney, etc...This completely personal and irrelevant trivia note aside, Coppola's ambitious and prestigious retelling of ""Dracula"", which remains incredibly faithful to the original Bram Stoker novel, still stands as an overwhelming cinematic achievement. The film is 25 years old already in the meantime, but the decors, costumes, photography, make-up and special effects are still breathtaking even by today's high and sadly digitalized standards. ""Dracula"" is undoubtedly a pure work of art to behold, but putting the emphasis on the vampire count's romantic traumas and his pitiable craving to be reunited with his 15th Century's wife Elizabeta obviously didn't do the horror impact a lot of good. Count Dracula, once a bloodthirsty warrior who turned against God because his beloved wife killed herself, imprisons young attorney Jonathan Harker in his Transylvanian castle after he sees a picture of his fianc√©e Mina. She seemingly is the reincarnation of Elizabeta and thus Dracula travels to his recently purchased Carfax Abbey in Britain to reclaim her. Mina's best friend Lucy, and then Mina herself, immediately fall for Dracula's hypnotizing charms and mystical powers, but Lucy's three (!) lovers fight back and even call upon the help of the infamous Dr. Abraham Van Helsing.There's a good reason why Bela Lugosi and Christopher Lee are eternally reckoned for their respective roles as Count Dracula; - namely because they depicted him as an evil, invincible and relentless horror monster! Although Gary Oldman still remarkably succeeds in making his Dracula performance somewhat menacing and creepy, the script introduces the lead character as a grieving and immortal widower. Long white fingers, weird hairdos and diabolical laughter aside, this vampire isn't frightening. Gary Oldman is always great, even when the role is really difficult, but apart from him only Tom Waits puts down a memorable performance as Renfield. Anthony Hopkins is quite pompous as Van Helsing and both Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder are too immature for their roles. ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" nonetheless remains a must-see for every self-respecting horror fan (and even every film fan in general) if it were only for the lavish sets and stunning decors, the enchanting soundtrack (Annie Lennox' ""Love Song for a Vampire"" is a classic), the sublime photography and subtle display of eroticism (including a young Monica Belluci as a bride!) and the few but notably atmospheric moments of true horror (like the sequences inside Lucy's tomb)",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula (Leave Bram Stoker Out of This),"I think the biggest crime of Bram Stoker's Dracula...is the fact that it is called BRAM STOKER'S Dracula! Seriously, Coppola took such extreme liberties with the original text of the novel, that he shows some nerve by implying that his film is so definitive a treatment. In reality, this is the director's most schizophrenic masterpiece, astonishingly artful in some areas, distractingly clumsy in others. I mean, Keanu Reeves? He looks so adrift and horribly out-performed by everyone else in the cast. I like Anthony Hopkins and Gary Oldman's performances though. There have been MUCH better Dracula movies (Nosferatu, anyone?) and far more charismatic interpretations (Bela Lugosi, but for what it's worth, ""Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula"" is a worthy addition to the long and storied mythology of Bram Stoker's legendary idol.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

This Dracula sucked.,"I give you that the look of the film was good, the acting was adequate. The casting was terrible and done for the wrong reasons. And why must they constantly rewrite Stoker when they claim to be following his original work. My biggest complaint was Anthony Hopkins. Van Helsing is, according to Stoker, a well known and well admired physician and occultist, but the script, or Hopkins (a fine actor who I greatly admire) turned him into a raving eccentric and a rude one at that. Van Helsing, an old fashion European Gentleman would never had been as rude to Mina, as he was at the dinner after Lucy's staking. Keannu Reeves did not belong in the film either. He was totally unbelievable. And the special effects, which I often appreciate in and of themselves, actually detracted from the story. Although there was one, of Dracula gesturing with a hand and a cross bursting into flame, that I was able to incorporate into a live stage version of Dracula several years later. The film wasn't really all that bad, but I did cringe a lot when I watched it. Gary Oldman did an excellent job though, as very sympathetic Dracula, which in return made his character all that much more menacing. Still, sorry, not my favorite version.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The second best dracula movie,"""Dracula"" is one of the most popular characters in film history.  Yet, few 'vampire' films are on the same level as ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"".Even though it's no secret that Coppola watched ""Nosferatu"" (the best of the genre) before making this film, Coppola has added his own touch.  I can't think of any 'Dracula' film that started with the historical background of Vlad the Impailer in Romania/Transylvainia; nor can I think of a film director that captured the Victorian era better than Coppola (I love the stag film shown in the background during the 'white-wolf' scene in London). Finally, Coppola actually read the Bram Stoker book:  reading the source novel doesn't seem to be a popular Hollywood practice.I'm surprised at the negative reviews this film has received.  Coppola has guts for filming a big budget picture on sets, especially after losing it all by doing the same thing with the Las Vegas settings of ""One From the Heart"".  The sets and costumes were brilliant, as well as the cinematography (it reminded me of 'Excalibur'). Finally, Gary Oldman makes Bela Lugosi look like a boy scout.Coppola has made a couple of bad movie's in his career (need I mention ""Jack""?), yet ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" is not one of them.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Hey, If You're Gonna Go Goth...","...you might as well go all the way. In terms of production, camera work, score, and everything-but-the-kitchen-sink scene work, Donald Trump only wishes he were as rich as this film. Taken on that production level, it is almost reminiscent of a weekend with Jim Morrison in terms of excess. But somehow, this overly-sumptuousness works for such a tale as this. And yes, I do agree that in the terms of the original story, this telling is more faithful that the host of other movies made over the decades. If you have not read the original, I highly recommend it, but save it for Samhain :)Individual notes: Some of the casting in this is positively inspiring, especially Tom Waits as Renfield who was superb. Of course, the ubiquitous Gary Oldman as the Count was a casting inevitability, and he did not disappoint--pulling out so much that he gave new height to The Hilt that most actors aspire to! Boy, if ever there were a candidate for a remake of The 7 Faces Of Dr. Lao...And Sir Anthony Hopkins (slight pause for a reverent bow) captures the exact mood of the entire production in this film--bold, bawdy, lush, wicked and witty. There must have been some secret delight for him to go from the vampiric doctor in ""Lambs"" to the vampire-eradicator in this film. What other actor could find so much with so little?Now, the bad notes...I know that Winona Ryder was very keen on doing this film and tried her best, but she tried TOO hard, and it showed. Her accent was almost a caricature of the true British tongue, and she almost sounded like Carol Burnett imitating the Queen on her variety show. One reader commented on and questioned her gasping through the film; it could have been an attempt to look shy and easily frightened, but I'm going to chalk it up to an overly-tight corset. And where Ms. Ryder over-did her part, Mr. Reeves UNDER-did his. I, too, kept waiting for a ""dude"" to slip into his speeches. And his pronunciation of certain words had my friends and I giggling hysterically. Which is a shame, because in the book, the part of Jonathon Harker is a major and pivotal role...though not in this film, and I can't help but suspect that the fact that Harker was played by Reeves might be the reason that the Harker character was pared down dramatically from the book for this movie. But, because of the lavishness of the rest of the material, we don't miss it much.And rightly so, for this is not supposed to be a true remake of the book, but rather an experience. The true Victorian feel of the book gives way to the lustiness that would never have been expressed by Stoker (maybe not even realized...??). Why do we feel such sexual magnetism about the legend of the Count? There is something very sensuous about someone entering your mind and exerting intellectual will over yours. This was never more evident than in ""Lambs"", and in this modern version of Dracula. Also, I think what makes Dracula more appealing, particularly to females, is the way he exacts what he needs. Other fabled ""monsters"" merely slash, chop, dice, shoot, etc. There is no contact with the victim. But with Dracula, he supersedes the will of the victim by engulfing their will with his, he moves in close over them, draws from them in a ""kiss of life/death""...but does not kill the women. Instead he makes them his wives. And immortals. So not only does such a character appeal to some secret side of a woman's sexuality, but also feeds the human desire to live forever. That, to me, is why the Count survives as still the most feared, yet feared not, of all the movie ""monsters"". And these facts are what this movie captures - the written fable, the primal desire AND the imagined legend.So to sum up...Goth doesn't get better than this. Be prepared to laugh and lust. Give your will over to the bawdiness, and enjoy--it really is a carnival ride of a film.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
you can't go wrong with Gary Oldman,"Pluses: 1. Gary Oldman. Very different Dracula, but also very convincing. The truth is, all the other famous Draculas were great too (Lee, Kinsky).Oldman does it differently, but he is great. The Romanian that he speaks in the movie is remarkable, very slight accent. He even got the tone pretty well, this is not some pathetic American actor throwing away words in a foreign language. 2. Atmosphere and screenplay. Combination of Ken Russel and John Carpenter, pretty credible. Of course it's commercial, I think it was meant to be. The weeding in the Orthodox church was remarkably well done. 3. All actors except Keanu Reeves 4. I believe the sexual innuendo and scenes fit well with the story.Minuses: 1. Keanu Reeves. Sorry Keanu, but surfer, bozo or robot are just about your limits. 2. The gypsy characters. Mr. Coppola, those didn't look and act like Gypsies, they looked more like overdressed Mohawks. And that ""Gipsies willing to give their lives to protect their noble master"" simply doesn't hold. Apparently, your Romanian consultants were shallow at this one. I do not see Gypsies like that at all.Overall, flawed, but got the atmosphere right and the acting and dialog was decent, on occasion excellent : (Van Helsing at the dinner table: ""She suffered alright, we put a stick in her heart and cut off her head"", approximately quoted.

legendary director's last significant film,"This is the legendary director's last significant film, a beautifully cinematic, romantic adaptation of Stoker's seminal horror novel. The decision to have Dracula's first stop in London be a visit to the
city's new cinema viewing room seems hugely appropriate - since the movies would become the medium that would perpetuate the Count's image and deeds for the next hundred years. Gary Oldman is, of course, nothing short of spectacular in the lead role; in his early scenes with Harker, in the castle, his blood red gown and grotesque white hairdo are startling because they depart so drastically from the black cape and formal attire we have always seen this character wear in the other films. The movie is packed with such costume, lighting and special effect touches that create other-worldly, dazzling effects. Yet the script adheres faithfully to Stoker's creepy tale as the forces of good, led by Anthony Hopkins as Dr. VanHelsing, go about their pursuit of the evil Count. There is a feverish, operatic intensity running through the entire production - the same sort of thrilling, stylish editing and atmosphere Mr. Coppola brought to his ""Godfsther"" films and ""Apocalypse Now"" masterpieces. His movie stands head and shoulders above all other Dracula films, yet for some reason is generally under-rated and overshadowed by those two classics from the 70's.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Blood.,"Francis Ford Coppola is an amazing director worthy of the status he's been given by making some of the best movies of all time. Dracula is a very decent movie but not a classic, even though I simply adore Gary Oldman and love his simply amazing portrayal of Dracula in this film. A true joy to watch and never one to disappoint. His evil laugh during ""the baby scene"" is one for the history books....too evil for words. Chilling. It also has Keanu Reeves in it, my least favorite actor. Keanu can't act to save his life, and the only rational reason for his movie appearances (notice I didn't say performances) is the fact that he's a panty waist pushover that will never object to anything any director asks him to do which makes him more palatable as a casting choice, I suppose. I can't imagine anyone who would actually think he's a good or great actor. I respect Coppola but I have no idea what in the hell he was thinking when he cast this joke and at the same time displayed impeccable taste by casting Oldman. Without Keananu, I might like it a little better. At least his role is fairly minimal.I do enjoy watching this film very much and I even own it, but when I view it I'm simply waiting for Oldman to appear and display his talent. The guy is a chameleon with all of the different accents he has successfully portrayed over his years of playing villains and never falls below my high expectations, even in films that are mediocre. His Transylvanian accent is so thick that it's difficult to believe that he doesn't actually speak that way. Winona Ryder is satisfactory as Dracula's lover but she always reminds me of an upset little sister with her pouty expressions and melodrama. I will admit that there is quite an unusual amount of chemistry between her and Oldman here. Anthony Hopkins plays Van Helsing, the vampire hunter, and is amusing to watch and also does a fine job with his accent.I think the reason the film wasn't perfect other than the questionable casting choices is that it seems to take the road of style over substance. I feel it could have been perfect. The sets, costumes, and musical score are all great and the story progresses quite nicely but it seems absurd at times. Also, Coppola must've had a massive unrelenting erection while filming. The unneeded nudity and sexual provocative-ness of the female vampires seems a little silly sometimes. This very well could have been in Bram Stoker's book, which I have not read, and I could be entirely wrong but it seems to be a little much even though I truly love breasts. Some of the special effects are poor which is most likely a result of Coppolla's studio approaching bankruptcy during filming. Other than that the film has a great story and is filmed beautifully and is very enjoyable to watch. Overall, above average. I would love to see Gary get more starring roles. I'll get off his lap now, my dance is over.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Over-the-top but fun,"I don't think anyone's ever made an accurate adaptation of Bram Stoker's vampire novel, though this one comes close. Honestly, this Dracula (1992) feels more like a remake of the basic story of The Mummy (1932) in that the villain is a centuries old undead creature who has damned his own soul once he loses the woman he loves, and his main goal is to reunite and possess her reincarnation in the modern world.The film is hindered by poor supporting performances and downright silly moments. Keanu Reeves is shockingly bad as Johnathan Harker, making the oft-criticized David Manners in the 1931 version look like Laurence Olivier in comparison. Winona Ryder, Anthony Hopkins, and Sadie Frost have their share of both serviceable and cringe-worthy moments.I found the lack of subtlety in the handling of the story's themes of sexuality to be laughable. For example, I know Lucy's supposed to be more openly sexual and man-hungry, but when she started spitting out those ridiculous double entendres that only a sixth grader would giggle at, I could not help but think it was a little overboard.The film is saved from total mediocrity by the spooky atmosphere, its haunting and romantic musical score, and most of all, through Gary Oldman's performance as Dracula. He's not the evil creature from the novel, but he does succeed in being simultaneously threatening and sympathetic, no easy task.Once again, don't expect a perfect recreation of the novel, but it is an entertaining, if flawed, vampire film. I'd certainly watch it over the 1931 Browning version, and this is coming from someone who loves 1930s horror.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
What next? Himmler as a Salvation Army worker?,"I was hardly 13 when I first borrowed the book from my local library. Stoker's language is thoroughly Victorian but much better than that of a Henry James. But he does have the knack for building up the atmosphere for terror and horror. He is a master of that, not just in this classic but in short stories such as The Squaw and Judge's House. I will not be surprised if there is universal consensus that the book made a lasting impression on all those who read it. My first Dracula film was also around that time. It was the Lee/ Cushing classic 'Horror of Dracula' on one of the many re-run tours. That was an effectively terrifying film which can deprive a young lad of sleep for many nights, when just a rustling curtain on a moonless night makes you pee. The story was not exactly faithful to Stoker but the broad outline conformed. Most people know the story or would have read a synopsis elsewhere, so I will not get into that. It is not easy to translate that horror to screen, and to avoid getting cheap like the Elm Street folks. Sequels followed and several other versions appeared with different actors, but none came to close this one (Salem's Lot was a reasonably good rendition of the book but commercially available tapes and DVDs are severely edited).Then in 1992 Coppola made his 'Dracula'. Coppola's Dracula had the best visuals. I think no one can surpass this master film-maker for the sets of the castle, the use of visual signals, the final chase and so many other things. Take the scene where the masked horseman picks up Harker at the pass. That was one great scene. And then, when Harker enters the castle for the first time. Nice touches like the Count's letter signed 'D' (people don't write like that anymore, do they?), the doomed schooner, I can go on. All these make this film visually an intensely satisfying experience, at least for fans of classic horror like me. When I think of the ill-conceived and inconsistent story lines, and bad direction of recent films like Sixth Sense and The Others (let alone your teenager slasher films), I think this film stands out. To repeat, visually, this is the best Dracula ever made.Do I have any reservations about this movie? A big one, and posing as an influential critic for a moment, I will cut one full star, hold that, a star and a half, from five stars for that big reservation. Coppola, paying homage to the touchy-feely, post-modern and politically correct early 1990s, wants us to 'understand' Dracula. He humanizes the fellow. And that robs Dracula of his character; his entire character, and leaves the story an insipid, tame one. It is all the more disappointing because the opening sequences are so good that you hope to see more. I do not think I am giving away anything (I hope not).According to Coppola, Prince Vlad (Stoker based his Dracula on this ruthless Slavic prince) is a regular sort of chap. He is a defender of Christianity against the advancing Ottoman Turks. Some Turkish chicanery leads to his wife committing suicide (to be reincarnated as Minna in an English Household). Vlad (not yet 'Dracul' the 'vampyr') returns home and mourns. In his anger, he loses faith and desecrates the church; and of course, because of that becomes the undead. About two to three hundred years later, he realizes that his darling is growing up as Minna in London. He wants to be reunited. So the ruse for buying a house in London. He has no plans for a British green card or work permit. He just wants to get her and come back home to Transylvania. If he has to bite a few lasses on the way for sustenance, so be it. He is really not a bad guy you know!This is the cheesiest part of the movie's script, and it really damages an otherwise excellent film. Vlad was only an outline for Dracula. The character of Dracula derives from unmitigating evil. As Stoker tells us, he practised the arts of necromancy during his 'life', and was condemned to be the undead for all his deeds. The undead have no feelings of mercy. They only have feelings of pleasure and survival. Both derive from from eternal existence and blood sucking. It is hinted in the book that the Count has three consorts for sensual pleasures too. Until Harker gets rid of them! The Count wants to move to London because the locals in Transylvania are getting hostile, and London is a naively scientific place where he can go about unfettered and undiscovered. The Count goes after Minna in particular for revenge and for a replacement companion. Not because he always wanted her. That is the essence of Dracula. He is condemned to be the eternal undead until someone decides to liberate his soul. Till then, he will spread his evil because that is the only thing he knows, can think of and does. That is the vampire for you!Unfortunately, all this is lost in Coppola. I think he could have made an even better film without the cheesy concession to the post-modernists. Teenybop Romance has no place in a serious work like this. That said, casting is pretty good in this film. Gary Oldman is very good as the older Dracula. I am not so sure about his Slavic look with those dreadlocks. Keanu Reeves never looks reassuring to anyone, and he fits the role of the whining Harker very well. Anthony Hopkins does a good job as Van Helsing.All in all, I would recommend you watch this movie with minimal lighting and no interruptions. It is a decent movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the two best vampire movies of all time...,"With a beautiful cinematography, Coppola's awesome directing and incredible performances by Gary Oldman, Anthony Hopkins and Tom Waits, in a short but still incredible role, Dracula is one of my two favorite vampire movies of all time, along with Interview with The Vampire.

""Dracula"" seems to lose that gritty feel here. It's almost to artistic. The film also drags in some parts. And I was disappointed in how they handled Renfield.  The acting overall is great. Oldman shines, Hopkins is perfect & Ryder still lives on as one of the most underrated actress out there. The only mistake in the cast is Reeves. He seems so wooden that I was amazed saw dust didn't come out of him when the wives of Dracula had their way with him. There is one plus for all horror film fans. Unlike the two greatest ""Dracula"" films (""Nosferatu"" & 1931's ""Dracula.""). This ""Dracula"" has lots of blood. Just not in the way you might think. Overall a good film, 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Horrifically Inept,"Bram Stoker must be turning over in his grave. This horrifically inept adaptation of the famous novel earns the distinction of being the worst movie ever made by an Oscar-winning director. It is hard to believe that the man who gave us ""The Godfather"" is responsible for this travesty. Although the title suggests a faithfulness to the novel, the film takes liberties and none for the better. Although the cinematography is beautiful and there is a fine score, the plot is incoherent and quite tedious. Coppola adds gratuitous violence and gross scenes to make it look edgy, but fails miserably. Both Reeves and Ryder look out of place in this setting.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Camera Eye,"For some reason, very good movies do not catch my eye until much later. That may be because I have been in engrossed in so many movies made before the 1990's.I have seen Gary Oldman play Dracula several times and will see this horror flick again. The movie deserved the awards it received and I think one reason is the special effects. Not that it had many special effects, it did. Most people think of special effects as the visual eye candy, the behind-the-scenes manipulation and tricks that horror and sci-fi are noted for. Yet in Bram Stoker's Dracula, the camera itself must take credit for the chilling atmosphere and occult crafting found in the film's visual mastery. Screenplay is what I am actually referring to, and the screenplay is what makes the movie so strong in its intent to transfer a ghost story into reality.My prejudices in actors being what they always are, Anthony Hopkins is my candidate for the most credible supernatural expert on Nosferatu. It's interesting and possibly very unique that the actor plays the somewhat eccentric but intelligent physician but also a priest as well as a narrator. Van Helsing gives the movie what all dramatic movies what I call a wealth of humorous injection. Whether you or I give any credence to the occult or the supernatural, the circumstances surrounding the profound interplay between the living and undead, it is lighthearted to hear a doctor say ""I just want to cut off her head and put a stake through her heart"".",,Anonymous,Horror
A Sublime Gothic Romance,"My Rating : 7/10This one's a guilty pleasure. It's not perfect and it is indeed weak in a lot of places (Keanu Reeves' casting is fine, I don't like Anthony Hopkins' as a matter of fact) however I still enjoy it thanks to Gary Oldman's excellent take on Dracula.The visuals are undoubtedly wonderful and the overall texture of the film shines through the use of the background score, the use of the right hues of the colour red whether it is costumes or blood or symbolism.

"Keanu Reeves squanders a 10, Oldman is a 25","In my opinion, as with others, this film is a masterpiece. However Keanu Reeves, again in my opinion, almost completely destroys this film. Gary Oldman, undoubtedly, carries this film into utter perfection, in the realm of story telling. It's visual beauty and perfect angles make up for the one flaw in casting. Not to say this film is unwatchable, however one minor flaw in casting cannot, undoubtedly, take away from Gary Oldman's perfection of a performance. Worth the watch, bow down.

Not Stoker's,"This was definitely not Bram Stokers Dracula!! That said it was an enjoyable take on the Dracula story which, quite frankly, has been done to death. Gary Oldman is/was simply the best characterisation of the Count I have ever seen. I doubt he will ever be bettered. In all his incarnations young or old he really nails it. it is so true to the representation in the book as I remember it (if not the actual description it is the total feel of the character). it has been 30-40 years since I last read it and it scared the bejesus out of me! I really did not enjoy Hopkins in this - far too mannered and hammy for me. Keanu Reeves is pretty awful, mainly because of his accent. I think he was cast for box office reasons. I hated Sadie Frost when I first saw this and still don't love her after having seen it about 4 times, but she does grow on you - I guess she was doing as she was told by Coppola. Costumes were superb and the sets were great. There are a lot of flaws in the way the story was told and I would like to see a better, more coherent cut with as much of Gary Oldman as possible - he really should have won an Oscar for his towering performance in my opinion. The way he delivers his line ""The children of the night...."" is worth the cost of admission alone.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"The most faithful book adaptation with a shed load of artistic license, not entirely well executed","Only minor changes appear to have been made to the source material, with addition to linking Dracula to Vlad the Impaler, however there was a minor hint to that in the book, albeit a very vague link, subject to interpretation.On the whole it is a good film, however with one, rather two, distinctive flaws; Winona Ryder and Keanu Reaves.I've got nothing against their British accent, sort of received English, efforts, but all other aspects of their performances are truly dreadful. They didn't appear to give their characters any discernible life, seemingly chewing a the scenery, as opposed to offering any meaningful, captivating performance.I very much like Gary Oldman's Dracula performance in this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Any fan of the novel, or indeed cinema should definitely pass on this film.","Not only does this film bear only a slight resemblance to the novel of the same name, the movie is a terrible boor in and of itself. One wouldn't imagine a novel which has close to half a thousand pages and is a very satisfying read could be reduced to two hours and eight minutes of nothing. For the sake of those who may, to my dismay, desire to watch this movie I will not go into any great detail. However, turning each character into someone else on almost every occasion, as well as making some of them (perhaps unintentionally) sickly comedic was almost too much for me. I read the novel due to my love of vampiric lore, and forgetting about Dracula simply is not permissible. I was incredibly surprised by the power and wonder it held, as well as being extremely well written. I was very eager to watch this movie due to the fact that people have gone on and on about how it is the most faithful adaptation. I suppose if you compare it to the other movies which bear the name Dracula but have no resemblance, with the exception of a Romanian accent and blood sucking, that statement would be true, if not wildly inaccurate. I'm keeping this short so people will read it and not waste their time on this sad B-movie like interpretation of a wonderful novel.

WORTH REVISITING.,"Revisiting this film after many years, I noticed how well Coppola and cast injected humor into the proceedings. Creepy and gory with stunning art direction, special effects and grand score, this film deserves respect. Keanu? Well, he's Keanu. It's hard to remove the feeling of Harker's Excellent Adventure.

The greatest love-story of all time...,"...Adapted to the screen. Count Dracula defies and denies God, when his beloved throws herself in the river, after having heard false news of his death. Therefor he becomes a vampire, a damned creature forced to wander the night, sucking blood, praying on people... sorta like a nocturnal lawyer.So anyways, you know the story, let's not dwell in that. Let's talk about how Coppola made this film, one of the most beautiful at it's time, using great ambience and lightness in it's pictures. Many people think it's a horror-film, but compared to ""I know what you did last summer"", ""Scream"" and other abominations, Dracula is so elegant by comparasing.The story suffers a little from the adaption. There is a lot of so on and so forth, and many of the characters seem weakly drawn, and vague. Directors have to remember that NO we did not read that seven thousand page epic of a story, before entering the cinema. This is, at times, forgotten by the director of this film.But who cares? With Oldman, Hopkins, Ryder, Reeves and even Tom Waits, you tend to let the story slip out your mind, as you enjoy the violent, beautiful pictures, and the wonderful gothic score of Wojciech Kilar, ending with ""Lovesong for a Vampire"" by Annie Lennox, the greatest lovesong of all.You're gonna see this one, and you're gonna love it.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Yet this movie left me wanting more, but not in a good way.The cast was great, Oldmans Dracula was great. But the film itself left a disappointing taste in my mouth.The conclusion seemed half done, and the story left alot of questions. Mainly how exactly the count became the count.

Listen to them: the children of the night. What sweet music they make.,"I confess that having seen many Dracula movies, I only tuned into this to see Monica Belucci. I was not denied a beautiful treat in observing her bounteous charms, if only briefly. How could Keanu Reeves complain of being held captive by such beauty. But, I was in for an even greater treat to come.Gary Oldman is the ultimate Dracula. His performance was so fantastic that it will make you forget all others. Sir Anthony Hopkins was equally brilliant as Van Helsing.Of course, their great performances were barely noticeable when Sadie Frost was baring her milky white crumpets. She was fantastic! But, we mustn't dismiss the excellent performance of Wynona Ryder. She may have only given us a brief covered view of her bouncing beauties as she chased after her friend, but her acting was superb in all respects. To the best of my knowledge the Ryder cups have never been shown.

A Lot to Appreciate in this Movie,"In back to back years, Anthony Hopkins played a big role in the highest grossing horror movie of the year. His performance takes a backseat this time to the memorable performances of Gary Oldman and Winona Ryder. Oldman's Dracula performance is one that will forever be hard to beat. He's despicable and monstrous one minute and sincerely in love the next. This gothic horror creates a haunting atmosphere and the tragic love story is interesting to watch as it unfolds. It's a movie that will likely create complex feelings in its viewers. One can tell that a lot of passion and hard work went into this movie. The camera work, music and editing is very artistic.

It Grows...,"""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" is one of those films that absolutely *demands* repeat viewings to appreciate.  The first time I saw it I would have rated it a 4 or 5 maybe, but it has only 'grown on me' over the years.The movie never takes itself seriously, which may disappoint horror fans looking for 'the real deal', as suggested by the film's title and director. Truly corny/inane lines of dialogue are regularly followed by inspired passages, creating an engaging, quirky experience.One of the geniuses of this movie is the playing off of one of the world's worst actors (Keanu Reaves, in what has to be his flattest, most sophomoric and lifeless performance to date) against one of the best (Gary Oldman, who's obviously relishing this role) -- the contrast creates a fascinating film dynamic in which Reeves' character seems to almost disappear from the screen, while making Gary Oldman's acting (as Dracula) appear ten times better.  It almost seems as though the casting was planned that way -- anyway, it works well.Tom Waits (as Renfield) gives a real gem of a performance here... sadly, he gets very little screen time.  Winona Ryder is... well, Winona Ryder.  Her character works as Jonathan Harker's fiance, but not nearly as well as Dracula's 'love interest'.  Anthony Hopkins plays a darkly comic Van Helsing, yet another truly enjoyable performance.Some of the best scenes are toward the beginning of the film, in the castle. One really gets the impression of dark, squiggly things hiding in corners and terrifying secrets kept over centuries.  As always, Gary Oldman grabs and holds your attention, smoothing over plot sections that might start to stutter and drag in the hands of a less seasoned actor.It definitely takes repeated viewings to get to the point where you're really questioning (and understanding) what's happening there on the screen -- and when it finally clicks, the movie 'works' exceptionally well as a 'kitchen sink' horror/comedy/tragedy/romance.  In all likelihood, you won't enjoy it too much the first time (except for select performances), but reserve your judgment and try again a few months later.8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Overrated, but still watchable","After returning home to London, a lawyer finds that his friends' strange behavior is caused by a vampire count looking for a reincarnation of his lost love and sets out with a professional hunter to stop him before it's accomplishedWhen this one really tried to, it had some really nice stuff to it. The main to it is that there's some wonderful, individual scenes here, starting with a really creepy scene near the beginning where a man walks through a foggy, dark cemetery as he hears voices throughout and out-of-nowhere runs into a black-hooded figure holding a lantern in front of a horse-and-carriage, a prisoner strung-out dealing with the brides in a dried out, decaying pit in the castle basement and the action of being on the ship has a few really neat scenes. The longer ones are also worthwhile, with the main one being the appearance of the brides as it's not enough to have three women appear topless in elegant Gothic gowns but to do it from within a bed-sheet next to their target is impressive and adds a dream-like quality to the film. Also quite good are the scenes depicting the start of the transportation, which is represented with a series of really nice and impressive dream scenes that are at first merely flash cuts of horrific images before giving way to a tense chase through a maze and finally to a hairy creature feasting upon a blood-soaked victim. Even more impressive is that it leads to the scene of the creature's attacks in real life, watching an unknown beast claw through several guards in violent manner through its POV is really fun and enjoyable. The other part here that works are the fun, action-packed bookends to the film, with the opening on the battlefield and the castle-ground finale is pretty good while the ending assault at the castle itself is a highlight. These here are the film's good points as this here was pretty problematic at times. The biggest thing to this is the length, which is pretty big at two hours. This one is really epic yet only feels that way for reasons that have no bearing on why it should be. The first is that scenes tend to drag on forever that could've been shortened since they take too long to make their point. The most obvious one here is the first scene in the castle which manages to occupy twenty-minutes of time as Dracula rattles off several speeches about being in love that lasts for quite a longer time than it should have. As well, this one works for the fighting in the tavern as it's quite boring watching Dracula hurl people into furniture before making ominous threats. The other factor which brings out the length is the seeming multitude of scenes that are so useless they never needed to be there, like the two walking around London trying to win her over with his charms, the scenes of the two girls joking around at the party and the scene of them in the garden talking about the wedding. These are mostly responsible for the film's length here. The last flaw is the dearth of blood and gore amongst the body count, with this one really should've had more for as big as it is but it's not as detrimental as the other flaws. Otherwise, this one wasn't all that bad and had some good points to it.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Language, Brief Nudity and a sex scene.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Dark Romantic Tale,"I like ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" just the same as ""Interview With the Vampire"", because they are both different in their own way.  Anyway, about ""Dracula"", I kind of view it as a dark romantic film with a strange twist of horror.  This film is kind of like taking the romantic elements of a William Shakespeare tragedy (such as ""Romeo and Juliet"") and adding a big taste of something dark yet beautiful, somewhat like you'd read in an Anne Rice novel.

Also sexuality depicted here is masterpiece! Leads it to some next level. But yeah there are quite few things that could have lead the movie to even greater one. One of 'em is the casting.

One of my favorite movies.,"Although as a gothic inclined person, usually I try to avoid the stereotypical vampire ideas people have about the subculture but I must say that this is a darn good movie with a great 'gothic' feel and look to it.I'm half way though the book and it indeed it doesn't follow the original story that faithfully but still what we have here is a very good movie.The sets, the atmosphere and cast all are great. Even the much maligned role of Keanu Reeves doesn't strike me as annoying.The film definately isn't you're stereotypical horror flick. Instead it tells a very visual and hypnotic story filled with eroticism, romance and blood. It's not all that scary. It just tells a morbid and decadent story about a man who has basically lost all what he believed in and feels as if he gets a 2nd chance when he sees his lost love reincarnated in a simple woman.What we have here is a film about Dracula the man. Not the monster. Yes we see aspects of that but mostly we see the man. The count who has lived with grief and madness for so long.. I think this is an interesting view on the legend. We saw this side of vampires in Interview With The Vampire which is in my humble oppinion better and more epic but still as vampire films go this comes close.All in all I reccommend this highly. Very stylish. Tragedy, decadence, romance and eroticism. What could you want more?",,Anonymous,Horror

One of the Best Vampire Movies,"I thought it was a really exciting movie--as good as Blade (another vampire movie), and as good as The Mummy (which has a similar love story in it). Unlike the book, they actually show Dracula's motivation behind his actions. Otherwise, it's fairly accurate to the book (for a 2-hour movie), thought it's much better than the book--more understandable, more exciting, less long, better dialog. The costumes are beautiful, and they also fit the time period. The music is good, and also fits with the movie since it sounds dark, and some parts sound Transylvanian. Keanu Reeves is the only one that doesn't quite fit in--his British accent needs some work. But overall, a great movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Darkly Beautiful--But Sterile and Uninvolving,"Although it received generally positive reviews and proved a world-wide box office success, public reaction to the 1992 BRAM STOKER'S Dracula was significantly mixed. To a certain extent, this reaction was based on the film's slightly abstract, extremely operatic visual style--a style which seemed to overpower not only the actors but the actual story itself.Dracula has a spectacular visual design that mixes ideas about Victorian style with flamboyant color and ornate, border-line baroque detail that seems more suited to an Asian stage play than a film presumably set in 1890s England. The cinematography follows suit, using double and triple exposures, shared screen photography, and intense washes of color. The result is tremendously moody, both beautiful and ominous. It is also extremely distracting, and it tends to bury the actors, script, and story to such an extent that the film becomes less about these elements than about the mood and look inflicted upon them.At the time it was released, Dracula was touted as the first film version that was faithful to the 1897 novel by Bram Stoker--but this is not true, as any one who has read the novel can attest. The film has been deeply influenced by the Bela Lugosi film, the Boris Karloff THE MUMMY, and the ""Hammer Horror"" vampire films of the 1960s; it explains how Dracula became a vampire, incorporates dollops of reincarnation, includes a very romantic subplot, and presents us with an ultimately sexy vampire--none of which exist in Stoker's novel. There is also considerable sex, and while this is a part of the original novel its power there arises from its subtextual nature; here it is rendered explicit and consequently seems less powerful than merely commonplace. Even so, the core story of Dracula's transition from Transylvannia to England, his attacks on Lucy and Mina, and his ultimate destruction remains much the same.The casting of Gary Oldman as Dracula and Anthony Hopkins as Van Helsing was a stroke of genius, but sad to say the production-heavy nature of the film doesn't allow them the necessary wiggle-room necessary to create the memorable performances you would expect. Winona Ryder seems very aptly cast as Mina, as does Sadie Frost as Lucy--but the script undercuts both, leaving Mina slightly chilly and Lucy excessively overheated. As for the eternally wooden Keanu Reeves, he lives up to his reputation as one of the least interesting actors of the era, delivering a memorably wooden performance.When the film delivers, it does so memorably, with the scene in which Lucy is laid to rest for once and all a case in point. But overall, BRAM STOKER'S Dracula is not Bram Stoker, nor is it actually a cohesive variation: it simply a particularly exotic vision forced upon a story that doesn't support it. The result is often darkly beautiful, but it is also somewhat sterile and surprisingly uninvolving. The recent ""special edition"" DVD actually undercuts the visual interest of the film; the transfer is dreadful. If you are a fan who wants the bonus material--and there is a goodly amount of it--you would do best to hang onto your original DVD copy as well, for it will be superior to the version offered here.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"""The blood is the life... and it shall be mine.""","Francis Ford Coppola's sumptuous retelling of a story that, frankly, has been told to death. It's one of the more fresh and inventive versions of the Dracula story that has ever been filmed. That isn't to say it's without flaws (the limited acting abilities of Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder, for example) but it has a lot going for it that few cinematic Draculas do. The script reworks and expands upon Stoker's tale in some brilliant ways, adding depth to the Dracula character that is largely missing from the novel. Gary Oldman's performance is wonderfully theatrical without going too far into camp territory. It's one of Coppola's best post-70s films. Possibly the best, in my opinion. Of course it doesn't match up to his classics from that decade but it is far more memorable than most of his efforts since. The visuals in this movie are simply stunning. The colors, the sets, the costumes, the effects, the editing are all remarkable. Wojciech Kilar's evocative score is deserving of more praise.This isn't the scariest Dracula movie ever made but it is one of the more interesting. It may wallow in its excesses at times and it is probably a tad longer than necessary, but it's a gorgeous film with so much going on in every scene that I never felt bored or uninvolved.

Questionable mix of very interesting scenes,"First of all, I haven't read the book. This is a movie I watched in 2008. The first thing that comes to my mind when I think about this movie is ""great parts, doesn't hold too well as a whole"". Why is that?Great parts: there is no single scene I disliked in the whole movie; everything is presented in a rather pleasant, artistic way. There is no need to further describe why those scenes are so interesting, many have done it before.Questionable as a whole: when I watch a movie, what I am looking forward to is being told a decent story in an entertaining or at least interesting way. This movie was certainly entertaining and interesting.Was the story decent? I would almost be tempted to reply ""what story?"". I won't even bother to mention the aspects of the ""story"" I disliked or didn't understand. There is no reasonable character development and the transitions between scenes are so unclear. I ended up guessing what was happening, but the movie itself does not explain anything.For these reasons, I did not care about the characters and I didn't fully understand the motives behind their actions.May be the best way I can describe this movie is by saying ""a 2 hour-long trailer"".I'm thrilled, looking forward to a version of this that will explain what is happening.I gave this 7 out of 10. I could have given 8, or 6, this doesn't matter. I enjoyed it, but feel it could be so much deeper, because as others have mentioned here, each scene might carry some depth, but as a whole, it doesn't.On a final note, other words that come to my mind when I think about this movie are ""sadly empty"". ""Empty"" because there isn't a decent story and ""sadly"" because I really wish I could understand those amazing characters. Isn't it awful not to be able to feel compassion for the ones in pain?

Mutilated adaptation of a literary classic,"Well, what can one say about this butchering of a literary classic? It is not often that I feel compelled to comment on a movie, but in this case I couldn't stop myself. While the average movie goer who hasn't read the novel may find this movie to be entertaining (fair enough, as the acting and production values are all decent), anyone who has read the novel will be appalled. Now I don't believe a movie adaptation should follow its source verbatim, it should at least maintain its spirit and focus.Firstly, the focus. As many on here have already stated, the novel depicts the human struggle against the supernatural Dracula, the movie has invented a ""timeless"" love between Mina and Dracula. This is bad for two reasons, firstly it destroys the real timeless love between Jonathon Harker and Mina that was fundamental to the ultimate victory against Dracula. Secondly, it humanises Dracula and tries to excuse his fall into damnation because of love as well as inventing Mina as the reincarnation of Dracula's dead bride.Next, the characters have all been distorted beyond recognition. Lucy has been turned from a classy, lovely lady whom one could believe that three distinguished gentlemen such as John, Quincy and Arthur could all fall in love with, into a trollop and whore whom repels whenever she opens her mouth. Mina I have already mentioned, but when in the movie she openly volunteers to become a vampire and drink Dracula's blood, I wanted her to be slaughtered with him and get what she deserved (although I knew this wouldn't happen). The other characters, most notably John Seward have been stripped to bit part roles in order to support our timeless romance. If I was Harker, I would be getting a divorce quick smart.The ending of the movie was most painful. The hackneyed chase scene (understandable for entertainment purposes), Quincy's death was handled without the dignity the character deserved, the farcical redemption of Dracula with Mina at the end, I could go on. Don't remind me of the Vlad that Impaler introduction, it was cringeworthy.I could go on, but ultimately, this movie is only insulting to those who read and appreciated the novel. I didn't not give this movie a '1' as many detractors have, as the movie is far from unwatchable from a neutral viewpoint. It is by no means a masterpiece even then, as it was very overblown, especially the Dracula special effects. Personally, I couldn't wait for the movie to end and I will most definitely never watch this movie again.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Powerful,"This film is a good example that some stories can be re-vamped without loosing their touch.In the case of Dracula, a myth I never really cared much for, an old story has been taken and been transformed into a brilliant adventure which does, unlike most other vampire flicks, not only rely on horror effects, but does rather focus on the characters and their relationships. The mild erotic touch of this Dracula version adds to the new flavour of this film, and I have to confess that I was really stunned by the visual power Coppola was able to create. Finally, the actors played great, especially Hopkins as Abraham van Helsing, always on the brink of madness. Excellent!Though die-hard vampire fans probably cried out loud about this one, I think the average audience gets a total package here.

The special effects are astounding. It sticks to the original ""Dracula"" story, but portrays the count as a victim instead of a monster, it makes you think. I love it!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of my all time favorite movies.,"I can't tell you how much I love this movie. Gary Oldman (my favorite actor, no question) portrays the romantic, handsome Dracula that we would love to be bitten by.  I love his performance as the ""ancient"" Dracula, he conveys great wisdom and an aura of mystery in this role.  He really knows how to play the guy we all love to hate.  But in this role, I think you come away feeling sad and sorry that things turned out the way they did.Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Von Helsing is memorable as well, he plays the role with a touch of twisted humor and some dirty old man-ness.Great movie, if you haven't seen it, check it out. It's not a corny Dracula movie, its done with originality and genuine scariness.  A tragic love story.",,Anonymous,Horror
Extremely Funny,"Vampire films almost by definition are parodies, just as the Victorian-era vampire story is almost by definition a metaphor for repressed sexuality. These run from the obvious (""Fearless Vampire Killers""), to the subtle (""Van Helsing""), to the self-parody (""Bram Stoker's Dracula"").Coppola's ""Dracula"" is a lush high budget adaptation that bears only a slight resemblance to the Bram Stoker original story. That it takes a major liberty by adding bad history to make the title character sympathetic is forgivable, in part because it adds to the self-parody element and in part because this version still incorporates the enough elements of the original-if somewhat reinterpreted to better align with the sympathetic treatment.The parody elements begin early when Dracula declares war on God by pushing his sword into a stone cross which then begins to flood the room with blood (yes it is as silly as it sounds). At one point Coppola breaks the conventions of the genre and allows Dracula to walk around in daylight. Dracula's getup for this scene may have been the inspiration for Johnny Depp's Willy Wonka look. The warders in the insane asylum spend their on camera time spraying the patients with fire hoses, and they wear birdcages on their heads while performing this duty. Throughout the film, Coppola and his post-production people parody the overuse of ""match cut"" transitions (i.e. when a light in the current scene cross-dissolves into a fire in the next scene) by other filmmakers. They make almost all transitions into overreaching match cuts. This is all enormous fun to watch but not as much fun as the wild performances by the cast.Gary Oldman, Sadie Frost, Richard E. Grant, Tom Waits, and Anthony Hopkins all overplay their characters in a nice self-parodying way. They obviously are having a whole lot of fun playing this stuff for laughs. At one point Oldman gets to wear a makeup design that would work well in a Star Trek episode. But Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder act like Coppola forgot to let them in on the joke (unless everyone in the cast is happy because they are laughing at Reeves' lame attempt at a British accent). Reeves is too limited in the talent department to pull out an over-the-top self-parodying performance. Ryder's situation is a little different, her style and strength is playing all her roles as if they are real. Although this works nicely for things like her Veronica character in ""Heathers"", it leaves her at the mercy of the script. Here the Mina character just doesn't have enough complexity to justify Winona's efforts.Speaking of Winona, she has never looked more desirable than in this film and the same can be said for Sadie Frost. This is ample justification for male viewers to seek out this film. Ryder and Frost even manage a brief passionate kiss during a cloudburst.There is one wondrously nice sequence where the editor cuts back and forth between Lucy's last encounter with Dracula and Nina's wedding ceremony. It is really a slick bit of film magic and a nice illustration of the sexual nature of the whole vampire genre.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

This Dracula might look Spectacula - but it isn't an all time genre classic.,"Francis Ford Coppola and co pulled out all the stops in this faithful retelling of Bram Stoker's classic masterpiece about undead luvin', everything short of hiring quality young actors that is¬Ö The short version of the plot goes like this: When a renowned Transylvanian warrior finds that his much adored wife has taken her own life while he was out and about crusading on the Lord's behalf, Count Dracula he renounces the Church and gives himself eternal life just because of the passion of his speech! The now undead through sheer force of will Count potters about his vast castle, eating babies, growing and training minions and influencing beings of lesser intellect to do his bidding. Gee that was worth hanging around hundreds of years forThis all changes when his personal banker Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves) makes his wooden way across the seas to pay the Count a visit in order to have some documents signed and sealed. Unfortunately the last personal banker to make the journey went nuts shortly after and was confined to an asylum to eat bugs and alternately mutter under his breath and scream for his master at the top of his lungs, but still ‚Äì a promotion is a promotion, even if it takes you away from your loved ones.It is after the Count spies a pic of Harker's missus awaiting his return in jolly old London town that the situation changes. The Count firmly believes that Mina (Winona Ryder) is not only the spitting image of his once beloved dead some hundreds of years, but is in fact her. And he in turn is destined to be with her.So only after packing numerous ornate and resplendent outfits does the Count wend his way across seas to be with his destiny.Now I might've forgotten to mention but the Count is actually somewhat of a vampire ‚Äì not sure if he willed that part or if it was merely a side-effect. Nonetheless this grants him special powers, including but not limited to: shape-changing (bat/dog/wolfman/mist etc), brainwashing, fire-breathing and apparently flight.Once in the UK all Drac wants to do is hook up with his laydee, but once his presence is made clear it seems that all the women he comes into contact with are more than willing to disrobe for him, often in public, while all the guys want to ram a stake through his heart and cut off his head.(Coincidentally enough the same effect Matthew McConaughey has on the general public.) The star of Dracula is the production design. The sets are opulent and immaculate with the finest detail being obvious and Gothic themes and vivid creative imagery on display in almost every scene. The background is awash with vivid and lustrous colour and the costuming similarly intricate.On top of this there are numerous eye-catching elements including the oft-parodied and copied mismatched shadows, the overlapping backgrounds which morph into other scenes or subtly show subliminal imagery, and the special effects for the time are quite impressive.Gary Oldman fully vamps it up as the Count in his various incarnations, giving nothing less than 110% at all times in a role that demands cartoonish elements. Anthony Hopkins is no less over the top as Van Helsing, only perhaps in a role that doesn't require the same degree of hamminess. But both Reeves and Ryder find ways to average out the film with their wooden performances and stilted delivery. I do not pretend to know a great deal about the nuances of acting or the techniques required to lend credibility to a period drama ‚Äì I just know that whatever it is they didn't have it.Blood is a recurring motif in Dracula, for obvious reasons, and as the film progresses toward the inevitable much is shed, though in a Sleepy Hollow so violent that it can't be real way.In the 90s when I was far more impressionable it was all so easy to be swept up in the orgy of imagery and visual flourishes that Dracula provides, and to blindly see the over the top performances from Hopkins and Oldman as masterworks. Now 20 years on these things aren't quite so impressive, Dracula remains a very good film with an awful lot to look at and admire, but it is by no means an all time classic.Final Rating ‚Äì 7.5 / 10. Immaculate production and lush designs make Dracula spectacula, but still can't create the quintessential Vampire movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Definitive Dracula Experience,"If there's any Dracula film that could rival the Bela Legosi Dracula movie it is indeed this one. Gary Oldman's acting alone is enough to solidify this as the definitive Dracula experience. From the emotional performance he delivers in showcasing the start of the curse of Dracula from his origins when he was a soldier in a holy war to the then present day as he struggles to deal with his immortality until he comes across a girl who reminds him of his lost love restoring purpose in his undead life once more. Frank's Ford Coppola directing the movie too I felt helped a lot with capturing not only the fantastic performances from the likes of Oldman and Hopkins but also managed to encompass such great cinematography as well as gorgeous gothic set pieces. It was all beautifully rendered and masterfully shot from a seasoned director who was in his prime and knew his stuff. The costume design too was great. Using practical effects to show the horrors of Dracula's many forms from vampire bat to werewolf were all as captivating to behold as they were disturbing to witness and take in. And some of those werewolf scenes were downright hilarious as they were whacked out to get through. That one scene with him in werewolf form having a go at Lucy in the mausoleum place was downright borderline bestiality but hey it kept my interest as the bizarre and unusual will do that more often than not. Overall if you haven't seen this classic or have a dozen or more times like I have by now well, watch it or watch it again because it just keeps getting better with age. I keep finding new things in it to think about too the more I rewatch and so can you dear potential viewers.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

(almost) Bram Stoker's,"This is supposed to be the most exact adaptation of Bram Stoker's masterpiece, and there's no doubt that Coppola's ""Dracula"" has much more to do with the novel than Todd Browning's, Terence Fisher's, Murnau's, Herzog's, or any of the most remarkable films about the Nosferatu... I supposed it was Coppola's aim to do it that way. So, why did he make up that love-story between Dracula and Mina Harker? There's no such thing in the novel. Did he do that in order to make his film more commercial? Was it a Hollywood imposition? I assume that it is impossible to recreate chapter by chapter that great novel (they'd need to make a 5 or 6 hour long movie), but you can't add things to such a masterpiece. I mean, are you making an adaptation or are you not? Browning or Fisher didn't called their movies ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", because they knew their movies hadn't nothing to do with the novel; and I think Coppola's shouldn't have called his Dracula as Bram Stoker's.OK, once I've make clear that this is not an EXACT adaptation of the story let's talk about the movie itself: Coppola made an outstanding job with the technical part, the photography is just perfect, the colours, the shadows, the atmospheres, the special effects... The movie has such rhythm (except for those scenes that develop Dracula and Mina's lovestory, which are rather hackneyed and sickly), and they made a nice job with the script (Dracula is a novel based on diaries, letters, etc. so it was not easy to convert that into a cinema script). These are the good things about Coppola's adaptation. Now the bad things: again, that love story; the character of Van Helsing is much more rude and reckless than Stoker's creation (although Anthony Hopkins plays it in the best possible way); the characters of Quincey, Seward, and Goldmig aren't properly developed, also they failed to recreate the love and the friendship among those characters... and last, but not least, I don't like the work of Winona Ryder (her performance is such ridiculous in some scene such as that one beneath Dracula's castle) nor Keanu Reeves' (couldn't he be a little more expressionless???).PS: Maybe I'm being too harsh judging those things in relation to the novel adaptation (the characters, the mistakes...), but Dracula is one of my favourite novels ever, so I can't be very tolerant about it :D.My rate: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Gary Oldman was impressive as Dracula/Vlad from medieval ruler to white face with Princess Leia hair buns to man/bat/ape to Steampunk gent, so many impressive versions of the Count. The romance across time with Mina/Elisabeta (Winona Ryder) was a real Beauty and the Beast affair, well portrayed. The use of shadows and eyes to illustrate Dracula's control from afar was well imagined.

"Return of gothic horror, with big budget","When this film was new I was too young to see it but I saw the poster and it looked fascinating. Only a couple of years later I saw the movie on tv. It's the first Coppola film I've ever seen and also my first Dracula.Later, Coppola's Godfather movies and Apocalypse Now have become my huge favorites, and I've also seen a lot of Dracula movies along the years, so how does the 1992 film hold up today?Well, it's probably not Coppola's best but it actually is a very good in the horror and Dracula categories. It is a visually fantastic film which should please all the fans of anything ""gothic"" and victorian. The cast is good, but I must say that even though Gary Oldman is an excellent actor, there have been better Draculas than him. Also Keanu Reeves is a bit wooden Harker. Antony Hopkins is ok as Van Helsing but still not as memorable as Peter Cushing. But it is very difficult to make the best Dracula movie ever because there have been so many good ones before. So, even if the movie doesn't succeed in being the best in all aspects it is a triumph in visual style. And I think it was very influential for the whole generation; in the 90s if you were to interview a black-clad goth/metalhead teenager it's very likely they would name this movie as one of their favorites (alongside The Crow and Edward Scissorhands). The image of top-hat dracula with his nonsensical but cool blue glasses is iconic. I thought nothing could be as cool as that. But I never had money or courage to become as overtly gothic myself...The more time passes the more I think this fiolm is an unique because special effects like this aren't used anymore in blockbusters like this. Film like this couldn't happen anymore.Not the best Dracula film ever, but it's one of the best. Coppola has nothing to be ashamed of here.

The score captures the essence of classic horror films, maybe from the 1930s or 1940s, but I wouldn't know since I am not a connoisseur.

Oh, and did I also mention Keanu Reeves?

Immortal,"Of the many versions to date, I have found Coppola's to be the one that finally offers the dramatic aspect no other Dracula director's camera has been able to give us. I must say that I am flabbergasted by the main co-stars' choice, being that I deem both Keanu Reaves and Winona Ryder B-class actors in ever aspect of their so-called performances. Nevertheless, Coppola's direction, the score and Hopkins' presence in the movie, with a diabolic Sadie Frost have acted as a painter's ability to make use of unwanted blemishes on a canvas, at times hiding them with passionate and vibrant strokes.Now let's talk about Gary Oldman performance, which has literally disabled my ability to even flinch during the movie for how incredible it was. Those who read the novel know that the very first part of the story is probably the crucial one from both a suspense and description standpoint: Jonathan Harker's diary of his journey to Transylvania, the caleche's conductor,his first encounter with Count Dracula and supper at the castle. Oldman's demeanor, pace in his talk, attire portrays the noble and valiant man Vlad The Impaler really was, making us also turn as pale as he was in the movie for how credible he seemed. The entire movie was rich of scenes and good performances by the entire supporting cast until the end.In retrospective, after seeing the movie a few times, I feel as if the viewer enters a journey into a Klimt-like ensemble of colors and objects, from the Count's long cloak to the bed in which Harker gets devoured by the vampire's mistresses (The count himself is not the one who bites Harker as narrated in the book if you noticed). The costumes choice and creation have also made an instrumental contribution to the success of the movie and its ability to surpass all other Dracula's interpretations thus far. Coppola's knowledge of how to blend drama into an almost set-in-stone story like this one has been another lesson of how far his genius can reach.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Stylistically fulfilled and visually ambitious, albeit somewhat too mannered","Francis Ford Coppola's treatment of Bram Stoker's classic novel is one of the most stylistically fulfilled and visually ambitious films of all time in the horror genre. A testament to Coppola's vision and position at the time, fresh off of The Godfather Part III, Bram Stoker's Dracula was arguably the director's last fully successful film to date. With a title that suggests an increased faithfulness to the book, the picture opens with a handsome red-and-black colour palette which may not exactly transport you back to 15th-century Transylvania, but certainly immerses you in its romanticized spirit. You cannot help but be impressed by Coppola's craft and vision, even if the film's meticulousness, aesthetics and stylized (albeit enjoyable) performances do inevitably become distractions from the suspense and thrills you'd expect in a rendition of one of history's most renowned pieces of horror literature. Gary Oldman gives an immaculate performance in the title role. Like the bloodthirsty count himself, Oldman alternates between repelling and enthralling you. And there is technically adept supporting work from Winona Ryder as Dracula's love interest and Anthony Hopkins as Professor Van Helsing. What the film and the cast ultimately have in common is that neither of them really succeed in reaching your gut and making its large portions of eroticism and gore truly felt. For that, Bram Stoker's Dracula remains somewhat too mannered and distant.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

For everything else that went into it for comparison sake anyhow.Dracula himself as portrayed by the very talented Gary Oldman is the reason anyone watches this movie and I thought he did a very good job with the script he was given. Often the set seemed over populated with extra's though which caused nuisance to many of the scene's he was in which I didn't like.

I love Bram Stokers book and I have collected books about Vlad Tepes for 20+ years and while I long for a movie based on Vlad without a vampiric element, I really love Gary Oldman as Vlad/Dracula.Visually I like how dark the movie is, I like the setting for Dracula's castle and there is a general cold and foreboding energy all the way through the movie.The costumes are wonderful, Eiko Ishioka won an Oscar for her costume design for this movie and it was absolutely deserved. It's worth watching just to see them!The rest of the cast kind of overact. Keanu is Keanu and we all love him for that reason. Anthony Hopkins overdoes the role of Van Helsing, as does Sadie Frost. Winona, in my humble opinion, is one of the most beautiful women ever to be on film, while her accent leaves much to be desired, she does give a good performance and despite stories of she and Gary Oldman not getting along, their chemistry was wonderful.Watching as an adult it's lost the hold it had on me as a teenager hopelessly in love with Gary and his Prince Vlad, I find myself cringing through most of it but...oh the costumes!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Colorful, stylish adaptation","Bram Stoker's Dracula was a return to the original Stoker's text (a move away from those cheesy Hammer Drac films).  It tells the story of Count Dracula and Mina (a incarnate of Dracula's former lover) and their undying love for each other. This is a visually striking and arresting film - the design, costume and makeup is unforgettable (who could forget Dracula's queer hairdo...?). My only problem with the film - is the casting of both Mina and Jonathon Harker with both Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves respectively - I thought they were cast because they were the ""then"" hot young actors - but they both can't act their way out of a shoe box....  But Gary Oldman tries to ""somewhat break the typecast"" by being the subject of desire (even though he is the bad guy...).",,Anonymous,Horror
An Under Appreciated Masterpiece,"Francis Ford Coppola made Dracula into a film that I want to watch over and over again. The very distinct dramatic style created such an uncommon atmosphere that I found unmatched in any other film I've seen. I liked the addition of a prologue where Dracula loses Elizabeta, it makes it more reasonable that Count Dracula would fall in love with Mina just by seeing her face. It also strengthened the theme that love never dies, since Dracula had been waiting for her to return for hundreds of years. The fantastic cast was originally what drew me into watching it in the first place, and I'm glad I did because after watching it a second time it's become one of my favorite movies.My only criticism of the movie is that I found it confusing the first time I watched it, it wasn't entirely clear to me what was going on and who was who since Dracula can change appearances. It wasn't clear that the man who Mina ran into on the streets of London was the same person who was at the castle with Johnathan. Overall I really enjoyed this version of Dracula.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Happy B'day Dracula,"May 26, 1897, marks a pivotal moment in literary history: the publication of Bram Stoker's ""Dracula."" This gothic masterpiece not only redefined the horror genre but also forever transformed the vampire myth. Over a century later, Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 film adaptation, ""Bram Stoker's Dracula,"" breathes new life into this timeless tale, captivating audiences with its stunning visuals, passionate performances, and a fresh interpretation of the iconic characters.Coppola's film delves into the origins of Count Dracula, drawing inspiration from the historical figure Vlad the Impaler, a ruthless Wallachian prince known for his cruelty and penchant for impaling his enemies. Gary Oldman's mesmerizing portrayal of Dracula is both terrifying and seductive, capturing the character's complex duality as a monstrous predator and a tormented soul yearning for love.The film's visual aesthetic is a feast for the eyes, with lavish costumes, opulent sets, and breathtaking cinematography that transports viewers to the gothic world of Transylvania and Victorian England. Eiko Ishioka's Oscar-winning costume designs are particularly noteworthy, creating a visual language that seamlessly blends historical accuracy with fantastical elements.""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" is not just a horror film; it's a gothic romance that explores the themes of love, loss, obsession, and redemption. The film's central love story between Dracula and Mina Harker (played by Winona Ryder) is both tragic and passionate, adding an emotional depth to the narrative that goes beyond the typical vampire tropes.The film's supporting cast, including Anthony Hopkins as the eccentric vampire hunter Van Helsing, Keanu Reeves as the young solicitor Jonathan Harker, and Sadie Frost as the alluring Lucy Westenra, deliver compelling performances that further enrich the film's tapestry.While ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" stays true to the essence of the novel, it also takes creative liberties, adding new layers to the story and characters. For instance, the film explores the romantic connection between Dracula and Mina, suggesting that their love transcends time and death. This interpretation adds a poignant dimension to the story, making it more than just a battle between good and evil.Coppola's film is a visual and emotional tour de force that pays homage to Stoker's original vision while bringing a fresh perspective to the vampire myth. It's a film that will continue to captivate and enthrall audiences for years to come.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
For those of you that have read the book,"...the sexual content may shock you! Comparing the film to the novel, there's lots of sex, sex, sex. Not a bad movie, but the theme has been changed from ""good versus evil"" to a love story, so be warned. Keanu Reeves, as everyone knows, has all the talents of a block of wood, but try not to dwell on that. What everyone expects of a vampire movie, but not of Bram Stoker's Dracula, let's just put it that way, and don't watch it with your mother in the room. The prologue and romantic subplot give a history that wasn't outlined in the novel (ficticious fiction, you could say) and makes room for a rather unlikely match-up. It's obvious, however, that Coppola tried to remain true to the novel: the film utilises direct quotations and makes an effort to be told in article/diary form. When I first began watching the movie, I thought it was an impeccable interpretation, then, however, it began to veer somewhat off course. Don't let this discourage you from watching, just be prepared. There's an interesting twist on the Renfield character, but other than these diversions, there's nothing too far off from the story.

Luscious Dark Love Story,"This movie is hands down the best dracula movie ever made. The opening scene is just so powerful and epic. Every scene is just dripping with rich luscious detail which is made even more amazing given that there are no CGI or digital effects used (except for the blue flame and some of the green fog), it is also a filmmakers and cinamatographers movie. The costumes are iconic, and the multiple unique transformations of dracula by Gary Oldman is a tour de force. Amazing cast, and Keanu almost spoiled it, but the fact that he just gets the life sucked out of him and his hair turns grey is just comic relief. Ultimately it is a love story that crosses centuries and 'oceans of time'. I watch this movie every year around halloween, and love it every time.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A very near miss...,"A grave testimony to the importance of good acting even when all the other elements of a classic film are accounted for. ""Dracula"" 1992 comes damn close to having been the definitive screen realisation. It is, indeed, the only realisation to date which bothers to take a detailed, textured look at the Late Victorian period, which is richly detailed in the novel, and for that alone deserves commendation. The cinematography is lavish, and mostly very effective, although the lack of actual location filming becomes a mite conspicuous. Wojciech Kilar's score is even more effective, and generates most of the real emotion in the film, and here our problems begin...In spite of a first-rate cast, there are no real stand-out performances, though Gary Oldman just about manages to carry every scene he is in. This is just as well, as Winona Ryder acts the part of his beloved with a terrible lack of conviction. Keanu Reeves has come in for a lot of criticism, and although it ought to be said that the screenwriter's conception of Jonathan Harker - as a weak-willed wet blanket - does not exactly give him a gift of a role, his delivery of certain lines (especially those requiring anger) is so unbelievably artificial it is a wonder that no-one demanded re-takes. Anthony Hopkins fares a little better, but fights a losing battle with over-the-top lines. On the other hand, he is good in the quieter moments, and provides some welcome macabre humour. Aside from Gary Oldman, the best performances are provided by Richard E. Grant and Tom Waits, who have full license to camp it up as a morphine-addicted doctor and his deranged patient. These roles are not, however, anywhere near as prominent as the aforementioned, and the film is often at its best when the actors have their mouths firmly shut and we can enjoy the music, design, and gloriously simple yet surreal visual effects (there is, thankfully, hardly any use of CG) on their own merits.A cinematographic masterpiece, but - as drama - it veers from the acceptable (at best) to the banal (all too frequently). A gorgeous spectacle, nevertheless, but by no means an actors' film.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Slow but good movie,"Dracula is a horror movie directed by Francis Ford Coppola and stars Gary Oldman, Winona Ryder, Anthony Hopkins and Keanu Reeves.I have seen many draculla movies with different types of themes but when it's comes to Dracula based on the novel by Late Bram Stoker I to some extent liked the romantic theme in which the draculla himself falls in love and we saw a romantic side of draculla with the forever traits of bloodsucking, brutal and ruthless.The start of the movie is good and gives a glimpse of an interesting movie and to some extent the movie doesn't disappointments. Just like other draculla movie this movie is also very dark and slow, few viewers might get bore with the slow pace of the movie.Acting is good and Gary Oldman was the most influential character of the movie and had single handedly carried the movie on his shoulders. The movie has another talented cast but was simply outshone by Oldman. Winona Ryder looked cute and pretty and was impressive. Anthony Hopkins wasn't that great and somewhere looked lost, Keanu Reeves was average.Screenplay of the movie is slow infact very slow, the movie is so slow that by the time the movie reaches it's climax you'll start feeling that the movie had stopped, the climax of the movie is good but few viewers might get exhausted by the time the movie reaches it's climax due to it's slow speed.Overall the movie is good and is entertaining.

Melodrama with a capital 'M' darling,"Dracula's success rides on three things:1) The strength of Oldman's performance, which reaches almost superhuman depths. 2) The romantic re-telling of Stoker's classic story. 3) The lush, heady art direction which permeates the brain like an opium-induced stupor.The sexual intonations of Stoker's original plot are brought to the forefront here. Coppolla's film is more a bourgeois erotic fantasy with a supernatural backdrop, but it is so visually splendid that it is impossible not to be swept away with it.Of course it has it's flaws, the most notable being the unforgivable miscasting of Keanu Reeves as Jonathan, who doesn't seem to understand the words coming out of his mouth and acts as though he warped straight out of 'Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure'. His scenes are cringe-worthy. Winona Ryder, while not as bad, is similarly unconvincing with a British accent that would be tolerable only in an 8th grade school play.The other members of the cast are admirable. Oldman literally sucks the scenery dry and oscillates masterfully between ice cold malevolence and warm passionate tenderness. Hopkins is comedic camp as Professor Van Helsing. Sadie Frost is scintillatingly cheeky as the precocious Lucy. Tom Waits is hysterical as Renfield. And Monica Belucci's breasts are divinely inspired.A flawed classic.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Exalted, sumptuous, sensuous trompe l'oeil Dracula","Coppola's take on the Stoker idiom will compel you to watch again and again, as this film is so masterful and ingenious that even its flaws become attributes like the errors woven into fine Persian rugs. Oldman was born to play the ambivalent, eternal count, here sometimes depicted as a near-Eastern wise man. Coppola wryly uses the film as a quotation device for other fine tellings of Dracula, such as in the scenes in which Oldman as Dracula jack-in-the-boxes out of coffins (riffing on Max Schreck in ""Nosferatu""). The film's HIV metaphors work brilliantly, and Anthony Hopkins' occasionally off-kilter Van Helsing provides welcome comic relief. Keanu Reaves's performance as Jonathan Harker is dunderheaded enough to be oddly endearing. Michael Ballhaus's cinematography is an utter profusion of saturated colors with semiotic significance, and the old-style matte and optical special effects make CGI seem stagey, acerbic and bloodless by comparison. This may be the best art-directed film ever to come out of Hollywood, and Eiko Ishioka's costumes burn messages and motifs into the unconscious. Cary Elwes, Richard Grant, and Billy Campbell play an odd troika of unlike fellows who find thrilling common cause in fighting Dracula. Coppola features two fine debut turns from women whose performances seem larger than life: Sadie Frost as the vibrant but vulnerable Lucy, and Monica Bellucci as a lovely but fiendishly eroticized Dracula bride. Tom Waits stuns as Renfield. A resounding, enthusiastic and bombastic 10 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
vulnerable vampire,"What makes this version of Dracula so outstanding is the profound emptiness at the center of the vampire's heart. His many guises-- the werewolf, the bat, the beast-man, the toothy old man, the courtly suitor, etc.-- reveal the absence of any one true self. While skilled and seasoned by the passing of the centuries, Dracula lacks a center. In 1462, he looses his cardinal virtue by desecrating his own god (Christ), and so he comes to London (in 1892) attempting to fill the void in himself by finding the reincarnation of his lost love. Oldman's Dracula is both a master manipulator of character and circumstance, and, at the same time, a highly emotive and reactive persona. His thirst for blood does not come from some biological nuance (as is often peddled to us by the trendy, scientistic wave of the Blade-ish, neo-vampire garbage). It is the insatiable thirst for a past that he cannot retrieve, or better, a past that he has only this one chance to retrieve via Mina-Elizabeta. Thus, the irony of this version of Dracula is that if Dracula had actually been graced with Mina's hand in the end, he would have surely ceased to be a killer.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
the most faithful adaptation of the novel,"Bram Stoker's Dracula is most faithful to the original story and the only Dracula movie I'm aware of that takes notice of both the sexual tension of the Victorian era and the love story that Dracula presents. Dracula is a fine film that shows off the talents of all it's actors save one and the talent of Francis Ford Coppola.The one actor to screw up his character is Keanu Reeves. They made him look like he was from 1898 all right but he has trouble bringing his character to life. That comes as no surprise to me because I've always known that he is a marginal talent that has his looks to thank for his fame. He is really Ted in every movie. In The Matrix he was Hacker Ted, in Speed he was Cop Ted, in Point Break he was FBI Ted, and in Dracula he is Victorian Ted. The fact that Keanu sucks shouldn't distract you from the great performances of his fellow actors though. Gary Oldman is probably the most underrated actor ever. He is a master at accents and is a completely different character in every movie he's in. Oldman plays Dracula without a hint of camp and with all the emotion that the character demands. Anthony Hopkins is another talent that fills the screen with his good but a little over the top portrayal of Dr. Van Helsing. Winona Ryder, Sadie Frost, Richard E. Grant, Bruce Campbell, Cary Elwes, and even Tom Waits all turn in masterful acting jobs.The visual aspect of Dracula is it's greatest strength in my opinion. The spectacular sets really bring you into the story. The elaborate and beautiful costumes by Oscar winner Eiko Ishioka are incredible. The original score is quite moving and fits the scenes that it is in perfectly.Basically what I am trying to say here is that Dracula is the most well made vampire movie and the best told Dracula story ever. It is told lovingly by a director who is a master of his craft and a cast that relishes their roles. Except for Ted, er Keanu Reeves.Bottom Line: It really sucks that this film has not received the Special Edition DVD treatment yet, as the current DVD has no extras at all and not even a trailer. If you haven't seen it then rent it, see it, fall in love with it, and then wait for the Special Edition to come out. It will eventually.

A feast for the eyes.,"I read the book recently. It's very good. It did take me a while to stop reading every word without Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder narrating in my head. Their accents in this, as noted by John Grant are pretty atrocious, but get past that quickly and this really is a very enjoyable. Dracula, a medieval Romanian Prince/Warlord is thrown into despair after his bride commits suicide thinking him too to be dead. Believing her doomed for eternity for her act, he renounces god and embraces all that is dark and evil. As set ups go, it's pretty gripping. Dracula (Gary Oldman) looks great in his youthful battle armour. In fact he really steals the show throughout in the costume department. Centuries later in 19th century London, Dracula is still alive. He's not actually in London yet, that's pretty much his goal for the entire story, to move house, but Renfield (Tom Waits, what a voice), a fly consuming resident of the local asylum senses him. How you might ask. Well incase you've been living under a rock and didn't know... Dracula or Count Dracula to give him his full title, is a vampire! Renfield was to assist Dracula as his estate agent (I don't remember this from the book, but it works). His downfall leaves Jonathan Harker (Reeves) to be drafted in. He's to go to Transylvania to meet and help the Count with the move. To say his portrayal of the young English gent is wooden is an understatement, it's even worse than his fiance Mina (Ryder), who at least seems to be having some fun with it. It's certainly not lacking in style. The sets, the costume. Everything is painted with gothic fairytale menace. It's in every sense of the word, wonderful. The first glimpse of the vampiric legend is as spectacular as could be hoped. Pale skin, blood red robes and an improbable hairstyle in a cold hostile looking castle. It's not long before he sees a photo of Harkers fianc√© and spots the eerie resemblace to his lost bride. Harker doesn't know it yet (he's not the sharpest tool) but Dracula has plans for him. The cast fills out with a few extras, Mina's playful rich friend Lucy (Sadie Frost) and a host of her amorous suitors including Richard E. Grant and Cary Elwes. They're largely superfluous, other than Jack (Grant), a morphine loving doctor who runs the asylum hosting Renfield. Their stories are better fleshed out in the book, but here they're simple padding until we get back to the scenes with Dracula driving Harker mad, trapped in his castle, writing letters to Mina, that provide plenty of folklore exposition. Fun as it is, it could quickly decend into style over content, but Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins) helps. He arrives to help Lucy who's been bitten by our vampire. That said, maybe what makes this so watchable is the style. It really does look wonderful. Yes some of the FX are a bit 90s, but they fit perfectly. Don't get me wrong, the bizarre love triangle with Dracula inserting himself into Harker's & Mina's life is fun, but not as much as the titans Hopkins & Oldham going head to head in their roles of good and evil. It's pretty faithful to the text, but stands on its own for its pure visual strength. Overblown, it's everything it should be.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Hart's arguments to the contrary, this film certainly doesn't accurately convey the contents of the book, which he seemed to view only as a treatise about repressed female sexuality in the Victorian period.  With that in mind, one shouldn't be surprised to see that the filmmakers chose to treat the film primarily as a romance and not a horror story.  However, there is still much to satisfy hardcore fans of the genre here.  This is a visually-impressive film with a somewhat surreal story-book quality.  Gary Oldham is quite impressive as Dracula. He handles the count's various forms and incarnations with aplomb.  Anthony Hopkins is also fun to watch as doctor Van Helsing.

I found it to have a rather poor production value and a weak ending. It does however posses some good qualities like a great score by Wojciech Kilar( a name suspiciously similar to my college professor's:) and of course Gary Oldman. His role as Dracula is almost legendary and rightfully so because his over-the-top performance fits the movie perfectly and is one of those roles that no other actor could have done half as good(like Brando's Godfather, Denzel's Training Day, Sellers Pink Panther, McDowell's A Clockwork Orange, Spacey's The Usual Suspects, etc) But the rest of the cast is more or less miserable and Keanu should thank his lucky stars for ever acting in another movie after this one.

At a bit of a loss.,"How to put this, some parts to this movie were incredibly good, while others plain stank. Shall I be positive and start with the good? Yes. From the very flashback beginning, (I have a personal affection for movies with flashbacks) I was captivated, and when seeing the mad who was he again in his cell, rising from the ground all surreal I was practically jumping up and down with excitement. Then came the blow. Keanu Reeves has got to be one of the most overrated actors out there, him and Arnold Shwartznager (sorry if I killed that because I always call him `Shwartzy'). Not only was his face a stone in this movie, like in any other, but his forced, horrible British accent just plain¬Ö well, come one now, even I could do a British accent better (and I am not saying I am any good at it)! All the other actors were marvelous, especially I enjoyed Hopkins and Ryder. A lot of the art was wonderful in it also such as all the scenes with the Vampire brides and the flowing gowns in the night. Some, however, were rather cheesy such as blood coming from both sides of the screen and green smoke¬ÖI mean, this just kills the mystical experience of the movie when you have special effects such as that. It makes it feel like some sort of cheep horror flick, and not a good one. The constant show of red blood cells also was a bit too technical and unmystical to be shown, I thought. What should have been done was to have the blood trickle like little snaky rivers over and around things (much more subtle that way), and the smoke to be black rather then that pop green. Perhaps subtleties was another good word to use, the movie lacked it. I would have preferred it more of a drama and less of horror such as Interview With The Vampire. Dracula himself was often portrayed a bit too obviously scary, it would have been better, I thought, had he looked more normal yet had some subtle chilly notes about him. The moving by itself carriage and all such was also a bit too `evil witch of the west'ish. So while some parts of the movie I thought to be exquisite, others I just had to shake my head at.

An Honest Review,"I like to read through everyone's reviews before I actually write my own. Get a feel for what they liked and didn't. Especially what they didn't like. It tells you a lot about the world.With new movies, if a certain age group hates on how boring it is, that means there is an abundance of story and characterization. It usually means that it is a pretty good flick.Dracula isn't one of those movies, the haters are coming from a totally opposite direction.This is one of those movies that the people hate because it wasn't exactly 100% like the books. To me that's boasting, it's saying ""Look I'm literate!"" It's a movie. It's the reason ""Catch-22"" fails when you turn it into a play, the formatting is too different, the time constraints too much and what works in books doesn't work in film.I used to work in history and the same thing goes there, in fact a lot more in history. I don't understand those arguments at all.Like the people that think they are being hip when they attack high school teachers for not teaching the REAL history. Teachers have 45 minutes a day for a few months to fit in 400 years in the US and 5,000 in world history.It's not propaganda, it's not lies, it's abridgement based on time and format.Who cares if it doesn't completely follow the book? You want the book, read the book.Dracula was great.For starters the soundtrack was moving. It was beautiful. It was sublime. It was brilliant. It was all the words for genius you can think of.And for those of you that like special effects, Dracula was surreal and not CGI. I've always thought that movies that did as much as possible in camera looked better, more real and Dracula, well, it doesn't look necessarily more relativistic but more like nightmare dream. Again, beautiful.And the cast. Legend has it that it was Ryder's dream cast. Gary Oldman, Anthony Hopkins, Richard E. Grant, Cary Elwes, Billy Campbell and Keanu Reeves is the only weak link in that chain...but that isn't really Keanu's fault.The fact is Mr. Reeves was just too Gen-X to be in a period film. The man looks, talks, and acts like he's from my Generation and they through him in Victorian England? Really? It's not that he did a bad job, it's just that he looked out of place the entire time. Ryder is Gen-X too, but she has a look that can transcend that.If they updated the film, made it in the 90s, and threw Harker in a flannel, some torn jeans and a pair of Doc Martins then people would be raving about how great of a job he did. How much he looked the part.As it stands he was distracting. Not because he didn't do a good job but because it's just impossible for him to look Victorian and really pull it off.And then back to the haters. ""Dracula"" was written in an epistolary format, can someone explain to me how a script is going to stay true to that? Yes, let's narrate ALL of the film? Let's sit people down in front of a camera and let them read news clippings and journals to the audience? Yeah, there is going to be some heave abridgement there. The script did a great job of making the story interesting for the silver screen.Hollywood is way out over there and real life and source material are right here. If the two merge too much than Hollywood would cease to be entertaining.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Style over substance,"The career of Francis Ford Coppola is a remarkable one. Making blockbuster after blockbuster from 1972 to 1979 (""The Godfather"" (1972), ""The Godfather Part 2"" (1974), ""The conversation"" (1974) and ""Apocalypse now"" (1979)) his films before and after were considerably less well received. These less well received films included ""The Godfather Part 3"" (1990) and ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" (1992).The prefix ""Bram Stoker's"" suggests that the film is (more) faithful to the novel (than other Dracula's adaptations). In reality it is above all a copyright issue.Unlike the book the opening of the film recounts why Dracula became Dracula. In so doing the film tries to build a little bit understanding for this character in stead of portraying it as 100% evil. It didn''t work for me.Another aspect of the film is that it puts style squarely over substance. The set pieces are sometimes amazing, but the story is a little empty. The performance of some of the well known actors was highly criticized, but the question is if this was not partly due to the shallow character they had to play.The eroticism which was rather hidden in ""Nosferatu"" (1922, Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau) and came somewhat more to the surface in ""Dracula"" (1958, Terence Fisher) turns into fairly explicit sex scenes in ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"". Of course this is a matter of taste, but I prefer a little more suggestion.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Wonderful Gothic Vampire Love Story,"Dracula(Gary Oldman) has captured a young lawyer Jonathan Harker(Keanu Reeves) in his castle to be his slave and to satisfy Satan's whores. Dracula's old love Elisabeta(Winona Ryder) turns out to be Mina, Jonathan's fiance. Now Dracula travels to England to find his lost love and spend forever with her. I thought this was a wonderful gothic vampire love story. I loved the way it was filmed, and the costumes and makeup were fantastic and often frightening. The acting was amazing, especially by Gary Oldman, Winona Ryder and Anthony Hopkins who played Professor Abraham Van Helsing. I would give Dracula 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dracula is the last landmark film of Coppola's career,"Francis Ford Coppola was scolded more in the last years of his career. Nevertheless, he passed his career peak by the beginning of the 1990s. Dracula is the last landmark film of his career. Great cast. Both recognized meters and only novice actors (Keanu Reeves is even aging?). Yes, the plot is surreal, the film is clearly shot in the wrong genre. If he were darker and closer to t would have turned out better, especially since Coppola had Hopkins and Oldman. And so it turned out a surreal drama.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Coppola's pastiche.,"I see that IMDb calls this movie *Dracula*. In my day, it was known as *BRAM STOKER'S Dracula*. Perhaps Stoker's estate litigated at some point during the past 13 years? -- for this movie certainly isn't Bram Stoker's *Dracula*. It is entirely Francis Ford Coppola's *Dracula*. I mean, I commend Coppola on assigning the correct names to the two main heroines (Mina Murray and Lucy Westenra), which, in the history of film adaptations of this novel, is oddly a first . . . but come on! No adaptation in which the Count is the main character can rightly be called *Bram Stoker's Dracula*.I also don't recall the scene in the book where Dracula appears in a red satin long-trained kimono. Between that attire, the white grease-paint on the face, and the ornate hairdo that includes a complicated braid topped off with what can only be described as a derri√®re-shaped basket on Gary Oldman's skull, this Dracula resembles nothing so much as an aging geisha. (Ill-advisedly, Coppola hired a Japanese costumer named Eiko Ishioka to handle the wardrobe. The story takes place in TRANSYLVANIA and ENGLAND, Francis!) Without belaboring the plot's particularities, let it be said that Coppola basically takes the easy way out and turns the thing into a Harlequin romance. ""I've crossed oceans of time to find you,"" murmurs our Undead hero, as he gazes into the vacuity of Winona Ryder's eyes.The movie DOES start out promisingly. We get some back-story on the vampire: Coppola and the film's writers go Stoker one step further and explicitly conflate the fictional Count with the Middle Ages ruler Vlad Tepes (""The Impaler""), who terrorized much of eastern Europe in the 15th century. (Strangely, Stoker had sort of dodged Dracula's ""true"" identity in the novel.) Coppola and cameraman Michael Ballhaus have great fun with the mise-en-scene for the prologue sequence: silhouetted soldiers, moving stiffly in a deliberately stylized way, spear one another in the foreground of a hellish red sunset. Later in the movie, Coppola will reference this bit again at a ""cinematograph"", in which the dark soldiers -- appearing on the screens presumably because Dracula happens to be there -- become like little marionettes ineptly trying to stab each other. The visual motif here is obviously an homage to a famous bit in Dreyer's *Vampyr*. Neat-o. But this sort of thing ends up being the main problem with the movie: much of the visual references are inside jokes appealing mainly to cinephiles (there is, for instance, a torch-holder on a wall in Drac's castle that is shaped like a human arm, a la Cocteau's *Beauty and the Beast*). Almost every scene ends in a silent-era style ""iris dissolve"". The lurid color-palette is an homage to the look of the old Hammer Studio horror films. All the heavy feminine panting and moaning would fit just as well in a Dario Argento movie. The true buff will also notice the photographic similarities to John Boorman's visually sublime *Exorcist II: The Heretic*, particularly during the climax when the heroes race against the sunset to catch up with Dracula. I mean, so on and so forth, for more than 2 hours. However, what the average horror fan -- or Dracula fan -- will get out of all this remains unclear.In any case, Coppola isn't content with merely referencing film-work from the past; he feels he must OUTDO them, pointlessly laying on the undiluted fruit-punch blood (smite a stone cross with a sword in this movie, and the stone gushes blood), the hallucinogenic phantasmagoria, the overall hysteria. The movie is all spectacle -- no scares.One can't finish a review of this movie without mentioning the acting. Gary Oldman is in Method Mode, over-earnestly delivering his tone-perfect Romanian accent. He sounds as if his mouth is full of marbles -- he is, for the most part, incomprehensible. Others here have mentioned the inadequacy of Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves -- wait till you hear Reeves say the phrase ""If I may inquire . . ."", or, even better, the place-name ""Bukovina"" (!) in a ""British"" accent. PRICELESS. The worst of the bunch, however, is Anthony Hopkins, but this is probably because the writers tried to make Van Helsing a funny character. Didn't work, guys.3 stars out of 10, primarily for not being boring.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Definitely not Bram Stoker's Dracula,"Don't be fooled by the title of this film.  It claims to be the definitive Dracula, but it is very far removed from the original novel's tone and style.  Sure, the characters have the same names and the plot is mostly the same, but the crucial mistake the screenwriter made was trying to turn this horror thriller into a love story.  The result is grotesque and absolutely off-putting.  Instead of being wickedly seductive and menacing, this Dracula is a whiner, constantly bawling about his lost love and staring at her pathetically with a hangdog expression.  Maybe this would have worked, if Mina had not reciprocated (heaven knows why) the monster's feelings.  Then his lust for her  would truly have been terrifying, because he would want to turn her into a vampire against her will.  But this Dracula swears he will never harm her, which immediately and proposterously takes all the menace out of the film.  Unlike the novel, none of the characters in the film is sympathetic, except THE WRONG ONE (ie the villain)! Why don't they just all get on with it and die in the mass orgy the director seems to think they want?  Jonathan is a stiff, Seward is himself a psychotic, Van Helsing is a pervert and Quincey and Arthur's roles are almost non-existent.  And this film perversely propagates a stereotype of women that is stuck in some chauvinist's wet dream.  From the start, which does not fit in at all with a Victorian sensibility, Mina and Lucy act like two libidinous nymphomaniacs just waiting to burst out of their corsets, as if women are just all hanging around, waiting for some wierd wolf-monster to ""liberate"" them. Everything about this film is excessive, over the top and absurd: the acting, the special effects, the cinematogrophy.  I guess there'll never be a film true to the novel, since this film doesn't reference the novel, but the hundreds of vampire films that have gone before it.  If you want to groan as another character screams maniacally (oh, I forgot, this is the measure of good acting these days) or laugh at a supposed romantic moment, then by all means, watch this film, excruciating for all the wrong reasons.  2 out of 5.",,Anonymous,Horror
Bloody and Lavish,"I love this film. I recognize that there are some supremely hammy parts but the truth is that they didn't bother me.   Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves are woefully miscast and their performances (and accents) are as bad as expected but the super lusty Sadie Frost as Lucy is a true over the top gem and Anthony Hopkins brings life and humor to the Van Helsing character.What is great about this film is its visual lushness, the tension building score and the melodrama.  I enjoyed that the count's past was explored and the timeless romantic connection between he and Mina was interesting.   Some people have a difficult time with Gary Oldman in the role of the vampire (it's probably the hot cross bun hairdo) but Oldman brings a sensual intensity to everything he does and he gives a unique and passionate portrayal of the lovesick count.Dracula's renouncing of god, Harker's seduction by the brides, Lucy's being ravished by the count/wolf and the chase to beat the sunrise are all great scenes that I could watch again and again.Adding Bram Stoker's name to the title was probably done in an effort to distinguish this Dracula film from the numerous other versions.  It could just as easily have been called Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula.  It is no more faithful to the novel than other versions have been and there's nothing wrong with that considering how lackluster the book is.Coppola's version is not as scary as the original Nosferatu, not as poetic as Werner Herzog's remake and not as enduring as the Bela Lugosi version but it is arguably more entertaining than all of them put together.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A masterpiece of cinema...,"My jaw dropped when I read some of these reviews of Dracula (1992). It seems the things people attack in it are things they do not have a background in. The medieval warfare plot is present in the film, because Vlad Dracula was a very real prince in the 15th century Wallachian state bordering Transylvania. In fact, the opening scene is depicted action for action with what happened historically, save for the blood gushing from the cross of course. Bram Stoker drew upon this historical character to drive his novel, for all the baggage such a figure would bring to the plate. As for the rest of the film, the look and style is very rooted in the Symbolist style of the period. In fact, many, many images in the film directly copy well-known Symbolist paintings to a tee. When the dreamy Symbolist style was not being employed, previous incarnations of Dracula on film are referenced. The independent shadow you mention was used in the first Dracula film, Nosferatu (1922). The special-effects employed were all limited to what was available to filmmaking at the time the novel takes place, using puppets, scrims, double-processing, et cetera.The use of absinthe and filmmaking (two great diversions of Stoker's day), were employed to draw up a parallel between themselves and vampirism. I am not going to go into detail how filmmaking parallels it here, but if you are wondering, go watch Shadow of the Vampire for a detailed example. Absinthe drew many under its dreamlike catatonic spell, and as a result of its potency at the time, destroyed many lives, despite its allure. Bram Stoker's Dracula is one of the greatest artistic accomplishments to come out of Hollywood, and I think, the most beautiful. The stagey acting style mimics the many stage adaptations, as well as the fevered sense of the novel. Add to that the most beautiful costumes, wonderful makeup design, what is perhaps the greatest musical score in cinema history, and it all adds up to be a masterpiece. I think if you want to explore more about the reasons for certain elements, your best route would be to pick up a copy of the book, Dracula: The Film and Legend, which chronicles many of the choices made for this adaptation.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not as crap as I remember!,"When I saw this way back when it was released, I thought it was terrible and couldn't understand why everyone rated it so much.For years, my go to diss of a film has been to say ""drak-huel-yah"".I'd always thought it was bad because of the accents of Keanu and, to a much lesser extent, Winona, but I have to say, that's not it.I thought at the time that despite Gary Oldman being WAY too old for Winona, he was the victim in it all and was poorly maligned. That still stands.He gives a stellar (when doesn't he?) performance, and in my old age I appreciate the campness of it all.But it's too loud, the age gap is still too much, and I'm still not convinced about all the awards. As for the accents, I like it that stuff is being made now without the need for pretending to have some fake accents to fit in with the story/location. Who knew Sean Connery was right all along?

Stylistically very good; plot drags on for too Long,"Coppola's take on Dracula, which stresses the name of the author in the title eventhough the plot is much different from Stoker's book, is stylistically excellent, especially the first part.The acting us good, but in a somewhat old-fashioned very dramatic style; this leads up to the next point and the biggest flaw: the plot.The plot turns into an ultra dramatic, one might perhaps say Shakespeare like, love story that drags on for a very long time at the end.

"Beautiful, Romantic Interpretation of Bram Stoker","Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves) is an Englishman and a real estate agent who has procured some land for his client, Count Dracula of Romania (Gary Oldman). But the Count (who, as the audience knows, is really a bloodthirsty vampire) has his sights set not only on land but also Harker's fianc√©, Mina (Winona Ryder). Rounding out the cast is Anthony Hopkins as VanHelsing, Cary Elwes as a suitor to Mina's friend Lucy, and Tom Waits as the psychotic Renfield.This is an astoundingly amazing film. It's told in such an epic fashion, and I really wish they had made the movie longer. Hopkins as VanHelsing is as good or better than any Peter Cushing interpretation (this VanHelsing is darkly comic, which works great). More of the story could have been told or secondary characters may have been developed more. The Texan, for example, seems incredibly out of place and could have used some background... and Hopkins doesn't enter the movie until the second half.The deviation from the book is slight in some places and greater in others. For the most part, the diary entries were kept to move the plot along, which pleases me greatly. But there also seems to be an unusual obsession with making this a romance, which is somewhat unnecessary. There are romantic elements in the book (and my high school English teacher always stressed the symbolism of penetration in ""Dracula""), but it goes to a new level in the film that seems designed to draw in a wider audience. Whether this is good or bad, I'm not entirely sure.The special effects deserve praise. Compared to today (2008), I found the effects here far more convincing. The shadows that have their own minds, the count's transformations (powered by Oldman, the best actor in Hollywood today) and more. Other films of the era (most notably ""Jurassic Park"") also pushed the limits of effects for the time, but ""Dracula"" shouldn't be under-rated in this department. Many today could take a lesson from this playbook.I made a bigger deal of the cast in my plot summary than usual, but this is with good reason: the casting of this film is highly peculiar, and even more peculiar is how successful the combination of actors comes across. Keanu Reeves is not known as a great leading man, still fresh from ""Bill and Ted"", but he does a decent enough job here. Winona Ryder is also somewhat of a lightweight, but pulls it off. But, countering this, Hopkins is amazing (as already noted), Oldman is the most perfect character actor for villains... and who would have thought to consider Tom Waits as a madman? It seems so obvious once you think about it.I watched this film on a DVD I purchased from a chain store for five bucks. It was worth this much and more. I am not aware if a special edition exists, but with this film's great cast, awesome plots, awards won and wide appeal, a good edition should. There is very little that could make the actual film better, but a solid audio commentary, 20-year retrospective and any deleted scenes would really provide the consumer with a worthwhile package.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Dracula makes it to where Ryder is and attempts to win her over.  Meanwhile, Reeves makes his escape.

About the misunderstanding in the Adaptation of a Book,"Is incredible to see how many people thinks about Dracula just like a Horror movie, I my opinion is more a Romance Film than a Horror movie. I have read the book, and is really disapointing if you have see the movie before. The narrative plot of the movie is a lot better than the used in the book. The make-up and Costumes of Gary Oldman are really outstanding, and the performances are amazing. If you want to get really scared go and see The Shining or Psycho, but If you want to see a Goth Romance movie, then Coppola's Dracula is for you. I'm really shocked with a review telling Keanu Reeves best perfomances are done in SPEED (?) and Matrix (maybe), have you ever seen A Walk in The Clouds or Devil's Advocate??? Speed is a wasting-time movie, a typical action movie, but this performance in Dracula has all the elements for a very good performance. Dracula is more than an Adaptation, is more than a Horror movie, is a conception about the Legend and the romantic implications of it, and Coppola (agains) do it at his best.

"""See What Your God Has Done To Me""","Well everybody knows Dracula or at least thinks they do. In reality most film portrayals emphasize the gory blood-lust horror aspects of the character, excluding everything else. These stereo-types probably do for Dracula what ""Jaws"" did for the white shark. Bram Stoker intended his novel to be a Gothic Romance. Although Francis Coppola does not stick faithfully to the novel, his film is probably the closest so far.The performances are uneven at times, but are overall quite good. Coppola gathered some fine actors together with Gary Oldman in the title role, Oldman gave the role his own touch, especially his Bela Lugosi imitated accent. There were arguments with Coppola over some the star's renditions of Dracula's personality. Oldman won out, the proof is in the final cut, a fantastic performance. Anthony Hopkins plays a rather more eccentric Professor Abraham Van Helsing and plays it as if the part was made for him. Sadie Frost's portrayal of the extroverted Lucy was the best performance of this character Which I have seen to date, While Keanu Reeves came over as a wimpish Jonathan Harker, which by Stoker's description, he was not, No fault of Reeves, but rather a directorial error.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Coppola's take isn't great, but it's still very good...","Francis Ford Coppola's adaptation of Bram Stoker's classic can be considered better than some of the lower ones in the genre due to a few key factors. 1) a mostly stellar cast (Oldman and Hopkins fit into their roles splendidly, Ryder does what she can, Reeves isn't too bad, and great supporting work from Elwes, Waits, and Grant) that does well by Coppola's always keen, if not exceptional, direction of actors. 2) Oscar winning effects and make-up, and a genuine look to the period. To see many of the sets and designs is to be reminded of how good big budgets can do for the story. Michael Ballhaus is also an essential asset. And 3) the take on the Dracula story (while I can't confirm since I've never read the book) seems to take a solid, novelistic approach. While Coppola does give in to some excesses with some of the music and the editing, and some of the romantic stuff in the film is less than great, the film is worthy for fans of the book and genre.

A second watch,"Now, first time I saw this film, I was on a date with a huge vampire fan, gothy-girl. Holy cow, the lines were long! We waited for like two hour, got to the window and were told, ""sorry, all showing tonight are sold out"".She really wanted to see, so we trekked across town to the other googleplex theater, waited another couple hours and got tickets to the midnight showing. By this time, I was thinking, ""this better be a great 'censored' movie"", but it was witching hour, and we were getting to see the much hyped movie.Well, it was fairly cheesy with the fade ins and fade outs and artsy fartsy, love story, roses superimposed in the background, lovey dovey ilk. I could have puked! There was some cool special effects, the atmosphere was ruined by the 'trying to hard' cinematography, stealing classic film trickery from old movies like Citizen Kane, and not to mention being like 3 hours long.I have an attention span of like 1/2 hour, so I have to watch movies like that in shifts.So, needless to say I was very disappointed, my date fell asleep, so I took her home and went home mad.But wait.......many years later, I'm at the video store,and the shelves are picked clean like a carcass after the jackals.

More Coppola's Dracula than Bram Stoker's,"In 1992, acclaimed filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola brought his take on the classic Bram Stoker horror book Dracula to the world. Although the picture received generally positive reviews and solid financial returns on its original release, it has often been regarded as a fairly infamous adaptation of the gothic novel. Even with an impact on vampire lore, albeit modern lore, its bloated overly artsy execution has not aged well with everyone today, not helped by how much it has been lampooned and exploited in today's pop culture. But with all that aside, how is the film on its own?Set in 17th century Europe, English solicitor Jonathan Harker visits the ancient Transylvanian vampire Count Dracula, only for the count to come to England by means of seducing Harker's fiance Mina Murray due to her resemblance to his dead wife Elisabeta. Any differences from the original Bram Stoker book aside, the story itself does offer a fairly well balanced mix of gothic horror and fantasy romance. By portraying Count Dracula as a decrepit lost soul, he becomes much more sympathetic in nature, aided by a stunningly haunting performance by Gary Oldman. While his Oscar winning vampire costume and makeup might look goofy by today's standards, his youthful persona details a more genuine presence worth resonating towards. As for Mina, it is through the charismatic chemistry she displays towards the count that makes us all fall in love with them as the feature progresses in its pathos. Elevated through a poetically romantic performance from Winona Ryder and the chemically unorthodox love between human and vampire has not felt this believable in the years prior or onward.However, as romantically unhinged as the feature is, it might suffer from being a little too on the nose in its gothic execution. As frightening as the film feels in concept, the tone itself feels over the top in terms of tackling the more dramatic moments, as if we're watching an operatic rendition of the novel rather than a legitimate film. It doesn't help that many of the performances outside of Oldman and Ryder can be far too hammy to take seriously, especially Anthony Hopkins as Professor Van Helsing and Tom Waits as Dracula's insane former colleague R. M. Renfield. Arguably the worst example would have to be Keanu Reeves as Harker, coming off as so hopelessly amateurish and clunky that one would wonder how anyone thought he was the right choice. Also, in showcasing the more lusciously erotic sequences in a heavily crowded amount of production design, the filmmakers might have made the mistake of biting off more than they could chew. Long statements short, it appears that everything in the film pales in comparison to the wonderful romance of its leads.As far as other qualities go, the set design is a marvel to witness, recreating the look of an old Romanian castle and the retro villages in England authentically. It has been said that the film was initially timed to storyboards so that each shot could be planned accordingly, as well as to inspire the costume, sets and visual effects team to understand the type of film they were making more thoroughly. As jarring as the editing can feel every now and again, the notion of a pre-production animatic makes more sense given how much imagination and creativity was put into the world the film establishes. Thanks to some carefully crafted camera tricks and antiquated effects, the filmmakers made the most out of their resources without resorting to any outdated computer generated trickery. Certain forced perspective shots, matte paintings and rear projections give the film a dreary horror quality not often seen in features today. Presented through Michael Ballhaus' bold cinematography and aided by Wojciech Kilar's melodious score, the stellar production qualities cannot be understated.It is hard to say whether or not this adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula has stood the test of time, but there's no denying that a lot of hard work and passion went into it. Despite some cinematic hamminess and some odd casting choices, the stunning romance, gorgeous production design, and creatively gothic effects are worth remembering for how original and distinctive they appear from other vampire media. If you're a fan of Coppola's lesser known filmography or a sucker for anything vampire related, then there's no harm in trying this flick out. It ain't no Bram Stoker, but it sure has a soul of its own.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Do I look like a sucker to you?,"'Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992)' is a bit of a fever dream, a frenzied adaptation that powers through its story so quickly you barely have time to realise how weird it all is. Leaning into the otherworldly and sexual elements of its source novel, Francis Ford Coppola's extremely 90s picture is so relentless in its flashy presentation that its genuinely compelling aesthetic eventually fades to the background despite being shoved in your face in literally every scene. Basically, you become numb to the presentation because it's always operating at eleven, with almost each and every scene featuring a special effect, superimposition, split-diopter element or stylish match transition of one kind or another. Even as the story slows down in its midsection, each individual scene still flies by as if it's strapped to a rocket. There's so much stuff here that even the most stark and surprising elements sort of get lost amidst the general haze of unhinged atmosphere Coppola crafts within the first few seconds. Some of the best and most complex visuals appear just once and for what seem like mere moments, with Dracula's various beast forms being especially sparing in their use, and you get the sense that you'd be able to appreciate a lot of this a lot more if Coppola pumped the breaks every once in a while to build a sense of normalcy between the bizarre, to create a proper ebb and flow in the pacing and craft a more affecting sense of suspense and horror. As is, this throws everything at the (fourth) wall to see what sticks. The issue isn't that most of it doesn't; in fact, it's quite the opposite. So much of it sticks that you can't see past it, that you're still thinking about a visual gag from three scenes ago while you're being presented with an equally impressive effect. It makes it harder to appreciate, and remain invested in, than it ought to be.However, this approach does have its charms, as does the overall affair. The first half, particularly the elements set in and around Dracula's castle, is really effective at establishing and maintaining a specific identity that isn't especially scary but is sort of unsettling in its own way. It's no coincidence that the best aspects of the affair occur before you become fully accustomed to its ways. It's more interested in being weird than outright frightening - at least, that's how it seems - and this approach definitely means it avoids feeling like a retread of previous adaptations of its material. It has moody, nightmarish elements but it isn't afraid to be colourful or brazen, which instantly separates it from a lot of horror. It's quite camp, actually. It's hammy and over-the-top and always interesting, even when at its least propulsive or novel. The special effects are constantly impressive, especially since they're almost all achieved in camera. There are so many off-kilter and memorable images: the winding rocky road leading up to Dracula's castle (which looks like the Cortex Castle from 'Crash Bandicoot (1996)'), Dracula's evil gaze imposed over the thundering night sky, the shocking sight of rabid bestial sex between a werewolf and a woman, the uncanny way in which Dracula's shadow operates independently of him, the various gags involving a vampire's lack of reflection, the seamless transition from bat-like beast to swarm of rats, Dracula's quick flick and lick of Jonathan's blood-stained razor, and even something as simple as a pair of fangs jerkily growing in length as their owner's bloodlust rises all stick in your mind after the credits roll. It helps that the performers are all committed to their roles, with Gary Oldman doing the work in making his Dracula both horrific and horny (sometimes at the same time) and Anthony Hopkins making sure that Van Helsing is almost as creepy as his undead foe. Although Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves famously struggle with their accents (the latter especially), they remain eminently watchable and work as solid anchors for the outlandishness that surrounds them.The story sort of stalls when its action - and antagonist - moves to London. Here, it trips itself up on a whirlwind romance that doesn't quite capture the Gothic aspect it needs to in order to fully work. The fact that it's interspersed with bursts of sweaty supernaturalism doesn't do it any favours, as it's easily less interesting than those less developed elements. Although Dracula is alluring in his own way, I just don't buy that Mina would fall for him - or have memories of their ancestral (?) bond - and their bond doesn't really delve into the forbidden desire angle all that much. It kind of just springs out of nowhere and transforms the piece into a weird love triangle between a young woman, an old vampire, and a prematurely grey solicitor who spends most of this segment being sucked dry off screen by three seductive vampiresses. Alongside this, the flick focuses on the efforts to save a woman who is slowly turning into a beast of the night. The three men who tend to her - a cocky Texan, a vaguely grubby doctor, and a stiff-upper-lipped prick - are wacky enough in their own stock ways to not be totally boring, but their plotline is less enjoyable than the other more major stuff that's going on. In some ways, it feels like a bit of a distraction, serving only to bring Van Helsing into play and to make way for a finale in which these men work together with our main protagonists to take Dracula down once and for all. Of course, a lot of these problems likely occur in the original text (a book which, despite my best efforts, I haven't read past its opening chapter), pages from which are seemingly read as narration whenever the picture can't figure out how best to translate its source material's shift in perspectives and elliptical nature. These problems could have been eased during the adaptation process, though; it isn't necessary to bring a book's weakest aspects to screen simply because they exist on its pages.Ultimately, this is a distinct and technically impressive adaptation that constantly throws unsettling and inventive effects at the audience to both positive and negative effect. Its aesthetic is striking at first, but you quickly get used to it and its various surprises are no longer surprising. The story is uneven and sometimes focuses on its less interesting elements, and the picture never manages to be as compelling as it is during its segments set at Dracula's castle. Still, I kind of love how strange it all is. It's a truly full-on experience that spares no expense and is typically successful. It almost certainly isn't the best adaptation of its source material, but it's perhaps one of the most striking.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Thriller Meets Romance,"The Best Love Story I have ever viewed. What made this movie a masterpiece is that Copolla combined horror and romance and did such a great job.Eerie, passionate, and thrilling all at the same time. This movie had the best storyline of how Dracula was born. Punished by God to walk the face of the earth after cursing God's church. It gave meaning to Dracula's passion to kill, not just to feed in order to survive, but we see the hurt and pain in this man who lost his wife, and will not let anyone get in his way to recapture his long lost love.I watch this movie every year during Halloween.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Stylistic opulence at the expense of heart and soul,"this film is first and foremost about style.  the director  pulls out all the stops (perhaps excessively) to make for a visually striking, but also highly contrived, movie experience. the story and characters take second place to coppola's masterful stylistic manipulations as director. the costumes and set pieces are gorgeous.   the film's gothic atmosphere is highly charged with dark eroticism and sensuality, most obviously manifest in the character of lucy, played with slutty mischievousness by sadie frost.  keanu reeves is rarely a good choice for any part and here he is particularly ill-cast.  winona ryder, as delicately luminous and porcelain-skinned as she may be, also fails to give her character any real edge or depth. in the case of both young actors their silly english accents only emphasize their shortcomings in their respective roles.  anthony hopkins takes his usual place by pompously posturing as the brilliant but creepy weirdo.  gary oldman in the key role, however, is marvelously convincing as the tormented yet magnetic count dracula.  his performance is genuinely good.  but even dracula is secondary to the real point of this film: the showcasing of coppola's prodigious skills as a stylist, which alone is reason enough to watch",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Dracula revisited ... and revalued.,"This film tells the story of Dracula, the notorious vampire created by the imagination of Bram Stoker, based on the life of the king Vlad Tepes of Wallachia. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, James V. Hart has script and the participation of Gary Oldman (Dracula), Winona Rider (Mina Murray and also Elisabeta, first wife of Count), Anthony Hopkins (Van Helsing), Keanu Reeves (Harker, Mine groom) and Monica Bellucci (one of vampire brides of Dracula).The film seeks to tell the story faithfully Dracula to Stoker's novel, which is obviously one of the main attractions of the film. Indeed, Dracula's character has never been well treated by cinema: we almost only see this character in trash or low-budget films, unless the laudable exceptions of the Bela Lugosi's movie (1931) and some (few) movies with Christopher Lee. In this film, the gloomy atmosphere is stilted for photography and soundtrack, written by Wojciech Kilar. Make-up is also wisely used in various situations, highlighting some of the changes that the Count suffers, assuming grotesque shapes. The sensuality is also present in various scenes and characters. We cannot forget that, thanks to traditional bite in the neck, Dracula is one of the horror characters more directly linked with sexuality and lust.I don't feel able to make negative comments. The little that could be bad is well compensated by many highly positive characteristics. For all this, that is one of the best vampire movies of recent years and the best film about Dracula in decades. An opportunity to revisit and upgrade the character, giving him again a seriousness that he had lost, and that was very well used by Coppola.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Had its moments but overall average.,"This was a film I grew up hearing about and coming up in conversation so I finally sat down to watch this. To start with the plus points.. Gary Oldman was excellent as dracula and shows his versatility as one of the best actors of the generation. His performance is powerful, unerring and intimidating with and without the make up. Winona rider and Anthony Hopkins are well cast in for the parts and play them well. The story building was there and clear and easy to follow.
Now for the bad points. The story telling was a little hazy and the camera work seemed to be off action sometimes. Whether he went for this effect on purpose I guess with the times has not aged well. My biggest grievance with this film is Keanu reeves being cast to play a well spoken English man his acting seemed wooden and forced at times. But his accent is something I can not get my head around and would of been happier with his voice to be dubed. Overall it is a satisfactory watch all things considered and would agree its oscar winning antics considering the year of films released that year in the categories.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bram Stoker's Dracula,"This movie embraces the historical image of Dracula in all of his lure, romance, horror and seductiveness. It encompasses the mystery of the vampire; sex, seduction, horror, magic, and ruthlessness. Francis Coppola took these characters and brought them to life in this hauntingly powerful rendition of Bram Stoker's book. The settings and scenes are wonderfully glamorous and hypnotic. Each scene melts into the next. You experience the Gothic genre in its glory when Dracula and his brides tempt the souls of Mina and Lucy, which is the sub underlying theme of the movie. Starting with Mina witnessing the pillage of Lucy by Dracula, who has turned into a werewolf. The symbolism of sex, lust and weakness are rampid in this scene. Mina is confronted with the powers of Dracula, but his power overtakes her and of course, she forgets what she has seen. Mina is now ill minded, not knowing what she has thought and experienced, but knowing that she wants some part of it.There are many hypnotic effects in this movie that aren't even noticed until the third or fourth time seeing it. The Count's eyes are there, watching Mina, symbolisms of death and/or sacrifice come up when you least expect it, the movements of the Count are quite eerie as well. she has the perfectWinona fascinatingly takes this in and plays the part of Mina fabulously. You can look at Winona and know that this period piece will be spectacular, which it was. She embraces the part, like no other. Her and Oldman create magic, mystery and power in this movie. You come yourself, to believe, that they are lovers from a past life.Winona has the best face and presence for period pieces. She says that she is a bad inconstant woman, this depicts her character perfectly. She is good, yet her intentions become bad, all evolving from Dracula's power over her. He is whimsical, alluring, sexy, mysterious, fearsome and romantic. He plays the part to T. In fact, Oldman isn't playing Dracula, Dracula is simply playing him. By far, the best Dracula the big screen has seen, other than than Nosferatu of 1922. Yet Oldman is not only Dracula, but also a human being, with emotions, feelings and a longing for his long lost Elisabeta.The story line of Elisabeta being reincarnated as Mina, is quite fascinating, you don't see that too much in movies, especially a Vampire movie. Its very romantic, mysticizing and plays on the wild realm of imagination of the human mind.The special effects, imagery, plot, costumes and general directing of this movie is phenomenal. Its larger than life, but not in an obnoxious Hollywood way. You feel like you really are in 19th Century England, the Karpathians, and Transylvania and experiencing the fascinating mystery of Dracula. I give this movie a 10. Coppola created a Masterpiece with this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dracula,"This was alright! Scary in some places, boring in others, add some humor, (both intentional and unintentional) and you get a pretty good movie. Gary Oldman plays a fine Dracula here, sneering and slurping at every turn, he's pretty awesome, and Wynona Ryder as Mina plays a fine counterfoil. From there, it gets mighty curious, with Anthony Hopkins playing the most insane Van Helsing ever (he gets all the best lines, and is almost as insane as Renfield it appears) and yes, Keanu Reeves as Harker. Ahhhh man, Reeves killed me with that one. You haven't seen acting until you see the surfer boy deer caught in headlights pose Reeves always looks when he delivers his lines. So as you can see, something for everyone!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A deeply flawed, but periodically excellent rendition","This film features terrific art direction & costuming, but suffers from uneven acting performances and overzealous use of digital effects. Overall, Coppola's ""Dracula"" isn't a terrible film, but it isn't a great one, and nearly every scene has some noticeable flaw. Perhaps most importantly, many of the acting performances are simply not convincing. (Read: Keanu Reeves and Wynona Rider). In addition, Coppola seems insistent on oversaturating the viewer with Judo-Christean and sexual symbolism that, all too often, comes across as hamfisted and gratuitous. I think Coppola could have done more with less in this area. On the positive, Gary Oldman provides a fresh and multi-dimensional performance as the Count and Anthony Hopkins makes for probably the best Van Helsing I've seen. Lastly, I thought several of the scenes were very well conceived and totally memorable. The result is a very unbalanced, somewhat messy, but wholly entertaining piece that is, at times, unintentionally funny and, at other times, completely terrific. The script is, I'm told, quite true to Bram Stoker's novel and it should appease those seeking a more faithful adaptation. In total, Coppola's ""Dracula"" is one of the best recent adaptations of the famous Dracula story. It isn't perfect, by any means, but it definitely isn't garbage. ---|--- Reviews by Flak Magnet",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Really?,"Bram Stoker's Dracula??? Is the book really this terrible? I will get the book at the next convenient time and READ it. Because I just can't believe it can be this bad!Obviously there must have been some artistic freedom involved when the book was adapted for the screen and my feeling tells me that all that turned out so very bad has to do with only that: the adaptation. Other things obviously not being in the book were also really bad: Reeves performance and terrible wannabe English accent, Watts looks (because he looked like himself, not like a mad servant of Dracula's), lots of inconsistent and pointless details in the rest of the movie. To be honest - I had seen it shortly after it came out and it left a mixed feeling. Now I wanted to see it again to get a second chance of building an opinion... but... I didn't make it. I couldn't stand watching this movie all the way through. Normally I don't comment movies I haven't seen all the way through, but this time I felt I had to say what I think anyway.I couldn't connect to the movie at all. The performances in general sucked big time, there was no real feeling - it felt more like a circus with a several hour long and chaotic number with 399 overly colourful, completely (raving mad) shrieking, crying and shouting clowns!

Hauntingly Beautiful Story!,"Everything from the passionate encounters between Ryder and Oldman's characters, Mina and Count, to the eye-catching, enchanting gothic scenery had me absolutely mystified and my eyes glued to the screen.The story follows somewhat closely in comparison to the novel, giving life to the classic in quite a splendid retelling (if you will). Everyone is familiar with the story, or at least the character, Dracula, so going into this film I'm sure everyone has their own set of expectations. What I didn't expect was to be as intrigued and truly interested as I wound up being. The (just over) two hours of film manages to fly right by as Coppola shows us his take on this beloved classic. Oh, boy, I cannot tell you truly just how much every little detail of this movie from the shadows, to the scene's setting, to the character chemistries and portrayals, and last but definitely not the least, the score of the film pieces together a striking visual that is hard to forget.As many others stated on here in their reviews, Oldman sets the bar so high, giving the most untouchable performance as Dracula, that even the OG Dracula himself couldn't surpass nor could even wish to replicate it.Another great portrayal that I feel must be noted is Hopkins' role as Van Helsing. Hopkins' delivers this character to us in such a way that's so ""as a matter of fact"" that you wind up rooting for him as much as you do Dracula himself.So, why a 9? Why not a 10?Simply enough: Keanu Reeve's misperformance. His attempt at playing Johnathon Harker is as stiff and underwhelming as it is painful to watch. Watching him play Harker makes me truly wonder what the everloving hell Mina Murray sees in him. Obviously it's not his personality because the character falls about as flat as a cardboard castle on a rainy day. Surely someone as in love with his fiance as Harker claims to be would show a little more expression if things went as south as they did in this film. As big of a Reeves' fan as I am, I wholeheartedly believe this movie could have truly benefited from a different actor as Harker, and then would be without a doubt worth rating a perfect 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A dark and disturbing romance, a bizarre adaptation.","Dracula's classic comes to life with Coppola's work, being a story that combines different elements within one, remaining in itself as two main: Romance and terror.Dracula is a unique film in its design, execution and narrative. Sometimes it feels slow, other times it feels very fast, the scenes stand out for their great practical effects and camera angles, the design of Dracula is especially fantastic and probably one of his best reincarnations on the big screen. The atmosphere of the film stands out for its incredible gothic atmosphere, dark and mysterious, perfectly building the great weight that has the name of Dracula. It contains incredibly disturbing scenes, especially if we take into account the year in which it was released, also taking into account the lustful scenes that pass around the film, you could say that it is a sensationalist film.However, the film has a strange structure, feels rushed giving big blows in a premeditated way, the characters are not very calm, reaching almost unrealistic extremes, although it must be taken into account that the book also had certainly fantastic and sensational dialogues rather than realistic or logical.It is a good film of terror and romance, innovative and unique for its effect. However, the fear effect is probably not as strong as it used to be because of the outdated effects, and the romance is quite coarse and snatched. It's a good classic, which comes as a surprise with its incredible level of visual narration, with excellent disturbing scenes and an exciting ending. A classic, no doubt.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
This is right there with The Lost Boys as the greatest vampire film ever made,"Bram Stokers Dracula (1992) is one of my all time favorite movies and one I recently rewatched on HBOMAX (and is also in my personal collection). The storyline follows a London real estate agent sent to Transylvania to help a count purchase various real estate around London.

This movie is directed by Francis Ford Coppola (The Godfather) and stars Keanu Reeves (The Matrix), Winona Ryder (Heathers), Gary Oldman (True Romance), Anthony Hopkins (Silence of the Lambs) and Cary Elwes (The Princess Bride). The storyline for this picture is so well told. It delivers the backdrop of every scene perfectly as well as the intricacies of all of the characters involved and their thought process of the strange happenings. The self narrations are very well delivered. Every scene is magical and perfectly executed. The costumes, special effects and makeup are out of this world good.

"Not a horror, a tragedy","With the possible exception of Frankenstein's monster, there isn't a more venerated horror icon than that of Count Dracula. Created by novelist Bram Stoker in the late 1800's, Dracula is popular culture's ultimate icon of the idea of vampirism, the idea of the dead continuing to exist by feeding on the living. The most famous and enduring adaptation of the material is Universal's 1933 version, which starred Bela Lugosi and created the image of Dracula which has become the yardstick by which all versions are measured. In the early 1990's, director Francis Ford Coppolla decided to try his hand at the Count, and while his Bram Stoker's Dracula will most likely never be viewed as the definitive take on the novel, it is to me one of the more successful I have seen.I must admit that upon first viewing, Bram Stoker's Dracula didn't make much of a impression on me. It was a visually interesting work, that's for sure, but I felt that it was, like many of Coppolla's other ""experiments,"" an example of style over substance. It was only with repeat viewings that I began to see what I was missing the first time: this version of Dracula is much more a story of a tragic character trapped in damnation by his love for his lost bride than a horror story about an unredeemable creature tormenting the living.Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves), working for a London real-estate firm, is dispatched to the wilds of Transylvania, where he is to complete transactions with the mysterious Count Dracula (Gary Oldman) to purchase several properties in London. Once he arrives at his host's home, though, he quickly notices that all is not normal with the Count. The castle he inhabits is practically empty and in a decrepit state; the Count speaks of events of the distant past with the fervor and memory of a man who lived them, and the Count fails to eat, drink, or cast a reflection in a mirror. Upon seeing a picture of Harker's intended bride, Mina Murray (Winona Ryder) in a locket, Dracula believes her to be the reincarnation of his bride, Elisabeta, who took her own life in 1462 believing her husband killed in a battle with Muslim Turks that were invading Transylvania, which caused Dracula to renounce God and enter his current state, that of the walking undead. Dracula imprisons Harker in his castle and then sets out for London with the intention of taking Mina for his own.Meanwhile, Mina is living with her friend Lucy Westerna (Sadie Frost) who is busy juggling suitors, eventually deciding on Lord Holmwood (Cary Elwes), but not before Dracula can arrive and begin feeding on Lucy, turning her slowly into his minion. Another of Lucy's potential suitors, Dr. Seward (Richard E. Grant), has summoned an old mentor of his, Professor Abraham Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins) to assist in the case. It is Van Helsing who determines that Lucy's illness is not a disease, but the result of the feeding of a vampire. While using Lucy to meet his dietary needs, Dracula is trying to forge a relationship with Mina, but his plans are dashed when Harker escapes from his castle and Mina rushes to reunite with him, even as she is realizing that she does have feelings for the Count after all.In a departure from Stoker's material, screenwriter James V. Hart have transformed the character of Dracula from soulless creature to tragic figure. When the story has no real villain, it becomes difficult to root for the hero's to succeed, which makes Dracula a confusing watch, especially the first time. However, when viewed in the context of a tragedy, it becomes a more engaging story than if you were looking for a more traditional scare-fest.There are several standout elements in Coppolla's production, but few are more impressive than Gary Oldman's turn as Dracula. He embodies the character's naked ambition to be reunited with his love, mixed with his unending need to feed on the living. Oldman is most impressive as the aged Dracula seen at the beginning of the picture, before he transforms himself into a younger version to attract Mina. In the scenes set in the castle, Oldman commands the screen with his performance and is a treasure to watch.The film is also visually stunning, boasting some impressive costume design from Eiko Ishioka, giving a very different, more Asian influenced look to the characters in many situations that is a departure from the normal black coat that Dracula is most famous for. Coppolla and cinematographer Michael Ballhaus also utilize color rather boldly in the film instead of painting everything in various shades of gray as previous productions have been apt to do.This is not to suggest that the film doesn't have weaknesses. Aside from Oldman and Hopkins as the eccentric Van Helsing, the supporting cast is lackluster, most especially Elwes and Reeves. While the change in focus on Dracula from evil villain to tragic hero makes it more palatable for the other characters to not have much of an impact, the wooden performances from the supporting players is a significant failing of the film. Reeves, especially, seems miscast in the role of Harker, seemingly spending all his time focusing on his English accent and not on his performance. The star qualities later on display in films such as Speed and The Matrix are all but missing here. One final standout, though, is Sadie Frost as Lucy. She plays the character with a great deal of energy and playfulness, first as the young d√©butante searching for a suitor, then as Dracula's minion.When all is said and done, Bram Stoker's Dracula stands somewhat in the upper-middle of the stack of adaptations of the famous novel, but not quite at the top. The most important fact to remember when watching the film is to not expect a story of terror, but one of pathos.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Stunning story, settings and Oldman","The dark tale about the legendary vampire is brought to a vivid light by the brilliance of Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola in this dark fantasy horror.Gary Oldman (Air Force one) portrays Count Dracula beautifully, being both malicious but sensitive at frequent occasions as he travels to London and believes to have found a woman, who is a reincarnation of a lady he once loved many many years ago.This adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel is dark and powerful, with a strong focus upon the ideology of evil, with Oldman doing superbly to portray the Count's evilness against Anthony Hopkins' (Silence of the Lambs) goodness as Van Helsing.Keanu Reeves (The Matrix) is a bit of a let down as Jonathan Harker with his character not being in the film not nearly enough.Winona Ryder (Little Women) is excellent as Mina Murray, Count's love interest. The two perform well together, having tense and exciting scenes together.It's a very dark romantic tale for these two and is portrayed by Coppola in an exciting and edgy way.The settings used are fantastic with the darkness a key element to portray the mood of the characters and the situations.The film took a while to get going as it had a lot of character building to get through before building on the plot and the main theme of the film.This particular version of the legend is quite interesting because of Dracula's portrayal, in that he is portrayed more romantically than before, though still very gruesome and evil. It's interesting to take these factors into account as the film progresses.It's quite an erotic film with plenty of sexual tension from the leading actresses as Dracula becomes more involved with his victims.It is gruesome to with a lot of blood used to emphasise the evilness of the central characters and the suffering of the victims.It's a visually stunning dark film with great acting, great settings and an intriguing tale",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Dracula as a LOVE story? Pfff...,"If a book is adapted to the screen, it should at least somewhat follow the plot and spirit. Coppola's Dracula does not. I don't deny that Gary Oldman acted well, but come on... He's playing Dracula, not one of Ann Rice's vampires. Not a pathetic anemic pretty boy. Not a hero. Not something that deserves the least bit of sympathy. But an evil, revolting, murderous MONSTER that must be destroyed. Because that's what Dracula is.The book is about the band of friends that stood up to the despicable evil being that Dracula was. Coppola's movie is about a romance between Dracula and Mina. It was such an insult to call this movie ""Bram Stoker's"" when it was so far from Stoker's vision of Dracula as an ultimate creature of evil.It doesn't even stand on it's own as a film.

Obviously there were differences, but I was surprised how, in general, the film had remained true to the original plot.

Also, I think in the book we never discover the origins of Renfield - he was never a lawyer as far as I could tell and was merely a cruelly, manipulated lunatic. The film giving origin to this character clarified his significance to the overall plot. Beautiful, dark and mysterious.",,Anonymous,Horror
The theatrical and grand Dracula of Coppola.,"""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" is a two-movie that succeeds in passing an extremely gloomy, Gothic and terrifying mood, with an extremely theatrical direction, the long show all vampire classic archetype, sex, seduction, blood, shadows and monsters are exposed from A linearly beautiful and unique way. The script brings us the story of Count Dracula, imprisoned for centuries in this land after renouncing Christ for the church not wanting to bury his wife, realizes that his beloved reincarnated in London, and the same part for the English capital in the Victorian era to seek your beloved. The script, although confusing at times, is beautiful, the story is adapted from the spectacular book by Bram Stoker written in I897, which yielded numerous adaptations for the film, path is directed by genius Francis Ford Coppola, one of the best. Dracula is a passionate man who uses the sins and pleasures of the flesh to control everyone around him, a distinguished man who wanders unevenly across our land in search of a reason to live, the film touches on subjects such as sexual liberation, passion, Exploration of the myths for explanations, among others .... ""The Dracula of Bram Stoker"" Technically, Coppola's work is fabulous, with an incredible art direction, even in some moments, the effects are visible and extremely dated or even bad Made, this is part of the charm of the film that brings a very theatrical appearance, it is almost as if we were watching a piece or a long horror of the 1920s, the Coppola film exudes charm, nostalgia and care, with a highlight the soundtrack , Which does not let me lie in relation to the theatrical part, it is used several times, always from the weakest tone to the climax, it is worth highlighting the incredible and frightening makeup and again, never too much, a p Arab√©ns the direction of art and dark and yellowish photography. We have great performances here, although Keanu Reeves is not so well, Gary Oldeman is spectacular as Dracula and Anthony Hopkins sometimes scare more than the Dracula prophetic as his antithesis, Dr. Van Helsing, is worth a salve to the beautiful Winona Ryder as Mina , The beloved of Dracula, and Sandie Frost, who has a performance that highlights her wild beauty, and convinces and frightens her transformation into a vampire.

Listen to the children's of the night: They said that love never dies!,"As a child, i remember how i look the adaptation of the famous novel of Bram Stocker - in spite that my first real vampire experience at that time was classic F.W Murnau ""Nosferatu""- by Francis Ford Coppola: Was a horrible for me when i see all blood extravaganza in the beginning as in the scene where the the wolf scape of the zoo and Lucy is bitten by the beast. Was really a shock experience. The other things that my mind reminds and since then remember always is that frighting and powerful music. Now, i saw it complete and the shock not was so different as i remember.If all don't know the story or if it is based in a novel written at the beginning of the XX century - based in a real character-, all of us know who is Dracula (Much of it thanks to movies), but few adaptation catch the real thing, that darkness that make Dracula so famous. The adaptation of Francis Ford Coppola is, in spite of an almost big down in a moment in its plot, one of the best that i have ever seen (I apologize that i have not read complete the book, thing that i going to do soon). Closer of be the perfect Dracula (The best that i have ever seen is, without a doubt: Max Scherck of ""Nosferatu""), Gary Oldman embodies the ghostly and seductive essence of his character. The part in the cast is great too: Winona Ryder, Keanu Reeves, Anthony Hopkins, Bill Campbell and Edie Frost shines too. But maybe the most exciting and most characteristic that achieve the excellence is the image, the scenario, the colors and its music. The unforgettable -as a i say bellow- soundtrack is a real wonder. ""Bram Stocker's Dracula"" achieves in that point, something that movies like ""Meet in St. Louis"", ""Le faboleux destin de Am√©lie Poulain"" and ""Big Fish"" do in color and texture -althoug don't in the creepy meaning- . In this way ""Bram Stocker's Dracula"" is a real feast for our view.""Bram Stocker's Dracula"" is a recommended movie, specially if you a good breathtaking vampire movie with great performances and great direction.*Sorry for the mistakes...well,if there any.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Some of the scenes were truly awful i.e. when Dracula and Lucy meet in the garden. Buuut I still love it. It helped me fall in love with horror as a kid. Gary Oldman is my fave Dracula.

A fairy tale from childhood,"Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula (1992) is a spectacular reinterpretation of Bram Stoker's classic novel. The film combines epic scale with cinematic mastery, bringing a new perspective to the horror genre.One of the most important features of the movie is its visual splendor and attention to detail. From the sumptuous costumes to the gothic atmosphere, every frame is carefully crafted to immerse the audience in Dracula's dark and seductive world. Coppola's use of practical effects and innovative camera technology add to the film's eerie appeal, creating a sense of unease that lingers long after the credits roll.Moreover, the acting in Dracula is mesmerizing. Gary Oldman gives an engaging performance as the film's protagonist, capturing both his horrific brutality and his tragic humanity. Anthony Hopkins shines as the eccentric Professor Van Helsing, while Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves add depth as Mina and Jonathan Harker.At its core, Dracula is a story of love, obsession and redemption. Coppola skillfully explores these themes and combines elements of romance, horror and tragedy to create an unforgettable cinematic experience.All in all, Dracula (1992) is a timeless classic that continues to captivate audiences with its stunning visuals, powerful performances and haunting storytelling.

The Legend Comes to Live to the Eternity of Movie History,"Francis Ford Coppola was able to brilliantly captured the essence of the book by Bram Stocker. It was raw, real and with a magnificent work of edition, photography and costume design.The light engineering, with the management of the darkness, and the rendering of the storytelling was very well selected and made. Also the casting of actors were the best. Remember that both Keanu Reeves and Wynonna Ryder were in the early stages of their successful careers, and the bet in both was a lucky strick. As a viewer, I can't imagine better actors in the early 90's to portray Johnathan and Mina. However, the biggest surprise was the astonishing performance of Gary Goldman, and, of course, the slender work of sir Anthony Hopkins were out of this world. I only disagree with the excessive sex scenes with the symbolic redhead character Lucy. The lust is a sin connected with vampires, but I think that was overly used in the plot.Over all, with the passage of time, this film turn out to be a classic for the subgenre horror/ terror with the vampire theme. ""Dracula"" by Stocker, the first, the real, and the one and only was very respected by Coppola.

Stakes & coffins not the only wooden objects in this film,"I love the book ""Dracula"" by Bram Stoker and have always hoped for a film version that would do it justice. I realize it's not the easiest novel to translate to film, but still...The biggest mistake (IMHO) that Francis Ford Coppola made was casting Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder as the Harkers. Keanu Reeves plays Jonathan Harker as if he were in need of a good enema. And Winona Ryder (while good in movies like ""Reality Bites"") is clearly out of her depth here. I won't even mention their horrific attempts at English accents...What saved this film for me was Gary Oldman's sinister yet romantic portrayal of the bloodsucking Count. He made him more a figure of tragedy than horror. Two other factors are the set & costume design--atmospheric, beautiful. Sadie Frost and Tom Waits are a joy to watch. I always wondered about the inclusion of the character ""Quincey Morris"" in Stoker's novel. Was he thinking of his American audience? This guy is a caricature, a Victorian Marlboro Man...which is exactly how Bill Campbell played him. Richard Grant has some good moments as the morphine-addicted Dr. Jack Seward, but those 3 Dracula brides? Puh-leeze! They were about as ghostly as lactating cows.Although, overall, I did like this movie, the 1931 Bela Lugosi version (cornball as it looks now) is still closer in spirit to Stoker's great novel.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Beautiful and the only one of it's kind.,"this movie was a faithful adaption to the bram stoker classic. If he were still alive, he would be thrilled. The movie in itself is a passionate love story, balanced with a sense of evil and seduction. It's not overally bloody or sexual. It was damn near perfect. The Only thing that I have to complain about is Keanu reeves. He kind of took away from the beauty by adding his horrible acting. He is so robotic. other than that, the movie is flawless. this movie is the closest adaption to the classic novel. The characters are just right.

"Lavish, scary and engaging despite its problems.","The Dracula novel has seen a ridiculously high amount of film adaptations. But if anyone could bring something new then it probably was acclaimed Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola. Coppola made some very smart decisions when making the film, mainly deciding to stick closer to the book than most and paying many tributes to the iconic images seen in vampire films of old.The plot does stick quite close to the story. Young solicitor Jonathan Harker travels to Transylvania to sign over land to Count Dracula, who plans on coming to London to wreak havoc. However, upon seeing a picture of Harker's fianc√© he believes her to be his old lover and attempts to win her heart. Although many dislike the added romance it does offer a lot and shows that Dracula does have some kind of soul, making the character more three dimensional. It also adds to the plot as it makes the film more than a struggle against a beast, but a struggle to win the heart of a person. While most argue that Dracula should be a cold monster, I think that it was a wise decision to offer a more sympathetic version as one hadn't been seen before at that point. I'm especially impressed with how the story juggled all of its elements so well, as the romance never felt forced and the scary stuff worked superbly.You can forget about Bela Lugosi and Christopher Lee, as Gary Oldman steals the show with ease in an incredible performance as Dracula. He encompasses every single thing he needs to in order to make the role work, he can be both savage and creepy as well as humane and somewhat loving. Oldman made Dracula someone I feared but still felt sorry for , which is no simple task. He is still identifiable in a lot of make-up and the chilling accent is spot-on. Even the way he moves and expresses seem to have been worked to perfection. Should have won an Oscar in my book.The movies biggest stumbling block is with the acting however, seen with a trend of the support outshining the leads, bar Oldman, strangely. Sadie Frost puts a lot of energy in as the seductive Lucy and her feisty nature comes off well. Richard E. Grant is perfect for the part of Dr. Seward and plays the smart doctor well, even if he is underused. Both Cary Elwes and Billy Campbell do solid as can be jobs and make the most of their underdeveloped suitors. Tom Waits was also extremely enjoyable as the insane Renfield.The other three leads are the source of the films main problems for me. Keanu Reeves is horrifyingly bad here, there may actually be planks of wood that have more charisma than him. He is just so wooden in everything he does, his expressions don't convey any of the fear they should and his accent always sounds too fake to be convincing. Winona Ryder never truly convinces either. She just doesn't seem to know how to convey emotion properly and doesn't kind Mina the right depth, but she is just about acceptable. Anthony Hopkins just hams it up as Van Helsing and it comes across as ridiculous (He even humps Billy Campbell's leg at one point).Almost everything else in the film is spot-on. Coppola shot the film in extremely striking and attractive way, as almost every frame oozes richness. The effects are all in camera which is so impressive given the scale of some of them and they still look fantastic to this day, showing CGI isn't always needed. The costume design rightly won an Oscar. Everything fits the Victorian time frame perfectly and it looks beautiful as well as authentic. Dracula's many different costume are also outstanding. The locations look realistic as well, it really captures the gloominess of Victorian London and the makes Transylvania look like a creepy place.The scary scenes were just that and I'd say the film can boast some of the most wildly scary images of any horror centred film since the 80's. The film carries a very Gothic and eerie atmosphere that allows the scary moments to develop more, this is very apparent in the sequences in the castle which are really creepy. Dracula's frequent monstrous forms are demonic and frightening, they are also really well designed and add to terrifying aspects of the character physically. Other times when the film captures a classic horror feel are seen with Harker's encounter of the Brides and the confrontation with Dracula, which both rely on mood to produce terror and it works wonderfully.A lot of praise has to be given to Wojciech Kilar who composes one of the greatest scores I've ever heard. Kilar manages to create a score that has the absolute perfect balance of bone chilling and sweeping beauty. The music feels like it is coming alive at times and enhances certain scenes ten-fold. It is too great to really put into words, but it's one of the few soundtracks that can make you paranoid with fear as well as make you shed a tear of sadness.So does Coppola succeed in making the ideal Dracula movie? I'm going to have to say yes. Whilst I can see that there are aspects people won't enjoy, mainly the romantic sub-plot and some of the poor acting, the film has an extremely high amount of excellent features. The production design, effects and score are some of the very best you will see in film, and visually the film is still a magnificent achievement. It also achieves many of its aims, Gary Oldman is a superb Dracula, the scary moments are very scary and it sticks very close to the book. It may not be the perfect film, but it is extremely well made and very memorable.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"An epic love story, spanning time and space.......","Bram Stoker's Dracula is a love story. Coppola's vision of true love, as to reach through the folds of time and space, to reunite two lovers, is an epic retelling of this wonderful story that has had some additional competition in all media forms....Folks, this film won OSCARS. Great soundtrack, great acting from Gary Oldman for capturing that spark within Prince Vlad,  to bridge the gap between monster and man.....Sure, some of the acting within this tale was stilted, but considering the task to recreate the period piece, and to do it with young actors such as Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves, you have to give Coppola a lot of credit....Set Design, art direction, costuming, special makeup effects, they are all ""cogs"" within the wheel that drives this picture to greatness...Many films of this genre have come before this one, and many will come after....Regardless, I believe Bram Stoker would appreciate this retelling of his story the best....",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Wonderful adaption of the book,"I must admit that I didn't finish Dracula when I read it back in 6th grade. I got to the part about the zoo and then completely conked out and never picked it up again, so I'm glad this film followed the source material to the virtual T.Gary Oldman shows his trademark chameleon ability to inhabit whatever role he is given and his accent was overall spot-on as well. Anthony Hopkins as Van Helsing was an odd choice but he played the part of the eccentric monster hunter/physician surprisingly well, though his German (?) accent seemed to slip just a bit at times, especially during his initial appearance. My standards for Keanu Reeves are always low because honestly I feel he is a very wooden actor, and he proves this again in this movie, but everyone else picks up the slack with their phenomenal acting.The cinematography was clever in its fade outs and overlapping of images to convey simultaneous happenings, though sometimes it felt a little overdone. The outfits were well-researched and fit their respective characters perfectly in terms of their personalities, backgrounds, and of course for historical accuracy's sake.The ending felt the tiniest bit...cheesy but that's neither here nor there when it came to the journey.

The Pros and Cons of a modern Masterpiece,"First let me begin by saying this is one of my favorite films.  With that in mind, I will begin with the pros.  The Music:  The sound score is so overwhelmingly brilliant it adds just the right air of classical Victorian mixed with a tenor of dominating intrigue.  It is not as well mixed as the sound-score for Interview w/t Vampire but is definately one of my favorites. Gary Oldman's acting is the best rendition of Dracula to date.  His accent is flawless and he is politely charming and menacing all at once.  In all...his finest performance.  He can only be upstaged by Anthony Hopkins who is the first actor to ADEQUATELY portray the role of Van Helsing.  If you are familiar with the novel than you know that Hopkins' version stands truer to form than any other.  The cinematagraphy is the most amazing I have ever seen.  The camera angles, the lighting, the zoom-effects and the movement tricks are handled with such chaotic harmony that they are almost poetic.  Truly original and creative filming.  Renfield is truly the pitiable maniac that he is meant to be.  A sane man fighting for his soul. I can not offer this movie enough praise.  Every time I watch it, it scares the Hell out of me.  But...its not perfect. Alas...the cons. Keanu Reeves????????????  What were they thinking?  Why don't they get Boris Karloff?  I think Karloff could do a better acting job from the grave than Reeves did.  Reeves' performance did all but massacre the integrity of the story.  His British accent is so forced and inconsistent that it is pathetically laughable. Another bad element of the story:  We seem to have gone a little overboard with the costume concepts.  Yes...I know Dracula is supposed to be a blonde. And yes I know that he should be expected to wear the cultural garb of a Wallachian Boyar.  But he was just a little too frilly and ridiculous looking.  I mean...how damn long does your cape have to be?  It's a wonder he wasn't tripping and stumbling all over the place. Lastly....a little bit of clarification.  Many people believe that Dracula is supposed to be some kind of Romantic tale set within a Gothic atmosphere. It's not.  Read Stoker's novel.  His seduction of Mina is not about Romance.  It's about power.  Pure and Simple.  One human being exerting his power over another.  It is rape. Except in this instance it is not the raping of something relatively unimportant such as a person's body.  It is a rape of the soul and that is far worse and certainly not romantic.  Mina acts in ways that are completely uncharacteristic.  She is showed as being way to prim and proper to ever cheat on her husband to be with some stranger.  Dracula dominates her entirely.  She is not seduced or corrupted but completely overpowered.  Be careful not to confuse that dominative aspect of his villainy with passion or seduction.  It's not about that at all. The film...the novel...the lore...the history...the franchise.  All excellent.  Watch the film.",,Anonymous,Horror

I haven't read the book yet, but I've had friends that have read it and watch it and they were very able to enjoy the film, almost as much as I did.  No matter how true the movie is to the book, it dragged me in pretty well.In brief, Bram Stoker's Dracula is about a Romanian warrior fighting for the Catholic church.  As a lot of stories go, he won the battle.  But a messenger for the enemy sent a false message to the warrior's wife or girlfriend, one of the two.  The note said he'd died from the war and she committed suicide.  He got pretty darn p****d by this and did some weird stuff but it's dark and mysterious.  He lives on through many many years and sets his sights on Victorian London.The cast is surprisingly good, except one person.  Gary Oldman was perfect for the role of Dracula himself.  Winona Ryder sure surprised me with her performance.  Anthony Hopkins, always good.  But the real surpriser was Tom Waits in his supporting role.  Keanu Reeves was the only real downfall to the movie.  He was only really good in Bill and Ted, and maybe the Matrix. But nevertheless, surprisingly good acting overall.  The movie received three well-deserved Oscars.  Sound Effects, Costume design, and (particularly) make-up.

Visually stunning,"This movie came out in 1992. I like this movie. It's visually stunning with great special effects, sets, and costumes. However, the movie doesn't follow Bram Stoker's novel exactly. I know a lot of people dislike this, but I don't mind when it comes to this movie and also Dracula (1979). I'm more fussy when OTHER movies out there don't follow the novel they're based on exactly, or they massacre the story completely, such as what was done in the ""remake"" of The Haunting (1999). Now that, I have a problem with.How is the acting in this movie? It's very good, for the most part. I like Winona Ryder in her role as Mina Harker. She did a good job. Gary Oldman as Dracula was pretty good. I don't care for his long hair and sunglasses later in the movie, but I like when he's an old guy in the beginning of the movie. Keanu Reeves as Jonathan Harker was OK, while Anthony Hopkins as Van Helsing was good.When I compare the Draculas from this movie and the 1979 movie, my favorite is Frank Langella from the 1979 movie. He had more of the classic look of Dracula.The Gothic atmosphere, darkness, and overall feel is hard to beat. The movie definitely has a Transylvania feel to it and is visually stunning. The night scenes are especially good. Excellent use of lighting, darkness, shadows, and everything macabre.The musical score by Wojciech Kilar is good.I think the second half of the movie isn't as good as the first half.

So if you ask me about this film, i would say: Coppola, Gary Oldman, Score, Anthony Hopkins, atmosphere, lucy, make-up, sound effects, art direction, editing. 9 years on and it still working as the best erotic-horror movie ever, directed by the biggest director of 70¬¥s & one of the most brilliant of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Beautiful, Striking, Horror film with Romance.","Vlad Dracula (Gary Oldman) is a member of ""Order of the Dragon"", he fought against the turks in the year 1462. But when the love of his life (Winona Ryder) committed suicide thinking that Dracula died in battle. When he returns to his castle, seeing his dead wife. He decided to renounces in God and he desecrates his chapel. He declares that he will raise from his grave and to avenge his late wife with all the powers of darkness.Four centuries has passed... now the immortal Vlad Dracula wants to move to England for an new life. When a law clerk by the name of Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves) takes over the work of mentality unstable Reinfield (Tom Waits). He goes to Transylvania country to meet Dracula. Once he meets Dracula for arrange the formalities of Dracula's real estate acquisition in London. Once he arrives in his castle, he realized that Dracula is evil and he finds himself trapped in castle and being seduced by his three evil brides (Monica Bellucci, Michalea Bercu and Florina Kendrick).Dracula discovers that Harker's fianc√©e has the same striking looks of his late wife (Also played by Ryder) and her name is Mina. Dracula leaves his castle to meet her and hoping to seduced her that she can be immortal as well. Since Lucy's best friend Lucy (Sadie Frost) seems to be insane and waiting to drink blood, since she was bitten by Dracula. Dr. Jack Seward (Richard E. Grant) decides to get Dr. Abraham Van Helsing (Oscar-Winner:Anthony Hopkins) for help. Dr. Helsing realized that she is bitten by a vampire. Now Dr. Helsing. Dr. Seward, Lucy's fianc√©e:Arthur Holmwood (Cary Elwes) and Quincey Morris (Billy Campbell) has to destroy Dracula.Directed by Four-Time Oscar-Winner:Francis Ford Coppola (The Godfather Trilogy, Apocalyspe Now, The Outsiders) made an visually fascinating, horror film with romance and an dark sense of humour (Especially coming from Dr. Helsing's character). Oldman is terrific as Dracula, who also changes in different forms in the film. Ryder is strong in this movie in one of her best roles. Hopkins certainly steals the movie, when he is on-screen. Reeves isn't as bad as the Englishmen, he is at his best with the sequences with Dracula. He does his best with an underwritten role. While the supporting players Grant, Elwes, Campbell and Frost do well on their roles.The Blu-ray has an good anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) 1080P transfer and an strong PCM 5.1 Surround Sound (Also in Dolby Digital 5.1 only). The Blu-ray also includes an introduction of the movie by Coppola with an running commentary track by the Oscar-winning filmmaker. The Blu-ray includes three featurettes, 28 minutes of deleted scenes (Some of the deleted moments are good), original theatrical trailer and an teaser trailer.""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" is certainly an very good movie, it's does have some flawed moments. Sometimes, i felt, it was style over substance wins this movie over. It was certainly the last big hit that Coppola had in his career 18 years ago. ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" does get better over repeated viewings. The old fashioned special effects does help this movie. Winner of Three Oscars for Best Costume Design, for Best Sound Editing and Best Make-Up Effects. The movie also received an Oscar nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration. Also Michael Ballhaus' (Air Force One, Goodfells, Outbreak) cinematography is excellent. ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" is a visually perfect film but for story-wise and Reeves' somewhat weak performance put it down a bit. Otherwise, if you are an fan of Vampire movies or Bram Stoker's novel, don't miss it. Written by James V. Hart (Contact, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Muppets Treasure Island).

A TRUE MASTERPIECE!!!,"The best horror movie of the nineties, a masterpiece created by Francis Ford Coppola and J.V.Hart, based on Bram Stoker's homonym novel. This movie has everything: mystery, romance, black humour, sex, beautiful women, death, literature, religion, history, controversy, screams, blood, costumes, special effects,make up, gorgeous places, scary sound track, great and mesmerising epoque reconstruction, social drama and even is a very terrifying one. With excellent performances by Anthony Hopkins, Sadie Frost, a non exaggerated but multifacetic Gary Oldman as the torturated count (where is your oscar?) , and a never more neurotic Winona Ryder in her first ""19 century"" movie as Dracula's victim I think that Ms Ryder is the center of the movie and has the most difficult character, and she play terrible well this innocent and victorian girl, with her charisma and that beautiful brown eyes movement that only she can do, and of course her beautiful dark hair, who remembers me  other heavenly actress of the glory past such as A.Herpurn, N.Wood, O.Hussey and I.Adjani. Also good performances by K.Reeves, C.Elwes and R.E.Grant. Dracula was the first and best big horror gothic production of all the United States filmography history. The others like ""Interview with the vampire"" and even the ""Mommy"" there were not as inspired, romantic, clever  and of course terrifying as this cult movie. It is my favourite movie",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Gary Oldman and Winona Ryder - towering performances!,"Francis Ford Coppola's version of Dracula in 1992 certainly was a little different from 'normal' vampire films.I won't give anything away, but as the sub text says ""Love Never Dies"", the movie characterized Dracula as more of a romantic than previously believed. Don't get me wrong - Dracula (Oldman, whose performance as Dracula was possibly the best in cinematic history) was still evil!But that is precisely why this movie appealed to me - because it was a little different from previous Dracula movies.The performances by Gary Oldman and Winona Ryder - wow! I don't think I have ever any actor or actress speak with such a brilliant accent: that thick, syrupy Romanian accent dripping off Oldman's tongue - I mean, that guy IS DRACULA! Winona Ryder, one of my favourite actresses also put in a stunning performance as Mina Murray ('Harker' later in the movie). Her English accent and her sensual portrayment of a mortal in love with a monster (Dracula) was wonderful and unforgettable.The movie itself was of real quality, with other excellent performances from Anthony Hopkins as a slightly 'campy' Van Helsing, and Tow Waits playing the lunatic Renfield very impressively (pretty good for a rock star!).Whilst this movie may not appeal to fans of gore and sheer violence, it is a nice little diversion. The acting, the costumers, the sets, the special effects and indeed the reasonably-close-to-Stoker's original story makes this movie one of my favourite films of all time.There should be something in this film for everybody!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Worst movie EVER!!!,"This is a prime example of false advertising. The title indicates that it's the movie adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula but, with the exception of the character names, it has nothing to do with the book itself. It's a sexed up/Hollywoodian shell of the original story. It's a waste of time and I would have rather watched paint dry than this S%#&. Then again, with the exception of Mr. Hopkins and Mr. Oldman, the cast itself did not particularly build confidence of the movie being anything but ordinary. Back in Vlad Tepes' time, I think he would have used this movie to torture people instead of impaling them and ripping their limbs off.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sex and the Victorians-a heady combination,"The incomparable direction of Francis Ford Coppola combines well with Bram Stoker's vampire potboiler in this millionth retelling of the Dracula story. Featuring a mostly outstanding and delightfully surprising cast (note Tom Waits' role as Renfield), it serves up a touching story of a love condemned to live past death in a swirl of ornate costumes and a shower of blood. Yet it is more than a basic sex-and-blood vampire romp; Coppola's script, which is fairly closely based on Stoker's 1898 book, subtly explores Victorian ideas about class, religion, and sexuality while still presenting enough of a symbolic spectacle to keep intelligent viewers interested.  After all, Stoker's ""Dracula"" was a popular novel that only recently gained academic respect, and its leap from book to stage, and then stage to screen, was an entirely popular and natural one.  How refreshing to see amidst the puerile carnage of vampire flicks one that reflects and enhances the respect ""Dracula"" richly deserves.",,Anonymous,Horror
Fangs a lot!,"Top notch production that is sabotaged only by weaknesses in the original story and by Reeves, who is a generally woeful actor in any movie not named ""The Matrix"". Oldham does fine in scenes opposing him but Ryder, who is supposed to be a weaker character, seems unreal because who could be more of a schlump than Keanu? It is a travesty that he played this part and I assume it was a studio requirement to get the movie made. Otherwise, the pace, cinematography and acting are first rate. As I said the story is not first rate, owing to the predictability of (nearly) any horror finale. Still, the ending is accomplished better than most of the genre. Sadie Frost gives a fabulous performance that, along with Oldham and Hopkins, holds the film together. Well worth seeing if only as a fine example of movie craftsmanship, but there is plenty of eye candy of all kinds, too.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Second Best Dracula,"To tell the truth, I'd rather watch this than any other Dracula and I have many times. But, I just can't bring myself to say it's the best, because I've still gotta give that to Bela Lugosi. Third goes to the bizarre Dracula by Warhol (well, Morrissey, really). I could get effusive about this movie but won't. It is rather true to the Stoker novel with the addition of 'prequel' data about the said source of the vampire legend, Vlad the Staver.The sets are extravagantly gorgeous, the interiors lavishly opulent and almost smell of decay. Everybody dies over Coppola's Godfather series but or Apocalypse Now. They're great movies but I can't watch any of these again whereas I'd watch Dracula again right now. I think it is the most artistic direction of Coppola's career to date. The casting and acting are superb. I love Gary Oldman and this is my favourite of his. So sensitively portrayed with such a commanding presence.Keanu Reeves has always been a bit stiff but that trait is used as an asset here. Dracula's brides are definitely the stuff of arousal and Dracula's gay side exposure was eloquent with little verbiage. The capper in the acting category was the brilliant touch of Tom Waits as Renfield.Get comfortable and immerse.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Visually Impressive, and Not Too Bad Elsewhere","Francis Ford Coppola has always been a two-faced director.  He can be subtle and atmospheric in his style, or he can go all out crazy with visual element of his production.  He is great either which way.  This film and ""Apocalypse Now"" are the only two Coppola films that are really swamped with visual beauty.  Sweeping cinematorgraphy and terrific set designs only enhance the splendor.  It may be too much for some to take, but I personally hold no objection to visual indulgence in film.So, we established the incredible technical production of the feature, but I needs mention the film does have problems.  The acting, for the most part, is either below average.  Winona Ryder, whose usually rather good, fails to present anything other than acting either incredibly stupid or horny. Hopkins, as so frequent later in his career, just sleep walks through his role.  Gary Oldman is the best of the cast as the title character, though he does (as usual) go a little over the top at moments.  As far as Keanu Reeves goes, I doubt anyone was expecting him to be good anyway.The screenplay is above average, but not superb.  Firstly, cinema and books are two COMPLETELY DIFFERENT forms of artistic expression, and no  one should evaluate the quality of one based on the other.  That said, the dialogue well written, and the film kept a linear focus, good for what Coppola was trying to achieve.If you don't like an overload of visuals in your film, or are pre-determined to hate it because it varies from the source material, stay away from this film.  If you enjoy style saturation and realize the difference between films and novels (as I do), I think you'll quite enjoy it.7.5/10* * * 1/2 / * * * *",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent!,"This movie was stunning in its depiction of the monster that we all love to hate.  Gary Oldman did an unbelievably spectacular job of making the Count a despicable murderer, a grotesque old man, a sexy seducer and someone extremely pitiable.  The settings were marvelous and the period clothing was breathtaking.  Wynona Ryder played the lovely Mena superbly and Tom Waits gave a chilling depiction of Renfield that cut to the bone.

Just my thoughts on one of my favorite movies of all time.,"The casting for this film was great.  The movie didn't include all the details of the book but it showed key elements.  I loved Winona Ryder as Mina and Gary Oldman's portrayal of Dracula.  The scene where the wolves are howling outside of the castle as he says ""the children of the night, oh what beautiful music they make"" and the look in his eyes were very believable. Keanu and Winona also portray their characters very well and Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Van Helsing was very entertaining.  The quick shots, ie. when Dracula stalked Lucy, also added to the effect well.  I also thought the backgrounds and sites were perfect.  Hey and the three seducing vampires were not bad either, of course they were not as captivating as Mina.  One of my all time favorite movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

It's dark with a Gothic Mood, Romantic, Dramatic and the such a magnificent ending...I wept at the ending, I'll tell you the truth. There are great and emotional actors, a beautiful performance by Winona Ryder and Gary Oldman. For Francis Ford Coppola, I compare this film to THE GODFATHER trilogies, that's how well-done it is. I highly recommend this film for anyone, anywhere, any time at any pace. The most emotional scenes are in the beginning and end. The beginning when we see Dracula fighting as a warrior (Oldman looks a LOT like Vlad The Impaler, it's scary), and finds that his lover is killed by the church, Dracula is filled with anger and stabs the giant cross. Blood seeps from the cross and then we see the title. And the ending is so emotional and beautiful that you must see the movie. 10/10 always, and you should even stay for the end credits to hear Annie Lennox's touching song.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
More Coppola Than Stoker.,"Some three decades later , this Francis Ford Coppola directed movie (he also produced) makes an attempt, as the full titles suggest, to go back to the original source material. However we are dealing with a filmmaker who is known for his considerable ego and that becomes very evident in how the movie turned out. It does follow the outline of the book, but Coppola takes considerable liberties with the storyline and with some of the characters. He envisioned DRACULA as a love story or to use his description as ""an erotic fairy-tale"". Nothing really new here as that's what Hammer's 1958 DRACULA with Christopher Lee was but as this was 1992, Coppola could be and was far more explicit in his eroticism which leaves little to the imagination.. Yet another example of a filmmaker saying that this is what the author really intended. Bram Stoker would disagree. It's really too bad as there is much to admire in BSD from a technical standpoint. There is no CGI used and the movie was completely shot on sound stages with the visual effects done in the camera. The look of Victorian England is nicely captured and the use of primary colors does create a fairy tale atmosphere.The performances are definitely a mixed bag. Gary Oldman's vocal mannerisms, trying to out-Lugosi Bela Lugosi, are frequently unintelligible and often unintentionally amusing. (Thank goodness for subtitles on this Blu-ray.) Oldman's eccentric take on the Count will either impress you or annoy you completely. Anthony Hopkins is a solid if somewhat disheveled Van Helsing while Keanu Reeves is not nearly as bad as contemporary reviews have made him out to be. (It is unfortunate that his hair keeps changing color.throughout the movie) Winona Ryder, a quintessential 1990s actress, isn't really credible in her role as a 19th century heroine (see Isabelle Adjani in Werner Herzog's 1979 remake of NOSFERATU). Tom Waits, a Coppola favorite, is a subdued and very effective Renfield while Sadie Frost, in her film debut, transforms from Victorian maiden into sexually aroused vampire victim, but under Coppola's direction, her later scenes would have benefited from a soupcon of restraint. Final verdict: I enjoyed BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA, but not as much as I was hoping to...For more reviews visit The Capsule Critic.",,Anonymous,Horror

Highly paced and special-effects extravaganza of Bram Stoker's eternal classic.,"The brilliant Mr. F.F Coppola (The Godfather, Apocalypse Now) directs an adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula.He wisely sets the pace as a good one omitting unnecessary dialogues and scenes. He decides to dazzle our eyes by providing a visual feast of special effects.The casting is good too. With veteran actors like Gary Oldman as Count Dracula and Anthony Hopkins as Van Helsing what could go possibly go wrong? Also as a bonus: the handsome Keanu Reeves as Jonathan Harker and the sexy Winona Ryder as Mina and Elisabeta.Now for the story. It is a love story as well as a horror story.In 1462, Vlad Dracula (Gary Oldman), a member of the Order of the Dragon, returns from a victory against the Turks to find his wife Elisabeta (Winona Ryder) had committed suicide after hearing false reports of his death. Enraged at the notion of his wife being eternally damned as a suicide, Dracula desecrates his chapel and renounces God, declaring that he will rise from the grave to avenge Elisabeta with all the powers of darkness.In 1897, law clerk Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves) takes the Transylvanian Count Dracula over as a client from his colleague R.M. Renfield (Tom Waits), who has gone insane. Jonathan travels to Transylvania to arrange the formalities of Dracula's real estate acquisition in London, including Carfax Abbey. Jonathan meets Dracula, a wrinkled, pale old man (Oldman) inhabiting a bizarre castle. During the signing of the papers, the Count discovers a picture of Harker's fianc√©e, Mina (Ryder), and is astonished to find that she is the reincarnation of Elisabeta. Dracula leaves Jonathan to be seduced by his brides (Monica Bellucci, Michaela Bercu, and Florina Kendrick) and sails to England with boxes of his native soil, taking up residence at Carfax Abbey. His arrival is foretold by the ravings of Renfield, now an inmate in Dr. Jack Seward's (Richard E. Grant) neighboring lunatic asylum.In London, Dracula emerges as a werewolf-like creature amid a fierce thunderstorm and hypnotically seduces, then rapes and bites, Lucy Westenra (Sadie Frost), with whom Mina is staying while Jonathan is in Transylvania. Lucy's deteriorating health and behavioral changes prompts Lucy's former love-interests Quincey Morris (Billy Campbell) and Dr. Seward, along with her fianc√©e, Arthur Holmwood (Cary Elwes), to summon Dr. Abraham Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins), who during a blood transfusion recognizes Lucy as the victim of a vampire. Dracula, now young and handsome, meets and charms Mina. However, when Mina gets word from Jonathan, who has escaped the castle and recovered at a convent, she travels to Hungary to marry him. In his heartbroken fury, Dracula transforms Lucy into a vampire. Van Helsing, Holmwood, Seward, and Morris kill Lucy to stop her undead suffering, and save her from eternal damnation.As Jonathan and Mina return to London, Jonathan and Van Helsing lead the others to Carfax Abbey, where they destroy the Count's boxes of soil. Dracula enters the asylum, where he kills Renfield for warning Mina of his presence, and visits Mina, who is staying in Seward's quarters while the others hunt Dracula. Dracula confesses that he murdered Lucy and has been terrorizing Mina's friends, but a confused and angry Mina admits that she still loves him and now remembers her old life as Elisabeta. At her insistence, Dracula begins to transform her into a vampire. The vampire hunters burst into the bedroom, with Dracula claiming Mina as his bride before escaping by changing into thousands of rats. As Mina begins changing the same way Lucy had, Van Helsing hypnotizes her and learns via her connection with Dracula that he is sailing home in his last remaining box. The Hunters depart for the port of Varna to intercept him, but Dracula reads Mina's mind and evades them. The Hunters split up, with Van Helsing and Mina traveling to the Borgo Pass and the Castle, while the others try to stop the Gypsies transporting the Count.At night, Van Helsing and Mina are approached by Dracula's brides. They frighten Mina at first, but she gives into their chanting and attempts to seduce Van Helsing. Before Mina can feed on his blood he places a communion wafer upon her forehead, leaving a mark. He proceeds to surround them with a ring of fire to protect them from the brides. In the morning, he infiltrates the castle and decapitates them. As sunset approaches, Dracula's carriage appears on the horizon, pursued by the hunters, and arrives at the castle. A fight between the hunters and gypsies ensues and at sunset Dracula bursts from his coffin. Harker slits his throat while a wounded Morris stabs him in the heart. As Dracula staggers, Mina rushes to his defense. Holmwood tries to attack but Van Helsing and Harker allow her to retreat with the Count, turning instead to Morris, who dies surrounded by his friends.In the same chapel where he renounced God centuries earlier, Dracula lies dying, now in an ancient demonic form. He asks Mina to give him peace, by stabbing the sword through his heart. They share a final kiss, as the candles adorning the chapel miraculously light in God's presence, and the hole in the cross heals itself. Mina shoves the knife through his heart. The mark on her forehead disappears as Dracula's curse is lifted, as well as Elisabeta's soul. She then decapitates him and gazes up at the fresco of Vlad and Elisabeta ascending to Heaven together. Mina is then finally free.Actors of note: Gary Oldman is OUTSTANDING as the portrayal of Dracula. Along with Winona Ryder playing both as Elisabeta and Mina. Anothony Hopkins needs no introduction and he plays his part effectively. Keanu Reeves is disappointing as he has a small part in the movie.Overall a must have for your DVD collection. Overall 10/10 a visual Masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

This is exactly what a vampire film should be, packed with sexual tension between the characters with a tragic ending. Please feel free to e-mail me on your opinions.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Graphic and Repulsive but Frequently Wonderful Aesthetic Values,"It's very difficult to say whether this film is good or bad.  I found the gore excessive (the movie teeters as if on the tip of a needle, without falling into either the drama or horror pools), and I found the levels of nudity and sexuality (note:  I found the ""brides of Dracula"" and ""Lucy meets the Dracula/wolf hybrid creature"" scenes to be disgusting and disappointing in the extreme) quite superfluous and repulsive; still, the majority of the images in this film and the way it's played out make it very attractive and memorable.Winona Ryder's performance is fairly enjoyable.The two other major players in this film are more enjoyable.  Gary Oldman plays a very good Dracula with whom it is difficult not to sympathize (well, most certainly not when he's renouncing God, but later in the film!).Anthony Hopkins is set most directly against Dracula, and the viewer will no doubt spend much time cheering for him, as well.  Oh, he's fantastic, yelling with glee about Lucy's ultimate fate (""She is the devil's concubine! Ha ha!""), waving crosses at the undead and invoking God's protection.  He plays Dr. Van Helsing as much, much more fanatic and, well, enthusiastic than Stoker's original character, but this interpretation is quite entertaining, and of course the plot diverges from that of the book sufficiently that the book's portrayal of Van Helsing would have seemed out of place here.By presenting the viewer with such enjoyable characters on opposite sides of the Eternal Struggle, the film attains a bit of a feeling of dichotomy and frankly left me somewhat depressed and confused.  Still, it is visually appealing (in those scenes that did not inspire its R rating), to the point that I find myself wanting to watch the exposition (including Harker's earlier experiences in Dracula's castle) and some of the Van Helsing scenes over and over.  The film lacks the depth of, for example, ""The Godfather,"" but it does show that Francis Coppola is a very competent visual director.The film is not perfect, and it indulges far too much in sex and violence at times, but it is very frequently entertaining.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Beautiful film.  The relationship of Dracula is winning.,"After watching the pitiful John carpenter film Vampires,   I find Bran Stoker's Dracula to be extremely artful,  full of amazing acting,  and erotically romantic.  I instantly fell in love with Gary Oldman and Winona Ryder as the two rekindled their love in a daring and rich fashion.   And talk about performances,  Winona Ryder with her dazzling curly long black hair,  her blood and yearning fiery emotion, I was absolutely dazzled. The movie for me took a while to get into to.  But eventually the film gets better with the the possession of the two female ""victems.""  This film even makes blood look lovely and extravagant.  This is one of the few films where I wanted Dracula to win and i saw Hopkins as a nuisance,  a pest if you will.  His performance was good,   but his role alone with Keanu Reeves was very limited.  Keanu wasn't bad as an actor,   but I would much rather see him in the sexy Devil 's Advocate.   The sets ,  costumes,  and make up was magnificient and I feel this must be the greatest Dracula film ever creted.  After teeny bopper films like Beetlejuice,  and Edward Scissorhands,  I never knew Winona could act,  but this proves that she does have potential.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Amazing,Romance,Love,Fear,Surprise,Desire,and one scary dude","Bram Stoker's Dracula I have seen this movie at least 70 times. The thing that stands out above all is this beautiful/complicated love story that spans centuries.A monster that can change form or become formless. The ""Monster"" is not the Dracula you remember from Lugosi or Christopher Lee. This monster is very powerful, very powerful. The only part of this movie that is hard to believe; is that this creature/man has survived centuries, has ample opportunity and the means to kill everybody in the cast, yet allows himself to be slain and be separated from his lifes love. The first time I saw this movie I wasn't all that impressed, but something about this movie attracted me, and I had to watch again, and again. This is first and foremost a romance. Watch everything, especially the shadows. Dracula got my respect on this one, the only problem is, that now I want to be Dracula. To have power over the beasts and the wind,to be able to cross oceans of time. Congratulations to everybody involved in this film, and thank you very much.

More than 80 years on, the 1931 Bela Lugosi version has lost none of its power to chill and thrill. Lugosi had honed the role on stage, responding to nightly audience feedback - and the 1931 version had incorporated what Lugosi had learned. Part was very simple indeed - Dracula's super slow pace contrasted with frenetic Renfield. It marked Dracula as being in some way not human. Dracula appears on the surface to be courteous but as becomes clear, this is only to better trap his victims much as a meat eating plant emits a sweet smell to attract insects. Dracula's conversation is limited to serving his simple purposes - because that is all he has - a simple purpose.Here, Dracula has become, apart from latex makeup, a bore, someone with a penchant for very extended discussion of his inner thoughts, the person who button-holes people and insists on telling them his life-story.Looking at the 1931 version, one wonders if the subsequent 80+ years have been a time of adding to the the craft of film-making - orsubtracting from it.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Horror Film, or Overall Horror?","When Bram Stoker's Dracula came out in 1993, I knew I had to see it, but I was 4 years old back then.Fast foward 9 years,it is know 9th August. I had just bought Lord of the Rings on DVD, looking at my Pay-TV providers Tv guide, I noticed that this movie was on. I switched on in great antcipation.The opening scene was a good job, with Anthony Hopkins using a German accent to help tell the story, a Story not mentioned in any of the Dracula movies.However, as the movie went on, it went to a completely different complex, and after 40 minutes of watching, I turned the channel to X-Men instead.I'm not saying that this is a bad film, it's good, but In my opinion, just a tad too scary, Watch if you dare",,Anonymous,Horror
"A stone-cold classic, and one of Oldman's many great performances","There's nothing negative to say about Dracula, except for some overused special effects at the beginning, but it is luckily only a minor issue. The list of positive things to say about the film, however, is big. Bram Stoker's Dracula is an absorbing experience. The cinematography's great, everything visual about the film (except for some overused special effects) is pure eye candy. Francis Ford Coppola truly got it right. Make-up and costume design add a lot to the atmosphere as well. All of those ingredients creates the masterful atmosphere of Bram Stoker's Dracula. Gary Oldman proves once again that he is one of my favorite actors of all time. Dracula might be one of his 3 best performances ever, and that says a lot. Anthony Hopkins as Abraham Van Helsing was a good performance too (and sometimes amusing). Winona Ryder pulls off a noteworthy performance as well.It doesn't have enough entertainment value to have you glued to the screen for it's entire running time, but it's atmospheric chills, great screenplay and a terrific performance from Gary Oldman should be more than enough to get your attention.Moose finds this film worthy of a 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Magnificent.,Is the spectacle that is Bram stokers-Dracula. Based on part of the life of Vlad Tepesh at the height of London's economy boom leading to the most auspicious of encounters between the count & a clergy man thus leading on a cinematic spectacle to this day unsurpassed and some of the most engaging roles to hit the big screen mostly due to arguably the best depiction of Dracul to date by Gary oldman and a great cast in keannu Reeves & Winnona Ryder and ofcourse Anthony Hopkins as Van helsing.

A Modern Classic!,"Dracula is just one of those movies that provide the opportunity to scare you no matter how many times you watch this. It's all because of the acting, costume design, and makeup. It all looks too real even though it's not.This is based of Bram Stoker's novel, Dracula. Dracula has been waiting years to find his one love. That time arrives in Victorian London. Dracula heads to London to face his love once more.Gary Oldman makes the perfect Dracula. He was the perfect choice to play the Count. Anthony Hopkins who also was magnificent must have a fling for mystical creatures since he also starred in The Wolfman.Overall, this is a great movie but it was a little slow at first. It's great for Halloween. So move over Saw and Paranormal Activity, this is the true Halloween classic. I rate this film 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Fantastic atmospheric horror,"Of all the mythological scary creatures, none might be as popular as the erotic and malevolent ""vampyr"" especially when Hollywood comes into play (11 vampiric movies come to mind right away: Nosferatu, Dracula, Phantom of the Night, Salem's Lot, Bram Stoker's Dracula, Interview With the Vampire, Night Flier, John Carpenter's Vampires, Blade, Dracula 2000 and Shadow of the Vampire). Hollywood doesn't always make good vampire movies, but they sure do give it the ole college try. And Bram Stoker's Dracula, starring Anthony Hopkins, Winona Rider, Gary Oldman and *shudder* Keanu Reeves, is one of the best.This version of Dracula tells the story of Prince Vlad Dracul (Oldman), who renounces God after his fiancee commits suicide and drinks her blood as a replacement for holy life. The result is eternal undeath, and the story picks up at the turn of the 19th/20th century. Here it is the same old story. Dracula entertains real estate agent (Reeves) and falls in love with agent's fiancee (Rider). Lots of sex, lots of violence. Dracula is tracked by obsessive doctor with extensive knowledge of diseases of the blood (Hopkins). Lots of Latin, lots of crucifixes, lots of decapitations. Climax between Dracula and the fiancee and his pursuers. End. Credits.This is not to undercredit the plot, for it is indeed wonderful. It is excellently-paced and atmospheric to the core - this is definitely one of the best atmospheric horror movies ever. Coppola's directing is superb, using light and shadows to create a fairy-tale unreality at first, and later a brooding malevolence that culminates in the final red-tinted climactic sunset chase. Coppola also uses jerky camera movements and hectic splicing to create first-person views that are both real and dreamlike. And he uses these to perfection. Dracula is a pleasure to watch and soak in the atmosphere.The acting is fine all around. Well, almost all around. Oldman is fantastic as the many incarnations of Dracula, lending the role the vehement evil it requires while adding the melancholic longing necessary to the plot. Hopkins is not disappointing. He is a first-rate actor and provides a first-rate performance as the eccentric yet intelligent Dr. Van Helsing. Rider proves herself capable to stand beside Bette Davis and Ingrid Bergman as one of the greatest actresses of all time. Her portrayal of Mina Murray, the fiancee torn between the suave and handsome Prince Dracula and her true love Jonathan Harker, is heart-wrenching and pity-inducing. Unfortunately that leads to Harker, played by the abominable Keanu Reeves.Reeves is a hack actor, incapable of playing even the least demanding role (and this one was not very demanding). His stone-faced, surfer-boy acting in the face of the greatest evil he has ever come in contact with is deplorable. The fact that someone dared cast an actor this terrible in such an excellent movie is disturbing (the same should be said for The Devil's Advocate and The Matrix, as well). Reeves is the lone blemish on this movie, and while he doesn't ruin it altogether, his presence on the same set with actors such as Hopkins, Oldman and Rider is ludicrous and unfortunate. The only thing Reeves does well in Bram Stoker's Dracula is narrate Harker's diary, which is not surprising considering how narration is generally monotone anyway.But -- with the exception of Reeves (and everything good about Dracula must be used in this context) -- ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" is not only one of the best vampire movies ever, it is one of the best movies period. Fine acting, perfect directing, interesting plot. And enough violence to make even the generally brainless modern-slasher fans happy.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Coppola's finest, Dracula is an epic film.","What do you get when you combine Francis Coppola, Gary Oldman, Anthony Hopkins and a timeless horror/romance story?  Bram Stoker's Dracula.  I've seen many good films, and this one rates up there in the top five.  The acting is superb, the dialogue is convincing, the special effects are amazing, the cinematography is ... I could go on and on.  It won three Academy Awards, one of which for costume design and implication.  Watch the film and you'll agree with that completely.  Pretty much the point I'm trying to get across is this:  If you're looking for a horror film with just as much romance and depth, don't mind a little gore and LOVE well-acted pictures; watch Bram Stoker's Dracula.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Would make Ed Wood proud!,"Poorly cast, poorly written, and missed the point altogether. The entire thing seemed to focus mainly on sex when the story is strong enough to carry itself if well executed. The costumes and effects could've worked well enough if Copola had put more thought into the roles. None of the actors really worked with their characters; casting Keanu Reeves was a big mistake. It seemed like the main point was trying to stuff as many big names into one title without thinking it through at all.At least it isn't as bad as the 1970's version, but that's really not saying much.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
I wasn't the biggest fan.,I didn't really like it. I really liked the novel and I thought that the movie was eccentric and a little over the top. Everyone I was with was laughing at the erratic blood eruptions and the melodrama of the whole thing. The 1931 was a bit better. I would go for that one even though the technology was certainly more primitive then. I didn't think the acting was that bad - Anthony Hopkins was a funny Van Helsing and Keanu Reeves did a decent job. Winona Ryder was pretty good and Gary Oldman was really creepy. So I can't say anything about the portrayals ~ the movie itself was just a little too over the top and filled with unneeded pathos for my taste.,,Anonymous,Horror

Best Version of Dracula,"I strongly feel that THIS is the best Dracula film ever made. Unfortunately Bram Stoker's Dracula is highly under-rated and over looked today by what I would consider contemporary snobbery resulting in a divisiveness of any film lacking in the over-saturation of obvious and unrealistic computer effects and the fashion of mocking such actors as Keanu Reeves.No other version of Dracula has come this close to following the original novel by Bram Stoker. This film is the most faithful adaptation of Dracula to date and it also gives depth and personality to Dracula that no previous version had before.There are some changes from the original novel but it does not hinder the story but rather enhances it. In this film Dracula and Mina were in love with each other and Dracula is more or less redeemed through love, and other than that embellishment is, to date, the most faithful film adaptation of the Dracula novel by Bram Stoker. This film is beautiful and very Faustian. But don't think that romantic and humanistic redemption makes this like the sappy, sparkly vampires you see in the undeserving of mention- Twilight. Dracula, in this version of the story, can still be frightening, sinister, seductive, manipulative and intimidating and yet masterfully balanced with sympathy, compassion and romance for the character. For this reason I have to say it has the best portrayed Dracula in... well... ever.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dracula : dead and loving this.,"For me this is simply an amazing film. Having been a big fan of the novel it was refreshing to see someone go back to basics and create a film that sticks as closely to the book as possible. In much the same way Peter Jackson nailed the look and feel of the Lord of the Rings books (even if you do have doubts about his storytelling) Coppola has, for me, nailed the mood and atmosphere of the Bram Stoker classic.The story needs no elaborating on. What is worth mentioning is the stunning performance by Gary Oldman as the man himself. Bringing an element to the character seldom scene (except maybe in the Nosferatu films) you begin to almost sympathise with this evil creature. Thats quite a feat! Anthony Hopkins is one of my favourite actors and his casting as Van Helsing was inspired. What wasn't quite so clever in my opinion was the bizarre decision to cast Keanu Reeves as Harker. The guy is so wooden that two more of him should be planted if he is ever chopped down.A lot of people complained that the horror took a back seat in this film. True maybe, but it still contains a lot of creepy and downright horrifying scenes. The wolf on board The Demeter, the ""rape"" scene in the garden, the Lucy scene in the tomb, the bat creature and the crucifix etc. More then a lot of other balls out horror films. Not only is it creepy it also looks incredibly lush and boasts a Gothic atmosphere not matched in many films, in part thanks to the fantastic music.A must see for fans of the book and horror / Gothic fans everywhere. Its also a film so good anyone can enjoy it. Except those of course who support the notion that Keanu Reeves is a good actor.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Keanu Reeves makes the movie,"This is probably my favorite of all the many, many film adaptations of Stoker's novel I've seen. Despite its slightly psychedelic visuals, Coppola really captures the essential tensions of the text, and if he focuses too much on the Dracula/Mina love story, he is still closer to the action of the book than 90% of the film versions available.But the real winner here is whoever did the casting for this flick. Oldman is suitably snarky as the Count, more dirty-old-man than fiend here, while Rider and Hopkins chew the scenery in most of the right places. But the gem of the bunch, and the actor who really sells me on this version as an accurate adaptation of Stoker's work, is Keanu Reeves.Keanu Reeves, like Jack Nicholson, is strictly a one-trick-pony, acting-wise. For Nicholson, it's the gigglingly violent manic-depressive. He's got the crazy-thang down pat, but whenever he plays any other kind of role he falls right on his butt. For Keanu Reeves, think back to his star-maker, Bill n' Ted's Excellent Adventure. What Keanu Reeves, in all his blow-dried glory, pulls off well is pure California Stoner.Cast him as an action star in The Matrix and you've got crapola, cast him as a Shakespearian villain in Much Ado About Nothing, and it's laughable. But cast him as an everyman who is caught up in Things He Cannot Control, and he pulls it off neatly. Think of his signature line: ""whoah."" It's the mating cry of the laid-back schmuck, run up against something WAY too heavy for him to handle. It's why the only parts of The Matrix that work, acting-wise, are those in which Keanu is dorking around, bumbling from one chaotic nightmare to another, totally over his head. The second he tries to pull off the uber-cool hero schtick, he blows it.Luckily, in Coppola's Dracula, all Reeves has to do is play his best role. Johnathan Harker is Stoker's everyman, a typical English twit, prissy, correct, and utterly devoid of imagination. The whole reason the Count can get away with his invasion of Englan is because Johnathan is too dull to conceive of really cosmic evil. Dracula gives the guy about 400 clues as to his demonic nature, and they just wash over Harker like oil over a goose. Reeves plays that up in the flick...blue flames, giant wolves, people crawling backwards down the walls, and he just goes ""whoah,"" then gets on with arranging paperwork. Pure gold.When you get to Hopkins or Rider's overly-dramatic huffing and puffing, it's almost a let-down from the subtle humor of seeing Ted 'Theodore' Logan trapped in Castle Dracula. Grade: A.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
very very good version,"Have to say it, I wasn't sure I'd like this movie and in fact have been avoiding seeing it for several years.  But, on first viewing - it's terrific.  I have the Lugosi oldie and I love that too and the book also, but this adaptation had beautiful visuals and music, great performances (oh, except Keanu.  Sorry), and was in turn horrific, quite frightening, raunchy, sexy and incredibly moving.  One of those films where at the end you take a moment to come back down to reality.  Never thought I'd rate Winona but she really delivers the goods in this one and of course, another great performance from Gary O in the days before blockbusters were the only time you saw him (damn).  I was impressed by a film that can be so beautiful and so thoughtful and so well done in an age of noisy rubbish full of action and effects.  So 9 out of 10 :)",,Anonymous,Horror
Masterpiece,"I can 't say much more than I regard it as the perfect movie . It is a beautiful Gothic fairy tale . The success is not much due to the script . The plot based of course to Bram Stoker 's book is not very original . The fact that the monster falls in love with a woman who wants to save him is a well known formula . But the direction is so powerful and the actors gave larger than life , poetic performances who enhanced the power of a story and made the film divine kind of an ancient Greek drama . Sometimes overacting is not necessarily bad .The direction is very good on the acting side but I believe that the real kudos will have to go to the technicians : first of all the sets and costumes create a convincing victorial London and a haunted / scary Transylvania . The make ups of Dracula are very good . But the gothic cinematography and music score are the ones which steal the show 70 % of the success of the film is due to the atmosphere which photography and music create . Who can forget the beginning sequence ? Who can forget the marriage scene (with the most intense music I 've ever heard) . Who can forget the finale ? Coppola made a splendid job for the supervision and guidance of those professionalistic jobs . The SFX are credible . One of the greatest charms is that you can 't easily designate who is the lead . The center moves continuusly . The movie starts with Jonathan (Keanu Reeves) who visits the tour of Count Dracula (Gary Oldman) . Then the count comes to London and approaches the beautiful Mina (Winona Ryder) . Mina and Dracula are somehow the focus until the middle of the film Dr Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins) enters and becomes the lead . The acting is uniformly beautiful and very effective . As I said overacting was the only way to give this story the biblical proportions it deserved . Oldman and Ryder are very good , the underrated Keanu Reeves is quite credible (and stop those silly complaints about the bad accent-he IS half British in reality you know) Hopkins is somehow the scene - stealer because his character is wise and funny . Coppola exploited to maximum the make-up facilities and gave all the sides of the vampire with the transformations : the monster , the aggressive hunter , the eternal being , the human who needs love , the loneliness , and the hopeless life of living in the dark . The good direction is also apparent in some contrived (written) scenes which become chilling and powerful .E.g. when Dracula reads the letter and learns that Mina is gone he cries from anger and orders winds to blow. The winds obey and a room full of candles goes to the dark . In the end we have shots of the sunset which are also chilling . If you like romantic stories then stop reading and see it now It is pure masterpiece .10 / 10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Best Film! The Best Film of 1992! Francis Ford Copppla's Best! Even Better than The Godfather!,"The updated version of Dracula is much better than rest because Francis Ford Coppola uses the adaptation in which Bram Stoker used in 1897! Surely this could not have been the 1931 Bela Lugosi version. This version tells us more explcitly about Dracula's diabolique Brides in which lure Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves) so viciously whilst Mina (Winona Ryder)! The best part of the film as I recall was Sexy Lucy Westenra (Sadie Frost)She was at her most humorous when Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins) showed her a crucifix. She broke out in a violent failure overture and then just laid back in her coffin as if nothing happend!! Ha ha ha ha ha! Then she sprayed blood on him, remember the pea-soup in The Exorcist? Most of the film was very steady although the segments with Keanu were very uneven, though the dreary and elaborate sets cover up most of the plot holes.Sadie Frost was immaculate as the naughty red-head Lucy Westenra. Remember Richard E. Grant from ""Henry and June"" his portrayal of the troubled Dr. Seward was ample and important.Keanu was a real wimp and portrayed it well. Again, Anthony Hopkins is another eccentric Doctor. And Winona sparkles as Elisabeta/Mina Murray in this masterpiece!

One of the greatest works of art I have ever seen!,"I am absolutely outraged at some of the reviews I read about this beautiful movie. I can't believe that people said it was boring! How could you think that this movie lacks in story?! And come on, Gary Oldman gave the greatest Dracula performance of any recent vampire movies! He's right up there with Bela Lugosi. The acting in the movie was great! Okay, maybe Keanu Reeves did a bad accent and was miscast. But he was hardly in the movie past the beginning. Winona Ryder was spectacular as Mina. And one thing that I absolutely hated about some reviews was the fact that they say the movie wasn't scary. Of course it wasn't scary, it was a dark romance!The movie was a flat out love story between Dracula and Mina. That's what was so great about the movie. It turned the story of Dracula, a story filled with horror, into a love story.The way the movie was filmed was stunning. The different ways Frances Ford Coppola directs the movie is astounding! The film truly is a work of art.The cast was brilliant. Anthony Hopkins was amazing. Winona Ryder was marvelous. Gary Oldman did such a great performance as the cursed prince, who you actually feel sympathy for as the story goes on. Keanu Reeves was miscast, but he didn't ruin the movie whatsoever.The story was excellent, absolutely excellent. It was great how the story was divided into three parts: 1) Johnathan Harker goes to Castle Dracula and plunges into madness as he discovers the terrifying secrets of the Count. 2) Dracula comes to visit Mina, and they fall in love. 3) Prof. Van Helsing and the main characters hunt down Dracula by train to stop him before he gets to his castle in Transylvania to grow strong again.Bram Stoker's Dracula is one of my favorite movies of all time, and the movie is a grand experience in moviemaking. Everyone should go out and rent it, but don't expect to see a horror movie about an evil vampire, but a tragic love story about a cursed prince and his reincarnated princess falling in love during a very dark and horrifying time.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Francis Ford Coppola's `Dracula' - Bram Stoker is not to blame,"There's no particular reason why a film should be faithful to its source; indeed, the best screen version of `Dracula', the John Badham version of 1979, is not based directly on the novel at all, but on the Edwardian stage play.  And a good thing too.  `Dracula', the novel, consists entirely of primary documents - diary entries, letters, newspaper reports, and the like - arranged in chronological sequence.  This kind of novel REQUIRES surgery when a script is being written.  But Coppola, possibly with an eye to his place in the history books, includes scenes, like the introductory ones in Dracula's castle, that only work in literary form.Apart from including a handful of previously unfilmed scenes - for no very good reason - Coppola's film is remarkably unfaithful to the book.  Yes, this is no sin in itself.  But if Coppola is so foolish as to call his film `Bram Stoker's Dracula' he can hardly complain when critics say, `Well, no, it isn't.'  What riles me is that every change is not only for the worse, but also completely witless.  There are scenes of warfare in the Middle Ages, adding a plot element so utterly at odds with the central story, and so completely out of nowhere, as to render the film ridiculous in the first few seconds.Indeed, Coppola has gone out of his way to make his film ridiculous.  (And yet somehow he seems to take it all so seriously.)  The sometimes-praised LOOK of the film is absurd: not natural, not nineteenth-century, not attractive, not anything.  Dracula has a blob-black shadow that moves with a life of its own.  Why?  It doesn't even yield striking images.  Transylvania is bathed in a ruby-red light that is otherwise only seen in Italian Hercules films.  There are pointless visual references to the fact that the story takes place during the first years of motion picture technology.  Why, yes: the story is also set around same time as the Boer War, but so what?And the acting - oh, the acting.  Anthony Hopkins and Keanu Reeves bellow at each other in unidentified accents as if vying with each other to see who can make the biggest fool of herself. Winona Rider is cast adrift by the script, but I admit she does what she can.  All of Gary Oldman's talent is devoted to transmitting at least SOME sense of character from beneath his ludicrous make-up and Princess Leia hair-do.  This film is not some minor mishap.  It is a major disaster: an enormous bellyflop that drenches us all in stupidity.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
NOT BRAM STOKER'S Dracula!!,"Francis Ford Coppola robots gush about this and that is fine. This movie is NOT Bram Stoker's Dracula. The X's and O's are the same in some spots but the movie's message is just not like the book's. First off, the movie is anti-Catholic church and reaches for the pathetic plot point that Dracula became a dark vampire because of the church and that it was the church's fault. Typical Hollywood to try and attack the church and pass it off as a man's novel, a man who is long since dead and can't defend himself. Second, the ridiculous plot that has Mina being Dracula's long lost soul mate is also not in the book. That this movie can't follow a simple point that Dracula is the villain and not the hero, as the movie maintains, is pathetic. The movie is manipulative, Hollywood bilge. By the way, the scenes of beastiality (Dracula ""giving it"" to Lucy are also not in the book.In the book, Dracula merely drains Lucy and is his typical ""man dressed in black self."" Mina and Lucy kissing are also not in the book. This movie is NOT Bram Stoker's Dracula in that the message is closer to hardcore pornography then Stoker's God loving novel. If Hollywood wants to produce this weird mess than that is fine as that is it's choice. But saying that it is Bram Stoker's Dracula when it clearly is not is nothing but cheap plagiarism. The movie is nicely filmed otherwise but Winona Ryder is awful and confused here. Gary Oldman is great but Hopkins' Van Helsing is a goof and an outsider.

Gary Oldman,"I totally agree with other commentators. This is acting at it's best. Gary Oldman has always been one of the finest actors that ever graced the cinematic screen, and as Dracul/Prince Vlad he has no peers. Vlad is so sensuous he could make female viewers swoon, this female viewer in any case. This was like looking into another's most precious memories, frame for frame, Gary dominated the view, regardless of who was there with him. I found it hard to take my eyes off of him. Winona was delicate it is true, but the scope of her acting was enhanced by her foil, Gary. She truly seemed to be a woman in thrall of her deepest emotions, unable to escape. Mina honestly made it seem as if the princess' spirit had been re-born in herself, and that the love she felt for her prince had not, and could not ever die. Prince Vlad, soon re-awakened in Mina the spirit of Elisabeta that had been dead for centuries, and recaptured her affections, those that had once belonged only to Johnathan. The interaction made it seem natural, and their love, a natural consequence of their meeting. Even with some events that were so horrible, such as the prince giving the baby to his hags to feed upon, had no effect on diminishing his appeal. As the ancient and wizened Count, there shown out a captivating radiance that was mesmerizing in itself. This happened to be the third or fourth time I watched this film, and yet, it was as if I were watching it for the first time. This film had some of the best characterizations by the actors I have ever seen. Cary Ewels was perfect as Holmwood, the proper English Gentleman. Bill Campbell was very masculine and handsome as the American cowboy, Quincey Morris, loyal friend, and brave combatant to the end. Richard E. Grant was wonderful as the obsessed doctor Seward, trying to help his insane patients with all his might, his gauntness lending a touch of reality to his dedication to his work. Tom Waits, perfectly insane, and thoroughly devoted to his master, as Renfield, 'til he looks Beauty in the face. What a backstabber! Sadie Frost, exactly what you'd expect from the rich d√©butante aristocratic, Lucy. Prim and proper outwardly, inwardly a wanton slut, aching to be set free. Then there was the maniacal way that Anthony Hopkins portrayed the world famous vampire hunter, Van Helsing!! That was worth the price of the ticket, right there. Driven mad by his quest to destroy the evil Dracula, led him to using such terminology as ""The devil's bitch"", when he was speaking of Lucy to her husband to be, and Morris. Such scenes were hilarious, and well placed. Brilliantly acted out also, by the incomparable Mr. Hopkins. I say, if this was the world Bram Stoker envisioned, or even more, actually lived in, I'd have to say that they must have had one grand Ole lusty time at that!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Seductive, romantic, splendid!","I don't know why so many people are saying the film is bad because it's not (according their opinion) strictly accordant to the book, or to the Vampire mythos (according their opinion; I disagree myself). The question is about the film, not the book. Seductive, romantic, splendid! Oldman is really good; noble and mysterious, dark and melancholic, romantic and dangerous together. And Winona Ryder as Mina... Oh, my beloved actress, and in this role... so suitable, adorable, the woman whom everyone would desire to... bite, and love forever! A cinematographic masterpiece! I give 10 out of 10, because of the emotion and thrill gave to me, regardless if it is or not enough scary as a horror film (who cares? go and see splatters if so).",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
This movie is actually pretty good!,"I grow tired of reading all the criticism this movie has received on this site about how this movie isn't really Bram Stoker's Dracula.If anyone did their research well, you'd know that Bram Stoker based his novel on a real life person named Vlad Tepes.Bram Stoker visited the real Transylvania which is located in Romania, this city and country as well as the story of Vlad Tepes became the inspiration for Bram Stokers novel ""Dracula""I will explain who Vlad Tepes was for those of you who do not know who Vlad Tepes was.Vlad Tepes was a warrior, a very bloodthirsty warrior who was known for his brutal methods of torture, in fact he acquired quite a nickname for himself, Vlad The Impaler, he is also known as Vlad Dracula.Vlad was imprisoned for a while, he drank the blood of rats while in his cell, when freed he would fight again.The Turks eventually killed Vlad Tepes in Battle, decapitating him. The head of Vlad Tepes was put on display on a stake. The body of Vlad Tepes disappeared, one theory is that perhaps the Turks burned his body after taking his head, another theory is that his body was buried but stolen, the third theory is what spurned the myth of Count Dracula.Eventually The Head of Vlad Tepes disappeared as well. To this day neither the head nor the body of Vlad Tepes have been recovered.Francis Ford Coppola attempted to combine History with Fiction in his version of Dracula.This film remains true to the book for the most part, however Coppola gives us more background on the Character of Dracula himself, using the theory that Dracula is Vlad Tepes resurrected.This film took home one academy award if I am not mistaken. Coppola did not disrespect the book at all. The changes Coppola made were in fact for the better not the worst.",,Anonymous,Horror
An excellent love story,"This is a very good movie, and an excellent love story. Gary Oldman is Dracula. Whenever I hear the Name Dracula now I will think of Oldman not Lugosi. This monster is quite different than any Dracula seen before, he changes shape at whim. Winona Ryder plays ""Mina"", and you can't help but fall in love with her. Watch Dracula's shadow,great special effects,excellent sound, and fantastic costume/makeup. The only flaw that we found with this movie is; Dracula is so powerful how does he pass up the numerous chances to kill his pursuers,he has ample opportunity to take them all out. I have watched this movie about 40 times and still see things that I didn't notice before. Good job to all involved with this fine, fine movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dracula beloved !,"I have seen this rendition of the classic Bram Stoker's Gothic vampire novel. About the infamous Count Dracula Copola's vision really captured the dark essence of the story! I found it to be the best rendition ever, Gary Oldman's portrayal was incredible he really brought a chill down my spine. He was that terrifying, in this disturbing love triangle, of a beautiful young woman Mina (Winona Ryder), her handsome fianc√© Jonathan (Keanu Reeves) and Dracula (Oldman)! The acting was fantastic by all, including Van Helsing( Hopkins ). This movie had it all, romance, death, vampires and other creatures of the night! And bloodshed ! The ultimate horror love story of all time! This is my daughter's take on this movie.Iam the one that told her,about this movie.I knew that she would love it as much,as I do.The love trio,between them is twisted yet some how hauntingly beautiful.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
