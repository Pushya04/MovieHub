Entertaining,"I waited a long time to write this review. I liked the film a great deal but I'm not so sure everyone will. It is entertaining in the way of old fashioned entertainment. Other people in the theater I attended liked it a lot also. That was easy to ascertain by the loud comments both during and after the film.The story, itself, is a little shallow, mainly it's there as a means to fill in the space in between the elaborate musical numbers. However, the story is enough for the vehicle it carries, happy ending and all.Cher, as the club owner Tess, has top billing but the entire show is undoubtedly Christina Aguilera as country-girl turned burlesque performer Ali. I'm old enough to say that in my life I've seen most of the premiere singing performers of modern times, many in live concert. Little Christina Aguilera is not just in a class by herself. Ms. Aguilera is in another universe, perhaps even another dimension. Her voice has a tonal quality, a power and a range that is nothing short of staggering. But the best part is that she knows how to make fullest use of that magnificent instrument.Every second that Christina Aguilera is on screen she is absolutely riveting. You can't take your eyes off of her; and not just because she's remarkably beautiful. Here she is in this film, surrounded by a good number of extremely beautiful and talented women, yet they all seem to fade into the background fog when she is on. She has something more than beauty. She radiates raw animal magnetism and positively smolders in some kind of unidentifiable sexual power that just plain overshadows everything around her. In short, this film is well worth watching just for Aguilara's screen time.If you can tear yourself away from watching Christina, there is more here to see. All the participants turn in great performances. All the dancers surrounding her are talented and wonderful to watch. All together they create very memorable entertainment. Kristen Bell as Nikki and Julianne Hough as Georgia are great but it's Bell who is the surprise. Being so used to seeing her as the usual blonde adornment in romantic comedies she surprised me with her dancing talent. She's really good. And, Hough is a given in a dancing costume; as flawlessly great as she is beautiful.For me, the performance I enjoyed the most other than Christina's was Stanley Tucci as Sean. Mr. Tucci is a great talent who adds character and charm to everything he does and he won't disappoint anyone here.I saved any negatives for last and none have anything to do with the cast. I found I didn't like the sound the way it was presented. The techniques they used tended to make the performances almost look like they were all canned/lip synced. I'm sure they thought the vocals had more power the way they did them but it truthfully detracted from the overall presentation.The decision to make a PG-13 rated film was, no doubt, made to try and capture the kiddie ticket buyers. I honestly feel that if they actually pulled out the stops and made an honest R rated film with a more adult slant it would have been better and more profitable in the long run. To me, trying to make anything called ""BURLESQUE"" anything other than an adult film just seems ludicrous on the face of it.In spite of the negatives it's still entertaining. I'll take friends to see it with a clear conscience.By Bruce L. Joneshttp://webpages.charter.net/bruce.jones1/",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Entertaining,"At times I can be a bit snobby about movies. I am more attracted to slow artsy fartsy movies that try make grand points about society or existence. However, not all movies are to meant to challenge social structures or deliver underlying meanings and here there certainly is none of that.... and I liked it!Burlesque is a little cheesy, yup, filled with clichés, uh huh, predictable, you betcha! That is all part of it's charm though. It set out to be a fun romp with some sexy outfits and entertaining song numbers and it delivered. There is no great villain, there is no great backstabbing - which in someways is more realistic. It doesn't try to have an overly deep plot. It knows it's superficial and embraces it. Did anyone ever doubt Christina could sing? Her voice is amazing and her acting ain't bad either. Cher is well, Cher and how can anyone not love her? Stanley Tucci certainly steals the show while Cam Gigandet provides some delicious eye candy. If you want to be visually and audibly entertained for about an hour and a half, shut your brain off, sit back and enjoy Burlesque. Disclaimer: this recommendation does not pertain to men, unless you are a man of the Cher-loving variety. Despite a burlesque club technically being a 'strip club' this movie is certainly geared for the ladies.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Can I Have Some Mustard With That Ham ??,"Cliche ridden and amateurishly written, ""Burlesque"" still has a talented cast who gives it the ""old college try"" and does their best to elevate the material. Cher and Stanley Tucci, both usually excellent in their acting roles, really ham it up here, probably because that was the only way they could make their silly dialogue seem somewhat interesting. Christina Aguilera looks like she graduated from the Dakota Johnson school of acting, which isn't saying much. Among the others, Eric Dane does manage to come across with his acting dignity intact, but he is not given enough screen time. The sole saving grace is the dance numbers which are very entertaining. All in all, not a bad movie to sit through while you are eating a long lunch during the weekend. Just whip up a ham sandwhich with lots of spicy mustard, grab a soda pop and a bag of chips, and go for it. The only real way to get through this one.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Great cast, great songs, great costumes, why do people hate this movie?","i have just watched this movie for the first time today, and I must say that I don't understand why I listened to the other reviews. All I heard was that the acting was horrible and the story was bland and so on. I will say that the opening scene is a bit too empty, but then Christina starts singing and you forget all about it. The cast is amazing: for the guys we have Christina Aguilera, Kristen Bell, Julianne Hough, Chelsea Traille and the rest of the girls, even Dianna Agron; for the ladies we have Eric Dane and of course the sculptured Cam Gigandet; of course we can't forget about the acting powerhouse that is Stanley Tucci playing the gay best friend that every woman wishes she had (especially if he is that good looking); and we can't forget about Peter Gallagher and Alan Cumming. There is a lot more eye candy from all the boys that work at Burlesque. The story is somewhat predictable but I find that the way it is told, between music and extra little drama in the background, makes it perfect. Just hearing Christina Aguilera singing is enough to carry the story along. Cher has a solo about halfway through the movie that brings you back to one of the main issues in the background which makes for a very powerful solo thanks to that story and the power of Cher's voice makes it even more dramatic. The writing is exquisite due to a main reason, it is perfectly real. It is not full of extra fluff and puff just to create some kind of big moment. It has lots of funny in it, but very subtle . Bottom line is, the script is simple, to the point and every line sounds like something you would hear somebody say in real life. Many films have all that dialogue that you know nobody would ever say but it makes for those big moment, but the simplicity in this movie is what makes me like it so much. It is a simple film, with an amazing cast, that I believe has been completely overlooked. I have a theory as to why it has been overlooked...the marketing for it wasn't very good, it only focused on Cher and Christina and it made very little reference to any of the other amazing people in it or even to the story. The trailer makes it sound like it is all about the dancing and sining, but there is an actual story behind it all. The love story is only partially shown on the trailer, there isn't even one image of Eric Dane or Peter Gallagher, there is too much information about the dancing part as well, I personally think they should have left a little mystery on the dancing and singing and added some more of the story into it.That's just what I think. Enjoy.",,Anonymous,Music
Almost Bob Fosse,"The musical numbers reminded me of ""Sweet Charity"" and the camera moves around the Kit Kat Klub style room like Fosse's camera did in ""Cabaret"" The similarities stop there. The film is a brave attempt but the writing walks a very, very thin line. Was Steve Antin trying to be funny? Some of the lines were received with loud guffaws and there is no way to know if that was the intention because, personally, I felt like cringing. Never mind. It was fun. Christina has a powerful voice but not film presence and Cher is a fearless icon but she had so little to show for it. The best performance is, without question, by Stanley Tucci. The songs work at the moment you're watching them being performed but I couldn't hum a tune now, 48 hours later, for the life of me. So, I was entertained and in the big scheme of things, I guess that's enough",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Great musical numbers, costumes and set design, mediocre acting","When going to watch Burlesque you first have to know a few things:1.) You are watching this movie, knowing the acting isn't going to be great, but to see great musical numbers and fantastic costumes.2.) The acting is partially terrible because of the cliche ridden but not mind-numbing storyline, and corny writing.3.) Cher is great, but understanbly only contributed two songs. Would have loved to see more Cher action, but she hadn't recorded original songs for 7 years. She is also aging, gracefully, but aging nonetheless. This movie was made for Christina Aguilera.4.) Christina Aguilera. I have a love/hate relationship with her musical career, but you cannot deny the power of her voice in this film and just in general. Her range, control, vibrato and power are just astounding and really shine in the musical numbers. She also looks fantastic here, and does a great job of playing a believable small-town girl trying to make it big.4.) Stanley Tucci is a national treasure, and is delightful throughout the film with most of the best lines. The whole cast did a great job as well, but Stanley Tucci is great at playing these types of rolls and you can tell he has total fun with it.This movie is great if you like musicals and don't mind sitting through a cute but predictable storyline. As a seamstress I am in love with the costumes, particularly the green silk dress Christina wears 3/4 of the way through the film. It's dramatic, got a really beautiful built in corset, and with the minimal makeup, hair and jewelry she is transformed into a goddess.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Great music decent story,Christina Aguilera and Cher signing tunes in the same film has to be tough to top. The tunes are all pretty great and the storyline is pretty good too. Anyone a fan of Christina's and musicals will love this.,7.0,Anonymous,Music
Christina and Cher Still Got It... Do You Want It?,"Imagine Chicago and Cabaret with none of the social commentary but all of the sexy, flashy fun. This movie is ""almost"" that.All great musicals have songs that help to push the story forward. This is not one of them. This movie has a lot more in common with Coyote Ugly and Flashdance. Flashdance especially. Not saying I didn't enjoy myself. On top of the 4 songs that actually do push the story forward, there are really some awesome pieces that just need to be seen to be believed. When the camera isn't cutting away from the dances, some real magic happens. Even Cam Gigandet gets to do a little striptease that has to be seen to be believed. Some of the lead-ins to the musical numbers were very unnecessary. When a movie opens with Christina Aguilera wailing away to cut away scenes burlesque dancers she has yet to meet, and follows with Cher wailing away with those very dancers, I think it's safe to say that if anyone is still in the theater, they get that these two ladies will sing and dance.Christina Aguilera plays Ally who escapes from her small town life to Hollywood and finds herself in a club called ""The Burlesque Lounge"" which has an exterior that resembles a gay youth center I used to frequent as a teen. There she meets the owner of the club Tess (Cher), her gay companion Sean (Stanly Tucci), a sexy metro bartender (Cam Gigandet) and the star of ""The Burlesque Lounge,"" the villainous yet redeemable Nikki (an underused Kristen Bell).There should be no doubt about Cher's acting ability. This woman went through Moonstruck, Mermaids and Tea with Mussolini. She's an actor people. Christina Aguilera really surprised me with her portrayal of Ally. I thought what she did with the character was very real and honest and I can only imagine how hard that is to do with all the flashy set pieces and costumes flying about.Director and writer Steven Antin (Robin Antin's brother) really has to be praised for just diving into this material. Musical movies can be really tricky and this movie in particular straddles a fine line between movie musical and movie with music in it. A weak script full of clichés, one too many montage scenes and a rushed third act really might put a damper on this movie, but the little homages to Cabaret (Alan Cummings in a featured cameo for example) and the awesome choreography really help lift the movie past mediocre.Definitely watch if you love the burlesque style of dance, Christina and Cher, and if not... well you read this far, I think you can safely decide. Or...... you can buy the soundtrack.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Camp,"I love camp. I love stupidity. My only stipulation is that a campy movie shouldn't pretend to be smarter than it is. And thankfully, this one doesn't. I'm not going to say this is a great, well-made movie, but I will say that it's entertaining. Some of the time.Any of the scenes in the club, including the musical numbers, are pure dumb fun, and I love every second of it. The acting isn't good and I don't care; if anything, that adds to it. There are plenty quotable lines, too. I will say that I wish Cher did a little more singing in it, but I can get past that.My problem with this movie is that when it's not a full-blown camp extravaganza, it's boring. Anything having to do with Christina Aguilera's boyfriend or personal life is just dreadfully, painfully boring, and I'm just begging to get back to the good stuff.To summarize: If you want a professional, well-constructed story, this isn't it. If you want brainless fun and like this sort of thing, this is it.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Burlesque!,"This film is about a small town girl from Iowa who goes to Los Angeles to pursue her dreams of dancing and singing.""Burlesque"" is very enjoyable on many levels. The costumes and sets are dazzling, and the dances are great. The moves are seductive but not erotic, and I commend the choreographers for getting this fine balance right. Christina Aguilera has always been known for her powerful voice, and in ""Burlesque"" her voice and singing skills are brilliantly displayed.In some films, the abundance of songs can make the film like an extended music video, or is awkward or forced. In ""Burlesque"" there is no such problem. The speaking scenes and singing scenes transit smoothly from one another. Another thing I really like about this film is the witty lines, they made me laugh so many times! I never thought ""Burlesque"" could be so good, I think it should have made a lot more in the box office.",,Anonymous,Music
All That Fosse,"BURLESQUE sets itself up for some fairly blunt 2011 criticism for it's lame storyline but if one knows their films of the 30s to the 70s, you can see they type of nightclub musical it wants to be. If BURLESUE was made in the 30s it would be a Warner bros Vitaphone musical like 42nd STREET or FOOTLIGHT PARADE. Christina Aguelira would be played by Joan Blondell who she actually resembles. Cam Gigandet would be James Cagney. Cher vs Mae West. Hop into the 40s and we might have Rita Hayworth as Cher, Berry Grable as Christina, and called COVER GIRL or PIN UP GIRL, or if you prefer staying in a cheaper locale THE SWING PARADE OF 1946, Monogram's big nightclub musical mess starring Gale Storm and performers in a finale who did not appear anywhere else in the whole film. In the 50s, well just have a look at either PAL JOEY or THE GIRL CAN'T HELP IT. The opening 5 minutes of BURLESQUE resembles the 1965 Elvis credit sequence on a bus in TICKLE ME. BURLESQUE really really wants to be all of the fabulous nightclub scenes from SWEET CHARITY... the scenes where Charity meets Vittorio and sees the RICH MAN'S FRUG dance numbers with awesome Barrie Chase and her 10' legs and whopper hair. Now that we are in Fossey territory, add some CABARET (in fact, a lot of CABARET), mix in MOULIN ROUGE and plenty of CHICAGO and Columbia's B grade subsidiary Screen Gems give us a new B grade nightclub musical with all the above elements called BURLESQUE. This film just wants to be some of all those above. Hell it is far better than NINE and miles ahead of RENT, which for me is just fine. I actually think the 'lets save the nightclub' storyline is a wink to other cliché musicals and knows it. (Boogaloo, anyone?) What is good about BURLESQUE is the hilarious script which has some terrific lines, the excellent rapport between the three leads Cher, C.A and Stanley Tucci... and of course cute Cam as the Paul Newman type love interest. His 'box of cookies' nude scene adds some well timed zing. The dance numbers are thoroughly enjoyable albeit badly edited and filmed too close, like most of the film. The songs good and the costumes offer the old razzle dazzle as well they could and actually do. BURLESQUE knows it is silly and has a great time with it... hey just like an actual BURLESQUE show. Just enjoy. it's not difficult. BURLESQUE might even get Barbra Striesand out of the house to make a new musical given she would see it as her husband James Brolin has a cameo and Cher is her same age: 66. Also finally Cher might get the cash to make the Mae West musical for which she is now ideal. BURLESQUE would make a terrific double feature with Columbia's own 1948 cheapie LADIES OF THE CHORUS starring Marilyn Monroe in the Christina part.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

The grotesque state of the film musical,"The state of American film in the 21st Century has been generally abysmal but nowhere is it more evident than in the film musical. Taking the most honored of the period Chicago, a Fosse wanta be with bad performances and forgettable tunes as the benchmark it is more than evident all singing all dancing has lost its voice and more than a step. The latest entry and every bit the tepid much ado about nothing heat and light display of flaccid musical storytelling as the Oscar winner (an even bigger comment on the unimaginative state of the movie business) is the insipidly slick Burlesque.Stop me if you've heard this. Young impressionable girl with massive hidden talent leaves the land of corn for the bright lights of LA where she stumbles upon a run down anachronism with a crusty but understanding owner still in it for love of the game who gives the kid a break and, well you can fill in the rest.In the role of Judy Garland Christine Aguleria sings the blues with impressive voice but it's all plastic soul and slumming for the former mouseketeer who presents an unintentionally jarring visual context of an Aryan uber babe singing Bessie Smith. Speaking of plastic Cher all polished and waxed like an antique Oldsmobile splits her time offering sage advice and sarcasm. In addition she does a couple of tunes with her signature howl wrapped as always in distracting outfit and opulent stagecraft to soften its blow. There's some male characters whose purpose it seems is to stand around with expressions of awe for the divas and of course the serious pyrotechnics surrounding the noir dance numbers that attempts to put some make-up on this pig but in the end it is all forced Fosse.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
"Ali moves from Ohio to LA, to become a singer/ dancer. Struggeles, deters and surprises everyone with her freshness, talent and loyalties.","Well this movie is amazing. The entire feel is Moulin Rouge meets Sex and the city.From the dances, the costumes, the make up, the hair dos, everything was so freshly daring. The entire look of the movie was so perfect for the entire dramatic effect that this movie required and could easily pull off.Both the actresses, Christina and Cher, were splendid with their vocals and their acting. Although Cher has been seen on and off the silver screen, this was Chistina's first major venture and she sizzled on screen.The only pitfall for the entire movie was its very predictable and very sugary story line. There were no real black moments. Maximum it touched was a few shades of gray.But if you enjoy musicals and have a penchant for dramatics, this is a perfect watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Lofty, dramatic and musically ambitious, but also obvious, lame, and mildly entertaining","Like the name implies, ""Burlesque"" was lofty, dramatic and musically ambitious. Unlike the name, I think it was too serious to be much of a parody of stage-shows. Cher is an actress, an Academy Award winning actress at that, but there was minimal evidence of intentional self-caricaturing.A small-town Iowa waitress pursues her dreams and high-tails it to Los Angeles. Ali has way too much audacity for her own good but it does get her a job, two scrumptious boyfriends, and into the burlesque show. Of course it does. Alice, you are in wonderland now. At least when lines like that are delivered by Stanley Tucci they are pretty funny.The film did have a plot with questions along the lines of: Will Ali realize her dreams of singing and dancing? Will she meet the man of her dreams? And more importantly, will Tess (Cher) save her club from financial ruin? The latter storyline might actually matter if the rest of the film wasn't littered with outlandish sets, costumes and lighting. But ""Burlesque"" is also what it claims to be—entertaining. Well, mildly entertaining. Christina Aguilera can sing, Cher and Stanley Tucci have good comedic chemistry, and Cam Gigandet is one of the hottest young actors around.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Burlesque: The return of the movie-musical!,"When I originally heard of the concept for Steven Antin's Burlesque, a movie musical starring pop phenom Christina Aguilera and the legendary Cher, I was, if you could believe it, less than enthusiastic. I was under the assumption that this film would be not just bad, but god awful. Recalling horrid pop star film debuts (ex. Mariah Carey in the depressingly hollow Glitter, Britney Spears in the mind-numbing Crossroads) I thought I was in for a cinematic train wreck of epic proportions. And I'm happy to tell you today, that I couldn't have been more wrong.First of all, what makes Burlesque unlike Glitter and Crossroads is its aesthetics. Christina Aguilera's strong voice is enough to carry a film, as it turns out. However, Burlesque has more to fall back on. Cher plays Tess, Aguilera's character's boss and mentor. She can make any film excellent. Secondly, this film is a musical, also unlike Glitter and Crossroads. It shoots for being something of a hybrid between Cabaret and Chicago, and doesn't completely fail. Thirdly, this film has an outstanding supporting cast, including the always great Stanley Tucci, Grey's Anatomy vet Eric Dane, Kristen Bell, Cam Gigandet, and Alan Cumming, and these folks bring enough liveliness to save even the worst film, but here, they only add to the fun and excitement.The story is really nothing new. Small-town girl Ali (Aguilera) leaves her job as an Iowan waitress, and heads for the big lights of Los Angeles. She stumbles upon a burlesque club run by Tess (Cher), starts working her way up, and eventually becomes the main attraction, with her intense vocal range and elaborate interpretations of dance numbers, which turns out to be a godsend for Tess, who is about to lose her club. She starts living with the charismatic and sexy bartender Jack (Cam Gigandet), after her apartment gets robbed. Romance ensues, and things go from there.Cliché, right? It's been done before, right? Right. There isn't a section of this film that isn't even a little bit corny. But, that's not to say it's not a load of fun. I'm sorry, Harry Potter, Burlesque is the film event of the Thanksgiving holiday. Christina Aguilera isn't a fantastic actress, but she's better than you would expect her to be, and her song-and-dance numbers, obviously, are fantastic, as one would expect.She and Cher have fantastic chemistry, as well as Cher and Stanley Tucci. All of these actors blend together so well, that they seem to compliment each other, enhancing each performance. And, I was rather disappointed to see that Cher only sang two out of the film's ten musical numbers, but it's safe to say that that's not enough, considering that she can still belt the hell out of these songs. However, Cher's obvious plastic surgeries don't help her performance, considering that her face barely moves throughout the entire picture, but she's still able to pull this role off, somehow.Steven Antin is a director whom I've never heard of, however, I was fairly impressed. The film is directed with impeccable taste, and the writing is very quick and clever, and humorous, even when a little corny.However, what really saves Burlesque in the end is its elaborate song- and-dance numbers. Soon after the movie begins, you know what kind of film you're in for. Even as cliché after cliché presents themselves, Burlesque has enough razzle-dazzle magic to outweigh its faults, and to leave you dancing in the aisles as you leave this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Success is what she dreams of..,"Ali (Aguilera) decides to leave everything behind and go to find some luck in LA. She mets Tess (Cher) owner of a burlesque lounge club, who needs a new, exciting show to keep the place from going down. Here Ali finds a place for herself, and she's becoming the star of the show, thanks to her amazing voice and hard work. Unfortunately fantastic performance by Aguilera is not enough to keep the viewer interested in the story line. The movie feels a bit too much like a concert. The story is quite naive and simple. Over all it's quite a nice and easy movie that you can enjoy with your girlfriends, and a must see for the burlesque lovers.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Not great,"If you like Christina Aguilera, you will probably enjoy this movie. If you like movies, you probably won't enjoy this movie.The issue is if you are looking at it objectively as film for watching, it's just not good. There is no drama, no depth, nothing to get you engaged or interested. But Aguilera is super talented - we know this - and I have chosen to factor her singing ability into this rating. Perhaps that isn't right, and instead I can just go and listen to her music separately to enjoy that.Regardless of the music, I was bored. I didn't care for what was happening, what was coming next, and what might happen. And then when what happened happened, I just watched it happen with no reaction.My suggestion: skim the in-between bits (the plot is so predictable it will be easy to pick up) and just listen to the Aguilera bits.

"Sugar, Spice and all things Niche","From seemingly nowhere there has been a recent outburst of interest in all things Burlesque, transmogrified by fashion, dance and other mediums in an attempt to modify the niche into something more commercial and accessible. So it's no surprise that Hollywood would get in on the action with Burlesque (2010) a feature length debut for Christina Aguilera alongside fellow musical behemoth Cher.Stylistically Burlesque is a musical, although luckily there are no spontaneous outbreaks of song and dance except for when Cher decides to sing us a song to signify how fed up she is. Ultimately everything is constructed around the theatre and performance, driven by a collection of music/cabaret video sequences glued together by what turns out to be a fairly interesting set of characters and stories. Centrally we have a little cliché, Ali (Aguilera) is a small town girl from Iowa who decides she wants to leave behind everything to pursue the dreams and promise of Los Angeles. Destiny guides her to would be mentor Tess (Cher) the divorced, struggling owner of a neo-Burlesque club ""The Burlesque Lounge"". Ali becomes enamoured with the club, as well as Jack (Cam Gigandet) a hunky barman whose already complicated love life is thrown into further turmoil when he find himself with Ali as a makeshift roommate.The tagline reads ""It takes a LEGEND... to make a STAR!"" which is sort of embolismic of the Aguilera/Cher partnership, Cher herself has managed to put together a fairly impressive acting career and her young on screen protégé is quite impressive in this debut. We see Ali jumble the juxtapositions of her womanhood, love life, her career and the accompanying emotions they bring to good effect. Christina already has the look of a Hollywood star and the talent is on show here to suggest that she could have a substantial big screen future. Cher does her bit too playing the struggling business woman married to her struggling club which she faces losing, until Ali's hidden singing talents re-energises her club and show. The Sharks are circling meanwhile and Tess must fight them off if the club is to survive, among the predators are an Ex-husband (Peter Gallagher) she must buy out, an aggressive Tycoon (Eric Dane), and the destructive jealousy of her former star pupil (Kristen Bell).There are some problems however, script and resulting dialogue are a little misjudged, often being overly fluffy and cute instead of really taking on some of it's themes with real bite. Hence the message of the film is a little lost somewhere between feminist empowerment and the true nature of Burlesque as an art form, with the latter summed up by the repeated lines ""They're not here to hear us sing"" which appears to fall on deaf ears. As a result Burlesque's audience is a little ambiguous possibly the price to pay when bringing a niche into the mainstream.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Could have been 10 minutes shorter ... but other than that, OK.","And I say that as an old fart who has never particularly liked Christine Aguilera, or her image or brand of pop (am I getting old?).It's not 'Funny Girl' or 'Cabaret', but it's a bit of a mixture of both, with some nice moments for the supporting cast - especially Stanley Tucci, who once again gets to play ""the gay"" in that interesting, undemonstrative style of his - and not much needed from the leads, who do their jobs as required.And if that sounds like a put-down, it's not meant to be. I enjoyed watching the film - it's just not up there with the ones I mentioned. And the business of it being too ""Bob Fosse""-esque? Pah. If you're going to mimic, at least pick the best.My preference would have been for a few more classic lip-synced blues tracks; but at the end of the day, it's a nice story, well told. And it reminded me that, even with all that prodigious female talent on display: It ain't what you got; it's how you use it.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Ooh, Look! Ali's Doing The Wagon-Wheel Watusi!","According to the dictionary, the word ""burlesque"" is defined as being a variety show characterized by low-comedy and striptease.Well, (unless there are 2 versions of this movie out there) this version of Burlesque (with its PG-13 rating) contained neither one of these forms of entertainment. (It might have helped if it did)I guess that the reason behind this film's erroneous and (deliberately) misleading title has something to do with the fact that a word like ""burlesque"" has a very provocative and enticing sound to it.From my point of view, I found Burlesque to be, pretty much, an up-dated, carbon-copy of Flashdance and something of a Cabaret-clone, as well, with the distinctive echoes of Dirty Dancing thrown in for good measure.Burlesque's backstage, backstabbing story was so continually marred by clichés, predictability, dumb dialogue and trite personal dramas that this, in turn, quickly reduced its elaborately staged musical numbers to being nothing more than half-ass fizzle rather than full-throttle sizzle.And speaking about Burlesque's mega-extravagant musical numbers, (when you clearly see the exterior of the building where they were being staged) you'll be quick to realize that there was absolutely no way on Earth that a dinky, little venue like that could ever possibly house these fantastic, ""Vegas""-calibre productions. No way, Jose!Anyways - Besides the fact that the 64-year-old Cher was never filmed in natural daylight (Gee. I wonder why??), Burlesque really killed me with its pretentious and snooty ""I'm-so-classy"" attitude.This picture tried and tired (so earnestly) to firmly establish itself as a real class act. But, hey, once the glitzy trinkets and shiny tinsel got stripped away it was nothing but cheap and petty story-telling right to its very core.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Pleasantly surprised,"I can easily summarize this film into short sentences. This film has everything, everything but a plot that is. What you should expect from Burlesque is almost two hours of high powered entertainment. Burlesque is just that, entertaining. If you are going to this film to witness a great storyline unfold don't go see this film. However, if you want to be entertained with great vocals from Christina Aguilera and Cher in addition to great acting from Peter Gallagher, Stanley Tucci, Alan Cummings, and again Cher then this film is a must see. I must say prior to the screening that I attended, I was very apprehensive that I was going to see a product that resembled a ""Nine"" / ""Coyote Ugly"" blend of a film, but I was certainly wrong. Burlesque holds itself above the rest of the films in its category. The film obviously cost a lot to produce and I believe that the money was well spent. Cher's performance was excellent. Say what you want about the person, but the actress conveys a confidence level in front of the camera as though she has done this a hundred times. Stanley Tucci is also quite merit worthy in this film. His performance in ""Lovely Bones"" is still haunting and his role as Cher's right-hand gay best friend/costume designer in this film just shows what incredible range this actor has. The costume design, casting, choreography and set design for this film are also worthy of mention. You can count on this film definitely being nominated in the Best Film in Comedy or Musical category for the Golden Globes in December. This film will also do incredibly well at the box office. I would have no problem watching this film again.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
dance songs and Christina !!!,"""Burlesque"" Oh Christina ! The voice, energy and beauty in one filigree body ! Story is simple – a girl comes to LA to make a carrier !Lots of song et cetera. I have noticed that during Alice's ""audition"" there is as a backdrop a collage of Tamara Lempicka (POLISH great artist)painting. 'Adam&Eve' – once belonging to Barbara Streisand a remarkable artist of POLISH descend too. Keep on dancing and singing C!She is such a great even though being filigree but her voice is power. Cher long time not seen this still is a woman to watch.All but all I spent a pleasant time watching it.More pleasant to listen to all songs included in it.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Ugh. Uggghh. I don't like it.,"Ugh I really didn't like it. There are some positives. The dance routines are pretty cool, the dancers do a good job. The costumes and make up are nice. So the costume and make up designers get a thumbs up from me along with the choreographer. Besides that, oh boy. The script is pretty meh, the story is really predictable. Like really predictable. In fact it's kind of just Coyote Ugly except worse. I didn't like the main character Ali at all. She's probably the least amiable main character I've seen since Psycho. She's just obnoxious, rude and mean. I know she's supposed to come off as this strong young independent woman and I love that type of characters. But come on. This is a film about a woman whose only aspirations is to dance provocatively. I have absolutely nothing against doing that. But the film makes it look like she's striving for the Nobel peace price or something.Jack, the main male love interest, absolutely deserves her. Are we supposed to feel so sorry for him for being in a long distance relationship with a girl who values her carrier that we deem it okay for him to cheat on her? Don't get me wrong. His girlfriend is conveniently horrible. But still. And the stuff he says just in general. The ""want a cookie?"" line (delivered by Jack standing naked next to Ali with a box of cookies to hide... him) made me dry heave profusely. The ""You're definitely not gay"" post-coital sentence from Ali produced a similar reaction. Like... what is this film? Who is writing these scenes and those dialogues?Oh and I hate the sound mixing. Why do everybody sound like they're singing in a studio all the time? Even when singing on stage without a microphone? Like the scene where Nikki turns the sound system off whilst Ali is singing and they just freeze, but then Ali steps up and sings the vocals herself. She's supposed to be singing completely unsupported, not even a mic, but she sounds positive autotuned. It just takes you out of the film. It's rather ironic when Ali is this great rebel fighting for the girls to sing themselves instead of miming.I'm sorry, I've gone on a complete rant. It's just such an overrated film. Bottom point being, just watch Coyote Ugly.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
"Excellent, sexy, electrifying film","Burlesque achieved absolute greatness! I am a huge Cher fan, so naturally I just had to see this movie. Cher blew it away here, not only with her magnificent voice, but also with her acting! I saw where Cher was nominated for a Razzie for this film........ I don't know what those Razzie people were on when they decided that, or maybe they just didn't watch the movie, that's probably it! I didn't know a thing about Christina Aguilara before this movie, and now I can say I am a big fan! Her acting was spot on, her dancing was very sexy and exciting! Every burlesque dancer was unbelievably great and always spot on with their performances! Stanley Tucci handled his character wonderfully. I loved how they showed Tess's relationship with Sean, a very sweet and close friendship. And then there's Cam, I LOVED his character! There couldn't have been a better love interest! He was very sweet, friendly, warm and above all---sexy!! As the main love interest should be! The music was so electrifying! The dance moves were perfect! The whole film was just soo entertaining and enjoyable! Get your ass up, show me how you Burlesque! ;)",9.0,Anonymous,Music
And this is the Burlesque I expected.,"I loved this movie, watched it more than a few times. It's great music, GREAT singing, two remarkable divas, unless you count Stanley Tucci who's a doll in this role, so that makes three. This is the behind-the-scenes movie I had once expected with Moulin Rouge. I love live theater, and this gave it in handfuls. Sure, it could have been more, and Alan Cumming should have had more though his moments on screen were priceless.It's burlesque, it's naughty, it's back-biting and it's where music and dreams collide.Just the fab musical numbers won me over, Christina Aquilera's singing was fabulous and Cher's solo worth admission.The love story was a little too drawn out and the film sagged in the middle from, but the rest, was fun, lively and did I say it before, Great Music.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Better Than Expected,"I went to see this movie with a friend at the cheap movie theater because we had nothing better to do. Before we went in we warned ourselves that this movie had been getting horrible reviews. I must say we were both pleasantly surprised and impressed with the movie as a whole. It is not great by any means but it is enjoyable and does not deserve the ridicule it gets. It's not West Side Story but it also isn't Glitter. Christina was about average on the acting scale, enough for me to enjoy her performance. Like Crossroads, it is clear that Burlesque was written for Christina Aguilera; and like Crossroads it gets a bad wrap. The ending was a cliché, Hollywood Happy Ending scenario, but that still didn't take a way from the fantastic performances, gorgeous costumes, and pleasant story. The romance between Christina and her leading man was fake as h--- to easy and would never happen; but whatever it made me smile. I would highly recommend you see the film yourself before judging.",,Anonymous,Music
"Entertaining Performances, Flabby Story","What sticks with you from this movie is what a good singer Christina Aguilera really is. She polishes off ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend"" in better voice than Marilyn Monroe. The plot of the film is cliché-ridden, and no one who really performed in burlesque would recognize any of this as burlesque. But that is not the point. The reason to see this is to get a glimpse at what makes Aguilera so popular and to see how Cher's latest plastic surgery is holding up. As a story, it is predictable, but it takes some effort to produce so old-fashioned a musical in the 21st century, and Cher fans (of which I am one) will adore her singing ""You Haven't Seen the Last of Me."" ---from Musicals on the Silver Screen, American Library Association, 2013",7.0,Anonymous,Music
I liked it,"I am giving it a six because of Christina Aguilera.Essentially an Aguilera video with a cliché of a story line to join the music it was competently done. Good dance routines and pleasant music which became repetitive toward the end. Aguilera's electrifying voice kept my attention throughout.Stanley Tucci carries on with his role in The Devil Wears Prada, even to the extent of casually flipping costumery over his shoulder at the young protagonist (Aguilera in this case) whilst delivering witty repartee.Cher wailed like a stuck pig in some of her numbers. I don't believe that her singing added value as CA swept all before her. It's difficult to compete with Aguilera's power. Not many solo artists today could follow her act.I am not competent enough to comment on Cher's acting performance but she was believable in the simple (beleagured) role.Aguilera gives an honest and energetic performance. I think she is a lovely girl and that is exactly what she plays in this picture. Nothing spectacular. I bought her story as simple as it was. Some bitchy comments seemed to be out of character later in the movie after she gains a measure of fame.When CA opens her mouth to sing, I shut mine and listen.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Burlesque,"What I love most in this movie is its dancing and singing. The two songs-""I am a good girl"" and ""Express"" that Christina performed really gave me a big shock. I think it is worthy to watch for its songs and dancing. I also love its costumes and luxurious settings which made me feel exciting. All in all, I think this movie is a great choice to kill time. I think as the first time for a singer to try acting, Christina has already tried her best to use her talent on singing and dancing to make the film better; though it still needs a lot of improve on her acting, I think she chose the right film which can show her merits and it is more easier for her to play the role of Ali who is similar to her profession.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Best performance by a wax mannequin ever.,"Where to start when reviewing ""Burlesque""? What's the sound of one hand clapping? I caught this turgid exercise in tedium wrapped around Cher and Xtina Aguilera on cable the other night. ""Burlesque"" revives a plot that was old in the 1930s. Kid from nowhere shows up in the big city, reveals a hot set of pipes, and voilà, instant stardom! Usually this sort of malarkey starred Ruby Keeler, but since she's long dead, Xtina takes her place. Warner Baxter, he of the famous line ""You're going out there a youngster, but you've got to come back a star!"" (from ""42nd Street"" 1933), is also long dead, so Cher takes his place.Every cliché imaginable occurs here. Evil supposed star of the show who plots to overthrow the ingénue, sassy gay backstage manager, hot boyfriend, impending financial doom, instant last-minute solution to the whole financial problem, love conquers all, roll credits. Also many, many terrible musical numbers featuring the vocal prowess of Xtina. This woman never met a song she didn't beat into submission. This is urban yodeling at it's finest. All songs sound alike, featuring a cast of dozens on splashy sets using Faux Fosse moves. Hey, isn't this theater in financial ruin? Where is the money coming from to put on these huge numbers? Evidently, you aren't supposed to think about this.Which brings us to Cher, giving the best performance ever by a wax dummy. Yes, she's an icon. She has an Oscar, legions of fans, makes a comeback every two years, and could easily be replaced in this movie by that unused flesh-colored Crayola that sits in the back of the box. One would think that after losing all her Oscar credibility by doing that infamous series of hair care product infomercials, she would have picked better material for a return to the screen. She's given a series of snappy lines that she sleepwalks through, and a really forgettable power ballad to warble. This is a sad situation for Cher, since anyone who paid to see this in a theater went to see her, not Xtina.So, the state of the American movie musical remains comatose. Everyone involved here seems to have gone into hiding, except for perky Stanley Tucci, who's now embarked on a career path of playing snappy gay characters, and Cher, who went back to Vegas for the 1,000,000 time.",3.0,Anonymous,Music

It was painful to watch her do her best at her advanced age.The rest of the cast were treated as redundant bodies thrown on the screen at random.Anyone who has seen Strictly Ballroom, Cabaret or the Blue Angel would wonder how they could make a cabaret flick so boring, so silly and so sexless with so much nudity!",1.0,Anonymous,Music

A whole new level of Turkey!,"This film should never have left somebody's to-do list! Cher would have been fab – had she not tried desperately to look 20 (really?). Can you imagine how great she would have been if she looked her real age, with at least a few wrinkles, and lips that do not resemble bagels stuck to her teeth. And miss Aguilera really needs to fire all her hair and makeup people and get herself a personality. Her look in the movie is so schizophrenic that you finally aren't quite sure if it is her, or a new cast member appearing in every scene. The end result is as if someone taped together an endless loop of different music video tryouts... Save your money and revisit ""Cabaret"". That film got it right.

Bad movie with split personality,"This is a lousy movie with some of the worst, most utterly hackneyed writing in the history of movies, but what makes it stand out as particularly ill-conceived is that the story is Rocky/""Hey kids, let's do a show,"" while the production numbers are faux Bob Fosse. Consequently, the numbers have nothing to do with the story, or vice versa. Started badly when the heroine gave her buddy at the bar money to buy a bike for the buddy's kid, then ran down one cliché to another till it ended 4 or 5 hours later.Cher and Aguilara sang well, but this isn't MTV, and as a movie it was awful.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
Let Me Entertain You,"Burlesque may have started out as a dazzling, lip-sync singing French twist sensation but when a talented girl from a small town takes center stage belching out loud piercing notes screaming with soul, ""You know something got a hold of you and won't let go.""The director starts out with scenes in dingy, crusty locations, overshadowed with filtered sunlight to create an outdated, old fashion look. These scenes failed to capture a unique cinematic vision, instead the views were dark and dull. His blend of melodrama and music worked better than Chicago because singing was sung only on stage. No phantom of the opera to bring tears, just a busting out movie that went straight to the point--I want to sing!Ms small town girl named Ali, played by Christina Aguilera, changed cities but couldn't quite change her waitress uniform. She worked her way to that familiar job, when charmed by neon lights, she opened the door to a new world, Welcome to Burlesque. As she looked around, she watched the bickering and cat fights among the dancers and how shamefully patrons weren't getting their drinks. So, she took charge by befriending Jack the bartender played by Cam Gigandet, then moved from the unemployment line to waiting on tables and serving drinks. Tess, the club owner played by Cher, told her she has great enthusiasm and terrible timing. However, in the midst of all this tension whiplash, Tess told Ali to take off her coat and get to work.Ali studied hard by reading every burlesque book ever written. She demonstrated a fierce determination that she could do every dance, every scene, step by step better than the other girls at the audition . She was impressive and landed the job. Now here's the catch 22, people pay to see the dancers lip sync to the great stars like Marilyn Monroe's ""Diamonds are a Girls Best Friend."" There is no live singing at Burlesque. What is a girl to do with all that vocal talent? Well, she could be lucky to have a vengeful enemy like Nikki who turns off the pre-recorded music during her lip sync stage performance. Surely for Nikki that has to be the biggest mistake, huge mistake, right? Right. So the rest, as they say, is history! Tess rewrites the whole show around Ali's voice and the small town girl is now center stage on Hollywood Sunset Stripe.Cher's performance was better than great, it was awesome. She delivers a warm touchy feeling convincing me she owned the club, she loved the club and she wasn't selling her club. Hard set and beautiful, standing tall and confident, singing "" You Haven't Seen the Last of Me;"" Cher is a true goddess, definitive of stage and production. I needed to see more and more of her . You can't get enough of Cher and her makeup, her hair and her famous, I know everything attitude.Christina is the sweetest part of the movie. She worked Burlesque from the beginning to the end with an Eminem's 8 mile state of mind, you only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow. Without a doubt, she definitely lost herself in the music, the moment, and the dancing. When you know you got it, you go get it. She wore skimpy cultured pearls, juicy bareback couture glittering with diamonds, and holding ostrich feathers only, as she paraded the stage singing slow songs, old songs and hip hop songs. Her roommate Jack, black eyeliner by night, is the movie's secret eye candy. Well built, nice teeth, and shy, he gives us a little touch of burlesque with his steamy and lusty private moves. And of course we need to mention Sean played by Stanley Tucci. He held the movie together or should I say he held Tess together.Burlesque is an eye-popping never boring cinematic experience that will entertain you with grandeur songs from the present and the past. As you experience this razzle dazzle movie, you can actually feel the music. To me, Burlesque mirrors Purple Rain's electrifying energy that generated from a club of talented, struggling performers and a sidekick love affair. Christina and Cher in Burlesque will be remembered like Prince in Purple Rain. You have to see it again and again, because true talent never ages, its ageless. I just loved every mind- blowing performance and I'm sure you will too, so GO see it!!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
How do i become burlesque?,"Not good enough to be a 7 but not really as bad as a 6, i quite liked burlesque. Its a little lacking in the story and seems to loose steam towards the latter end of the film but i think all along you guess really what is going to happen when Christina walks through them club doors. Christina and Cher both really shine in this film and there is some really good looking guys and a little romance to boot. The singing and dancing is impeccable and seems almost like a modern day 'King Creole' come 'Chicago' although both of them films do have more to their plot than this.

Go Sister..,"I've watched this movie many times on reruns (TV). Christine has an incredible talent and frankly I'd watch just the parts with her singing. But she did very well as an actress and wasn't just 'used' because of her killer voice. The movie runs a typical plot with the unknown girl with a hidden talent who goes from the rags to riches while trying to balance her personal life with career, and of course the gambit of choosing the 'right guy'. The relationships between characters was very good. I totally love Stanley Tucci in anything he does, and as usual, he was great in this.

What is this place? A stripclub?,"Story-wise this picture is once more one of the oldest in the book... A failing business, rich man wanting to buy everything to close shop and build something else, goose with golden eggs is found and all is well on Sunset Boulevard. Not a lot of surprises there. But hey, to me, the storyline hadn't become a drag or didn't feel too much of a cliché when watching, which is something you want to pay attention to when milking off an old theme.There is quite some singing involved which means a lot of lip-sync. Tough job for the director who has to make it look like characters are actually singing ""live"". Mr. Antin, Steve, I'm sorry but you did quite the shitty job there. I get it, you're not a music-video-director. But please dear, don't try to be one then. Some of the songs ""preformed"" by Aguilera are so much out of sync it becomes funny. Not irritating, but funny. A flaw which was partially mended by the quality of the songs and the acts. The movie has a soundtrack that is kind to the ears (at least mine) and acts that are very nicely filmed and choreographed. But I ask you, again, WHY is it that Richard Gere and Renée Zellweger can be made to lip songs almost perfectly (Chicago) and Aguilera (& Cher) can't? Moving on to the performance of the 2 main artists/actors... Chrisina Aquilera and Cher. I àm a fan of both (actually a big big Cher-fan) so I'm a little biased. But I think they did great. Ignoring the sync (I know, I'll try and let go), you get to hear (and see) 2 amazing voices utilized to their full extent. The Etta James-esque sound of Aguilera and the slightly masculine undertoned Cher-voice. Also acting-wise they did good.So... We have here a movie that is a lot of fun to watch (and hear), nothing' more nothing' less. Guaranteed to give you a gay old time, in every sense of the word!",7.0,Anonymous,Music

LA Cabaret,"At least it's got Cher, and the iconic ""Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend"". There isn't much else to see or listen to. Annoyingly unoriginal story about an ambitious, small town Iowa girl named Ali (Christina Aguilera), who leaves the slow lane for the fast lights and glitter of L.A.There, she too easily lands a job at a nightclub overseen by Tess (Cher). The club features small tables and a stage whereupon mini-clad young ladies dance, lip-sync to the music, and pose evocatively for mostly male patrons. Ali gets her chance to replace the lead performer. Along the way, various characters and incidents intersperse the club's stage numbers to keep the contrived plot moving along.You get the feeling that the entire script was written for Aguilera. Yes, she can sing, if by singing you mean yelling out lyrics attached to modern rap beats, nominally called ""music"", devoid of melody or substantive meaning. Aguilera specializes in loudness. The stage numbers start out fine, before Aguilera horns in, but then deteriorate. The final stage number reeks of cringe inducing, vapid noise.Further, Aguilera is miscast. She looks too little-girl innocent in the first half; in the second, with all that garish makeup and posing, she looks horribly fake. Cher is better cast and I like her backstage presence. Performances are okay. Indoor lighting looks convincing. But the stage seems to change size; in one scene, it looks small, in another, overwhelming.I would have preferred a more unpredictable plot, more emphasis on Cher's character, a different actor for the Ali character, and stage numbers that didn't sound like they came from the portfolio of Justin Bieber. Still, the presence of Cher elevates ""Burlesque"" to borderline entertaining. It's worth a one-time watch.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Burlesque : Very good for that kind of movie,"So, it's a movie about a lounge with signers and dancers. It's not a musical, but you expect to see dancing, sexy and songs. Burlesque delivers on all account, it's sexy without being naked, it's fun, the music is great.I don't know why so many reviewers here say that Christina Aguilera is a bad actress, she gave quite a decent performance considering that, well, she is not an actress. And while Cher is not on the screen all the time, she is fantastic. For a woman in her sixties, wow...The movie made me buy the soundtrack, Christina know how to sing and she is very good.As for the background stories (lounge on the verge of closing, love interest), they are there to give the movie some meaning but are not overly invading on the main content witch is signing and dancing. Those background stories are were the movie lost my 2 points, because you don't quite feel the urgency, stress of Tess money problems, everything runs like there is no problem at all.All in all, it's a good, entertaining movie. It's gonna be in my blu-ray collection, just for the music and dancing alone.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Great cast, great songs, great costumes, why do people hate this movie?","I have just watched this movie for the first time today, and I must say that I don't understand why I listened to the other reviews. All I heard was that the acting was horrible and the story was bland and so on. I will say that the opening scene is a bit too empty, but then Christina starts singing and you forget all about it. The cast is amazing: for the guys we have Christina Aguilera, Kristen Bell, Julianne Hough, Chelsea Traille and the rest of the girls, even Dianna Agron; for the ladies we have Eric Dane and of course the sculptured Cam Gigandet; of course we can't forget about the acting powerhouse that is Stanley Tucci playing the gay best friend that every woman wishes she had (especially if he is that good looking); and we can't forget about Peter Gallagher and Alan Cumming. There is a lot more eye candy from all the boys that work at Burlesque. The story is somewhat predictable but I find that the way it is told, between music and extra little drama in the background, makes it perfect. Just hearing Christina Aguilera singing is enough to carry the story along. Cher has a solo about halfway through the movie that brings you back to one of the main issues in the background which makes for a very powerful solo thanks to that story and the power of Cher's voice makes it even more dramatic. The writing is exquisite due to a main reason, it is perfectly real. It is not full of extra fluff and puff just to create some kind of big moment. It has lots of funny in it, but very subtle . Bottom line is, the script is simple, to the point and every line sounds like something you would hear somebody say in real life. Many films have all that dialogue that you know nobody would ever say but it makes for those big moment, but the simplicity in this movie is what makes me like it so much. It is a simple film, with an amazing cast, that I believe has been completely overlooked. I have a theory as to why it has been overlooked...the marketing for it wasn't very good, it only focused on Cher and Christina and it made very little reference to any of the other amazing people in it or even to the story. The trailer makes it sound like it is all about the dancing and sining, but there is an actual story behind it all. The love story is only partially shown on the trailer, there isn't even one image of Eric Dane or Peter Gallagher, there is too much information about the dancing part as well, I personally think they should have left a little mystery on the dancing and singing and added some more of the story into it.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Not bad but it ain't perfect either,"Here is the thing about BURLESQUE: it's a film with entertainment purposes that delivers just that without reaching some sort of superior level in the cinematography industry. At the end of the day, BURLESQUE is a film about a girl who has nothing in life but dancing and singing amazingly without any type of training who might or not get to succeed in life at a club she ends up loving. It's not bad: the songs are funny, Christina Aguilera's voice is amazing, Cher does her job as well, Stanley Tucci is funny and there is some romance and drama during the whole thing to make you interested. But it lacks some depth. Even though it's enjoyable and funny and cute, it's not exactly new - somewhere someone watched something already that resembles this. Also, I thought some things were happening too fast - I would prefer to have less plots. Instead, we had several characters that interacted, with several different plots that worked just fine but would work better if given the time - which was not given.Basically, it is something people can watch and enjoy and some songs might make you want to dance or sing, but it's not something to be taken way too seriously. The idea is to entertain and that is completely delivered.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"A funny, traditional feel-good movie musical dazzles","There are plenty of things that are wrong or off with Burlesque. Sometimes it's out of focus, the characters could have been more three- dimensional and its plot could have been more elaborate and original. Yet, ""Burlesque"" never fails to be entertaining and fun with occasional funny dialog, perfectly choreographed and directed dance and song numbers with a blooming love story in the mix. And there's Cher!The aim of ""Burlesque"" is to provide the audience with a sense of feeling good about themselves, with an ease that is hard to express in words. When the story calls for character moments, it's all very sweet and innocent, even if these people wouldn't want to be seen as such. In one scene, Tess (Cher) discovers one of her dancers is pregnant (which opens the door for Christina Aguilera's Ali to assume her place and let her star shine). Tess is a very tough woman, so you'd expect the poor girl to be fired. Instead, Tess promises to take very good care of her and she has nothing to be afraid of.The kind of sweetness even penetrates the burlesque numbers (no pun intended!). Even though they are very erotic and playful, there is no nudity to be found here. The women enjoy being on stage and dancing burlesque is just like any other job. When the working day is done, you'll go for pizza with your co-workers.The sweetness is all the more surprising, considering the temptation to go from respectable to pure sexual exposition. Even the one sex scene in the film is about cookies and where to get them, if you'll be in the mood for a bite.It's just that sweet.",,Anonymous,Music
Pathetic,"Though I found this movie to be stunning superficially, with beautiful costumes and great shows, I can't help but feel like the story fell flat.

Not great but don't stop making them.,"A hokey but passable story about small town youth(s) who come to tinsel town to make their mark but then get tossed around by the nightclub business. Love interest, good guys, bad guys, happy ending, it's all there. Some good acting. Don't blame the actors for the script. Sher is timeless as a stage/screen presence and she can read any line she wants. Music score, excellent. Dance routines are OK but are badly fractured by the rapid clip changes. The film editor gets a C minus or maybe they couldn't hold their dance routines for more than 1.5 seconds.I'm a song and dance kind of guy. Big screen, big sound all the way. But, we've seen it before. The ancestor to this genre, for me, was the best of them all - Caberet. With a nod to 'Chorus Line' and 'Chicago', nothing else has since come close on the screen. That doesn't mean this wasn't a good effort. But ""Good efforts"" are in the same category as ""nice guys"" who are supposed to finish last.Don't wait for the small screen on this one. but go to the bargain matinée. As you leave give a quiet thought to Bob Fosse and Rob Marshall. There may be an Academy award nomination somewhere here, but I'm probably not smart enough to see it.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
terrible story,"The plot to this movie was awful. It was so cliché and predictable and boring. This is by far the worst musical that has been made lately. The only positive thing I can say is there were a couple of good songs in it. First, Christina Aguilera is not an actor. She even looks weird without her silly bleached blonde hair. Jack her love interest can't act. Stanley Tucci was the only decent actor. I like Cher, but her role as the older successful dancer trying to ""mother"" the up and comer while saving her club was dull.I can't believe the writers of this movie ever got it made. They must have known someone who knew someone who knew someone. It's that bad of a script.FINAL VERDICT: Don't waste your time.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
"High octane, fast paced musical is super fun, even if it's not a masterpiece","I, unlike a lot of people in lieu to it's box office results, really wanted to see Burlesque. I am not necessarily a Christina Aguilera fan, though she has made a lot of songs I like, same deal for Cher, and though the movie did not seem like it would be a 10/10, it looked insanely fun for my tastes and I had been invited by my friend and her mom to go see it with them. We were all fairly excited, after seeing the previews and hearing of what reception it did get from audiences was generally well perceived, and, directly after it was over, were pleased to admit that all three of us really enjoyed it and were not disappointed.There is not really many downsides to this movie, in my honest opinion, that can not be made up for with other material. For example: The songs, while not all are memorable, make the movie ultimately more enjoyable, and have some nice choreography to the dances that were made for them. ""Show Me How to Burlesque"" is my favorite song, with Cher's ""You Haven't Seen the Last of Me"" and another song, that incongruently and infuriatingly is not listed in the soundtrack titles on here, and did not have a really huge part in the movie other than it being my favorite dance sequence, besides ""Show Me How to Burlesque"", being two other very catchy songs in the movie, as well. The others felt like they were there merely to fill time, because I personally did not find them that special.There's not really any brand new, awesome material, but it really is much better than people would expect in terms of entertainment and professionalism. Christina Aguilera has got some pipes. Whether you like her vocals or not, she can hit and hold a note, and she really is not that bad of an actress. She wasn't in this film, at least, and while we are at it, neither was Cher; both gave pretty believable and likable performances. Everyone gave a likable performance both acting and music wise, especially my man candy Cam Gigandet. You could grate cheese on that boy's body. There is a nice touch of comedy here and there from Alan Cumming, Stanley Tucci, and a very cute and well done scene between Aguilera and Gigandet that involves a nice shot of Gigandet's bottom and another mishap in that scene that will make anyone crave ""the box of cookies"" at that exact moment. (I love Cam Gigandet.)Moving on, another aspect is the movie has got excellent, sparkly costumes during some flashy, risqué sequences that could possibly make anyone have a seizure who was not thoroughly prepared. Another of my favorite things is it has got beautiful, and I mean beautiful lighting, and wonderful make-up in many scenes making the actors, actresses and settings look picturesque and crisp. Steve Antin, while not an amazing director, does a very nice job, and does an even better job with the writing, even if the script is not Oscar worthy. Like I have said, it is not going to be held in cinema history as the next Casablanca, or Godfather, few movies are nowadays, but this was an enjoyable experience for many reasons and I encourage anyone who thinks they can handle it for what it is to see it.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Showgirls for tweens,"I managed to see it through to the end but I couldn't watch this again. There's no real plot, no twists or turns, no excitement. It's basically small town waitress goes to LA and begs for a job as a stripper *cough* a burlesque dancer, because it's ""her biggest dream"" *rolls eyes*. I find these quite degrading. This actually felt like showgirls but without the action. Although showgirls is trashy and unrealistic, it's still very entertaining. I guess Burlesque was just a platform for Christina Aguilera to make a transition into movies (which rarely works out for popstars). Cher comes off as unlikeable and annoying. I think the point of the film was to watch Cher and Christina perform a song and dance routine...badly.",1.0,Anonymous,Music

"A campy, fun hot mess","""Burlesque"" is definitely the campiest film to come along in a long time. Before seeing this film, I suspected that it might be the new ""Showgirls,"" but alas—it was much better than that. It truly embraced its lack of originality—small town girl with tons of talent escapes banal existence in Iowa and heads to LA to seek fame, fortune, and love. There were, however, some very 21st-century elements added: Stanley Tucci as the benevolent gay sage (Hey, Stanley, aren't you in danger of being typecast in this kind of role? Just sayin'), a hot—I mean HOT—I mean HAWT—male love interest for Christina Aguilera, played by Cam Gigandet (and not only is he Hot—or did I already mention that?—but he's also quite charming), and Cher in all her surgically reconstructed glory. I must admit that Cher's appearance was sometimes so distracting that my mind wandered from the story (not to worry though—it was quite easy to re-orient myself to the achingly simple plot) and I began to wonder whether Cher's enormous lips would go rogue and devour her face. At any rate, for a singer, Christina Aguilera proved to be a pretty good actress, although I doubt her ""skill"" could stretch beyond this type of role. The songs were adequately entertaining, and there were some clever bits of dialogue amid the mostly clichéd script. Overall, a campy guilty pleasure.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

It could have been worse!,"Small town girl goes to the big city to make it big. Really? Haven't we seen this before? Well of course we have, but we've never been on this journey with Cher! Christina Aguilera plays the small town girl, who makes her way to L.A. to make it big. She lands in the Burlesque club run by Tess (Cher) and starts to wait tables while trying desperately to let Tess give her a go on stage. Meanwhile she shacks up as friends with barman Jack and befriends property developer who has his sights on the club.Of course Tess does give her a job and everyone is astounded at her talent and the club thrives. Along the way Ali, treads on toes, gets heartbroken and becomes something of a star, while then discover the true meaning of Marcus's interests and therefore saving the club and helping Tess (mother figure!!) and the romance with Jack can blossom. Hurrah! The films story is pretty standard; small town girl, the young handsome barman who also writes songs (lets hope Ali get to sing one!) the divaesque star of the club who's limelight is stolen and the charming, but obviously has something else planned man. But despite all this the film rolls along very merrily and is really quite entertaining. Set mostly in the club, the director may have watched films like Moulin Rouge, Cabaret, Dreamgirls or Chicago before walking on set, but there is a great visual style to it with well staged musical numbers which are quite catchy, with only the slow ballads being a bit cheesy. Perhaps the burlesque element is a little bit of a modern interpretation, with only a feather fan number alluded to traditional burlesque, but that aside the musical numbers make the flow of the film move well.Aguilera is quite good as Ali, though it's not a big step away from her normal performing persona. Cher of course is Cher and doesn't really have to do anything, she's just great; there are two handsome lead male characters and while it seems Stanley Tucci came from the set of The Devil Wears Prada still in character, he is fun on screen and there is a nice relationship between him and Cher.The film never really goes anywhere and the plot is painfully obvious, but it also never becomes too serious and the issues are light in their nature with only a brief foray into the a story about drinking. In fact the film is quite good fun, with some nice moments throughout, such as when Ali arrives at Sean's apartment only to find a male guest with neither of them remembering each others name.Not as bad as Showgirls, but without as much style or drama of Moulin Rouge or Cabaret, this is still an enjoyable romp that's a lot of fun.More of my review at my site iheartfilms.weebly.com",7.0,Anonymous,Music
meh,"Burlesque is visually stunning (costumes, makeup, sets, views of LA are all wows), has great music, showcases talented dancers, and has a promising cast. I really wanted to love this movie. Really did! But a flat storyline can't save this movie. Small-town girl Ali moves to the big city, overnight has a waitressing job in her dream location, and a potential love interest. She impresses the stressed boss, Cher. Cue the predictable challenge to overcome (she gets robbed and loses all her money), romantic stress (he has a fiancée), sudden break for fame (bitchy sabotage goes wrong when Ali proves she can really sing), quandary over who to trust (moneyed potential investor who may or may not have evil motives), and simple solution to resolve all the challenges her employer faces (spoiler: air rights). Xtina's vocal chops are undeniable but her dancing skills leave something to be desired. Thank goodness for rapid-fire editing to work around her. Cher is fine in her seen-it-all henhouse-mother strapped with financial problems and uninspired lines to say. She sings a couple songs but the audience doesn't get to see her in her performing glory so she's somewhat wasted in this role. Stanley Tucci is as charming and supportive as they come as Cher's right-hand man. Cam Giganget is hot!! as the roommate/love interest, Kristen Bell has moves and attitude to spare as the star being replaced by Ali, Eric Danes is sexy and dangerous as the investor/potential alternate love interest, while the incredible Alan Cumming is woefully underused in his 27 seconds of screen time. The soundtrack will be good overall, but the final song--written by Christina and specially picked to get audiences singing and dancing their way out of the theatre--is largely forgettable. Kind of like the movie overall.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"""Coyote Ugly"" meets ""Chicago"" with Christina Aguilera & Cher","Released in 2010, ""Burlesque"" is a drama/musical about a bored small town girl (Christina Aguilera) who moves to the big city to better her life and, hopefully, do something with her great talents. She gets a waitress job at a nightclub and eventually talks the owner (Cher) into allowing her to perform. Cam Gigandet plays the potential beau while Peter Gallagher appears as the club owner's ex-husband and part owner. Stanley Tucci plays the likable stage manager while Kristen Bell & Julianne Hough are on hand as dancers. Eric Dane plays the arrogant mogul who wants to purchase the club and build condos.My title blurb says it all: ""Burlesque"" combines the plot of 2000's ""Coyote Ugly"" with elements of 2002's ""Chicago,"" particularly the curvy women and burlesque dancing sequences. While it failed to achieve the moderate success of ""Coyote Ugly"" at the box office, it's a significantly better movie. Although both films have the familiar formula plot, ""Burlesque"" has a more compelling story with a more dynamic cast and superior song & dance. It also has better women, as far as curvy appeal goes (with the arguable exception of Piper Perabo, the women in ""Coyote Ugly"" had the non-curvy shape of 12 year-old boys). Someone criticized that Aguilera was too ""old"" for the role. Poppycock. She was 29 during filming and easily passed for someone in her late teens/early twenties. Despite her alluring powers, she had the youthful/winsome/innocent vibe to pull off the part.There's a surprising peripheral plot about how homosexual relationships start with 'sex' and proceed from there.The film runs 119 minutes and was shot entirely at Sony Pictures Studios, Culver City, California. It was written & directed by Steve Antin.GRADE: B-",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A Maudlin Film That Brings Out the Worst in Everyone,"First off, I LOVE movie musicals. They may be my favorite kind of movie, so naturally, I was dying to see Burlesque from the moment I saw the first ad back in September. When I finally saw it, it was beyond disappointing. I figured, ""Well, if the movie sucks, at least there'll be some fun, Moulin Rouge costumes."" Wrong again! The costumes were largely uncreative- too much like a Victoria's Secret catalogue.But on to the worst part- the acting. This film drags everyone down.Christina Aguilera is horrid in the main role. I've always been a fan of hers and was excited to see her act. She can't. At all. Her character's overly dramatic back-story would be hard to play well even for a talented veteran, but Aguilera makes it seem like a bad made for TV movie. She's a fabulous singer, but she ain't no actress. Despite being ""a real actress,"" Kristen Bell failed utterly as bad girl Nikki. She's gorgeous and plays ""the bitch"" well, but when she was supposed to be drunk, the only tip-off was that Cher wouldn't let her drive. Cher is one of the few in this film who did a quality performance, when the terrible writing didn't drag her down. Cam Gigandet was also commendable, but again, the lines his character was given were cringe-worthy. Example: while on the phone with his fiancé, Gigandet looks at Auilera's character across the room and says ""My future? I'm looking at it."" I vomited Sour Patch Kids into my drink. Even Stanley Tucci flubbed this film, although his performance in the second half is better.On a positive note, Alan Cumming's character was a cute nod to Cabaret.",3.0,Anonymous,Music

A sexually bashful bump-and-grind...,"Bar-waitress from Iowa ditches the sticks with a bus ticket to Hollywood, where she seeks employment as a singer; she finds an extravagant strip club on the Strip--where nobody strips!--and eventually worms her way into a dancing audition. Steve Antin wrote and directed this modern-day razzle-dazzle musical fantasy, apparently after overdosing on a double feature of ""Cabaret"" and ""A Star Is Born"". The film apes Fosse's ""Cabaret"" openly and unashamedly (not that fans of star Christina Aguilera would notice), even throwing in a dance routine to the ""Cabaret"" instrumental ""Sitting Pretty"". In fact, Antin is so wrapped up in his movie homages (i.e., stealing bits and pieces from various films, including ""Midnight Cowboy"" for the first few minutes) that he forgets to make sense out of the one he's directing. Cher runs the Burlesque club, and performs whenever she feels like it, but is in debt to the bank and may have close the joint down (a subplot right out of a 1940s Betty Hutton picture); in the mean time, Aguilera, who's been hiding her singing light under a bushel, finally belts out a smoky number and brings down the house--but will it be enough to get the hot-spot out of hock? Perhaps using less electricity in the stage numbers would curb their Edison bill? There's a musclebound bartender who has eyes for Christina (he wears eyeliner and she initially thinks he's gay, the only time that word is mentioned), while Stanley Tucci flits about like Peter Pan playing Cher's assistant (his character is gay, but Antin is as bashful of that as is he about the girls' stage routines). There's no connection between ""Burlesque"" and reality; it's all smoke-and-mirrors piffle. Cher doesn't want to sell the club, nobody can offer her enough money to give up the club, yet she won't listen to anyone's suggestions and she doesn't want to change the format. The welfare of her dancers barely comes into the equation--they don't even seem aware of the club's money troubles. The generic boy-girl romance between bartender/songwriter and singer/dancer is used as a fringe element, and has so little relevance to the central action that it becomes a chore to get through (it has been added simply to extend Aguilera's profile). Throughout, we get bitchy backstage banter and Vegas-styled musical numbers without anything concrete to support the issues of loyalty the script timidly raises. ""Burlesque"" has a chronic case of ""Peter Pan""-itis...it refuses to allow grown-up actors the chance to act grown-up on the screen. ** from ****",5.0,Anonymous,Music

The music caters for most tastes and some of the adaptations of oldies are catchy and toe-tappingly good. Even the acting was good. Perhaps it was because, as seasoned stage muso's, it did not require acting, but just doing what they do frequently.

Burlesque: The Music Video (Extended Version),"TL;DR: Good musical entertainment, not a good MOVIE as a whole. Come for music and dance, not for acting and plot. To be enjoyed in musical zombie mode. Straight to the point, Burlesque's musical numbers are exciting and attractive but has almost no plot (at least not as far as it tries to make me care). I watched this with my mother who knows little English so she only enjoyed the musical numbers and the pretty faces. Later, I felt like that was all I enjoyed too. Good thing for the film, the music is frequent and enjoyable.On the other hand, the layers to the story are simple: a financially- troubled club, a small-town hopeful and a love interest. Despite working on very familiar premises for a plot, the film makes no effort whatsoever to make any magic happen. The story doesn't take the back seat, it's in the trunk. I didn't care what happened to any of the characters as long as they lived to perform another song.

And those waits were long because they were filled with Christina Aguilera's bad acting and the movie's overall bad direction, filming and plot. Cher, when she got a few minutes in front of the camera, was mesmerizing, Aguilera, who got way too much time in front of the camera... was not so mesmerizing - she should stick to just singing.The filming was erratic and changed styles several times within short periods.

A Nutshell Review: Burlesque,"With singers making their leap onto the silver screen from Mariah Carey to Britney Spears even though with varying degrees of success, it's taken quite the while for the pint sized girl with that tremendous big voice to cautiously and finally dabble with film, making her big screen debut playing a performer no less, guided by and given her break by the legendary diva Cher. Welcome to Burlesque, which is probably the cheapest ticket you can find in order to sit in a Christina Aguilera performance.Written and directed by first timer Steve Antin, don't expect a story that will knock your socks off, as playing it safe is the catchphrase here, telling a tale that's been told a thousand times involving a small town girl aspiring to make it good in the bright lights of a big city, overcoming adversary and encountering romance as part of the package called Life. Burlesque doesn't attempt to deviate from formula about a from rags to riches story, where perseverance is the order of the day if one's talents should be discovered, and a chance given to prove oneself.The opening scene establishes Ali(ce) (Aguilera) leaving her waitressing job in Iowa for Los Angeles, and finding herself inexplicably burgled, and waiting for that chance of a lifetime to perform in a cabaret called Burlesque, run by Cher's Tess, the only veteran performer who uses her real singing voice, amongst her posse of beautiful women who gyrate to and lip sync to classics. Think of it as one Bollywood song and dance routine on stage, with lights, colours, larger than life personalities such as the diva with bad attitude Nikki (Kristen Bell). Enter Ali into Tess's life by gatecrashing and working for free on the only job she knows how, picking up moves on the sly and barging her way into an audition which, well, turned out good. And as they say the rest is history.She's Christina Aguilera after all, so how can one not be surprised by the quality of the vocals and performing routine? What Burlesque made up for its lack of a quality story and clumsy romantic subplot involving the bartender Jack (Cam Gigandet) and a rich real estate mogul Marcus (Eric Dane) setting his sights on acquiring the land Burlesque sits on, is that of Aguilera's performance with her powerful voice coming on when Ali has no choice when sabotaged on her lip sync routine, to let the real deal out of the bag. However even then the slower numbers turned out to be quite a drag, with the film actually coming alive with the more upbeat, electrifying numbers with Aguilera and the ensemble of supporting dancers and stage performers.And those numbers, from Express to Show Me How You Burlesque, are bang for the buck and that's what musicals are made of, with performances, song and music that stand out from the competition, entertaining as hell, without trying to hard to stick a sultry image on Aguilera with the slower numbers in cheesy, cheeky cabaret routines. These set pieces are what made Burlesque worth that close to two hours to sit through, and one had hoped for an encore performance of sorts when the end credit rolled, which did not materialize.The rest of the film is largely forgettable, with Cher playing a character who's bogged down by money woes to save her club, though her musical numbers You Haven't Seen the Last of Me, and Welcome to Burlesque will leave you wondering why she isn't given more to do, having to disappear in the middle section of the film to may way for the emergence of Aguilera's Ali as the very polished gem to have landed on her lap. Cher can't play mean and sarcastic, and the surrogate mom turn and potential wasn't capitalized other than a few sporadic scenes, which I suppose is expected from Steve Antin's rookie attempt.Musical numbers don't move the narrative forward, having to stand out as standalone pieces of singular performances, which of course makes this almost akin to a Christina Aguilera concert. The supporting cast of Alan Cumming got wasted in scenes that don't last five minutes combined, Kristen Bell playing a prima dona that doesn't have much to do except hiss at Aguilera's character, and Stanley Tucci once again plays the saviour and shield type of character protecting young upstarts from the wrath of the resident boss, reprising a role already seen in The Devil Wears Prada, and probably an avenue and outlet for that character to explore should he be served the pink slip at the fashion magazine house.Christina Aguilera fans won't miss this for the world, but for the rest of the movie going audience, it's more of a musical deja vu of stories set in a cabaret that could have benefited from a gutsier storyline and better fleshed out characters, but be prepared to be enthralled at how Aguilera can conjure up such powerful vocals for her size and allows for her character to breathe some hope into Burlesque.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A Well Preserved Cher Keeps This Predictable Pile of Showbiz Clichés Afloat,"Despite an eye-catching veneer that appears like a stylistic cross between Bob Fosse (""Cabaret"") and Rob Marshall (""Chicago""), this 2010 backstage musical written and directed by former actor Steve Antin is pure Hollywood hokum repackaged for the ""American Idol"" generation. Rather than being remotely provocative in subject or treatment, the film is actually a slapdash, new-millennium update of ""42nd Street"" in which the classic 1933 movie's most famous line, ""You're going out a youngster, but you've got to come back a star!"", applies perfectly here. The youngster in this case is pop star Christina Aguilera in her feature film debut as Ali Rose, a plucky Iowa waitress described scabrously by an alcohol-fueled rival named Nikki as a ""slut with mutant lungs"". Your reaction to that comment will depend on how much you like Aguilera's throaty, blues-inspired holler of a singing voice. You would have to enjoy it a lot to sit through the several production numbers she performs in the movie.The story is trite. Ali leaves Iowa for LA on a bus and faces exactly one day of unemployment during our current economic malaise when she discovers the Burlesque Lounge on the Sunset Strip. Talking her way into a waitress job thanks to sympathetic bartender Jack, she desperately tries to persuade the club's owner Tess that she belongs on the stage with all the leggy, lip-synching dancers. A dancer's unplanned pregnancy gives Ali the chance to audition and take her place, and then conveniently, Tess picks Ali to substitute for a drunken Nikki to take the lead one night. Out of spite, Nikki cuts off the recorded music at which point Ali sings in her own voice. In perhaps the most patronizing scene, the awestruck reactions of customers and colleagues insure her immediate stardom and Nikki's vengeful wrath. As Ali's star ascends, she is also caught in a romantic triangle between Jack and a wealthy opportunist named Marcus.Meanwhile, Tess faces the prospect of losing her club despite the good fortune brought forth by Ali's emerging fame. If you can't figure out the rest of the by-the-numbers plot, clearly you don't get out much. Even though the film is a showcase for Aguilera, it is really Cher who anchors it with her dry insouciance and sheer professionalism. At 64, she looks great in a highly cosmeticized way, but it's really her natural likability and her two standout numbers that linger in the memory. The first is a teasing nod to ""Cabaret"" called ""Welcome to Burlesque"" and the second is a Diane Warren-penned power ballad, ""You Haven't Seen the Last of Me"", which she sings with the same emotional fervor Jennifer Hudson did with her big ""Dreamgirls"" number, ""And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going"". Aguilera acquits herself well as Ali. It's just that the role is such a predictable set of clichés when she's offstage.As Tess' loyal confidante, Stanley Tucci plays almost exactly the same role he played in ""The Devil Wears Prada"" and in the same wry manner that works just as well here. Cam Gigandet as Jack and Eric Dane as Marcus aren't given much opportunity to make memorable impressions. Kristen Bell has a few choice moments showing her talons as Nikki. Shallow entertainment for those in the mood for it. Extras are plentiful but not indispensable on the 2011 DVD/Blu-Ray. There is a talky but none too insightful commentary track from Antin, an alternate opening sequence that extends the Iowa setting, a five-minute blooper reel, and footage of six uncut musical numbers. The Blue-Ray additionally offers a five-part making-of featurette for true fans of the film.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Excellent but not Burlesque and that is fine,"Movie BurlesqueFirst of all, regardless of what I say during this, I do recommend the movie. I am a sucker for a group of pretty women dancing. Partially because I am a male, but women to me often have great moves and are not afraid to go with the music as many males are. Also this movie was done in what I would call good taste and there was honestly little that even I an older person would find offensive. And Cher And Christine Aguilera also played their parts well, and were often fun at times.That being said, I would say that this movie called Burlesque had little to do with Burlesque, and I for one am fine with that, but it needs to be said. The women wore cute costumes, seldom showed much, and mostly had brash powerful music. Were they trying to threaten the audience? So I sort of saw this as ""Burlesque as preferred by a women"" ha, ha, sort of along the lines of, ""I am woman, hear me roar"". But I do not think the Moulin Rouge in Paris will be picking up this act soon. If meant as an allure alone, most men I think prefer at least a small amount of feminine side and sweetness on stage of the women. But again, what is wrong here is that I would not call this Burlesque, but something quite good more along the lines of the Rockettes. And as for the music, Cher sang two nice songs I believe and was her usual great self. I did not recognize Christine Aguilera at first and had to look up her name, but her voice was beyond talented. She had exceptional range and was able to do voice tricks such as being gravely at this point or smooth at another. But again for my tastes, even though I call that extreme talent, I tend to like songs more melodic, perhaps dare I say romantic. Christine's songs were too powerful for my tastes and came across more as if she were doing ""76 trombones"" rather than trying for sexy. But talented? Quite talented. I was left wondering who else on this planet could have sung the parts of Christine Aguilera.And so I would highly recommend it as decent acting, good taste, great female dancing, even though the title ""Burlesque"" would seem not quite right. But yes I want to watch it again. Perhaps I am even happy that it was not the normal Burlesque.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"In the end, we have a lot of light, spotlight and good songs, piled on top of each other without much meaning or connection. But it is great to see Aguilera and Cher anyway!","Among all the cinematographic genres, I think that the musical is the one that causes the most work for directors, actors and technical staff. The mix between music, dialogues, choreography, acting, dramatic world and fantastic world is not something easy to accomplish, because in addition to demanding a lot of originality - so that the product does not appear as a crude singing drama - the genre demands a great deal from the director. Mastery of the stage and capture of images, something that is far from Steve Antin, actor, screenwriter and film producer who signed ""Burlesque"", an extravagant musical, with a script that is a compilation of teenage stories, romantic comedies by Nancy Meyers and quotes as far as the eye can see taken from All That Jazz, Cabaret and Chicago.Ali (Christina Aguilera) left her small hometown in search of success in Los Angeles. As soon as she arrives, she discovers the Burlesque nightclub, which specializes in musical shows by beautiful women, who always perform using playback. The place is managed by Tess (Cher), who denies Ali a chance. She insists and manages to be hired as a waitress, thanks to the help of the clerk Jack (Cam Gigandet). Ali starts to accompany all the shows, memorizing the songs and choreographies. When Tess and her right-hand man Sean (Stanley Tucci) hold an audition for new dancers, Ali jumps at the chance to show what she's made of.The distinguished musical films ""Moulin Rouge"" (2001), ""Chicago"" (2002) and ""Nine"" (2009) are rare examples of recent North American musicals that really convinced the critics with their narrative and musical quality. The truth is that most musicals in recent years have fallen far short of audience expectations and this ""Burlesque"" is no exception to the rule, because despite offering us some interesting musical sequences, it ends up presenting us with a mediocre narrative that is interpreted by a luxury cast that unfortunately also fell short of expectations. The best thing about Burlesque is the supporting line emblazoned on the poster: ""it takes a legend to make a star"". And that's the idea of the project: to unite one of the biggest divas of the pop universe - Cher - to a singer in formation - Christina Aguilera. The first is a legend, yes, and the second is a star, undeniably. And the union of the two, if it doesn't set the canvas on fire, at least it doesn't cause any embarrassment. Some have said that this isn't even a movie, it's so absurd that it's all we see. And whoever makes this claim is not entirely wrong. He just didn't see the full picture. What matters here is much more the elements beyond the story - artists, music, glamour, fantasy - and it is from this side that one must evaluate.Director and screenwriter Steven Antin's decision to focus the film on musical numbers is smart - there are ten in all - since the story is beat, the performances are poor and the jokes don't work. Aguilera tries, but is not very convincing. Eric Dane manages to be more canasta than his Dr. McSteamy from Grey's Anatomy. Cam Gigandet's main merit is his respectable abs and Stanley Tucci practically repeats his role from The Devil Wears Prada, but still adding a lot of fun to Burlesque. There is also Alan Cumming, who is normally a good comedic actor, and here he appears badly used. Cher, on the other hand, makes use of all her presence and pose to play Tess - it is no coincidence that she is nicknamed the Goddess of Pop. However, even with a Best Actress Oscar on the shelf (for Moonstruck, 1987), it's hard to let go of the fact that she is ""the Cher"" and accept her as someone else. Cher has inspired moments, but misses out on the more dramatic scenes, which require more acting resources (or better directing actors, which is the more likely case, considering she and Tucci deliver the best performances of the cast).Antin still fails to take advantage of the squad he had at hand. Cher was extremely underused, with only two solos, the worst being the first. The second, although well sung and with some connection to the dramatic moment of the script, sounds too tragic... The atmosphere of the film did not ask for so much. The same thing happens with Aguilera's beautiful but displaced performance of the song Bound to You. From the lyrics of the song to the actress's costume, everything is a discrepancy with the atmosphere built up to that moment. The sequence looks like a gratuitous and inexplicable sketch, breaks the final rhythm of the staggering work, is enchanting only for the voice of the actress and her remarkable presentation, but is inappropriate within the story.The director does little to remove from the viewer the uncomfortable feeling of cinematic déjà-vu - in the worst sense of that word. And to make matters worse, Antin took the marketing around Christina Aguilera too seriously and forgot the basic principle of the musical genre: songs should help tell the story, not just presented as if it were a soundtrack performed live. At most, the director manages to make the acoustic character of film music disappear and this drags on for two hours of projection in songs that, for the most part, add little to the film. The various musical sequences of ""Burlesque"" are visually appealing and instill a certain liveliness in this musical. Christina Aguilera and Cher interpret some relatively well-known songs like ""Something's Got a Hold on Me"" and ""Tough Lover"", or new songs like ""You Haven't Seen the Last of Me"" and ""Show Me How You Burlesque"", therefore, these musical sequences end up being the best element of this film.Except for the banana choreography (the funniest one) and the graceful ""feathered homage"" to the burlesque dancer and actress Sally Rand (1904 - 1979), there isn't much to worry about with the supposed ""debauchery"" of the place. Some of the songs are familiar and there is at least one great moment: Cher singing the beautiful ballad You Haven't Seen the Last of Me by Diane Warren. The musical numbers, in fact, serve as an illustration of the bar, they are more of an appendix than an integral part of the script, whose focus is divided on Ali's pursuit of stardom and Tess's maintenance of the venue. It is also practically impossible not to compare them (in plasticity) with the musical numbers of Moulin Rouge (2001), by Baz Luhrmann, and Chicago (2002), by Rob Marshall. And, before I forget, it is far superior to Nine (2009), also by Marshall.Not knowing how to deal scenically with the great and beautiful dancers of the cast, nor to explore other things of the protagonists than the basics (with momentary vocal exceptions in relation to Christina Aguilera), Antin made his musical an abysmal mixture, with dialogues coming from the same way as ""The Devil Wears Prada"" and sexual situations coated with a funky pseudo-cult approach. In the director's hands, everything seems too burlesque to even disguise itself as ""artistic intent"". Entire sequences are ""saved"" only on assembly, and this, we know, is not enough for the entire product. The film's soundtrack is simply amazing, Christina Aguilera's musical performance is very good, but there isn't a moment when all these little parts come together. If one thing works, another goes wrong.""Burlesque"" is a movie to watch and be entertained for a couple of hours and then possibly forget about. The narrative lacks grace, dramatic force, torrid romance and humor. The good direction of the music videos clashes with the rest of the ""plot"". The performance of the cast (which includes: Stanley Tucci, Eric Dane, Peter Gallagher, Kristen Bell and Cam Gigandet) is not very exciting, due to the bland script and poorly resolved characters. If the production (with highlights for photography and art direction) didn't bet so much on the cliché of old musicals, on the ease (happiness?) of the ""romantic"" commonplace, this would be a more exciting musical. The production has quality, but this is independent of the director of the film. The direction thought that mixing styles, making references to classic musicals, having beautiful female bodies and a male nude on a big screen were enough to generate a great cinematographic musical, but these ingredients only manage to extend a dark veil over the feature that, in the end, after all, it turns out to be perfect mass entertainment within the industrial framework that generated it.Perhaps the biggest problem with ""Burlesque"" is the ineptness of director Steve Antin, a rookie who seems to have taken on more responsibility than he is capable of. In the end, we have a lot of light, spotlight and good songs, piled on top of each other without much meaning or connection. But who cares about that? After all, we have Aguilera screaming and Cher with all the pose that fans so applaud. It was not a smash at the box office, and the Golden Globe nomination for Best Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical (it won Best Song for Diane Warren's ""You Haven't Seen The Last Of Me"" at the awards) can be understood more as affection (and lack of options) than true recognition. But what matters is the pleasure of seeing the two divas doing exactly what we expect of them. And at that they are great.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Deaf people like songs too.,"How does a wonderful, 55 million dollar musical, made in the 21st century manage to only subtitle one and one-half songs for the deaf and foreign language audience?

I was so looking forward to this movie, but song after song was nothing but silence for me. I went right out and bought the Blu-ray version, hoping for subtitled songs, but again only one and one-half. The songs in this movie look like they are really good too.

Just watch it before bed...,"Burlesque is for Christina what Glitter (2001) wasn't for poor Mariah.The movie is just OK... there's not much to say about it as it's a piece of Moulin Rouge, Chicago and Nine, the trilogy of new modern musicals that popped theaters and now are becoming a tired formula. It's a linear easy going movie to catch all ages and people, mainly those ones who are Christina fans because the whole movie is all about her.As an actress, she's just playing her part well, thinking that this is her first big role and also her debut. As a singer there's not much to prove either because all that she sings there she already did with her 2007's Back To Basics album and this music style is almost stereotyping her career when the movie was much more successful than her new album - which got a totally different direction and was a complete commercial failure.The movie is not entirely a musical... it has a lame background story and other parallel ones that doesn't add anything interesting. Cher is okay and her acting level is equivalent to the facial expressions she's able to do, that's why she isn't making so much movies lately... Stanley Tucci is okay, being the example of people that sometimes do amazing movies and sometimes don't... Alan Cumming in a super-supporting role isn't okay. That's almost an offense as much as watching Michael Caine appearing for just 2 minutes in 'Inception' (2010).It's what a regular musical is supposed to be, even when sometimes I just used the FF button because all Christina's burlesque vocal performances were making me dizzy.Just watch it before bed.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Diamonds sparkling in a muddy bog,"Imagine, if you will, Judy Garland getting the chance to come back to life (a.k.a. ""Our Town"") to live one day - one day in which to experience the thrill of being at her best - reprising, at age 21 - in a movie showcasing her talents. It's a busy day in heaven, so God arbitrarily assigns her to play Andy Sachs, the popular heroine of The Devil Wears Prada, forgetting that Garland's voice is, after all, her greatest asset. She complains; He says, ""fine - let's try something else - bring along the same characters, the ingénue, the difficult boss with a uber-loyal sidekick manager and an impossibly bitchy colleague: but to add the music you say you want, let's set the story in ..in."" and now He's stumped, because 2010 is a far cry from Garland's prime, the 30s and 40s. ""A cabaret?"" she suggests, helpfully. ""Well, along those lines, but this is America, so, not exactly.""""Right,"" she nods, ""so, say, L.A., and 2010, so the sexuality has to be kicked up a notch..so can I tart it up a little? And throw in a few gay references?"" ""Well..."" He responds reluctantly. ""A promise is a promise. Just keep your clothes on but anything else goes. Got it,"" he agrees, scribbling the script on a cloud and kicking the story into action.Welcome to ""Burlesque."" Derivative? Totally. A strong talent base? Absolutely. Christina Aquilera channels Garland, or least matches her considerable talents, both vocal and dramatic,as the ingénue. Cher is the seemingly ageless, club-owning boss, who confidently owns the stage in a big opening number with the same title as the film. Rounding out a stellar cast are Stanley Tucci, the AC-DC right-hand friend and manager; Kristen Bell as the impossibly wicked fellow dancer; Cam Gigandet as the low-key love interest for the heroine; and Eric Danes, the too-good-to-be-true wealthy would-be lover pushing for a chance with the New Little Dancer with the Big Hidden Talent.The problem is that the talent deserves a fitting forum, but the plot is so full of holes that it ranges from being merely tedious to being ludicrous. In a strip-joint setting where willingness to show skin and lynchsync is the only required skill for dancers, and in an industry where the women are a dime a dozen, Our Plucky Gal Ali can't seem to beg her way out of waitressing and onto the stage. Later she gets the chance only when Rival Nikkie(Bell)is sent away, drunk; Nikkie then sabotages Ali's big musical number by cutting off the sound, out of sheer jealousy. Despite all this, the venom-spouting Nikkie gets to keep her job with not a single eyebrow raised. And then there's club owner Tessa (Cher), who has supposedly has been savvy enough to run the club for decade, yet seems clueless as to why she is in debt or what to do about it. Jack (Gigandet) finally beds Nikki after her extended resistance, without mentioning he hasn't really broken off with his fiancé after all. Said fiancé storms into the apartment and Nikkie is disgraced and thrown out in the middle of the night with Jack's consent - but after an attempt at apology from Jack a few days later, no prob, all is well and happily after after. There's more, but you get the picture. So--film potential, a thousand percent; realization, not so much.If you're all about the music and dancing, go for it - this is a movie you'll love. Aquilera fans - yes, this movie shows her in top form. Cher lovers - yes, she's still got what it takes - although she seems to have had so much ""work"" that one struggles to remember her original lips and eyes. The other actors work hard to pull it all together. But for those wanting the whole nine yards - the kind of movie musical that made Judy Garland the darling of her day and revered throughout America - this ain't it. This is a muddy bog of a story, sprinkled only at odd intervals with all too brief glimpses of talent. Garland, in looking at the big picture, might even have taken a pass - and gone back to heaven to savor memories of ""A Star is Born."" It's a shame that, in trying to be that movie - and ""Prada,"" and ""Cabaret,"" and ""Fosse"" that ""Burlesque"" has yet to find an identity of its own.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Was it good?  No.  Did I enjoy it? Yes:),"Obvious story of beautiful talented singer Ali (Christina Aguilera) moving from Iowa to Los Angeles to find fame and fortune. She (almost immediately) finds a job as a bartender in a bar called Berlesque Lounge run by Tess (Cher). She quickly becomes a top singer in the bar and is romanced by hot hunky roommate Jack (Cam Gigandet) and rich Marcus (Eric Dane). Totally obvious complications follow. It leads to an ending with EVERYBODY happy--and had me smirking at the screen:)OK--this is a terrible movie--there's no two ways about it. The plot is ridiculously obvious and topped by truly horrendous dialogue. There's also incredible leaps of logic--Jack is as bartender but then we see him playing piano in the band. He can do both at once??? Also Ali's rise to fame is ridiculously fast. The acting is terrible. Gigandet is a good actor--but you'd never know it from this. However the guy has NOTHING to work with. His brief nude scene is nice though:) Aguilera can sing and dance--but can't act. Some of her attempts at acting were embarrassing. Cher seems unable to move a muscle in her face. I love her but she's had TOO many face lifts! Alan Cumming,Peter Gallagher and hunky Eric Dane were shamefully underused in small roles.On the up side--the singing and dancing (and there was a LOT of both) were great! The songs were good and the dancers (male and female) were good-looking and full of energy. The last number is a true show stopper. Stanley Tucci is GREAT as the gay club manager. He easily throws off one liners in a hilarious manner. And also Gigandet is ridiculously attractive (and blows equally hot Dane off the screen). And, best of all, the dance numbers weren't edited by somebody who is ADD addicted. The camera actually stands still a few times and you can SEE the dances.So--is it good? No...but I had a fun time watching it. The singing and dancing WAS incredible. I give it a 7 for that alone...and Gigandet:)",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Diva death-match,"Take a little ""Fame"", a bit more ""Chicago"", a little bit more ""Dreamgirls"" and a lot more ""Cabaret"", mix them all up, serve cold and hey presto - ""Burlesque"" a really very clichéd, stereotypical movie musical featuring divas from the past and present in the personae of Cher and Christina Aguilera.You name it, almost every stock character and situation you can think of in this context is worked in and to death, the young, talented wannabe singer, her backstage, bitchy rival, the older Teflon-tough mother-hen club-owner with a heart of gold, her gay, sympathetic, through-thick-and-thin assistant manager, the grasping, super-rich property magnate out to buy out the failing club and the handsome, sympathetic barman who wouldn't you know it, is a gifted songwriter with a long-time, long-distance fiancé who puts up the young singer with predictable results.The story really itself from all of the above in a wholly predictable manner which would be all very well if it was well acted, staged and acted but unfortunately it isn't. Cher's face us so botoxed that she can only just make her lips move to speak, Aguilera tries hard, way too hard, to impress leaving just Stanley Tucci to steal most of his scenes as everyone's shoulder-to-cry-on.Like the aforementioned ""Dreamgirls"", the songs just aren't strong enough either and fail to lodge themselves in the memory in any way. When Aguilera's boy-friend near the end finally presents her with the big song he's been holding back for her, it's just a formulaic sub-disco effort. Moreover, it's ridiculous for Aguilera to make her big pitch to Cher by pleading to actually sing rather than lip-synch on the club stage, only for her to proceed to lip-synch all her own songs from then on.The production numbers too lack the snap and imagination of ""Chicago"", never mind anything Bob Fosse ever created, leaving the film a rather empty construct, filled with paper-thin characters and a happy ending constructed, literally out of thin air.This I'm afraid is one cabaret you don't want to come to.",3.0,Anonymous,Music

It's Not Shakespeare, but a delight none the less. I don't think this was written to be a real deep movie, just fun and entertaining, which it definitely accomplished. The musical numbers often played out like a live show, which left most movie goers clapping and screaming in the theater (which tickled me to no end because, they can't hear you silly people). I thoroughly enjoyed Burlesque and felt I definitely got my money's worth. I will go see it again before it leaves theaters, because that is where the most enjoyment can be gleaned in my opinion. Also as a warning: Be prepared to leave the movie and go shell out 12 bucks for the soundtrack, because it's almost inevitably your next stop. Kisses Darlings.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Couldn't be more generic if they tried,"In a name that cliché style a small-town orphaned Iowa girl Ali (Christina Aguilera) decides to skip her aimless diner existence and hop onto the fast lane of opportunities awaiting in Los Angeles (where else?). Once there she searches for job opportunities matching her dreams and abilities. After becoming obsessively inspired with becoming a girl at the Burlesque Lounge, led by the eternally optimistic and passionate Tess (Cher), a joint way past its glory days and awaiting imminent bank foreclosure, Ali forces herself into a job position as a waitress. Ali with her directness and never-say-die attitude quickly steps up the roster from waitress to dancer to star of the whole show. Meanwhile, until a betterment of fortunes comes around, she bunks together with bartender Jack (Cam Gigandet), an aspiring song-writer engaged to a Broadway actress.Amongst other familiar caricatures we have the trusted gay sidekick Sean (Stanley Tucci), the spiteful competitor Nikki (Kristen Bell), the business-minded realtor Marcus (Eric Dane), intent on buying out the club and replacing it with high-rise, and the club partner, ex-husband, Vince (Peter Gallagher) hoping to sell the joint at a profit. Together they form an amalgamate of well-worn characters set into the most generic story possible, rife with every lack of surprise bound to happen around the next corner.Thankfully the lead of Christina Aguilera, who delivers a surprisingly astute performance (albeit not one suggesting a glorious film career), carries the weight of triviality with her charm, pizazz and sexual appeal. Together with a host of scarcely clad beauties on high-heels, in cabarets and a lot of wiggle, the dance sequences are irrefutably engaging and well-done, even if they tend to be a bit repetitive by the fifth on-stage dance. Nonetheless wouldn't mind spending a night out on town in such a sparkling, luscious, if a tad outdated, establishment. On the downside Cher proves again why incessant plastic surgery is the death of a film career, as her face mimicry suffers from abuse and instead of focusing on the actress-singer, I subconsciously found myself attempting to pinpoint and name all operations Cher may have had in a vain attempt to prolong her youthful looks.The movie also features a small, but absolutely brilliant role as a ticketeer by Alan Cumming, who manages to steal all the thunder away from the much weightier accompanying cast. All in all enjoyable, but so generic (with some dialogue so heavily laden with repetition it hurts), that they couldn't have made it more tired and trusted, if they tried.",4.0,Anonymous,Music

The Other Team,"Greetings again from the darkness. Just back from a screening and must admit that I was blown away by Christina Aguilera. The film is first and foremost a showcase of her talent ... and quite a talent she is!Ali (Aguilera) is a bored, small town Iowa girl who heads off to find the bright lights of L.A. She stumbles into a Burlesque club and is immediately enchanted by the songs, the dancers and the overall feel of the place. The club is co-owned by Tess (Cher) and her ex-husband Vince (Peter Gallagher) and is headed towards financial disaster. Local real estate developer Marcus (Eric Dane) rides in on a white horse and fat wallet and offers to rescue Tess and Vince. Of course, his plans for the club are anything but altruistic.Meanwhile, Marcus and Jack the bartender (Cam Gigandet) battle over Ali, though neither are very good at it. While that battle is going on Ali manages to beat out Nikki (Kristin Bell) for the spotlight on stage. This is when the movie really takes off, musically speaking.From a musical perspective, Cher belts out a couple of solos that easily convince that her pipes are still full strength. Her two songs are definite highlights and it's a pleasure to see her still in top form. Aguilera has so many numbers that I lost track. Most are average songs at best, but her voice is so unique and powerful that the non-descript songs come off fine.Must also mention Alan Cumming and especially Stanley Tucci. Mr. Tucci is clearly the best actor in the movie, though he basically reprises his character from The Devil Wears Prada.There will be comparisons to Dreamgirls, Moulin Rouge!, Cabaret and Chicago. Writer and first time director Steve Antin pretty much stays out of the way of Cher and Aguilera, while delivering the expected product to his intended audience ... not that there's anything wrong with it.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Burlesque: Just another Musical Movie,"Full review posted at shanatalks.wordpress.comWhen I heard that Cher and Christina Aguilera will team up for a movie, I initially thought ""What the heck? Is this another Glitter or Crossroads?"" Both movies didn't make it to the box office and I'm pretty sure that I'm not the only person who thinks both movies sucks. Those pop icons turned actress should have stuck with their forte—singing.I never really had any expectations when I watched the movie, so I hesitantly bought the DVD and after watching it—I'm singing ""yeah, yeah, yeah"".To be honest, Burlesque is not the best musical movie I watched (compared with Phantom of the Opera) but I can say it's not a bad movie either. I must admit it; I was not impressed with the movie's story because it's too common. A girl wants to make her dreams come true so she left her hometown, moved to the big city with no one else to turn to. She did find a place to call her own, found friends, family and a partner. Then she lives happily ever after. Very familiar? You bet it is.Though the movie's screenplay was pretty weak, I can say that the music used for the movie compensated what's lacking from its screenplay. The movie has strong numbers and there are songs that really made its mark to the movie goers. I loved Cher's performance of ""You Haven't Got The Best of Me"" and Christina's ""Show Me How to Burlesque"" number. I kept singing the line ""Let me hear you say, yeeaah!"" for hours. The movie did give me LSS (Last Song Syndrome).I really don't know if I can recommend this movie to everyone but if you're just looking for a movie that can entertain you and for you to pass the time; Burlesque is not a bad choice. If you love Broadway music, you'd certainly enjoy watching this; However, if you're the movie goer that won't settle for anything less, forget watching this movie.",,Anonymous,Music

"Burlesque is a fine showcase for Christina Aguilera and, especially, Cher","Just watched this ambitious Cher-Christina Aguilera musical drama with my theatre-working friend and we both found it fabulous! Is it a masterpiece?

But the leading performances of both are fine which also goes for the supporting turns by some of the above not to mention Kristen Bell and especially Stanley Tucci as the right hand man of Cher's at the club. And seeing both Ms. Aguilera and Cher singing their songs-especially the latter on ""You Haven't Seen the Last of Me""-are at their most compelling. There's also the requisite witty lines that make things go more smoothly as the narrative goes on.

Which brings up the questions-where are women led films from todays media moguls? This movie shows how it can be done-with someone of the awesome power of Christine and a showcase for veteran CHER, these ladies blow away the plot absurdity and the male cheesecake to rock out. If only Chicago had the dance and song power of these pieces, it would have been as great as everyone said it was. And if only some of the other great women songsters sitting at home were given this kind of raw musical showcase. This movie shows that as far as great vocalization. women hold there own and then some. Christine-you are a star. So there it is, some power music pieces, thrilling vocal fireworks, and a reworking of the R and B ""lady on fire"" legacy that goes back to the first blues shouters, moves through greats like Aretha and Sharon Jones, and becomes oh so real in this bit of very musical celluloid. Unlike Thanksgiving dinner, this warm meal left you wanting more. Much more.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Impressed,"I will be the first to say that I went into ""Burlesque"" with concerns (and resistance) that it will be this year's ""Glitter."" To say that pop stars playing the struggling small time girl that makes it big (""Crossroads"" anyone?) is a concept played over and over is an understatement. My reasons for worrying that this movie would do the same are not exactly unjustified, however I found myself actually enjoying this film and (dare I say) became immersed in Aguilera's character. While the movie has its flaws and could have done so much more with certain story lines, the film was generally well executed and a joy to experience. This is coming from someone who had no genuine desire to see it in the first place. Cher proves once again that she can carry a film and Aguilera shows room for growth. It will be interesting to see where she goes with a film that is not musically based. Overall I would recommend the film to those who want a good time and don't go in with unrealistic expectations. My advice is to take ""Burlesque"" for what it is: a bright light, bass pumping joyride centered around a big voiced diva pop star and an entertainment veteran doing what they do best.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
All That Glitters Is Not Always Gold.,"Since the advent of sound and the first Best Picture Oscar winner in the sound era (1929 winner ""The Broadway Melody""), Hollywood has been fascinated with the musical and namely the 'small-town girl has huge dreams in the big city' genre. The 2010 version of this sometimes-proved formula gives us ""Burlesque"", a film that wants to continue the trends of ""Moulin Rouge!"" and ""Chicago"", but looks more like the genre when it was fleeting through the 1970s and 1980s with that Bob Fosse take on the material. Christina Aguilera is that small-town Iowa girl (!?) who comes up with the idea out of the blue one day to leave the simple Midwest life for Los Angeles. Times are tough though as she has no luck until she wanders aimlessly into a nightclub that has the feel of Fosse's ""Cabaret"". There she encounters the club's owner and creative force (bravura role for Cher, doing her best work in two decades) and a whole array of fascinating characters (namely love interest/bartender Cam Gigandet and the scene-stealing Stanley Tucci). Inside the club, the typical soap operas play out with Aguilera wanting to be a star, Cher having her doubts, Cher's ex-husband Peter Gallagher worrying about the club's enormous debt, Aguilera having a rivalry with star attraction Kristen Bell, big-money sleaze-ball Eric Dane eyeing the club and many of the female performers for himself, Gigandet's long-distance relationship with fiancé Dianna Agron, and even an unplanned pregnancy via role player Julianne Hough, and so on. In the end there is nothing just earth-shattering here, but there is still something about this film that makes it pop nevertheless. The musical numbers and dance sequences can be looked upon as exciting or downright tiring, but the women do sizzle and keep the audience and intensity up throughout. Relative film-making newcomer Steve Antin (who directed the film and wrote the screenplay) shows kind of an intense MTV-styled 1980s consciousness which likely comes from his hay-day acting career during that decade (being in films such as ""The Goonies"" and ""The Accused""). Is the film successful in its goals? I think in this case it is up to the viewer and ultimately there were enough pluses for ""Burlesque"" to be one of the more guiltier pleasures of the past few years. 4 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,Music
Second time a charm,"I first saw this movie when it first came out at the movie theater I when it came out in 2010, and I remember I thought it was an okay movie, nothing special.But watching it for the second time today as a grown up, I have to say that this movie is a special one. It's fun, optimistic, feel good kind of movie. The music and beats were awesome, I just wished there are few more extravagant burlesque shows featured by both Christina and Cher, and few more original songs.Cher is a such a great actress, singer and performer, Christina has a great voice and burlesque shows fit her very well.You put Stanley in any movie and you know it will be good.Hey hey hey hey.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Burlesque - A Hoot and a Holler,Played a little hooky today and took my 23 year old niece to see Burlesque. We both enjoyed it - not because the writing was so smart or the plot so deep - it was just great fun. Predictable and I'm amazed it took $55mil to make. Be interesting if it breaks even. But I hope the studios keep making musicals that are both contemporary and a play on the past. It is fun to see spectacular dancing and amazing vocals. Cher is an entertainment icon we could enjoy forever. Christina needs to sharpen her acting to match her vocal strength. All of today's actors are being allowed to talk breathy - what is that spineless acting all about? The movie must have had something good going for it if an Aunt and her Niece both really had a terrific time. Thanks!,7.0,Anonymous,Music
It takes Tucci... for me not to kill myself!,"http://movieswithmitch.com/ Mitch Hansch ""It takes a LEGEND to make a STAR!"" It takes Stanley Tucci in this FILM for me not to blow my brains out all over my POPCORN! Out of the 2 stars I've given to ""Burlesque"" one goes just to Tucci's performance. As the calming stage manager of Cher's erotic dance club, he did just that- calm me. Making the film's talkie parts bearable with his immeasurable talent of being able to raise the performance of his co-stars and make it possible to almost enjoy the silly world around him.I'm definitely not the intended viewer for ""Burlesque"" but if a film's good, I'll appreciate it. Heck, if a film's so bad it's good, I'll appreciate that as well. But director Steve Antin couldn't even get that right, missing the mark on consistent camp and only succeeding in plain old bad filmmaking. This is no train wreck like ""Glitter"" or ""Showgirls"" but ""who cares"" sub-plot after ""who cares"" sub-plot along with stolen choreography from ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""Chicago"" make for a viewing experience that almost made my eyes rolling in the back of my head permanent.A Midwest (duh) waitress named Ali (Christina Aguilera) has big dreams and moves to Hollywood (dur), learns of the sexy and exotic world of Burlesque dancing and gets the bug (dur-dur), then through much begging is finally given a chance from club owner and star Tess (Cher) and finally a rival jealous dancer's attempt at treachery actually backfires allowing Ali to show off her awesome pipes that nobody knew about (dur, dur, dur). Throw in a romance with a hot bartender (Cam Gigandet) and Tess dealing with threats of her club's foreclosure and there you have it folks.In her film debut, Aguilera wasn't nearly as bad as I thought she would be. The ""dirrty"" girl isn't much for conveying lots of emotion unless it's up onstage singing but it's a smooth enough delivery that it doesn't take away too much focus. As her rival dancer puts it, played horribly obnoxious by Kristen Bell, ""she's a girl with mutant lungs"". Her famous lungs even had me bopping a little to the film's title song. How do you get Cher to return to her first full film since 1999's ""Tea with Mussolini"" and only give her two songs? One of them coming in my least favorite scene where the number is completely unrelated to the film and is just there because Antin remembered he had Cher in the movie. Cher, who has an Oscar, deserves some sort of award for taking on the horse crap dialogue she was forced to deliver.""But Mitch you're just a ruff and tuff man's-man that can slam a Smirnoff Ice like no one I've ever seen, this isn't the type of film you'd ever enjoy."" Wrong about never enjoying these kind of films . It's called ""Moulin Rouge"" and I'll watch it with you right now mister! Again, I'm not the intended demographic for ""Burlesque"". That intended group is people who enjoy crappy films.""This"" is intended for people who enjoy crappy films.﻿ Psalm 149:3",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Fun entertainment,"My niece wanted to see this since she's a Christina fan, and I guess I'm the Cher fan...so go figure. We've seen the story before. I liked this movie better than the remake of Fame. Sometimes Cher looked like a very good drag queen. Sometimes I felt like I was watching an MTV video. No one gets hit. No one really gets hurt. No one uses profanity much. The song and dance numbers are great to watch. I would've liked to have seen a more character driven story...something like Gypsy. It kinda ended pretty quick. Is it my imagination or does Stanley Tucci play a lot of gay characters? He looked sexy for an old guy! LOL! Oh, and Mr. Barbara Streisand had a small cameo...lol!This was a fun movie to watch!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Made ""Showgirls"" Seem Relatively Intriguing","I usually abide by that Beverly Hills Player maxim, ""Reward or ignore; never punish."" But sometimes I just =have= to vomit.

The movie, at least, actually has some moments, mostly when Cher is actually allowed to =be=... like Cher, as well as when Stanley Tucci is on screen.But some of the reviews here (as is often the case with ""diva flicks"" like this) are what I'd call ""hopefully projective"" (of circumstances that don't actually exist), ""delusionally enthusiastic,"" or maybe just confused and commenting on the wrong film.Aguilera is still in Disneyland. She =is= a fine (if over-reaching, even over-killing) vocal technician and stage performer, but willful reality suspension will be required to buy her characterization. Which is probably the director's fault, as much as her acting coach's.

Legit,"Over the last several years/decades, we've had various artists attempt musical comedy on film when they didn't, necessarily, have the talent to showcase in the film. It's almost killed the genre for me (which didn't have much going for it anyway).But when there is a legitimate talent to be featured or simply vehicled, show me where to buy a ticket. The young Christina Aguilera has nothing to prove vocally, but everything was riding on her ability to act on screen and hold our interest between songs. As well, I've always found her performances physically static, while vocally unimaginably executed, so when the trailer put her in a line of chorus girls in a burlesque house (which is showing a rivival of sorts in San Francisco), I did have a question about whether she could be compelling. I shouldn't have worried and wonder why no one hasn't grabbed her before now and put her on the screen. She's mesmerizing and surprisingly demure (which is not a problem she has in interviews on talk shows); and when she mounts the stage she controls everyone watching. Her dancing is quite acceptable and isn't accomplished in the editing room as recent filmed musicals have slipped less than talented actresses over hurdles they clearly couldn't scale.The story in ""Burlesque"" is a trifle, and no one tries to apologize for that. ""Showgirls"" tried to get around the limitations of this genre by adding scale and tawdriness and it only distanced us from any of the characters. The burlesque house here is modest, unapologetically copied from the Broadway show/film ""Cabaret,"" and the musical numbers scaled to a small stage that really's not much larger than an average film house's proscenium. It's a lesson directors of future musicals for film should learn. Keep it scaled down and accessible; otherwise, the audience and performers get overwhelmed and shut out. Here the talent of the dancers shines. The choreography is smart and sassy (as are the costumes), and I couldn't wait for the next numberwhich we're given a generous helping/selection of songs, all kept within the confines of the burlesque house.Is it revolutionary? No, but it's the best offering since ""Moulin Rouge,"" and I actually found this more appealing. I suspect the Golden Globes are going to eat this up, and that might give both Aguilera and Cher a shot at an Oscar nomination.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Bravo!!!     More, more!","BRAVO! How wonderful to see this lost art. Christina Aguilera was very smart to produce this terrific musical. Burlesque is unfamiliar to so many they may completely alien to its appeal. Not a strip club, but still very sexual in nature. The story behind it all was secondary, as in most musicals like Coyote Ugly. Burlesque has received many bad reviews I believe it does not deserve. Our most beloved and successful musicals started on Broadway, some made over and over again like Chicago, the others had much time to be adapted, to take out the slow periods, add more character to a character, rewrite parts, and take out bland numbers, jazz up other numbers like, to perfect them by the time they went to film like, Phantom of the Opera, Cats, A Chorus Line, My Fair Lady, Grease, All That Jazz and Chicago which ran three times on Broadway, once with Bob Fosse as the choreographer; this is why they are icons in our memory. Burlesque captured the music perfectly, the dancing not so bad, and absolutely the singing, the back story wasn't nurtured the way the rest of the movie was, but then, I didn't really expect it would. This generation doesn't not know anything about burlesque shows anyway, thank God we didn't have to endure any hokey comedians in between songs while the girls changed costumes. The cast was wonderful, the songs were great, and the choreography was so enjoyable. The back story, well give it a few runs on Broadway and let a few writers go through it and that will even be as nurtured as the rest of the movie. Christina Aguilera couldn't be lovelier and her voice is absolutely awesome. Cher, geez will she ever age? All though she seemed to lose her singer diva title next Christina's voice, but who wouldn't? How could Stanley Tucci be bad in anything? His performance was wonderful as usual. Cam Gigandet was not a complete new comer, but was great as the romantic lead. I think Christine was brave in backing this movie. When we all got to leave we all said, geez, I wish there was a place like to go to around here, we'd go in a minute. What fun to go to a Burlesque place on the weekend. Someone, please have the sense to open a few clubs like this!!",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Pleasantly surprised,"I can sum up this movie by saying that the music, dancing, choreography and singing was all very good. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie as it didn't really have a plot but it did showcase a lot of well thought out,dancing rotines that made this film worthy of a 7 star review .The entire cast and supporting cast were superb.This film really for mature audiences as their are sexual implications throughout the e tire movie. A real plausible look at the seedy side of Burlesque shows. Loved Cher's performance inthis film and enjoyed Christine Aguilera singing a d dancing routines. I highly recommend this film.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Musical movie with not so much plot,"She was a good singer but I am not that much of Christina's fan. Back in the day Genie in the Bottle I bought her CD because I liked the music, not because I liked her in particular when I was much younger and she has been singing for a long time. Just that this shouldn't have been a movie but a theater show as a musical Broadway type show and not a movie, as this does not have any plot other than cliches and predictable flat story worthy of a movie, where a poor girl from poor background from rural America from Iowa goes to LA to try out her luck. There is this rich much older guy who is a real estate businessman try to be friend with this poor young girl who is talented at singing, but she lives with her roommate who at the time was engaged to another woman, but secretly attracted to her, and you can imagine the rest. The young poor guy (bartender) wins the heart of the talented ""young"" woman (she wasn't a young woman when this movie was being filmed, just turning 30 years old). I liked Cher better who was the lounge owner of this Burlesque and she was a great singer in the movie and in real life, and played her role well. It was just that story is very flat and all you can expect is Christina Aguilera's singing and not much else with a few songs of Cher. I liked that they were not sleazy but tastefully dressed and didn't feel the cheapness of these show girls who often have drug/alcohol issues etc. In real life. Basically a very mild movie with no sadness or dramas in it. Someone said this film is for adults and not for kids LOL...well I want to say to him/her, you don't know what adult movies are like lol. Seriously. This is even for kids it's not a sleazy type film, with no sex appeal or actual sexual suggestive scenes at all. It is very innocent type Disney like movie where they have zero sex scenes nor revealing nature (and it is done tastefully and not in gross ways like Mike's Last Dance ...which was really gross and utterly inappropriate).

Pleasant but mediocre,"I think the general plot setup was decades old when used in ""Showgirls"" a decade ago. Except that the heroine in Showgirls had a dark side and was not a total saint. Christina did a fine job with the stock part she was given. It was also good to see Cher, but that's about all we did was see her. The leading men were picturesque, doing their part to ""flesh out"" the cast.I didn't hate the show: it was pleasant. There seemed to be more production numbers than usual, but given the rather routine non-musical scenes, that is probably not a complaint.My problem with the film was not the general unbelievability of the existence of a club with perhaps 20 tables, being able to support a technical production to rival a Broadway show: costumes, sets, lighting, etc., plus about six to eight dancers and a five or six piece band. The major deficiency was the script.Alan Cumming as the box-office person? From MC in ""Cabaret"" to ticket-taker here. I don't know who to blame for that.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Burlesque?,"I watched this movie last Wednesday because of a burlesque party that was organized that night. I wanted to get some inspiration for a costume, so what else to watch? If I should describe the movie in one word it would be 'fast'. The movie starts at a far away middle of nowhere town where you meet the usual-farm-girl-with-big-dreams (Christina). In 5 minutes she decides to go away and in less then five minutes she is in L.A., has an apartment and is looking for a job. The movie could better start at the minute where she arrives: that would be less fast.The whole movie goes fast and is really predictable, but is good enough to watch when you're having a girls night 'cause you can predict everything so quickly, you won't even have to pay attention to it.But well, doesn't Christina looks beautiful in all those costumes?",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Apply Razor To Wrists and Repeat,"So the walking dead Cher ('Laugh In') and Christina Aguilera want to make a movie? Here comes the pain baby here comes the pain! What's next? Pauly Shore teams up with Jerry Lewis?The plot: imagine every movie clichés in history. Small town girl wants to make it as star in the big city. An older mentor shows her the way. In Cher's case she's a really older mentor. The nightclub is about to be foreclosed on by evil greedy slime balls. Yup, that's the plot. There's nothing else to say.Now get ready for the celebrity cameos. I have no idea why they think they can save this movie. Have celebrity cameos ever saved any movie? Celebrity cameos have only ever worked in goofy comedies like 'Back To the Beach.' See what I mean? The best example of celebrity cameos in film history is 'Back To the Beach!' They don't work!So Christina Aguilera goes to work at a burlesque club in LA. And it's not a gay bar! WTF? Do burlesque shows even exist outside the gay night life? Even burlesque shows in Nazixploitation films are gay bars! Whatever.Cher has obviously had way to much plastic surgery and should accept her age gracefully.... Is what I said in 1985! In 2010 this is just ridiculous! Even the most die hard Cher fan is ashamed of the way she looks. Lucio Fulci had zombies that weren't as scary as her.So their nightclub is threatened by evil condo developers. How can they solve this problem? Put on a show of course! No! They don't do anything! Cher just talks the developer out of buying their nightclub. Yup, that's the climax.In summary, I've had root canals better than this film.

A cliché script dressed up in glitter and revealing outfits,"** out of (****)Going into Burlesque, one doesn't expect a contender for the Oscars. The mouth-watering fanboy at the box office expects to have a fulfilling time. After cinema's critical and financial flops about a girl moving into the big city hoping to get somewhere (""Showgirls"", ""Coyote Ugly"", ""Glitter""), can Burlesque break the mold? Unfortunately, not financially. With a poor one million dollar weekend opening on a mammoth of a budget (sixty million), Burlesque will go down as one of the year's biggest flops. And Burlesque isn't shaping up too well with critics (A 33% on Rotten Tomatoes, can you say ouch?). Well despite being a financial and critical flop, is there any sort of redemption with Burlesque? Well... sort of.As for the script, yes, it's as formulaic and paint-by-numbers as the critics make it out to be. There's no twist or turn the director throws. There's no surprise. It plays out exactly how you think it would. While the script is pretty flat, I thought the performances were very underrated. Critics are bashing Aguilera's acting yet I think she did her job. I'm usually picky when it comes to acting, but Aguilera didn't do so bad. Cher is really the life of the party here. She is full of charisma and she puts on a show. Still, the duo aren't too bad together. The dialogue on the other hand is a little cringe-worthy. You'll get a handful of cheesy lines here and there.For it being a big production musical, is the money well spent? Yes and I can say that with pride. The sets are certainly glamorous and you can tell every penny was used to perfection. Also, the visuals are pretty much eye-candy. The choreography is just as appealing as the set designs. Does the film deliver on its title? Unfortunately not. Burlesque lacks sex appeal to push the envelope like ""Nine"" did, but I suppose it didn't because they were going in a more family-friendly route. How's the direction? Pretty average. Steve Antin flies by Aguilera's past life and cuts to the chase. Apparently, he flies by a little too much and makes some situations seem pretty preposterous. Now most importantly, how are the songs? They are pretty fun, but you won't find any ""Chicago"" in these tracks.All in all, ""Burlesque"" might not have lived to its fullest potential, but for what it turned out to be, it wasn't so bad. After all, you could do a lot worse. The acting and dialogue are certainly eye-roll worthy but the choreography, flashy set-designs, and the fun songs are really what the audience lines up to see. While I don't think the film's quality is high enough to warrant a full price, I do recommend it this time as seeing the film with a big crowd might boost up your rating. It sure did with mine. It's not ""Chicago"" but it's certainly no ""Coyote Ugly"". Aguilera and Cher pretty much go out of their way to entertain you for two hours. If that's what you're looking for, ""Burlesque"" is right up your alley.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

Christina's voice is still incredible. The songs are not particularly interesting. Used to love Cher in her hey-day but now she's just a caricature of herself (plastic surgery and all) and it makes me wonder why she was ever a star. Her voice was always limited and she can't really act that well (despite her Oscar).If you like underdog stories this may appeal to you. It's just not the right vehicle for Chritina's first big role.

"Obviously the director/writer wanted to homage Bob Fosse girls, but this movie is pointless.","From the ads, this movie looked pretty fun. Christina Aguilera has a great voice, despite not always using it, and Cher is an American icon who has charmed us for over 2 centuries (close to it anyways), so mixing these two together in a ""Chicago"" inspired musical film seemed like it would be great fun. Unfortunately, in order to have a great film, you need great characters, an interesting plot, a clever script, and this movie has none of the above. It has a largely drama free plot, with boring one dimensional characters, and a script full of lame one liners. By the end, you just wonder, what was the point of all this?Ali (Christina Aguilera) is a small town Iowa waitress who wants to become a star, so she moves out to L.A., without a place to stay or much money. She ends up finding this burlesque house full of saucy female dancers straight out of the 1920s, owned by Tess (Cher), a boss with a heart of gold. She pushes her way into becoming a waitress for the place, and eventually tries out for a role on stage, while meanwhile she's living with bartender Jack (Cam Gigandet). Then rich businessman Marcus (Eric Dane) tries to buy out the Burlesque house...GASP...will he be able to?Writer/director Steve Antin's sole purpose for making this seems to be to homage Bob Fosse. Literally, there could be no other reason. Possibly as a way of meeting Christina Aguilera and Cher, but story wise, there is nothing here to tell. This movie has no point, and could have easily been condensed into a bland 30 minute short film. There's such little drama in the story, and nothing ever seems very serious. There's never a moment where you pity any characters, or feel bad for anyone, and there's never any moments where you feel particularly sad or happy for anyone. It's such a middling picture that it just moves along, doing nothing, and thus that's what you get from the picture...nothing.The performances are okay. Christina Aguilera is...okay. She's not great, and not bad. Her character is kind of irritating, and hard to describe. She's kind of pushy, and assertive, but also bossy, lazy and obnoxious. Cher's character is even harder to describe because she is given so few traits. Tess just kind of goes with the flow, and tries to run things, but gets frustrated. That's about it. And sadly, these two are the most developed characters. The performances reflect the lack of depth in the script, and everyone is just kind of hollow. It's like a script full of extras. We never get to know or care about anyone.Despite a not great script, and boring characters, at least we can get some great songs and stylistic direction, right? Well, inside the burlesque club, we get an atmospheric set with some alright songs and boringly shot dance numbers. But at least the club has it's own charm. But any set other than the club, is completely boring, and everything not featured there feels like a bad romantic comedy. And many scenes shot in there just waste time through songs that don't have any point. In ""Chicago"" or ""All that Jazz"" or ""Cabaret"", the songs in the film advance the plot, or tell us how a character feels, or set up some background information. Here, the songs do nothing but play as songs. They mean nothing to the film, and even less to the plot, and they are there to make this a ""musical"" and for padding. Like anything else, the songs have no purpose to the story.In order to create a work that replicates the works of Bob Fosse and Kander/Ebbs, one must not scratch the surface and say ""We need costumes, pretty girls, dance numbers and songs."", but instead one must listen to the lyrics and what they mean, and the wordplay, and watch how Fosse choreographed those routines, and in his films how he shot them. And of course, look at their plots, and how the songs have meaning to the plot, and how drama intensifies the film and makes the audience care. This movie is so bland, with boring characters and a plot that actually seems to give up on itself. You can't expect the musical numbers and costumes to run the show, but they do here. Quite a shame too. With all the talent involved this could have been great.My rating: * 1/2 out of ****. 100 mins. PG-13 for sexy costumes (really a mild film).",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Achieves its aims,"I try to judge movies against their aims and peer movies - horror film scary? - adventure exciting? So here a lightweight musical rom com and the good news is it totally succeeds. Measured against The Bodyguard which I personally detest the concept is lighter, and the performance better. Aguilera sings with volume, soul and depth throughout, totally convincing as a world class talent without lapsing into showboating. Stanley Tucci excels as ever and though I don't really care for Cher she is well cast as the mother figure. Yes the plot is thin and it's all just a bit frothy but it never set out to be Citizen Kane in the first place and I'm not going to score as if it did. - 8 stars.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
it's a lonely stretch to stardom,"Steven Antin's ""Burlesque"" has a routine plot - small town girl moves to Hollywood, hoping to make it big - and some interesting musical numbers, but overall the movie is hard to recommend. Probably because it makes everything look too easy. I personally thought that Stanley Tucci's character was the most interesting one in the movie, and I also liked Alan Cumming's character. I found the rest of the characters clichéd, and the movie generally seemed like something that I've seen many times on the screen. Your time would be better spent watching something else. Hell, if you're looking for a Cher movie, there's always ""Silkwood"", ""The Witches of Eastwick"" and ""Tea with Mussolini"".PS: Steven Antin played the jock in ""The Goonies""",3.0,Anonymous,Music
FABULOUS in every sense of the word!,"From the songs, to the costumes, to the makeup, right down to Christina herself this movie was fantastic!!! It was everything I hoped it would be! After seeing the very first previews I knew I absolutely had to see this. I have idolized Christina ever since she was just a young pop act new to the scene. I admired her for her talent and astronomical vocal ability. I didn't go see this movie to walk out and critique this girl's acting skills, she's clearly not pursuing an acting career anytime soon. Though she was not horrible, she was fairly decent for never having acted in any major picture before. Christina knows who she is, and in some ways the story line really reflects her own life. This movie just makes you want to learn all the words to the songs, and get on up and dance! Such a wonderful movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Burlesque - 1.5 Stars,"""Burlesque"" is a 119-minute movie that could have worked if it trimmed down around 60 minutes of its running time and became what it really wants to be; an exceedingly long music video starring Cher and Christina Aguilera. Whenever they're not singing, the movie attempts to lure us into a story that's not even good enough to be used in, uh, music videos.Aguilera plays Ali, a sweet young girl who works as a waitress in Iowa. This girl can sing, believe me. And dear Ali believes it too. That is why she quits her job and heads to Los Angeles hoping to fulfill her dream as a singer/dancer/performer. Ali eventually enters a club called, The Burlesque Lounge, and it is there where she wants to start.In these early scenes, we see Christina Aguilera projecting an uncanny charm. We see minimal make-up accompanied by some no, a lot, of clothes. Where were we? Oh, yeah. Pretty Ali desperately wants to work in Burlesque, and so she approaches Tess (Cher), the club owner, and does her best to convince Tess that she's Got What It Takes.Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/burlesque-movie-review/",3.0,Anonymous,Music
My 362nd Review: Perfect for teenage girls....,"Burlesque is exactly what we expected: both Aguilera and Cher do well - one thing is for sure - Aguilera gives it some shtick, but the film is nothing new, and you come away feeling like Coyote Ugly just went Burlesque.Both Allan Cumming and Stanley Tucci are way underused and the substance of the film is non-existent. What we end up with is really pop videos and an American Idol feeling.But it works.It's actually fun to watch and there are way worse ways to spend time with friends. Watching it alone just doesn't suit this at all - it screams for an audience.All in all, it's made for teenage girls who are having a film party, but lacks that Chicago kick that would take it to a sophisticated audience.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

Vanity Piece,"Lordy, this movie is special! The same way the ""special at the school cafeteria is always last week's leftovers, chopped up and baked into a casserole. But, at least everyone involved in this film seems to understand that it's just one, big, port-wine cheese ball with extra nuts. I take some comfort in this fact, because if not, this'd be the saddest production I've ever seen. Everyone's just trying so hard to be ""sexy."" But the movie actually works perfectly as a parody, even though I have a sneaking suspicion that Both Christina Aguilera and Cher are secretly quite pleased with how they looked on screen.I actually watched this movie at the request of one of my regular readers. She suspected (and was correct), that I'd have some pretty strong opinions about this little number. It certainly wasn't because she's a huge, secret Cher fan. So, like I said, I'm pretty sure that all the actors in this film were in on the joke. There's an awful lot of mugging for the camera, and general hamming it up. But, don't let that fool you into thinking that this will stop Christina or Cher from trying to nonchalantly out-diva each other throughout the whole film. Those gals are always finding some pretty flimsy excuses to give the audience some full-on, eyes closed, hand in the air, belt-it-out musical numbers. Of course, they always try to shrug these off later on. It's the musical equivalent of, ""Oh, this old thing?"" I guess it's pretty hard to turn off the inner drama queen. But then, these are two of the most notoriously vain women in show business we're dealing with.Then again, this movie really was designed just to be a vanity piece for these two. The story line is so clichéd and simple that we can safely ignore it, and focus on our leading ladies' glorious voices. Small-town girl moves to Los Angeles to become a star, and with a little dedication, and elbow grease, she rockets to celebrity, saving all the poor, downtrodden souls she meets on the way. And she finds true love too! You've seen it a thousand times before. But, have you seen Christina Aguilera and Cher's version? Have you seen it with sparkly lingerie and tons of bleached out hair? This is a film for die-hard fans only. But that's who it's really designed for anyway. It's just one, big, tongue-in-cheek wink right at both of these ladies' dedicated admirers.

"""An Eye-Popping Extravaganza, Encompassing Sheer Excellence - All In One, Effortless Experience.""","""A dream come true..."" were the first words I used to describe the spectacle that is 'Burlesque.' Never have I EVER been more captivated visually, mentally, emotionally, physically during a musical. Needless to say, this film exceeded my expectations. From the moment the film began, I was head over heels with excitement. Cher, Stanley Tucci deliver delectable performances, and to be honest, there are no weak acts in this feature film. The one and only, there never will be another, Christina Aguilera..., did not disappoint either.For Christina's feature film debut as an actress, she excelled in many aspects only some of her contemporaries could only dream of. Christina's performance was believable, sensational, emotionally investing, and left me begging for more. She demonstrated a wide range of talent in a well executed performance. She gives you raw emotion, a naive sensibility, cunning wit, an arresting presence, and bitchiness with a bite to back it up. I'm honestly not even certain if that covers it all or not, but you get my point. Christina's performance in 'Burlesque' is going to be a vehicle that will take her anywhere she wants to go in the acting realm of the entertainment world. Great job, Christina.The storyline, although predictable, aces the test in this type of format. Our story delivered in ways that capture your heart, body, soul, and mind. There are no stale aspects to this film as well. Most importantly, it's a believable piece of work that offers a little something for everyone. I was taken aback in some points of the film by how I was stunned or astonished at what was happening that either made me audibly gasp, or that literally took my breath away. There were also moments that had me welling up in tears, or exploding with laughter. A truly sensational experience. On the opposite side to the spectrum, there were a few moments that were a bit dorky, but all in all, this only added to the movie's charm.The musical numbers are sewn well together as well in the storyline and offer an insight into the feelings and emotions that are being enacted on screen. The editing is flawless and is another great job well done. The musical numbers surge with electrifying elements that really do make you want to ""get your ass up, and show me how you Burlesque.""'Burlesque,' I dare say, has redefined the musical as we know it.'Burlesque's' Overall Grade: 'A-'",10.0,Anonymous,Music
one of the most entertaining bad movies of the year,"Don't make any mistake that the vote is five out of ten on the scale. This is in fact not a very good movie. That is, when you stop to think about it. The screenplay by Steve Antin was very likely cooked up after a Cliff-Notes stop to Syd Field's book-of-wonders, and not the updated version but the one that gives you Screen writing-for-Real-Dummies (his only previous credit as writer/director is a direct-to-video sequel to The Glass House, a movie me and two other people on the planet saw in the first place). And maybe that's okay. In these tough times of depressing economic circumstances, maybe people need a little PG-13 escapism. Yes, escape from your dreary existence to see (almost) family-friendly risqué dancing from Christina Aguilera and Cher (or, holy-god-that's-Cher?)Ah, the story. The meat and potatoes of it is Aguilera's a small town girl, comes to LA, goes to the magically-out-of-ether apparent Burlesque club loaded with catty girl dancers and a few gay ones (Alan Cumming plays a Joel Grey out of Cabaret surrogate), and run by Cher, Stanley Tucci and sometimes-around Peter Gallagher. The club might close if more money doesn't come around! What to do? How about someone who can dance *and* sing. Gasp! In comes the incessant Aguilera, who in- between going all-out in her quest for acceptance roommates with a clueless guy who is engaged to a girl on the other side of the country, and shady real estate guy. One knows he's shady as Aguilera's character points out to him ""You're not the bad guy, you're the wrong one."" Touche, I guess.Don't come for the story, or much of the dialog, which has lines like ""Alice, hm? Well, welcome to Wonderland."" Actually, that's a white-lie. Do come for that, but not because it's particularly intelligent or wonderful. It's a lot of camp, the movie is. It is Showgirls-lite, which means it's neither anywhere near as mind-bogglingly awful, though not half as ambitious in its intentions. As I said, the movie is kind of ""safe"", in a sense. It could raise the ire of some hardcore Bible- thumpers, but that's about it. The sexual content is only on occasion actually sexually charged, and is otherwise playful (at one point Ali does a number where she's covered through most of it, but only by a sheet really, naked except for that and singing a sorta sultry song), like the music video from Moulin Rouge that Aguilera and her contemporaries made, Lady Marmlelade.Again, should I sell you on this movie? That depends. If you think there's something better to see, please, do so, by all means. It's like eating one of those pink-sugar things that's not even a twinkie but the counterpart that Woody Harrelson kept finding unfortunately in Zombieland. Cher, especially, as the co-star (though name above Aguilera), is prominently featured as one of the 'serious' actors of the film, though she too has lines that... well, I don't want to spoil, pshaw! As for her musical numbers, which is one of the more precise reasons that one could be curious to see the film, one is generic and one has no right being in a movie called burlesque as it's not burlesque nor good songwriting (""You Haven't Seen the Last of Me"" is the number, which has absolutely nothing to do with the film itself, only for Cher to have one other number than her Welcoming song that comes conveniently as Ali enters the club).Other numbers fare better, at least as far as being energetic, flashy, and showing off Aguilera's actual talent which, believe you me, is not acting. Luckily she's found a platform for her singing and dancing that works for her (unlike a certain Britney Spears from 2002's Crossroads, let's never mention it again). Her fans especially will be pleased to see her stretching her vocal chords and strutting her natural sexuality and appealing features for the camera. In a way these numbers do set off how much of the rest of the movie is either forgettable hooey or ridiculous trash. But hey, it's trash that doesn't kid itself; as far as bad movies go that are still out in theaters- or may be coming to DVD in a few months- it fares MUCH better than something like Skyline.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Fabulous (pardon the intended stereotypical expression),"I had my doubts walking into this film who wouldn't. Sure the trailers looks glitzy, fun and kinda silly but how often does that turn out well especially with the acting debut of a musical star. The film has so many things stacked against it and if I were to be extremely critical I'm sure I could pick apart the performances and generic somewhat clichéd plot but I had so much fun watching it I can't help but to give it the highest of my reccomendations and for so many reasons. First up here's the stick thin plot Poor girl named Ally(Aguleira) moves from Iowa to LA in pursuit of being a star. She comes across a flailing Burlesque club run by a tough as nails diva (Cher) who gives her a shot in the show and she ends up saving the club to some extent with her powerful voice. It all sounds fairly miserable I will admit. But the movie is told in such an energetic, visually exciting and light hearted way it's hard not too be instantly engaged by the films slightly amateur but exciting execution and dare I say it an engaging, charming but somewhat uneven lead performance from Christina Aguleira. there's some nice multi layered supporting turns from Kristen Bell, Stanley Tucci and a phenomenal much welcome share. And there's some delicious eye candy in the form of a scantily clad and one point nude Cam Gigandet of Twilight. The songs are fun, the choreography tight and exciting and the cinematography is so visually enticing from the a flashing light spectacle to the soft hues of a dark stage reflected off of Cher's facade during a powerful ballad. It's no doubt that the film definitely brings out the gay in and anyone who knows me knows it's also true that I relish camptastic films such as Showgirls, Elvira Mistress of the Dark, Rocky Horror Picture Show and Coyote Ugly among many others. And Like those films it's hard to see the bad in those films such as this one when I so completely enjoy them. there is a raw, seductive energy to this film and it feels fresh and unique. I'm afraid it might flop but it's no doubt prime real estate for cult status. It's everything I could have hoped for in all the right ways. It's fabulous!",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Didn't Like it,"I tried watching ""Burlesque"" on tv ten years ago and couldn't finish so when I saw it on again I thought I'd like to see the ending but once again it was tough to sit through and I had to fast forward some. For a musical I actually thought the non-musical aspects were fine, meaning the setting, plot, characters etc. But one big flaw I found was that the camerawork was shaky when characters were just talking in an office or offstage. That really bothered me, the shaky camerawork now so endemic is hard on the brain and eyes and is totally unnecessary, just get a tripod. The camera should mimic a human's vision as he stands or sits somewhere, meaning it isn't shaking all the time.The other flaw in this movie is that some of the music was not good. There were a few good songs, but mostly I didn't care for it. I don't like the style Christina employs often of shouting vibrato in a monotone way. It is weird and not melodious. Though I know that she can sing, but I don't like that stylistic choice. And she has this aggressive persona on stage that is too over the top, perhaps to compensate for her petite frame. But I liked her well enough off-stage. In summary, this film is not devoid of value, but I wouldn't recommend it for watching in more than 30 minute increments. My rating: 2/10.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
Admirable effort just isn't enough to save this movie from the trashy musical that it is!,"'BURLESQUE': Two Stars (Out of Five)Over the top musical depicting the glamorous life of a burlesque club in the 70's starring the aging ex-diva Cher and the past her prime pop singer Christina Aguilera. Aguilera is better than Britney Spears and a few other pop stars turned actresses but still not leading woman material. Cher has fun with her role but is uninspired. The film is filled with a much more talented and impressive supporting cast including Kristin Bell, Stanley Tucci, Peter Gallagher, Eric Dane, Cam Gigandet and Alan Cumming (who's performance is slightly reminiscent to Joel Grey's academy award winning turn as the 'Master of Ceremonies' in 'CABARET'). The film is written and directed by Steve Antin.The story revolves around a failing burlesque club ran by an ex-dancer named Tess (Cher). The club was popular in it's heyday but is now long past it's prime and struggling to stay in business. A local successful businessman (Dane) has offered to buy the club but Tess really doesn't want to give it up. A young girl from Iowa, named Ali (Aguilera), shows up looking to escape her past and falls in love with the burlesque life. She's given a shot at dancing, much too the disappointment of the club's pampered star Nikki (Bell) and the rivalry gets even more heated when Ali shows off her amazing singing voice and breaths new life into the club.The film is full of big numbers and lavish costumes and set designs but it really doesn't live up to it's promise of a big brash musical. The dialogue is intentionally funny and clever at times but also unintentionally laughable at others and the drama is a joke. The songs are mediocre at best although Aguilera does have a more than decent singing voice. Bell is great as the bitchy villainess and it's nice to see her breaking her type cast and getting away from the goody tushu princesses she usually plays. Although the movie probably would have been much better if her and Aguilera had switched roles. Tucci and Cumming are great as well as the rest of the supporting cast but their admirable effort just isn't enough to save this movie from the trashy musical that it is.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sd0S1srQ9T8",4.0,Anonymous,Music
A Classic,"From the opening scene where Christina sings ""Something's Got A Hold On Me"", you know you're in for a fun ride, this film is exactly what it set out to be, a fun no nonsense ride with great music.The acting is good and Christina is a lot better than other pop-stars who have ventured into acting like Britney or Mariah, it is something she should have done more of over the years.The film is very well choreographed and oozes sex appeal throughout, the songs are great though not having Cher and Christina duet was a giant error in judgement.I give this a 10/10 not because it's a perfect film but cause 12 years later it's something I still revisit and watch yearly.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
The first role of Cher since 1999.,"If you want to see a movie that brings out the mood and after the end leaves a strong desire to dance, then Burlesque, is the ideal choice.The beautiful girls, the costumes that leave no many in imagination, the nice choreographies, the uplifting music and the sexy atmosphere is unique characteristics of this musical, who certainly not bet at the script, which is irrelevant and banal, but at the debut of Christina Aguilera. Without being impressive and without being disappointing the famous singer, responds to a large extent at the demands of the role and of course a big help is her amazing voice. In contrast Cher is weak and is saved by the presence of Stanley Tucci, who even if repeats, always wins the spectators. The songs, while not affecting the aesthetics, they are all, irrelevant. Can for example the song lyrics, at «Nine» to be moderate, but by leaving the Cinema we humming 'Be Italian'. Here, unfortunately we have neither a memorable melody. Burlesque certainly not remembered for long -for men of course, quite the opposite will happen-but we had fun, although the whole show now seems somewhat obsolete.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

The Vidiot Reviews...,"BurlesqueThe difference between strippers and burlesque performers is that the latter have long tufts of thread growing out of their nipples.What's more, as this musical points out, burlesque performers also dance and sing – some better than others.Arriving in L.A. with dreams of making it as a singer, Ali (Christina Aguilera) is drawn towards the mystique of a local burlesque club.Determined to join the risqué revue, Ali begins to work at the club, despite the owner Tess' (Cher) objection.But when it becomes apparent Ali can sing better than the current lip-synching head dancer (Kristen Bell), Tess gives her the lead in hopes of raising enough capital to save the club from being torn down.While the story and acting is almost there, the musical performances by Cher and Aguilera keep Burlesque from becoming campy.Unfortunately, like burlesque itself, this movie will only interest gay men and overweight women.

Boo for Burlesque!,"The musical ""Borelesque"" I mean ""Burlesque"" was grotesque with its formulaic tune. ""Burlesque"" stars Cher as Tess, an L.A. burlesque-club owner who must come with a big show of cash in order to save her struggling club. However, the movie is really the showcase of Christina Aguilera who also stars as Ali, an aspiring singer-dancer who heads to L.A. from Iowa to make it big, what an innovative concept for a movie! Sorry, I used to work at Sarcasmesque. Anyways, Ali slips into Tess' club, and well you could figure out the rest. female protagonist stars with lousy job, her co-workers think she is a nobody, she meets a male friend, she gets a chance to show her talent, she makes it big, she falls for male friend, she has a jealous rival out to ruin her, she has conflict with lover, she has a conflict with her superior, problems eventually get solved and the rest is. well, you get the picture. Or maybe you should not get this picture. Writer-Director Steve Antin's directorial and screenplay ""Burlesque"" antics were making me hope that the show must not go on. I was not moonstruck with Cher's over-the-top performance as Tess; if I can turn back time, I would have fast forwarded all her scenes. Aguilera was not too shabby in her debut acting performance as Ali, but I was more impressed with the voice than the act. Stanley Tucci's performance as the club's gay fashion designer in ""Burlesque"" was dressed with the same characterization as his duplicate character in ""The Devil Wears Prada"". What's next ""Tucci Wears Gucci""; sorry Stan, I know you are a hell of an actor. Eric Dane seemed bored in his portrayal of Marcus, the wealthy magnate who is trying to buy Tess' club. Kristen Bell's work as the villainous dancer Nikki also danced itself with too many over-the-top moves. Cam Gigandet's performance as Ali's love interest Jack (who is also one of the club's bartenders) was a bit charismatic but not gigantic enough. The music of ""Burlesque"" was at zero level in my goose-bump meter. So I guess it does not take a rocket scientist to figure out that ""Burlesque"" to me was a near complete mess. ** Needs Improvement",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Surpassingly refreshing and and well done film that channels the likes of Chicago and and Pretty Women,"With a nod to the past and a glimpse to the future the Iconic girl power in this movie is both symbolic and surprisingly refreshing! You can almost see Cher hand down the torch to Christina Aguilera and you watch this visual spectacular extravaganza unfold scene after scene!When I first herd of this film being in production I immediately thought ""Oh God, GLITTER! or that horrible catastrophe CROSSROADS"" But, without giving away any details, I will say I was shocked! Christina came across as a natural talent. We all know she has a stunning voice but could she cut it with those acting chops!? Im going to say Yes! It was as if she has did this all before and as I watch, full expecting her to fall on her face, I fell in love with her not just as Ali, A small town girl who moves to Hollywood to chase her dreams, but as an actress! I believe this sis the start of a bright acting future for her!Cher was phenomenal as usual but we all knew that! Who better to play Xtina's, Mentor in the fill, Tess, then Cher? I want to keep this short and sweet so I will move on to the downers!Ali, Xtina's character Ali, was a little under developed. There was not enough Info about her past and who she was before deciding to Move to California. We have no idea how she crafted her skillful voice or why she decided to chase her dream. That only bad reflection on the writers which I'm sure was originally filmed but later cut on the editing floor, And lastly, This is a bit of a bash on Xtina but nothing to serious! Though I mentioned earlier was a natural to the acting game, she had one emotional scene that just didn't work for me. At some point she is crying on the shoulder of her love interest, Jack, and it was a little unbelievable! Bad acting a little! however I don't think it took away from the film as a whole and it was the only scene her inexperience was noticeable! I believe in the upcoming roles she will prefect this craft a little better!If you like romantic comedies this is the movie for you! Its fun and playful with great characters and story line and amazing songs and dance numbers to compliment the film! Mix in Kristin Bell, Stanley Tucci, Eric Daine, and Cam Garinet and you got an all star cast to round out the roster! Amazing musical film that is definitely a mist see!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Okay but not great,"Saw it with the wife. Not a bad film but not something I would see myself. I'm no fan of Cher or Christina. It wasn't offensive or extremely entertaining, just a movie made for fans of these singers. Cher, who I think it like 85, looks like a drag queen. She is not aging gracefully and is the perfect example of bad plastic surgery, however I do not deny her talent (but again, I'm not fan).The numbers are done well and again, this is a well made film but if you're not into this type of movie or either one of these singesr, this is a date movie at best. I saw many couples in the theater so I think it was all guys whose wives dragged them to see it, and some younger ""Glee"" type fans and fans of Christina. I did not see any guys with other guys although I'm sure in certain parts of the country, there was that in the theater too.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Hollywood musical with lots of kick.,"Cher is great in this movie. She should be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress. And the movie itself is wonderful. It's far-fetched, brassy, silly, wonderful. The musical numbers are incredible. Christine Aguilera is charming and wow, can she sing! Even the bad guy is wonderful. This is the type of movie that makes you feel like you don't want it to end. It offers nonstop music, melodramatics, silly scenes, and laughs. Stanley Tucci is great as Cher's assistant, friend, and confidante. Burlesque is larger than life, it's pure escapism. The musical numbers fill the screen, the music is loud, snappy and upbeat. The movie has no lulls, is entertaining, has a simple storyline and likable characters.

Good choreography and staging cannot make a film alone,"Being a Christina Agulera and Cher fan, the prospect of this film, and the trailer really enticed me to go and see it, however I was bitterly disappointed. Where the film really excels is on the stage. The dance routines are well choreographed and staged and do have an air of excitement about them, however once the heftier dialogue scenes took place you can see that neither the script nor the storyline have legs.The characters were very two-dimensional especially from the younger cast. Agulera's character didn't even seem to transition as she went from place to place, through each struggle. She played a so sweet she'd rot your teeth small town girl, with a big brain and big talent and her aggressive outbursts were laughable. Clearly Agulera does have a talent, which was over showcased, for singing. Her acting ability needs more work, her chemistry with the insanely good looking Cam Gigandet was as flat as the glass of coke thats been by my bed for 2 weeks. Other performers also failed to shine, Stanly Tucci who I am a fan of played his usual gay character with little enthusiasm and Kirsten Bell acting her abysmal dialogue as best she could.Cher clearly had the best character to work with, and played it reasonably well, and though with an inferior voice to Agulera, her numbers were a nice break from the excessive use of Agulera. Her face, however is so frozen in time that her acting ability is marred by the lack of expression her face can muster.The storyline was extremely weak and some of the scenes in the movie seemed to come straight out of the far superior Cabaret, starring Liza Minelli. Even though musicals don't have to have amazing story lines, it at least has to try and make the one it has as enjoyable as possible. Too much was crammed in. Several love affairs, the financial difficulties of the club, rivalry between the girls, hidden talents and friendships. Choosing one or two paths may have made this film far better, but it tried to fill too much into its excessive running time. The songs in the film though enjoyable were a little uninspired, and with Christina Agulera singing virtually every number they all start to sound a little too similar.All in all I really would not recommend this film, good song and dance sequences cannot lift this film from mediocrity and below. I went in knowing Christina Agulera had a good voice, I came out knowing nothing of the contrary. A little more scope and storyline could have made this film a whole lot more enjoyable. Instead I recommend watching Chicago or Cabaret again.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
The best musical you will ever see!,"I am dead serious, I saw this movie on Wednesday special preview of the showing. My husband who critiques every movie that we watch loved this movie and he is extremely picky. The music in this film was outstanding, and i can honestly say this film is my favorite movie ever. This movie will win awards for everything, wait in line when it premiers because it definitely will not let you downWhen the movie starts up you will instantly know what i am talking about, Christina Aguilara's voice is beautiful. As you hear her sing song after song you will not think that her voice will wow you anymore than it already had. Then when she sings the next song you are blown away once again. I love this movie, i will definitely go see it in the theaters a couple more times. Finally a movie i can call my favorite.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Burlesque:  Fabulous Film Magic,"If you wait out the first 7 minutes of cliché small town girl heads for the big city, you will experience a glorious musical with Cher and Christina Aguilera. Set on the Sunset Strip, Burlesque is the frisky flight of fantasy of writer/director Steve Antin (whose previous claim to fame was the jock jerk in ""Goonies"").There are some singer/actors that transcend their medium and undoubtedly Cher is one. Flawless at every point in the film Cher is memorizing in every scene she's in and in every song she sings.Christina Aguilera is astonishing as the ingénue turned star that demands attention through her character's pure heart and talent.I note early in this review that this is a flight of fantasy, because there are no scenes where Ali develops her talent for dancing and singing -- she starts and ends the film as talent personified. Having been a student at UCLA, I know all too well that talent and recognition are not compulsory companions. Burlesque is in the same vein of a Gary Marshall film (""Pretty Woman""), but sexier and sometimes smoking hot.Much of the sexual heat comes from Ms. Aguilera's on screen relationship with Cam Gigandet, who portrays Jack (the lead bartender at Burlesque). In a star making performance, Mr. Gigandet is more than just eye-candy for the divas; he is Ryan Phillippe in ""Cruel Intentions"", sexy, cool, smart, and a man anyone would long to wake up to and few other men could compete with.The supporting cast, most notably Stanley Tucci, is superb. Mr. Tucci consistently steels the screen film-after-film. I fear that much of Alan Cummings' performance was left on the cutting room floor. However, Mr. Antin leaves in one comic stage performance from Mr. Cummings that adds some levity to the film.Mr. Antin lends a steady hand from scene-to-scene and paces the film well at 100 minutes. The music and choreography are perfect at every turn.Trust me. Drink this film in like champagne, and try not to worry if it's real wine or not, because you will feel like continuing the celebration after the last credit rolls.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Struggles to find a consistent tone and pace, but has great musical sequences, and a likable cast.","It's not a perfect musical, but for it's momentary time, it proves to be a fun diversion.The film centers on an Iowa girl named Ali (Played by Christina Aguilera), who ditches her old life to chase stardom in L.A. Whilst there, she stumbles across a worn down Burlesque club run by a retired dancer named Tess (Played with relish by Cher). Ali, the headstrong career chaser she is, eventually gets a job at the club, and proves to be a dynamite singer, often getting on the wrong side of one of the club's main dancers, Nikki (Played by Kristen Bell), but the club is currently in danger of being closed down due to Tess's struggles to pay the bills for the club.The film takes obvious influence from it's more mature cousins, Chicago and Moulin Rouge (Right down to the bling-bling costumes, saucy choreography, and fast beat music), but the film's first half is more than sublime enough for fans of those two movies, if only the second half had done a little better. The film has a tendency to drag, and to feel contrived, but it's cast is enough reason to keep watching. Aguilera is clearly cast more for her voice than her acting chops (Which are actually better than expected), and it must be intimidating for any of the cast members to have to hold their ground against standout, Cher, a cast that also includes Stanley Tucci, Cam Gigandet and Alan Cumming.Oh, and as for the musical numbers, they're right up to par. They're decorated with shining, and lovely costumes and sets, and the accompanying lyrics and music, meshed together with the fast choreography should be enough to satisfy the fan of the musical genre. The movie specifically comes equipped with a beautiful ballad performed by Cher, and written by Diane Warren, that is by far and away one of the year's very best original songs. It's just such a shame that the film can't find a consistent tone.Burlesque is certainly not a good movie, but I enjoyed it enough to give it ** out of ****",5.0,Anonymous,Music

"""I'm so glad,"" Christina, ""that you're not gay""","Corny is the best way to describe this chiched melodrama where Tess (Cher) must pay her debt to the villain before he repossesses the nightclub and tears it down. Christine Agulera plays Ali, a waitress from a small town who struggles to find a part in showbiz until she finds the struggling backward-looking burlesque club Cher owns. Of course, the dancer she must replace is drunk too often so the lucky break is tossed in her lap. Ali eventually falls in love with Jack while staying at his place after her apartment is broken into. But when the two finally find the same bed, her most romantic words are ""I'm so glad you're not gay."" She repeats this again. He finally decides to break up with his jealous fiancé and become engaged to her. Ali spends so much time dumping ""don't bug me"" lines on all the guys, can we ask: Are Ali and Tess gay? Are they in love? Could Cher and Christina Agulera be gay? The dance numbers have all the sex appeal of cold water dumped in your face. Christina's acting skills have not grown much since she was in The New Mickey Mouse Club.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Burlesque barely misses the mark,"¨I'll be back, back on my feet. This is far from over. You haven't seen the last of me.¨ Burlesque is not actually as bad as I expected it to be, but it still has a long way to go if it wanted to revive a dying genre: musicals. Moulin Rouge and Chicago were actually great films and it seemed as if the musical genre was finally going to have a comeback at the beginning of the decade, but in recent years these films have disappointed (with Nine almost burying the genre altogether). We have a long way to go if we want to get back to the glory days of musicals from the 50s and 70s. My favorite musical all time is Oliver! and I just happened to watch that movie a few months ago, so it's a little unfair for me to judge Burlesque under those terms. The problem I have with musicals today is that most of the time the music is not part of the story, they are just there to entertain us and the story is told through acting, while on the other hand before each musical was used to tell the story and served a purpose. In Burlesque there are some good musical performances and fans of Christina Aguilera will probably be satisfied because she has several musical numbers and she is the main protagonist. This is her first acting job and she is not great, but her voice makes up for it and she does a lot of powerful singing. Fans of Cher might not be too excited because she has very little screen time and has only two musical performances (although ¨You Haven't Seen the Last of Me¨ is probably the best one of the movie and should receive an Oscar nomination for Best Song). Burlesque is Steve Antin's first feature film as a director and he also wrote the script for this movie. As a writer he hasn't had a very promising career (Chasing Papi and Glory anyone?), but this is perhaps his best work to date (not much of a compliment however).We are first introduced to Ali (Christina Aguilera), a waitress from a small town in Iowa who has big dreams and aspirations so she decides to move to Los Angeles. Once in LA she discovers a Burlesque club and immediately falls in love with it. The Burlesque Lounge is run by Tess (Cher) who owns half of the club- the other half belonging to her ex husband Vince (Peter Gallagher). Not everything is working out well for them as they are having great financial troubles and if they don't come up with the money they will have to sell the club. Marcus (Eric Dane) is a very successful businessman (and ladies man for that matter) who wants to buy the lounge for personal reasons, but Tess is not ready to give up on her dream. Ali finds a job in Burlesque as a waitress and befriends Jack (Cam Gigandet), the bartender with whom she moves in with. Ali is waiting for her shot to become one of the Burlesque girls and when the door opens she will stop at nothing to make the best of it. When Tess hears her voice she realizes that the show must revolve around her, but is it enough to save the club? The characters are one dimensional, but I'm guessing most people that go see Burlesque aren't expecting three dimensional characters, they just want to hear these girls sing. In my opinion the burlesque lounge began as one and somehow along the way it got lost and became a Christina Aguilera concert (even the stage seemed to get bigger). The film also seems to resolve itself rather easily by the end. The highlight of the film for me was Stanley Tucci's performance as Sean, the gay Stage Manager. Tucci is such a great actor and we have seen him give some terrific secondary performances before (The Devil Wears Prada) and he does so once again. The funniest moments of the film are thanks to him and he steals absolutely every scene he's in. Burlesque was worth it just for his performance alone, but then I am not a Christina Aguilera nor Cher fan so it did grow tiresome and long at times for me. Cher doesn't seem to have aged at all, she looks the same as she does ever since I can remember. Time seems to pass for everyone except for her. Her song ¨You haven't seen the last of me¨ was my favorite performance from the movie. The movie is about two hours long and after a while you begin to feel the length of the film. I wouldn't recommend this film unless you are a Christina Aguilera fan and in that case you will most probably enjoy her performance.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",5.0,Anonymous,Music

Glamour and Tucci,"""Burlesque"" is a musical drama that relies on glamorous costumes (or lack there of) combined with pretty women to captivate audiences. The songs are kind of bland throughout and because the girls' job at the Burlesque Lounge is literally lip sink to all of the classic songs no one is able to shine. Cher's character Tess gets a couple shots and really owns one of them while Christina Aguilera's character Ali is given numerous opportunities to sing. However, with only one star the rest of the girls are left behind in the shadows. The basic plot of the film begins as Ali quits her job in a small town in Iowa and moves to Los Angeles to make her singing and dancing dream come true. She has a lot of trouble at first, but finally finds Tess's Burlesque Lounge. There she meets a bartender named Jack (Cam Gigandet), Tess's gay studio partner Sean (Stanley Tucci), a snotty dancer named Nikki (Kristen Bell) and a very wealthy man named Marcus (Eric Dane). Rejected by Tess initially to join the show, Ali begs Jack to let her be a waitress for the Lounge. The Lounge is in great financial trouble and is going to be bought by Marcus if something cannot be done. Eventually Ali gets her shot and as her career starts flourishing the big question is if Ali, Sean and Tess are going to be able to save the Burlesque Lounge from Marcus's plans? Also, who will Ali fall in love with Marcus or Jack?The glamour of the film is undoubtedly the best part of the film and is very extensive and glamorous. The costumes exemplify exactly the kind of film that it is and are elaborate enough to brighten up the screen. The dancing and choreography is very good as well. And yes Christina Aguilera owns the screen when she is singing, dancing, and performing. Cher also very good, but she does not get as much screen time as she should. Kristen Bell is in familiar territory with her role that is almost a mirror image of her Sarah Marshall character. However, the standouts in the film are the three main males; Cam Gigandet, Eric Dane, and Stanley Tucci. They are able to shine through the estrogen filled screen with very good performances. Stanley Tucci is on top of his game year after year and this film is no different.The flare of the film is gone when the characters are not on performing in the Lounge causing the film to rely on Christina Aguilera's acting ability with little snippets of Cher and the three males as stated above. Aguilera does a much better job than other singers turned actress, however, the film is too much about her and only her forcing her to act more than she should have. It isn't even her fault that the film tends to struggle outside of its musical center because unlike Musicals like Chicago, Moulin Rouge or even last year's Nine (that probably wasn't as good as Burlesque) the film does not carry over the magic of the musical genre when outside the Lounge. The film breaks entirely out of the musical genre away from the light and color spectacle and becomes just another drama without the magic and mystery of music.A very entertaining film while in the Lounge, but the magic is lost once the actresses get off the stage and the performances of the film's males in a drama setting take over. This makes the film something that its not, but allows a man like Stanley Tucci a chance to show off a little bit. Therefore, ""Burlesque"" is not the must see musical of the season, however, it is the only musical and its more entertaining than last year's NINE. However, save some money wait for the dollar theaters or wait a little longer for DVD.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Best Musical of the Year!,"Burlesque, starring the fabulous Cher, Kristen Bell, Stanley Tucci, Cam Gigandet, Julianne Hough, and Alan Cummings, is without question the musical of the year! Now sure, there's not much competition. As a matter of fact, I'm failing at coming up with even one other musical from 2010, but that's beside the point. This is a quality musical!One of the major failures that modern musicals have suffered from is an inability to truly entertain the audience aka the fun factor. Burlesque embraces the fun, and even delivers on the wow factor in several of many balls to the wall dance numbers. There is no holding back on these performances. The success is the film's ability to go completely over the top in these sequences, yet pull back in the moments that call for it. It's a tricky balancing act that a lot of similar films have not been able to manage. They usually end up going the campy route (see Showgirls) or play it safe and deliver a snooze fest (see Glitter).Cher may be the big name in this movie, and she's great, but it's Cher. You know what to expect. The real surprise of Burlesque is Kristen Bell as Nikki. Just as Kristen Bell is not exactly the star of this show, Nikki finds herself left of center stage at The Burlesque Lounge. You get the sense that Nikki is completely aware of her destiny as a ""never was"", but she's going to make sure you know she's not happy about it.The only place the film is really lacking is in its script. There's some PG-13 level romance that never connects to the audience, and really only distracts from what we really want to see - great music and great dancing. Plus, the dialog is pretty stale, the kind of one-liners you'll hear on The Disney Channel. The exceptions here being Cher and Tucci, who sometimes feel like they brought in their own team of writers to handle the characters of Tess and Sean.Burlesque also marks the film debut of singer Christina Aguilera.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

decent,"This movie sort of reminded me of Coyote Ugly-a small-town girl moves to the big city with big dreams, winds up working at a place with a bunch of hot girls who dance a lot, she is flat broke (especially after her place gets broken into!), she finds love, and she helps her boss out. This was mostly a showcase for Christina Aguilera and Cher, both of whom actually turn in decent performances, as does most of the cast, especially Alan Cumming! Aguilera, desperate, joins Burlesque, first as a waitress, then as a a singer/dancer, and the lady she replaces (of course) tried to sabotage her. The place is in serious financial trouble, and she helps Cher-the owner-try and rescue it as the bad guys close in with plans to demolish it and set up other buildings on the site.

A Great Use of Musical Production and Movie Development,"26 November 2010. There are some amazing musical productions in this small, compact movie that captures some of the dazzle of best Oscar Picture CHICAGO (2002), particularly one of the earlier numbers using a similar flashy Richard Gere court revue. This is a more soft touch THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA (2006) as Christina Aquilera appears to get to escape the wrath of a devil and contend more with a softer version of Meryl Streep. The music itself doesn't quite have the poignancy and magic of MOULIN ROUGE (2001), the universal mass popularity of MAMMA MIA! (2008), and the haunting, ethereal sounds from THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA. This overly predictable musical, however extends itself in some great editing interspersing musical production numbers with movie scenes moving the storyline along and spends time on character plot development in a more convoluted path. The biggest weakness and one that makes its distractive presence noticeable is a technical one - the lip sinking. Even the first musical number is so disconnected between the acting and the singing that continues throughout much of the movie undercuts one of the crucial points of how BURLESQUE becomes more popular. There is also a weak scene in acting between Cher and Chirstina when the owner offers advice to her up and coming employee. The ending doesn't quite have the nice edgy feel of THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA and has a much more mass audience feels go ending and excludes that movies the dramatic collision with good and narcissism. Nevertheless, the energy, and entertainment value has bravado and power and compelling attraction.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Burlesque: The Edited, PG-13 Look Inside the Lounge","Burlesque is not a film for all audiences, and I'm willing to bet I'm the only fourteen year old who expressed an ounce of interest for this film. It's a musical/dance number that is constructed much like the 2002 hit Chicago. Beautiful women, catchy score, and a very involving story line. While 2010 has certainly offered better, if no musical comes out that's surpasses this one, I can easily say that ""Burlesque"" is the best musical of this year.Cher, in the music world, is outstanding. Cher, in the film world, isn't so hot. She's done some winners and some losers like many actors/actresses, but it seems her filmography is always underrated and shed away compared to her discography. This is the first time I've seen Cher in a film since Stuck on You in 2003. I have been known to like her and enjoy her music. Burlesque shows off her inner talent and your eyes will be glues to her every time she steps onto the screen. Something about her voice, passion, (plastic) face, and apparel makes her an immediate site of attraction. I will also say that Welcome to Burlesque is my favorite song in this film as well.The story follows Ali (Xtina) who escapes her life at a local dinner to head to Los Angeles to find herself at the Burlesque Lounge where she winds up meeting the club's firm but fair headliner Tess (Cher). As events go on, Ali impresses Tess with her strong voice and high passion for singing and makes her part of the dancing team. Ali finally gets the break she's been waiting for when she can express herself and show the Burlesque Lounge what she's made of.Unfortunately, the club is ailing and the future is looking so high, but with Cher running the club anything can happen. While it's the cliché ""showing people your true talent"" scheme it's shown to us in a very musical style which is something I don't see too often. I'd see this five times before I sit in the theater for Country Strong.The score for Burlesque completes the film. No song is truly memorable, but for the film both Cher and Xtina provide some impressive vocals, especially Cher who has some dark/eerie singing abilities. Too bad most of the songs are occupied by the young blood rather than the pioneer. Xtina does a fine job at acting, but Cher was the true highlight/standout of the film.Burlesque runs one minute shy of two hours, which for a musical is a bit lengthy, especially when the overall story isn't utilized to the fullest. I'd have like to see more of the girl's lives outside of Burlesque rather than see Xtina so much. It's nothing I'd watch/buy on DVD, but Burlesque proves to be more than the trailers show. It's a decent movie to wrap up Thanksgiving, but definitely not a film for everyone. The Sound of Music fans may be disappointed. Chicago fans might appreciate it.Starring: Cher, Christina Aguilera, Eric Dane, Cam Gigandet, and Julianne Hough. Directed by: Steve Antin.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Best Musical Since Funny Girl,"Growing up in the 60's I went to see ""Burlesque"" because of Cher. I walked out hopelessly in love with Christina Aguilera. For over a decade now I have wrongfully categorized this beautiful and talented young women in a group with the likes of other blonde paparazzi favorites like Britney Spears, Jessica Simpson, Lady Gaga, et al. To atone for this sin, I immediately ordered three of her albums. I can add little to the earlier rave reviews of this film, other than to say it was 100 minutes of sheer joy. Anyone complaining about this movie's plot should never, ever be allowed into a musical.

Wonderful Updated Musical,"Since society is enthralled by glorified, flashy material, it's no surprise that musicals have veered from performing typical upstanding show tunes and wholesome dances to much more modern and scandalous versions, as shown with the movie Burlesque. The classical musical is all grown up, and Burlesque is the perfect movie to showcase the features of the updated musical.As the movie begins, the audience can't help but inwardly groan to themselves, as Burlesque seems to be just another cliché about an aspiring young woman trying to make it in Hollywood as a performer. The standard, boring storyline. However, as the movie progresses the audience realizes there is much more to it than meets the eye, exemplifying a plot twist found in most flicks nowadays. The story of the main character, Ali, trying to succeed in Hollywood by performing at the Burlesque night club quickly spirals into a struggle to save that beloved club.Although the plot lacked substantial substance and there was no ulterior motive for the production of the movie, the chemistry of the characters combined with fabulous musical numbers and costumes made for excellent entertainment. Christina Aguilera, who played the role of Ali, was the ultimate combination of sexy and sweet. Her character had a certain charisma about her; a mix of sheer determination, stubbornness, and confidence made her immediately likable. Cher played Tess, the Burlesque night club owner, and even though her untraditional beauty is off-putting at first, the audience grows to love her as she becomes a mentor for Ali.And of course, no one can forget about Jack. Played by actor Cam Gigandet, Jack is much more than just flawlessly sculpted muscles, a chiseled jaw line, and piercing eyes. He's the good guy in Ali's life (even though she doesn't realize it). The audience encourages his blooming feelings for Ali, since we recognize that he treats her right and makes her happy.Pushup bras and skimpy costumes that could easily be mistaken for lingerie are omnipresent throughout the movie, but with the expertly choreographed dances and Christina Aguilera's unbelievable voice (especially a breathtaking a cappella solo), the movie manages to keep the movie tasteful as much as possible. All the sparkles, sequins, and glamorous sets will not fail to make everyone, regardless of age or sex, wish they could have their moment on stage just like the girls in Burlesque.If you're looking for a movie that you need to be actively and continuously processing in order to understand the story, Burlesque is not the movie for you. Rather, Burlesque allows the audience to passively and comfortably watch, but as they do, their mind can't help but wonder if the dreams they've been holding back on can truly be achieved after all.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Cher and xtina are the queens of burlesque and this movie is legendary and iconic... anyone who says otherwise is completely wrong and i will defend that to my death! Burlesque is a movie everyone needs to see and i hope they do... cher and christina is the greatest duo i never knew i needed... plus julienne hough! And kristen stewart... miss veronica mars herself! Also mark sloan in the flesh... the cast cannot be topped and i force this movie upon anyone who have not seen it.,10.0,Anonymous,Music
I enjoyed Cher and Stanley,"The movie is pure fun and pure escapism. Christina was good....it would be so unfair if she were nominated for a Razzie, because she acquits herself well, if not spectacularly. Supporting cast was good. What was the best thing about this movie? Cher and Stanley Tucci. They had a terrific chemistry, and this is the main reason for seeing this movie. I wish there had been way more of them.....theirs was the relationship I wanted to see more of. Their work on screen is an example of two really fine actors rising above a mediocre script. And what did they do with Alan Cummings' role? He was barely in the movie. Biggest missed opportunity? The duet with Christina and Cher....I really missed this. A duet should have ended this film. What were they thinking by not including one????",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Wow! Loved the singing and dancing!,"We loved the singing and dancing in the movie as well as the great performances. The plot line was a bit predictable but we were carried along by the music. We came to appreciate Christina much more after seeing more than just a single music performance. Her singing was out of this world ,the dance numbers were extremely well choreographed and the sets kept getting better. We liked Cher as well - still great pipes. Watched her all the time on the Sonny and Cher show so have appreciated her voice for many years. We plan to watch this movie again just to feel good!

Hot.Hot.Hot,"I have no idea why this movie is rated as a 6 it has to be at least an 8. Of course it is not the deepest or most meaningful movie out there, but it does it's job which is to entertain.This movie was almost 2 hour long and it passed by like 10 minutes! I actually did not want it to end. It was just so much FUN! The dancing, the music and the performance overall was mind-blowing. And the costumes were to die for!The movie was extremely steamy and hot without any nudity. Everyone in the movie is super good-looking which for me was a complete +1! It's just so much fun, the story isn't WOW but the movie was just great for its genre.Christina -eventhough is not the best actress out there- was great for her role, because seriously she was gorgeous and her voice makes you tingle! And Cher as always is perfection.Definitely going to see it twice!

The only good musical since Chicago,"The movie definitely delivers to it's target audience i.e. Xtina fans, women and gay men. I find that mainly straight men are knocking this piece of art. It's a great movie, excellent cast, actors, plot and musical numbers. My opinion is biased considering I pass 2 of the categories of the film's target group. However let me add, I saw this movie with a few ladies. Meaning I persuaded them to come along, and I heard words uttered like, ""Wow I wish I was one of those girls"" (before the ending of the opening credits) and ""I wish I was Ally"". In my opinion this is a manifestation of Xtina's transformation from recording mega legend to movie stardom. It also shows you how much the movie connected with the audience and provided that level of escapism that we all look for in films. Guys if you were expecting Xtina to appear nude go watch Showgirls or if you want action watch a Jason Statham flick. If you want to see an incredibly well done musical, chick flick you've made the right choice. Finally for the Cam Gigandet fans you definitely will Not be disappointed.Xtina is the name Christina Aguilera goes by as her fans will tell you.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
tired of critics,"read the critics, almost didn't see the movie, glad i did. it was fun, the dancing was AMAZING, the singing was AMAZING, which is why you go see aguilera and cher. so what if the plot was standard? hello? who cares? it moved along, stanley tucci rocks, cher still has it, there wasn't so much singing aka musicals that i wanted to to tear my hair out, choreography was top notch. you want to cheer and clap throughout the movie. i took my daughters, 15 and 18 with me, and they were not bored for a second. it was a bit risqué in places, but nothing blatant or gratuitous. the characters had depth, there was not much language to worry about and no gratuitous cussing either. i was very pleased about that since gratuitous cussing and nudity will make me leave a movie quickly. cher's song was very well done...i only wish it had been done live during filming as her voice is strong and phenomenal. i really enjoyed the film. well done.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Enjoyable - a real treat,Aguilera is multi talented - she can belt it out in different styles and act as well. The dance and song numbers are over the top and well choreographed. The camera angles were good - didn't jump around much like some of the recent musicals like Chicago.The supporting cast is top notch. Cher is a bit facially frozen but she is amusing to watch. Kristin Bell is a surprise here - who knew she had the vamp in her. Tucci and Gallagher are good. Eric Dane is just sleazy enough. Cam Gigandet is a cool boyfriend.Loved the old fashioned feel good storyline and neat plot. The romance is lighthearted and predictable in a good way. No ugly characters and unnecessary angst. The dialog is quite fun and witty throughout. It was like watching a good Broadway musical but with a more attractive cast.One of the more enjoyable musical movies of the past few years.,9.0,Anonymous,Music

Perfect Romantic Movie to take your Date to,"Musical at its best. Very beautiful images. Great songs. No evil characters or major conflicts in the plot (in my opinion). Everything is so smooth and nice and cheesy. Very relaxing. This is the perfect movie to take your date to, (even though I did not have a chance). Reminds me of the the Sound of Music very much. The movie takes the viewer to a different world, where everyone is a friend, where people care about each other and sings and dance. The only part that I did not like was the presence of homosexuality. I think it was out of place completely, but did not spoil the overall romantic relaxing mood of the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Christina Aguilera Is Excellent!,"This is a fun movie! Cher is Cher - only a couple of singing numbers - one a bit pedestrian; the other a show stopper, a bit melancholy, but perfect - she can still sing!Now, a singer? Perhaps Christina Aguilera? No perhaps! She takes over this film and makes it hers with her surprisingly good acting and powerful voice.OK, so Cher can still sing a bit and Christina Aguilera can sing a lot. Is there to be no mention of great acting? Hold the presses! Can anyone spell Stanley Tucci??? He is no less than magnificent. An absolutely perfect role for him which he takes and runs with - certainly supporting Oscar nomination material.The story is a bit worn - girl from small town America goes to the big city to make her name as a singer. Against all odds, everything falls into place for her and she succeeds. The club owner faces losing the club; yet, thanks to small town girl, saves it and makes it better.Totally clichéd; yet, this movie is a lot of fun to watch. Toe tapping tunes (well, OK, a bit more than toe tapping), success against adversity, small town girl makes good - what else do you need?What else? How about fantastic dance numbers? Pounding, vibrant music?Oops! Almost forgot - this is a movie with Cher, right? Suffice it to say that the costuming was outrageously wonderful.All in all, this is a wonderful film - light weight, low-key and totally enjoyable.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

But overall I loved the movie as a whole.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Sing and dance,"And I guess act - I mean we know Christina Aguilera can do the singing and the dancing, but I don't think we knew she can act too. Though to be fair, she was surrounded by so many great actors - that alone helped a lot I reckon. Stanley Tucci along is as good as he always is and he only seems to be a stand by guy - a prop if you were mean. But of course he is so much more than that.And Christinas character is so much more than the waitress she is being hired to be at first. I would argue there are not too many surprises here. Unless you did not think about the outfits and the sexual energy this is creating (without showing actual nudity - or what would be considered nudity nowadays of course - for some what is shown may still be too much skin).So suspend your disbelief and just enjoy the story that is more than entertaining enough. Yes you know the beats (and the songs, pun intended), but the ride and dance are fun to watch ... and hear!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Great Broadway musical,"I think this movie is a great one to see. It is better than A Chorous Line because it shows more women than men. Christina Agularia can sing in this Broadway musical because she not only has singing talent, but dancing talent, which makes her excellent for many Broadway musicals. Many people worldwide would love to see this movie even if they are big Burlesque or any other Broadway musical fans. Even if Jessica Simpson and Britney Spears would do many other Broadway musicals because they also have both singing and dancing talent. Watch this movie more often, I think you will never get enough of Christina Agularia even if you are big Christina Agularia fans. Let this movie be Screen Gems biggest box office hit surpassing the Broadway musical Chicago.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
what do the critics know?,"What do the critics who panned BURLESQUE know about a vastly entertaining movie that's a good love story with some incredible choreography? NOTHING! They are so focused on how their own expectations were unmet that they failed to enjoy and appreciate some terrific acting, dragging the movie through the garbage of their own sour attitudes and unmet expectations I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and how the small town girl used her inborn chutzpah to take over an unmet need in the nightclub she was drawn to. Triumph of the human spirit and all that! Christina Aguilera never looked or sounded better and Cher was great too. Good to see Cam Gigandet as a human without the TWILIGHT vampire disposition. Nice to know he can act, too! Altogether an entertaining movie worth numerous viewings of the DVD and much more positive attention than the so-called critics could ever muster!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Thoroughly Entertaining,"Ali (Aquilera) goes to Los Angeles to make it big as a singer/dancer. She becomes a waitress in Tess' (Cher) burlesque club and later becomes the star.Good music, dancing, acting, script, dialogue and some funny lines make this as good as CHICAGO.I was caught off guard for a minute. Burlesque in California, why not the east coast where Burlesque ruled for a time? And, if I heard correctly, the performers lip-synced the songs for the customers because this was really a strip club, but no one stripped. I kept watch for that. Nada., nothing, zeroBurlesque, as I had heard, had comedians as well as song and dance girls. Not in here. But, the music was of such a toe-tapping nature, we didn't miss the comedians. All was good. I have new respect for Christina Aquilera. The girl can sing. Maybe a few acting lessons are in her future, but she held her own. And, Cher sang the opening song and I kept hoping for more of her singing. She did sing one more song later on and WHAT A TALENT !! Can't say enough about her singing. And, her acting is right up there too.What really made this good with excellent pace was the story interspersed among song and dance acts. Very lively, very real, and very good.

"Great ""MOVIE""","I'm shocked at some of the other reviews. This was a movie and thats all it was. I'm sure the director had no intention of reminding you of your past in the real Burlesque world. IT WAS JUST A MOVIE... It was a great movie, will there be academy awards for Christina, probably not, but she did a great job. She played the part well, I wasn't expecting nearly that much from her. The Characters are great, the story is cliché but thats what makes it so good for a movie. My only advice(to those who haven't seen it) is if you wanna see a movie to make you escape reality for a while and to put a smile on your face then go see this movie...its well worth it. If you want to go see a documentary based on the true life facts as written or told by people in the burlesque business...then go see another movie",10.0,Anonymous,Music

I have watched this film many times and it always cheers me up, and what are films for but to make you engage with them on whatever level works for you. The music is just amazing, my only regret is that there is not more to enjoy. Christina's voice is so powerful and combined with Cher, who should have had more songs, is just genius. Stanley Tucci is the standout male performer who, with Cher, enjoys a great double act with great dialogue. If you haven't seen this film, do so without delay!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Music

I love her!Tess (Cher) character could have been better, I mean the plot, but she is truly good. The solo performance part is really touching and it got to me quite deeply.Tucci was the only male character that I remembered from this film, except for the cirque guy who was quite good in fact.The movie is worth the time and money just for the visual and acoustic effects.

Burlesque exceeds my expectations by far,"Although I read a fairly good amount of negative reviews, I still decided to go see Burlesque with my friends. To my surprise, I sat in the theater for almost 2 hours truly amazed by this movie. It is a cliché, a familiar theme that has been told before. Nowadays, a lot of movies are clichés. And there are quite a few remakes also. However the movie is truly entertaining, fun, interesting. The singing, dancing, dialogue, acting ... are all excellent. Christina and Cher deliver some great songs. The chemistry between Christina and Cam Gigandet is adorable. Cam Gigandet is by far my favorite actor of all time. I am so happy to see him have decent screen time, and to see him perform such a lovable strip scene. I could have paid $500 just to see his Famous Amos cookies scene. I give 10/10. I anxiously wait for the DVD to be released.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Entertaining and fun,"The biggest surprise for me was Christine Aguilera's performance as an actress. She did very well. There are many actors who get regular gigs and have less talent. She was able to show off her range as a singer. She proved she is not just a Pop singer. For her debut in acting on the big screen, she did a really good job.Cher is showing her age but still put out a solid acting and singing performance. Other than the two main actresses, there are two actors who really kept the film moving and enjoyable with a fair share of the laughs: Stanley Tucci and Alan Cumming.The casting was very good. The above two gems of supporting actors really helped the film overall. The director kept the film about the story, and not the costumes and burlesque theme.The music selections and choreography were quite enjoyable. Sure the style and feel may have been seen in other productions, but they are still fun to watch. Plus, how often do you get to see Cher perform with the polish of a major movie production? This is certainly a movie to go see and have fun with. It is not just a ""date"" movie. By the reaction of the females in the theatre, it would seem there is more eye candy for the women. The guys will enjoy it too.If you like the TV show Glee or the movie Chicago, this movie will be worth catching on the big screen.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Christina A, first time to the screen deserves a lot of credit. Welcome back Cher. The bar guy plays a great part and add's spice to the movie. The supporting actresses which are the other Burleque dancers add that bitch factor which everyone loves to hate. Overall this is a great movie.

Down and Out Good Fun!,"BURLESQUE, written and directed by Steve Antin, is a terrific cinematic definition of what the word 'burlesque' means: 'a literary, dramatic or musical work intended to cause laughter by caricaturing the manner or spirit of serious works, or by ludicrous treatment of their subjects. The word derives from the Italian burlesco, which itself derives from the Italian burla - a joke, ridicule or mockery.' This is a riot of color and good fun and snazzy production numbers a la Bob Fosse takeoffs. The story is predictable and silly and the script borders on mediocre, but with the talent and pizazz of the cast, none of that matters!Ali (Christine Aguilera) flees Iowa in hopes of a career in show biz and happens into a Sunset Strip Burlesque House run by 'still not down' Tess (Cher) who knows her business is failing, despite the solid help from her gay assistant Sean (Stanley Tucci) and the warnings of her ex- husband/partner Vince (Peter Gallagher). Tess has problems with some of her lip-synching cast, namely Nikki (Kristen Bell), and is being hounded to sell her club to the wealthy boyfriend of Nikki - Marcus (Eric Dane). Ali observes, wants to be in the show, but is offered the job of waitress in the club by bartender/songwriter Jack (Cam Gigandet), a guy so kind that he shares his little flat with her. Ali is persistent and when given a chance to audition she gets into the cast. Her trump card is that she is such a terrific singer that she converts the club away from lip-synching into a full-blown song and dance place. Romance of course flutters in as do other little sidebars (including a strange quickie by doorman Alexis (Alan Cumming), but the main attractions are the glitzy stage numbers by a surprisingly fine Aguilera and by Cher herself. It is all very corny and very wonderful entertainment. Definitely worth an evening's pleasure.Grady Harp",10.0,Anonymous,Music

The never-ending dispute,"I read some quite negative comments about this movie. With which I do no agree. As we all know, there are all sorts of people, leading to all sorts of taste. A taste in everything. With that being said, here are my 2 cents to this movie and to movies as a whole, I'm not obliging anyone to agree to it, but I'd love it if I am able to make someone consider things from a different point of view. So.. To me there's always a dispute between the overall impact of a movie, meaning how it made you feel, if it did at all, and how well are all of the building parts of a movie delivered (producing, directing, cinematography, views, music, blah-blah, you get the idea). Let me give you a fast example - Slumdog Millionaire. THE MOST overrated movie ever, for me at least. I get it that for the low budget Danny Boyle had at his disposal, he did something like a miracle, but.. actually that's all. I don't really care about that. This movie couldn't make me taste not one single feeling throughout the whole god damn movie. I'd rather have Hollywood spending 1 billion dollars on making a movie, that's gonna make me shed a tear, get on the edge of my seat or make me shiver. I hope now you'll get my point of view on ranking movies. Since I'm judging by.. well, let's say - feelings brought to me through the screen, I was overwhelmed by this movie. On several occasions I was either holding the seat tight, crying, or just staring with pleasure at the big white screen. All of the songs in the movie were, in my opinion, great, greatly performed and, well, greatly influential. Might be that I'm really into music, but that's ""a might"". Christina has a great voice and all the times she had to sing high notes, she gave me the chills. Cher, although not singing as much as her, gave a great performance as well. I loved this movie.

Its country girl goes to L A - BUT the plot is not tired at the breakneck speed of the music and fabulous editing. It is visually stunning and visually interesting. The club set is a masterpiece with lighting highlighting the dance routines. For its genre this movie is a prize. And p.s., Christina Aguilera hit every song out of the ballpark as Cher did with the title song. Plus you get Stanley Tucci.The down side - Cher has a second number that is clearly stuck in there to give her a second number. I thought it the weakest song in the movie. The movie is PG 13.

Best Musical in Years,"This was the best musical I have seen in years! The plot was excellent and Christina did a wonderful job as Executive Musical Producer! It was such a great movie I had to watch it 3 times in one day! It did not receive great reviews overall but I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and the soundtrack! The cast was great and for Christina's first film, I thought she was awesome! I hope to see her in more movies! I believe this is a must see for anyone who just loves movies!!!!! Cher was awesome as well! Her voice just seems to be like wine - it just gets better with time. My kid even enjoyed her voice and he thought she was just way too old to be singing! It was a very fun movie. I wish I had gone to the theater to see it. I think I would have enjoyed it even more at the theater! Jack was such a sweetheart to take her in when she had no one - so sweet! Just an all around wholesome movie for the entire family. I do not believe there was even any profanity in the movie! AWESOME!!!! The best scene of the movie was Bound to You with Christina in her green dress with the lights behind her. So yes, the lighting was great as well - although I've never done anything with lighting in movies! Thank you for a wonderfully done movie in todays society where most movies are about sex, drugs, violence, and vampires! This was a true joy!!! THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!!

Not Bad--Pleasant Enough Entertainment,"As I said: not bad and peasant enough entertainment. A story about a young girl who goes to Hollywood from Iowa to find herself, enter show business and be a star, more or less, coupled with how a former dancer needs to get money together to pay her mortgage and other expenses, more or less, to save her night club, called Burlesque, from becoming an office building. I never was much of a fan of Christina Aguilera, but I clearly see from this movie that she is quite a talent. The long blond wig she wears--the color--is quite a better shade of blond than the her real hair, bleached that hideous white color she usually sports. She does quite a nice acting job, and is a finer singer--even singing an old Mae West song--and she does nicely at that too. I don't think she is particularly pretty, with her awful nose and too close together eyes, but she is talented. Now, Cher. She looks just awful. I don't see why she took this role. She sings one or two songs, but is not at all animated in this movie. She does not dance, but just seems to sit around, walk around, stand around...so what is the big deal of having her. I will say it again: she just appears to sit around. Stanley Tucci who seems to be in so many movies these days (liked him in a lot in Julie and Julia) does a god job, Cam G. is all right--I mean that part could have been played by any young male actor, but his tattoos are too distracting. What is it with these young male actors and their hideous tattoos? I heard a lot of people compare this to Dreamgirls. I disagree. Big time. Dreamgirls is totally different. To me, it is a movie I could see over and over, and I did--perhaps 8 times. Burlesque does not do it for me. I do recommend it as an entertaining movie, the songs are sublime, the story is really and totally sort of unrealistic, but, again: it is pleasant enough.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"A little bit of glitz, a little bit of glamour and a little bit of CHER!","I normally like to watch dark and depressing films with a lot of substance, so every now and then you need a film like ""Burlesque"" to blow away the cobwebs and replace them with flashing lights and catchy tunes for your own entertainment. ""Burlesque"" is the exact opposite to what I normally watch and I loved every minute of it! ""Burlesque"" is a breath of camp fresh air, it's full of life and style. Everything is just a joy to watch, from Christina's raunchy routines to Cher's incredible one-liners, ""Burlesque"" has got it all. The obvious highlight for me has to be the wonderful Cher! She made this film as the stressed-out club owner, giving out some hilarious one-liners like ""How many times have I held your head above the toilet as you threw up everything but your memories"" what does that even mean? It doesn't even make sense and that is why she is just hilarious! Cher's acting is also superb, I've never seen her act before but she is fantastic and very likable indeed.However, it's not all rosy, because although Cher belts out an incredible power ballad that puts Christina's voice to shame (the bloody Cher wannabee!) Cher only gets to sing two songs! The first one being her in some very risqué clothing for an 80 year old (still looking fresh Cher). This is the Christina show and although she is actually a pretty good actress and bearable singer, she is just no match for Cher. Whenever Christina is on her own your just waiting for your next Cher fix because she has all the best lines and also is THE best character in the film.""Burlesque"" is also incredibly cliché. It has read all the rom com musicals in the business because ""Burlesque"" is something you could read like a book! but still, this only adds to the entertainment factor and you can't help but enjoy it more because of it.The directing and cinematography surprised me, with most of the dance and song sequences being filmed really well, and although the plot is something we've all seen before the script is hilarious at times and Stanley Tucci is also funny as Cher's gay friend/colleague.As I've said, ""Burlesque"" is a hugely enjoyable show, performed on a stage full of likable style and remarkable glitz (whatever that means). It boasts great acting (Cher), catchy songs (Christina), powerful voices (Cher) as well as unintentional hilarious lines. I shouldn't really like this mega camp-fest but I loved every minute of it.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"OK, let's all take a deep breath, and frigging relax, shall we?","So it's painfully clichéd; so it's achingly unoriginal; so it steals heavily from other movies; so it lacks any real depth... So what?Don't tell me you've never seen and possibly even enjoyed a perfectly flat and shallow pop-corn action movie just for the sake of it. Why should shallowness be an exclusive right of action flicks?""Burlesque"" is a perfectly enjoyable musical comedy that - unlike many other recent blockbusters - does not take itself too seriously, and in all fairness it's as unpretentious as it gets. True, it's basically a glossy and simplified remake of ""Coyote Ugly"" with some ""Chicago"" elements thrown in for kicks. But so what? Who ever said that a certain kind of plot can only be told once (again, cf. action movies). It's just as honest about only being meant to entertain as, say, ""The Hangover"", ""Red"" or even ""Mamma Mia!"". Not that one should compare it to any other film of the same genre, but the fact is that some films are simply not meant to be anything else but pure entertainment. And that's okay.On the other hand, the humour is refreshingly effective, and compared to ""Coyote"" this flick may actually be much more romantic, appealing and gripping.Yes, the carbon-copy elements we may have seen a thousand times might make our eyes roll like a merry-go-round (I for one could not believe they went as far as including even the robbed apartment twist from ""Coyote Ugly"" or - and that was priceless - the day-dream cut to Ali imagining herself on stage that looks exactly like the scene when Roxie first sees Velma performing in ""Chicago""). But these things happen all the time. It's not even relevant. People are taking ""Burlesque"" far too seriously, and certainly much more seriously than it actually takes itself.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Iowa girl with big voice and fabulous dance skills finds venue in L.A.,"I must say I have never seen Christine Aguilera sing and dance like this-she was absolutely fabulous-what a voice! And she danced with the athleticism and skill of the best of Broadway, as did all of her supporting cast. Cher's voice as portrayed seems to be holding up well, and she played her role with sophistication and style. The plot is the same old same old girl leaves small Iowa town to go to Hollywood and be discovered, but frankly no one cares abut the plot given that the singing and dancing are so utterly spectacular! The music was surprisingly original, at least to this reviewer, and served to showcase the lead voices well. The choreography was suggestive, exhilarating, and slick as would befit the venue in which it was performed. We just went to see this movie because it was raining and we couldn't play golf, but we wound up talking about the cast performances all the way home. Go see it!!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
An old plot favorite,"I would recommend this movie to people who wanted to be reminded of their old acting days or don't mind cheesy movies.The movie starts with Aguilera leaving her small country town. The first scene was so miserable I penned it for another bad version of Coyote Ugly or Showgirls. It pretty much is, but then the jazz hands came up with Cher's name on the big screen and you know it won't be that bad.Aguilera's acting skills are about at the level of an Acting 101 class, but when that girl open's up her mouth. That pretty face can definitely be a show stopper. Her scenes can really cheesy and predictable. If you don't mind this, and love a 90's movie house hunting montage then this might be your movie.I did think some of the side plots were adorable. I must admit Tucci is probably the best actor in the movie. His part did fit him perfectly, and if one much choose from the big name celebrities Cher and Aguilera weren't bad for their roles either. Sure I'd rather see a Broadway girl play the part of Ali, but Aguilera's vocal box will bring automatic money to the movie.It was a classic small town girl moving to the big city looking for fame. Definitely had the range of archetypical characters each one with bodies to drool over. They pulled out the story at the right time. It's been awhile, since a good movie musical. The economy is down and people would like to see their dreams come true, and with the popularity of Glee this is the perfect time to capitalize on an old plot favorite.",,Anonymous,Music
"Does exactly what it says on the box, and does it well","Cher! Christina! Sequins! You know exactly what you're getting into with this movie. And it's director Steve Antin's same approach that makes 'Burlesque' click. A movie like this will never be mistaken as brilliant cinema and Antin wisely keeps the politics light and the narrative tight, focusing instead on the towering presence of his two divalicious stars and a series of well-crafted musical numbers. The result is a competently-made, paper-thin pleasure that would be easy to criticise if it weren't so deftly handled. Christina Aguilera (as the small-town girl with big-time ambitions in a story that's been told a thousand times before) is no Meryl Streep but she holds her own here and truly excels when given the opportunity to do what she does best; put that incredible set of pipes centre-stage for her many show-stopping musical numbers. It's Showgirls-minus-smut meets Cabaret-minus-social-commentary. Cher, of course, tears up the screen and owns every shot she's in and it's an absolute thrill to watch this Grand-Dame of Divadom back in the musical spotlight. Stanley Tucci and Kristen Bell give able support in roles they have both played before, and 'Burlesque' brings all these elements together in a way that makes you want to watch it over again whilst at the same time being not-quite-brilliant. The 14A rating means it's lacking the edge that could've elevated this to camp-classic status but as an unapologetic, well directed and good looking treat this hits all the right buttons. Oh, and the soundtrack rocks.",,Anonymous,Music
